Between April and November 2020 – the most recent month for which figures have been published – Conservative MPs claimed almost £3m in housing rent on expenses.

The Observer has identified 42 Conservative MPs who claim their own rent on expenses while at the same time renting out other residential properties for at least £10000 a year in income. Among them are:

Kevin Hollinrake who claimed £2925 each month from April to November while owning a share of five different rental properties in York.

Paul Howell elected in 2019 for the “red wall” seat of Sedgefield who claimed £1917.50 every month from April to November while renting out 16 different houses and flats across County Durham.

Paul Bristow who claimed £10500 of his own rent on expenses between April and November while renting out three residential properties in London.

Sixteen Tory MPs rent out residential property in London according to the parliamentary register of interests while claiming their own rent on expenses. They include Liam Fox Geoffrey Cox James Cleverly and Philip Davies.

There is no suggestion any of the MPs have broken any rules. Because non-London MPs have to work from two locations – London and their constituency – they can claim rental costs for one of those homes on expenses.

Hollinrake was the only MP to respond to a request for comment: “It is true I own properties other than my constituency home but they are not in or near London so I cannot make use of them for parliamentary purposes.

“When I was elected to Parliament in 2015 I knew it would mean a substantial reduction in earnings compared with my earnings in the private sector which I was more than willing to accept to have the chance to try and make a difference to people’s lives. I do not consider it reasonable to have to pay my own accommodation expenses in London in addition to other costs incurred while living away from home in order to fulfil my role as a parliamentarian.”

The revelations come as the government freezes the local housing allowance (LHA) benefit this month meaning tenants will get the same amount of money as last financial year even where rents have risen by hundreds of pounds a year – effectively a benefit cut.

LHA is paid to private sector tenants on low incomes in or out of work. However only the lowest rents in each area are fully covered by LHA – those paying average rents are left with a shortfall that can drive them into debt.

By contrast in October alone 54 Tory MPs claimed at least £2000 each in housing rent on expenses – far higher than the LHA levels available to most tenants in London let alone the rest of the country. Welfare secretary Thérèse Coffey whose department runs the LHA system claimed £1885 a month.

A spokesperson for tenants’ union Acorn said: “To commit to this [LHA] freeze at the same time as huge swathes of the government’s own MPs are claiming extortionate amounts on expenses to pay rent on second homes is disgraceful and perfectly demonstrates the contempt with which they treat low-income people in this country – particularly given many of these MPs are claiming these expenses for second homes at the same time as raking in profit from homes they are renting out to tenants while already taking home salaries far beyond what most people could ever imagine.”

The Tory MP claiming the highest rent expenses is Helen Whately minister for social care. Despite earning £113612 as an MP and minister she claimed £3250 in housing rent from the taxpayer each month between April and November 2020 – £26000 in total during those eight months.

If Whately claims £3250 a month for the whole of 2020/21 she will receive £39000 towards her rent during the financial year. This is higher than the estimated average annual pay of her constituents the average full-time earnings in the UK the average nurse’s salary – and over double the average full-time care worker’s pay in 2019/20.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL25pa2UtYWlyLW1heC05Ny1vcmFuZ2UtYmxhY2stZG04MzM4LTgwMC1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Air Max 97 Orange Black DM8338-800 Release Date - SBD,"Following the release of the “Los Angeles” pair from the “City Special” series Nike will be releasing a similar Air Max 97 ahead of the summer months.

The contract — scheduled to be voted on at a special CUNY board meeting Monday afternoon — has provoked outrage among lawmakers and professors.

The proposed business agreement which involves about two months of work is unnecessary they said.

“Speaking of things that make you go hmmm — $3 million for two months of high-priced consultants on a plan for which there are already enough highly paid CUNY officials while students continue to suffer from a shortage of full-time professional faculty” said state Sen.John Liu (D-Queens) the former city comptroller who chairs the senate’s panel on New York City education.

“This is not what we just increased the CUNY budget for” added Liu referring to the recently passed state budget.

John Jay College Professor Elizabeth Hovey also sent an e-mail blast to CUNY officials under the subject heading “Don’t Spend $3Mill on McKinsey – use CUNY expertise and value Students.”

“I have learned that you are planning to spend millions of taxpayer dollars on advice that you did not develop with all the loyal expertise of CUNY experts on health and security you could draw on. How dare you?” she said in the e-mail obtained by The Post.

Hovey an officer with the faculty union the Professional Staff Congress also referred to McKinsey & Co’s checkered history.

McKinsey agreed in February to pay $573 million to settle allegations that it fueled the opioid epidemic when it helped Purdue Pharma boost sales of the drug.

The Cuomo administration also brought on McKinsey in April 2020 to address issues leading up to the state’s eventual reopening after the COVID-19 pandemic. The consulting firm worked with state Department of Health officials on a controversial report on COVID nursing-home deaths that was later rewritten by Cuomo’s aides to hide the number of fatalities according to a report.

The low-balling of nursing-home deaths is the subject of state and federal probes.

Another McKinsey pandemic-related effort in Florida’s Miami-Dade County was panned by an official there as nothing more than the firm “compiling data for us. And putting it in pretty formats” according to a report by ProPublica.

An Albany insider said the CUNY contract came out of nowhere and is standing out like a sore thumb.

“Where is this coming from? Why does CUNY need to hire an outside firm to do this work?” the source said. “Isn’t that what the administration on the campuses and the central administration is supposed to do — plan for the reopening? This is great work if you can get it!”

Gov. Andrew Cuomo has considerable sway over CUNY. He appoints most of the governing board members.

Former city Comptroller Bill Thompson is the CUNY board chairman and state Budget Director Robert Mujica a CUNY- Brooklyn College alum sits on the board.

CUNY has been mostly on remote instruction since the coronavirus pandemic began in March 2020.

But the system’s schools had already formulated reopening plans in anticipation of returning last fall according to CUNY’s Web site.

Citing the pandemic CUNY waived its bidding requirement and only looked at McKinsey and another firm for the re-opening contract according to a draft resolution.

The proposed hiring agreement noted McKinsey was providing a 33 percent discount for the project.

Meanwhile CUNY was in such dire financial condition last year that Chancellor Felix Matos Rodriguez in November ordered furloughs for hundreds of top staffers.

CUNY spokesman Frank Sobrino said of the proposed consulting contract “McKinsey will contribute extensive logistics expertise and experience to the task of safely re-opening our campuses to in-person instruction this fall.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtpY2tzb25maXJlLmNvbS9hcHAvYWlyLWpvcmRhbi01LXRvcm8tYnJhdm8tcmFnaW5nLWJ1bGwtMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Air Jordan 5 Toro Bravo (Raging Bull) 2021 DD0587-600,Originally released back in 2009 alongside a black “3M” pair as part of the “Raging Bulls/Toro Bravo” Pack this Air Jordan 5 gets covered in a Varsity Red suede all over the upper with Black accents hitting the eyelets inner liner the Jumpman on the tongues and heels and the midsole.

Abbott: San Antonio is not a city to send migrant children packing,"Gov. Greg Abbott should have known better than to come down to San Antonio for a staged photo op in which he called on the Biden administration to pack up nearly 2000 migrant children housed at Freeman Coliseum and send them somewhere else anywhere else.

Flanked by members of his security detail stone-faced under their Stetsons Abbott certainly won the media attention he craved as he sternly cited unsubstantiated reports of a sexual assault inside the all-boys facility inadequate meals and supervision and an especially unlikely claim that COVID-infected minors were being housed together with healthy migrant residents.

Although the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services oversees the temporary migrant shelter at Freeman Coliseum Catholic Charities a nonprofit arm of the Archdiocese of San Antonio is providing the volunteers. The faith-based organization is deeply experienced in migrant care.

The immigration crisis of course should discomfort us all regardless of political affiliations.

The governor’s made-for-television appearance had the feeling of a hastily organized highly orchestrated political stunt. Empathy for unaccompanied minors fleeing violence and hopelessness in their Central American homelands was not part of the script. Abbott did not provide any evidence to support the unattributed complaints received by state agencies nor did he explain where he thought so many homeless children ought to be temporarily housed if not here in San Antonio.

That puts him out of step with people here and days later a caravan of Democrat lawmakers offered their own press conference decrying Abbott’s “political bombs” and demanding that he back up his assertions with evidence even as the governor asked Vice President Kamala Harris in a letter to close the facility.

Aquí puede leer sobre la conferencia del viernes en la que los legisladores demócratas criticaron al gobernador Abbott por “lanzar bombas políticas”.

Perhaps it’s our city’s own daily experience with poverty and exclusion that makes San Antonio so receptive to helping others in need. Someone should have told Abbott that San Antonio makes for a poor backdrop of his exclusionary instincts and opportunistic attack on the Biden administration.

Kudos to newly elected Bexar County Commissioner Rebeca Clay-Flores (Pct. 1) who provided the much-needed voice of reason and comfort to the moment. Clay-Flores is working as a vetted volunteer with Catholic Charities conducting Bible study classes for teen migrants. Her view of the situation inside the temporary shelter is a far different one than the one alleged by Abbott.

Remember Abbott flying to the Texas border to hold a press conference attacking the Trump administration for its inhumane treatment of detained migrants two years ago? Neither do I. That’s because it never happened despite widespread abuses against adults and minors and the preventable deaths of migrants in federal detention. Suddenly the presence of migrants in the state is a problem for the governor.

Given the chance governor San Antonians are inclined to take whatever fishes and loaves we have on hand and multiply them for less fortunate people seeking refuge here. Especially children.

When Phil Hardberger was in the opening months of his first term as San Antonio mayor in 2005 Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans leaving tens of thousands of residents homeless. Many of them were welcomed here at massive shelters established at the former Kelly Air Force Base and the former Windsor Park Mall recently purchased by a young tech investor the city would come to know quite well named Graham Weston.

An assistant city manager from Phoenix named Sheryl Sculley was due to start work as city manager in San Antonio a month or two later but seeing thousands of Louisiana residents bussed into the city she hopped a flight to San Antonio to get a hands-on look at the situation alongside Hardberger. That’s where I first met her.

I remember watching a CNN interview with Hardberger where he announced the city’s arms despite scarce resources were open to all who needed shelter in contrast to other mayors who said their cities lacked the space and resources to take in so many temporary residents.

The moment helped define a very successful mayor and how people outside San Antonio came to see the city and its culture. Fast forward 13 years and San Antonio became the northbound way station for thousands of desperate migrant families fleeing Central America. This time the influx was mostly mothers with children released from detention cities on the border and traveling to various states to connect with family and friends already established in the United States.

Once again a city with scarce resources and no appreciable state or federal assistance opened its arms to thousands of vulnerable people needing food shelter comfort and clothing and a helping hand as they continued their journey.

In both the 2005 and 2018 surges of people in need coming here San Antonio became a better city showing its best side even with far fewer resources than wealthier cities. So for now let’s do whatever we can to comfort and shelter migrant children while we await the facts on the vague complaints cited by the governor. That’s the San Antonio way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtrdHYuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMTAvYXQtaG9tZS1jb3ZpZC0xOS10ZXN0cy1ub3ctYXZhaWxhYmxlLXRvLWFsbC1wdWJsaWMtZmFjaW5nLXdvcmtlcnMtaW4tY29sb3JhZG8v0gF9aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua2t0di5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8xMC9hdC1ob21lLWNvdmlkLTE5LXRlc3RzLW5vdy1hdmFpbGFibGUtdG8tYWxsLXB1YmxpYy1mYWNpbmctd29ya2Vycy1pbi1jb2xvcmFkby8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At-home COVID-19 tests now available to all public-facing workers in Colorado,"COLORADO SPRINGS Colo.

Yarmouth Port - Elizabeth Jean Hemeon passed away peacefully at her home in Yarmouth Port on March 30 2021 after having been diagnosed with cancer one year ago. Elizabeth lived her last year dealing with her illness and with the restrictions that it and the pandemic brought with grace dignity modesty and very few if any complaints. During that time her family and friends surrounded her with constant companionship and loving devotion.

Born in Medford MA in 1927 Elizabeth was the fifth of six children. She was raised in Malden and graduated from Malden High School in 1945 going on to graduate from Fisher College in Boston. She worked as a medical secretary and led a social group at the Malden Universalist Church where she met and later married William M. Hemeon before moving to Cape Cod. Together they built and operated The Vagabond's Rest Motel and The Colonial Country Store in South Yarmouth. They went on to be co-owners of the Music Box Theater and many motels and inns on Cape Cod and Lenox MA as well as on the island of St. Croix USVI.

As a member of the Barnstable Unitarian Church for 58 years Elizabeth was a past chairperson of the Religious Education Committee and a church school teacher a member of the Prudential Committee and a treasurer of the Building Fund Alliance. She was also an American Heart Association volunteer a member of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children a member of the Yarmouth and Kings' Way Garden Clubs and a local leader of the Girl Scouts and Campfire Girls.

She loved to travel and was fortunate to have visited almost all of the United States including Alaska and Hawaii with her husband. Together they also visited Africa Europe Asia Central America and the Carribean but her favorite travels by far were the family trips that ""Grandmommy"" and ""Granddaddy"" hosted including a paddlewheel boat cruise up the Mississippi River a stay at a dude ranch in Arizona a vacation in an old Tuscan villa and several sojourns on Caribbean Islands.

Elizabeth had a zest for life and the energy to spend on it! She spent many hours of her life cultivating her gardens. In her middle aged years she developed a passion for playing tennis and continually worked on improving her game. In her later years she practiced yoga and took long daily walks until her illness made it impossible to continue. She derived so much pleasure from visiting museums and attending symphonies plays and musicals on the Cape as well as in any of the many cities she visited. She was a voracious reader burying herself in the Boston Globe the Cape Cod Times the Register and various magazines and books on myriad topics. Elizabeth attended many adult education classes and Elder Hostel seminars and watched Jeopardy every evening.

Elizabeth was predeceased by her husband William M. Hemeon her son Bradford Robbins Hemeon her parents Louise (Riha) and William Simpkins her brother William Simpkins and her sisters Ruth (Simpkins) Powers and Barbara (Simpkins) Adams.

She was a beloved mother grandmother sister and aunt. Elizabeth is survived by daughter Jan Elizabeth Hemeon (George Abbott) of Barnstable son Scott William Hemeon (Ann Lewis) of Ft. Lauderdale and daughter Gretchen Caroline Hemeon (M. Judson Graham Jr) of Dennis. She leaves behind granddaughters Amanda Abbott Caroline Abbott (Robert Moccia) grandsons Coleman Graham Addison Graham Campbell Graham and granddaughter Miel Hemeon. Elizabeth is survived by one sister Louise (Simpkins) Gannon of Wakefield MA and one brother Charles Simpkins of Seattle WA. Elizabeth also leaves behind over 25 nieces and nephews.

The family sincerely thanks Hospice Nurse Cindy Mancini and Hospice Social Worker Sarah Stevenson for their expert advice constant support and gentle care and Hospice Volunteer Judy Bourassa for her kindness and friendship.

Burial will be private. Donations if desired may be made in Elizabeth's memory to:

After the 1981 Brixton uprising which caused 279 injuries to police and £7.5m-worth of damage in the form of burned vehicles and buildings the voice of black Britain could no longer be ignored.

Alongside her black and Asian colleagues Bernie Grant Paul Boateng and Keith Vaz Abbott’s election marked a significant moment in black British history. But Abbott knew she was entering a hostile environment not least because her own party saw the bold young candidates as “an embarrassment”.

“If you tried to talk about racial justice in the early 80s you were just dismissed by those on the right of politics even on the right of the Labour party as someone with a chip on their shoulder” she says.

Boateng now a Labour peer echoes this sentiment noting how the party’s antipathy was emblematic of British attitudes at the time. “Britain had not come to terms with the fact that it was a multiracial society. There were many in Britain who somehow believed it was all a nightmare and one day they would wake up and we would be gone.”

Before 1981 politics largely dealt with the growing number of ethnic minorities as part of a “migrant problem” that could only be solved by keeping numbers to an absolute minimum. In 1978 the then Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher claimed in an interview for ITV’s World in Action that British people feared being “swamped” by immigrants from Pakistan and the rest of the “new Commonwealth”.

Before entering parliament Lord Boateng was a lawyer and activist in nearby Loughborough Junction who cut his teeth as a legal adviser to the “Scrap Sus” campaign in the late 1970s.

Police relied heavily on the “sus law” – which allowed them to stop search and potentially arrest people purely on suspicion of breaking the law – during Operation Swamp 81. Within five days 943 people had been stopped and searched with 82 arrested.

“The campaign was symptomatic of a sense of deep and abiding injustice that was felt not just among black youth but right across the inner cities. But Brixton was the historic centre of the black population and that’s where the spark was lit” says Boateng. He recalls watching the uprising unfold. “You could smell the smoke [coming from Brixton] and you just knew things weren’t ever going to be the same again.”

For all the progress of the last 40 years – Abbott and Boateng are both clear about how much has changed for the better – there is still significant scepticism towards the government’s commitment to tackling racial disparities.

“The fact that this government went to such trouble to construct a commission on racial disparities which was really about pushing back on the notion of institutional racism shows they still don’t take it particularly seriously” says Abbott. “Tony Sewell’s commission wants to take the race debate back to where it was in the early 80s.”

Indeed Britain’s race debate bears a similarity with 1981. The government’s Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities was set up after a summer of protest in the wake of George Floyd’s death. After Brixton came the Scarman report the first in Britain to acknowledge “racial disadvantage” although it too denied that “institutional racism” was widespread in British society.

“The political system did what it always does in those circumstances: it appointed an inquiry. That’s what you do when there’s no other option” says Boateng.

In February this year the Stuart Hall Foundation published its own race report that revealed 589 different recommendations were made by 13 previous race reports and commissions between 1981 and 2017 – the vast majority of which have not been implemented.

Last year David Lammy Grant’s successor in the Tottenham constituency in north London and as a campaigner for racial equality in parliament captured the frustration of many critics angrily telling the government to stop prevaricating and implement existing recommendations with the words: “Get on with the action. Legislate. Move. You’re in government – do something.”

Boateng laments the UK political system’s failure to adequately address issues of race and structural disadvantage. “There’s still a strong element of denial and avoidance and we see that in the most recent contortions of the current government” he says.

“I want to build on the gains that have been made over these past 40 years not see them disparaged and dissipated. In 1981 circumstances demanded change and to a certain extent things did but not enough and the struggle continues.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG5jcmljaW5mby5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc2Vhbi1hYmJvdHQtd2VpZ2h0cy11cC10aGUtcmlza3MtdG8tcHVzaC1mb3Itd29ybGQtY3VwLXNwb3QtMTI1ODQzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sean Abbott weighs up the risks to push for World Cup spot,"Sean Abbott has had a fine season in domestic cricket and wants to keep pushing for Australia selection • Getty Images

Sean Abbott admitted that there have been days during a long season when finding the motivation to train has been difficult but after a brief break he is ready to keeping playing in order to push his case for a T20 World Cup spot.

Abbott's Australian season will come to a close over the next 10 days with two finals - the Marsh Cup and Sheffield Shield - as he aims to hold all three domestic titles aloft having also been part of the Sydney Sixers side to secure the BBL then he will head to the UK for a spell with Surrey in mid-May.

The state campaign is stretching further into April that it normally would due to the impact of Covid-19 on the schedule and Abbott's season effectively began in mid-August when he travelled to England with Australia's white-ball squad.

After returning from that tour there was two weeks quarantine before he went into the Sheffield hub in Adelaide then to Australia A duty before returning to the Test squad after a calf strain. He then slotted into the Sixers line-up before resuming duties with New South Wales following the postponement of the South Africa Test tour.

Being selected in that Test squad meant he was unavailable to be part of the T20I team that went to New Zealand and it's the carrot of the World Cup in India that has been a large driver behind taking up a deal with Surrey which will see him available for the entire T20 Blast tournament.

""It's something I certainly had a few conversations with my girlfriend about. She's working full time and the times I am home it's not like I get to spend all day with here"" he said. ""Was something we had to talk about seriously then obviously the risks with Covid but it's a World Cup year.

""I missed out on the trip to New Zealand having been selected in the South Africa squad and with a lot of guys playing really good cricket there's a lot of competition for those spots for tours at the back end of the year. Weighing up the risks of going away and trying to improve and trying to challenge for those spots.

""It's another heavy workload being away for eight to ten weeks with quarantine on the back of that it was the risk I was willing to take given the year we have ahead.""

There is plenty of motivation for the last two matches of the season with a pair of titles at stake - facing Western Australia for the Marsh Cup on Sunday before defending their Sheffield Shield title against Queensland in Brisbane - but Abbott is actually grateful to have been sidelined for a couple of weeks by injury

""There's definitely been tough days rolling out of bed sort of trying to work out where you are and what you are up to that day"" he said. ""Splitting my webbing open [against Tasmania] was almost a blessing in disguise even though I hate missing cricket games but it allowed me the chance to visit my family spend some time with them and my girlfriend.""

Working from home changing travel patterns and a growing desire to shop locally are challenging industries to fundamentally rethink how they cater to the pandemic-adapted consumer. The latest survey of more than 9650 people in 19 countries supports Accenture’s previous findings that many changes in behavior will likely be long-term.



“The ripple effects of the pandemic will be felt for some time and serve as a powerful illustration of the need for consumer-facing companies to be agile resilient and responsive to change” said Oliver Wright senior managing director and head of Accenture’s global consumer goods industry group. “Born out of disaster and necessity comes opportunity; the pandemic has sparked a new wave of innovation. As companies fundamentally rethink ways of doing business that deliver growth many are using advanced analytical capabilities to spot respond and target changing consumption trends. For instance British beer company Brewdog responded with agility and creativity throughout the crisis —shifting to produce hand sanitizer creating virtual bars setting up the Brewdog Drive-Thru and repurposing physical locations to create co-working space with Desk Dog.”



COVID-19 has led to compressed transformation with companies simultaneously transforming multiple parts of the enterprise and reskilling people in what previously would have been longer-term step-by-step programs. Many consumer-facing companies have re-platformed their businesses in the cloud addressed cost pressures and continued to build resilience and security putting the infrastructure in place to enable innovation and position them for future success.



Dawn of the “third space”

The pandemic forced a rapid shift to employees working from home with many expressing that they want flexibility in how and where they work moving forward. More than three-quarters (79%) of respondents said they would like to occasionally work from a “third space” — a location other than their home or place of employment — and more than half said they would be willing to pay up to US$100 per month out of their own pockets to work from a café bar hotel or retailer with a dedicated space. This highlights a potential opportunity to grow revenue for the hospitality and retail industries.



The desire to work from a “third space” is accompanied by a shift in attitudes towards business travel. Half (46%) of respondents said they have no business travel plans post-pandemic or they intend to cut previous business travel by half. How long this view will hold firm remains to be seen but the current outlook indicates that the return to travel will resume principally within the leisure market pushing the industry to adapt and become even more efficient to make up for lost income.



“The pandemic has forced ’creative pragmatism’ especially for travel and hospitality firms grappling to find additional revenue streams during the crisis” said Emily Weiss managing director and head of Accenture’s global travel industry group. “Some hotels turned rooms into pop-up restaurants while others experimented with offering temporary office space to customers seeking a ‘third space’ to work. While there has been experimentation with innovation in select pockets companies need to scale these new services and address travelers’ renewed focus on health and safety for example by using the cloud to help enable fully contactless interactions.”



Shifts in consumer habits are here to stay

Not only do people think some of their work habits and travel plans have likely permanently changed many also think their shopping habits have evolved for the long haul. The latest research supports Accenture’s previously released findings that the dramatic rise in e-commerce is likely to remain or accelerate further. For instance the proportion of online purchases for products such as food home décor fashion and luxury goods by previously infrequent e-commerce users — defined as those who used online channels for less than 25% of purchases prior to the outbreak — has increased 343% since the outbreak.



Jill Standish senior managing director and head of Accenture’s global retail industry group said “Leading retailers were quick to adapt to the surge in e-commerce and are using technology to serve customers in new ways. Many adopted disruptive technologies such as augmented reality to recreate the physical store experience and help shoppers better visualize a room of furniture or an outfit while others repurposed closed stores into local fulfillment centers with picking and packing technology. Even in a post-pandemic world companies will need to satisfy consumers’ appetite for online shopping with fast delivery and get more intentional about the investments they will make in their people supply chains physical stores and digital channels to be well-positioned to drive growth.”

Internal Amazon documents show the company has a five-tiered ranking system for employee performance reviews and expects managers to rank 20% of employees at the top level 75% in the middle tiers and 5% in the bottom tier.

More than half a dozen employees who spoke with Insider said the tier system was evidence of stack ranking a controversial performance-review system in which employees are evaluated on a curve and a certain percentage must rank at the bottom — which could hurt both an employee's compensation and their future at the company.

Employees who have been part of the performance-review process told Insider the ratings had to be distributed across teams.

Stop reading now if you’re not ready for some brutal honesty because I’m about to serve up some tough love!

If you’ve read my previous posts on the zodiac signs you’ll know that there’s something to adore about every single sign. Each of the twelve signs in the zodiac brings a unique energy to the cosmos; however there are certain aspects of each sign that are (at best) obnoxious and (at worst) toxic as hell. Some signs have a reputation that you might already be familiar with—Scorpios and Geminis get a lot of flack—while others signs have negative traits that are better hidden. But often just as gnarly!

To note: I strongly believe that there are “bright” and “shadow” aspects or positive and negative aspects for every single sign. Basically I’m saying that there are no inherently good or bad signs by default! For every good trait that a sign has there is another that may be more destructive or frustrating. The bright traits emerge when people feel cared for and supported while the shadow traits emerge when they feel disempowered.

In this post the bad habits I’m referring to are according to your sun sign. However you can also read each of these mini-drags (oops!) through the lenses of love communication or action/aggression by finding out which signs correspond to your natal Venus Mercury and Mars respectively. Enjoy—and don’t get too salty!

Aries

Aries your worst habit is being a major workaholic! Because you’re the first sign in the zodiac you always want to run the show—even if it means you suffer from serious burnout after.

Taurus

Taurus your worst trait is that you’re resistant to change. You want to be so firmly grounded that you stagnate and get angry when you have to change your routine job or lifestyle. Practice being more flexible won’t you?

Gemini

Gemini you have a massive ego. It can often get in the way of interactions with other people—remember you’re not the main character in anyone else’s story babe.

Cancer

Unlike what most other pop astrologers say Cancer your worst trait isn’t your sensitivity—it’s your anger. If you’re in shadow mode and someone attacks your ethics or support system you lash out. Cool it!

Leo

Leo you’re way too concerned with other people’s opinions. You’re so focused on being the center of attention and commanding the room that you often forget to care for yourself.

Virgo

You’re a perfectionist Virgo! Everything doesn’t have to be perfect nor will it ever be. No one will judge you or be angry at you if things aren’t exactly as you want them.

Libra

Sorry Libra—you are mysterious and aloof to the point of obnoxiousness. You’re the person who likes to get other people interested in them but you often just come off as snooty.

Scorpio

Scorpio your sign rules drama. You love making life harder for yourself for the sake of your art. Let it go you beatnik—life doesn’t have to be dramatic to be memorable.

Sagittarius

Sag you’re overly defensive when people question you (especially your adventurous lifestyle!). While it’s important to stick up for yourself you can get unjustly pissed off when people try to ground you.

Capricorn

Stop hiding your feelings Capricorn. If you’re upset speak up! It doesn’t serve you to keep your emotions on lockdown in that seemingly-icy heart of yours. Warm up!

Aquarius

Aquarius you have a tendency to be really pretentious. You also like being the smartest person in the room and making other people feel inferior. Humble thyself.

Pisces

Pisces your worst trait is your neediness. Everyone has to rely on someone else once in a while but you often take it too far. Developing resilience will make you stronger in the long run.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMTAvdGhlLWJlc3Qtd2F5cy10by1zaWduLWVkaXQtYW5kLWFubm90YXRlLXBkZi1maWxlcy1vbi1jaHJvbWVib29rcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The best ways to sign edit and annotate PDF files on Chromebooks,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMTAvdGhlLWJlc3Qtd2F5cy10by1zaWduLWVkaXQtYW5kLWFubm90YXRlLXBkZi1maWxlcy1vbi1jaHJvbWVib29rcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vc3R1ZHlmaW5kcy5vcmcvYm90b3gtYnJhaW4tcGFya2luc29ucy1kaXNlYXNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Botox sheds light on 'inner workings' of the brain may unlock treatments for Parkinson's disease -,"NEW YORK — Botox is best-known for its “fountain of youth” effects on an aging face but scientists have uncovered a new use for the toxin. Researchers at New York University say Botox helps to reveal the inner workings of the brain — which could lead to treatments for Parkinson’s disease.

The botulinum toxin shows brain cells can gauge how much dopamine they need to produce on their own. Scientists had thought they relied on neighboring cells to tell them when to make more or less of the “feel-good hormone” which is vital for healthy brain processes including motivation memory and movement.

This new research discovers dopamine cells might not need their neighbors’ opinions after all.

The death of dopamine-releasing brain cells is a key factor in Parkinson’s disease. About 60000 adults are diagnosed with the condition each year in the U.S.

“Our findings provide the first evidence that dopamine neurons regulate themselves in the brain” says lead author Dr Takuya Hikima in a university release. “Now that we better understand how these cells behave when they are healthy we can start to unravel why they break down in neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson’s disease.”

A number of flaws in the “old way of thinking” about how dopamine is released in the brain prompted the researchers to carry out their investigation.

First for cells to control the dopamine output of others a large number of connections known as synapses would be needed. Yet there were not enough synapses to account for this the researchers say. Also given many other hormone producing cells self-regulate there was no reason dopamine neurons would be any different.

Dopamine neurons were collected from dozens of mice and some were injected with Botox. The toxin blocks nerve cells from sending chemical messages.

“By injecting Botox into single neurons we hoped to show whether any signal to continue or stop dopamine release could only come from outside the paralyzed cell” says Dr. Hikima. “If the neurons were in fact controlled by neighboring dopamine cells then dopamine release would remain unaffected because the treated cells would still receive dopamine signals from the untreated cells nearby.”

Cells which had been blocked with Botox produced 75 per ent less dopamine the study shows. This suggests they were primarily relying on their own discharge to regulate the hormone’s release.

“Since our Botox technique helped us solve the problem of how dopamine neurons regulate their communication it should also enable us to uncover how other nerve cells interact with each other in the mammalian brain” says senior author Dr Margaret Rice.

The researchers are planning to examine other areas of dopamine activity which remain poorly understood. In particular they’re studying how self-regulation could kill brain cells in Parkinson’s patients and whether it is affected by calcium levels.

The findings are published in the journal Cell Reports.

Only announced to its “AMD Red Team Community” via email the limited edition graphics card shares the same performance specs as the regular version but receives a special black shroud with gray/silver highlights around the center cooling fan.

While the consideration was there from AMD the lucrative business in selling GPUs due to the global shortage has once again made this new release unobtainable for fans. The card sold out within minutes with the help of bots and scalpers. And to make matters worse a special “Red Team Link” that was sent to the community was reportedly not working for some. Many gamers also brought up the fact that if AMD really wanted to get the GPUs into the hands of gamers they could have used things like non-transferrable passwords a raffle system or even only authorizing sales to verified users.

The $649 USD card is now impossible to find at retail and is fetching upwards of $1700 USD on eBay. Better luck next time.

He was 92.

Naisbitt died peacefully at his second home near Lake Woerthersee in Austria his wife Doris Naisbitt said on Saturday. His death on April 8 was earlier reported by the Austrian news agency APA.

Naisbitt was born on Jan. 15 1929 in Salt Lake City and grew up in Glenwood Utah. Early in his career he was an executive at Kodak and IBM and he was appointed assistant secretary of education at age 34 in the administration of President John F. Kennedy.

John Naisbitt seen in 2006 when his book 'Mindset' was published died April 8. He was 92.

Naisbitt's book “Megatrends: Ten New Directions Transforming Our Lives” was about understanding the present in order to predict the future. It sold more than 14 million copies in 57 countries.

Naisbitt published several other books some of them dealing with the rise of China. He also founded the Naisbitt China Institute a research institution studying the transformation of China and gave many lectures on future studies during his career. The Naisbitts lived in Vienna but had been traveling to China at least four times a year over the last couple decades.

“John was not only a man with great foresight he was open and without prejudice and not tied to any mainstream thinking” said his wife whom he married in 2000 after she was his German language publisher.

“He was not only a visionary man he was a kind and gentle human being with a sophisticated mind” Doris Naisbitt said.

In addition to his wife he is survived by five children and 12 grandchildren.

Holmgren scored 18 points to go along with 13 rebounds seven assists and two blocked shots in the victory.

“It was a great way to send us (seniors) off into our next part of our journey — whether that’s football for some of our guys basketball other things — definitely a great last hoorah for all of us” Holmgren said per the Pioneer Press. “We just wanted to make sure that we went out with a bang.”

Alexandria led Minnehaha Academy 7-5 early in the game before Holmgren and his teammates ripped off a 14-0 run that put the Redhawks up 28-12 late in the first half. Minnehaha suffocated Alexandria defensively throughout the game limiting it to 21% shooting from the field and just four made field goals in the second half. Tennessee State commit Hercy Miller led Minnehaha with 24 points on 10 for 14 shooting.

Holmgren will leave Minnehaha Academy with four state championships to his name the latest being his first coming in Class 3A. Minnehaha won its sectional championship in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic forced the state tournament to be canceled.

Now that his high school career is in the books Holmgren can turn his full attention to his high-profile recruitment. Holmgren the No. 1 recruit in the class of 2021 will indeed choose a college with Gonzaga currently the favorite to land the seven-footer. Holmgren’s other finalists are Georgetown Memphis Michigan Minnesota North Carolina and Ohio State.

“It is great to see the fans (on social media) trying to lead me to their school” Holmgren said in January. “I am not letting it play too much into my decision because at the end of the day I have to find what is best for me and my future. Wherever I end up going I am sure their fans will be the happiest for me.”

Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing the company usually creates value for its shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise if a company's revenue and earnings are declining the value of the company will decrease. Embraer SA's 3-year average revenue growth rate is worse than 88% of the companies in Aerospace & Defense industry. Embraer SA's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -41.3% which ranks in the bottom 10% of the companies in Aerospace & Defense industry.

Story continues

Another way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months Embraer SA's return on invested capital is -9.16 and its cost of capital is 3.96. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Embraer SA is shown below:

Before she and her sisters became synonymous with lingerie-clad selfies Kourt was already posing in her bra and underwear in front of the camera. Need proof? Look no further than her latest Instagram post.

""90s vibes only! (1999 to be exact!)"" the eldest Kardashian sibling wrote alongside two throwback photos of her 20-year-old self in a black lacy bra and matching boy shorts. She wore her hair in a high ponytail with double face-framing tendrils pulled behind her ears — a signature style of the decade.

Aside from the frosted lips and jazz hands (remember those?) the snapshots could've passed as present day. In fact Kourtney did manage to fool some of her followers into thinking the photos were taken recently. ""I can't tell if this is now or from 1999 either way you look the same"" wrote actress Lauren Perez. Another user chimed in with a similar sentiment adding: ""You literally do not age 🥺🥺🥺.""

The photos were posted to Kourt's IG feed in promotion of Poosh's upcoming wellness festival. ""Meet me at our second Poosh Your Wellness Virtual Festival on May 1st. General admission is FREE but you must RSVP"" she continued in the caption. ""Grab your PYW tickets now - poosh the link in bio for all the dope deets!""

At the summit Kim Kardashian will offer a plant-based cooking class while Kendall Jenner and her 818 Tequila will host a virtual happy hour. No word yet if Kourtney plans to teach a masterclass on her secret to staying ageless but our fingers are crossed."

Some discount stores in particular have failed to take basic actions to protect consumer health according to a new report entitled ""Who's Minding the Store? A Report Card on Retailer Actions to Eliminate Toxic Chemicals."" The findings which have been disseminated annually for the past five years were released last week. For the third year in a row the California-based 99 Cents Only Stores received a failing grade while other discount retailers such as Dollar Tree and Dollar General improved their below-average standing. While the discount sector was considered the ""most improved"" retail sector overall many stores are still failing to move aggressively to protect consumers.

""In many of our communities we are already overburdened by multiple exposures to toxics be it the production of toxic chemicals or the refining of fossil fuels that are made into chemicals that are put in products and then come back into the waste stream into our communities as well"" said José Bravo a contributor to the report who is also the national coordinator for the Campaign for Healthier Solutions which co-published the report along with the Mind the Store campaign. Both initiatives were launched to advocate that retailers phase out chemicals like Bisphenol A phthalates and the so-called ""forever chemicals"" known as PFAs from their products and packaging. Since their first report card they have found that almost 70 percent of companies surveyed have improved their chemical safety programs. This year fifty retailers representing over 200000 North American stores were surveyed.

Many discount retail stores known as dollar stores are located in predominantly low-income areas and communities of color where residents are disproportionately exposed to chemical hazards because of their proximity to hazardous industrial facilities that produce toxic chemicals. These chemicals are in turn used to create household products like laundry detergent which are then sold back to these same communities by discount retailers. In some communities dollar stores are the only source for household essentials such as food and cleaning products. In 2015 the Campaign for Healthier Solutions found that these stores' products contain toxic chemicals that can cause cancer birth defects and other health and developmental issues.

""During this COVID year dollar stores have made banner profits"" said Bravo. ""They should be doing much much more.""

In Southwestern Louisiana Christine Bennett and her husband Delma Bennett have for decades battled the chemical industry's intrusion into their once bucolic village of Mossville an unincorporated hamlet founded by former slaves near Lake Charles. The toxic pollution from sources like petroleum refineries and vinyl chloride manufacturers has driven out many of Mossville's longtime residents — including the Bennetts who moved to Lake Charles to protect Christine's failing health. However the couple kept their house and lawn service business in the hamlet and they've continued to raise awareness about the dangers of the chemicals polluting the environment and its residents through the organization Concerned Citizens of Mossville.

Two years ago Christine and her granddaughter protested with posters in front of a dollar store in Lake Charles to help inform consumers about the dangers in products containing toxic chemicals as well as the pollution created by more than a dozen industrial facilities that surround Mossville. But the Bennetts made little headway according to Delma because many residents simply can't afford to shop elsewhere. ""Nobody paid attention"" said Delma 77. ""The general public is not aware. They are not aware of the danger that we're under.""

Christine recalled taking a tour of one of the chemical plants as a teenager and learning how toxic chemicals are used to make soap and laundry detergent. When it comes to convincing others of the harmful consequences of producing toxic chemicals and failing to remove them from existing products she recognizes it's an uphill battle.

""How would you make a living if these places weren't open? Well we've got to show them how you can make a living"" Christine said. ""We've got to show them there's a better way to do it than to put out all of these chemicals.""

Most recently the chemical giant Sasol has been in the process of expanding its petrochemical plant in Mossville in part through the construction of a massive natural gas processing facility known as an ethane cracker. To do so the company has offered buyouts to the remaining Mossville residents. While the Bennetts said they'll likely take the buyout they want to ensure that they and others are ""made whole"" and receive the type of compensation that will allow them to relocate to a healthy environment. They long for what Mossville was like in its early farming days when people grew vegetables in their gardens raised livestock and drank clean water from wells they dug themselves. The hamlet was once filled with the sound of crickets and owls Christine said and lightning bugs were so plentiful that she could easily capture them in her hands. That changed as the factories proliferated.

""It's like we're in a desert in Mossville now"" said Christine. ""We have no oxygen to breathe but the bad air.""

Creating policies that address the entire life cycle of chemical products is a priority for environmental justice advocates; Bravo calls it a ""cradle-to-cradle"" approach. So while applauding the steps taken by retailers to improve their practices — 64 percent reported notable progress in their chemical use or policies since 2019 — last week's report found that others failed to demonstrate ""meaningful progress."" For example while some discount retailers have taken steps to identify toxic chemicals and create plans to replace them with safer alternatives the report found that the 99 Cents Only Stores company ""has done nothing.""

""We cannot stand by knowing that stores in our neighborhoods are selling products that are dangerous to our families"" Elizabeth Martinez a community organizer with Lideres Campesinas a California-based network of women farmworker leaders said in a statement. ""We will continue to hold these retail chains publicly accountable until we know that the products in these stores are safe.""

The Campaign for Healthier Solutions said that although 99 Cents Only Stores met with members of the initiative and committed to further discussions the discount retailer did not follow through. Last week the campaign urged the company to develop a safer chemicals policy set goals with clear timelines for reducing and eliminating chemicals of high concern and eliminate toxic additives in food packaging as well as chemicals in food and food contact materials in its supply chain. According to the retailer's website it operates 391 stores across four states in the Western U.S.

Representatives from 99 Cents Only Stores did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.

The Campaign for Healthier Solutions analyzed products sold in dollar stores across the country in 2015 and found that 81 percent of more than 150 products tested contained at least one hazardous chemical at concerning levels. Some of the chemical ingredients in these products have included toxic metals such as lead which has irreversible effects on a child's developing brain and can lead to cognitive deficits behavioral issues and educational delays. The tests also found phthalates which have been linked to cancer birth defects learning disabilities reduced fertility and other health issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(KWCH) - One person is dead three others hurt after a shooting at a house party at an Airbnb in East Wichita early Sunday morning according to police.

Neighbors in the 5100 block of E. Second Street called police around 3:00 a.m. to report hearing several gunshots and cars speeding from the scene.

When officers got there they say they found shell casings in the street and a 20- year-old dead in the backyard.

Police say three other victims all suffering gunshot wounds arrived at an area hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. They were a 26-year-old male a 17-year-old male and a 29-year-old male. They have all since been released.

Investigators spent the morning talking with eyewitnesses as they piece together what happened. Officers say cooperation from the victims has been limited but this does not appear to be a random incident.

Police say this isn’t the first time they’ve been called to this home by concerned neighbors.

Airbnb released a statement about the incident stating:

“Airbnb bans parties and we are appalled at the reported violence. Our team is urgently investigating this incident and have reached out to Wichita Police Department to aid in their investigation.”

Lt. Caron Nazario a member of the US Army Medical Corps was wearing his military fatigues when he was pulled over on December 5 in Windsor reportedly for driving his new Chevy Tahoe without license plates.

A temporary paper license plate was taped to the rear window.

Bodycam video shows that officers pulled their weapons and ordered him to get out of the vehicle.

The incident soon escalated when Nazario described as Black and Latino refused to comply saying he was afraid to get out of the vehicle.

“Yeah you should be” one of the officers said in response. Nazario was pepper-sprayed removed from the SUV and handcuffed while laying the ground.

“This is f–ked up” Nazario can be heard saying in the video. He also reportedly captured video of the incident on his own cell phone.

Nazario filed a lawsuit against officers Joe Gutierrez and Daniel Crocker on April 2 alleging his rights under the First and Fourth Amendments were violated.

“He’s a sworn member of the United States Army. He swears an oath to support to defend the Constitution of the United States from all enemies foreign and domestic — and the way these officers behaved this implicates the oath that he takes” said Jonathan Arthur an attorney for Nazario according to Vice.com.

According to Ezra Levant on Saturday a large number of police officers showed up at an Airbnb houseboat Rebel crews are currently using for accommodations and as a makeshift Montreal headquarters.

Various videos posted online show a large number of officers creating a perimeter and forcibly preventing Levant and Rebel staff from entering. Police taped off the area which Levant said was because officers were treating it as a “crime scene.”

Levant said no warrant was provided for the search.

In conversation with one of the officers Levant was told an investigation was ongoing inside the Airbnb saying no one is allowed inside until police have completed their work.

Video shows Rebel reporter David Menzies being placed in handcuffs and put into the back of a police cruiser. His colleague Keean Bexte was also handcuffed though was later released.

According to CTV News Montreal police said about a dozen people were onboard the boat. The police said no arrests were made but a report will be given to the Crown Prosecutor’s office.

The police claim individuals inside the houseboat were not following COVID-19 pandemic rules regarding masks and social distancing.

Rebel News has been in Montreal covering anti-lockdown protests and the heavy-handed approach Montreal police have taken to enforce public health orders. The online outlet’s journalism has resulted in thousands of dollars in fines laid against its journalists in Montreal alone.

In March Rebel News released footage showing a Montreal police officer asking in French if they were members of the “Jew media.”",,,

That’s why Urban Meyer took the Jacksonville job and that’s why the Jaguars are drafting Lawrence No. 1 overall on April 29 no questions asked.

But after Lawrence the best players in this draft are not quarterbacks. So it’s a bit curious that the Jets and Niners are acting with such certainty about BYU’s Zach Wilson and if the rumors are true Alabama’s Mac Jones.

Oregon left tackle Penei Sewell Florida tight end Kyle Pitts and LSU wideout Ja’Marr Chase are potentially franchise-changing talents and after Lawrence they are the players that have most of the teams in the top 10 drooling.

Granted quarterbacks are just treated differently. It’s the most important position. There is almost no prohibitive cost for landing a great one and teams who don’t have one are desperate.

So maybe that’s what is happening here: maybe desperation is ruling the top of this draft.

I just find it strange that a QB like Wilson who played behind a strong offensive line against weak competition is being treated as such a sure thing over some of these other blue chip prospects — let alone over Sam Darnold who I believe will light it up in Joe Brady’s Panthers offense.

I find it unusual that the Niners’ aggressive trade up would be for Jones who many evaluators considered a late-first/early-second round prospect prior to Kyle Shanahan’s reported interest.

I find it incredibly off that the quarterback who buried Lawrence in last year’s College Football Playoff Ohio State’s Justin Fields isn’t the one jumping toward the top of the board.

Trevor Lawrence is the only player who anyone should be sure of in this draft class.

Of course everyone evaluates these players independently and comes to their own conclusions. Some teams are in different stages of the process than others and that might dictate their desire or need to make a change for the long-term or to go all-in for now.

Also when you’re selecting No. 2 overall and you love a quarterback as the Jets do you take him because he’s there and you hope to not be picking there again for a long time.

Plus there’s the combination of a weaker projected QB class next year and this year’s uncertainty about so many prospects due to opt-outs and a compromised scouting process.

But I’m skeptical that suddenly three QBs are being fawned over as sure things with Fields and North Dakota State’s Trey Lance also projected first rounders when only one QB has warranted that praise the whole way.

Lawrence is the one generational talent in this QB class — so good that the No. 1 pick has been set for months — and yet others are being treated as the sure No. 2 and 3 picks as if they are no-brainer moves.

I could be wrong about these players. Wilson and Jones might become stars. But frankly I think the Jets and Niners are doing every other team behind them a favor by locking on to these other QBs because the better players are sliding down the board to their foes.

INJURY-APOLIS

This weekend was especially important in the NFL Draft process. About 150 prospects traveled to Indianapolis to undergo an in-person medical examination with an NFL medical staff.

The pandemic’s cancellation of the annual NFL Combine in late February eliminated the centralized medical gathering process that typically takes place two months before the draft.

Instead this year there were 330 virtual exams performed on the athletes with the NFL’s 32 medical staffs assigned about 10 athletes apiece. Labs tests and imaging were completed at designated sites closer to the athletes’ homes around the country.

But NFL evaluators still wanted more information and assurance even as GMs coaches and scouts gathered what they could themselves through trips to colleges’ pro days.

So this weekend was designed for teams to take a closer look at the top prospects as well as those with medical histories who warranted a closer exam.

Each team was allowed to send just one orthopedic surgeon and one athletic trainer this year. All NFL medical personnel in Indy are already vaccinated.

To limit players’ exposure to others not every team examined every prospect. Instead a select group of surgeons examined each player and will share that information with all 32 teams.

To reinforce the necessity for these protocols three Notre Dame players reportedly could not go to Indianapolis because they tested positive for COVID-19 after their pro day per NFL Network: OT Liam Eichenberg OL Aaron Banks and DE Ade Ogundeji.

There has been no indication that Giants offensive line coach Rob Sale who worked out Notre Dame’s linemen at their pro day has tested positive. But the Giants wouldn’t be obligated to make that public even if he did.

HARD KNOCKS

Attorney Rusty Hardin admitted at a Friday press conference that his client Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson has had sexual encounters with female masseuses. But Hardin and his legal team insisted any encounter was consensual and said Watson is “dumbfounded” by the 22 lawsuits he faces for alleged sexual assault and harrasment.

He said Watson started crying when first told that one of the lawsuits alleged he had used force on one of the women.

“Never at any time under any circumstances did this young man engage in anything that wasn’t mutually desired by the other party” Hardin said.

In court plaintiffs’ attorney Tony Buzbee agreed to share all of the identities of Watson’s accusers which Hardin said was necessary to fully dispute the allegations.

Attorney Tony Buzbee says his firm will represent 12 women in the civil cases against Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson accusing him of sexual assault.

In fact Hardin said the reason he hadn’t spoken publicly extensively prior to Friday was that “we don’t know what happened for sure.”

Hardin made a peculiar attempt to cite the pandemic as one reason for Watson’s frequenting of so many different masseuses. There are at least 40 involved in this case including the 22 lawsuits alleging misbehavior and 18 statements in defense of Watson as an upstanding man.

“Folks this guy has been getting two-to-three massages a week” Hardin said. “The math I do on that is anywhere from 120-140-150 massages a year. He’s been here since 2018. In the year 2020 all of a sudden spas shut down. If ya’ll remember nobody was getting massages unless there was an ad hoc way to do it.”

The main point Hardin wanted to get across on Friday though was that he felt Watson already had been tried and convicted on social media. Several sponsors suspended or dumped Watson 25 this past week including Nike and Beats by Dre and his career in the short term is in jeopardy too.

“What he wants more than anything” Hardin said “is to get back his reputation.”

PERFORMERS GET PAID

Wide receiver Darius Slayton led all Giants players with $502392 in performance-based pay in the 2020 season NFLPA records show. The lower a player’s salary the higher his performance-based pay when he logs a large amount of his team’s snaps. Defensive back Julian Love ($463271) center Nick Gates ($463723) tight end Kaden Smith ($350332) and defensive tackle Dalvin Tomlinson ($340776) rounded out the top five. Tomlinson has signed with the Minnesota Vikings as a free agent. The other four players are still on the roster.

BACK IN BLUE

Austrian running back Sandro Platzgummer is returning for a second Giants season as part of the NFL’s International Player Pathway program per a source. The program granted the Giants an exemption to carry Platzgummer 24 as an additional practice squad player last season who didn’t count against any roster limit. He was not eligible to play but spent the entire season with the team. Now he’ll run it back with the backs.

MORE COACHES?!

Joe Judge’s coaching staff ballooned to 28 this week with the hirings of three more assistants: offensive quality control coach Russ Callaway and defensive quality control coaches Carter Blount and Ryan Anderson. Anderson comes from Elon University. Callaway (LSU) and Blount (Tennessee) both worked with Judge a decade ago at Alabama.

Blount reunites with former Volunteers coaches Jeremy Pruitt (senior defensive assistant) and Kevin Sherrer (linebackers) on the Giants’ defense and with Craig Fitzgerald (strength and conditioning). Judge’s staff is now the largest in the NFC East based on teams’ officially listed staffs as of Friday morning more than the Eagles (27) Washington (25) and Dallas (20).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3dmb2xkc2Nob29sLmNvbS9iZWNreS1seW5jaC10cm9sbHMtZmFucy1hZnRlci13cmVzdGxlbWFuaWEtMzctbmlnaHQtMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Becky Lynch Trolls Fans After WrestleMania 37 (Night 1),"• Becky Lynch Trolls Fans After WrestleMania 37 (Night 1)

Cobalt is fast becoming one of the most sought-after commodities in the world. According to a report by New York-based leading business intelligence firm Expert Market Research the global cobalt market witnessed a demand of 115.54 kilo tons in 2020. The market is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 9% between 2020 and 2026 to reach a volume of 193.77 kilo tons by 2026. Industry experts believe that the need for the hard and silvery metal could grow four times the current demand in the coming years.

Growth Catalysts for Cobalt Stocks

The need for cobalt is driven by its use in several items critical to the world economy. Cobalt is a by-product of mining nickel and copper from the earth. The metal has to be processed before it can be made available in the market. Most of the mines where cobalt is found sites of nickel and copper mining are located in the Democratic Republic of Congo China Australia Russia Canada and some other countries. However most of the cobalt processing facilities are in China even though it only produces a fraction of the total Cobalt in the world.

This is partly to do with the high demand of cobalt in China. The metal is mainly used in lithium-ion batteries and semiconductor chips that are used in electronic devices and vehicles. Although it has other uses as well it is estimated that more than 41% of refined cobalt is used in batteries. The metal is used together with nickel in these batteries and there is as yet no commercially viable alternative to this pairing in the market. Since China is the largest manufacturer of electronics in the world the country has a monopoly on the import of the metal.

As climate change ushers in the era of electric vehicles more and more cobalt is being refined for use in electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Typically an EV battery requires 9 kilograms of cobalt whereas a smartphone battery only requires about 30 grams. Since the EV boom is just beginning it is unlikely that cobalt demand is going down soon. One of the best ways for investors to take advantage of this situation is by buying shares in the companies that are mining nickel and copper and by default cobalt around the world.

At the end of 2019 most market research firms were bullish on cobalt stocks. However the onset of the pandemic slowed down business. The grounding of aircraft - cobalt-based alloys are used in jet engines - hit the demand for the metal in the United States and Europe. Elsewhere the demand slowed as the coronavirus hit supply chains. Mining disruptions in African nations like Morocco and Madagascar also affected prices. With 2021 well underway there is still a lot of concern around the cobalt industry in the finance world.

After a former Alphabet employee published a tell-all article in the New York Times on her experience complaining about her manager over 500 Alphabet employees have sent an open letter to CEO Sundar Pichai alleging that the company frequently protects employees accused of harassment.

“Alphabet does not provide a safe environment for those who face harassment in the workplace. Even when HR confirms harassment no action is taken to make the reporter safe. For example Emi Nietfeld shared in the New York Times ‘My harasser still sat next to me. My manager told me H.R. wouldn’t even make him change his desk let alone work from home or go on leave’ the letter states.

Nietfeld who went on to leave Alphabet said she had accused a manager of treating her inappropriately at work. Following her complaint to H.R. she was made to have one-on-one meetings with her harasser and sit next to him and even when he was found guilty of violating the company’s Code of Conduct he was still placed next to her in the seating structure.

The open letter claims that Alphabet has often tried to protect or reward abusers citing an example where one person accused of coercing a co-worker into performing oral sex was awarded a $90 million exit package and how another was awarded $35 million after the was made to resign following a sexual assault investigation.

The letter calls for changes to policies including barring harassers from managing or leading teams and mandatory team changes for harassers following verified claims of harassment.

In 2018 over 20000 Google employees and contractors took part in a global walkout over sexual harassment and workplace culture at the company.

In 2020 Alphabet was ranked the world’s eight best company to work for."

After a former Alphabet employee published a tell-all article in the New York Times on her experience complaining about her manager over 500 Alphabet employees have sent an open letter to CEO Sundar Pichai alleging that the company frequently protects employees accused of harassment.

“Alphabet does not provide a safe environment for those who face harassment in the workplace. Even when HR confirms harassment no action is taken to make the reporter safe. For example Emi Nietfeld shared in the New York Times ‘My harasser still sat next to me. My manager told me H.R. wouldn’t even make him change his desk let alone work from home or go on leave’ the letter states.

Nietfeld who went on to leave Alphabet said she had accused a manager of treating her inappropriately at work. Following her complaint to H.R. she was made to have one-on-one meetings with her harasser and sit next to him and even when he was found guilty of violating the company’s Code of Conduct he was still placed next to her in the seating structure.

The open letter claims that Alphabet has often tried to protect or reward abusers citing an example where one person accused of coercing a co-worker into performing oral sex was awarded a $90 million exit package and how another was awarded $35 million after the was made to resign following a sexual assault investigation.

The letter calls for changes to policies including barring harassers from managing or leading teams and mandatory team changes for harassers following verified claims of harassment.

In 2018 over 20000 Google employees and contractors took part in a global walkout over sexual harassment and workplace culture at the company.

In 2020 Alphabet was ranked the world’s eight best company to work for."

Amazon's Shoppers. (Published 2021),"Here are some of the ways that people who have worked inside Amazon’s warehouses describe the experience: “The job crushed my spirit and crippled my body.” “The lowest point in my life.” An “isolating colony of hell.” “They’re killing people mentally and physically.” “I began to hate my day-to-day life.” “The way Amazon pushes people is not moral.” “I had whole days where I didn’t talk to anyone.” “The systematic devaluing of human bodies.”

Few of these accounts are new. But persistent horror stories have done nothing to diminish Amazon’s geometric growth. In 2017 the company’s head count surpassed 500000 employees. In 2020 Amazon added that many new workers very likely a record level of hiring for a company in a single year. Today nearly 1.3 million people work at Amazon making it the country’s second-largest private employer after Walmart. The majority toil in its sprawling fulfillment operations — they are the people who pick pack drive and deliver your stuff.

Are these workers happy? Is this good work? Should we rejoice about a company that can hire so many people in the midst of pandemic-induced mass unemployment? And one that in 2018 instituted a minimum hourly wage of $15 pushing Walmart Target and other competing retailers to raise their pay too?

Or should we recoil at the way Amazon has swept the apparent brutality of its operations under a haze of public-relations opportunism — the way it paints itself as a high-minded savior of American labor while its workers are so pressed for time that they must urinate and defecate in bags and bottles?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vcmVjb2RlLzIyMzc1OTY0L2FtYXpvbi11bmlvbi12b3RlLXJlc3VsdHMtd2hhdC1oYXBwZW5zLW5leHTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon union vote results: what happens after the Bessemer Alabama election,"Amazon has come out on top in the largest US union election in the company’s history. But the labor battle appears far from over.

The Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) announced on Friday that it planned to file unfair labor practice charges against Amazon over allegations of employee intimidation and manipulation. The union also requested a hearing before the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to go over its objections.

Meanwhile activists who’ve worked for Amazon said the election outcome will not stop more organizing efforts at other Amazon facilities in the US. And reports in recent months point to the Teamsters Union trying to organize other Amazon warehouses and delivery drivers.

In short the Amazon union conversation is entering a new phase. Here’s what to expect next.

What’s next at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer Alabama

Out of 2536 workers who voted in the union election at Amazon’s Bessemer Alabama facility (known as BHM1) 1798 voted against unionization compared to 738 who voted to unionize. Ballots from another 505 workers were challenged by either Amazon or the union but those votes won’t change the outcome so the election is over.

In a virtual press event organized by Amazon after the vote count ended four Bessemer warehouse workers who voted against unionizing said they believe the union lost because most colleagues appreciate the benefits they already have at Amazon and didn’t think they need a union to make changes.

“The union said that we would never have a seat at the table on our own but we actually have a seat at the table” said an Amazon worker named William Stokes. “Now we’re talking with senior management. … Over the next 100 days we are going to talk about things that we want to change. So change will come out of this.”

Stokes did not provide details of the changes sought.

Around the same time pro-union Amazon workers appeared with union officials at a separate virtual press event. The message they tried to get across was that they are not done speaking up or fighting for what they feel they deserve.

“Bezos you are wrong you are wrong all the way around” one Amazon worker Linda Burns said referencing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. “You misled a lot of our people.”

Amazon pushed hard to convince workers to vote against unionization. The company set up an anti-union website that harped on the fact that union dues would cost full-time workers close to $500 a year. What the company didn’t say on the website is that in Alabama unions can’t require workers to pay union dues. So a union at Amazon’s BHM1 wouldn’t be able to force workers to become members and pay dues or fees. Even in such a situation these employees would still be covered by a union contract and would be represented by the union if the company violated the agreement in a way that harmed the worker.

Amazon also convened mandatory in-person meetings during worker shifts to stress the downsides of unions sending frequent texts to workers with anti-union messages and encouraging them to vote no. The company went so far as to post anti-union flyers on employee bathroom stall doors.

The retail giant also did something else that appears to be even more controversial. Amazon pressed the United States Postal Service to install a mailbox on the grounds of the Bessemer warehouse right before voting started — and after the NLRB denied the company’s request to place a ballot drop box on the property. Some workers have said they were intimidated by the installation of the mailbox as well as the messages from Amazon to use it and believe that the company wanted to monitor who voted.

Amazon spokesperson Heather Knox previously told the Washington Post that “the RWDSU ... pushed for a mail-only election which the NLRB’s own data showed would reduce turnout. This mailbox — which only the USPS had access to — was a simple secure and completely optional way to make it easy for employees to vote no more and no less.”

The mailbox and the anti-union messaging around dues will both likely come up in the union’s complaints. The NLRB said that the parties “have five business days to file objections contesting the conduct or results of the election” and RWDSU has already said it will file unfair labor practice charges against Amazon for certain behavior during the campaign and election. The NLRB could choose to hold a hearing to find out more about the union’s claims if an investigation deems them credible. The labor board could then choose to throw out the results and call for a new election if it sides with the union.

Amazon union battles outside of Bessemer

The Bessemer union election whether or not the results are upheld will likely not be the last union drive at an Amazon facility in the US.

Christian Smalls a former Amazon assistant warehouse manager who the New York Attorney General says was unlawfully fired for his labor activism told Recode he is in the process of organizing workers at the Staten Island warehouse where he worked before Amazon dismissed him.

“Although we may not have gotten the results we wanted this time around this doesn’t discourage the workers of Amazon” he wrote in a text message to Recode. “If anything it motivates. We believe it’s possible even more so than before so I still consider this a victory for Bessemer to spark the fuse which ignited us all to be talking about unions again in this country.”

Related The real cost of Amazon

Smalls and others have created their own union the Amazon Labor Union that they hope will eventually represent workers not just in Staten Island but if successful at other Amazon facilities too.

There have been signs of labor organizing activity at other Amazon facilities in recent months of well. In Iowa for example a local chapter of the Teamsters Union has been working on organizing Amazon warehouse workers and delivery drivers. But a representative for the union said the group is trying to take a different tack than the RWDSU.

“We’re focused on building a new type of labor movement where we don’t rely on the election process to raise standards” Jesse Case secretary-treasurer of a Teamsters local in Iowa told the New York Times.

In the US union organizers typically need to win an election at each individual facility of a company like Amazon’s. Organizers first have to get 30 percent of workers to sign a card saying they are interested in a union. After that the NLRB will hold an election in which a majority of voters have to vote to unionize in order for the union to take hold. What Case of the Teamsters is describing is a more informal approach using protests and other forms of public pressure to get a company like Amazon to make changes in line with what workers want. An Amazon worker group called Amazonians United Chicagoland has also held protests and walkouts throughout the pandemic.

As for the RWDSU the union’s president said on Friday that the organization has heard from more than 1000 Amazon workers at other facilities who are interested in unionizing. But the union would not say for sure whether or where they might push for an election at other Amazon sites should the Bessemer appeal fail.

“I think it will be a moment to reflect and think about the best strategy moving forward” Rebecca Givan a labor professor at Rutgers University told Recode of whether the RWDSU might consider giving up on Amazon should their Bessemer challenge fail. “We might see other kinds of organizing in other Amazon warehouses rather than formal union drives under the NLRB process.”

It caused a tremor in American television history. As one CBS reporter put it “The NFL was ingrained in the walls of CBS like Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite.” The cost of sports rights took off. So did the cash cow of modern broadcasting—the TV “bundle” of sports and other stuff most of it barely watchable. At the peak in 2012 almost 90% of American homes subscribed to one pay- TV bundle or another.

Today that share has dwindled to about 65%. That makes the NFL even more important to the fortunes of the TV networks including Fox and CBS (now merged with Viacom). American football is the most-watched live sport in the country and sport trumps everything else for TV ratings and ad revenues. At a time when other entertainment is available at a sliver of the price from Netflix and other streaming services live sport is the only thing left to induce viewers to pay through the nose for pay- TV .",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYW1hem9uLXRpa3Rvay12aXJhbC1wcm9kdWN0cy1zdG9yZWZyb250L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Launched a Storefront of Viral TikTok Products from Butt-Lifting Leggings to Foot Peel Masks,"Yes it's true: You can now shop your favorite TikTok products all in one place on Amazon.

The Lena Waithe-produced show follows the Emorys a middle-class Black family who move into an all-white neighborhood in Compton Ca. during the Jim Crow era and are forced to contend with racial terror outside their new home and the supernatural horror lurking within its walls.

The screening began with a taped introduction by Compton Mayor Aja Brown who then interviewed series creator Little Marvin in a pre-recorded segment. Little Marvin told Brown that he had always intended to set the show in Los Angeles and had discovered Compton’s little-known history during his research.

“Compton occupies a very specific place in the public imagination” Little Marvin said. “It’s iconically Black — pop culturally culturally and musically what have you — but as I dug in I realized that not only is that not true but sixty seventy years ago it was quite white. Not only that but the folks in east Compton were virulently protective of their whiteness and the block. It was just lightbulb after lightbulb after lightbulb and I realized that we had found a home for the show.”

Popular on Variety

The Black family at the center of the story leave a traumatic past in North Carolina behind as they move cross-country in 1953 during the height of the Great Migration. Spanning from 1916 to 1970 the Great Migration saw the relocation of 6 million Black Americans from the south to the northeast midwest and west. With “Them” Little Marvin said he wanted to explore the American Dream as well as those who were given the keys to that dream who were not and why.

“And particularly the most emblematic piece of the American Dream in my eyes anyway which is the dream of homeownership” Little Marvin told Brown. “It’s a point of great pride particularly for Blacks in this country also because we have been disenfranchised from the real estate market since the dawn of the real estate market. So being able to explore the sort of darkness beneath the dream of homeownership and beneath the American Dream was the origin of the story.”

One of the first challenges faced by the Emorys upon their arrival in East Compton is the discovery of a racial covenant in their housing contract. Racial covenants were contingencies written into legal documents that restricted the purchase of real estate by Black homeowners. Though the law was found legally unenforceable in California during a 1948 court ruling Little Marvin said he wanted to delve into the legacy of segregation and its continued presence today.

“I think about my own journey and my own sort of questions and anxieties as it relates to real estate which I know I share with many Black folks across the country” Little Marvin said. “’Will I get that loan? Will I not get that loan? Will they look at my house? Is there a reason my house is getting appraised for less than it should be?’ These are all questions that are based on decades and decades of disenfranchisement within this market. I really wanted to explore that the seed of that and also explore the fact that we are very much still living in a segregated country in many ways.”

However bleak the show’s material may seem Little Marvin said he hopes to spark curiosity and compassion. “As dark as our show is I really set out to make a love letter to the families of the Great Migration” Little Marvin explained. “These are Black families who had scrapped and scraped through impossible distances to get to the cities in the west east and north only to be treated with some of the same terror and hatred and ire that they were trying to escape from in the south. Getting to share that story and hopefully spark a dialogue around these issues there’s no bigger gift than that.”

As attendees drove into the parking lot ahead of the screening they were greeted by the Compton Cowboys a group of ten neighborhood friends and horseback riders who have been a familiar sight on the city’s streets for the past three decades. Guests received gift bags with snacks from Black-owned businesses including Keith Kettle Corn Just Water Fleur el Sel and Pucker Up Lemonade Co. While DJ Hed performed a set on stage attendees could order food delivered to their cars from Black-owned food trucks Billionaire Burger Boyz All Flavor No Grease and Happy Ice all of which have roots in South Los Angeles.

ST. LOUIS — Energy company Ameren Missouri has requested to increase customer rates in 2022 to cover billions of dollars invested in electric grid upgrades and new wind generation facilities.

The company said in a filing last week with the state regulator Missouri Public Service Commission that it wants to raise electric rate revenues by $309 million a year an increase of 12% the Post-Dispatch reported.

The proposal would raise bills for an average residential customer by about $12 a month.

The company also filed a request to increase rates for its 135000 Missouri natural gas customers to net another $9.4 million in revenues a $4 monthly increase for residential consumers. The hike would enable Ameren to upgrade natural gas system reliability and resiliency the company said.

Ameren said it anticipates the new rates to go into effect early next year.

The utility says the rate hikes are justified by a range of investments including recent moves to bolster the reliability and resilience of the area’s electric grid and to acquire wind farms.

Ameren has upgraded substations and power lines strengthened utility poles and installed about 133000 digital smart meters that provide customers and Ameren with usage information. The company has also recently acquired two northern Missouri wind farms for a combined $1.2 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2NoYW5uZWwyMC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9iYWxsb29uLXJlbGVhc2UtY2F1c2VzLWNoYW1wYWlnbi1wb3dlci1vdXRhZ2XSAVZodHRwczovL25ld3NjaGFubmVsMjAuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2JhbGxvb24tcmVsZWFzZS1jYXVzZXMtY2hhbXBhaWduLXBvd2VyLW91dGFnZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Balloon release causes Champaign power outage,"If you live near Campustown and lost power Friday night you can thank a local Mylar balloon release according to Ameren.

More than 1200 customers in Champaign and Urbana lost power around 7:30 p.m.

The outage lasted three hours and was caused by Mylar birthday balloons becoming entangled in power lines.

Ameren warns that Mylar balloons are metallic and conduct electricity resulting in surges and shorts that have the ability to knock out power start fires and cause significant damage to the electric grid.

Ameren Illinois is asking its customers to properly dispose of Mylar balloons to help reduce the risk of power outages during outdoor party season.

“We realize this is the time of year when everyone is outside celebrating new graduates newlyweds birthdays and spring holidays” said Dave Wakeman Senior Vice President Operations and Technical Services for Ameren Illinois. “Keeping the balloons tethered and weighted while in use and then properly puncturing and disposing after the fact can help to ensure they do not get loose and end up in our power lines and substations.”

If you see a balloon or another toy entangled in a power line you're asked to leave it alone and call Ameren Illinois at 1-800-755-5000.

Getting in on the ground floor of a seniority-based company also has its perks. Pilots with higher rankings often have their pick of assignments over more recent hires allowing them to have better control over their flying schedule for example.

And the pandemic has given Breeze a lot of talent to choose from as airlines have been downsizing pilot pools with furloughs and voluntary leave programs. ""We've really been able to be selective and get the cream of the crop"" Coleman said.

Matching an aircraft with a lifestyle

Breeze plans to operate two aircraft types: the Embraer E190/95 and Airbus A220-300. Both have the same requirements in terms of minimum flight hours but each offers pilots a different lifestyle.

""One of our biggest pitches and approaches is: live when you fly and fly where you live"" Coleman said.

Pilots assigned to the Embraer fleet will return to their base every night instead of spending nights on the road. It's a concept that saves Breeze on hotel expenses but also allows pilots to spend more time at home.

""There's no commuting if you don't want to commute there are no more crash pads if you don't want to crash pad"" Coleman explained.

Allegiant Air operates a similar model and Coleman said Breeze applicants have been largely receptive to that idea because of the additional freedom it gives them to be ""at home every night with your family and your friends and your pets and have a life.""

But those seeking the typical pilot lifestyle of multi-day trips out on the road will find it on the Airbus fleet. More traditional flying consisting of two to three-day trips will be common on the A220 and pilots preferring that lifestyle should hold off on applying.

Pilots hired to Breeze now will be assigned to the Embraer fleet while the application window for the Airbus fleet will open early this summer. Once a pilot is assigned to one aircraft though they're locked in for at least three years before a switch can be made.

And those wanting to experience the life of an international jet-setting pilot will get to do so at Breeze just not straight away. The first year of Breeze's operation will be domestic-oriented but the airline plans to introduce international flights in the future spokesperson Gareth Edmondson-Jones confirmed to Insider.

Breeze's minimum qualifications

The basic requirements to become a Breeze pilot come down to flight hours. All applicants are required to have at least 1500 total hours with 1000 hours of experience flying fixed-wing turbine aircraft regardless of whether applying for the Embraer or Airbus fleet.

Military pilots however only need 1000 hours if that time was spent flying high-performance military aircraft.

Pilots looking to fly the Embraer fleet however will have to have a type rating for the Embraer E170/E190 while Airbus applicants are not required to have an A220 type rating since the aircraft is so new.

""We're really looking for those folks that have good time on the E-Jet to get us started"" Coleman said.

The type rating requirement for the Embraer fleet favors pilots flying the Brazilian aircraft for the likes of JetBlue or one of the country's regional airlines like Republic Airways SkyWest Airlines and Mesa Airlines that fly the Embraer E170.

""The Embraer 175 is a very popular regional jet"" Brandon Soloman Breeze's manager of pilot pipeline and development told Insider. ""The 190 being the same type rating yes it's almost kind of a natural step.""

American Airlines recently retired the Embraer E190 from its fleet in 2020 but those pilots would still be eligible as Coleman says the airline wants recency of experience from within the past two years.

From a college class to the right seat

Breeze is working with college aviation programs to implement ""pipeline"" programs that put aspiring airline pilots on a track to work at the airline.

Regional airlines frequently recruit at the college level and then major airlines recruit from the regional airlines using these programs. Student pilots are interviewed by the airline during their training and then put on a path to employment at that airline so that they'll have a job straight out of school.

Breeze plans to operate the program a bit differently by focusing on mentorship from experienced pilots to those still in training. Mentors will help not only help with the technical aspect of flying for an airline but also ensure candidates have the right ""cultural fit"" to meet Breeze's values.

""Our program will be very heavily focused on helping them make that transition a little easier than it might be at a bigger airline that doesn't have enough resources to focus"" Solomon said.

Colleges and universities already play a large role in the airline's hiring strategy. Breeze's flight attendants will be paid college interns that attend online classes when they're not flying.

Pilots won't go straight from the classroom to the cockpit however as they'll need to build up their flight hours to Breeze's requirements which is often done through flight instructing.

More than just a pilot

Minimum qualifications might get pilots in the door at Breeze but are no guarantee of a job. Recruiters are also looking to see if a pilot is a match with the airline's values and for customer service-oriented and safety-minded individuals.

""I think the biggest thing is they really need to be a good leader who will really take great care of our team members and our passengers and they've got to be nice"" Coleman said. ""We really are all about [how] nice and kindness goes a long way.""

Pilots will be expected to be on the frontlines as the airline gets off the ground and that means interacting with passengers in the terminal making pre-departure announcements in front of passengers instead of from the cockpit and being an overall brand ambassador.

""We want good pilots that are really good people"" Solomon said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL2xveWFsdHlsb2JieS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8xMC9zdWNjZXNzLWZpcnN0LXdlZWstd2lubmluZ3MtZnJvbS1hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1hYWR2YW50YWdlLTQwdGgtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktY2VsZWJyYXRpb24tZ2l2ZWF3YXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Success: First Week Winnings From American Airlines AAdvantage 40th Anniversary Celebration Giveaway,"The American Airlines AAdvantage program turns 40 this year and the airline has launched a giveaway to celebrate this milestone with prizes given away on a daily basis.

The prizes and themes of the giveaway rotate on a weekly basis with the first week being under the banner of “We the people [of American Airlines]”.

AAdvantage members can win from several prizes including 40 will each receive 1000000 miles!

John wrote about the giveaway last week (see his article here).

You can access AA’s page for the 40th Anniversary Giveaways here.

I have participated every day of the week with all “globe spins” available and was quite lucky. While there were some things in the basket of winning spins that I won’t use I was able to secure some miles.

Here are my winnings:

6x 400 AAdvantage Miles

2x 40 AAdvantage Miles

One American Airlines Preferred Seat Upgrade

One 20% off sitewide discount with FTD

A digital code redeemable for 20% off participating Hyatt properties when you book between April 1 2021 and May 31 2021 for stays through September 12 2021

A one-car class upgrade and a minimum 500 base AAdvantage Miles with Avis Car Rental

Only one spin didn’t win anything.

I won’t be able to use this prize as I’m already Executive Platinum and “Preferred Seats” are generally not much to write home about anyway. Just like the FTD discount and Avis Upgrade will find it’s way into the trash folder of my email. I’ll see what the Hyatt discount offers but more likely than not the same or less than the World Of Hyatt member rate.

Miles are a much better win in the bigger picture:

So far I’ve won 2480 miles in the first week and while that doesn’t sound like much every little bit counts and goes on the pile towards the next big redemption. According to the emails I received it will take up to 10 weeks to get the miles credited.

It’s also an account activity for those who are worried that their miles will expire at some point without movements on the account.

You have one daily spin plus another one to check your “daily fun fact” plus the initial spins displayed on the main website.

Conclusion

My winnings of the first week were decent. I don’t expect to win anything big from this giveaway but if I can get a few thousand AAdvantage miles then that’s already better than nothing.

Keep in mind that this raffle is officially for U.S. residents only although I’m not sure how they are going to verify that. The most logical way would be through the account address so if you live abroad you might want to change yours for the time being.

U.S. carriers including Southwest Airlines Co. American Airlines Group Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. parked a combined 67 of the workhorse planes Friday about a third of the Max jets currently in service around the world. The manufacturing fault affects aircraft at 16 airlines not the entire Max fleet Boeing said in a statement.

Chicago: Boeing Co. grounded dozens of 737 Max jets to repair an electrical flaw that emerged just months after the planes were cleared to return to the skies forcing airlines to cancel flights and line up replacement aircraft.

While the issue isn’t related to the flight-control system that was at the center of the Max’s nearly two-year grounding it takes the luster off the comeback of Boeing’s most important product. The Chicago-based planemaker has been picking up orders for the Max since U.S. regulators lifted the grounding in November and recently secured a bumper commitment from Southwest which had publicly flirted with a smaller single-aisle jet made by Airbus SE.

Boeing slipped 1% to $252.38 at 9:52 a.m. in New York the biggest drop on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The shares had gained 19% this year through Thursday twice as much as the Dow.

The newest Max disclosure comes as Boeing contends with quality lapses and manufacturing flaws that have damaged its reputation and affected its 787 Dreamliner KC-46 aerial tanker and Starliner spacecraft. The aerospace titan also has fired and sued a subcontractor on another high-profile project: turning two 747 jumbo jets into the next Air Force One fleet to haul U.S. presidents.

The latest issue was discovered by Boeing mechanics “on a production airplane during normal build activity” according to a message to customers that was reviewed by Bloomberg. Operators were notified just hours after a separate email touting the growing number of flight hours and planes in service since the grounding ended in the U.S.

Boeing declined to say how many planes were affected of the 183 Max jets that have been put back into service since December. About 20 operators have been conducting about 400 daily flights according to a separate memo.

“Boeing has traced the issue to a production change made in the installation process that occurred after our last aircraft was delivered before the fleet grounding in March 2019 which means 24 of our 737 Max aircraft are not affected by this issue” David Seymour American’s operations chief said in a message to employees Friday.

Boeing’s wouldn’t estimate how much time the repairs will require. “It could take a matter of hours or a few days” said Jessica Kowal a Boeing spokeswoman.

Airline impact

Southwest said it pulled 30 737 Max 8 jets from its schedule adding that it’s flying only 15 of its 58 Max planes daily and expects “minimal” disruption to its operations. The Dallas-based carrier said it hasn’t experienced any operational problems related to the electrical issue identified by Boeing.

American removed 17 Max planes from service while United stopped flying 16 and Alaska halted flights by four.

The Max Boeing’s latest generation of the decades-old single-aisle workhorse was grounded after two crashes five months apart in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019 in which 346 people were killed.

It was cleared to fly again by U.S. regulators in November with regulators in Europe and most other major markets following suit.- Bloomberg

Major disasters can leave thousands of people in the dark. The Texas deep freeze in February knocked out 40% of the state’s electric generating capacity.

During such events unaffected regions may have power to spare. For example during the February blackouts in Texas utilities were generating electricity from hydropower in the Pacific Northwest natural gas in the Northeast wind on the northern Plains and solar power in the Southwest.

Today it’s not possible to move electricity seamlessly from one end of the U.S. to the other. But over the past decade researchers at national laboratories and universities have been working closely with industry engineers to design an interstate electricity system that can. And President Biden’s infrastructure plan would move in this direction by allocating billions of dollars to build high-voltage transmission lines that can “move cheaper cleaner electricity to where it is needed most.”

My engineering research focuses on electric power systems. At Iowa State University we have worked to quantify the benefits that macrogrids can bring to the U.S. These high-capacity transmission systems interconnect energy resources and areas of high electricity demand known as load centers across large geographic regions.

A national highway system for electricity

Dwight Eisenhower had been thinking about a national interstate highway system for decades before he was inaugurated as president in 1953. Eisenhower argued that such a system was “as necessary to defense as it is to our national economy and personal safety.”

Congress agreed and passed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 which authorized the federal government to pay 90% of the cost of this $114 billion system with states covering the rest.

Eisenhower was worried about evacuating cities in the event of nuclear war. The security argument for a macrogrid focuses on extreme events that disrupt the power grid. And the economic argument centers on moving wind solar and hydro power from areas where they are plentiful to areas with high power demand.

Today the North American power grid is actually five grids also known as interconnections. Two large ones the Eastern and Western Interconnects cover most of the lower 48 states and large swaths of Canada while three smaller grids serve Texas Alaska and northern Quebec. Each of these grids uses alternating current or AC to move electricity from generators to customers.

The Eastern Western and Texas Interconnects are linked by high-voltage direct current or HVDC lines that make it possible to transmit power between them. These facilities are aging and can only transfer small quantities of electricity between grids. One way to think of a macrogrid is as an overlay that pulls together the existing U.S. grids and makes it easier to move power between them.

Sharing power across regions

President Biden has proposed sweeping action to achieve a clean energy transition in the U.S. including making electric power carbon-free by 2035. This will require adding a lot of new renewable generating capacity over the next 15 years.

Wind and solar costs have fallen dramatically in recent years. Today power from new large-scale wind or solar plants is cheaper than electricity from existing coal plants. Yet renewables provide only about 21% of U.S. electricity.

A macrogrid would reduce the cost of electricity from new wind and solar plants in two ways. First it would enable high-quality renewable power — mainly Midwestern wind and Southern solar and potentially Canadian hydropower — to supply coastal load centers. It is cheaper to build transmission systems that can move this power over long distances than to generate it from lower-quality weaker Sun and wind resources closer to cities.

Second a macrogrid would make it possible to share energy production and grid services between regions. This strategy takes advantage of time differences due to time zones and the fact that electricity demand tends to peak at certain times of day such as when people arrive home in the evening. And electricity prices rise and fall during the day with demand.

For example at 3 p.m. Pacific Time power demand is relatively low on the West Coast which means the cost of that electricity is also low. Excess Western electricity could be used to supply demand on the East Coast which peaks daily simultaneous with this 3 p.m. West coast “low” which occurs at 6 p.m. Eastern Time. Four hours later when the West Coast hits its 7 p.m. Pacific Time daily peak it would be 10 p.m. on the East Coast which would have extra generation to share westward.

Capacity sharing also works because annual peak power demand occurs at different times of year for different regions. Each region is required to have access to enough generation capacity to meet its annual peak load with some margin to cover generation failures. A macrogrid would enable regions to share excess generating capacity when it’s not needed locally.

This strategy provides benefits even when annual peaks in two regions differ by only a few days. When they differ by weeks or months the payoff can be large. For example power demand in the Pacific Northwest typically peaks in winter so the region could borrow capacity from the Southwest and Midwest where demand peaks in summer and vice versa.

Building transmission saves money

In a study that I published in 2020 with academic and industry colleagues we showed that without a macrogrid it would cost more than $2.2 trillion from 2024 through 2038 to develop and operate the nation’s electric power system and achieve 50% renewable power generation in 2038. This includes the costs of adding 600 gigawatts of new generating capacity that would be almost entirely wind and solar; operating costs for remaining fossil and nuclear power plants; and building new AC transmission lines to connect new power plants to customers.

However we calculated that if the U.S. spent $50 billion to develop a macrogrid the total long-term cost of developing and operating the nation’s electric power system and achieving 50% renewable electricity in 2038 would decrease by more than $50 billion. In other words by making it possible to share power across regions and deliver high-quality renewable power from remote areas to load centers the macrogrid would more than pay for itself.

Some observers may worry that a nationally connected grid would be more vulnerable to cascading blackouts than our existing system. In fact a macrogrid would actually be more reliable because HVDC provides increased grid control capability through its flexible converter stations.

Industry leaders and clean energy advocates are calling for the U.S. to pursue macrogrid development. But North America is lagging behind most of the world in developing interregional power lines to tap low-cost clean energy resources. And if $50 billion seems like a big investment consider this: It’s also the estimated minimum cost of outages and energy price spikes during the Texas deep freeze.

2. Iranian nuclear facility suffers 'suspicious' blackout

A ""suspicious"" blackout struck Iran's underground Natanz nuclear facility on Sunday just hours after starting up new advanced centrifuges capable of enriching uranium more quickly. Behrouz Kamalvandi the spokesman for Iran's civilian nuclear program told state television there were no casualties damage or contamination but the reason for the power outage remains unclear. Israeli media outlets meanwhile suggested a cyberattack occurred. The Associated Press notes these reports did not offer sourcing for the evaluation but ""Israeli media maintains a close relationship with [Israel's] military and intelligence."" Israel has previously been suspected of carrying out an attack on Natanz's centrifuge assembly plant in July and Tehran blames its rival for killing Mohsen Fakhrizadeh the scientist who launched Iran's military nuclear program decades ago last November. The blackout comes as world powers negotiate with Iran in Vienna over its nuclear deal.

3. China admits its COVID-19 vaccines aren't very effective

China's COVID-19 vaccines ""don't have very high protection rates"" Gao Fu the director of the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Saturday. The comments serve as a ""rare admission of the weakness of the vaccines"" by Beijing The Associated Press writes. ""It's now under formal consideration whether we should use different vaccines from different technical lines of the immunization process"" Gao said. China has already exported hundreds of millions of doses of two vaccines developed by state-owned drug makers Sinovac and Sinopharm to 22 countries including Mexico Turkey Indonesia Hungary and Brazil. It appears China may turn its focus to the development of mRNA-based vaccines like the safe and highly effective Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots even though Gao and Chinese state media had previously questioned their safety and effectiveness AP notes. Gao said other options such as mixing different vaccines or adjusting dosing regimens are on the table as well.

4. Supreme Court strikes down California pandemic religious restriction

The Supreme Court ruled late Friday night that California cannot enforce COVID-19 restrictions on in-person at-home religious meetings such as prayer groups and Bible studies in homes. The 5-4 decision was reached mostly along ideological lines with the conservatives remaining in the majority. Chief Justice John Roberts disagreed siding with the three liberal justices. In an unsigned opinion the majority wrote that even though California permits many business including indoor restaurants and movie theaters to allow more than three households to gather at a time that number serves as the limit for household religious gatherings suggesting the state ""treats some ... secular activities more favorably."" In a dissenting opinion the minority wrote that California is not required to ""treat at-home religious gatherings the same as hardware stores and hair salons"" and argued the ban is fair because it applies to secular and non-secular at-home gatherings alike.

South Korean battery makers LG Energy Solution and SK Innovation reached an agreement Sunday to settle disputes over electric-vehicle technology. The news likely caused the Biden administration to breathe a sigh of relief. LG had previously alleged its rival illegally acquired sensitive technology and the U.S. International Trade Commission subsequently issued a 10-year import ban on SK Innovations which put into doubt Ford's electric vehicles plans as well as a new battery plant in Georgia which is expected to provide thousands of jobs in the state. President Biden was facing a Sunday night deadline to decide whether he should reverse the ITC's ruling. He called the settlement ""a win for American workers and the American auto industry.""

6. Army officer sues Virginia police officers for violating his rights during traffic stop

U.S. Army Lt. Caron Nazario is suing two Virginia police officers for violating his rights. Nazario who is Black and Latino claimed in a federal civil lawsuit filed last week that the officers pointed guns at him pepper sprayed him and pushed him to the ground after a traffic stop. Nazario filmed the incident on his phone and footage was also captured by both officers' body cameras. The officers believed Nazario who was in uniform at the time of the arrest was missing a license plate on his new SUV (the lawsuit says he had temporary cardboard plates taped to the inside of his rear window). Nazario acknowledges he did not immediately pull over instead deciding to slow down and pull into a well-lit gas station for safety reasons. He was not ultimately criminally charged or cited for a traffic violation.

The 2021 Masters Tournament will head into the home stretch at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta Georgia on Sunday. Japan's Hideki Matsuyama leads the field after a brilliant 18-hole performance on Saturday. He's 11-under for the tournament and has a four-stroke lead on a group of four golfers — Americans Will Zalatoris and Xander Schauffele Australian Marc Leishman and the U.K.'s Justin Rose. All five of the leaders will tee off for their final round after 2 p.m. ET on CBS. If Matsuyama is able to finish strong and snag the famed green jacket it would mark his first major championship. The 29-year-old came closest when he finished second at the 2017 U.S. Open.

ESPN",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDQvMTEvZ2VvcmdpYS1iYXR0ZXJ5LXBsYW50LWRlYWwtbGctc2stNDgwODQy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deal reached to allow Georgia battery plant completion,"“We need a strong diversified and resilient U.S.-based electric vehicle battery supply chain so we can supply the growing global demand for these vehicles and components — creating good-paying jobs here at home and laying the groundwork for the jobs of tomorrow” Biden said. “Today’s settlement is a positive step in that direction which will bring some welcome relief to workers in Georgia and new opportunity for workers across the country.”

Backstory: The ITC in February ruled that SK stole trade secrets from rival LG and ordered a blockade on shipments of materials needed to make batteries at the plant. Though the ITC gave a grace period for automakers to switch battery suppliers SK threatened to abandon the project if the ruling was not overturned.

The ruling presented a potential blow to Biden’s ambitious electric vehicle goals. Though the ITC gave VW two years and Ford four years to find new suppliers the automakers said it would take them at least that long potentially causing them to turn to imported batteries or delay their new model releases.

Federal law gives the president and USTR 60 days to overrule any ITC decision and the ruling sparked an intense lobbying campaign aimed at the White House.

SK Innovation retained former EPA Administrator Carol Browner and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates to pressure Biden and Tai to overturn the decision. SK warned that Chinese battery suppliers might fill the void if it abandoned the plant.

LG maintained that SK was bluffing and would likely finish the factory. And even if it didn’t LG argued the abandoned plant would quickly be snapped up by another supplier eager to fill automaker demand.

Settlement: Throughout the process LG said it was open to a deal that would allow SK to build its factory in exchange for compensation for stolen intellectual property.

On Sunday the companies announced that SK would pay $1.8 billion to LG as well as a “running royalty” on batteries produced at the plant. The firms did not respond to inquiries about the size of the royalty payments or how long they will continue.

In return LG agreed to resolve the ITC dispute a parallel case at the D.C. Circuit Court and all legal issues in Korea as well as promising not to sue SK on the intellectual property disputes for 10 years.

Reaction: The settlement is welcome news for the Biden White House which now gets to avoid a sticky decision pitting swing state jobs against its commitment to upholding U.S. trade laws.

Had Biden upheld the decision Republicans were ready to pounce on the potential job losses. But had he overturned it progressives were ready to argue he should also waive IP protections for Covid vaccines which the White House has so far resisted.

Tai whose office would have been tasked with deciding whether to overturn the ITC decision pushed the companies to strike a deal in more than a dozen phone calls with the CEOs and other executives in recent weeks according to a person with knowledge of the conversations.

She also spoke with senior Biden administration officials and members of Congress including those from Georgia and Biden thanked her for “tireless work to resolve this dispute” in his Sunday statement.

“I congratulate both companies for working through their significant differences to resolve this dispute which builds confidence in their reliability and responsibility as suppliers to the U.S. auto industry” Tai wrote in a release of her own.

The deal was also welcome news to Georgia’s two new Democratic senators who had publicly pushed the companies to strike a deal rather than pressuring the Biden administration to overturn the decision.

Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff also rushed to take credit for the settlement on Sunday saying they spoke repeatedly to the battery company leaders as well as the Biden administration in recent weeks.

“Given the outstanding litigation between the companies it has always been clear that the best way to protect workers in Commerce — and the jobs Georgians were promised — is for the companies involved to negotiate a settlement in good faith” Warnock said in a release.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzI1Mzc5ZjU3LThhNDUtNGE1OC05ZDU1LTY4NWI2YzQ0ODhmNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,South Korean EV battery groups settle high-stakes US dispute,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

View the current offers here.

One constant of the pandemic has been a never-ending news stream from the wonderful world of Disney.

Parks closing parks re-opening (basically before any other travel or attraction) changes in the guest/park experience and now how the parks will deal with the pent-up demand of Disneyholics. It may sound crazy to head to a busy theme park in a pandemic but thanks to Disney's rules and procedures it's actually a pretty solid choice.

With my vaccinations complete I'm again headed to Orlando this July to meet a couple of other families for some solid Disney exploration and adventure. A trip to Disney World can easily cost thousands of dollars and can be a difficult trip to complete in its entirety on points and miles especially if you like to stay on Disney property.

But I love a good challenge. So here is a recap of how I'm covering the cost of travel tickets and food at Disney World using just my credit card reward points and perks.

Capital One Venture Miles for tickets and campsite

There are very few good options to get great value out of your points and miles for Disney tickets but Capital One Venture Miles from my Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card (currently available with a large limited-time welcome bonus) is a rare example where you can get the desired value out of your rewards.

With Capital One's ability to redeem miles to essentially wipe out travel charges you make to the card you can use Venture Miles to cover any travel expense charged to the card at a rate of one cent per mile. Since you earn 2x Venture Miles on all purchases this is equivalent to using a 2% cashback card to cover your Disney expenses.

For lodging I'll again be driving my RV down to Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground.

We stayed for a week last fall and found the campground to be such a fun Disney experience. It also happens to be the most affordable on-property location though still quite expensive as far as campgrounds go. The campground will cost me about $350 for three nights requiring me to use 35000 Venture Miles to erase the charge.

When it comes to park tickets there is one important note to make here: Disney tickets purchased directly from Disney by themselves do not count as travel and therefore cannot be erased. (They usually do when purchased as part of a larger lodging and ticket package.)

However Disney tickets bought from UndercoverTourist.com do traditionally count as a travel charge and you'll be able to erase the purchase with your Venture Miles.

For my dates this summer the three-day Disney Theme Park Base Ticket will cost $378.91 requiring me to redeem 37 891 Venture Miles to erase the charge. This puts the cost of my lodging and ticket at around 72000 Venture Miles and $0 out of pocket.

The Venture Rewards card currently comes with its highest-ever sign-up bonus: 100000 bonus miles after spending $20000 on the card within the first 12 months of account opening. This is awarded in two installments.

First you can still earn 50000 miles after you spend $3000 in purchases within the first three months of account opening. The second set of 50000 miles is awarded with a total of $20000 in spending in the first year on the card.

I recently picked up the Capital One Venture Rewards card for both my wife and me meaning with 200000 welcome bonus miles plus the miles earned to meet the minimum spend I'm happy redeeming 70000 of them to help make Disney free as far as my wallet is concerned.

Amex Platinum PayPal credits for Disney gift cards

At the start of January 2021 American Express unveiled a new temporary perk for The Platinum Card® from American Express cardmembers: an up to $30 monthly PayPal statement credit. Amex has automatically issued these monthly statement credits for eligible PayPal purchases that I've charged each month.

When I first heard about the PayPal credit I immediately thought of one of my favorite discount gift card websites that I know accepts PayPal: cardcash.com.

While I typically buy discounted gift cards from the site they also sell new gift cards for just about any amount including brand-new Disney gift cards you can order for exactly $30.

When you select checkout with PayPal a pop-up window will show you your linked cards including your personal Platinum Card from American Express which specifically tells you about the PayPal credit right on the pop-up:

Both my wife and I carry a personal Amex Platinum card and this is how I've been using each of our monthly credits.

With $60 in free-to-me Disney gift cards coming in every month by my July trip I'll have $360 in Disney gift cards saved up to cover food drinks and anything else I want to buy in the parks and on property.

Gas programs for free gas

I've written a couple of times about the self-admitted obsession I have with either not paying for gas or at the very least not paying anywhere close to full price for gas.

Whenever I have an RV trip coming up I begin to strategize about a month out how to earn enough credits in a variety of programs to cover the diesel I'll need to buy for the nine-hour drive to and from Orlando from my home in the Atlanta area.

Fuel Rewards GetUpside TruNow Pay with Gas Buddy Marathon's Make-it-Count Kroger Fuel Points and some targeted Amex offers can all make it incredibly cheap or free (depending on what promotions are occurring) for my summer drive to Orlando.

Bottom line

Through a combination of using Venture Miles earned from a sign-up bonus free Disney gift cards thanks to a new Amex Platinum monthly perk and a variety of programs that let you save on gas I should have my summer jaunt to Disney World be entirely free when it comes to cash required from my wallet.

There may likely be some unexpected cost of an RV part repair or something else unforeseen but as it stands I'm pleased with the different redemptions and strategy I have planned to cover my travel lodging tickets and food. Disney is always fun but it's that much more fun when the cost to me is $0.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsaXRlZGFpbHkuY29tL3AvdGhlc2UtZmFrZS1yaXZlcmRhbGUtYnJhbmQtbmFtZXMtYXJlLWV2ZW4tYmV0dGVyLXRoYW4tdGhlLXJlYWwtdGhpbmctNjY1OTAxODLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Fake 'Riverdale' Brand Names Are Even Better Than The Real Thing,"It's hard to pinpoint the most bizarre thing about Riverdale because the CW series is just so out there. With teens catching serial killers teachers hooking up with their students and possible alien abductions each season gets a little more outlandish in the best way possible. While there's so much to love about the soapy drama the fake Riverdale brand names seen throughout the series are one of the most beloved jokes to anyone who considers themselves an honorary member of the Core Four.

Since the show's 2017 premiere fans have found the clever brand tweaks to be some of the silliest easter eggs in the series. Basically the writers change well-known brand names to make the Riverdale versions hilariously on the nose. While it's unclear how they choose which names to change and which ones to keep catching a new thing that got Riverdale-d is always a fun surprise.

As you're watching Archie Betty Jughead and Veronica hook up with each other and try to save Riverdale from seemingly endless darkness keep your eyes and ears peeled. From candy to luxury goods no brands are safe in the creative minds of the Riverdale writers. Here are a few of the most iconic ones fans still get a kick out of today:

01 American Excess “Reporting my American Excess card as stolen? Well played"" Veronica told her mom when the two were battling it out in Season 1. Not to be confused with an American Express card an American Excess sounds like one that just begs to be spent on unnecessary splurges.

02 Barnaby's When Archie can't find his dad's wallet after Fred got shot at Pop's during Season 2 Veronica picks up a new one from Barnaby's not Barney's for him to use in the meantime. (Well she sends the family butler Smithers to get it but it's the thought that counts).

03 The 'Baxter Brothers' Books Move over The Hardy Boys. The Riverdale version of the series The Baxter Brothers are a little more twisted but still follow the same general idea: Teens somehow solve crimes that adult law enforcement professionals can't!

04 Butterflinger Nobody lays a finger on Butterfingers in the town of Riverdale... because they munch on Butterflingers instead.

05 Bean & Beluga The CW / Netflix While a bean and a beluga whale might not seem like the most luxurious trappings of fine dining if Riverdale's take on the New York bakery Dean & Deluca is good enough for Veronica Lodge it's good enough for me. Just make sure to pick up her favorite brunch item: a chocolate almond croissant.

06 CCC (Triple C) If you have a flat tire or need a tow in Riverdale don't call AAA; call CCC (or ""Triple C"") for a lift.

07 'Fibes' 20 Under 20 If you thought landing on the Forbes ""30 under 30"" list was goals Veronica's aspiration of getting on Fibes ""20 Under 20"" is even loftier.

08 The Five Seasons “It’s not the Waldorf nor the Plaza but The Five Seasons like all of Riverdale has its charms” Veronica said in Season 2 and the Riverdale equivalent of The Four Seasons has come up time and time again as the must-stay lodging site in Riverdale.

09 Fresh-Aid When playing Griffins & Gargoyles people would drink ""griffin blood"" (aka a punch sometimes mixed with poison) from a ""sacred goblet"" to prove their worthiness. Since this is Riverdale instead of Kool-Aid Fresh-Aid is the fruity drink of choice.

10 Game Lad Netflix / The CW When Mrs. Crabapple confiscates Hermionie Lodge's Game Lad while the Midnight Club severed detention during a flashback in Season 3 the group discovers the deadly Griffins & Gargoyles game.

11 Glamazon.com In Riverdale when you want to get your online shopping on you go to Glamazon (not Amazon) for essentials and unnecessary treasures alike.

12 Glamergé Eggs Popping up time and time again in the series Glamergé eggs are just as elusive (and expensive) as Fabergé eggs are IRL.

13 Griffins & Gargoyles Also known as G&G the role-playing game Griffins & Gargoyles is Riverdale's more lethal take on Dungeons & Dragons.

14 Grind’em When Kevin starts wandering Fox Forest for hookups in Season 2 Betty suggests he use Grind’em (you know like Grindr) instead.

15 Lacy's David Giesbrecht/The CW Why would a girl ever shop at Macy's when she could just swipe her mom's Lacy's card à la Veronica. Plus V's pal Katy Keene works there so it's a win-win.

16 Little Ciceros Little Ciceros is the go-to spot to order pizza in Riverdale. Just don't confuse it with Little Caesars since I'm pretty sure that doesn't exist in this universe.

17 Mall-Mart According to Kevin in the very first episode of the series tailgate parties in the Mall-Mart (you know like Walmart) parking lot after Friday night football games are a vital part of Riverdale's social scene.

18 'The Matchelorette' Grab your wine and your charcuterie board because Riverdale's version of The Bachelorette is probably just as dramatic.

19 Sarah Florence College It might not be Sarah Lawrence but Sarah Florence College is still a big deal especially because that's where Archie's mom went to school and made a lot of influential friends.

20 Senior Mints The CW / Netflix Riverdale is known for changing up the name of candies; in this case Junior Mints graduated to Senior Mints.

21 Shabbey Road Studios It's not the legendary Abbey Road Studios but in Riverdale Shabbey Road Studios — which Cheryl connects Josie with in Season 2 — is a close second.

22 Shankshaw Prison Judging by the Carrie musical and Shankshaw Prison (where F.P. Jones is held after Jason Blossom's murder) it appears the Riverdale writers are big fans of Stephen King.

23 Sharebnb Airbnb might want to take marketing tips from The CW because Riverdale's version of the home rental service Sharebnb has a nice ring to it.

24 Skit-Scat Break me off a piece of that Skit-Scat bar!

25 Spiffany's A Spiffany's bag is the Riverdale equivalent of a little blue box from Tiffany's.

26 Swizzlers Twizzlers are Swizzlers in Riverdale and the red candy is seen being eaten multiple times in the series so it seems to be just as popular onscreen as it is IRL.

27 TGI Thursdays I don't know who is especially thankful for Thursdays but in the town of Riverdale the popular chain restaurant goes by TGI Thursdays instead of TGI Fridays.

28 3 Buccaneers Who needs 3 Musketeers when you can have a pirate-themed candy called 3 Buccaneers ?

29 Triple Bubble Riverdale's best chewing gum added another bubble so you can pop some Triple — not Double — Bubble when you're in town.

30 Tucci The CW / Netflix A Tucci bag is just as coveted as a Gucci bag in Riverdale especially when it's monogrammed and filled with cash like the one the police found that implicated Hermonie Lodge in Season 4.

31 23 Hour Fitness The best thing about 23 Hour Fitness is that you don't feel bad about not using your gym membership 24 hours a day since it's open one hour less than its IRL counterpart.

32 'Vanity Flair' In Season 1 Veronica was faced with the ""impossible situation"" of being invited to both the Vanity Flair Oscar party and Elton John's Oscar party on the same night a horrid fate I wouldn't wish on even the Gargoyle King.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBzeWNob2xvZ3l0b2RheS5jb20vdXMvcHN5Y2hpYXRyaXN0cy9hbGktbmFqYWZpYW4tamF6aS1hZ291cmEtaGlsbHMtY2EvNzA5MTM20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ali Najafian Jazi Psychiatrist Agoura Hills CA 91301,Dr. Jazi is a double-board certified Adult and Geriatric Psychiatrist.

Here we take a look.

Who Is Si Woo Kim's Coach?

Despite being born in 1995 Si Woo Kim has been a member of the PGA Tour since 2013 securing his card when he was only 18-years-old. During his career he's claimed three titles including the Players Championship in 2017.

The South Korean has a bright future in the game ahead of him but who coaches Kim? We take a look here.

Who Is Si Woo Kim's Coach?

Claude Harmon is one of the most recognised coaches in the game and has been with Kim for around two years.

Harmon who teaches the likes of Dustin Johnson and Bubba Watson has coached the South Korean to one of his three PGA Tour titles the 2021 American Express.

After his victory Kim credited a session with coach Harmon on the week of the tournament.

“We're just working on backswing and like a more straight takeaway” Kim said. “I was a little inside before and so he just fixed that and just little things like that.""

“When I had the chance to win (previously) I didn't play very well. I had a lot of ups and downs as I tried to play aggressive and that actually made me lose. My coach (Harmon) talked to me about it a lot and even this week he told me there will be chances anytime and to keep waiting and be patient keep composure and believe in yourself. That's what I tried to do.”

It hasn't just been Harmon that has contributed to the success of Kim with yet another famous coach also previously coaching the South Korean.

Sean Foley has coached some big names in the past including Justin Rose and Tiger Woods and was part of Kim's biggest victory in 2017 the Players Championship.

The pair met through Kim’s caddie at the 2016 Arnold Palmer Invitational. Kim who was struggling to draw the ball and keep his ball-flight down was given a one-hour lesson at 6am the week of the tournament.

The following January at Torrey Pines Kim asked Foley to take another look at his swing. “It got really bad” says Foley who took on Kim full-time a few weeks later at Riviera. “We just worked and worked. Every week he got slightly better. But look he qualified for the tour at 17; we didn’t need to do a whole lot.”

The only other coaching influence Kim has had is his father from whom he learned the game by tagging along with him in Korea.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZmVlLm9yZy9hcnRpY2xlcy9ob3ctY29sb21iaWEtcy1jcmFja2Rvd24tb24tdWJlci1pcy1odXJ0aW5nLXRoZWlyLXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLWluZHVzdHJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Colombia's Crackdown on Uber Is Hurting Their Transportation Industry,"In his essay “Transportation in the Free Market” corporate executive Lovett C. Peters complains that “regulation of transportation is not in the best interest of the consumer. Regulation deprives him of access to the free market.”

These lines would not be out of place in an op-ed about the conflict that is currently raging in Colombia between government licensed traditional taxi services and ride sharing apps such as Uber Lyft and Cabify. Mr. Lovett was in fact writing about Boston taxi medallions in 1967.

Wi-fi and smartphones may have changed the way transportation services are delivered but they have not changed the debates over regulation and the free market. The artificial scarcity that Lovett objected to in 1967 Boston is the same as the one created for taxicabs in 2021 Bogota and in many ways the consequences are worse. Free market competition between traditional taxis and ride sharing apps should be allowed in Colombia and other Latin American countries where it will result in faster more efficient and most importantly safer service.

Transportation customers in Colombia have long suffered from poor service inflated prices and assaults perpetrated by Colombian taxi services. Consumers in Colombia complain that taxi drivers often do not want to take them to their destination are not available in peak hours and make them wait for an unreasonable amount of time for service. Furthermore taxi drivers frequently take longer routes in order to charge more. This is even more common when the customer is unfamiliar with the city or an international tourist. Many Colombian taxi drivers use a variety of techniques to overcharge customers. One method is to round the fee up. For instance if the meter shows $6.700 pesos they charge $7.000 pesos. In other cases the taxi driver pretends not to have change forcing the user to give up the remaining value.

What taxi users fear most however are the assaults and the crime that has become known as express kidnapping. In 2013 the DEA agent James Watson was killed in a taxi cab robbery. He was the victim of what is known as “millionaire ride.” During this kind of robbery the “passengers are taken to a spot where a driver´s accomplices are waiting. The victim is then driven to cash machines where they are forced to withdraw money.” At that time around 200 similar cases were reported and the police said that fifty or sixty percent of taxi cab robberies are never reported. In 2018 15 percent of robberies were perpetrated when the victim was using a transportation service. Predictably this long list of abuses has made Colombian citizens reluctant to use taxi services at all.

In 2013 Uber arrived in Colombia as an alternative transportation service offering high quality service at an affordable price. Uber enjoyed a good reception from users. It not only provided fast affordable and convenient service but also provided many unemployed people with a new job opportunity. In 2016 around 30000 drivers worked for Uber Colombia an average of 3 hours per day. By the end of 2019 Uber Colombia had 88000 drivers and 2 million users. Uber brought a short-term economic opportunity for both users and drivers.

In Colombia traditional public transportation services are highly regulated. Taxi drivers must have a special license and purchase a medallion “that gives drivers the opportunity to own the right to operate.”

The Uber smartphone app as well of those of similar ride sharing services also creates an added level of security for users. The service allows users to see the exact mileage charge per mile and amount to be charged to their debit or credit card. Users do not have to worry about having exact change to pay for the service. The information from each ride is recorded and accessible. It is possible to know the driver’s name reviews experience and availability. That information can help reduce the assaults and express kidnappings. The tracking features of the smartphone apps give consumers an extra level of confidence when using the service increasing the frequency of use.

In Colombia traditional public transportation services are highly regulated. Taxi drivers must have a special license and purchase a medallion “that gives drivers the opportunity to own the right to operate.” Also they need to be tax registered. The cost of the medallion or “cupo” is between 75 and 150 Colombian millions ($25000 to $50000 dollars). This can be as much as three times the cost of the taxi itself. The “cupo” creates an artificial shortage where supply is reduced and prices are high. Taxi drivers pass this cost to consumers while Uber drivers do not. Uber drivers also do not have to comply with any of the transport regulations in Colombia which means they can afford to charge less for the service.

Unfortunately the Colombian government has taken extreme measures to prevent innovation in the transportation sector and repeatedly sided with traditional taxi services over Uber and other ride sharing services. Although there was no explicit law banning ride sharing apps in Colombia the drivers’ lack of a ‘cupo’ has made them the target of the Transito police and users have posted multiple reports of police harassment of Uber drivers.

The current status of the transportation market in Colombia is unfair to all parties in different ways and must be changed through pro-market regulation.

The Colombian courts have also been friendly to traditional taxi services. As reported by Cruz Mantilla on December 20th 2019 “the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce ordered the immediate cessation of Uber services in Colombia.” Uber Colombia was accused of unfair competition customer deviation and anti-competitive conduct. On December 30th 2019 Uber disputed the court case and initiated legal actions to protect foreign investments under the free trade agreement between Colombia and The United States of America. Uber left Colombia on February 1 2020. However at the same time it announced that a similar Uber application would work temporarily. It attempts to get around the ruling by calling itself a car and driver rental service. Cotech the company that filed the initial suit against Uber Colombia already plans to sue over the new application.

The current status of the transportation market in Colombia is unfair to all parties in different ways and must be changed through pro-market regulation. As previously discussed the artificial shortage of taxi services created by the government has been inconvenient unfair and even dangerous for consumers. It has impeded innovation in the form of smartphone applications and prevented the additional supply created by tens of thousands of Colombians who are willing to try driving for Uber and other companies. This has created a new unregulated black market for rideshare drivers. It is also unfair to the traditional taxi drivers despite their support for the current system. Due to their higher costs from the ‘cupo’ and other regulations they cannot compete with the rideshare drivers on price. Because the traditional taxis are less accountable to consumers the abusive behavior of some drivers has given all of them a bad reputation.

A free market in which traditional taxis and a variety of ride sharing apps compete on equal terms would help to resolve the problems with taxi cab service in Colombia. Competition will improve the service and prevent abuses by providing better prices faster service flexible payments and greater tracking of rides and drivers. It will also eliminate the demand that drives the ‘black market’ Uber network that currently operates in large cities like Bogota. A free-market for cab services offers workers access to the “on-demand” economy and the possibility of working as independent contractors who manage their own hours location and frequency. Further increased competition in Colombia’s transportation sector will create more available supply and therefore lower prices for the users. If traditional taxi drivers are freed from the high costs and burdensome regulations currently in place they may be able to compete on price and service. The free market will encourage businesses and individuals to continue to innovate and improve services.

Unfortunately governments like the one in Colombia are uncertain as to how they should classify and possibly regulate Uber drivers and Colombia’s track record with taxis has created the current undesirable situation. It is possible that the policy debate will become further polarized or even corrupted resulting in legislation that is heavy handed ineffective or anticompetitive. Voters in Colombian metro areas must demand that their leaders become more efficient reliable and accountable. Perhaps a savvy tech entrepreneur will one day develop an app for that too."

Where can Asian Americans like me call home?,"Tokyo CNN —

Last summer a Chinese man approached me on a crowded Beijing street and asked me in Mandarin if I was Chinese American. It seemed innocent enough as I was speaking English with expat friends.

But after I nodded he switched to English and bellowed “go back to where you f**king came from”.

These stinging words are familiar for Asian Americans living in the United States. But it was jarring to hear the phrase shouted at me in China.

In the moment I let out a laugh: As a Chinese American I have now been told to get out of each country for the other. It was a moment of realization that regardless of where I go I will always be a foreigner.

I was born and raised in America but over the past few years I’ve lived in Beijing Hong Kong and now Japan – where the majority of people I’m surrounded by look like me and assume I’m a native. At first that gave me an inexplicable – albeit superficial – sense of belonging that I never felt in America.

In the US my answer to the constant question “where are you from?” is never enough. When I say America it’s almost always followed by: “But where are you really from?” Countless times I’ve been asked why I can speak English “without an accent.” And Asian American women’s experiences of racism are inextricably linked to misogyny. We’ve had nearly every part of our bodies (eyes hair feet mouths skin and even private parts) appraised on the basis of our race. Our personalities are assumed by strangers to be subservient.

Recently as US-China tensions have ratcheted up with rhetoric from both sides turning toxic I’ve also faced animosity in China for being American. Chinese state media has fueled anti-American nationalism calling the US the “enemy of the world” at the height of the US-China trade war. Meanwhile in America roughly nine-in-10 adults consider China a competitor or enemy according to a Pew survey.

“There’s this consistent theme that when there are tensions with an Asian country people who are Asian American or who look Asian American are often scapegoated” Christopher Lu former Cabinet Secretary to Barack Obama said on CNN.

The irony is that often Asian Americans have a traumatic complex or even non-existent relationship with the distant country they’re held accountable for.

This American life

My parents immigrated from China to the US for graduate studies before I was born.

Later my grandparents who had been farmers in China came to America to help care for my sister and me. They weaved pieces of their Chinese lifestyle into the fabric of our suburban American home doing what felt most familiar to them. They turned our yard into a vegetable garden using the produce for dumplings and other Chinese comfort foods.

Home comforts: dumplings made by Selina Wang's grandmother in Henan China. Courtesy Selina Wang

My grandparents never had the opportunity to go to school. They taught themselves how to read and write Chinese and proudly passed their knowledge to their grandchildren. Chinese became my first language.

I could barely speak English when I started pre-school. My mother became concerned about my thick Chinese accent so we started to speak English more at home. From there I only became more self-conscious of my “Chinese-ness.”

By elementary school I asked my parents to stop packing Chinese food for lunch. I only wanted PB&Js after getting teased for bringing brown-colored tea eggs – one of my favorite foods – to class. The other kids thought they were rotten eggs.

Moments like these made me long to be seen as the American that I am. My family their traditions and those of other Asian Americans in my community were part of the America I knew – a melting pot of cultures.

In fact it was China that felt foreign. During each annual summer trip there I felt like a tourist and deep down I wanted to be treated as such. I was so proud to be an American.

But with each visit I’d learn more about my family history and witness China’s rapid development.

First we would visit my father’s village in the countryside and he’d show my sister and me the mud hut he had once called home. He would often remind us that during the Cultural Revolution my grandmother had to water down a single portion of porridge every day to feed six people.

Then we would visit my mother’s family in Hubei province. More than a dozen of us would cram around a tiny table eating bowls of sesame noodles while her family would recount different memories of trauma fraught with political persecution and suicide.

My family told stories of poverty and oppression as though they were simple childhood memories. For my sister and me they were allegories with a single lesson: we should be grateful to be born in the US – a free tolerant and wealthy society. As immigrants they would say upward mobility can only come by putting your head down and outworking the rest.

Throughout the years however I began to notice the gap narrow between my relatives’ lives in China and mine in the US. Villagers in my father’s countryside town slowly gained electricity running water cars and phones. My cousins in the city no longer wanted clothes from America as gifts – they liked the styles in China more.

In fact there was almost no material possession we could bring from America they couldn’t already find in China. Yet as their physical quality of life improved their access to information worsened as the Chinese government tightened internet controls and censorship.

And as the pandemic spread around the world the news they read differed more and more from mine.

A landmark moment

I was living in Beijing when the coronavirus outbreak began reporting on cases of a mysterious new pneumonia in Hubei province in December 2019.

My cousin a nurse was working on the front lines at ground zero of the pandemic near Wuhan. We stayed in contact as she worked long shifts without enough protective equipment feeling the angst of being separated from her newborn son and family. My other relatives were under strict lockdown for months facing pandemic-induced fear and anxiety. The same stress we all now know.

When the pandemic reached the US my mother called me to say she desperately wanted to wear a mask outside. One of our close family friends had died of Covid-19 in Wuhan early in the pandemic and my mother was certain the virus was far deadlier than most believed at the time.

But she feared being discriminated against as “the Chinese lady who has Covid-19.” At the same time my Asian American friends were telling me they had been spat on yelled at in the street and even verbally attacked in restaurants for “bringing the virus to America.”

Meanwhile China and America engaged in a war of words over the pandemic. Then US President Donald Trump routinely called Covid-19 the “China virus” and “kung flu” fanning racism and hatred that fueled attacks on Asian Americans.

The Stop AAPI Hate advocacy group has tallied more than 3795 reported incidents of hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the US during the pandemic including the killings of six women of Asian descent at Atlanta spas which triggered rallies across the country.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said China represents America’s “biggest geopolitical test of the 21st century” as the only country with enough power to challenge the current international system. Meanwhile since 2010 China has been calling for a “new model of major-power relations.”

The difficult question for America’s leadership now is how to effectively confront Beijing without worsening discrimination at home against people who look Chinese. That means making clear distinctions – for the public – between the Chinese Communist Party the 1.4 billion people in China and millions around the world of Chinese heritage.

“For as long as Asian Americans have been in this country we’ve been treated as outsiders as people who can’t be trusted” said Lu the former Cabinet Secretary. “You can go all the way back to the 1800s with Chinese railroad workers to Japanese American internment during World War II to the Korean and Vietnam Wars and to rising trade tensions with Japan in the 1980s.”

As I see conversations between leaders of the world’s two largest economies descend into childish bickering I can’t help but think about all the Asian American lives uprooted or lost as a result of geopolitical disputes that are out of their control.

I also think about the younger me who just wanted to be accepted as American and how hopeless she’d feel to know that even today she would be seen as the “other” – no matter where she goes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaHVzdGxlLmNvL3doeS1kZWxhd2FyZS1pcy10aGUtc2V4aWVzdC1wbGFjZS1pbi1hbWVyaWNhLXRvLWluY29ycG9yYXRlLWEtY29tcGFuedIBZmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaHVzdGxlLmNvL3doeS1kZWxhd2FyZS1pcy10aGUtc2V4aWVzdC1wbGFjZS1pbi1hbWVyaWNhLXRvLWluY29ycG9yYXRlLWEtY29tcGFueT9oc19hbXA9dHJ1ZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Delaware is the sexiest place in America to incorporate a company,"Take a look at any given corporation’s registration docs and there’s a good shot you’ll see the address 1209 North Orange Street.

Spanning less than a city block in Wilmington Delaware this nondescript office building is the official incorporation address of 285k+ companies from all over the world.

On the surface there’s no reason that Delaware — home to blue hens and Civil War monuments — should be a corporate paradise. It’s the second smallest state in America and the 6th least populous with just 986k residents.

Yet nearly 1.5m businesses from all over the world are incorporated there including 68% of all Fortune 500 firms. Among them:

How did Delaware become an unlikely mecca for corporate America? And why are so many businesses parked there?

The story begins 100+ years ago in New Jersey

In the early 19th century every company had to be incorporated (legally established) in the state where they conducted business — and beholden to that state’s tax codes.

Post-Industrialization huge firms like Standard Oil and the Whiskey Trust began to consolidate fractured markets. To combat this many states set up laws aimed at regulating monopolies through heavy taxation.

But New Jersey saw an opportunity to cater to industry.

In 1891 the Garden State adopted an extremely generous corporate tax law that “would allow business to do as business pleases.” By incorporating there a company based in another state could save big on taxes and enjoy perks like unlimited market expansion.

A flood of conglomerates took up this offer and New Jersey earned so much from taxes that it was able to pay off its entire state debt.

Pressured to incentivize businesses to stay other states offered their own lenient corporate tax policies.

In this so-called “race to the bottom” Delaware emerged victorious.

Adopted in 1899 the Delaware General Corporation Law “reduced restrictions upon corporate action to a minimum” and promised to maintain the most hospitable business enclave in the nation — a place where corporations could frolic in the open fields of capitalism unencumbered by income tax bureaucratic policing and shareholder litigation.

A copy of Delaware’s Corporation Law of 1899 (Widener University Delaware Law School)

In the ensuing decades many other states (including New Jersey) reneged a bit on their corporate leniency.

But Delaware didn’t peel back.

Today the state is still the incorporation zone of choice for corporations. The climate is so favorable that even international firms seek respite there.

What exactly makes Delaware so enticing?

The Delaware loophole

Let’s say you run a tennis ball company in California that rakes in $100m/year in net income.

In California you’ll pay a state income tax (8.84% of net income) — and possibly an alternative minimum tax (6.65%) — in addition to the federal corporate tax rate of 21%.

By incorporating in Delaware though you can likely save millions in taxes with something called the “Delaware loophole.”

In Delaware intangible assets — think trademarks copyrights and leases — are free from taxation. Companies will often transfer these assets to a Delaware subsidiary and pay their own subsidiary for the rights to use said assets. This saves them money on both ends:

The company can write off these payments in its home state dramatically lowering its tax bill. The company isn’t taxed on its dealings in Delaware.

So if you pay your Delaware subsidiary — let’s call it “Tennis Ballz LLC” — $80m for the rights to use your own copyrights you could potentially cut your taxable income down from $100m to $20m saving you millions in taxes.

As any Delaware tax attorney will attest to the system is a bit more complex than this. But the process can generally be simplified as such:

The most famous real-life example of this comes courtesy of Toys “R” Us.

Twenty years ago the national chain formed a Delaware subsidiary — Geoffrey LLC — and paid the subsidiary an annual fee for the rights to use its own name and mascot. In 1990 alone these payments allowed them to skirt around $2.8m ($5.5m today) in South Carolina state taxes.

Incorporating in Delaware comes with a slew of other tax perks including:

No state corporate income tax

No sales tax

No tax on interest/other investment income

No value-added taxes

No personal property tax

No inheritance tax

Instead all a business pays is a franchise tax ($175-$180k depending on size) and small agent annual report and registration fees.

For the state of Delaware these small fees add up to as much as 41% of the state’s entire revenue. In 2019 they collectively amounted to $1.4B.

For other states the deal isn’t so sweet: It has been estimated that the Delaware loophole costs other states as much as $9.5B per year in collective lost tax revenue.

But taxes aren’t the main benefit of incorporating in Delaware: Most businesses are in it for privacy and courts.

Corporate privacy and expediency

When a company wants to incorporate in Delaware it works through a registered agent — a person in the state who acts as a middleman collecting paperwork and providing the company with a physical address.

In Delaware there are 2 huge registered agent firms:

CT Corporation (1209 Orange Street) is home to 285k+ businesses including Walmart Apple and Coca-Cola. CSC (2711 Centerville Road) houses firms like McDonald’s Amazon and Facebook.

This nondescript office building at 1209 North Orange Street in Wilmington Delaware is the address of ~300k corporations from all over the world — but none of them are actually based here. (Wikipedia)

In Delaware the incorporation process can take less than one hour to complete — and the state doesn’t require companies to disclose the names of officers and directors allowing for anonymity.

“Delaware is the state that requires the least amount of information” a business registration agent in Delaware told The New York Times in 2012. “Basically it requires none. Delaware has the most secret companies in the world and the easiest to form.”

Carl Levin a retired senator from Michigan has said that it’s easier to set up a corporation in Delaware than obtain a driver’s license.

This expediency coupled with the allure of anonymity has attracted a slew of shady enterprises to Delaware in recent years:

Viktor Bout  a Russian arms dealer once known as “the merchant of death” had nearly a dozen Delaware shell companies.

 a Russian arms dealer once known as “the merchant of death” had nearly a dozen Delaware shell companies. Tim Durham used a Delaware shell company to run a $207m Ponzi scheme on more than 5k elderly Americans.

used a Delaware shell company to run a $207m Ponzi scheme on more than 5k elderly Americans. Carl Ferrer used a Delaware shell company to house the sex trafficking website Backpage.com.

used a Delaware shell company to house the sex trafficking website Backpage.com. El Chapo used a Delaware LLC to hide cartel drug money.

Of course the vast majority of Delaware corporations and LLCs are legit enterprises. And for these firms the courts are a major draw.

A favorable court system

Delaware has what is called a Court of Chancery.

Here corporate lawsuits are resolved by the court’s judges — who specialize in corporate law — rather than juries. While the average civil trial in America can take 2-3 years to resolve Delaware’s process is far more expedient.

The judicial officers of Delaware’s Court of Chancery oversee the state’s business-related litigation (Delaware.gov)

As Priceonomics reported the Court of Chancery’s former head judge once famously said: “If you need an answer in four days you’ll get an answer in four days. [Delaware’s] Supreme Court will turn heaven and earth itself to give you an appellate answer.”

Many legal experts claim that these courts are overwhelmingly favorable to corporations — particularly when it comes to shareholder disputes.

Bigger picture

Despite its favorable climate Delaware’s status as a domestic tax haven is widely debated.

But there is no denying that the state is part of a broader trend that has seen the US shift away from financial transparency in recent decades.

According to the Tax Justice Network an advocacy group that tracks tax avoidance the US is now the second-largest tax haven in the world trailing only the Cayman Islands.

American’s so-called “wealth defense” industry — a system rife with shell companies secret cash caches and tax avoidance mechanisms — has widened the nation’s income inequality gap.

Efforts to rectify this are underway.

A new federal law passed in late 2020 banned anonymous shell companies in the US. But the full picture of how this might affect Delaware remains unclear.

The increasing demand for wireless devices such as mobile phones and computers shows the importance of wireless applications worldwide. These devices however require continuous power supply or long battery life. To limit the use of batteries for safety issues an RF energy harvesting system to provide wireless power can benefit the entire application market which is expected to grow by 22% between 2020 and 2025.

This growth can be attributed to many factors but its primary driver is artificial intelligence (AI). While AI algorithms are strong now they require more and more data in order to be more effective. And that’s where wireless power comes in. Wireless power has been proven to be reliable and efficient and it can help feed AI in order to help it make better decisions. In an interview with EE Times Europe Charlie Goetz CEO of Powercast said he believes that IoT ADAS and smart cities are a number AI-related areas that could benefit most from the implementation and adoption of wireless power.

RF is available and can be found very easily in any place and at any time regardless of time geographical limits or weather conditions. Typically RF ranges from 3 kHz to 300 GHz. The idea is to harvest those RF energy sources and store them for use in certain applications. RF energy harvesting offers significant benefits for many applications but requires careful attention to key components including the receiver antenna and power conditioning circuits needed for this approach.

Wireless power

Any industrial setting that requires sensory information for preventive maintenance and critical shutdowns can benefit from wireless power. For example a manufacturing facility has certain areas that are hard to get to or are dangerous to access. For that reason certain sensors (their batteries) cannot be changed. Sensors that are charged by wireless power allow for a set-and-forget mentality (i.e. you don’t need to change the batteries) which allows for uninterrupted information flow to the AI.

Autonomous vehicles can also greatly benefit from wireless power. Today self-driving cars integrate with their environment using sonar radar and pattern recognition. To become safer and more reliable cars need to sense their environment and communicate with the road: a street lamp the yellow lines of the road etc. via sensors. With wirelessly powered sensors cars can also communicate their way through the environment without bumping into connecting wires resulting in a more secure and dependable way.

Further down the road the enablement of smart cities will not occur with batteries and wires but with AI and wireless power. For smart cities to communicate with their environment wireless power and charging must be implemented.

Energy harvesting

Radiofrequency is an abundant source for energy harvesting although it requires the proximity of a transmitting antenna. The concept of energy harvesting from RF is not new and the process is relatively simple. Radio waves strike an antenna and cause a potential difference that moves charge carriers along the length of the antenna in an attempt to equalize the field. The harvesting circuit basically captures this movement. The energy is stored temporarily in a capacitor and then used to create a desired potential difference on the load.

RF charging technology employs several technologies (Qi PMA/AirFuel Alliance WPC etc.) each with various charging methods and maximum charging distances. Our routers as well as mobile phones create regions of space with potential energies that vary over time and/or distance. And wherever a potential difference exists there is always a way to obtain electricity.

RF transmitters for communications are typically constrained in the amount of power they can radiate. Furthermore for a given radio source the power at the receiving antenna falls off with distance as predicted by the Friis transmission equation:



where

P T = transmitted power

P R = received power

G T = transmitter antenna gain

G R = receiver antenna gain

λ = wavelength

d = distance between transmitter and receiver

The design of the receiving antenna plays a critical role in maximizing the efficiency of energy harvesting. Receiving antennas can be etched into printed circuit boards or available as receiver coil components specifically designed for the task (figure 1).

Powercast technology

In early 2021 Powercast announced that it has been named a winner of the BIG Innovation Awards 2021 presented by the Business Intelligence Group for its new wirelessly powered RFID temperature scanning system which allows companies to easily and securely monitor employee temperatures in support of Covid-19 monitoring protocols.

The temperature scanning system consists of a temperature sensor an RFID reader and a TV monitor. By using wireless technology the device charges quickly when held near an RFID reader at the entrance to the company using patented Powercast energy harvesting technology. Employees scan their forehead using the stick to read their temperature and are either allowed in or denied entry based on the reading which appears automatically on the monitor.

“The design of the antenna is very important it serves to tune us to a given frequency which in our case is 915 Mhz. When you’re dealing with RF you’re dealing with very small amounts of power at the end even at relatively close range. You’re dealing with 10 or maybe low hundreds of milliwatts. So your energy management behind that collection and conversion has to be extremely important. Antenna and energy management must work harmoniously together to get the right user experience and actually deliver real solutions” Goetz said.



Figure 2: P2110-EVAL-02 Evaluation Kit

The receiving antenna has an impedance of 50 ohms which must match the input impedance of the rest of the device. The voltage collected in the vicinity of the antenna must then be brought to a voltage where it can be converted to DC. This can be done using a charge pump which increases the voltage but obviously cannot increase the total power. Powercast offers an evaluation kit to help companies explore the possibilities of this technology. The P2110-EVAL-02 includes an RF receiver and transmitter an antenna and a charge board to collect the emitted power (figure 2).

Together with its increasing availability RF power harvesting not only benefits cabling requirements but also offers a system that is protected from environmental conditions and hazardous materials. For mesh networks engineers can combine RF energy harvesting with sophisticated device-to-device communications for a variety of applications.

From 1978 when 32.6 billion units were shipped through 2021 the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for semiconductor units is forecast to be 8.6%—an impressive 43-year annual growth rate even though the growth rate has waned for many key semiconductor applications such as PCs and cellphones. The strong CAGR also demonstrates that new market drivers continue to emerge that fuel demand for more semiconductors.

Between 2004 and 2007 semiconductor shipments broke through the 400- 500- and 600-billion unit levels before the global financial meltdown led to a steep decline in semiconductor shipments in 2008 and 2009. Unit growth rebounded sharply in 2010 with a 25% increase and surpassed 700 billion devices that year. Another strong increase in 2017 (12% growth) lifted semiconductor unit shipments beyond the 900-billion level before the one trillion mark was surpassed in 2018.

The largest annual unit growth rate across the 43-year span shown in Figure 1 was 34% in 1984 and the second-highest growth rate was 25% in 2010. In contrast the largest annual decline was 19% in 2001 following the dot-com bust. The global financial meltdown and ensuing recession caused semiconductor shipments to fall in both 2008 and 2009; the only time there have been consecutive years of unit shipment declines.",,,,,,,,,

A judge ruled earlier this year that Fieldwood could seek bankruptcy protection in the states passing part of costs for the $7.2billion total liability for hundreds of oil wells to previous owners and insurers

Apache (Nasdaq: APA) said: “ Following Fieldwood’s emergence from bankruptcy in August 2021 Apache evaluated remaining net abandonment obligations related to its legacy Gulf of Mexico properties.”

It concluded that “future net cash flows from the properties and available financial security will not be sufficient to fund all of the remaining retirement obligations”.

Apache recorded the £326million in Q3 representing excess of liability over the assets and a non-current contingent decommissioning liability of $1.2billion.

The firm therefore recorded net losses of £83m attributable to shareholders in the quarter which otherwise would have been profits of £272m.

Shell BP ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil have also held stakes in the various Fieldwood assets and have been embroiled in the dispute.

The issue of decommissioning liabilities have also played out recently in the UK where Apache had more fortune and succeeded in a legal challenge against ExxonMobil over a £100m bill.

Apache revenues totalled £1.17bn up from £835m in Q3 2020 while production totalled 388941 barrels of oil equivalent per day down 13% on 445241 boe per day in the same period last year.

In the North Sea production dropped 32% year on year to 40608 boepd from 59588 barrels as extended maintenance turnaround activity & unplanned downtime took a toll.

A production increase is expected in Q4 Apache said but October remained “constrained”.

Chief executive John Christmann said: “APA delivered another excellent quarter driven by strong US well performance continued capital and cost discipline and better-than-expected commodity prices”

The firm repurchased 14.7m shares in October and announced an increase in its annual dividend to 50 cents per share.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Most people wouldn’t pay $230 for a T-shirt or $1375 for a parka. But when the North Face Japan put a limited number of these items on the market in 2019 they quickly sold out. The reason: they were made with fiber supplied by Spiber.

The Japanese firm has invented a fermentation-derived material—which it calls Brewed Protein—that when spun into a fiber promises the strength and elasticity of silk and the softness of cashmere wool. Brewed Protein also offers consumers who are environmentally conscious a desirable feature: the material is both made from plant sources and biodegradable in soil and in water.

Spiber produces its novel material in very small quantities at a plant in Japan which explains why the North Face products were so expensive. Spiber wants to change that using the more than $640 million it has raised from investors. It just opened a larger plant in Thailand and plans an even bigger one in the US that will help make Brewed Protein more affordable. But because Spiber has failed to deliver on promises in the past some skeptics want to see more results before they declare the company a success.

Spiber was founded in 2007 by Kazuhide Sekiyama and Junichi Sugahara who were then graduate students in bioinformatics at the Institute for Advanced Biosciences part of Japan’s Keio University. Sekiyama now the firm’s CEO says he’s been fascinated with the idea of producing synthetic spider silk ever since his senior undergraduate year. He tried to derive the material from spider DNA but eventually determined that he couldn’t clone the extremely long sequence.

Spiber at a glance ▸ Founded: 2007 ▸ 2019 sales: Less than $2 million ▸ Funding: More than $640 million ▸ Employees: 235 ▸ Facilities: Tsuruoka Japan: Headquarters R&D and production of Brewed Protein (several metric tons per year); Rayong Province Thailand: Production of Brewed Protein (several hundred metric tons per year).

The company’s first several years focused on trying to industrialize the process of fermenting spider silk–like material and spinning it into a thread. In 2013 it announced the mass production of spider thread–like fiber and the construction of a bench-scale facility that produced the fiber’s raw material via bacteria-based fermentation of sugar.

Spiber caught a break in 2014 when it joined a Japanese government-sponsored research program that allowed it to perform several years of experimentation—extensive and arduous work. “We struggled a lot” Sekiyama recalls.

Eventually Spiber created a product it called Qmonos—a name that is a homonym of spiderweb in Japanese. “When we first saw Spiber’s material we were so excited because it matched our policy on performance and environmental impact” says Takao Watanabe president of Goldwin the Japanese company that has rights to produce North Face products in Japan. “We don’t use fur and wish to reduce our usage of fleece because of its environmental impact.”

It turned out though that Qmonos had issues. Notably like natural spider silk the material shrank rapidly when it absorbed water—a major problem for a material intended for making clothing.

The North Face had announced plans for a 2016 launch of a jacket called the Moon Parka made from Spiber’s fiber but it delayed the launch because of the shrinkage problem called supercontraction. “We requested Spiber to change from hydrophilic to hydrophobic without losing any material functionality” Watanabe says. It took 3 years but Spiber delivered.

The company solved the problem by studying nature Sekiyama says. Spiber researchers took a closer look at the protein in spider silk and identified the amino acids that are responsible for the supercontraction. They then changed the amino acid sequence to create a new gene that when inserted in bacteria generated a material that doesn’t shrink when wet.

“Our technology allows us to simulate in parallel changes and evolution in the natural world within a laboratory” Sekiyama says. “We make a tremendously large number of candidate molecules pick out apparently suitable ones find out the most promising DNA sequences among them and push ahead with new generations of the relevant excellent DNA.” Only Spiber has the ability to do that with structured protein at ultrahigh speed he claims.

The new material Brewed Protein is quite different from and more versatile than synthetic spider silk Sekiyama says. Consumers perceive fiber made from Spiber’s material as high end not only because of its performance and biodegradability but also because of its feel.

In blind tests conducted by third parties in Japan and the US “a majority of the participants said that Brewed Protein felt and looked better than cashmere wool” Sekiyama says. “Our DNA-design technology allows us to develop new products with more functionality and sophistication than traditional products.”

And although Brewed Protein’s initial application will be in clothing the material can also be used to produce high-performance structural foam and lightweight auto parts according to Sekiyama. Spiber plans to build facilities to serve nonfiber markets but has yet to choose a location.

Despite the technology fix Spiber isn’t out of the woods yet cautions Charles Willard an analyst at the consulting firm Lux Research. “The issue of moisture sensitivity was a fatal flaw for spider silk so it’s undeniably a good thing that Spiber is claiming to have solved this problem” he says. “However that does not mean the technology is ready for use. Spiber still needs to demonstrate the product is durable under normal wear and tear.”

Spiber isn’t ready to compete directly against more-established materials Willard adds. “The company is still at lab scale and while it claims it will be competitive with cashmere in the medium term Spiber has a long history of failing to achieve its goals” he says. “We’re skeptical of any claims it makes until it actually demonstrates volume production.”

Sekiyama acknowledges that the company has more to prove. “We sell the material in limited quantities to the North Face and others for commercialization and development of outdoor-fashion products and high-fashion products in particular” he says. “But our plant in Tsuruoka in Yamagata Prefecture can barely meet demand.”

The plant’s modest output is reflected in Spiber’s sales which were less than $2 million in 2019. The firm employs a little over 230 people two-thirds of whom work in R&D. It funds its R&D and investment in new capacity almost entirely with cash injections from investors from which it has managed to attract more than $640 million to date.

This amount includes $230 million arranged by Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities using a mechanism called value securitization. Value securitization allows firms with limited physical assets to raise funds on the basis of the potential value of their intellectual property. So far few companies in Japan have been able to attract such funds according to a Spiber spokesperson.

More sales may be on the way. The Thai plant in Rayong Province held an inauguration ceremony in March and will soon start testing production. The facility will use sugarcane as a raw material to produce several hundred metric tons of Brewed Protein per year about 100 times what the plant in Japan can make.

Goldwin’s Watanabe says he eagerly anticipates the expanded output. “When the Thai plant is fully operating we will be able to offer a broader range of products from basic products up to high-end products” he says. “Our customers are outdoors people who care a lot about issues like marine plastic so we are keen to broadly market this Brewed Protein as soon as possible. By 2025 we hope to be able to develop almost all our products with Brewed Protein.”

Spiber’s planned US facility in Clinton Iowa is the result of an alliance it formed in 2019 with the agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland. ADM has become one of Spiber’s main shareholders with a stake in the firm worth about $90 million.

The corn sugar–based plant will be designed to produce thousands of metric tons of Brewed Protein per year or about 10 times as much as the Thai facility. When the Iowa facility goes into full operation in 2023 at the earliest the cost of making Brewed Protein should be significantly lower Sekiyama says.

“Production cost will go down to $100 per kilogram—much lower than our current costs—when the Thai plant goes into full-fledged commercial operation” Sekiyama says. “When the Clinton plant enters full-capacity operations production efficiency will increase further allowing us to reduce costs to the point where Brewed Protein can take the place of wool and silk.”

Fourteen years have passed since Sekiyama produced a small quantity of synthetic spider silk in a lab. Now he faces what is perhaps his biggest challenge: making his material a viable competitor to fibers and plastics made from fossil sources.

“After we expand production capacity to tens of thousands of tons per year we’ll set our sights on replacing petroleum-derived high-performance plastics and nondegradable biobased macromolecular products” he says. That will mean producing millions of metric tons of Brewed Protein every year. And winning over a lot of skeptics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirQFodHRwczovL3BhbnRhZ3JhcGguY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY3JpbWUtY291cnRzL3dhdGNoLW5vdy1mb3JtZXItc3RhdGUtc2VuLWJpbGwtYnJhZHktaW4tbGVnYWwtZGlzcHV0ZS13aXRoLWZsb3JpZGEtbGFuZGxvcmQvYXJ0aWNsZV9jZmVkMTgyYy00MjVlLTUwYWItODJiOS04NDM3ZWY5NDI5M2QuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch now: Former state Sen. Bill Brady in legal dispute with Florida landlord,"BLOOMINGTON – Former State Sen. Bill Brady and members of his family have been in a yearlong dispute with the landlord of a Jimmy John's that his family owns in Florida because ongoing construction has “alienated” their business he said.

Brady of Bloomington and the family members were named in a recent lawsuit filed by Delray Place LLC owner of a building at 1911 S. Federal Highway in Delray Beach Florida but Brady said his family has had counter claims. Brady is a co-signer on the lease while his family members own the business.

The lawsuit filed against Brady his wife son daughter and son-in-law accuses them of owing nearly $60000 in past-due rent. Brady said they “refused” to pay rent because the landlord has “violated terms of the lease” through an ongoing construction project that has made the business less visible and accessible and at times interrupted utility services.

Florida Attorney Albert Vitto who represents Delray Place LLC and its landlord in the case had no comment for this story.

The project began in February 2020 when the property owner removed the store sign from the building and replaced it with a banner that at times has been blown away Brady said.

“(With) all the construction you couldn’t even see we had a store there” Brady said. “He (landlord) occupied all the parking spaces. There weren’t places for our employees to park let alone our customers.”

Brady said some car tires have been flattened in the parking lot from nails and other debris from the construction.

“We’re hopeful the project will be nice when it’s done but the damages done to us over the year of construction has been abusive and completely in neglect of his obligations under the lease” Brady said.

He added that they will “pay whatever we’re obligated under the courts” but thinks they’re obligated to be reimbursed for damages caused from construction.

Brady served in the Illinois Senate from 2002 to 2020 including as GOP leader. He also sought the GOP nomination for governor three times.

Gallagher (AJG) is Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates Again,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Arthur J. Gallagher (AJG) which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry.

This insurance and risk-management company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2.09%.

For the most recent quarter Arthur J. Gallagher was expected to post earnings of $1.67 per share but it reported $1.72 per share instead representing a surprise of 2.99%. For the previous quarter the consensus estimate was $1.68 per share while it actually produced $1.70 per share a surprise of 1.19%.

Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind recent estimates have been moving higher for Arthur J. Gallagher. In fact the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive which is a great sign of an earnings beat especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Arthur J. Gallagher currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.11% which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on January 26 2023.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Air Caraïbes et French Bee réclament des aides d'Etat pour être à égalité avec leurs concurrentes

Paris France | AFP | samedi 10/04/2021 - Air Caraïbes et French Bee les deux compagnies aériennes du groupe Dubreuil demandent de l'aide à l'Etat assurant être les seules de leur secteur à ne pas avoir encore obtenu de soutien public face à la crise du virus.



""Nous demandons à l'Etat d'être aidés parce que nous avons subi quelque chose d'exceptionnel et parce que nous subissons les conséquences de mesures qu'il a prises"" a déclaré Marc Rochet vice-président d'Air Caraïbes et président de French Bee dans une interview publiée samedi sur le site de La Tribune.



Depuis le déclenchement de la crise sanitaire voici plus d'un an la France a considérablement limité les voyages depuis et vers l'étranger. L'aéroport d'Orly notamment a été fermé pendant trois mois en 2020.



Ces mesures ont plombé le secteur aérien et M. Rochet estime que ses compagnies ont perdu ""plusieurs années de bénéfice"".



Il prévoit un retour dans le vert pour 2022 mais justifie sa demande d'aides publiques par le fait que tous ses concurrents en ont reçues à commencer par le géant Air France.



""Quand on fait un geste pour Air France Air Austral ou Corsair il faut que ce soit à peu près la même chose pour tout le monde"" a estimé M. Rochet sans dire combien ses compagnies avaient demandé à l'Etat.



Il s'est prononcé pour une indemnisation commune à tout son secteur prenant l'exemple des remontées mécaniques.



M. Rochet a indiqué par ailleurs que Dubreuil n'était pas pressé de chercher un nouveau candidat auquel ouvrir son capital après l'échec d'une alliance avec l'armateur CMA-CGM en début d'année.



""Ce n'est pas la priorité"" a-t-il déclaré précisant que des discussions se poursuivaient avec CMA-CGM pour de simples accords sans être pour autant ""intense(s)"".

Check out those titillating invoices at the Trump hush money trial.,"Jurors did see Trump’s Sharpie-crafted signature on several $35000 checks that were drawn from Trump’s personal bank account and sent to Michael Cohen in 2017. Prosecutors hope jurors will conclude that Trump was personally involved in Cohen’s arrangement of hush money to keep porn star Stormy Daniels quiet about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump.

But the salacious details were entirely absent Monday as attorneys grilled a former Trump Organization financial controller and a current bookkeeper about “accounts payable” and the nuts and bolts of how money moved through the massive company. In many of the instances at issue in the case these witnesses said the money ultimately moved at the direction of Trump himself.

The sense of abrupt deceleration stemmed in part from sky-high expectations for an explosive confrontation between Trump and Cohen or live testimony from one or both of Trump’s alleged paramours who figure in the case: Daniels and Karen McDougal a former Playboy Playmate who got a payout from Trump allies at the National Enquirer.

For court watchers hoping for that level of drama they’ll need to wait at least another day — or possibly much longer. Prosecutors revealed on Monday afternoon that they still have about two weeks’ worth of witnesses to go.

Defense attorneys meanwhile appeared to revel in the prosecution’s responsibility for the tedium and mercifully offered up only cursory cross-examination of both witnesses: former controller Jeffrey McConney and accounts payable clerk Deborah Tarasoff. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche’s questioning of Tarasoff took only five minutes.

“The checks that we just went through for the past hour and a half…” Blanche said as he opened one of his few questions to Tarasoff who’s worked for Trump for 24 years and gave Trump’s son Eric Trump a smile and a pat on the leg as she returned to the courtroom after a break.

As prosecutors plodded through the documents Monday they did draw out some subtext and nuances suggesting to jurors that there was an unusual air of secrecy and irregularity around the payments to Cohen. The documents associated with those payments — including the checks that prosecutors laboriously displayed — are the very business records that Trump is accused of falsifying in violation of a New York law on corporate fraud.

McConney testified that he was instructed to make the payments to Cohen at a brief meeting in 2016 with Trump’s then-CFO Allen Weisselberg. The controller said that while the payments were recorded as legal expenses pursuant to a “retainer agreement” they did not go through the Trump Organization’s legal department as such payments typically did.

Emails suggested Cohen was slow to understand that Trump’s accountants wanted invoices to support the monthly $35000 payments Cohen received.

“A lot of people ask for money. I need an invoice” McConney explained matter of factly.

When McConney reiterated that requirement to Cohen Cohen offered a somewhat puzzling reply: “Jeff Please remind me of the monthly amount.”

Cohen also at first simply typed in a few lines under the word “Invoice” in an email. He later sent monthly invoices to Weisselberg — but often curiously continued to omit the amount.

In later testimony Tarasoff said she checked with McConney and Weisselberg on those invoices and confirmed that Cohen was due $35000 each month.

Prosecutors’ suggestion of subterfuge and irregularity around the payments could be harnessed later to suggest Donald Trump’s consciousness of guilt on a key element in elevating the business-records charges from misdemeanors to felonies: that he knew the hush money payment to Daniels was legally required to be reported as a campaign contribution and that he conspired with others to hide it.

Trump’s attorneys disputed that there was any unusual secrecy around the payments and have suggested that any discretion around the matter was to protect Trump’s wife Melania and other members of his family not to influence the 2016 presidential election or to circumvent the more esoteric and debatable aspects of campaign finance law.

While prosecutors have seized on the categorization of the payments as “legal expenses” in Trump Organization bookkeeping records as a flagrant falsehood McConney said under cross-examination that label was simply one of a limited number of choices in “a drop-down menu” in the dated computer system used by Trump’s finance personnel.

“These categories: There was a level of rigidity to them right? … If you’re talking about payment to an attorney legal expenses was the account that was used” Trump lawyer Emil Bove asked McConney who readily agreed.

And while the prosecution made much of McConney keeping his notes about the structure of the payments to Cohen in a locked drawer the controller said that was standard practice for most of what he had in his office since it contained information on employee payroll and bonuses.

“I had a lot of sensitive information” McConney said.

While few reporters were seen gripping the courtroom’s wooden armrests Monday the hush money trial has featured an unusual dose of suspense for journalists — and for Trump’s defense attorneys. That’s because prosecutors have been unusually guarded about their schedule for the witnesses they plan to call each day.

The judge Juan Merchan has refused to order that sort of routine disclosure citing Trump’s public comments about witnesses and his repeated violations of the judge’s gag order.

Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said Monday that the prosecution has been voluntarily telling Trump’s attorneys “the day before” about whom the government plans to call the following day. “We did not want to have the next witnesses’ names out there” Steinglass said.

The most attention-grabbing developments of the day — the judge’s renewed threat to throw Trump in jail if he again violates the gag order and Trump’s defiant statement at day’s end that he’d proudly become a political prisoner if necessary — both took place out of earshot of the jury.

Most members of the jury remained attentive through the long slog Monday but one seemed visibly bored by the repetitive testimony. During the morning session he stared out into the gallery largely filled with reporters. By the afternoon he was resting his head in his hands as the documents popped up on small video monitors in front of the jurors and oversize ones mounted on the walls of the courtroom.

As his life and study in New York City were put on pause during the pandemic Shuli returned to his hometown Wenzhou China. He bought a Super 8 mm camera and started filming his loved ones without a precise intention.

Back home with his parents Shuli found himself confronted by the past and lingering tensions with his mother. As his need to discuss his truth became overwhelming Shuli turned the camera on himself and his family.

The distanced gaze of the lens seemed to provide the courage and justification he needed to have the difficult conversations with his mother that he’d been putting off. The making of the film which Shuli titled “Will You Look at Me” offered a way for mother and son who love each other but struggle to set aside personal and cultural expectations to see each other.

CHICAGO (AP) — Police cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at the University of Chicago on Tuesday as tension ratcheted up in standoffs with demonstrators at other college campuses around the U.S. — and increasingly in Europe.

Nearly three weeks into a movement launched by a protest at Columbia University the Rhode Island School of Design held talks with protesters occupying a building and MIT dealt with a new encampment on a site that was cleared but immediately retaken by demonstrators.

The confrontations come as campuses try a range of strategies from appeasement to threats of disciplinary action to resolve the protests against the Israel-Hamas war and clear the way for commencements.

At the University of Chicago protesters numbering in the several hundreds had gathered in an area known as the Quad for at least eight days. Campus administrators warned them Friday to leave the area or face removal.

Police in riot gear blocked access to the Quad early Tuesday as law enforcement dismantled the encampment. Officers picked up a barricade and moved it toward protesters some of whom chanted “Up up with liberation Down down with occupation!” Police and protesters pushed back and forth along the barricade as the officers moved to reestablish control.

At MIT protesters were given a Monday afternoon deadline to voluntarily leave or face suspension. Many left according to an MIT spokesperson who said protesters breached fencing after the arrival of demonstrators from outside the university. On Monday night dozens of protesters remained at the encampment in a calmer atmosphere listening to speakers and chanting before taking a pizza break.

Sam Ihns a graduate student at MIT studying mechanical engineering and a member of MIT Jews for a Ceasefire said that the group has been at the encampment for two weeks and that they were calling for an end to the killing in Gaza.

“Specifically our encampment is protesting MIT’s direct research ties to the Israeli Ministry of Defense” he said.

No arrests had been made as of Monday night according to the MIT spokesperson.

At the Rhode Island School of Design where students started occupying a building Monday a spokesperson said that the school affirms students’ rights to freedom of speech and peaceful assembly and that it supports all members of its community. The RISD president and provost were on site meeting with the demonstrators the spokesperson said.

The student protests have spread to Europe where they are gaining momentum. Police arrested about 125 activists Tuesday as they broke up a camp at the University of Amsterdam and German police dismantled an occupation at Berlin’s Free University. Students also have held protests or set up encampments in Finland Denmark Italy Spain France and Britain.

Many protesters want their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort. Others simply want to call attention to the deaths in Gaza and for the war to end.

Demonstrations at New York City's Columbia University where the protest movement began about three weeks ago have roiled its campus. Officials on Monday canceled its large main ceremony but said students will be able to celebrate at a series of smaller school-based ceremonies this week and next.

Columbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia’s green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks.

Similar encampments sprouted up elsewhere leading universities to struggle with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.

The University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony. Students abandoned their camp at USC on Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest. Other universities have held graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday.

A group of faculty and staff members at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill asked the administration for amnesty for student protesters who were recently arrested and suspended.

Harvard University’s interim president Alan Garber warned students that those in an encampment in Harvard Yard could face “involuntary leave"" meaning they would not be allowed on campus could lose their student housing and might not be able to take exams.

At the University of California San Diego police cleared an encampment and arrested more than 64 people including 40 students. The University of California Los Angeles moved classes online for the week due to disruptions following the dismantling of an encampment last week that resulted in 44 reported arrests.

Vowing to destroy Hamas Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34500 Palestinians about two-thirds of them women and children according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.

Hamas on Monday announced its acceptance of an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal but Israel said the deal did not meet its “core demands” and that it was pushing ahead with an assault on the southern Gaza town of Rafah.

“Cease-fires are temporary” said Selina Al-Shihabi a Georgetown University sophomore who was taking part in a protest at George Washington. “There can be a cease-fire but the U.S. government will continue to arm the Israeli military. We plan to be here until the university divests or until they drag us out of here.”

This article contains information about Autodesk software subscription offerings and how they pertain to US Government specific needs. We’ll discusses the various offerings how and when an offering is best used and high-level technical details about each type of subscription offering; more specifically we’ll address the following:

Selecting the right subscription type

Migration strategies and options

Technical requirements for each option

This article does not attempt to define or override Government regulations agency security parameters or security policies. The purpose is to show how Autodesk subscription can best be used in an enterprise Government environment.

Subscription Overview

Basic Concepts

Autodesk subscription is a term-based licensing mechanism that allows a user to operate the software for a given period of time. Subscription has many benefits over the perpetual maintenance licensing model used in the past. Some of these benefits include access from multiple computers lower overall cost of usage and improved support options.

In the past licensing for Autodesk software required the software to be locked to a computer (i.e. node-locked) or shared using a network implementation. Connectivity was required to activate the software and lock it to a given computer. If the computer was altered in some way the activation would need to be performed again. There were also limits on the number of activations possible. Subscription eliminates this model.

Subscription Types

Subscription is available for two primary types of implementations: single user and multiple users. There is an alternative option exclusively for the US Government called Local Licensing. It is intended for a single computer and functions much like the legacy node-locked standalone license.

Single-User Subscription

Single-user subscription is a subscription assigned to a single person called a named user. The named user can access the software from more than one computer.

Single-user subscription is not the same as ‘standalone’ a name used in the past to signify a node-locked license on a single computer. In the old standalone model only one computer could use the software with a single license.

Single-user subscription requires the user to sign in using their credentials. Once signed in the user is free to use the software. When multiple seats are purchased the organization software administrator can determine which users can access a given software package. This can be changed at any time by the administrator. This allows the administrator to assign software to users in the organization and reassign the software as needed. The tools used for managing the users are provided via a web browser over the Internet using the Autodesk software management portal.

Single-user subscription works best for Internet-connected systems. Plans are available that offer tools for managing larger groups and with extended reporting and support options.

Multi-User Subscription

Multi-user subscription is used to serve larger groups of users. A subscription license is consumed for the software when and only when it is in use. This allows the organization to share the subscription across many users simultaneously and in an automated manner. Users do not need to be named and signing in is not required.

Another key difference between single-user and multi-user subscription is that no connectivity is required with Autodesk for multi-user subscriptions. The subscription licenses are hosted within the organization’s network domain. Access can be determined by configuring the service to allow for any number of possible access permutations.

Multi-user subscription is also known as concurrent licensing. Because the license is only in use while the software is in use the same license can be used concurrently throughout an organization. If a user is not using the software the license is available for another user. This is a great way to maximize an organization’s software budget.

Users can also ‘check out’ the license for extended periods of time. This allows the user to ‘borrow’ a license for field use when away from the organization’s network.

License services within the organization are not limited. They can be hosted on multiple networks inside SCIFs or in small work groups.

Multi-user works best for larger environments and user-bases. The more users the organization has the more the concurrent manner of licensing benefits the organization.

Local Licensing

Local licensing is a US Government alternative that uses the multi-user subscription mechanism to simulate a standalone node-locked license. The license service is hosted on the same computer as the software rather than being shared centrally on a network. The subscription license becomes locked to the computer. The user does not need to sign in to Autodesk to use the software nor do they need to connect to their organization’s network. This option is ideal for truly standalone offline computers which may have no connectivity at all.

Local Licensing works best for single users in disconnected isolated or high availability situations.

Technical Requirements

Single-User Subscription

The connectivity required to access subscription rights is done over the Internet. This should not be confused with cloud computing. No data is transferred other than the credentials necessary to authenticate the user and provide access to the software. The communication uses standard HTTP and HTTPS protocols and ports.

Single-user subscription requires an account for each named user. This account is created and maintained using the Autodesk management portal. The organization’s software administrator can create these accounts or the user themselves may do so. The software administrator must assign rights to the named user for the user to be able to use the organization’s software subscriptions. A single user may also acquire a subscription for themselves in which case they are the administrator and have complete access to their own subscription.

View the complete list of ports protocols domains and payload content.

The user must connect to Autodesk at least once every 30 days to maintain usage access when using single-user subscription. Extended offline plans are available that can remain disconnected from the Internet for up to 365 days (1-year plan) or 1095 days (3-year plan).

The software will attempt to contact Autodesk to validate the subscription access each time it is connected to the Internet with both standard and extended offline subscriptions. Usage information that is collected is stored on the computer until it reconnects. Once uploaded the reporting statistics becomes available for the user through the management interface.

Different named user subscription plans offer varying levels of support and reporting options.

Multi-User Subscription

Multi-user subscription requires a computer to host the licenses for the users in the organization’s domain. The hosting computer can run a desktop operating system (OS) or a server OS. The primary reason to use a server OS is to enable more simultaneous network connections. For example Windows desktop OS only allows a maximum of 10 concurrent network connections. Unless the licenses are intended for a small workgroup of five to six individuals a server OS should always be considered required.

The license server is a lightweight service that typically runs on Windows platforms. This service operates on two to five TCP ports which can be defined by the server administrator. The default ports are 27000 for the listener and 2080 for the Autodesk daemon. The actual size of the license service application is less than 7MB. Communication traffic is similarly very light at a few bytes per request. Once a request is served the ‘stay-alive’ heartbeats typically occur about once every three to five minutes. They are usually about 1-2 bytes long. The heartbeats are used to determine if a user is idle or disconnected. This enables the server to reclaim licenses that are not in use.

Access is controlled by a configuration file placed on the server. There are dozens of configuration options which can control access to the software the ability to borrow licenses idle timeouts and more. These configuration options can be defined as global per user per machine or for a given network.

The configuration file is a simple text file. It can be updated at any time and commands can be issued to the license service to refresh the configuration while running. This allows other services such as Active Directory to write to the configuration file in an automated manner. By automating the interface between LDAP services and the license server adding and removing access can be greatly simplified.

Local Licensing

Local licensing is a preconfigured variation of multi-user subscription that is intended for one computer. A local license uses a text file (the license) in the same manner a multi-user license server would. The primary difference is that the license is not shared with other uses and therefore requires no network connectivity or open ports on the host.

Installing Local Licensing

Local licensing is installed by downloading and using the dedicated installer.

After installation a program is used to install and update license files. The program validates the license to ensure it is valid and correct for the computer it is being installed on. After license installation the user need only reboot the computer for the license to take effect. After the reboot the user starts the application and selects ‘Network’ or ‘Multi-User’ as the license type. From that point forward the application will start normally with no further interactions required.

Network Isolation

No firewall ports need to be opened for local licensing. Technically no communication is occurring at the network layer. The license service is configured to loop back to itself on the bequeath ‘localhost’ (127.0.0.1 or ::1) adapter address. Internally the service is using the same default ports for communication as a standard multi-user implementation (TCP 27000 and 2080). External to the client however these listening ports are not available. When no application is in use the only active port will be 127.0.0.1:27000.

Disabling all network activity and licensing services is also possible with Local Licensing. To do so install the Local License Manager then the license reboot and run the application (i.e. AutoCAD). Borrow the license from the license service and then stop and disable the license service (Autodesk Local Licensing). The user can then use the application for up to six months without the license service running. After six months they need to start the service borrow the license again and then stop the service for another six months.

The physical port is not necessary for the local licensing model but the onboard adapter must be enabled and addressable in order to perform the actions necessary for local licensing to work. The network adapter can be disabled after borrowing a license. Once borrowed the adapter does not need to be enabled again until the license needs to be refreshed or the borrow window expires.

Updating Local Licenses

Updating the license is as simple as running the license utility to install the new license. A reboot will be necessary for the new license to become loaded and available.

Migration Strategy

If moving from maintenance to subscription the user base must be migrated from one license type to the other. Fortunately this is relatively simple. The method of switching users from maintenance to subscription varies by product version. The switch can be performed manually or through automated processes.

Migrating 2019-2016 Releases

Licenses can be switched to subscription without re-installing the software. To reset the license type a set of files must be deleted. Using Windows Explorer navigate to the C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\CLM\LGS

Within this folder there may be several subfolders depending on which product is installed. The names of the folders follow the syntax [product code]_[release].0.0.F. To determine a product code for a given product use the Autodesk Knowledge Base to query the product keys for the release year. In the example above the first directory (498Ji…) pertains to Mudbox 2018.

To reset the licensing for a product delete these two files: LGS.data and nw.cfg

Alternatively a simple change to the content of LGS.data can reflect the license type desired. The possible values are:

Standalone maintenance licensing: _STANDALONE

Single-user subscription: _USER

Multi-user subscription or Network Maintenance: _NETWORK

Switching from Single-User or Standalone to Multi-User

If switching from Standalone or Single-user to Multi-user an environment variable must be added to direct the client to the license server(s). The environment variable is named FLEXLM_LICENSE_FILE and contains the values of the license servers for the client to use. For example here is an entry for two servers:

@license_server_A.mydomain.gov;@license_server_B.mydomain.gov

This example directs the client to request a license from license_server_A then license_server_B. The list of servers can be unique to each client or the same. The number of entries defines the number of license servers available. There are no limits to the number of servers however 2-3 are typical for most organizations. The order can be used to load balance the servers.

Migrating 2020+ Releases

Starting with 2020 releases a command line utility is used to change the license type for a product. On Windows the utility is found here:

%CommonProgramFiles(x86)%\Autodesk Shared\AdskLicensing\Current\helper

The utility name is called AdskLicensingInstHelper. Get details related to the license utility.

Like the previous file-based examples the utility can be used to edit the license platform or reset it. For example issuing the following command will change the license type for AutoCAD 2020 from maintenance to single-user subscription:

AdskLicensingInstHelper change -pk 001L1 -pv 2020.0.0.F -lm USER

The tool can also be used to change to multi-user and set the license environment simultaneously. This mitigates the need to manually edit the aforementioned environment variable.

To meet its database and automatic scaling requirements Cando reached out to Onica a Rackspace Technology company an AWS Premier Consulting Partner for assistance. “Onica had the AWS expertise we sought and they are a Canadian company which matters to us” Banks says. “I was also impressed by how they structure their support services.” Cando worked with Onica to adopt a serverless solution deviating from the existing multi-account AWS approach to increase scalability and lower costs through automation and optimization. The new solution takes advantage of AWS serverless services such as AWS Lambda and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS).



In addition Cando implemented continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) best practices for software development and deployment. Cando is also enhancing the security of its environment by consolidating different monitoring applications and using AWS services such as AWS Certificate Manager to provision and manage Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. “By following AWS architectural best practices for security along with our own internal security processes we are in a better position in terms of protecting our applications and data” says Banks.



Processing Millions of Data Points Daily Helping Rail Customers Improve Visibility

Using its AWS serverless solution Cando can more easily and quickly scale its Quasar application environment to aggregate and process millions of data points every day. As a result Cando can support its customers’ increasingly large data volumes while improving visibility. “AWS helps us grow our Quasar environment and integrate all the IoT data coming from different sources and then create a rich data set for our customers” says Banks. “Using this data customers can identify opportunities for optimization and visibility into their supply chains.”



Deploying Applications in Days Rather Than Months

Thanks to AWS and Onica Cando has accelerated its application deployment time by moving to a serverless model and adopting a CI/CD approach. Leveraging infrastructure-as-code and automation Cando developers can roll out new Quasar features and enhancements to customers faster than before. “We can spin up new resources in minutes by reusing the existing serverless infrastructure components and our developers can push out new application features in a few days rather than the weeks or months it might take previously” says Banks. “From a business perspective that saves us a lot of time and makes us incredibly responsive to our customers.”



Cutting Operational Costs

By relying on its serverless infrastructure Cando is also seeing operational cost savings. “Using AWS we don’t have to prepay for compute and storage which is a huge benefit” says Banks. “Also we spend a lot less money on development and rebuilding the same tools over and over.” By lowering operational costs the company is now poised to acquire multiple larger rail shipper customers in the future. Cando is currently exploring additional AWS technologies to facilitate automation and cost optimization. “We know we will find new AWS services we can trust to do what we need” says Banks. “I have confidence that AWS will continue to help us move the business forward while reducing costs and enabling innovation.”



Cando recently developed Quasar a platform for supply chain optimization that is powered by the Internet of Things (IoT) and runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Using its AWS serverless solution Cando can more easily and quickly scale its Quasar application environment to aggregate and process millions of data points every day.

In this format data is arranged in the form of rows and columns.

Let’s see some common problems faced with tabular data and how to solve them.

🔢 Handling Numerical Data

Let's create a synthetic dataset using the sklearn.datasets module having 10000 rows and 25 features.

Scaling Standardizing and Normalizing

When training linear models such as Linear/Logistic Regression and SVM scaling your dataset can have a huge impact on model performance.

Because these models are optimized using distance metrics scaling ensures that features having larger values do not dominate the outcome of the model fit.

In our first method of scaling we will use the MinMaxScaler provided by sklearn to scale each feature to be between the values -1 and 1.

Contents of X_df

The MinMaxScaler accepts a parameter called feature_range where the user can specify the desired range. It’s considered a best practice to keep the ranges to be either -1 to 1 or 0 to 1 depending on whether your feature has positive values or not.

Under the hood this is what is being calculated:

where the difference of an element in a feature and the min value of the feature is divided by the range of the feature.

Another form of scaling is called standardization where every feature is transformed to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. This is very useful in order to normally distribute our features.

The StandardScaler module can be used to standardize our features:

Contents of X_df_standardized

Standardization works as follows:

where each individual element of a feature is subtracted by the mean of the feature set and divided by the standard deviation.

So far we have looked at scaling methods that operate at a feature level. Methods such as unit length normalization enable scaling across observations as well.

This type of normalization is useful when the data has a lot of equivalent features such as text data because each word is treated as a feature.

The Normalizer scales every observation to have a unit norm length of 1.

Contents of X_df_normalized

Here is the formula for normalization:

The denominator is the l2 norm of the observation which is the square root of the sum of squares of the observation’s value in each feature.

Creating Polynomial Features

Polynomial features might be needed in two situations:

When you suspect that features have a non-linear relationship with the target variable When you suspect that features are dependent on one another (interaction).

(10000 350)

We can clearly see that our initial data which had only 25 features now has 350! 😮

Note: Building polynomial features will lead to feature explosion so be sure to use good feature selection practices.

Transform Features

Scikit Learn also makes it very easy to create custom transformers to apply to one or more features. All you have to do is define a function and pass it to an instance of the FunctionTransformer .

If you are working with Pandas Dataframes instead of using FunctionTransformer you can use the .apply method available with the data frame to transform your data.

Binning

Binning is a method used to treat numerical variables like categorical ones. Binning involves breaking up our numerical data into discrete bins.

Numpy has a method called .digitize which helps create bins with ease:

If you are working with DataFrames you can also use the .cut method provided by Pandas to create bins:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc2NoLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzLzEwLXllYXJzLWluZHVzdHJ5LTQtMC1hdC1ib3NjaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ten years of Industry 4.0,"It’s been a decade since we officially welcomed you to the company. But that was just a formality as you had already been an idea for a long time. We had a vision of smart factories with machines that are connected and communicate with each other — and people at the center of it all orchestrating production. In 2011 we finally gave you an official name: Industry 4.0 — the fourth industrial revolution. In giving you this name we also called upon industry science and politics to lay out a path for you. A path toward the factory of the future — one in which people and machines work together as the best kind of team manufacturing products in a way that is transparent efficient and conserves resources. A factory where the only things that are static and fixed will be the floors walls and ceilings; everything else will be variable and flexible.

You have not remained merely a vision of the future but have become a global market worth billions. German companies alone invest more than two billion euros in you each year. And that figure is rising rapidly.

And what about the two of us? We have developed into a single unit an inseparable team. People and machines have become colleagues.

Not only do you have to worry about it possibly draining your battery while you’re away from home but it can also rack up data charges well beyond your monthly budget. Why is your phone using data when you’re not on it?

Your phone uses data when you’re not on it because you may have an app running in the background that’s either updating (or syncing) or receiving data-draining notifications like news or weather updates. To prevent this you can disable background data or delete the worst offenders!

When mobile data is toggled on and the phone isn’t in your hand some background apps might be draining your data without your knowledge. But do you know why this is happening? Let’s discuss some of the worst culprits!

The Cost of Mobile Data on Your Cell Phone

The Cost of Mobile Data on Your Cell Phone

Data plan costs are not affordable for everyone and Mobile Data use is expensive. On your Cell Phone many mobile data plans are advertised as “unlimited” but most also have a data speed reduction point when your data stream is going to slow significantly.

We did not start paying for “Mobile Data” or “Mobile Broadband” until the first Wireless Internet access became available in 1991.

Today on your average Smartphone bill 80% percent of the bill goes towards data. As you can see in the example above out of an approximately $50.00 per month phone bill $39.00 is for data.

Automatic App Updates

Automatic App Updates

Updating apps is great because you can get new features as they roll out making it easier and more fun to use the App. However the updates may use up much of your mobile data especially if it’s a completely new version. Consider updating apps over Wi-Fi instead of your cellular connection to save on your mobile data.

You can change this feature on your phone by clicking on the settings and ensuring the ‘Auto-update apps’ option is set to ‘Wi-Fi only.’ Or you can manually install these updates as they come out.

Please see some of our other interesting Data articles like “Why Is My Data Running Out So Fast?” and “How to Lower Your Home WiFi Data Usage.”

Auto-Syncing of Data in Apps

Why is my phone using data when I’m not on it video.

Automatic syncing of data is a fantastic feature for staying up-to-date but it comes at a high cost if you’re not using Wi-Fi. Your app may be auto-refreshing in the background even if you haven’t used it in days or weeks!

Some app settings give the option to choose when it syncs. The best solution is to disable the automatic syncing or switch it to manual. This way the app will not be running in the background as much and eating into your mobile data while you’re not using it.

Many Apps come preset with this feature on so it is important to check that setting when downloading a new App.

Turn Off Auto Syncing on Twitter and Facebook

Turn Off Auto Syncing on Twitter and Facebook

For some apps like Twitter turning the Auto Syncing feature off is easy. Simply click on the ‘Data usage’ section and uncheck the “sync data” switch. This feature makes the app synchronize its data only when you’re using it.

Facebook on the other hand doesn’t have an obvious way to disable this background activity. Therefore you should take control at the system level. Head to the apps section of your systems setting and tap on the Facebook app or whichever app is in question.

Click on data usage or mobile data and Wi-Fi and deactivate the toggle next to background data. This action prevents the app from using data in the background unless connected to a Wi-Fi network. It is important to state that by doing this your ability to receive notifications won’t be affected since that is controlled separately in the notifications tab.

Downloading Music Compared to Streaming to Save Data

Downloading music compared to streaming will be a better alternative if you are looking to save on data usage. That’s because you can listen to music over and over again when you’re not on your phone. You can also enjoy the privilege of listening to the song or mixtape as many times as you wish without incurring an extra cost.

Another reason is if you’re traveling in remote areas or use up all of your data allowance on your plan you’ll want your favorite music available to listen to offline. Android and iOS Applications like iTunes SoundCloud Amazon Music are examples of great music downloaders.

Many of these Apps are familiar and crossover between downloading and streaming. Streaming music from an online platform like Spotify Tidal or YouTube Music will need to be supported and if you are not connected to a Wi-Fi network it will quickly drain your data.

Turn Off Auto-Playing Videos to Save Data

Turn Off Auto-Playing Videos to Save Data

Videos consume a lot of data. Some social media apps love to auto-play the videos when you aren’t paying attention and when your cellular data is on. For an app like Facebook you can change this sneaky feature.

Click on the app’s menu tap on settings and privacy and scroll to data saver. There you will find a toggle that can reduce the quality of the auto-downloaded image and stop videos from playing on their own. For other apps the solution is quite similar.

YouTube also runs videos on Auto-Play. If you want to turn YouTube Autoplay off go to the watch screen of any video. At the top of the YouTube video player tap the Autoplay toggle to set it to off.

Enabling Background Data on Various Apps

Weather social and news apps top the list when it comes to chewing through unnecessary data. That’s because they often check-in at regular intervals throughout the day to pull in new updates which is great if you like to be in the know.

For example when you look at the Google weather alerts feature it can be helpful. Not everyone’s the same and certainly not living in the same weather conditions. Also not everyone wants to receive these frequent weather alerts to become constant with each passing storm.

Depending on your circumstances and needs you can stop these data users by disabling this feature altogether. Below is how to change your Google notifications.

How to Change your Google notifications. Turn notifications on or off On your Android phone or tablet open the Google app. Tap More Settings Notifications. Notifications. Decide which notifications you want to turn on or off: All: At the top turn Show notifications on or off. One or more: Next to a topic turn the notification on or off.



Leaving Mobile Data On When You Are Not Using It

Leaving Mobile Data On When You Are Not Using It

Most of all ensure you disable your mobile data when you are not using the internet or your phone. Even when your mobile data is switched off you can still make and receive calls as well as send and receive text messages. Whenever you find the need to use the internet you can always switch it back on.

You may turn off most background activities app by app delete apps that use background data switch off automatic updates and still not find the root cause of the problem.

Turning off your mobile data when not in use can be a temporary solution before you learn what’s eating through it.

Other Ways To Reduce Mobile Data Usage

Figure Out Which Apps Are Preying on Your Data

The first step in fixing a problem is to diagnose it correctly. This scenario is no different even if it comes to your Smartphone. If the mobile data usage is high figure out which apps are the culprits and act accordingly because some apps can connect to cellular data even when shut.

“How do I do this?” you may ask. Regardless of the type of phone you have whether iOS or Android the answer is quite simple.

iPhone – For an iPhone go to the settings app click on the Cellular section and you will be able to see a detailed readout of how much data you’ve used in the current billing period. You will also learn how much data each app has used lately.

Android – The same information is available on the Network and Internet area on the settings app for Android. However the exact location depends on the Android phone’s manufacturer.

Once you figure out which apps these are you may consider uninstalling them if you can survive without them or disable the app if they were pre-downloaded.

Turn Data Saver Mode On

When you turn on data saver mode your phone will restrict the use of cellular data. You can also choose the apps you want to continue using background data if you check them regularly. This process goes a long way in saving yourself from unpleasant surprises on your monthly mobile bill.

How to turn on Low Data Mode for an iPhone Go to Settings and tap Cellular. Tap Cellular Data Options then turn on Low Data Mode.



How to turn on Data Saver Mode for a Google Pixel Turn Data Saver on or off Open your phone’s Settings app. Tap Network & internet. Data Saver. Turn Data Saver on or off. In your status bar when Data Saver is on you’ll see the Data Saver icon. You’ll also see a notification at the top of your phone’s Settings app.



How to turn on Data Saver Mode in Android 8.0 or Later Go to Settings Go to Network & Internet then Data usage. Select Data Saver. Toggle Use Data Saver on.



Android – On your settings app tap Network and Internet then tap on data saver and switch it on. When the data saver switch is toggled to the on position you’ll see the data saver icon and a notification at the top of your phone’s settings app.

Conclusion

Data costs down the drain

Although it may be difficult to find out the actual reason why your data is slowly being drained from your Smartphone when you’re not using it there’s usually a quick fix. The best trick is learning the ins and outs of your phone and “outsmarting” these apps. Read app reviews before installing them (users are critical about high data use) and connect to a Wi-Fi network whenever you can!

Spanning less than a city block in Wilmington Delaware this nondescript office building is the official incorporation address of 285k+ companies from all over the world.

On the surface there’s no reason that Delaware — home to blue hens and Civil War monuments — should be a corporate paradise. It’s the second smallest state in America and the 6th least populous with just 986k residents.

Yet nearly 1.5m businesses from all over the world are incorporated there including 68% of all Fortune 500 firms. Among them:

How did Delaware become an unlikely mecca for corporate America? And why are so many businesses parked there?

The story begins 100+ years ago in New Jersey

In the early 19th century every company had to be incorporated (legally established) in the state where they conducted business — and beholden to that state’s tax codes.

Post-Industrialization huge firms like Standard Oil and the Whiskey Trust began to consolidate fractured markets. To combat this many states set up laws aimed at regulating monopolies through heavy taxation.

But New Jersey saw an opportunity to cater to industry.

In 1891 the Garden State adopted an extremely generous corporate tax law that “would allow business to do as business pleases.” By incorporating there a company based in another state could save big on taxes and enjoy perks like unlimited market expansion.

A flood of conglomerates took up this offer and New Jersey earned so much from taxes that it was able to pay off its entire state debt.

Pressured to incentivize businesses to stay other states offered their own lenient corporate tax policies.

In this so-called “race to the bottom” Delaware emerged victorious.

Adopted in 1899 the Delaware General Corporation Law “reduced restrictions upon corporate action to a minimum” and promised to maintain the most hospitable business enclave in the nation — a place where corporations could frolic in the open fields of capitalism unencumbered by income tax bureaucratic policing and shareholder litigation.

A copy of Delaware’s Corporation Law of 1899 (Widener University Delaware Law School)

In the ensuing decades many other states (including New Jersey) reneged a bit on their corporate leniency.

But Delaware didn’t peel back.

Today the state is still the incorporation zone of choice for corporations. The climate is so favorable that even international firms seek respite there.

What exactly makes Delaware so enticing?

The Delaware loophole

Let’s say you run a tennis ball company in California that rakes in $100m/year in net income.

In California you’ll pay a state income tax (8.84% of net income) — and possibly an alternative minimum tax (6.65%) — in addition to the federal corporate tax rate of 21%.

By incorporating in Delaware though you can likely save millions in taxes with something called the “Delaware loophole.”

In Delaware intangible assets — think trademarks copyrights and leases — are free from taxation. Companies will often transfer these assets to a Delaware subsidiary and pay their own subsidiary for the rights to use said assets. This saves them money on both ends:

The company can write off these payments in its home state dramatically lowering its tax bill. The company isn’t taxed on its dealings in Delaware.

So if you pay your Delaware subsidiary — let’s call it “Tennis Ballz LLC” — $80m for the rights to use your own copyrights you could potentially cut your taxable income down from $100m to $20m saving you millions in taxes.

As any Delaware tax attorney will attest to the system is a bit more complex than this. But the process can generally be simplified as such:

The most famous real-life example of this comes courtesy of Toys “R” Us.

Twenty years ago the national chain formed a Delaware subsidiary — Geoffrey LLC — and paid the subsidiary an annual fee for the rights to use its own name and mascot. In 1990 alone these payments allowed them to skirt around $2.8m ($5.5m today) in South Carolina state taxes.

Incorporating in Delaware comes with a slew of other tax perks including:

No state corporate income tax

No sales tax

No tax on interest/other investment income

No value-added taxes

No personal property tax

No inheritance tax

Instead all a business pays is a franchise tax ($175-$180k depending on size) and small agent annual report and registration fees.

For the state of Delaware these small fees add up to as much as 41% of the state’s entire revenue. In 2019 they collectively amounted to $1.4B.

For other states the deal isn’t so sweet: It has been estimated that the Delaware loophole costs other states as much as $9.5B per year in collective lost tax revenue.

But taxes aren’t the main benefit of incorporating in Delaware: Most businesses are in it for privacy and courts.

Corporate privacy and expediency

When a company wants to incorporate in Delaware it works through a registered agent — a person in the state who acts as a middleman collecting paperwork and providing the company with a physical address.

In Delaware there are 2 huge registered agent firms:

CT Corporation (1209 Orange Street) is home to 285k+ businesses including Walmart Apple and Coca-Cola. CSC (2711 Centerville Road) houses firms like McDonald’s Amazon and Facebook.

This nondescript office building at 1209 North Orange Street in Wilmington Delaware is the address of ~300k corporations from all over the world — but none of them are actually based here. (Wikipedia)

In Delaware the incorporation process can take less than one hour to complete — and the state doesn’t require companies to disclose the names of officers and directors allowing for anonymity.

“Delaware is the state that requires the least amount of information” a business registration agent in Delaware told The New York Times in 2012. “Basically it requires none. Delaware has the most secret companies in the world and the easiest to form.”

Carl Levin a retired senator from Michigan has said that it’s easier to set up a corporation in Delaware than obtain a driver’s license.

This expediency coupled with the allure of anonymity has attracted a slew of shady enterprises to Delaware in recent years:

Viktor Bout  a Russian arms dealer once known as “the merchant of death” had nearly a dozen Delaware shell companies.

 a Russian arms dealer once known as “the merchant of death” had nearly a dozen Delaware shell companies. Tim Durham used a Delaware shell company to run a $207m Ponzi scheme on more than 5k elderly Americans.

used a Delaware shell company to run a $207m Ponzi scheme on more than 5k elderly Americans. Carl Ferrer used a Delaware shell company to house the sex trafficking website Backpage.com.

used a Delaware shell company to house the sex trafficking website Backpage.com. El Chapo used a Delaware LLC to hide cartel drug money.

Of course the vast majority of Delaware corporations and LLCs are legit enterprises. And for these firms the courts are a major draw.

A favorable court system

Delaware has what is called a Court of Chancery.

Here corporate lawsuits are resolved by the court’s judges — who specialize in corporate law — rather than juries. While the average civil trial in America can take 2-3 years to resolve Delaware’s process is far more expedient.

The judicial officers of Delaware’s Court of Chancery oversee the state’s business-related litigation (Delaware.gov)

As Priceonomics reported the Court of Chancery’s former head judge once famously said: “If you need an answer in four days you’ll get an answer in four days. [Delaware’s] Supreme Court will turn heaven and earth itself to give you an appellate answer.”

Many legal experts claim that these courts are overwhelmingly favorable to corporations — particularly when it comes to shareholder disputes.

Bigger picture

Despite its favorable climate Delaware’s status as a domestic tax haven is widely debated.

But there is no denying that the state is part of a broader trend that has seen the US shift away from financial transparency in recent decades.

According to the Tax Justice Network an advocacy group that tracks tax avoidance the US is now the second-largest tax haven in the world trailing only the Cayman Islands.

American’s so-called “wealth defense” industry — a system rife with shell companies secret cash caches and tax avoidance mechanisms — has widened the nation’s income inequality gap.

Efforts to rectify this are underway.

A new federal law passed in late 2020 banned anonymous shell companies in the US. But the full picture of how this might affect Delaware remains unclear.

GUANGZHOU China — If you talk about chipmaking two companies usually spring to mind — Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung Electronics. The two Asian firms combined control more than 70% of the semiconductor manufacturing market. The U.S. which was once a leader lags behind in this space after monumental shifts in the business models in the semiconductor industry. But a global semiconductor shortage and geopolitical tensions with China have bolstered Washington's scrutiny of the supply chain which is concentrated in the hands of a small number of players and has created a drive to bring manufacturing back to American soil to regain leadership. The U.S. has earmarked billions of dollars and is reportedly looking at alliances with other nations. Semiconductors are critical to everything from cars to the smartphones we use. And they have also been thrust into the center of U.S.-China tensions. ""One characteristic of US policy is that it has heavy emphasis on China. This has now become a national imperative to enhance self-sufficiency in semis production accelerated by the recent chip shortages and the 'tech war' against China"" Bank of America said in a note published Wednesday.

How Asia came to dominate manufacturing

The key to understanding the geopolitics of semiconductors which countries dominate and why the U.S. is trying to boost its domestic industry lies in coming to grips with the supply chain and business models. Companies like Intel are integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) which design and manufacture their own chips. Then there are the fabless semiconductor firms which design chips but outsource manufacturing to so-called foundries. The two biggest foundries are TSMC in Taiwan and Samsung Electronics in South Korea.

Over the last 15 years or so companies began shifting to this fabless model. TSMC and Samsung took advantage as they began to invest heavily in leading-edge manufacturing technology. Now if a company like Apple wants to get the latest chip for their iPhone produced they have to turn to TSMC to do it. TSMC has 55% foundry market share and Samsung has 18% according to data from Trendforce. Taiwan and South Korea collectively have 81% of the global market in foundries highlighting the dominance and reliance on these two countries as well as on TSMC and Samsung.

""In 2001 30 companies manufactured at the leading edge however as semi manufacturing grew in cost and difficulty this number has fallen to just 3 firms"" — TSMC Intel and Samsung according to a note from Bank of America published in December. However Intel's manufacturing process is still behind that of TSMC and Samsung. ""Taiwan and South Korea have become leaders in wafer fabrication which requires massive capital investment; and part of their success over the last 20 years is due to supportive government policies and access to skilled labour forces"" Neil Campling head of technology media and telecoms research at Mirabaud Securities told CNBC by email.

The complex supply chain

While TSMC and Samsung are the dominant manufacturers of semiconductors they still rely heavily on equipment and machinery from the U.S. Europe and Japan. The companies that make these tools required by foundries are known as semiconductor capital equipment vendors or ""semicap"" for short. The top five semicap equipment vendors make up nearly 70% of the market according to Bank of America citing Gartner data. Three of the five are U.S. companies one is European and one is Japanese. Netherlands-based ASML is the only company in the world that can make so-called extreme ultraviolet (EUV) which is required to make the most advanced chips such as those manufactured by TSMC and Samsung.

What is the U.S. planning and why?

So the U.S. is not necessarily falling behind in the semiconductor industry as a whole. Some of its firms are integral to the supply chain. But one area it has lagged in is manufacturing. Under President Joe Biden the U.S. is looking to regain leadership in manufacturing and secure supply chains. In February Biden signed an executive order which involves a review of the semiconductor supply chain to identify risks. As part of a $2 trillion economic stimulus package $50 billion was earmarked for semiconductor manufacturing and research. A bill known as the CHIPS for America Act is also working its way through the legislative process and aims to provide incentives to enable advanced research and development and secure the supply chain.

Meanwhile U.S. firm Intel last month announced plans to spend $20 billion to build two new chip factories and said it will act as a foundry. This could offer a domestic alternative to the likes of TSMC and Samsung. Part of that scrutiny on the supply chain has been prompted by a global chip shortage that's hit the automotive industry. The coronavirus pandemic accelerated demand for personal electronics like laptops and games consoles just as industrials and automakers wound down production. But a rebound in production plus heightened demand for chips in various sectors has triggered a shortage. The concentration of production in the hands of TSMC and Samsung has worsened the problem. The semiconductor supply shortage ""has probably made the U.S. administration realise they aren't in control of their own destiny"" according to Mirabaud Securities' Campling. But there are also geopolitical factors at play informing U.S. policy. ""Over the longer-term the Biden administration wants to continue to encourage both foreign and U.S. semiconductor manufacturers to expand capacity in the U.S. to reduce dependence on manufacturing in geopolitically sensitive areas such as Taiwan and create high paying engineering jobs in the U.S."" Paul Triolo head of the geo-technology practice at Eurasia Group told CNBC by email.

Part of the U.S. policy in the semiconductor space involves forming alliances. Earlier this month the Nikkei reported that the U.S. and Japan will cooperate on supply chains for critical components like semiconductors. The two sides will aim for a system where production is not concentrated on specific regions like Taiwan the Nikkei said. ""The U.S. is trying to cut China out of the equation"" Abishur Prakash a geopolitical specialist at the Center for Innovating the Future a Toronto-based consulting firm told CNBC via email. ""It is trying to redesign how the world's chip industry works in the face of a rising China. This is not necessarily about self-sufficiency although Washington would welcome this. Instead it is about building up critical sectors — from AI to chips — that are insulated from geopolitics. And because several nations share U.S. concerns about China the U.S. is taking a chunk of the world with it.""

China's push for self-sufficiency

China meanwhile is trying to push self-sufficiency amid U.S. moves to cut it off from key supplies. Over the past few years China has tried to boost its semiconductor industry through huge investments and incentives like tax breaks. But China remains well behind everywhere else and that goes back to the supply chain. SMIC is China's largest foundry a competitor to the likes of TSMC and Samsung. But SMIC's technology is several years behind that of its Taiwan and South Korean rivals.

Kelyn Spadoni 33 was taken into custody Wednesday on charges of theft valued over $25000 bank fraud and illegal transmission of monetary funds nola.com and WVUE-TV reported. The reports said she was fired by the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office after her arrest.

Spadoni is being held at the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center on a $50000 bond. It was unknown if she has an attorney who could speak on her behalf.

Spadoni is accused of immediately moving the funds to another account and using some of the money to buy a new car and a house authorities said.

Authorities said a clerical error had caused Charles Schwab a major financial services corporation to deposit more than $1.2 million into her brokerage account when it only meant to transfer about $82 in February nola.com reported. When the bank attempted to reclaim the money the request was rejected because the money was not available according to the sheriff's office.

The sheriff's office said it was later learned that Spadoni had moved the funds into another account.

Capt. Jason Rivarde a sheriff's spokesman said that although the money was put into her account ""it's not her money.""

""She has no legal claim to that money"" he added. ""Even if it was put in there by mistake. It was an accounting error.""

Charles Schwab & Co. sued Spadoni on Tuesday in federal court. The company tried to contact Spadoni several times to have the transferred funds returned but were unsuccessful Rivarde said. So far about 75% of the money has been recovered he added.

The company argued in its lawsuit that Spadoni's account contract with Schwab includes an agreement that if a client receives an overpayment of funds the client is required to return the full amount.

""If someone accidentally puts an extra zero on a utility payment they would want that money returned or credited to them. This is no different"" Rivarde said.

This is one of the largest amounts pledged in the financial services industry towards green causes.

By making this announcement it has more than tripled its earlier budget of $300 billion that it had announced in 2019. In total the second largest bank in the United States has now committed an estimated $1.5 trillion towards green finance and social inclusion initiatives such as racial and gender equality healthcare affordable housing and education.

These funds have been earmarked to push for green initiatives through lending capital raising advisory and investment services to help low-carbon and other sustainable businesses.

“The private sector is well-positioned to ensure that the capital needed – at the scale it is needed – can drive the transition to a low-carbon sustainable economy” said Bank of America Vice Chairman Anne Finucane who leads the company’s environmental social and governance (ESG) sustainable finance and public policy efforts. “We will meet our commitment by working with clients to provide lending capital raising advisory and investment services and to develop financial solutions and drive innovation to ensure the transition to a sustainable economy.”

Earlier in February Bank of America also committed to reach its goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions before 2050.

However Bank of America is not the only financial services giant that has taken a step towards sustainability. In March Mastercard Inc said that it would link the bonuses for its senior management to their performance of aiding the organization in achieving its green goals of cutting its carbon usage.

Similarly Citigroup Inc also initiated a new investment banking unit to support efforts towards environmental sustainability.

He said visitors to the exhibition which opened on Friday would be able to imagine Moore industriously working away in his studio finding new shapes and textures.

“The exhibition serves as a reminder that sculpture is as much an art of the hand – in its making and appreciation – as of the eye. An object may be small in size but large in scale” he said.

The show billed as the first of its kind features sculptures in stone wood terracotta plaster lead bronze and Plasticine and takes in themes recurrent in Moore’s work: the reclining female figure mother and child the human head the fallen warrior. It has works from every decade of his career from the 1920s to the 1980s.

The first piece the visitor encounters is a mother and child from the 1920s modelled in Plasticine which pleasingly was invented at the end of the 19th century by a teacher at Bath Academy of Art William Harbutt. It sits next to a small animal head made of boxwood in 1921.

Another intriguing display features of a pair of mother-and-childs from the 1930s modelled in plaster and cast in lead which Moore melted in saucepans on a kitchen stove. Stephens said the lead gave the pieces a “poisonous” air which perhaps reflected political times as the world headed towards war.

Seen in public for the first time is a collection of small terracotta heads that Moore modelled while planning two carved heads for a church at Much Hadham in Hertfordshire in the 1950s.

Stephens said: “These reflect his interest in classical traditions tribal masks and perhaps the graffiti carved into walls in Paris captured by the photographer Brassaï.” Moore’s fingerprints and tool marks are clearly visible in the heads.

The final displays are maquettes for yet more mother and child sculptures dating from the late 1970s and early 1980s and a cabinet of found objects from his studio that Moore worked with – bones flints stones.

Presented in partnership with the Henry Moore Foundation the exhibition features more than 60 works gathered in one room on the top floor of the museum. Moore’s daughter Mary Moore said she was delighted these smaller pieces would be seen.

She said: “An enormous amount of Henry Moore’s work – particularly the starting point for his universally familiar large-scale sculpture – began with his modelling with his turning moulding and forming in the palm of his hands.”

By way of contrast a second show that opened at the Holburne on Friday stars a very different artist – Sam Cox better known as Mr Doodle who has almost 3 million followers on Instagram sells his work for hundreds of thousands of pounds a time and has covered every inch of his Kent home with his intricate patterns.

Mr Doodle! Museum Mayhem is the first UK museum exhibition of his work with the Holburne allowing Doodle to take over parts of the building and daub it with his “graffiti spaghetti” of black ink on white background.

He has also been given the go-ahead to replace some of its pieces with his own work. For example John Constable’s Flatford Lock from the Bridge (circa 1814-17) has been replaced with Doodle House from the Gates (2024).

Doodle studied illustration at UWE Bristol and used to bring a suitcase of his work to Bath to try to barter for a meal or a drink. “That was mostly unsuccessful” he said. “It’s cool to come back and do something grander.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy9jeGU4M2owNWtseG_SATJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvY3hlODNqMDVrbHhvLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Historic Royal Navy dolphin bell goes on display in Bath,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9maWxtcy8yMDI0LzA1LzA0L2thdGUtd2luc2xldC1zdGFycy13YXItcGhvdG9ncmFwaGVyLXdhc2hlZC1oaXRsZXJzLWJhdGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kate Winslet stars as war photographer who washed in Hitler's bath,"Looking every inch the battle-hardened foreign correspondent this is Kate Winslet as World War Two photographer Lee Miller.

But home turf can’t be treated as familiar turf Baxter explained.

“Just because you know where things are doesn’t mean you know how things are going to go.” To boot Laguna Seca “was cocky out there and he’s hard to ride when he’s like that. Very strong and shaking his head causing us to get under a few things out there. But he came out of all the combination exits well.”

It’s a major move up for the horse who first went Advanced in March. Because he’s green Baxter had not planned to go pedal to metal and they added 10.8 to their dressage score to complete with a 53.2. Lauren LoPiccolo and Diego also had only time penalties to complete the first CCI4*-S for horse and rider on a 60.1.

Baxter’s barn mate at Twin Rivers Ranch Lauren Burnell and her 14-year-old Holsteiner Counterpoint were featured on the Spring International program’s cover. They lived up to front page status by taking the lead with double clear show jumping and only some accidental time penalties on cross-country. “I had the Preliminary time in my head and was thinking about that” said Burnell whose final score was a 38.

The imposing Ditch Wall at 10 and bending track to a corner rode more easily than Burnell expected and Counterpoint’s “saint-like” composure saved her coming through the Palm Tree Water Cabins. Burnell is thrilled to fulfill her goal of returning to this level successfully after her 3-and-a-half-year old son arrived. “It feels faster after having a baby” she laughed. “The wind hits your face differently!”

Young rider Kelsey Holmes was already thrilled with double clear show jumping and finishing cross-country with only 1.6 time penalties. Jumping into second place as a result with her partner of eight years NZB The Chosen One was a nice surprise. She appreciated the significant changes to the course since they’d competed here in March when the track was tightly packed with combinations and sharp turns. With several jumps used for both the Long and Short format tracks today’s course “felt very open” and presented nice variety to test their skills.

On a gap year before law school Holmes has had “Squid” a 17.3 hand 15-year-old Hanoverian since she was in middle school. “I’m not a very emotional person but today when I was untacking Squid I kind of teared up thinking about how amazing he’s been to me all these years. I’m so lucky to have him still sound happy and eager.” She blamed herself for a subpar dressage score of 39.3 which started them in 8th place before ending on a 40.9.

As the only pair to finish within the time on cross-country Kayla Bierman and Addyson moved into third. They’d tied for 10th after dressage on a 46.7.

Levine Holds 4*-L Lead

At the second-to-last of 40 efforts “I thought ‘This is actually happening'” said Amber Levine of a faultless finish with Cellar Farm’s Cinzano today to stay on their 31.5 lead going into show jumping tomorrow morning. The Jeffs Hot Tub Waves complex at 19 a/b was the awkward exception to a Hugh Lochore-designed course that otherwise “rode great” for the 10-year-old Holsteiner in his long-delayed debut at the level. An entirely new portion of the course around the racetrack featured a series of bright-white painted obstacles but nothing distracted Cinzano’s “tunnel vision for those flags.” Levine expects a similarly game attitude tomorrow and has a rail to spare.

Marc Grandia and Campari FFF were clear in jumping efforts and time to move into second after Madison Temkin and Dr. Hart dropped down with a run-out at the tricky left turn to a log in the Palm Tree Water at 6a. “I’m just mad at myself” said Temkin. Dr. Hart popped over it easily on the second try and whizzed around to pick up only 3.6 time penalties. Going onto the racetrack in the first third of the course was easy Temkin says of the Off-The-Track Thoroughbred’s game attitude. “He went right over to the rail but it was a little hard getting him to turn off it.”

The young professional from Full Circle Farm and Dr. Hart have risen up the levels together and this is their first 4*-L.

Temkin’s penalties enabled Bec Braitling and Caravaggio II to move into third after a cross-country run the Australian professional is thrilled with. Like her barn mate and good friend Andrea Baxter Braitling said it’s not easy showing at home. “We lost some time early out on the track with the new jumps. He saw that white steeplechase from 1000 yards away and said ‘No!’. We struggled to get a rhythm there. There is no such thing as a home field advantage.”

Braitling had immediately high expectations for the 10-year-old British Sporthorse purchased as a 6-year-old. After finishing 5th at the Galway Downs 4*-S two weeks ago this is his debut in the Long format. “I knew straight away I wanted him and that I would take him to Kentucky one day.” He has a big step and gallop is easy to ride and the good kind of spookiness that works to their advantage most of the time Braitling explained. In Friday’s dressage maybe not so much but once they nail down the flying changes she’s confident the sky’s the limit for “Ernie.”

Patterson Atop the 3*-L

Young rider Alina Patterson and her own 10-year-old German Sporthorse Flashback have a two-rail lock on the division after clean and fast cross-country. The Washington-based rider’s slight concerns about her horse’s stamina were erased as he had fuel to spare going into show jumping.

Alessandra Allen-Shinn and Fool Me Once were also double clear today to move into second on a 39.4. Unfortunately the division’s third contenders Alexis Helffrich and M Creme De La Creme SE retired on cross-country paring the show jumping finalé to two.

Nielsen & New Ride Lead the 2*-L

Yesterday Sacramento-area professional Marissa Nielsen accomplished her goal of a “boring and accurate test” with Global Absolute. That paid off in the form of a 28.3 division leading dressage score to which they added no penalties today. It’s the first FEI competition for the 7-year-old Mecklenburg and their new partnership takes an auspicious start into show jumping.

The top three standings remained unchanged as another professional Barb Crabo of Arizona maintains the second seed with her 10-year-old Sport Pony Mine the Melody. In third are Jessica DiCostanzo and Cocoa Z a 9-year-old Zangershiede mare who are moving up the levels together since pairing up three years ago.

An entrepreneur who launched the equestrian marketing company Equivont around the same time DiConstanzo used to be a jumper rider then an FEI level dressage rider. “I was kind of struggling between the two disciplines then I realized I could do both with eventing.”

Thus far cross-country has been a weak point relative to strong dressage and show jumping but today indicated otherwise with bold clearance of obstacles that had been issues in the past. DiCostanzo credits Bec Braitling for putting some valuable training miles on the mare while she recovered from a broken leg. She credits Cocoa with taking the reins in a few of the track’s many tricky spots. A double clear keeps them on a 30.8 dressage for tomorrow’s show jumping. “She is very scopey and careful especially for a little horse. I just hope I can give her the ride she deserves.”

The standings are tight in this division: the top six are all within a rail of one another. James Alliston and Calaro Camille Brewer and Cooley Rock Star and Josey Thompson and Pistol Annie are all capable of taking over the lead if things go their way over Marc Donovan’s course.

Sunday Schedule

Long format horses have their final inspection Sunday morning starting at 7:30 a.m. Then the Flag Ring that was dressed for dressage on Friday is transformed into the stage for an exciting show jumping conclusion. International ceremonies begin with the National Anthem at 11:40 then 4*-L at 11:45; 3*-L at 12:40; and 2*-L at 1:35.

Awards will be presented at the conclusion of each division. In the 4*-L this will include $5000 in prizes and the presentation of the inaugural McKinglaigh Cup. The beautiful trophy has been donated by Thom Schulz in honor of his lovely late wife Laura Coats. Schulz and Coats owned McKinlaigh the Irish Sporthorse who partnered with Gina Miles in 2008 Olympic individual silver. McKinlaigh was developed and lived out his retired life at the couple’s Rainbow Ranch in nearby Creston.

Winners of each of the Long Format divisions will also receive a custom jump made by Jen and Earl McFall’s Dragonfire Farm along with prizes from Twin Rivers’ generous sponsors.

The Spring International is made possible by generous sponsors: Presenting sponsors include Professional’s Choice manufacturers of sports medicine boots for equine athletes; Auburn Labs manufacturers of the adaptogenic APF Formula for horses people and dogs; Best Western PLUS Black Oak which offers exclusive discounts for exhibitors; and Get Away RV Rentals which delivers fully-outfitted RVs to the venue for those who want to stay on site.

Obviously we'll miss Tim Allen as Mike Baxter but we can't forget about the amazing Nancy Travis as his loyal and loving wife Vanessa Baxter. Since the very first episode of Last Man Standing the Baxter family matriarch has proved herself to be a perfect foil for her husband's politically incorrect humor and antics. Plus she's a devoted mother to the couple's three daughters Kristin Mandy and Eve. Did we mention she's also an accomplished geologist? Is there anything Vanessa can't do?

While you soak up every last moment of Last Man Standing before the final episode airs sometime in May get to know the actress who plays Mike Baxter's wife by reading these fun facts about Nancy Travis.

Nancy has been married for more than 25 years.

Since 1994 Nancy has been married to Robert N. Fried a film producer and studio executive who has produced movies such as Rudy and Hoosiers. That's more than 25 years of wedded bliss which is definitely hard to come by as far as Hollywood marriages go.

In the early years of her acting career Nancy recalls that her ""game plan basically was to systematically be Meryl Streep.”

Ron Galella // Getty Images

“What I didn’t include in my original game plan were the compromises that I would make along the way to basically have everything if that makes any sense"" she said in an interview with The Columbus Dispatch. ""I knew I wanted to have a family. I knew I wanted to have a marriage and hopefully have it be the only marriage.”



While Nancy admits she may not be Meryl Streep (there can only be one after all) she's definitely achieved her goal of having a happy marriage and family!

She’s a mom of two kids.

Nancy and Robert have two children together sons Benjamin (born in 1998) and Jeremy (born in 2001).

Alberto E. Rodriguez // Getty Images

When it comes to family life Nancy is a lot like her character on Last Man Standing.

“I’m basically a traditionalist” Nancy told The Columbus Dispatch. “I like to cook dinner; I like to be with my kids."" So sweet!

Nancy’s been in a lot of other popular movies and shows.

Nancy is one of those timeless actresses who's been in many movies and shows. For starters the 1987 hit comedy Three Men and Baby is one of her most popular films and also where she got her big break in Hollywood. In the movie Nancy played Sylvia Bennington Ted Danson's former flame and the mother of the titular baby. (Side note: Imagine kicking off your career alongside not only a young Ted Danson but a young Tom Selleck too. We're not swooning you're swooning!)

IMDb

Anyways you may also recognize Nancy from her roles in the sequel Three Men and a Little Lady So I Married an Axe Murderer and Air America. She's also starred in the CBS sitcoms Almost Perfect and Becker (with Ted Danson again!) as well as the Netflix comedy series The Kominsky Method.

Speaking of Nancy might not be coming back to Netflix's ""The Kominsky Method""

Michael Yarish/Netflix

Unfortunately it sounds like Nancy won't be returning to The Kominsky Method for the final season. Per TVLine Nancy was reportedly ""unable to reprise her role as divorcée/acting student Lisa due to scheduling conflicts with Last Man Standing's own farewell run."" On the show which follows Michael Douglas as revered Hollywood acting coach Sandy Kominsky Nancy played a recent divorcée who took lessons from Sandy and went on to become his love interest. Nancy was great on this show too but we're glad she's sticking with Last Man Standing 'til the end.

No Nancy Travis isn't related to Randy Travis.

Since Nancy and country singer-songwriter Randy Travis share the same last name fans have often wondered if the two stars are married or related. But we did some digging and it turns out there's no connection—other than the fact that they're both super talented!

There you have it folks. That's everything you need to know about Nancy Travis. So are you going to miss her as Vanessa Baxter? Share your thoughts in the comments!",,,,,,,,,

That's because the environment for stock picking is ripe for a shift away from passive investing which could suffer a decade of low or nonexistent returns.

""This is the single worst time to be a passive investor in since they started passive investments... The [S&P 500] index is highly likely to not make money over the next 10 years"" said Bill Smead chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management during the most recent Yahoo Finance Plus webinar on Wednesday. ""Whether you look at historical price earnings ratios whether you look at the normalization of interest rates whether you look at ridiculously high levels of participation by individual investors — compared to household network going back for decades it all points to the same thing. The markets are not designed to make the majority succeed.""

'You have to be a deviant to outperform'

In investing parlance alpha is the return above and beyond a benchmark such as the S&P 500 — in other words a trader's edge. By definition an investor in an ETF that tracks the index such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) will see no alpha. But an active trader needs to find alpha by thinking differently.

""Alpha comes from deviation. You have to be a deviant to outperform — not a non-deviant"" said Smead.

Not all stock pickers are alike. Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation ETF quickly became the world's largest actively managed ETF with $28 billion in assets under management at its February peak. Over the last year the fund loaded up on high growth names like Tesla (TSLA) Square (SQ) and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).

Smead prefers a more value-focused approach that also incorporates growth strategies. He uses a few recent examples to warn how quickly momentum trades can reverse. ""[W]hen money comes out of popular growth stocks it's like a fire hose. And the companies that it's going into are a teacup. You're pouring water from a fire hose into a teacup. And that's also part of what happened with Reddit and Archegos"" he said.

Many of the names that Archegos Capital Management owned prior to its spectacular blowup were value names that benefitted from huge surges before epic collapses. Smead managed to profit from the two his fund owned Discovery (DISCA) and Macerich (MAC) but he would have preferred they hadn't gone so far so fast. (The Smead Value Fund is up 21% as of March 31 after gaining 66% over the trailing four quarters.)

""When you own what is a meritorious and undervalued common stock the ideal circumstance for you is for that undervaluation to get worked off over an extensive time period of say two or three four years"" Smead said.

Nevertheless he still likes Discovery and uses it to explain why a business' free cash flow — the cash coming in minus the cash going out — is the most important metric to find undervalued companies.

""[Discovery's] business of creating unscripted television costs 10% of scripted television and therefore it is incredibly profitable and generates massive free cash flow"" said Smead who has a final warning for investors who have been rewarded by high-growth names.

""[Y]ou should always be very nervous when a stock goes parabolic"" said Smead who was surprised at the consistent returns of high-growth names over the last five years. ""That is one of the most unusual things I've seen in my 41 years in the business. And asking for that to happen regularly is a ticket to lose significant amounts of your capital.""

Tennessee school districts are required to offer these camps to address learning gaps that may have occurred due to the pandemic. But it's up to parents to decide whether their students will attend. Families have until April 20 to enroll their students.

Knox News asked KCS leaders to provide additional information about who will be teaching these camps and what accommodations will be available for students with disabilities.

Here's what we know.

What is a learning loss or bridge camp?

Elementary students have the option to attend a summer learning program that runs for six weeks.

Each day includes:

4 hours of reading writing and math instruction;

1 hour of intervention;

1 hour of play;

1 hour of S.T.R.E.A.M. instruction. (Science technology reading engineering art math)

Middle school students have the option to attend a summer learning loss bridge program that runs for four weeks.

Each day includes:

4 hours of reading and math instruction

1 hour of intervention

1 hour of physical activity

The camps are free. Bus transportation meals and academic testing are all included as well. Camps are in-person and will follow the district's existing COVID-19 practices.

How many people are eligible to participate?

Students were selected based on several factors – some outlined by the state and others specific to Knox County assistant superintendent and chief academic officer Jon Rysewyk told Knox News.

""So we cast a pretty broad net to try to get students who showed any kind of deficiency and and let me say this students show deficiencies on any given year"" Rysewyk said. ""So it wasn't necessarily all of these deficiencies are COVID-related you know who can ever really tell for sure what those are or aren't.""

The district identified 26714 kindergarten through seventh graders eligible to do a learning camp this summer. That's about 76.4 % of all K-7 students. Those families were invited.

""We turned over every rock looking for any data source to say 'hey this is an opportunity'"" Rysewyk said. ""We don't have you know state funds every summer to be able to extend the year and offer these camps. So we want to make sure we have a very broad net to be able to get as many students as we can into these camps or have the invite to be able to come to it.""

Right now the district does not plan to welcome students who weren't specifically invited KCS spokeswoman Carly Harrington said.

What if my student doesn't qualify?:Summer camps are back for 2021! See our huge list of how to keep kids busy during break

If I sign my child up who will be teaching my child?

The state law allows students to be taught by trained teachers a person training to become a teacher or a person who has a college degree who has undergone training by the state.

KCS is planning to use its own certified teachers as much as possible for this first year Rysewyk said. This is especially true for the reading and math segments.

Lawmakers created a program that will include a state network of tutors. But for this first year Rysewyk said the district is planning to work with groups that already do after school programming to potentially help with the S.T.R.E.A.M. portion for elementary students.

When is the deadline to sign up for these camps?

April 20. Eligible families should have received an email from their child school with a link to sign up.

My student has an Individualized Education Program. What happens next?

Students with disabilities can attend these camps. The camps will not be working on specific goals outlined in the student's IEP but schools must provide accommodations modifications and related services needed to make sure students have access to the learning at camps.

Executive director of students supports Jason Myers said parents do not have to call an IEP meeting in order for their child to attend camp but as always parents can request an IEP meeting at any time.

How do I make sure my child gets those accommodations?

Myers said the first step is to reach out to your child's case manager. He said decisions are individualized to a student's needs. For example if a student needed an aide to access learning in the camp setting they would be provided with one.

""We are obligated and certainly passionate about making sure that our kids with disabilities get access to what they need"" Myers said.

While a student with a disability isn't working toward specific IEP goals during the camps families should feel comfortable reaching out to the camp's teacher if they are concerned about something during the camp's duration said Kathleen Basham the Arc of Tennessee family engagement specialist for the East region.

Melissa Goin is a mother of a second grade student with autism. She worked with her son's IEP team to make sure her son would have access to the camp.

""We basically as a team we discussed what he would need to in order to access this opportunity "" Goin told Knox News. ""We went through all the accommodations and modifications that he would need and we as a team we agreed quite easily that he would need all of these things and that he would receive them. It was great to see.""

Goin said she's excited to have her son not only continue school this summer but stay on a routine and have social interaction.

""We're tickled"" Goin said.

Will there be a special education teacher at each school that is hosting summer camps?

Staffing will be determined by school principals and site leads. Myers said his team is working on a district-level to make sure all students receive appropriate accommodations.

How are summer learning camps different from Extended School Year?

Extended school year is specifically offered to students with disabilities who need the summer program to make progress on their IEP goals. The summer camps exist because the state legislature is concerned students experienced gaps in learning due to COVID-19.

Can my student participate in both Extended School Year and summer camps?

Students' IEP teams decide if Extended School Year is the right option. If your student is invited to both programs they can attend both.

Myers said if a child does do both programs their Extended School Year programming would be altered based off what the student is already learning in the camp setting.

Is there a high school option?

The camps are specifically for elementary and middle school students. But Knox County Schools is offering its normal credit recovery program. This allows high school students to complete work needed to graduate.

This program runs June 1 through July 2. Students use a program called Edgenuity and are monitored by KCS staff. All students are expected to attend the first 10 days and then may have the option to complete the rest of their work from home.

Counselors will reach out to students and families before May 25 about this option.

But it certainly is worth looking at: The drone in retail packaging. Oh and if you happen to live near Hickory North Carolina you might want to hop in your car and check it out.

This is getting to be pretty routine: DJI ships a product to retailers in preparation for a launch. One of those retailers either in error or deliberately puts that product out on the floor in advance. We saw this happen at more than one Best Buy location with the Mini 2: People simply walked in the store and bought the drone. (And in at least one of the cases created a YouTube channel for an unboxing video and got a ton of views.)

And now the very first part of that equation is repeating itself: It’s on the shelf at at least one Best Buy apparently in Hickory North Carolina.

Two photos

Guess we can’t even call the photos we’re about to see “leaked” – since someone clearly just went into a store and took pictures of the box the Air 2S will ship with. But we can credit @OsitaLV for finding these images and amplifying them. Here’s his Tweet:

Sold my Air 2. pic.twitter.com/hbZLmFWxA2 — OsitaLV (@OsitaLV) April 10 2021 There it is!

What do the Air 2S photos tell us?

Not a ton but some. Let’s see:

The first one shows the front of the box in what’s clearly an electronics store. You can see the television display just over the top of the box. The Fly More Combo box indicates a 1-inch CMOS sensor as we’ve previously reported (also thanks to @OsitaLV). It also indicates the product has ADS-B AirSense detection a really superb function that we recently wrote a short feature about. Not much else to see here that we haven’t already seen in this photo.

Air 2S photo two:

This one is slightly more fun:

This particular angle doesn’t reveal any specs. But it does show that it was shipped to Best Buy on April 4 of this year. It also says the Best Buy location is store number 425.

When we Google that the results indicate the store is in Hickory North Carolina. So if your’e near there and want to beat the rush… you might just have your chance.

However it’s worth nothing that DJI products don’t actually work until the software you use on your phone or tablet is enabled. And DJI never does that prior to the release date. So if you’re hoping to get flying or make a video of it flying you’ll be out of luck.

But if you want to own it now or start a YouTube channel – now’s your chance!

For someone who tests some of the best TVs  I’m oddly unconcerned with my own entertainment set-up at home. Don’t get me wrong: a 65-inch OLED TV paired with a powerful soundbar and maybe a few dynamic strip lights sounds sublime. It’s just not something I need to have.

I’m even less preoccupied with my TV-watching in the apartment I’ve recently moved into. Space in my new place is limited and for aesthetic reasons I don’t want the space littered with wires and other unsightly AV equipment. I’m even opposed to a black screen taking up precious wall real estate.

Like most solutions to my problems these days the idea to purchase a portable projector instead of a TV for my apartment came from TikTok. A few weeks ago I stumbled upon a short video in which someone used a small projector and a scenic window-view clip from YouTube to transform their average bedroom into an enchanting escape . I immediately wanted to recreate this experience in my own room.

Although TikTok has driven many of my impulse purchases before I took time to research what I needed to buy from the actual projector model itself to the accompanying cables and dongles. The most surprising thing I soon realized is that the top-rated projectors cost the same if not more than some of the best cheap TVs . Amazon also had hundreds of models to choose from so how was I to know which to get?

I knew I was probably in the market for a pico projector or battery-powered projector that can fit in a bag or move room to room. Depending on how much you’re willing to spend you’re able to find pico projectors with internal memory decent built-in speakers and proprietary smart interfaces with streaming apps. The $350 Anker Nebula Apollo offers Android TV apps for example. The $500 LG Minibeam LED Projector even has a built-in TV tuner.

Of course you could also forgo these features by relying on one of the best streaming devices or your laptop as your projector’s source. Since my MacBook Pro is permanently on my nightstand I figured a non-smart projector could fulfill my vision. It would also help me save some dough.

Settling for less than 1080p picture quality instead of 4K would also keep the price low — barbaric I know. Most pico projectors have low resolutions compared to top-rated TVs. If a sharp picture is important to you pico probably isn’t the way to go. You’d want to consider a permanent laser projector that better suits in-house theater rooms than small New York City bedrooms. Options from JVC Sony and Epsom could run you several thousand dollars though.

The projector I chose

So there I was carefully combing through Amazon user reviews on pico projectors that cost much less when I found someone had attached an image of the exact fake window scene I saw on TikTok. For just $70 the PVO Portable Projector offers HDMI and USB ports. It promised to project a maximum of 150 inches from a device that weighs less than a pound.

PVO portable projector: was $99 now $71 @ Amazon

The PVO mini projector can project a 640 x 360-pixel picture form 60 to 50 inches and is small enough to easily move from room to room. It comes with an HDMI port USB audio and a microSD card slot.

I’ll admit I was a little skeptical about the low price and unfamiliar brand at first. But after setting the projector up on the top edge of my headboard where it can connect to my laptop via HDMI to USB-C adapter and throw on to the blank wall opposite my bed I think it might be the best item I’ve bought for my apartment.

When I’m not copying the TikTok window video from YouTube (which is extremely relaxing in person I must add) I can catch up on reality TV or continue making my way through the list of this year’s Oscar-nominated films. The picture isn’t extremely sophisticated but spanning over 100 inches on my wall I can see plenty of details and contrast.

I improved the experience by pairing my laptop to the Sonos Roam for sound although any Bluetooth speaker would do. I placed the new Sonos speaker on the floor under the projected image so it seemed like the sound came from the screen rather than behind my head.

I’m not saying you should toss your TV and replace it with a cheap projector. A traditional TV provides a stronger picture and solid built-in sound. Most TV displays can maintain brightness in spaces with natural daylight whereas my bedroom needs to be completely dark to see the projector’s content.

But if you’re someone who does most of your watching at night doesn’t want to spend much money or likes the idea of a screen that disappears when you’re not using it I can’t recommend a pico projector enough.

Correction: The resolution of this projector is 640 x 360 pixels and not 1080p.

Some 50 million sales and counting the Californian brand has massively expanded operations with a host of sub-brands including Eufy for smart home tech Soundcore for audio and Nebula projectors as well as some of the very best power banks and wireless charging solutions. But with no less than 542 options available where to begin and what really deserves your cash?

Anker

Let’s start with the bottomless barrel of chargers plugs and peripherals. Despite it being one of the most irritating items you would ever wish to spend money on the Anker Nano (£14) iPhone USB-C plug socket is as good as it gets offering 20W output for rapid charging of the iPhone 12 Samsung Galaxy S20 or equivalent. It’s three times as fast as the standard 5W charger and half the size of most 20W chargers. Not bad for £14 although bring your own cable.

Despite bigger and better phone batteries power banks remain a necessary evil but no matter how stylish cheap or pocket-friendly they might be we’re dismissing anything smaller than 5000mAh. One charge for an iPhone 6 isn’t good enough. The PowerCore Essential 20000 (£30) ticks all the boxes for a bag-friendly battery pack boasting juice-a-plenty to charge an iPhone X five times Galaxy S10 4.8 times and an iPad Mini more than twice. There’s no love for your laptop but it does have Anker’s PowerIQ technology which adjusts the voltage automatically depending on what you’re charging and can even trickle-charge low-power tech such as wireless earbuds.

Spend a little more and the £40 Anker Power Bank PowerCore 26800mAh charger has even more output across three USB as well as dual inputs but if you need office-grade oomph head straight to the Anker Powerhouse II (£300). It has 388Wh capacity that can charge eight devices simultaneously across 300W AC outlet 60W USB-C port 3 USB-A ports a car socket and 2 DC ports meaning you can charge laptops phones and cameras galore. It’s a brute but we have one charged and packed ready for all the camping ‘holidays’ we’ve been forced to book.

Another necessary evil executed impressively by Anker is the USB-C hub. Your laptop looks great and weighs feathers but has naff-all ports which is why you’ll need the future proof fast and flexible Anker USB-C Hub (£38). It has 7-in-1 expansion via your laptop’s USB-C port with high-speed Ethernet (5 Gbps data speeds) 4k 30Hz HDMI SD/TF card readers and two USB-A data ports as well as rapid pass-through charging.

Nebula

Anker’s portable projector division has done wonders for mobile movie nights and the original Nebula Capsule (£340) was a bit of a game changer – and we don't use that phrase lightly. Hyped relentlessly on Kickstarter the standard definition manual-focused single speaker soda can-sized projector’s tech feels underwhelming now especially as the Nebula Capsule II (£549) has 720p resolution (16:9) 8W of audio and Android TV 9.0 built-in with Google Assistant voice control and all the usability that affords. We’ve used it camping (plugged into a laptop via HDMI) in the bath and all over the house and while it needs darkness to thrive it’s undeniably entertaining.

The Nebula Mars II Pro (£480) is the Capsule’s corpulent cousin but another entertaining option around the house and garden thanks to the significantly brighter 500 ANSI-lumen and fan-noise-masking 10W stereo speakers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5aXRlbS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvZ2Vlay1zcXVhZC1zY2FtLXRhcmdldHMtdnVsbmVyYWJsZS1zZW5pb3JzL2FydGljbGVfN2QzZDFkY2UtZjliYS01OTBkLTk4NzEtNzcxYzU1ZjI3MWNjLmh0bWzSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHlpdGVtLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9nZWVrLXNxdWFkLXNjYW0tdGFyZ2V0cy12dWxuZXJhYmxlLXNlbmlvcnMvYXJ0aWNsZV83ZDNkMWRjZS1mOWJhLTU5MGQtOTg3MS03NzFjNTVmMjcxY2MuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Geek Squad' scam targets vulnerable seniors,"Get Breaking News

How the pharmaceutical industry is trying to reduce emissions,"Ten of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies have pledged to improve their energy efficiency.

The pharmaceutical industry has been in the news more than ever since early 2020 as competing companies raced to produce the first COVID-19 vaccine. But now they’re shifting their attention to the other emergency we all face: the climate crisis.

Today ten of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies have pledged to improve their energy efficiency. AstraZeneca Biogen GSK Johnson & Johnson MSD Novartis Novo Nordisk Pfizer Sanofi and Takeda are all part of the programme called Energize.

“Every business should be moving aggressively towards using 100% renewable electricity and supporting their supply chains to do the same.” Sam Kimmins Head of RE100 Climate Group

Energy transformation firm Schneider Electric is running the initiative to support pharmaceutical companies to reduce their environmental impact. It’s been a big year for the French firm having been named the world’s most sustainable corporation by the green capitalist research organisation Corporate Knights.

“Every business should be moving aggressively towards using 100% renewable electricity and supporting their supply chains to do the same” says Sam Kimmins Head of RE100 Climate Group.

How polluting is the pharmaceutical industry?

Researchers at the W Booth School of Engineering Practice & Technology found that the pharmaceutical industry is 55% more emissions-intensive than the car industry. Producing life-saving medicines it turns out is incredibly energy-intensive. As well as the energy needed to make products labs have to be extremely hygienic which uses a lot of water and chemicals and precise temperatures have to be maintained. Add to this the problem that most products have to be thrown away after one use for safety reasons.

How will AstraZeneca and the others transform their energy use?

Often in profit-driven firms investment in sustainable alternatives is simply not on the radar of decision-makers. Corporations involved in this programme will be introduced to the renewable energy market to try to overcome some basic market barriers like inadequate knowledge and confusion in complex renewable energy contracting processes.

As part of Energize AstraZeneca Johnson & Johnson and other pharmaceutical heavyweights will be given the opportunity to buy renewable energy contracts. Companies can choose to contract green energy supplies by themselves or as one collaboration.

At the moment Energize does not include any binding agreements. Pharmaceutical corporations are going to be advised in renewable transitions and given opportunities to go green. But the extent to which they will implement these transformations remains to be seen.

Commenting on ‘Energy Day’ at COP26 “where representatives from around the globe come together to accelerate action towards the mitigation of climate change” Susan Uthayakumar President Sustainable Business at Schneider Electric said “We’re honoured to launch the Energize program and collaborate with the pharmaceutical industry to drive emissions reductions ultimately benefiting both people and our planet.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The first race of the day proved to be the highlight of the day as the Bombers varsity 8 edged Mercyhurst by less than two seconds over the 2000m course. Canisius was 20 seconds back in third. Race #2 saw Ithaca handily beat Canisius by 45 seconds in the 2nd varsity 8. The four race was won by Mercyhurst over the Bombers by just over nine seconds.

In an effort to meet NCAA qualifying standards for the minimum number of competitions and to allow the athletes more opportunities to be on the water all three races were repeated double-header style 90 minutes later.

In the second go-round Mercyhurst turned the tables and beat the Bombers by eight seconds. The Ithaca Crew could not re-create the rhythm from their opening victory. The 2nd varsity 8 won again comfortably over Canisius. The Ithaca four avenged their earlier loss to Mercyhurst after the Lakers made a line-up change. The four won by 8 seconds.

After two weeks of racing the Ithaca varsity 8 finds itself with a record of 5-1. The second varsity 8 is 4-0. The four is 2-1. Next weekend the women's crews will host William Smith St. John Fisher and Nazareth on the Cayuga Inlet.

While many have been hit hard financially this past year others are able to help without sacrificing their own comfort and wellbeing. The Invitation to the Future is a way for those who can to demonstrate their belief in the global cultural importance of Burning Man and Black Rock City – a way to invest in the limitless possibilities of our co-created future.

The Burning Man community has always depended on each individual contributing when and how they are able trusting in the natural balance of the organism to shift rise and compensate as needed. It is on the strength of our beautifully varied backgrounds and lived experiences that the community must now rely more than ever. The Invitation to the Future is an expression of the extraordinary Communal Effort that will be required to continue offering the healing and inspiration of Burning Man to the world.

Where does this money go?

Running a global year-round arts nonprofit is a huge undertaking. Securing a reservation to the future allows us to continue the work of returning to Black Rock City safely. It’s our number one priority and what our entire staff (and we know many of you too!) wake up every day thinking about. We are also charged with supporting the global year-round Burning Man culture a responsibility we care about very deeply. Reservations to the future will enable Burning Man Project to both bring back Black Rock City and continue doing the important work of supporting and empowering our global community through our nonprofit programs.

Remember Burning Man Project doesn’t have corporate sponsors (see Decommodification) and ticket sales are normally 90% of our annual revenue. Over the course of 2020 we received gifts of $10 to $5000000 from more than 21000 generous amazing people to help us through the collective dust storm of the past year. We’ve heard loud and clear that people would like to show their support for the future of Burning Man by securing access to future tickets. Offering reservations to the future will give an opportunity to those wishing to support our future while also serving as an invitation for some to begin planning their next BRC adventure.

What about the 2021 Directed Group Sale and Main Sale?

Those of you who are part of the various Directed Group Sale (DGS) teams have already received notifications from the respective departments (Placement DMV Art) to submit your needs for 2021. Because of the many steps involved we have to continue preparations so we are ready to go if we can build BRC this year but we do not expect to be activating the DGS or other sales until closer to a “go” decision is made.

See you in the future!

Every year people journey from all over the world to hike bike and climb the rocky terrain or catch the spring wildflower bloom. And once night falls a completely different side of the park is revealed — dark skies full of stars.

Joshua Tree is the sort of place you'll want to spend at least a few nights. And the park makes RV camping just as easy (if not easier) as putting up a tent. There are RV campsites available throughout and many allow you to select and book a spot that fits your rig well in advance. Plus while tent camping can be fun the comfort of an RV in Joshua Tree's windy sun-drenched landscape is impossible to deny.

So whether you're a longtime RV owner or a newbie renting a rig from Outdoorsy here are some of the best RV campgrounds within Joshua Tree National Park.

Black Rock Campground

If you're looking for an in-park campsite with plenty of amenities reserve a spot at Black Rock Campground. While the campground doesn't have full RV hookups (they don't exist inside the park) you will have access to flush toilets a dump station and RV-accessible potable water — three things that can make an RV camping trip much easier. Plus if you need something it's an easy five-mile drive to the town of Yucca Valley.

Black Rock is located in the northwest corner of the park and has 99 campsites that can accommodate RVs and trailers up to 35 feet long. The park is open year-round but if you're planning to visit between the end of August and early June you'll need to reserve a site up to six months in advance at the nightly rate of $25.

Indian Cove Campground

Indian Cove Campground sits off of Highway 62 between the towns of Joshua Tree and Twentynine Palms. It may be easy to access but the campground's ambience and views aren't compromised — it sits among huge rock formations near several rock-climbing routes.

At Indian Cove you'll find 101 campsites reservable online during the busy winter season and on a predominantly first-come first-served basis from May to September. (Note: you can still book 39 of the 101 sites online during the summer.) The campground which can accommodate RVs up to 25 feet in length has vault toilets and no water (though potable water is available at the ranger station two miles away). The campsite rate is $20 per night.

White Tank Campground

White Tank Campground is the sort of place where you'll want to turn off your phone and tilt your head toward the starry sky. In addition to dark quiet nights White Tank sits among giant granite boulders perfect for daytime exploration.

The small campground has just 15 sites and can only accommodate RVs and trailers up to 25 feet long. There is no water dump station or flushing toilets (vault toilets only) so you'll want to come prepared and arrive early — camping at White Tank is first-come first-served year-round.

Cottonwood Campground

Like Black Rock Cottonwood Campground has more amenities than most other in-park options. You'll find potable water flush toilets and a dump station but keep in mind the nearest town — Indio — is about 30 miles away.

Located in the southern part of the park this campground is open year-round but it does limit the number of campsites in the less busy summer months. Reserve your campsite well in advance during the high season (late August to early June) since there are only 62 sites in Cottonwood and not all fit RVs. The RV-friendly sites typically accommodate an overall combined length (including a towed vehicle) of 35 feet while a few can fit even longer rigs. The nightly rate to camp at Cottonwood is $25.

Jumbo Rocks Campground

As you might guess Jumbo Rocks Campground sits among giant rounded boulders and impressive rock formations that give campers direct access to nature's jungle gym. It's a popular camping spot because of its central in-park location and otherworldly terrain. Plus it's open year-round and located between the towns of Twentynine Palms and Joshua Tree making last-minute grocery runs easy.

Jumbo Rocks has 124 campsites — some of which can accommodate RVs and trailers up to 35 feet — but it doesn't offer much in the way of amenities. There's no dump station or potable water access so come prepared. You can reserve your $20/night campsite online up to six months in advance.

Ryan Campground

This beautiful campground set among the park's iconic rock formations has 31 campsites which can accommodate RVs and trailers up to 35 feet in length. While Ryan Campground doesn't offer potable water or a dump station it is conveniently located next to the California Riding and Hiking Trail and close to Ryan Mountain and Cap Rock.

During most of the year you'll need to book your $20 a night campsite online and well in advance.

Hidden Valley Campground

If you have a smaller rig (25 feet max) and are comfortable with more off-the-grid camping — no flush toilets potable water or dump station — head to Hidden Valley. This beautiful year-round campground is surrounded by Joshua trees and giant boulders and is near Barker Dam and the Hidden Valley Nature Trail. Plus it's 14 miles from the town of Joshua Tree.

If you have your sights set on Hidden Valley arrive early — all 44 of the campsites are first-come first-served and cost $15 a night.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZTQyLmllL3RyYWlsYmxhemVycy1pcmlzaC13b21lbnMtcnVnYnktMS01NDA0NjkwLUFwcjIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'It was a lot of hard graft': The groundbreakers who paved the way for Irish women's rugby,"Trailblazers

""Tony!""

Tony was a 17 year-old senior who was first diagnosed with the terminal illness in October 2019. He died less than a year later on Jan. 14 2020.

Saturday's 48-0 victory over BMR-Hopedale was the first game at the Beavers' home field since Peña's passing and the first true home game for Blackstone Valley Tech since a Thanksgiving game with cross-street rival Nipmuc in 2019 in which Peña attended.

""I know for me personally it's something that I hold close to me"" BVT coach Jim Archibald said. ""Tony was a special kid and what he went through no one should have to go through and the courage that he showed through that really exemplifies what a good young man he was.""

For many of the 19 Blackstone Valley Tech seniors who were honored on Saturday as part of Senior Day festivities Peña's spirit still lives on.

""Everybody is playing for 5-4 (Tony's football number was 54)"" senior running back/defensive back Jack Fleming said. ""We love that kid. He was the heart and soul of this team. We love Tony and we play for him everyday.""

As a result the Beavers have decided to dedicate this season to Peña and honor him by breaking each huddle by yelling his name.

""We've kind of let the kids honor him how they choose"" Archibald said. ""We let them do their thing. It just speaks to what he meant to our program. Kids remember him and he stays with all of us everyday and it's the least that we could do to honor him.""

With how the Beavers played on Saturday Peña would have been proud.

BVT opened with a 18-yard touchdown pass from senior quarterback Angelo Cardarelli to senior tight end Sam DiColella just over two minutes into the game.

The following offensive drive senior running back Carl Muanaya finished with a 12-yard touchdown run to make it 14-0 with 4:19 left to play in the first quarter.

The Beavers weren't done scoring yet in the first quarter as senior running back Kyle Vaughan ran it in from six yards out to make it 21-0 Blackstone Valley Tech as time expired in the first quarter.

Blackstone Valley Tech would score two more times in the second quarter to make it 34-0 heading into the half.

Senior wide receiver Luke Malkasian scored on a two-yard touchdown run to make it 27-0 after a missed extra point.

Senior Cam Gallagher closed out the scoring in the first half with a three-yard touchdown run.

""Coming into the game (on Saturday) I wanted to get as many of those guys touchdowns ... as I could"" Archibald said. ""And I think they all got one. Luke got one Kyle Cam and Sam. Carl has been getting one every week so we wanted to mix it up a little bit and spread it around. I'm just happy for them.""

Sophomore running back Jayden Roderigues finished off the scoring with a pair of touchdown runs in the second half. Late in the third quarter Roderigues scored on a 19-yard touchdown run to make it 41-0 and in the fourth quarter the sophomore ran it in again this time from 43 yards out to make it 48-0.

""It feels good to share the love"" Fleming said. ""Everyone scoring and not just Carl but we were able to share the love everybody was able to score. Play well and even some of the younger guys got in there. Jayden got a couple so we played good. Line played good everyone was playing well.""

""We do everything for Tony right now"" senior lineman Liam Strom said. ""He's our motivation and we play for him.""

The request for nearly $6 million in public tax-increment financing would help cover eligible costs of the overall $37.7 million project at 3555 Farnam St.

TIF is an incentive that allows developers to use a portion of future increased property taxes generated by their projects to pay for certain upfront development costs. It’s designed to boost blighted areas and go toward projects that wouldn’t happen without the incentive.

Blackstone Plaza has retained a few tenants — including Warren Buffett and his Berkshire Hathaway corporate office — after Kiewit Corp. sold the property and ended a six-decade run there.

Kiewit now is settled into its newly built worldwide headquarters in north downtown Omaha.

Renovations have started at the Blackstone Plaza built in 1961. The new ownership group led by John Lund of the Lund Co. plans a complete modernization to usher in Class A office space with new windows interior redesign an open lobby and new public spaces including restaurants and retailers on the ground floor.

The group expects about 40 employees at the retail and event services in addition to 10 full-time building management staff.

According to city planning documents the ownership group hopes to attract a new-to-Omaha anchor employer as well as other business tenants.

Of the $37.7 million project cost $16 million was for the purchase of the property. The tax-increment financing request is for $5.99 million.

The City Planning Board last week gave its green light to the TIF proposal which now goes to the City Council.

×

Billionaire investor Mark Walter the owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers is staking a claim in Gunnison County.

A lot of claims actually.

The Chicago financier this year has quietly acquired six high-profile commercial properties including the Almont Resort and several iconic buildings in downtown Crested Butte that are home to restaurants bars and shops.

“I haven’t seen anything like this in my 43 years in Crested Butte but things are changing around here” said Doug Kroft who started selling real estate in the former mining town in the 1970s and recently retired. “I’m sure he’s got plans but he does not appear to be sharing them with anyone.”

Walter and his wife Kimbra have owned a relatively modest home in Mount Crested Butte since 2009. He bought the historic Grubstake Building on Crested Butte’s bustling Elk Avenue in 2011 for $766700.

×

This year using limited liability companies that are registered with the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office under his Chicago business address he paid $1.55 million for the Forest Queen building on Elk which was built in 1882 and is home to the Coal Creek Grill and an idled hotel.

He also purchased the Gunnison Savings and Loan Building at 501 Elk Ave. which is home to a bank a spa and a tattoo shop. And the Princess building at 218 Elk Ave. which houses the Princess Wine Bar. And Crested Butte’s first restaurant the Wooden Nickel.

×

Eric Roemer owned the Wooden Nickel for 40 years. He celebrated his final night at the restaurant last week. “I really don’t know what his plan is but it could be exciting” Roemer said. “He’s acquired some of the oldest buildings in town.”

Down valley where the East River joins the Taylor River Walter spent $6.3 million for Almont Resort a 60-acre riverfront compound of cabins homes and commercial buildings first established in 1893.

×

Walter also acquired a building with a health club and office space on Elk Avenue for $1.7 million and the undeveloped Sixth Street Station project for $5.5 million. The Sixth Street Station is a shovel-ready hotel retail and residential project the town approved in 2017. It ranks as the largest project ever greenlighted by Crested Butte.

The investment group that has shepherded Sixth Street Station hopes the hotel and homes will be built said Chris Kopf the broker who sold the downtown project.

“But you never know” Kopf said. “We still have projects in CB that were started then stopped during the downturn and financial crisis back in mid-2008 that have not yet been completed. But a benefit of COVID is people really appreciate the remote mountain town of Crested Butte. Given the buyer demand and ascending prices it should make it easier for developers to start new projects or restart old ones.”

Crested Butte like all resort communities in Colorado’s high country had a record-setting year for real estate sales in 2020. As urbanites flee cities for mountain enclaves many resort areas – such as Telluride Vail Aspen and Crested Butte – saw sales-dollar volume and home prices hit highs. The Crested Butte area saw 480 sales total $523 million in 2020 up from the previous record of 317 deals worth $227 million in 2019 according to market reports compiled by local broker Frank Konsella.

“It’s been a tough year for buyers and the sellers are in a good spot” Konsella said.

Walter’s buying spree in Crested Butte started in January but no broker has seen the coattail investors who typically follow heavyweights like Walter.

“That happened a bit when Vail bought the resort” Kroft said of Vail Resorts’ 2018 purchase of Crested Butte Mountain Resort and three other ski areas from the Mueller family’s Triple Peaks.

The Muellers for example sold their undeveloped acreage to an investor shortly after selling the ski area. The family also recently sold undeveloped homesites in the slopeside Prospect community but not to Walter.

Earlier this month Miami doctor Claudio Alvarez and his wife Yvonne unveiled possible ideas for 150 acres at the base of Snodgrass Mountain where the Mueller family had sketched plans for a base village and ski area connected to Crested Butte Mountain Resort. (The Forest Service rejected the ski area expansion in 2010.)

Alvarez this month told Crested Butte News Editor Mark Reaman his vision for the parcel includes a 10-acre campus for the nearby Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory and a mix of housing in “an eclectic community with lots of local people here.”

Walter is not the first wealthy financier to bet big in Gunnison County and downtown Crested Butte. Former Blackstone executive Chad Pike started acquiring and rebuilding historic properties in the town in the late aughts – including what is now the uber-luxury Scarp Ridge Lodge and Public House restaurant and music venue on Elk Avenue as well as a fishing lodge on the Taylor River and cabins near Lake Irwin. Pike spent almost a decade renovating his Gunnison County properties all of which support his high-end 13-property global adventure travel company Eleven Experience.

Tisha McElroy-Swan the broker who helped Walter assemble his Crested Butte portfolio said he did not share any insights about his plans for the buildings with her.

McElroy-Swan said Walter would not want to comment. He is according to a host of financial and news reports that mostly focus on his ownership of the Dodgers baseball team not a fan of the limelight. Locals in Crested Butte call him down to earth and low key.

Walter paid $2.15 billion for the Dodgers in 2012 and the 2020 World Series champions have the highest payroll in baseball. Guggenheim Partners his global investment firm controls $250 billion in investments. The Walter family also is big on wildlife protection with the Walter Conservation Foundation owning a 17000-acre endangered wildlife refuge in Florida as well as supporting species conservation and wildlife habitat protection in North America and Africa.

Considering his history of investments and the fact he is buying in Crested Butte at the height of the market it’s safe to assume Walter is not bargain-hunting for a quick flip.

“It’s a long-term play for him” McElroy-Swan said. “He’s a great guy and I know he will do great things to enrich our community.”

SEATTLE — About 220 Boeing employees voted Sunday to authorize a strike if a new contract agreement cannot be reached with their employer by April 17 at midnight.

Members of the Teamsters Local 174 the union representing Boeing employees met virtually Sunday and voted unanimously to authorize a strike.

The employees work in Transportation Warehousing and Logistics and Facilities and Asset Management for The Boeing Company. They are responsible for transporting aircraft engines fuselages and other aircraft parts as well as operating tankers involved in fueling and de-fueling aircraft according to a statement from the union.

Kevin Dahl has been a driver for nearly 34 years. ""I love it I love going to work every day. I love the Boeing company"" he said. Dahl maneuvers large plane parts through tricky drives all over the state.

""The traffic is terrible but we’re all professionals. We’ve [got the] safest driving record in the state for a private carrier we all love our jobs"" said Dahl.

A representative from the union said contract negotiations ""soured"" when Boeing executives came to the table with what seemed to be a ""philosophical refusal to acknowledge the skills and professionalism of their Teamster workforce.""

""Boeing has spent the last 20 years creating a work environment that includes outsourcing downsizing and elimination of the work our members perform all the while increasing management and executive bonuses to unbelievable heights"" said Teamsters Local 174 Secretary-Treasurer Rick Hicks in a statement. ""Now they are attempting to use their current self-inflicted situation to jam a sub-standard contract down the throats of our members. Our members will rise to that challenge.""

Jared Nelson is the union shop steward and said ""We work for a big company and we’re not going to get pushed around because we’re the little guys.""

​Deep-brain neurostimulation a procedure designed and tested in Grenoble in particular by Professor Benabid and practiced for 34 years has significantly reduced motor symptoms of 200000 people with Parkinson's disease worldwide. Clinatec the Edmond J. Safra Biomedical Research Center and a CEA laboratory based in Grenoble is working on a complementary practice through the NIR project.

Traditional deep-brain stimulation delivers a high-frequency electrical current to modulate neural targets which is pathologic in Parkinson's disease. In contrast near-infrared illumination targets the substantia nigra the site of the degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons that cause the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Unlike current therapies that temporarily limit symptoms without affecting the degeneration of neurons light could potentially halt degeneration of these neurons. Thus this therapeutic approach could slow down the loss of motor functions of patients and their autonomy.

Walden made a name for himself prosecuting mob cases out of New York and in 2015 co-founded a boutique law firm Walden Macht & Haran in Manhattan.

Miller worked for the Delaware Attorney General’s office then took his expertise handling whistleblower cases into private practice at Berger Montague.

Now the Temple alumni have notched a legal victory together as Walden’s firm expands to Philadelphia with Miller on board as a partner: The firm represented a whistleblower in a $75 million settlement with a major pharmaceutical company announced April 1 by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

The case was more than seven years in the making and alleged that Bristol Myers Squibb underpaid rebates it owed to Medicaid programs which are supposed to help lower the government’s costs of prescription drugs. A company spokesperson said it denies that any wrongdoing occurred and “acted responsibly” in interpreting complex regulations.

“Were it not for whistleblowers there’s a lot of fraud and corruption that would never get exposed and they take very serious risks” said Walden who served as special counsel on a New Jersey investigation of corporate tax breaks and whose client Grigory Rodchenkov blew the whistle on state-sponsored doping in Russian sports. “From our perspective it’s all about making government function as fairly and as effectively as possible.”

Whistleblower complaints — also known as “qui tam” cases — are the government’s biggest source of financial settlements and judgments under the False Claims Act. In its fiscal year 2020 the U.S. Department of Justice recovered $2.2 billion under that law and nearly $1.7 billion stemmed from whistleblower suits most of it related to the health-care industry. A whistleblower usually stands to collect 15% to 30% of the amount recovered.

The 672 qui tam suits filed last year marked a three-year high though it’s still below the peak of 757 whistleblower complaints filed in 2013 according to Justice Department statistics.

Bringing on Miller “supersized” the firm’s whistleblower practice Walden said. In one case potentially worth $1.5 billion their suit alleges that a pharmaceutical company misled the U.S. Food and Drug Administration about defects in cardiac implantable devices. The firm also has more than two dozen qui tam suits filed under seal.

Government spending on health care is an evergreen target for fraud. “The budget each year no matter what administration is in charge is over $1 trillion for Medicaid and Medicare alone” said Miller a past president of the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units. “So whenever you have that kind of money floating around there are going to be people who try and take it.”

Walden who grew up in Levittown had long envisioned Philly as the first site for the firm’s expansion. “All of my formative legal experiences started in Philadelphia” he said. Miller was a year behind him at Temple law and they played on the law school’s rugby club together.

In October 2019 Miller left Berger Montague and briefly struck out on his own. He was talking to Walden one day and recalls his friend saying “I want to build a Philadelphia office. Let’s start with you.”

In January 2020 the firm leased office space in Center City at 20th and Market. Then came the pandemic leaving Miller working from home as members of the New York office worked remotely as well.

The firm currently numbers 39 lawyers and 18 staffers. Walden didn’t specify how many people they plan to hire in Philadelphia though he and Miller anticipate leasing a larger space in Philly later this spring. “We’re looking for talented people with a very clear eye on diversity and we’ll grow to the size that makes sense” Walden said.

In the qui tam practice area it helps to work in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania because prosecutors here have a reputation for handling sophisticated cases Miller said and “working cooperatively with whistleblowers” who are also referred to as “relators” in legal-speak.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Philadelphia has recovered more than $6 billion from False Claims Act cases since the 1990s — a figure that encompasses blockbuster settlements in the pharmaceutical industry.

“There’s absolutely no substitute for a whistleblower who has first-hand knowledge of how a scheme was carried out” said Gregory David the office’s civil division chief. Particularly in the last three years “we’ve made a real effort to get the relator’s attorneys’ perspective and to think about ways we can work together collaboratively.”

In addition to its 29 civil assistant U.S. Attorneys the office also devotes staffing to false claims cases that includes three full-time auditors two investigators and a paralegal who is a certified fraud examiner along with other litigation consultants and support.

“We’re one of the few districts that has those resources” said Charlene Fullmer the civil division deputy chief. The office welcomes initial meetings with whistleblowers she said and once a qui tam is filed in the Eastern District “it’s a no-stone-unturned approach.”

In False Claims Act (FCA) cases a whistleblower typically begins working with a private lawyer first and government prosecutors then decide whether to pursue the case themselves.

If the government declines the whistleblower has a choice: Walk away or stick with the case.

Miller has often chosen to stick with it in those instances — even though a much smaller portion of FCA whistleblower awards result from cases prosecutors declined. Last year such cases made up 11.4% of the Justice Department’s qui tam recoveries.

“One of the things he does best is to take those cases and keep pursuing them even when the government doesn’t want to be the plaintiff” Walden said. “And he’s had some extraordinary results.”

Take the Bristol Myers settlement. The suit was first filed in 2013 and prosecutors declined to intervene in 2017. Miller’s client Ronald Streck forged ahead anyway and the federal government and states will reap the funds. It was Miller’s 10th FCA settlement in a case the government had previously declined.

The cardiac medical device case “is a perfect example where we’re picking up where the government left off” Miller said. That suit is pending in federal court in Minnesota. The plaintiff is a physician who alleges that Boston Scientific knew its cardiac defibrillator devices had serious defects before winning FDA approval in 2008 blamed problems on doctors’ techniques and sold the devices until regulators issued a recall in 2009.

Boston Scientific has denied those allegations in court papers. The company did not respond to a request for comment.

Miller has been working on the case for 10 years. A verdict in the case could be worth $1.5 billion the firm said. But if their side loses they could end up with zero for a decade’s worth of work.

“You try and make good judgements on the facts and the law” Miller said and pursue enough cases so “that the ones that succeed are large enough to allow you to keep doing the good work.”",,,,,,,,,

Boston University Statehouse Program

BOSTON — A bill extending workplace protections for domestic violence survivors working in contract jobs is aimed a closing a loophole that allowed a woman to be put out of a job after she missed work to recover from domestic violence injuries according to sponsors Sen. Ryan C. Fattman R-Sutton and Rep. Joseph D. McKenna R-Webster.

The current state labor law allows for a leave of absence of 15 days for direct employees who were victims of domestic violence. It does not extend to contracted workers such as Amanda Dabrowski who was fatally stabbed in 2019 by her former partner Carlos Asencio at O’Connor’s Restaurant & Bar in Worcester.

“The bill came about from such a tragic situation” Fattman said. “A lovely family loses one of their daughters and I would argue strongly that had this law been in place there’s a chance she wouldn’t go through that downward spiral.

“Losing her job had tremendous consequences on her life” he added. “Her family paid the consequences for it and it’s unacceptable.”

Asencio allegedly attacked Dabrowski on April 21 2019. As she was recovering from her extensive injuries Dabrowski missed two days of work at Bristol-Myers Squibb in Devens where she was working through a temporary agency. She was dismissed on April 23. Less than three months later Asencio allegedly fatally stabbed Dabrowski.

“After Dabrowski was assaulted in her house with a deadly weapon the company terminated her contract” he added. “We’re seeking to patch up that loophole and protect temporary employees that might be involved in domestic violence that inhibits them from working temporarily.”

Dabrowski’s father told the Telegram & Gazette that his daughter could have used the 15 days leave of absence “to get her life back together” after she was attacked but “was never given that opportunity.”

Deborah Hall director of domestic violence services at YWCA Central Massachusetts said that the organization supports the extension of workplace protections to contracted workers.

“It’s a no-brainer” Hall said. “That safety net should be provided. When you can’t go to work you can’t go to work.

“On top of the abuse being scared of losing your job makes the situation even worse” she added. “When you’re a survivor you have to uproot and change your life so it’s important to keep that thing that was consistent – your job.”

Hema Sarang-Sieminski policy director at Jane Doe Inc. the Massachusetts Coalition Against Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence said that survivors should be able to take time off without fear that their economic security will be jeopardized.

“Whether it’s accessing medical care or getting a restraining order survivors need to carve out a number of hours during traditional business hours to begin that very long healing process” Sarang-Sieminski said.

Under the current law an employer cannot terminate an employee for missing work because of domestic violence injury. But Dabrowski wasn’t fired; instead Bristol-Myers didn’t renew her contract through the temporary employment agency.

“The company terminated her contract and I would argue that they essentially fired her” Fattman said. “Because when you look at her performance evaluations and see that her contract had been extended and she was given a raise it’s clear she was doing great.”

The proposed legislation would define what a temporary worker is and cover them under the law.

Fattman said the bill was urgent in light of the pandemic as new stresses brought about by job losses and lockdowns may lead to an increase in domestic violence.

“Certain stressors that weren’t there pre-pandemic were put on society” he said. “Domestic violence incidents happen when people’s lives are upended and there are new stressors like losing your job schools shutting down and kids staying home or caring for a loved one who is sick.”

McKenna agreed and said the bill was relevant in light of the isolation survivors found themselves in during the pandemic.

“We need to shine a light on the issue” he said. “People are at home in close quarters and unable to leave their abuser so the bill becomes incredibly pertinent in this situation.”

Fattman said the bill had gotten support but the pandemic shut down the legislative process just days after the legislation was filed in March. In November 2019 the two lawmakers met with the chairwoman of the Legislature’s Committee on Labor and Workforce Development as well as the Senate President and the Speaker of the House.

“We got momentum and endorsements but with COVID-19 everything public health-related got more attention so the bill got sidetracked” he said. “Now we’re doubling down to make sure this legislation passes.”

McKenna said he discussed the bill with temporary employment agencies and business advocacy groups including the Associated Industries of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts chapter of the National Federation of Independent Businesses who said they wouldn’t oppose the bill.

“My concern was that they would see the bill as an encroachment on businesses operating in the way they see fit” he said. “Our conversations were productive and they didn’t see this as an affront. It’s truly about getting victims the protections they deserve.”

“In honor of Amanda’s life and to prevent this sort of tragedy we’re trying to do what we can to make sure every worker has the same protections” he added. “Domestic violence survivors don’t need to be victimized twice once from the assault and once from unfair employment laws.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy93aGlzdGxlYmxvd2VyLXF1aS10YW0tY2FzZXMtZnJhdWQtaGVhbHRoLWNhcmUtZHJ1Z3MtZGV2aWNlcy1waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEtMjAyMTA0MTEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A NYC boutique law firm expands to Philly betting on growth in whistleblower cases,"After graduating from Temple Law School in the early 1990s friends Jim Walden and Dan Miller followed separate career paths — while keeping up joint family vacations at the Shore.

Brown won the hearts of millions during her season on ""The Bachelorette"" which aired in the summer of 2019.

She's now taken her skills to the publishing world with the release of her first novel ""Mistakes We Never Made"" which goes on sale on Tuesday May 7.

CALLING ALL BOOK LOVERS: HERE ARE THE TOP 10 CITIES FOR THOSE WHO LOVE TO READ

Fox News Digital spoke by Zoom with the 29-year-old originally from Tuscaloosa Alabama ahead of her book's release to talk about all things Emma and Finn her main characters.

""I’m so excited about this book because it’s truly like a dream come true"" she said.

A proud graduate of the University of Alabama Brown received a bachelor’s degree in communication studies and worked as an interior designer before going on ""The Bachelor"" as a contestant in 2019.

VACATION DESTINATIONS ARE OFTEN CHOSEN FROM POPULAR BOOKS ON THE SHELF STUDY SAYS: SEE IF YOU'VE READ THESE

The TV personality shifted gears after her lead season of ""The Bachelorette"" later in 2019 — even writing a memoir and becoming a New York Times bestselling author in 2021.

She said she’s always loved to read and write but this process was very different from writing her memoir ""God Bless This Mess.""

""It was very different. I would say ‘God Bless This Mess’ was hard because it was a very cathartic experience — it’s hard sharing your story and [wondering] how people will perceive you"" she said.

""When it came to ‘Mistakes We Never Made’ it was a lot more challenging [than knowing] the plot points in my own life [as] I experience them. But how do you create a totally fictitious world [with] characters? That takes a lot of organizing and plotting.""

""I have a pretty good gut instinct for what’s working and what’s not.""

The romance novel's two main characters go from ""frenemies to lovers"" during a ""wild-goose chase"" to find a missing bride ahead of her wedding.

TORONTO WOMAN TAKES NOVEL APPROACH TO DATING BY STAMPING HANDS AT BARS: ‘YOU’RE CUTE YOU SHOULD HIT ME UP'

Brown won FOX's ""Special Forces: World's Toughest Test"" in 2023.

She took some of her favorite things she said and put them in the novel — describing her book as ""The Hangover"" meets ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" meets ""When Harry Met Sally.""

""I definitely drew inspiration from things I love about different things I’ve read or watched or seen in some way and was really inspired by those aspects of what I enjoy"" she said.

Brown said the two-year writing process was a ""brand-new thing"" for her.

""That’s what makes it a lot harder because I’m still trying to figure it out as I go but I feel very confident in this first book because I had a lot of pros helping me along the way"" she said.

‘BACHELOR’ COUPLE SHARES THE UNEXPECTED MOMENT AT THEIR EUROPEAN WEDDING THAT LEFT THE BRIDE ‘BAWLING’

The Nashville resident got engaged to her fiancé Adam Woolard in August 2023 after over two years of dating.

Brown said through the writing process of ""Mistakes We Never Made"" she learned that she has ""pretty good gut instincts.""

""Like anybody starting something new you can get imposter syndrome as in ‘Why am I doing this?’ and ‘Why do I think I can do this?’ What I have learned about myself is I do have a pretty good gut instinct for what’s working and what’s not.""

""People ask me [if] Finn’s based on any guy in my life and I’m like ‘Finn is definitely part of the people in my life' — but also Finn’s part of me.""

She added ""When it comes to the big picture and seeing a full world and really understanding these characters thoughts feelings and emotions how they could respond react … I have a pretty good instinct for that.""

Brown said that while the book is a work of fiction she sees herself in different parts of the main character Emma.

""For me personally I don’t think I can write anything that’s not based on some type of truth. I can’t write a character that I’ve never experienced"" she said.

She added ""People ask me [if] Finn’s based on any guy in my life and I’m like ‘Finn is definitely part of the people in my life' — but also Finn’s part of me.""

As pro-Palestinian protests have spread across college campuses nationwide two key demands have emerged: that colleges disclose how endowment funds are invested and that they divest from weapons manufacturers and other businesses profiting off of the war in Gaza.

Student stipulations vary by campus often going beyond disclosure and divestment but those two themes are universal. And while national news coverage focuses on the use of force to clear encampments violent clashes with police and protester arrests it belies the fact that some colleges are making negotiations on these demands.

The concessions so far are limited. Administrators have promised little if anything at all. But engaging with student protesters has offered leadership a salve to campus chaos through agreements with demonstrators to remove encampments in exchange for action. In some cases a mere promise to consider protesters’ concerns has been enough to unwind the camps.

Colleges Making Concessions

Brown University has arguably taken the biggest step in striking a deal with protesters who folded up their tents in exchange for face time with board members to make a pitch for divesting from companies profiting off the war. A divestment vote is scheduled for October.

“I hope the meeting between the students and Corporation members will allow for a full and frank exchange of views” Brown President Christina Paxson wrote in an April 30 message to campus. “As I shared with the protesting students in my letter yesterday the devastation and loss of life in the Middle East has prompted many to call for meaningful change while also raising real issues about how best to accomplish this. Brown has always prided itself on resolving differences through dialog debate and listening to each other.”

Student protesters celebrated the moment noting the vote marks a historic first at Brown.

“VICTORY!! BROWN COMMITS TO DIVESTMENT VOTE!” the Brown Divest Coalition wrote as part of a social media post that credited the role protesters played in forcing the deal.

Elsewhere Northwestern University has agreed to reestablish an Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility which will include student faculty and staff representatives and provide funding for both Palestinian students and visiting faculty members among other moves.

The decision to consider protesters’ demands provoked quick reprimand from Congressional Republicans. On Monday Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina the chairwoman of the House Education and Workforce Committee announced that the presidents of Northwestern and Rutgers University (which also agreed to listen to protesters’ demands) will now be part of a hearing on campus antisemitism alongside University of California Los Angeles Chancellor Gene Block. Originally the presidents of the University of Michigan and Yale University had been on the hook.

“Over the last several days the presidents of Northwestern and Rutgers have made shocking concessions to the unlawful antisemitic encampments on their campuses” Foxx said in a statement. “They have surrendered to antisemitic radicals in despicable displays of cowardice. As a result of these gravely concerning actions the Committee believes it’s necessary to reevaluate the scope of the May 23 hearing and bring in the presidents of Northwestern and Rutgers—along with UCLA—to testify before the Committee” she said noting Yale and Michigan will provide testimony at a later date.

At least two other public institutions have joined Rutgers in considering divestment demands.

Evergreen State College and the University of Minnesota have also struck agreements with pro-Palestinian protesters. None of the agreements promise concrete action but rather offer consideration of divestment proposals in exchange for removing the encampments. Students at Minnesota will also discuss divestment with the Board of Regents on Friday.

The University of Vermont has disclosed its investments as part of an agreement with students but has not agreed to weigh divestment.

Defending Decisions

Engaging in dialogue with protesters stands in stark contrast to the responses at Emory University and the University of Texas at Austin where demonstrators were met with tear gas and pepper spray. Neither institution responded to requests for information about possible negotiations with students.

But no matter which approach they’ve taken presidents have sought to justify their actions.

Leaders meeting with student activists have largely cast the decision as a reasonable response to constituent demands while also noting that the encampments violated university policies allowing them to emphasize order while striking a compromise with demonstrators. Some have used the moment to denounce any antisemitism they see connected to the protests.

“I recognize that some slogans and expressions are open to interpretation. But when I see a Star of David with an X on it when I see a picture of me with horns or when I hear that one of our students has been called a dirty Jew there is no ambiguity. This needs to be condemned by all of us and that starts with me” Northwestern President Michael Schill said last week in a video statement in which he announced the agreement and condemned hateful rhetoric.

Other presidents however have defended decisions which have led to violent arrests.

“We have watched with concern as disruptive and illegal encampments have sprung up on other university campuses and we took seriously the pre-protest threats—voiced by organizers and others with no affiliation with UT—to ‘occupy’ our own” UT-Austin President Jay Hartzell wrote in an opinion piece for the Houston Chronicle. “As university leaders we recognized that at other schools encampments have preceded further and more serious disruptions safety risks injuries and ultimately more severe and dangerous police intervention. Also if we allowed encampments in this instance it would be nearly impossible to stop encampments from other groups in the future without facing challenges of chilling speech or viewpoint discrimination.”

University of Florida president Ben Sasse a former Republican Senator from Nebraska defended UF’s decision to arrest pro-Palestinian demonstrators in an interview with CNN on Sunday while also chiding other college leaders for their decision to engage with students.

“What you see happening on so many campuses across the country is instead of drawing the line at speech and action a lot of universities bizarrely give the most attention and most voice to the smallest angriest group. And it’s just not what we’re going to do here” Sasse told CNN.

Weighing Demands

To engage or arrest protesters is a choice many college leaders have faced in recent weeks as dozens of pro-Palestinian encampments have cropped up coast-to-coast leading to a spiraling clash between students and officials.

In more than two weeks of protests at least 2000 demonstrators have reportedly been arrested.

Mary Papazian executive vice president of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges identifies the two responses—meeting directly with protesters or arresting them—as two points at opposite ends of a response spectrum. But she believes presidents can operate in the middle engaging protesters indirectly and keeping order without mass arrests depending on the situation.

She notes however that the safety of the campus community should be paramount and that presidents frequently operate off facts that may not be available to the public or the press.

“A president has to be concerned about the safety of all stakeholders all representatives of the institution of all students. Violence and destruction of property really changes the conversation” Papazian said.

She also cautioned administrators against overreacting lest they “unnecessarily create more violence” such as in the anti-Vietnam War protests of the 1960s and early 1970s that included student fatalities most famously in the Kent State University shootings in which the Ohio National Guard gunned down unarmed students.

Roderick A. Ferguson who teaches women’s gender and sexuality studies and American studies at Yale University and has written a book on student activism told Inside Higher Ed by email that the current campus protests call for engaged leadership by college presidents.

“The role of a president in moments like this should be to engage with students and to uphold the ideals of academic freedom and inquiry. The president after all represents the various constituencies on a campus and the long-held principles that found universities and colleges” he wrote. Presidents “should be able to tie those academic principles to constitutional rights—particularly rights of assembly free speech the press petitioning the government for redress” he added.

Ferguson disputed the notion that presidents shouldn’t engage with protesters.

“There is no good argument and no standard of real leadership that eschews engagement with our students. Particularly in the context of student protests not engaging them typically means engaging the police. Engaging the police is where the conditions of life-threatening violence typically take place” Ferguson wrote.

But what happens before a campus protest reaches the point of crisis is key.

Specifically Papazian believes that universities need to have established trust and lines of communication between the administration and campus community members. She argues that colleges also need policies in place that guide how to respond to dynamic situations rather than hammering out new campus protocols amid an unexpected issue.

And regardless of what decision a president makes on encampment protests they should be able to explain what led to their decision and discuss their positions clearly and transparently Papazian argues.

“There has to be clarity about whatever action it is that the president takes. There may be good reasons for it but it has to be articulated and explained clearly and consistently” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNzcG9ydHMuY29tL25mbC9wcm9mb290YmFsbHRhbGsvcnVtb3ItbWlsbC9uZXdzL2JlbmdhbHMtc2VuaW9yLXBlcnNvbm5lbC1leGVjdXRpdmUtdHJleS1icm93bi1kZWNsaW5lcy1wYXRyaW90cy1pbnRlcnZpZXctcmVxdWVzdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bengals senior personnel executive Trey Brown declines Patriots' interview request,"The Patriots have begun the search to hire a new football operations chief.

""There are way too many differences right now so it's somewhat confusing for the novice fan.""The NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel adopted three significant rule changes for 2024 that have been in place in the NFL for many years.Beginning this fall teams will be able to use coach-to-player communications via radio transmitters in helmets to an offensive and defensive player on the field. Those players will be identified by having a green dot on the back midline of their helmet.Brown said they have been experimenting with the new communications system for a while now in practice in anticipation of the rule change.""(During the spring game) we were really vanilla with it"" he said. ""We used it in the bowl game and we've used it the last two springs so it's not necessarily new to us but we're using a different company now. I think it's going to help the game. It's going to help defenses as well. People are kind of underestimating that but it's really going to help the defenses.""West Virginia's middle linebackers have been using the helmet communications system but Brown indicated that it's still to be determined who will use it in the games this fall. Overall he believes helmet communications will alleviate some of the sloppiness that can take place on the sidelines.""If you feel like a team really has your signals it gives you some options on how you want to communicate"" he noted.NFL teams have been communicating with quarterbacks via helmets since 1994 and NFL defenders have been doing so since 2008.Tablets will also be permitted this year on the sidelines to view in-game video only. The video can include the game broadcast feed and camera angles from the sideline and the end zone.Up to 18 active tablets for use in the coaching booth sideline and locker room will be permitted. They cannot be connected to projection devices and cannot include analytics data or data accessing capabilities.Another rule synonymous with the NFL is the two-minute warning its origins dating back to the early days of the league when game time was kept by a member of the officiating crew on the field. Its function was to serve as a checkpoint to make sure both teams were aware of the time remaining in the game.When television became prominent in the late 1960s and early 1970s the two-minute warning took on more significance as a means of building drama for the conclusion of the game.College football is adopted a two-minute warning as a method of synchronizing end-of-game timing rules according to secretary-rules editor Steve Shaw. It will also help avoid consecutive media time outs at the conclusions of each half.""I think it's great for the officials and clock operators because the rules change under two minutes so it's a good reminder for them"" Brown said. ""There is going to be some strategy involved from a coaching perspective. Do you take a timeout before the two-minute warning?""The two-minute warnings at the end of the second and fourth quarters will not be an additional timeout but rather serves as fixed stopping points when television will know it can take media breaks."

Associated Press

ATLANTIC CITY N.J. — The coronavirus outbreak sent profits plunging at Atlantic City’s casinos by more than 80% last year according to figures released Friday by New Jersey gambling regulators.

But despite those dismal numbers seven of the nine casinos still managed to eke out a profit no matter how small in 2020.

The state Division of Gaming Enforcement reported the nine casinos collectively posted $117.5 million in gross operating profits in 2020. That was down from nearly $594 million a year earlier before the pandemic forced casinos to close for 3 1/2 months and limited their operations even after reopening.

Gross operating profit reflects earnings before interest taxes depreciation and other expenses and is a widely accepted measure of profitability in the Atlantic City casino industry.

“Atlantic City and its casinos endured their most challenging year in history” said James Plousis chair of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. Even after being allowed to reopen in July the casinos’ earnings were limited by travel restrictions limited amenities and canceled entertainment he added.

“Yet through responsible management the casinos proved that in-person gaming could happen safely” Plousis said. “As tourists return to the shore they can have every confidence Atlantic City is safe for the summer.”

The Ocean Casino Resort posted the largest operating profit at $21.8 million up from $6.7 million in 2019. Its owners announced this week that the Ilitch family of Detroit which owns the Little Caesars pizza chain pro baseball and hockey teams and a Detroit casino is buying half of the Ocean casino.

Ocean was the only Atlantic City casino to increase its profits during the pandemic year.

“Despite 2020’s extraordinary challenges Ocean showed continued growth emerging as an industry leader in gross gaming revenue” Terry Glebocki Ocean’s CEO said in a statement. “Thanks to our team’s hard work and determination in the months before and after our temporary closure due to the global pandemic Ocean had a successful year. As restrictions ease and we reopen additional areas of our business I’m optimistic we’ll continue to see gaming growth throughout 2021.”

The Tropicana earned $18.7 million but that was down more than 78% from a year earlier. Hard Rock earned $10.9 million down nearly 72% and Caesars earned $10.4 million down more than 84%.

Harrah’s earned $8.5 million down more than 90%; Golden Nugget earned $7.2 million down nearly 74% and the Borgata posted an operating profit of just $650000 for the year down 99.7% from 2019. It was the last Atlantic City casino to reopen last year several weeks after the rest.

Resorts had an operating loss of $10.5 million compared to a profit of $17.6 million in 2019. Resorts is in the process of extending its management agreement with the Mohegan tribe in Connecticut to manage its Atlantic City casino operations.

Bally’s had a $10 million operating loss compared to a $27.5 million profit in 2019.

Among internet-only entities Resorts Digital had an operating profit of over $21 million up from $8.5 million in 2019. Caesars Interactive Entertainment-NJ had a profit of nearly $20 million up more than 45% and Golden Nugget Online Gaming which was spun off last year showed an $18.6 million profit.

For the fourth quarter of 2020 whose results also were released Friday Atlantic City’s casinos reported a collective gross operating profit of $57.8 million down over 53% from 2019.

Ocean also had the most expensive average hotel room rate in 2020 at nearly $202. The Borgata was a distant second at $160.

Resorts had the lowest average room rate at $101 followed by Hard Rock at $112.

Ocean also had the highest occupancy rate in 2020 at 84%. The city as a whole averaged nearly 62% occupancy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1jb2x1bW5zL2luc2lkZS1nYW1pbmcvbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXRvdXJpc20taW5kdXN0cnktaG9wZWZ1bC1hZnRlci1icnV0YWwtNHRoLXF1YXJ0ZXItMjMyNjYzMi_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV2aWV3am91cm5hbC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYnVzaW5lc3MtY29sdW1ucy9pbnNpZGUtZ2FtaW5nL2xhcy12ZWdhcy10b3VyaXNtLWluZHVzdHJ5LWhvcGVmdWwtYWZ0ZXItYnJ1dGFsLTR0aC1xdWFydGVyLTIzMjY2MzIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas tourism industry hopeful after brutal 4th quarter,"Executives of the Southern Nevada’s publicly traded gaming and tourism companies would just as soon forget about their fourth-quarter earnings reports.

Say hello to curling the next competitive sport in Las Vegas

Executives of the Southern Nevada’s publicly traded tourism companies would just as soon forget about their fourth-quarter earnings reports.

But they also have a lot to look forward to in future earnings seasons.

Just as government leaders and health-care professionals have asked the public to be patient about a return to normalcy so must the casino airline and gaming equipment manufacturing companies that represent the local tourism economy.

In the fourth quarter nine of the 21 public companies the Review-Journal business staff monitors reported fourth-quarter profits totaling $716.5 million.

The bad news was that the losses for the other 12 companies came in at an estimated $2.553 billion.

Frankly the first quarter of 2021 isn’t likely to be much to write home about either considering that capacity restrictions will remain in place through at least May 1.

With capacity restrictions still in place Southern Nevada resorts haven’t been able to generate much revenue in their casinos showrooms restaurants and other amenities.

Signs of resurgence

But look at what we have to look forward to in the second half of 2021.

It appears that after a rough start vaccination rates appear to be on track. While having the public receiving their full doses of Pfizer Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines won’t be a cure-all it should instill confidence in people to get back to what they enjoy doing in our resorts.

Casino companies have organized vaccination programs for their employees and even though some may believe they’ve been coerced into doing so by regulators the end result is the same: It’ll convince visitors from afar that Las Vegas is a safe place to go for a good time.

Last week sales representatives from the city’s major casino companies gathered in the Las Vegas Convention Center’s new $989 million West Hall for a panel discussion on the return of the convention business.

The gathering — properly socially distanced with attendees wearing facial coverings — was generally upbeat with journalists from meetings trade publications optimistic about the return of conventions and shows in Las Vegas.

Local elected officials and International Market Centers leaders held a Friday ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the grand opening of the new 315000-square-foot Expo at World Market Center in advance of the five-day Las Vegas Market show.

The event opening Sunday in downtown Las Vegas will be one of the initial events to return since the COVID-19 pandemic started more than a year ago.

In early June the first major trade show and expo — World of Concrete — will make its appearance which should generate some second-quarter revenue for several companies. Representatives of Wynn Resorts Ltd. Caesars Entertainment Inc. Las Vegas Sands Corp. and MGM Resorts International are saying their convention calendars are starting to fill up.

Panelists said their companies have been investing in their products during the time there have been fewer people in their buildings.

Trains planes and automobiles

Attendees of Global Meetings Industry Day were given tours of the new West Hall and media members also got their first look at Elon Musk’s underground people-mover transit system using Tesla electric cars. It’s an attraction that for now is unique to Las Vegas and could draw interest from tourists when The Boring Co. expands the system into the city.

And the recent announcement that Amtrak could return to Las Vegas is welcome news especially to those who have spent untold hours sitting in traffic on Interstate 15 between Southern California and Las Vegas.

Assuming that President Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan includes new side tracks for Amtrak trains to get around priority freight trains a Los Angeles-to-Las Vegas train route could take thousands of cars off the overused highway. Amtrak could also produce some competition for Brightline’s planned high-speed rail project between Southern California and Southern Nevada.

Planes are starting to fill up again as well which is more good news for the city’s resorts.

While first-quarter results for Southwest Airlines and Allegiant Travel Co. aren’t likely to be anything to write home about they’re bound to be a good starting point for the rest of 2021.

Southwest the busiest commercial air carrier at McCarran International Airport and Las Vegas Sands Corp. parent company of The Venetian and the Palazzo are due to be the first to share their earnings with investors toward the end of April.

Both had disappointing fourth quarters but both have expressed optimism in the months ahead.

Southwest’s planes are starting to fill up and the company has announced 17 new destinations including Fresno Palm Springs and Santa Barbara California. The airline also has ordered 100 Boeing 737 MAX jets and will retire the oldest jets in its fleet.

Meanwhile more and more restaurants and entertainment venues are starting to open up to larger crowds. It was announced late last week that the Electric Daisy Carnival will be conducted in May as planned. That huge electronic music festival will bring thousands of people from out of state to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway for three evenings of entertainment.

The only thing that could ruin everything is a setback in COVID-19 cases resulting from overconfident and overexuberent people who refuse to adhere to health guidelines on social distancing and wearing masks.

Investors in publicly traded gaming companies are counting on visitors doing the right thing so that we can all get back to normal.

View the current offers here.

One constant of the pandemic has been a never-ending news stream from the wonderful world of Disney.

Parks closing parks re-opening (basically before any other travel or attraction) changes in the guest/park experience and now how the parks will deal with the pent-up demand of Disneyholics. It may sound crazy to head to a busy theme park in a pandemic but thanks to Disney's rules and procedures it's actually a pretty solid choice.

With my vaccinations complete I'm again headed to Orlando this July to meet a couple of other families for some solid Disney exploration and adventure. A trip to Disney World can easily cost thousands of dollars and can be a difficult trip to complete in its entirety on points and miles especially if you like to stay on Disney property.

But I love a good challenge. So here is a recap of how I'm covering the cost of travel tickets and food at Disney World using just my credit card reward points and perks.

Capital One Venture Miles for tickets and campsite

There are very few good options to get great value out of your points and miles for Disney tickets but Capital One Venture Miles from my Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card (currently available with a large limited-time welcome bonus) is a rare example where you can get the desired value out of your rewards.

With Capital One's ability to redeem miles to essentially wipe out travel charges you make to the card you can use Venture Miles to cover any travel expense charged to the card at a rate of one cent per mile. Since you earn 2x Venture Miles on all purchases this is equivalent to using a 2% cashback card to cover your Disney expenses.

For lodging I'll again be driving my RV down to Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground.

We stayed for a week last fall and found the campground to be such a fun Disney experience. It also happens to be the most affordable on-property location though still quite expensive as far as campgrounds go. The campground will cost me about $350 for three nights requiring me to use 35000 Venture Miles to erase the charge.

When it comes to park tickets there is one important note to make here: Disney tickets purchased directly from Disney by themselves do not count as travel and therefore cannot be erased. (They usually do when purchased as part of a larger lodging and ticket package.)

However Disney tickets bought from UndercoverTourist.com do traditionally count as a travel charge and you'll be able to erase the purchase with your Venture Miles.

For my dates this summer the three-day Disney Theme Park Base Ticket will cost $378.91 requiring me to redeem 37 891 Venture Miles to erase the charge. This puts the cost of my lodging and ticket at around 72000 Venture Miles and $0 out of pocket.

The Venture Rewards card currently comes with its highest-ever sign-up bonus: 100000 bonus miles after spending $20000 on the card within the first 12 months of account opening. This is awarded in two installments.

First you can still earn 50000 miles after you spend $3000 in purchases within the first three months of account opening. The second set of 50000 miles is awarded with a total of $20000 in spending in the first year on the card.

I recently picked up the Capital One Venture Rewards card for both my wife and me meaning with 200000 welcome bonus miles plus the miles earned to meet the minimum spend I'm happy redeeming 70000 of them to help make Disney free as far as my wallet is concerned.

Amex Platinum PayPal credits for Disney gift cards

At the start of January 2021 American Express unveiled a new temporary perk for The Platinum Card® from American Express cardmembers: an up to $30 monthly PayPal statement credit. Amex has automatically issued these monthly statement credits for eligible PayPal purchases that I've charged each month.

When I first heard about the PayPal credit I immediately thought of one of my favorite discount gift card websites that I know accepts PayPal: cardcash.com.

While I typically buy discounted gift cards from the site they also sell new gift cards for just about any amount including brand-new Disney gift cards you can order for exactly $30.

When you select checkout with PayPal a pop-up window will show you your linked cards including your personal Platinum Card from American Express which specifically tells you about the PayPal credit right on the pop-up:

Both my wife and I carry a personal Amex Platinum card and this is how I've been using each of our monthly credits.

With $60 in free-to-me Disney gift cards coming in every month by my July trip I'll have $360 in Disney gift cards saved up to cover food drinks and anything else I want to buy in the parks and on property.

Gas programs for free gas

I've written a couple of times about the self-admitted obsession I have with either not paying for gas or at the very least not paying anywhere close to full price for gas.

Whenever I have an RV trip coming up I begin to strategize about a month out how to earn enough credits in a variety of programs to cover the diesel I'll need to buy for the nine-hour drive to and from Orlando from my home in the Atlanta area.

Fuel Rewards GetUpside TruNow Pay with Gas Buddy Marathon's Make-it-Count Kroger Fuel Points and some targeted Amex offers can all make it incredibly cheap or free (depending on what promotions are occurring) for my summer drive to Orlando.

Bottom line

Through a combination of using Venture Miles earned from a sign-up bonus free Disney gift cards thanks to a new Amex Platinum monthly perk and a variety of programs that let you save on gas I should have my summer jaunt to Disney World be entirely free when it comes to cash required from my wallet.

There may likely be some unexpected cost of an RV part repair or something else unforeseen but as it stands I'm pleased with the different redemptions and strategy I have planned to cover my travel lodging tickets and food. Disney is always fun but it's that much more fun when the cost to me is $0.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vcnVzc2lhbm1hY2hpbmVuZXZlcmJyZWFrcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8xMC9sb2NhbC1kdW5raW4tZG9udXRzLWNlbGVicmF0aW5nLXRqLW9zaGllcy0yNTB0aC1jYXJlZXItZ29hbC13aXRoLWZyZWUtZG9udXRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Local Dunkin' Donuts celebrating TJ Oshie's 250th career goal with free donuts,"This article is over 3 years old

Dunkin’ Donuts is celebrating a TJ Oshie milestone goal with free donuts.

The celebration comes after Oshie scored his 250th goal against the Boston Bruins on April 8. Oshie deflected the puck home on a 5-on-3 power play.

Oshie has lent his voice to animated Dunkin’ commercials this season teaming up with Bruins’ superstar David Pastrnak.

Oshie is a notorious donut fan. Last season Oshie’s daughter Leni promised dad a donut if he scored in a game on February 10. Oshie scored his 21st goal of the season that night and the family got donuts the very next day.

WASHINGTON — The Kennedy Center announced this week that a fall reopening will take place in September as part of a special 50th-anniversary celebration at the venue.

Kennedy Center President Deborah Rutter spoke to WUSA9 during an exclusive interview Friday and gave us a tour of the site.

The historic halls and theaters continued to sit quiet and empty much like they have for the past year.

Aside from a small number of limited capacity performances late last year the crowds are missing. Rutter can still remember the last night of performances in March of 2020 when she knew the Kennedy Center would be closing for at least a few weeks.

""On Wednesday morning March 11 I said 'Gang are we all okay? I’m planning on leaving tomorrow for a few days with my daughter'"" Rutter recalled. ""By four o’clock that afternoon we were going to the meeting with the mayor and she was telling us that we needed to start closing down. We went to the last performance that evening and immediately closed down after.”

Rutter believed the shutdown would at first last around six weeks. It turned to months.

Over 1500 performances have been canceled due to the pandemic since then while thousands of jobs at the venue have been lost.

In total the Kennedy Center estimates there has been a loss of $250 million in revenue and donations.

Cuts even spread to the National Symphony Orchestra where each musician was forced to take a 28% reduction in pay.

After months of hardship however Rutter wanted to start planning for the show to go on for the venue's 50th anniversary.

""We have really gone into a high level of detail to make sure that everybody is really safe"" Rutter said. ""It takes time and levels of expertise. The good news is we’ve had a year to figure this out.”

Some of the precautions will be the things many have grown accustomed to during the pandemic; from mask-wearing and temperature checks to reminders to stay socially distant. However some of the changes have even spread to the performers and musicians.

Inside the concert hall plexiglass dividers remained up on the stage for the National Symphony Orchestra sessions. Anyone who plays a wind instrument is separated by the glass while all the members have increased space between them.

Due to the social distancing the venue built the stage out further over the first few rows of seats.

For now the Kennedy Center will follow D.C. guidelines going into effect in May restricting attendance inside entertainment venues to 25% capacity.

""Everybody is going to have multiple seats between them and multiple rows between them as well"" said Rutter while looking over the empty theater on Friday.

Organizers are hoping for a full reopening by the time September rolls around. Beginning this spring and summer the Kennedy Center plans to hold a limited number of indoor performances with smaller and socially distant crowds. More details on the events are expected later this month. By September the ""celebratory reactivation"" will be in full swing.

On Sept. 10 the National Symphonic Orchestra will hold a remembrance concert to mark the 20th anniversary of 9/11 and honor the lives lost during the pandemic.

The anniversary season will also include many other shows concerts programs and special events including the unveiling of a statue of President John F. Kennedy on the REACH campus in November. More information for the season can be found here.

Moving forward Rutter said the reopening of the Kennedy Center marked an important milestone for arts in D.C. and a special opportunity for others to come together.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vY2F1c2V3YXljcm93ZC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8xMC9ib3N0b24tYnJ1aW5zLWplcmVteS1zd2F5bWFuLW1ha2luZy1tb3N0LW9mLW9wcG9ydHVuaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boston Bruins: Jeremy Swayman is making the most of his opportunity,Next.

(Published 2021),"SAN CLEMENTE Calif. — Word got around when Kristine Hostetter was spotted at a public mask-burning at the San Clemente pier and when she appeared in a video sitting onstage as her husband spoke at a QAnon convention. People talked when she angrily accosted a family wearing masks near a local surfing spot her granddaughter in tow.

Even in San Clemente a well-heeled redoubt of Southern California conservatism Ms. Hostetter stood out for her vehement embrace of both the rebellion against Covid-19 restrictions and the stolen-election lies pushed by former President Donald J. Trump. This was after all a teacher so beloved that each summer parents jockeyed to get their children into her fourth-grade class.

But it was not until Ms. Hostetter’s husband posted a video of her marching down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol on Jan. 6 that her politics collided with an opposite force gaining momentum in San Clemente: a growing number of left-leaning parents and students who in the wake of the civil-rights protests set off by the police killing of George Floyd decided they would no longer countenance the right-wing tilt of their neighbors and the racism they said was commonplace.

That there was no evidence that Ms. Hostetter had displayed any overt racism was beside the point — to them her pro-Trump views seemed self-evidently laced with white supremacy. So she became their cause."

In a column for the archdiocesan newspaper on Wednesday Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York implored Catholics to return to Sunday Mass during the Easter Season.

Apr 10 2021

By Matt Hadro

In a column for the archdiocesan newspaper on Wednesday Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York implored Catholics to return to Sunday Mass during the Easter Season.



“Yes for the last year we have prudently been able to decide that the emergency health crisis can allow us to excuse ourselves from that God-given obligation” Cardinal Dolan wrote in a column for Catholic New York. Those vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic such as the elderly “can still excuse themselves as has always been the case” he wrote.

However many other Catholics are already returning to public activities without attending Mass and they should return to church he said.

“But for the majority of us—are we going to restaurants? To the kids’ soccer and little league games? To the store? To the beauty parlor? To gatherings with family and friends?” Cardinal Dolan asked. “Well then it’s time to get back to Mass.”

In March 2020 all Catholic dioceses in the U.S. suspended public Masses due to the spread of COVID-19. While all dioceses have reopened churches since then only a few have reinstated a modified Sunday obligation where Catholics who are not symptomatic and who are not at high risk from COVID-19 or caring for the sick must return to Sunday Mass.

The Archdiocese of New York suspended public Masses last spring but churches began to reopen during the summer. Cardinal Dolan referenced last year’s closures in his column.



“We had no choice since wise health guidelines required us to close our church buildings” he wrote. Once the archdiocese reopened parishes for Mass the parishes “rose to the occasion with scrupulous cleaning sanitation ventilation distancing and restrictions” he wrote noting that parishioners “gradually began to return.”

“No more gradual about it! It’s time to get back to Sunday Mass!” Cardinal Dolan wrote on Wednesday.

The recent Paschal Triduum emphasized the importance of the Mass which itself is the renewal of the Triduum he said.

“We recognize Jesus at Mass and Holy Communion. We enter again the eternal infinite mystery of His death on the cross and resurrection from the dead. Every Sunday Mass is a renewal of the Last Supper Good Friday and Easter” Cardinal Dolan wrote.

A spokesman for the archdiocese clarified that the Sunday obligation where Catholics are required by canon law to attend Mass on Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation except in grave cases where they cannot was never suspended in the archdiocese.

While public Masses were suspended by the archdiocese for several months due to the spread of COVID-19 the Sunday obligation was in place once churches reopened for Mass the spokesman noted. However the usual “grave” reasons for Catholics not to attend Sunday Mass – such as sickness or being in danger of the COVID-19 pandemic – still applied and Catholics were free to decline to attend Mass for ""a serious reason.""––CNA",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9lZG1vbnRvbi9yYWxseS1ncmFjZWxpZmUtY2xvc2VkLTEuNTk4MzQzNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hundreds rally outside Alberta church closed by health officials,"Hundreds of people demonstrated Sunday outside the shuttered GraceLife Church west of Edmonton.

Alberta Health Services closed the church last week after it repeatedly defied public health orders with hundreds of people attending services. Chain link fences were set up around the site in Parkland County.

The crowd began gathering along the road adjacent to the church early Sunday morning as hymns played over loudspeakers. Demonstrators carried signs with a variety of messages some decrying vaccines public health restrictions and communism.

An increased police presence by the RCMP included additional traffic enforcement officers deployed to the area.

Police said in a statement they would only use the level of intervention necessary to ensure safety and maintain peace order and security.

Dozens of police vehicles shut off access to roads around the church while a helicopter flew overhead. A large line of at least 30 officers faced the outer fence.

There was a tense moment around noon when a group splintered from the crowd and tore down part of the fence. RCMP and others from the crowd pushed back the group and re-established the fence.

About 150 of the protesters trespassed on Enoch Cree Nation land across the road from the church site parking their cars and vandalising Enoch Chief Billy Morin's vehicle said Enoch spokesperson Tanya Cardinal.

One trespasser attempted to assault an Enoch councillor the First Nation added in a statement released Sunday.

""Although I respect GraceLife protesters' right to protest right to worship and right to free speech I strongly condemn their illegal trespassing on our land their vandalization of a Nation member's vehicle and their blatant disrespect of our sovereignty as a proud First Nation"" Morin said.

RCMP Const. Kathleen Fossen said one man was arrested for obstruction and later released with conditions.

The crowd began to disperse shortly before 2 p.m. The trespassers had mostly vacated Enoch land by 4 p.m. the First Nation said.

In a statement released Sunday evening through the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms GraceLife church stated that its congregants were not at the protest.

In a media statement Wednesday AHS said it had ""physically closed"" the church and would prevent access until the church ""can demonstrate the ability to comply with Alberta's chief medical officer of health's restrictions.""

""With COVID-19 cases increasing and the more easily-transmitted and potentially more severe variants becoming dominant there is urgent need to minimize spread to protect all Albertans"" AHS said.

On Sunday the province reported 1183 new cases of COVID-19 and 942 new cases involving variants of concern. There were 7217 active variant cases about 50.5 per cent of active cases in Alberta.

Between July 10 last year and Tuesday of last week AHS said it has received 105 complaints from the public about the church.

AHS said inspectors have conducted 18 inspections at the site since July 10 2020 and violations were observed at each visit.

GraceLife's Pastor James Coates was charged in February with violating COVID-19 public health orders.

After he was charged Coates was jailed for refusing to comply with a bail condition that he only hold services in compliance with public health orders. In early March his lawyers appealed with the argument that it would go against the pastor's conscience before God not to lead worshippers.

Coates spent 35 days in custody before pleading guilty to a charge of breaching bail and was fined $1500. He returned to the pulpit on March 28.

The church was also charged as an entity for exceeding allowable capacity at Sunday services in February.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNpdGl6ZW4uY28udHovdGFuemFuaWEvbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC9jYXJkaW5hbC1wZW5nby0yNy15ZWFycy1vZi11bnBhcmFsbGVsZWQtc3VjY2Vzcy0yNjg5NjU40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cardinal Pengo: 27 years of unparalleled success | The Citizen,"For most of the faithful he is more than a cardinal or a bishop. In the world of spirits devout Catholics in Dar es Salaam and elsewhere he served consider him a loving father who has lived to feed and safeguard his family with the word of God.

His humbleness hardworking even in times of sickness and great pain has left a mark not only in the souls of faithful but even the subordinates he is leading.

When it became apparent that his health was sharply deteriorating many thought it was the end of it. But he hanged for over four years in a style and spiritual strength some say is a miracle. This is Cardinal Polycarp Pengo the archbishop of the archdiocese of Dar es Salaam since 1992 following the resignation of Cardinal Laurean Rugambwa.

The spiritual and social progress he initiated in the largest and complex metropolitan of Dar es Salaam diocese are so great touched and changed lives of thousands in and outside the church.

When he took possession the Dar es Salaam archdiocese had just over 20 parishes. He is now credited for establishing over 90 new parishes in the past 25 years.

The cardinal defied the odds to take the church to Muslim-dominated areas like Mafia island and Kibiti in Rufiji District. In the eyes of unbelievers the move was a huge loss but the social services that came with the parishes like schools and health centres have made him more relevant today than the days he initiated the works.

“Indeed these are very big successes. Many schools have been built during his time. Youths acquired skills for self-employment to serve the church and the nation at large. He took the gospel to areas no one thought of before” says a faithful at St. Joseph Cathedral.

He is also credited for promoting harmonious relationship between Catholics and other denominations and religions. During the middle of his carrier the cardinal distinguished himself as bold and no nonsense. In those days he spared no individual or institution issuing statements threatening the unity of the country and the mission of the church.

Believer of Nyerere philosophy

He was a staunch believer of founding father of the nation Mwalimu Julius Kambarage Nyerere.

During his studies he chose to research on Nyerere’s philosophy of building a united nation and used it to emphasise the role of the church in promoting patriotism. He is also a believer of self-reliance for the church and individuals.

“We as the conference (The Tanzania Episcopal Conference) say he has recognised and cherished the contribution of his predecessors and founders of the nation in building the sense of patriotism” says Dr Charles Kitima general secretary of Tanzania Episcopal Conference.

Dr Kitima says TEC views the cardinal as among people who have exceptionally strengthened the spirit of self-governing and self-reliance of the church in Tanzania.

“At the national level we see a person who loved patriotism. He believed the church has a role in promoting patriotism among people” says Dr Kitima.

There were only 20 priests when he was appointed Bishop of Dare s Salaam but he ‘brewed’ 73 new priests during his tenure. Insiders praise him for promoting priests and appointing most committed ones to serve the church.

In February 1998 Pope John Paul II elevated him to cardinalship. This position is given to those who have exceptionally demonstrated readiness to die for the truth and the gospel they preach. His duties include participating in Papal conclaves (Papal elections) when the Holy See is vacant.

He has participated in the conclave of April 2005 which elected Pope Benedict XVI and in the conclave of March 2013 which elected Pope Francis.

Social political arena

It is no secret during the first two decades of his carreer in Dar es Salaam the cardinal was known for his boldness and speaking his mind .

He waste no time to openly hit out at the government and institutions when he felt their words and actions posed a moral and political threat to the church and the nation.

That won him unimaginable prominence.

In August 2009 the cardinal publicly rejected the government’s advice that the church should first consult the government before giving out pastoral letters to the Christian communities or those in authorities. The church had just issued an apostolic letter that expounded on civic education and citizen’s participation in debates and electoral process to get quality leaders. That was few weeks before the 2010 General Elections were held. CCM’s National Executive Committee (NEC) was irked by the letter. They met and came out with a strong statement advising the religious leaders to first consult with the government before issuing such documents.

Speaking at the burial of bishop Antony Mayalla days later the cardinal rejected the adivice saying the church would never take the advice from the government whenever it wanted to communicate with the faithful.

He vowed the church will continue issuing the apostolic documents without involving the government saying allowing that was failure to do God’s work.

There are many more instances that the top cleric did not hesitate to come out boldly in defence of the church and the nation unity.

However observers say towards the end of his carreer there were seeing the cardinal different from what he was in the past.

What observers regard as unusual softness of the cardinal was evident when TEC’s committee on peace and justice issued a circular in 2014 asking the Constituent Assembly not to ignore proposals of the Constitutional Review Commission on the structure of the union between Tanganyika and Zanzibar.

Two days after the cardinal came out to condemn the document saying it did not represent the position of the Church in Tanzania.

“The views of the committee cannot be the position of the church. The church has its procedures of issuing its positions which are issued by the president of TEC” he then said. The move drew criticism from rights activists and critics of the government who thought the cardinal was leaning towards the government. In March last year the cardinal was at it again when he disassociated himself from an apostolic letter authored by TEC to prepare the faithful for the start of lent.

The letter warned of deteriorating democratic situation and suppression of civic and political rights.

Again the cardinal came out to tell the media that he was not part of the letter which he said has mixed religion and politics. “I cannot see how I can be the author and preacher of that letter that was prepared by bishops. I don’t want to say that letter is bad but the whole letter is a mix-up of religion and politics. That is not the work of the bishops it is the work of politicians” he said.

His position on the document was met with mixed reaction.“When I look at his two decades of service in Dar and his last five years it’s as if we had two different Pengos” said a devout catholic who asked not to be named. Whether the cardinal has softened stance or not remains the question of further discussion and arguments.

Responding to the views Dr Kitima says it would be unfair to judge the cardinal without considering the times and circumstances when he was making the statements.

“Personally I say sometimes people judge a person without looking at circumstances and the position he has. We need to ask what challenges and problems that existed in that time which don’t exist today. He never remains quiet on issues that threaten the unity and peace.

“I see the values which he stood for that time are what he is defending today but the circumstances age and times are contributing to people’s judgment’ he says.

Deteriorating health

The faithful started to notice the deteriorating health of the cardinal about four years ago. However the physical weakness seemed to have fueled his spiritual strengthen. He continued to offer church services even at time his weakening health became a threat.

He led masses and offered Sacraments while seated. He defied doctors in India the US and Germany who advised him to take a rest and continued with the church mission.",,,,,,

David Bernstein chief financial officer said that while the company has secured liquidity to sustain it well into 2022 with zero revenue once it resumes cruising cash flow will be the primary driver to return to investment grade credit over time creating shareholder value.

Carnival is targeting an ROIC (return on invested capital) in the double-digits he said.

Meanwhile the company will receive significant cost efficiencies from the exit of older ships while introducing new ships across the different brands and is also continuing efforts to gain more efficiencies across the fleet to reduce costs further and to right-size its shoreside operations.

In addition Carnival is working to refinance early expensive debt and lower interest costs while returning to guest operations as quickly as possible and still serving the interest of public health. However it will be patient in terms of reducing its debt load and using extra cash until it has a clear picture of the fleet being back in service.

At the end of its fiscal Q  February 28 2021 Carnival had $11.5 billion in cash and short-term investments and projects a monthly cash burn of approximately $550 million for the first half of 2021 including additional start up expenditures.

Arnold Donald president and CEO said he anticipates a staggered resumption of service and starting with less than 50 percent occupancy which could ramp up quickly as long as the proper execution is in place and going well.

Donald also noted that the break-even point is from 30 to 50 percent occupancy. Bernstein added that the top 25 ships in the fleet could generate enough cash to cover the pause of the other 60 ships if sailing at full capacity including the full $2.5 billion of SG&A the company had in 2019.

Ships from both Carnival Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean International sailed to the Caribbean island of Saint Vincent to help evacuate people from the volcano's imminent eruption named La Soufrière.

The Caribbean island went into red alert on Thursday with Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves ordering an evacuation of all northern districts of the island which has a population of approximately 100000.

The northern areas are home to around 16000 people. All have been ordered to leave immediately as they were in the direct path of lava flow and literal fire from the volcano.

However commercial cruise ships came to the rescue. Carnival Cruise Line sent two ships — Carnival Legend and Carnival Paradise — to the island on Friday. Royal Caribbean International also sent two ships — Serenade of the Seas and Celebrity Reflection. They arrived on Friday evening with a third expected to arrive in the coming days.

Each ship is expected to take on board up to 1500 people. They will be transported to neighboring islands who have agreed to house them according to Travel Weekly.

On Thursday as reported by the Saint Vincent online newspaper News 784 Geologist Richard Robertson said that La Soufrière could erupt at any given time in a matter of days or even hours as the volcano has been increasingly active since November.

Monitoring stations also reported long earthquakes which suggested that magma was attempting to reach the surface meaning the volcano was ready to transition to an explosive stage.

On Friday Saint Vincent's National Emergency Management Organisation (NEMO) tweeted that the volcano had indeed ""moved into an explosive stage"" and erupted.

""Vincentians are waking up to extremely heavy ashfall and strong sulfur smells which have now advanced to the capital"" NEMO tweeted. There have been no reported casualties as of yet.

La Soufrière last erupted in April 1979. There were no casualties and the local population was successfully evacuated.

The volcano's deadliest eruption was in 1902 when 1600 people (predominantly indigenous Caribs) were killed. Shortly after that eruption Martinique's Mount Pelee also erupted and destroyed the town of Saint-Pierre. More than 30000 people died as a result.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL3dlZWtseS1jcnVpc2UtbmV3cy1hcHJpbC0xMC0yMDIxLzQ5NTAx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weekly Cruise News: April 10 2021,"Here we go with another full week of cruise news updates covering all the major cruise lines and even that massive news coming from Florida.

There have been several new developments from the week as the State of Florida fights for cruises to reopen and the cruise industry continues its calls for the CDC to lift the Conditional Sailing Order.

In addition to all that drama there have been so many cruise news updates with extended suspensions from Carnival Cruise line Royal Caribbean Virgin Voyages and Disney Cruise Line along with a continued shift to homeports outside the U.S.

Florida Sues the Federal Government and CDC

With the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) still not lifting the Conditional Sailing Order The State of Florida and Gov. Ron DeSantis have moved forward and filed a lawsuit against the Federal Government and the CDC to allow cruises immediately.

The announcement was made at PortMiami and the Governor specifically talked about the impact the shutdown is having in Florida. He said it didn’t make sense not to allow cruises to restart especially as people will be traveling to alternative homeports outside the U.S. such as the Bahamas anyway.

DeSantis believes the Federal Government does not have the right to mothball a major industry for over a year. He thinks there is a good chance for success. The possibility of this happening has been in discussion for many weeks and DeSantis is partnering with Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody to make it happen.

Royal Caribbean Extends Suspension in the U.S.

And we now head into all the suspensions starting with Royal Caribbean. The company has extended its hold on U.S. operations through June 30 2021 and this impacts Royal Caribbean International Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises.

Cruises are not set to resume until July at the very earliest. However the further suspension does not impact operations out of other countries including the newly announced homeports that Royal Caribbean plans on sailing from this summer.

Carnival Cruise Line Extends Suspension

Carnival Cruise Line has also extended its suspension in the U.S. It comes as the Conditional Sailing Order by the CDC remains in place despite many calls for it to be lifted. So the further suspension is now through June 30 2021 and it does also impact Mardi Gras’ debut which was scheduled for June 5 but now she is delayed for a sixth time until July 3 2021.

For now Carnival remains “America’s cruise line” but patience is running out with the CDC. Carnival Cruise Line President Christine Duffy has said that they may be forced to start shifting ships to alternative ports outside the United States.

Keep checking with all the latest and we’ll make sure you’re first to know on what the cruise line decides what to do.

Virgin Voyages to Sail UK Domestic Cruises

It has been a busy week of news for Virgin Voyages as the cruise line announced cancellations into September 2021 and then not long after announced new UK domestic sailings for the summer.

Prepared for worst

After holding exercises in waters east of the island of Taiwan for about a week the Liaoning aircraft carrier task group of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy reportedly sailed south on Saturday into the South China Sea where a US carrier strike group and an amphibious ready group held provocative exercises one day earlier as tensions between China and the US continue to rise over the island of Taiwan with the US loosening restrictions on government engagement with the island.The Liaoning aircraft carrier task group was observed entering the South China Sea on Saturday after conducting exercises around the island of Taiwan US media outlet The Drive reported on Sunday citing foreign commercial satellite images.On April 3 the PLA Navy carrier task group passed through waters between Okinawa Island and Miyako Island Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff said in a press release on April 4 indicating that the group was likely training in waters east of the island of Taiwan . On April 5 a PLA Navy spokesperson confirmed the carrier Liaoning was conducting exercises near the island of Taiwan as part of annually scheduled regular training.The Liaoning was not the only aircraft carrier recently active in the South China Sea as the US' Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group and the Makin Island amphibious ready group conducted a coordinated exercise in the region on Friday The Drive report said citing a statement by the US Indo-Pacific Command on Friday.Beijing-based think tank the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative openly tracked the entries of the two US warship groups into the region on April 4 and Thursday respectively prior to US announcements.Overseas media said it was rare to see US and Chinese carrier groups mass in the South China Sea and the PLA move is seen as a response to the US exercises. The Drive said the Dongsha Islands currently occupied by Taiwan is a focal point.The Liaoning carrier task group's exercises are regular and scheduled annually so it is a coincidence that the two countries' carriers conducted drills in the same region Song Zhongping a Chinese military affairs expert and TV commentator told the Global Times on Sunday.Similar instances will just take place increasingly more often with China's future aircraft carrier development program another Chinese military analyst told the Global Times on Sunday requesting anonymity.China's second aircraft carrier the Shandong which entered service in late 2019 is home-ported on the doorstep of the South China Sea in Sanya South China's Hainan Province. As it gradually gains operational capability China will have a carrier sailing in the South China Sea very often in addition to occasional exercises conducted by the Liaoning which is home-ported further away the above-quoted analyst said.Deeming the US exercises as provocations Beijing-based military expert Wei Dongxu said that the PLA carrier exercises can establish wider maritime defensive positions safeguard China's coastal regions and keep US military activities in check.Song said that the US' moves were aimed at exercising its ""freedom of navigation"" deterring the PLA and maintaining US' global hegemony with the South China Sea and over the island of Taiwan.At the same time as managing risks of military conflict with the US the PLA should continue to enhance its combat preparedness make constant efforts to develop its capabilities and become a force to deter US forces that attempt to contain China Song said.The US Department of State announced on Saturday (Beijing time) that it had issued new guidelines for US government interactions with counterparts on the island of Taiwan to encourage US government engagement with the island that reflects their ""deepening unofficial relationship.""The Biden administration will continue playing the ""Taiwan card"" to pressure China and the new guidelines are a move that Washington had made to test how the Chinese mainland will react but there will not be a qualitative change to the relations between the US and the island of Taiwan observers said.Shi Hong executive chief editor of the Chinese mainland magazine Shipborne Weapons told the Global Times last week that PLA aircraft carriers operating on the east side of Taiwan island can isolate the island's forces from foreign intervention from that direction but the recent US aircraft carrier exercise in the South China Sea indicated that US forces could also reinforce Taiwan secessionists from the south if the situation arises analysts said.If a military conflict breaks out in the Taiwan Straits the US will likely rally its allies and confront China also in the Bohai Sea Yellow Sea East China Sea and South China Sea which is a worst-case scenario for the PLA Song saidBut the PLA is prepared as shown in many of its exercises that took place in all major Chinese sea areas simultaneously featuring joint operations of multiple military branches Song said.Recently naval forces of PLA Southern Eastern and Northern Theater Commands all held combat-oriented exercises the overseas edition of the People's Daily reported on Sunday. Similar drills have been frequently conducted over the past year.While the Chinese and US aircraft carriers coincidentally being in the same region attracted media attention it is not necessary for the PLA to counter an aircraft carrier with an aircraft carrier as the PLA also operates ""aircraft carrier killer"" anti-ship ballistic missiles like the DF-21D and DF-26 analysts said.On Friday the day the US carrier conducted exercises in the South China Sea the PLA South Sea Fleet released a statement outlining a series of recent exercises it had organized including anti-submarine drills with patrol aircraft anti-ship live-fire shooting with warships and amphibious landing exercises.On China's doorstep no matter whether it is around the island of Taiwan or in the South China Sea the PLA has many methods for battle holds many advantages over foreign forces that travel from afar to arrive and is determined and capable of safeguarding China's national sovereignty security and development interests analysts said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9idXp6L3J1c3NpYW4tbmF2eSVFMiU4MCU5OXMtbnVjbGVhci1wb3dlcmVkLWJhdHRsZWNydWlzZXItbm93LXJpcC0xODI0MzTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Russian Navy's Nuclear-Powered Battlecruiser: Now RIP?,"Initially projected to rejoin the Navy in 2018 the Nakhimov’s handoff was subsequently postponed to 2022. Now its been pushed back even more.

The post-refit handover of Russia’s Admiral Nakhimov battlecruiser has reportedly been postponed.

A defense industry source told Russian news outlet TASS earlier this week that the delivery of Admiral Nakhimov has been pushed back “due to problems with suppliers.” The source did not give a concrete timeline but told TASS that the handover is “postponed until 2023 at best.”

One of the largest and heaviest surface combatant ships in the world the Kirov-class nuclear-powered battlecruiser Admiral Nakhimov was commissioned in 1988 under a different name: Kalinin. The Kirov class has its roots in a prominent strain of Soviet 1970’s military thinking. Initially conceived as a battlecruiser— that is a lighter and faster variant of battleship— to counter the U.S. navy’s latest submarines with its large payload of SS-N-14 anti-submarine missiles the Kirov line grew into another no less important role: namely containing the threat from U.S. carrier strike groups (CSG’s). Armed with twenty onboard P-700 Granit anti-ship missiles Kirov-class vessels were meant to threaten U.S. aircraft carriers and other large surface ships. There was yet another broader strategic goal: Kirov-class battlecruisers were intended to operate alongside a class of dedicated modern aircraft carriers heralding a new era of Soviet global power projection.

The grand strategic visions driving the Kirov-class project collapsed alongside the Soviet Union. The ill-fated Admiral Kuznetsov became the only carrier of its line and is now undergoing major repairs following a series of catastrophic incidents including an onboard fire and collapsed drydock. Meanwhile the four Kirov-class cruisers—Admiral Ushakov Admiral Lazarev Kalinin and Petr Velikiy— fell into disrepair over the 1990s. Two of these Petr Velikiy and Kalinin were deemed to be in a salvageable state. Kalinin was renamed to Admiral Nakhimov in 1992 and has been docked since 1999. Modernization work on Nakhimov began in earnest only in 2013. As part of its deep refit Admiral Nakhimov will be upgraded to carry 3M22 Tsirkon winged anti-ship hypersonic cruise missiles Kalibr cruise missiles and Otvet anti-submarine missiles as well as the Fort-M (a naval S-300 variant) and Pantsir-M air defense systems. The Russian navy is likewise reportedly planning to outfit Admiral Nakhimov as well as its counterpart Petr Velikiy with a naval version of the S-400 missile system. These prodigious armament updates will be accompanied by a modernized radar and onboard electronics suite. If successful this refit will place Admiral Nakhimov high among the ranks of Russia’s most capable large surface warships.

Initially projected to rejoin the Navy in 2018 the Nakhimov’s handoff was subsequently postponed to 2022. Sevmash CEO Mikhail Budnichenko repeated the 2022 projection at Russia’s ARMY 2020 military exhibition. That date was also reaffirmed by Russia’s United Shipbuilding Corporation (UAC) head Alexei Rakhmanov. “We are planning to complete the ship’s repairs in 2022” said Rakhmanov during Shipbuilders’ Day celebrations in 2020. Russian officials have not formally confirmed this latest alleged delay to 2023 or later nor has its cause been identified as of the time of writing.

On 20 October 2019 the development plan and future launch plan of China's latest rocket series the ""Dragon"" series of carrier rockets were released in Beijing. The ""Dragon"" series is the first carrier rocket series launched by the Aerospace Science and Technology Group after the ""Long March"" series for commercial aerospace launches mainly to meet the growing demand for commercial loads to orbit at home and abroad. The ""Dragon"" series of products are planned to be divided into two categories ""Jielong"" solid commercial launch vehicle series and ""Tenglong"" liquid commercial launch vehicle series.

The ""Jielong"" series includes Jielong 1 2 and 3 solid launch vehicles and Jielong-S suborbital vehicles. This series of rockets can launch a spacecraft of 200 kg to 1.5 tons to a sun-synchronous orbit 500 kilometers from the ground. The first flight of Jielong No. 1 was successfully completed on August 17 2019. Jielong No. 2 and No. 3 planned to complete their first flight tests in 2020 and 2021 respectively.

The precise relationship among the four rockets was unclear and was not clarified by some of the the charts and the models initially released. The models suggest that the Jielong 1 Jielong 2 and Jielong 3 might have diameters of 1 2 and 3 meters. But the chart suggests that the Jielong 2 and Jielong 3 are about the same size which seems not quite right. The models depict that Jielong-S sounding rocket as rather smaller than even the Jielong 1 launcher while the chart depicts the Jielong-S and Jielong 1 as about the same size which it not plausible.

More detailed individual artwork of the four individual vehicles clarified the relationships. ChinaRocket a commercial space wing of the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology the country's leading rocket-maker on 21 October 2019 unveiled its plans to develop a number of carrier rocket models to tap the space launch market. The company announced that its researchers were designing two types of solid-propellant carrier rockets  Smart Dragon 2 and Smart Dragon 3  and at least one liquid-propellant type the Flying Dragon 1. The SD series is designed to provide reliable convenient and economic launch services for commercial satellite enterprises to build their networks or test their equipment. Tang Yagang president of ChinaRocket said at a news conference in Beijing that the company will strive for annual production of up to 10 SD-2s and eight SD-3s to meet demand from the burgeoning commercial space industry.

The SD-2 will be 21 meters tall with a diameter of 2 meters and will have a liftoff weight of 60 metric tons. It will be capable of carrying a 500-kilogram payload to a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 500 kilometers. Flight tests are to begin next year. The SD-3 with a total length of 31 meters a diameter of 2.6 meters and a liftoff weight of about 116 tons will be capable of sending more than 1.5 tons to the same orbit. Its maiden flight is penciled in for 2021.

The SD-1 the first in the series and the youngest member of China's carrier rocket family made its debut flight in August from northwestern China's Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center successfully placing three satellites into an orbit about 550 kilometers above Earth. The mission gave China its fourth brand of carrier rocket alongside China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp's Long March series China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp's Kuaizhou and the SQX made by the privately owned space startup iSpace in Beijing. The SD-1 is 19.5 meters tall has a diameter of 1.2 meters and weighs 23.1 tons. The rocket can place multiple satellites with a combined weight of 200 kg into a sun-synchronous orbit 500 km above the ground. It is China's smallest and lightest carrier rocket.

The FD-1 will be a medium-lift liquid-fuel rocket that is reusable. It is currently in the detailed planning phase. Designers expect the rocket to ferry medium-size and large satellites or several small satellites. The first flight is planned for 2021 Tang said.

The ""Jielong"" series of solid carrier rockets pursue the goal of ""high cost-effectiveness high reliability fast compliance and fast launch"" and provide reliable convenient and economical exclusive launches for domestic and foreign commercial satellite users for constellation networking supplementary network and payload verification. It would provide scheduled orbit launch and loading services.

The ""Dragon"" series of launch vehicles are medium and small tonnage launch vehicles mainly to meet the growing market demand for rocket launches at home and abroad. The biggest feature of the ""Dragon"" series is its rapid launch capability. Compared with the ""Long March"" series of carrier rockets the ""Dragon"" series is much smaller. The ""Dragon"" series consists of the ""Jielong"" solid carrier rocket series and the ""Tenglong"" liquid carrier rocket. The series consists of the ""Jielong"" series currently has four models all of which are solid fuel rockets namely the ""Jielong"" No. 1 2 and 3 and the ""Jielong""-S suborbital carrier. With a load capacity of 200 kg to 1.5 tons it can achieve a sun-synchronous orbit with a height of 500 kilometers. The main feature is the rapid launch capability the use of high reliability and high cost performance to achieve rapid launch deployment which can be launched not only from land but also from sea.

Kuaizhou 1 was reportedly a satellite for natural disaster monitoring. It will be used to monitor natural disasters and provide disaster-relief information for its user the National Remote Sensing Center of China a public institution under the Ministry of Science and Technology. The Kuaizhou-1 satellite was launched from Jiuquan by China's new Kuaizhou small quick-response launch vehicle on 25 September 2013.

The Chinese military plans the new solid-fueled Kuaizhou [quick-vessel might best be translated as ""Clipper"" or ""Swift Boat""] launch vehicle to provide a rapid ability to replace Chinese satellites that might be damaged or destroyed by an American attack. The vehicle can reportedly place 400 kg into orbit.

In the domestic public publication ""Journal of the Academy of Equipment Command and Technology"" in the fifth issue of 2011 the outside world can roughly understand the development of China's ""emergency space vehicle"". The ""Emergency Space Vehicle"" was a new concept aircraft with fast integration fast entry into orbit and the integration of stars and arrows. Conventional space vehicles usually develop one produce one and launch one. The characteristics of an ""emergency space vehicle"" determine that it was the same as missile weapons mass production long-term storage and one-time use.

In layman's terms the concept of the ""Quick Boat"" is: when emergency tactical reconnaissance and communication services are required for specific targets the launch platform on standby in a hidden area accepts launch orders and the mobile launch platform carrying the star and arrow combination was used in tactical Moving to the scheduled launch position under cover the star and arrow combination launches into the air and quickly enters the scheduled orbit. From receiving the order to putting it into use the entire launch process only takes a few hours or days while a regular launch takes at least 6 to 9 months.

The ""Kaizhou-1"" was jointly developed by Harbin Institute of Technology and China Sanjiang Aerospace Corporation (formerly the China Aerospace Ninth Institute in charge of electronic technology) in Xiaogan City Hubei. Relevant information shows that in May 2010 Harbin Institute of Technology and the Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation jointly established 5 industrial technology joint laboratories including ""Quick Response Aircraft"". In February 2011 in the exchange materials of the Heilongjiang Provincial Science and Technology Work Conference Harbin Institute of Technology mentioned for the first time that it had undertaken a number of major national scientific research tasks such as the ""Quick Boat"" during the ""Eleventh Five-Year Plan"" period.

The Kuaizhou-1A carrier rocket (formerly Feitian-1 ) was developed by China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation on the basis of the original Kuaizhou-1 satellite and rocket integrated carrier. The general-purpose solid launch vehicle expands the length and diameter of the fairing improves mission adaptability and increases the space for carrying satellites while ensuring the carrying capacity. Kuaizhou-1A uses a mobile launch platform for launch. The overall design of the Kuaizhou-1A carrier rocket passed the review of the Fourth Academy of Aerospace Science and Industry on July 29 2016.

China Sanjiang Space Group (CSSG) which is located in central China's Hubei province began the development of Kuaizhou-1 and Kuaizhou-2 in 2013 and 2014 respectively. To promote the commercial use of Kuaizhou rockets CASIC Rocket Technology Co. Ltd. a commercial rocket development and launch company was registered and established on 16 February 2016 in Wuhan Hubei province according to Wuhan-based CSSG. Kuaizhou-1 and Kuaizhou-2 have been signed to the newly established company. The company planned to develop more than 10 units of rockets mainly targeting low-orbit small satellites in the future. China plans to launch a video satellite of Jilin-1 the country's first domestically-developed remote sensing satellite for commercial use. The satellite was to be launched via Kuaizhou-1 near the end of 2016.

Gregory Kulacki noted that ""According to a February 2013 Chinese press report on the Kuaizhou program this new Chinese military space capability will be operated by the 2nd Artillery the branch of the Chinese military that operates Chinas land-based missile forces including its land-based nuclear missiles. The February report indicates the Kuaizhou program calls for pre-positioning launchers and their attached satellites at various locations around the country. Should Chinese satellites used to provide imaging communication and data relay functions come under attack during a time of war the 2nd Artillery could launch small replacement satellites into orbit within a few hours.... Chinas pursuit of an ORS capability suggests that maintaining Chinese space capabilities in a time of war may be more important to Chinese military strategists than U.S. observers and analysts normally assume.""

Rui C. Barbosa reported September 25 2013 that ""Very little is known about the Kuaizhou rocket other than it was developed by CASIC. No photos or graphics exist in the public domain."" China Defense Mashup reprints without attribuation the Kulacki analysis accompanied by what might be thought to be a photograph of the launcher - in this case a DF-21C. Jonathan McDowell reports that ""The solid fuel vehicle is thought to be built by CASIC in collaboration with the Harbin Institute of Technology and may be a derivative of the DF-21 family like the failed KT-1 launch vehicle of 2002-2003."" Norbert Brügge's amazing website has a photograph of the KZ-1 on the launch pad suggesting a configuration consistent with the DF-21 though not the KT-1.

On November 11 2014 the 10th China Air Show was grandly held in Zhuhai. In the aerospace museum a variety of weapons and equipment appeared causing widespread interest. China's first small solid carrier rocket with innovative features of low cost rapid integration and rapid entry into orbit Feitian One [""Flying Sky""] made its debut. This rocket was mainly used to achieve rapid satellite launch and space deployment during disasters. Foreign media call it To develop Chinas mysterious Kuaizhou satellite.

China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation exhibited the Feitian-1 (FT-1) small launch vehicle. According to the exhibition board of the Science and Industry Group the Feitian 1 carrier rocket will be launched using a mobile launch platform which can provide launch services for small satellites of 300 kg or lighter at home and abroad. According to the model exhibited at this air show the Feitian 1 carrier rocket uses an 18-wheel truck as the chassis of a three-purpose vehicle for transportation erection and launch and it has mobile launch capabilities. The introduction of the Aerospace Science and Industry Group pointed out that the Feitian 1 rocket has the characteristics of simple structure flexible maneuverability and rapid launch. The rocket has a short production cycle low cost reliable operation and high accuracy in orbit. It can be said that it was aimed at the existing large liquid Long March rockets weaknesses.

According to the staff Feitian-1 was a three-stage solid first-stage rocket that can quickly launch small satellites and quickly deploy a network. In the case of a first-stage response the satellite can be launched into the sky in as little as 4 hours. The launch vehicle was fast and convenient to launch and has a low cost. It has been improved on the existing mature technology and has reliable performance. It was also hoped to be promoted abroad for commercial launch at the Zhuhai Air Show which will further reduce the launch cost and better Customer service.

China can quickly replenish the lost satellites through the rapid-response satellite launch system and reverse the decline of the battlefield. Thus China will develop a new generation of rapid response in space. The combat system has important strategic significance.

The Feitian launch vehicle at the 2014 Zhuhai Air Show had similar uses with the Long March 11 rocket but it uses a conventional trailer and had no field maneuverability. This leads to a more demanding launch site selection and the off-road chassis of the Long March 11 rocket can guarantee the vehicle was launched in the field so the launch trajectory can be relatively better.

The grid rudder control technology was used for the first time in China and it was China's first small solid launch vehicle with fast integration and fast orbit capability creating the fastest record of China's space launch.

""Fast"" means fast launch. Not only was the single launch time fast the rockets and satellites can be launched less than a week after entering the field but it can also be launched multiple times in a short period of time and the same batch of launches can be organized. Generally speaking these types of rockets are mostly solid launch vehicles which can be launched in various ways such as underground silos vehicle-mounted maneuvers simple towers etc. and can even be launched from strategic missile nuclear submarines which can get rid of the dependence on large satellite launch bases. It was reported that for the launch of the Kuaizhou-2 satellite the user requires the team to successfully launch it within the specified number of days to prove that Kuaizhou was worthy of its name. There was no precedent for the short time. The chief designer said: ""Rapid launch is included in the assessment. If it is not completed within the specified time even if the final launch is successful it will not be considered as a completion of the task."" ""Much"" means more load capacity and generally one ton of small satellite can be launched into orbit. For nanosatellites smaller than 10 kilograms it was possible to ""multiple satellites with one arrow"" quickly launch various small satellites into orbit and complete many tasks including emergency communications emergency navigation and emergency reconnaissance. ""Good"" means good results. The worlds nuclear powers have a large number of medium- and long-range solid and liquid ballistic missiles many of which have reached or are close to the time of retirement. They are either disassembled or tested randomly. If it can be transformed into a space rapid launch system to launch satellites it can not only test the technical performance but also provide a new commercial launch platform. ""Saving"" means saving money. A regular large-scale launch vehicle requires at least US$50 million per launch. If the low-cost small launch vehicle can be launched with small payloads especially the waste utilization of decommissioned missiles this will not only reduce launch costs but also It can be described as the best of both worlds by saving some countries a large amount of additional cost of destroying missiles. ""Light"" means small weight. To be ""faster"" it must be ""lighter"". For this reason the R&D team of Aerospace Science and Industry boldly proposed to reduce the size and weight of the safety mechanism to one-fifth of the existing products which was almost ""crazy"".  The team members carried out nearly 50 tests and debugging and finally realized the upgrade of technology and materials and obtained a national defense patent. According to the assessment by an expert group composed of eight academicians including Bao Weimin and Long Yinhao the carrier coefficient of the ""Kaizhou"" rocket has reached the international leading level.

In the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake the road traffic between the disaster area and the outside world was blocked and the traditional ground communication was completely interrupted. However the space communication monitoring system at that time was unable to quickly give the disaster area casualties and various types of features in the disaster area providing information for disaster assessment and disaster relief decision-making. The basis was even harder to mention. ""It would be great if there were a pair of'sky eyes' that could see the disaster area clearly!"" This has become the voice of the people and was also remembered by the aerospace science and engineering researchers. Five years later on September 25 2013 the ""Kaizhou-1"" test satellite was successfully launched in Jiuquan. ""Kaizhou"" made the country's rapid deployment of ""Sky Eye"" a reality earthquake relief emergency support and environmental monitoring From the moment it enters orbit the ""Kaizhou-1"" satellite has become one of the busiest satellites in space. During the Ludian earthquake in Yunnan in 2014 ""Kaizhou-1"" was the only satellite in my country that carried out revisiting and revisiting the disaster area for more than ten days. It successfully acquired 75 remote sensing images of the earthquake area with high resolution totaling 75 scenes in total. 56.34GB all of which were distributed online to all relevant business units at the first time providing strong support for earthquake disaster monitoring and disaster assessment.

The image data obtained by ""Kaizhou-1"" were initially applied in the agricultural monitoring of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. In addition the distribution of small coal mines and small oil refineries snowmelt floods sensitive infrastructure and regional and environmental pollution sources are all within the monitoring scope of ""Kaizhou No. 1"". They are obtained through geographic environmental information to provide information for meteorological and environmental monitoring departments.

In September 2013 as soon as the ""Kaizhou-1"" satellite arrived in space before it had time to orbit the earth a few times it received a mission from the National Remote Sensing Center of the Ministry of Science and Technology: to image the earthquake-stricken area in Balochistan Pakistan. Provide support for disaster relief. A month later it provided support for the disaster assessment of the earthquake area in Hualien Taiwan and opened the way for humanitarian relief.

On February 16 2016 the Fourth Academy of Aerospace Science and Industry registered and established Aerospace Science and Industry Rocket Technology Co. Ltd. in Yangluo Economic Development Zone Xinzhou District Wuhan Hubei in order to comply with the development trend of commercial aerospace. The main business is the rocket launch service in the commercial direction at home and abroad especially the research and development manufacturing sales and service of the ""Quick Boat"" series of small solid launch vehicles. ""Kaizhou-2"" adopts the first international star and arrow integration technology which can realize rapid integration rapid testing and rapid launch; it was the first in China to adopt grid rudder control technology which was the first in China with rapid integration and rapid orbital capabilities. The small solid launch vehicle created by China created the fastest record for Chinas space launch which has expanded Chinas space launch vehicle from a liquid launch vehicle to a solid launch vehicle and initially formed the rapid response capability China urgently needs.

""Kaizhou-2"" was the final battle of the corresponding projects of the National 863 Program which was related to whether scientific research and technological innovation can be successfully transformed into engineering. ""Kaizhou"" has fulfilled the dream of rapid satellite launch of the Aerospace Science and Industry for more than 10 years And also cultivated a new force to prop up the national sky - China's first space rapid response equipment development team.

The KZ-1A launch vehicle (KZ-1A) has a ""three-stage solid power + final stage liquid boost"" tandem layout with a total length of 19.5m a take-off mass of about 30t and a fairing diameter of 1.4m. Depending on the launch orbit it can launch objects weighing 200kg~300kg to the sky (the volume parameters are not found but there should be restrictions). The biggest feature of the Kuaizhou series of rockets is that they are fast. They once set a high-speed record of two consecutive launches within 6 hours.

The price is very competitive internationally. There are more than a dozen orders in the past two years alone. According to Xinhuanet in international commercial launches small-scale launches are generally quoted at US$25000 to US$40000 per kilogram while the price of ""Kaizhou-1A"" rocket is less than US$20000 and the price of ""Kaizhou-11"" Less than 10000 US dollars. In other words for the launch service of a Kuaizhou-1A carrier rocket the normal selling price of a full load should be between 30 million and 40 million yuan based on the total weight of the carrier.

China's solid-fueled KuaiZhou-1A (KZ-1A) Y11 carrier rocket blasted off at 11:40 am on 13 November 2019 and successfully sent the Jilin-1 Gaofen 02A satellite into planned orbit from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Northwest China's Gansu Province. This was KZ-1A's second launch mission in 2019 the first time the KZ-1A has achieved multiple launches within one year and the fourth commercial launch of KZ-1A maintaining a 100 percent success record of commercial launches CASIC said.

Two global multimedia satellites were sent into planned orbit from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China on 17 November 2019. The two global multimedia satellites KL-a-A and KL-a-B was launched by Kuaizhou-1A (KZ-1A) a carrier rocket at 6:00 p.m. (Beijing Time). The two satellites are international cooperative commercial projects delivered by the Innovation Academy for Microsatellites of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. They are mainly used for the Ka-band communication technology test and the user was a German company. KZ-1A was a low-cost solid-fuel carrier rocket with high reliability and a short preparation period. The rocket developed by a company under the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation was mainly used to launch low-orbit microsatellites. The launch was the third mission for KZ-1A this year.

Successful launch of the Yinhe-1 by a KZ-1A rocket around 03:02 UTC 16 January 2020 at the Jiuquan space center. The low-orbit communication satellite uses the Q / V and Ka bands to reach a bandwidth of 10Gbps.

Columnist

As we enjoy our few cool weeks of spring we hit one last cold snap that brought in a good bit of rain … but it has otherwise been a very dry month. The dry warm weather invites the pest and disease problems that we struggle with through our hot Florida summers.

One such issue has gotten a lot of attention this year the tussock moth. Marion and surrounding counties have seen large infestations of them already over the last 2-3 weeks; they have defoliated our oak trees covered the front of our Extension building and decimated vegetables at a local organic farm. Other areas have seen relatively few of these pests.

Thankfully at the peak of our infestation I received an email from our Marion County forester Greg Barton and Jeffrey Eickwort state entomologist with the Florida Forest Service with some great tips for residents experiencing these inundations that I wanted to share. Although the tussock moth infestations occur every spring they occur at different times in different areas. It is likely that this will occur in more northern counties in the coming weeks. The primary species is the fir tussock moth (Orgyia detrita) which feeds mainly on the young spring leaves of live oak trees.

Common questions from residents:

Will they kill my tree? Answer: No. Tussock moths are only eating foliage and do not otherwise impact the twigs or stems. Healthy trees generally tolerate the leaf-loss and quickly replace the lost leaves. There are no long-term health effects and the caterpillar population will eventually be controlled by natural enemies.

Do they sting? Answer: Yes the caterpillars do have urticating (stinging) hairs but the effect is mild compared to some other “stinging” caterpillars and not medically significant. Some sensitive individuals may have a more noticeable reaction but basic first aid (mild soap and water topical treatments) should be sufficient for most people.

What should I spray? Answer: Generally nothing. The caterpillars are usually noticed when they are finished feeding and in their “wandering” phase looking for a place to spin a cocoon. That’s too late for insecticides to be effective since they have become so spread out. The caterpillars will soon be gone until next year.

If you would like more information about tussock moths you can find it in this publication from the University of Florida: https://tinyurl.com/78tt7u9m

Additional concerns that we are starting to see in our Extension office plant clinic include aphids army worms stink bugs and leaf footed bugs. If you have a vegetable garden started you may want to carefully scout for these and other insects. If you are supporting a butterfly garden be sure to purchase plants that are free of pesticide residues and do not use chemicals that may lead to the demise of your butterflies. If you have plant or insect pest questions please check in with your local UF/IFAS Extension Office for the hours of their Master Gardener Plant Clinic or Help Desk.

Lastly don’t forget that spring mean hurricane season is fast approaching. Start checking out your trees. Look for dead limbs decay diseased trees mushroom conks and bleeding from the trunk to indicate possible trouble on the horizon. If you have a problematic tree that is near your home consider getting it removed before we are in the path of a storm. Also consider planting a new tree that is an appropriate mature size and species for the location to replace any trees that are being removed. Good trees add significant value to your property bad trees are a risk and liability.

We currently track 218 animals in Estonia and are adding more every day!

Estonia is one of the least inhabited countries in Europe. Its population of 1.3 million people is spread out over some 17.5 million square miles leaving its beaches pasturelands marshes and forests largely untenanted by human beings though not by wildlife. Estonia abounds with interesting mammalian species like Eurasian lynx wild boars brown bears moose flying squirrels beavers and grey wolves. While these fauna is not unique to Estonia they are comparatively rare in other parts of Europe.

Estonia is also widely heralded as one of the world’s great bird-watching destinations. It’s situated on the great East-Atlantic migratory pathway used by swans geese ducks divers cranes and Arctic waterfowl. All in all Estonia is home to 64 distinct mammalian species and more than 300 species of birds.

The Official National Animal of Estonia

Estonia definitely has a love/hate relationship with its official national animal the grey wolf. Estonian legends about the predatory behavior of these canny undomesticated canines date back to medieval times. But while wolves may play predators in Estonian fables there hasn’t been a recorded wolf attack upon humans in more than 150 years. As of 2018 there were approximately 260 wolves in Estonia divided into 20 to 25 packs. Estonian wolves live in remote wilderness areas where it is legal to hunt them as a way of keeping their numbers down as biologists say the optimal number of wolves is 200 animals.

Where To Find The Top Wild Animals in Estonia

Estonia has five outstanding national parks where many varieties of rare fauna can be spotted:

Lahemaa National Park: Lahemaa National Park in northern Estonia contains forest and wetland habitats that are home to moose brown bears wolves red deer Eurasian lynx and other rare animals. Not only is Lahemaa Estonia’s largest national park but it’s also one of the largest national parks in Europe. Lahemaa is fewer than 50 miles distant from the capital city Tallinn so it’s easy for a tourist to Estonia to add a visit to his or her itinerary.

Korvemaa Nature Reserve: Korvemaa Nature Reserve is Estonia’s premier birdwatching destination where lucky visitors may catch a glimpse of endangered species like the black stork the heather cock or the golden eagle. The reserve is also home to grey wolves brown bears Eurasian lynx and other wildlife. Once European mink abounded here but the local mink population is now thought to be extinct from over-trapping and habitat erosion.

Soomaa National Park: For much of the year Soomaa National Park in the Estonian fen country is only accessible by kayak or canoe. This is a great place to observe the country’s beaver population as well as elk wild boar brown bear grey wolf and Eurasian lynx.

Matsalu National Park: Matsalu National Park was founded as a bird sanctuary in 1957. It’s been estimated that more than 2 million waterfowl fly over Matsalu Bay every year including swans; goldeneye bluebill and tufted ducks; and barnacle and graylag geese. All told more than 250 bird species have been identified at Matsalu National Park during the migration season.

Vilsandi National Park: Vilsandi grew from an avian preserve that was founded in 1910. It consists of more than 150 islands in the Baltic Sea that provide nesting grounds for nearly 250 bird species.

The Most Dangerous Animals In Estonia Today

Estonia is home to a number of animals that can be dangerous if they’re provoked.

Grey wolves: While unprovoked attacks by healthy wolves are not completely unknown the vast majority of wolves pose no threats to human safety. Wolves may be predators but they prefer to steer clear of humans.

Eurasian lynx: Although cornered lynx will defend itself with tooth and claw these wild cats typically avoid people. In fact humans present more of a threat to lynx than lynx do to people: In certain parts of the world lynx are still trapped for their pelts.

Brown bears: Brown bears generally avoid human beings but they are known for their unpredictable temperaments. Unprovoked attacks are not completely unknown so they must be classified as potentially dangerous predators. Female bears with cubs can be particularly aggressive.

Adders: Estonia is also to the species of snake known as the adder. These snakes are considered an endangered species in Estonia and are under legal protection. They generally try to elude humans but will bite if they’re picked up. Adder bites are uncomfortable but only require hospitalization in a small number of cases.

Endangered Animals In Estonia

Destruction of forest and meadow habitats means that several Estonian fauna specimens are in danger of becoming extinct. These include mammals birds and insects.

The Eurasian otter

The European mink

The garden dormouse

The flying squirrel

The greater spotted eagle

The red-footed falcon

The small lappet moth

Simply put Colin the Caterpillar is an icon.

Other caterpillar cakes try and compare but none will ever reach the status of the famous M&S chocolate log cake.

With Colin the Caterpillar becoming something of a mini-brand for M&S it's a no brainer that they'd want to push the boat out and introduce some offspring for the famous insect.

That's exactly what the supermarket has done with their brand new offering: a Colin the Caterpillar cake jar apparently with the same iconic taste packed into a handy little jar to eat on the go.

With a new Colin variation on the block naturally I had to question whether the cake jar could really compare to the real thing.

I wanted to see how the two held up against each other.

Is a caterpillar really a caterpillar when he's squashed up in a little plastic cylinder? Can the cake really be as good when there's less of it?

These were some of the questions I set out to answer choosing to take on the new cake jar days after its release and see whether it really was a good smaller alternative to the original.

First of all these cake jars are naturally very popular having just come out.

As well as the Colin the Caterpillar flavour there's also raspberry ripple and trillionaire's but the hype for those two alone can't compare to the buzz around the famous chocolate insect cake.

All three flavours were sold out in the first M&S I tried but luckily the second store local to me had some of the £4 cake-away alternatives.

Preparing to pit the cake against the jar I cut myself a slice of the original Colin the Caterpillar to remind myself just how good it was before I tried something all new.

The staple of any birthday it's always a treat to take a bite into the rolled chocolate sponge and taste the hard chocolate icing shell around it.

As tasty as ever I know it would be hard for the new young thing to compare.

I had been thinking about these jars all week since finding out they'd been released and couldn't wait to tuck in now I finally had one in my possession.

Despite the excitement I have also been hesitant about the jars since seeing them blow up on social media in the last few days.

(Image: SussexLive)

With all credit to M&S admittedly I just didn't think a mass produced supermarket cake jar would be as good as the homemade ones I get in my local cake and dessert store and expected it to taste slightly processed and artificial.

I was proven so wrong about so many things by this cake jar.

Take a seat because I'm making a statement - the cake jar is far superior to the original caterpillar cake.

The quality compared to the regular cake is off the charts. I didn't need to worry about it feeling too mass-produced compared to a local home-baked shop.

That's not to say it tastes exactly like something hand crafted by a bakery but it exceeded all my expectations and tasted better than any cupcake or full-sized birthday cake I've ever had from a supermarket.

(Image: SussexLive)

The cake itself inside the jar is a lot more spongy and fresh compared to the long party cake the icing looks and tastes richer too.

On the packaging the jar says it contains a ""chocolate sponge cake layered with white and milk chocolate chips chocolate ganache and a milk chocolate Colin the Caterpillar face"".

It's definitely the ganache that shines in the jar - there is a lot more icing packed into the portioned tub compared to what's on a standard slice of the cake.

The one thing it lacked compared to the original is the crispy chocolate buttons that usually decorate Colin's back.

Still it's safe to say the cake jar is a clear winner when it comes to taste and quality.

I definitely won't ever give up on the original Colin though - he became an iconic trademark for M&S for a reason.

(Image: SussexLive)

When it comes to a birthday party or a celebration you can't beat the long chocolate log cake. Even if it tastes slightly inferior it's an essential.

It would just be wrong to roll out some cake jars with candles in them at a birthday party. Imagine the scenes.

The great thing about the cake jar is that you can have everything you love about the classic party staple in a portion much easier to finish perfect if you just want a sweet treat to pick at after dinner.

Fair play M&S sometimes new really is better.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGRjb2FzdGZjLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzLzkwNDI4OC9yb2ItY2hhcnRlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rob Charter,"Rob Charter who lives on the Gold Coast retired in 2018 following a distinguished career with Caterpillar Inc - the world’s largest construction equipment manufacturer – that spanned nearly 30 years.

The landowner declined an interview with CBC London however he provided written statements to seven questions.

Answers have been edited for brevity. CBC London has also fact-checked some statements which can be viewed at the bottom of this story.

1/ Why are some of your commercial buildings in the downtown core vacant? What is the vacancy rate for your downtown holdings?

Farhi Holdings has been a marquee investor and partner in downtown London. Our recent achievements include the attraction of twelve new tenants who employ about 2200 Londoners in offices on or near Dundas Place such as the Bell building which has parking. We have increased our occupancy footprint by more than 300000 square feet in the past two years alone. Some examples include:

441 Ridout (leased to Blyth Academy).

210 Dundas Street (leased to the London Free Press).

215 Dundas Street (leased to Grace Restaurant).

383 Richmond Street (former Royal Bank tower. Tenants undisclosed).

379 Dundas Street (known as London Towers. Leased to a variety of businesses).

Unfortunately any buildings that have no reserved parking will have a small chance to be considered by future tenants.

A few short months ago we were approached by two brokers to tour two potential tenants. One of them was seeking 45000 sq. ft. and needed 450 parking spots and another tenant needed 32000 sq. ft. with 250 parking spots. Combined they needed 680 reserved parking spots.

Unfortunately all those heritage buildings on Dundas Street were built decades ago without any thought for parking.

The former London public library on Queens Avenue is a heritage building built in 1939. Farhi Holdings Corporation bought it front the city in 2005. It's been empty ever since. (Andrew Lupton/CBC)

Empty buildings are costly. It's particularly difficult because we have invested significant amounts of money in restoration and upkeep of these properties.

Since 2010 we have been talking to the city that if they really want to see a healthy downtown then we need a moratorium on office developments in the suburbs until we have a low vacancy rate downtown.

Unfortunately I am still talking to the city and in the meantime we lost ten years and thousands of employees in our core to the outskirts.

2/ What is your plan for the three buildings at the intersection of Richmond and Dundas?

One corner of Dundas and Richmond streets in London Ont.. Farhi Holdings Corporation owns this lot as well as two others on adjacent corners. All three buildings are empty. (Amanda Margison/ CBC News)

Our brokers at Cushman & Wakefield CBRE and the team at Farhi Holdings Corporation (FHC) are working diligently to put tenants into those buildings and any other vacant buildings that we have.

3/ What is your plan for the farmland you own?

To farm them and utilize the agricultural goods for our local restaurants. The land is leased for agricultural purposes. I can't speak to what farmers choose to grow or how they farm the land.

Land use is dictated by the city through its official plan. I am proud to see the land put to its highest and best use which is productive farmland. We admire the hard work and dedication that farmers bring to the region.

4/ Some suggest you're a land speculator that you buy and hold properties. How do you respond?

I do sell property. Below you will find a few examples:

332-338 Richmond Street

This building was known as the Clifton Arms Hotel in 1878. We purchased this building in 1986 when it was in poor condition and completed major heritage restoration work thereby repositioning the property to accommodate 28 residential units.

I am happy to advise you that with our assistance and a donation of over $1M we turned this building to Youth Opportunities Unlimited and it is now known as the Cornerstone.

The current home of Youth Opportunities Unlimited (YOU) was opened as the Clifton Arms Hotel in 1878. Farhi Holdings Corporation bought the building in 1986 when it was in poor condition. He sold to YOU in 2007. (Shumel Farhi)

343-349 Richmond Street

This beautiful heritage building underwent major restoration work by creating loft apartments throughout the building. We have provided a substantial donation of $1.2M to the worthy organization of Atlohsa Family Healing Services who now owns the building for several years.

534 Queens Ave

We sold this building to a Toronto company in 2014.

The Canadian Mental Health Association began leasing 534 Queens Ave. in 2006 from FHC. The building was sold to TKFV Holdings Ltd. CMHA continues to lease it. (Kate Dubinski/CBC)

197-199 Dundas Street

This building underwent a major retrofit interior and exterior. We did this work because we had two government tenants who signed a lease and wanted to relocate to this building.

We sold this building to a company in 2014. Several years later both the provincial and federal governments left the premises.

From what we know they left for the same reasons the city identified as problems in the Core Area Action Plan.

Farhi Holdings Corporation sold this building west of Clarence Ave. to an undisclosed buyer in 2014. (Shmuel Farhi)

5/ If you're facing challenges developing or finding tenants for some of your downtown properties — as you are on the record saying — would you be willing to work with the city to come up with solutions to make it possible? What could the city do differently to aid commercial downtown developers like yourself?

We have and will continue to be interested in engaging with the city to find solutions.

The city should do everything they can to encourage prospective tenants to lease downtown properties. Like us we need the city to serve tenant needs.

6/ What do you like about London? Why do you continue to invest here?

London is a very special place for me. Although I am an entrepreneur with many business interests throughout Ontario London remains near and dear to my heart. It's where I live it's where my family lives it's where I continue to raise my children and where I have chosen to locate my business office.

There are so many positives to downtown London including beautiful parks riverbanks heritage buildings and sites sporting and music venues and award-winning bars and restaurants.

7/ Why not sell the heritage buildings in London that have stood empty for years (the former library at 305 Queens Ave. the Wright Lithographic building at 424 Wellington St.) and let someone else try to develop them?

We had several tenants interested in the library over the years. One of them Citi Financial needed several hundred parking spaces. The city was gracious enough to assist us with some parking at a cost across from London Hydro but that was too far away.

We had another interested party in 2007/08 but due to the collapse of the financial and banking sector in 2008 they put everything on hold.

In 2008/09 we provided a proposal for the Renal Dialysis Satellite Clinic at London Health Sciences Centre to house them at the old library (305 Queens) and 100 Dundas at the Bell Building. Unfortunately they decided to locate at Westmount Shopping Centre.

This photo taken in April 2018 shows the clock and lettering intact. Now the windows are boarded up and the clock is gone. (Andrew Lupton/CBC)

Now celebrating its first anniversary the agency is seizing a chance to to leave behind the exposed brick walls and industrial-style ceilings staff fell in love with -- not because they're working remotely but because the time is right to lock in a deal.

""Frankly we've outgrown it already so we actually need to find more space but we are looking at the right time"" said Beverley Hammond a partner and chief business officer at the agency which is hiring so much that it's run out of room.

A number of growing companies are searching for new offices even as the pandemic has forced closures and downsizing elsewhere.

Some businesses are shifting to larger offices months or years before they anticipate outgrowing their current locations. simply because market conditions are so favourable. With more commercial space available prospective tenants have gained negotiating power.

""There are a lot of companies right now that are accelerating through this challenge"" said Jon Ramscar Toronto downtown managing director for commercial real estate company CBRE.

The national office vacancy rate climbed to 13.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020 CBRE reported. That's the country's highest available amount office space since 2004.

That grew to 14.6 per cent for the first quarter of 2021 up from 10.3 per cent at the same time last year which covers the period before the worst of pandemic's economic effects hit.

Some cities appear to be coping: vacancy rates in Vancouver Waterloo and Ottawa rates were as low as 6.3 9.3 and 9.6 per cent respectively for the first quarter. But in Alberta where the devastated oil industry combined with the broader downturn more than one in four Calgary offices and one in five Edmonton properties remain vacant.

Toronto's 12.4 vacancy rate is double what it was a year ago -- and up from 10.9 per cent last quarter.

While continuous shifts in COVID-19-related public health measures make it difficult to offer an outlook for the sector Ramscar says the gradual reopening of the country will lead to decreased rates in areas like Toronto.

It's not clear how long remote work practices will continue and much of the vacant property is available through subleases. It ""could cool off the market very quickly if companies decide they want their space back as they explore cost mitigation strategies"" Ramscar warned.

Wojtek Dabrowski managing partner at Provident Communications Inc. was quick to act early in the pandemic when there was a shift to people working from home and he learned of an available space twice the size of the firm's current office in the same building.

Dabrowski reached out to the landlord who agreed to make a deal.

""We said we're not going to pay you full rate because we're just not in the office day to day [...] but we think that there's a way to work this out if you're open to negotiating a little bit"" he recalled.

While Dabrowski and his colleagues weren't in the office during the pandemic as much as they were prior he was confident the team would want to return when vaccination is widespread and restrictions ease.

Some companies are preparing for staff to never return particularly in the tech sector. Shopify Inc. Twitter Inc. and OpenText Inc. are keeping some offices but launched permanent work from home policies during the pandemic.

Broken Heart Love Affair says the collaborative nature of its business makes in-person work attractive. A staff survey found the majority were eager to be back in a space together as soon as the pandemic allows.

Hammond however is warning workers that the larger space they settle into when the agency's lease is up in July might not be what they're used to though they are looking for places with character like its current location.

Hammond says there's a good chance they'll set up in a former store restaurant or bar because those are among the most available locations.

She envisions converting any of those kinds of properties to a working area and perhaps offering space to clients.

While her hunt has only just begun she's excited about the possibilities.

""There's going to be a lot of vacancy in retail and maybe there's a way that we can start to bring some life back.""

The 4.26km scenic track which was inaugurated in 1964 is located in the province of Quebec. It twice hosted the Canadian Grand Prix with McLaren's Denny Hulme winning the event in 1968 and Ferrari's Jacky Ickx triumphing in 1970.

The complex was acquired by Stroll in 2000 and redesigned by track architect Alan Wilson who modernized the venue and brought its safety features up to FIA standards.

Circuit Mont-Tremblant underwent another major renovation in 2004 that allowed it to hold more national and continental events. In 2007 the track hosted a round of the IndyCar Champ Car World Series.

It current holds an FIA Grade 2 licence and is reportedly profitable thanks in large part to the many track days held at the site.

Overall the circuit's property covers 304 acres and Canadian real-estate group CBRE has been mandated by Stroll to handle the sale with the company reportedly hoping to sell the asset for an estimated 22 million Canadian dollars.

A woman who worked for more than four years as a sheriff's dispatcher in Louisiana was fired and arrested after authorities say she refused to return more than $1.2 million that was accidentally deposited into her account.

According to a report Thursday from Nola.com the 33-year-old Kelyn Spadoni of Harvey Louisiana was arrested Wednesday and charged with theft valued over $25000 bank fraud and illegal transmission of monetary funds over accusations that she repeatedly evaded requests to return funds inadvertently transferred to her in February.

Spadoni is said to be accused of transferring the funds to another account and using the money to purchase a house and a 2021 Hyundai Genesis valued somewhere between $48000 and $70000.

Charles Schwab & Co. filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Spadoni who worked as a 911 dispatcher saying she ignored its attempts to reach her by calls text messages and emails. The company said it once contacted her workplace but was told she was unable to come to the phone.

She opened her account with Schwab in January the lawsuit said.

According to the lawsuit filed in US District Court in the Eastern District of Louisiana Schwab intended to transfer $82.56 into a Fidelity account owned by Spadoni when it accidentally transferred more than $1.2 million because of an ""issue created by a software enhancement."" In the lawsuit the company said its terms of service required customers to return any money inadvertently transferred to them.

The lawsuit says the company attempted to get the money back the following day but was told the funds were no longer in the Fidelity account because Spadoni had moved them to another account.

She was also fired by the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office – where she had worked for more than four years – following her arrest.

Authorities said a clerical error had caused Charles Schwab a major financial services corporation to deposit the seven-figure sun into her brokerage account when it only meant to transfer about $82 in February nola.com reported.

When the bank attempted to reclaim the money the request was rejected because the money was not available according to the sheriff’s office.

The 33-year-old is accused of immediately moving the funds to another account and using some of the money to buy a new car and a house authorities said.

Sheriff’s spokesman Capt. Jason Rivarde said that although the money was put into her account “it’s not her money.”

“She has no legal claim to that money” he added. “Even if it was put in there by mistake. It was an accounting error.”

Charles Schwab & Co. sued Spadoni on Tuesday in federal court.

Nola.com published a picture of Spadoni who’s being held on a $50000 bond

The company tried to contact her several times to have the transferred funds returned but were unsuccessful according to Rivarde.

So far about 75 per cent of the money has been recovered he added.

The company argued in its lawsuit that Spadoni’s account contract with Schwab includes an agreement that if a client receives an overpayment of funds the client is required to return the full amount.

“If someone accidentally puts an extra zero on a utility payment they would want that money returned or credited to them. This is no different” Rivarde said.

Spadoni is being held at the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center on a $50000 bond. It was unknown if she has an attorney who could speak on her behalf."

It’s no secret that major corporations rely on tax loopholes to reduce their tax bill and maximize total income. A new report by the Institute of Tax and Economic Policy says that in 2020 55 major companies paid $0 in federal income tax despite collectively earning over $40 billion.

See: Should the Minimum Wage Be $15? Take Our PollFind: Fortune 500 Companies That Haven’t Paid Federal Taxes Recently

Consumer Services Energy and Communications Lead Zero Income-Tax List

The 55 companies identified by the non-profit think tank are among some of the best known brands in the world. In the consumer services section alone companies like Charter Communications (the parent of Spectrum Internet) Dish Network FedEx HP and Nike all either paid $0 in taxes or received a refund.

Energy companies were also among the major sectors that did not pay into the community chest. American Electric Power Consolidated Edison Duke Energy FirstEnergy and Xcel Energy all had either a $0 bill or a negative effective tax rate. Other big brands on the list were motor vehicle conglomerate Penske Automotive Group software giant Salesforce.com and microchip manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices.

How are the companies able to get away without paying taxes? According to the report the decades-long trend was accelerated by the passage of the CARES Act in 2020. Although the bill provided economic stimulus payments to Americans it also allowed companies to “carry back” losses from up to five years to offset income usually taxed at 35%. This allowance created $500 million in tax breaks allowing at least four companies to get to a zero-balance on their tax bill.

Other companies used creative accounting to wipe away some of their tax liability. Over 10 used executive stock option breaks to reduce their tax bills by writing off stock-option-related expenses. At least six companies used federal research and experimentation credits to significantly cut down their tax bill.

The ITEP report comes on the heels of another investigation suggesting that America’s highest earners are responsible for over one-third of unpaid taxes. A National Bureau of Economic Research working paper suggests the wealthiest 1% may be using technology and other creative means to obfuscate their true income.

A wall of classic records. Mounted electric guitars. Coyote Blues offers one of the best Mexican-infused eats in Jackson. Located on Union University Drive Coyote Blues is a self-professed Louisiana-infused and Mexican-inspired restaurant with a large variety of dishes and drinks.

As a native Arizonian and a foodie that makes meals from scratch in my dorm room kitchen on the regular to say I’m picky about my Mexican food would be an understatement. I tend to appreciate the simplicity of traditional Mexican dishes (sorry Tex-Mex lovers) so I was hesitant the first time I tried Coyote Blues’ Cajun-Mexican fusion. But I was pleasantly surprised by the elegant balance of classic southern and traditional Mexican found in Coyote Blues’ dishes. The menu boasts Mexican infused shrimp and grits queso-smothered Milagros shrimp po’ boy with chipotle aioli smoked duck nachos and so many other classic favorites (not to mention their banger homemade guac with pueblo chips).

Along with the fantastic food the atmosphere of the restaurant is well-developed with touches of deep southern country décor throughout the building.

“Coyote Blues has an upscale eclectic vibe that that captures the blues and country music culture in a tasteful way” said Danielle Popson sophomore business major.

But it isn’t just the food and atmosphere that makes Coyote Blues a special restaurant for me. Throughout the past year I’ve had some important memories in their restaurant. I remember trying their Milagros for the first time with my mom when she helped move me in for my junior year of college in August 2020. Coming off the back of an especially difficult spring semester leaving my family for the fall semester was hard and the whole move in process seemed a little more bitter than sweet. During her last night in Jackson with me before saying goodbye we went out to eat at Coyote Blues.

Later in the fall I came back with one of my best friends Cayla Cohen junior elementary education major on election night. As we talked about our fears and hopes for the future I remember wondering if they would call the election while we were in the restaurant. Of course the election wasn’t called until several days later but that didn’t stop us from filling our faces with queso in anticipation.

While Danielle Popson sophomore business major and I worked through a marketing project crunching numbers and swimming in spreadsheet data with our laptops plugged in at the bar this March the waitress was as sweet as ever ensuring we had a steady influx of chips and salsa to get us through.

Throughout each of these memories Coyote Blues offered the perfect environment for conversation: an appealing atmosphere wonderful service and great food enough to make this foodie come back for more and enjoy it every time.

Nearly a year since opening the establishment’s owners are planning for a busy summer introducing the the brand’s laid back atmosphere to the region in what would hopefully be the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We are trying to give people a little escape” said Tim Dene Costa Vida’s managing partner. “We want to help people to step away from the daily grind and offer them a fresh meal and feel like you might be at the beach.”

Uptick in sales

Located within the Crossings of Spring Hill shopping center Costa Vida first began serving customers in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic starting in July 2020. Now nearly a year since first opening the operation has found stable footing with a steady flow of customers.

Equipped with a drive through business continued while keeping physical contact to a minimum.

“It has been well received and we are excited for the summertime” Dene said. “We have seen an uptick in sales. It's looking good. We are excited about.”

With an interior that reflects the sunny California coast with tables that remind visitors of classic surfboards Dene said the new restaurant offers a setting and menu that complements Tennessee’s warm summer months.

“This is Mexican-inspired fresh food” he added. “We make everything in-house we don’t use freezers and we are cooking fresh food and deluging it to customers everyday.”

Making a home in Spring Hill

Owned and operated by three business partners who call Spring Hill home the Costa Vida's Maury County operation marks the first introduction of the Utah-based franchise in Tennessee.

Blake Haines the franchise holder of the region’s Sonic Drive-In Restaurants is also a partner.

The restaurant is the first to open east of the Mississippi.

Founded in 2003 in Layton Utah by JD Gardner and Sarah Gardner the Costa Vida franchise has expanded its presence across the western United States and Canada through a series of franchise agreements.

More than 80 locations have opened in Utah Arizona California Kansas Idaho New Mexico Minnesota Missouri Montana Oregon Washington and Wyoming.

The restaurant also has three locations near the Canadian city of Calgary.

“It is a brand new concept to the area” Dene said who shared that the plan is to open at least four locations in Nashville and other spots in the south.

He said the Spring Hill location marks a strong start for the business.

“We wanted our first one to be our home base and it has worked out well for us” Dene said. “We felt most comfortable being somewhere to check the pulse of the restaurant and for people to go out and enjoy it.”

What to try at Costa Vida

Costa Vida offers a selection of popular standards: burritos salads enchiladas nachos and quesadillas are all made to order with a selection of fresh meats vegetables and flavorful toppings served with house-made tortillas.

The restaurant’s popular two-pound burrito filled with the restaurant’s signature sweet pork will keep the hungriest of customers satisfied.

Customers have a choice of meats prepared in-house.

It’s tender sweet pork is first seared and then braised in cola offering a sweet and savory flavor.

The shredded beef is brined for 24 hours and then slow-braised for a smooth taste and texture.

The Baja Bowl offers a choice of meat served on a bed of cilantro-lime rice and beans garnished with lettuce and pico de gallo.

“It’s great fresh food made every day” Dene said.

Dishing It Out is an ongoing series on southern Middle Tennessee’s culinary offerings. Email Multimedia Editor Mike Christen at mchristen@c-dh.net with your suggestions for places to go and food to try.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jYmouY29tL2Zvb2QvcGl0YS1waXRhLTEzbS1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWxhdW5jaC1leHBhbnNpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pita Pita $13M Investment to Launch Expansion,"Pita Pita Inc. founder and President Haitham Hammad enlisted his mother to help create the culinary profile of his Mediterranean concept. Now he’s looking to bring those flavors to the national stage.



The Laguna Hills-based company recently announced a $13 million investment—its first from an outside source—from Samer Fakhouri executive chairman of Jordan’s Al Eqbal Real Estate Development and Triumph Venture Capital. The funding will help push the four-restaurant concept to open 20 locations over the next three years.



It’s a rapid expansion plan for the OC restaurant brand which started in 2010 and seeks to make a name for itself in the fast-casual market for Mediterranean food with a focus on what it says is fresh simple and authentic Mediterranean cuisine.



“There’s a lot of people—they slap Mediterranean or Middle Eastern on their restaurant” said Hammad who hails from Jordan. “There’s quite a few out there but it’s the authenticity of the food. I don’t want to give you baba ghanoush that doesn’t taste like baba ghanoush.”



Hammad worked at banks and in IT up until 2010 when he decided to try his hand at the restaurant industry.



“My wife thought I was the craziest guy rightfully so. It was really challenging” he recalled of the company’s start. “The good thing was the common business sense and whatever experience from corporate helped me navigate through the challenges.”



He was also guided by a desire to create a concept that he would have no problem taking his kids to multiple times a week.



“The food is clean. The food is fresh. Whatever we have in our [Pita Pita] kitchen I assure you have in your house—lemon juice salt olive oil” he pointed out.



“It’s home cooking in a restaurant and that was my goal.”



A Brand to Scale



The company hopes Pita Pita’s menu and flavors will help differentiate the brand as it pushes to open more locations.



“The type of food that we offer and the experience that we offer with our restaurants we feel that that could be very easily well received around the United States” said Chief Operating Officer Ramy Elguindy.



“As unique as our food is it’s still a very palatable flavor profile. We absolutely 100% want to be a national brand” Elguindy said. “What Chipotle did for Mexican cuisine we want to do for Mediterranean cuisine.”



The company’s most recent restaurant opening last month was in Newport Beach a 1600-square-foot spot on MacArthur Boulevard not far from John Wayne Airport.



Another four spots are set to open this year with the focus on near-term growth in the regional market between Los Angeles and San Diego.



Average checks are $18 per person which includes food and a drink. The company declined to say what the business is projected to do in sales this year. It was down last year due to the pandemic and shelter-in-place orders.



The aforementioned Newport Beach-based Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (NYSE: CMG) at over 2750 restaurants and a recent market cap of $39.6 billion is an ambitious goal to aim to run alongside.



Elguindy would know. He was a general manager of a Chipotle in Santa Monica before becoming managing partner at Mendocino Farms director of operations at Mainland Poke and director of operations at Dave’s Hot Chicken.



Longer term the company could consider franchising to reach its aspirations but the current focus is to build out and succeed with company-owned locations first Elguindy said.



“We’re thinking about both [franchised and company-owned locations]” he said. “But we know it’s our responsibility first to make sure that we have our ducks in a row. We know it’s our obligation if we decided to take it to franchise to be able to deliver internally on our own units and achieve the unit volumes. And once we have it in place [franchising’s] not off the table.”



He added that the infrastructure’s already there to be able to scale with franchisees.

Business Improvements



Pre-pandemic the decision was made to invest in technology and also a smaller footprint with restaurant sizes of under 1200 square feet moving forward. Restaurants to date are as large as 2500 square feet.



The recently opened Newport Beach store is a glimpse at that new model with “East Meets West” branding pickup cubbies for contactless takeout and integration with a new mobile app and revamped website that launched in mid-February 2020.



“Last year was extremely challenging” Hammad said. “We started the year really good. We were hitting numbers. Our February was the best February in 10 years and March was on the same track. By mid-March everything shut down and it was devastating in terms of the business.”



“The plan was to expand and go to a smaller footprint and focus on delivery and a digital presence” Hammad said. “That decision was made prior to the pandemic. The pandemic came and put this projection into the fast track.”



By mid-September the company switched to counter service from an assembly line. Much of the restaurant operations are now designed with third-party delivery in mind Elguindy said.



While industries are continuing to adapt to consumer behavior Pita Pita management sees the business well positioned to take on changes—even the unknowns.



“We still don’t have a full picture of how it’s going to be after this [pandemic] is all over” Hammad said. “But we are ready … the timing was perfect. If we lagged a little bit last year we probably would not be riding the wave we are on right now.”",,,

It was the music that changed first. Or maybe that's just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening. The choir director a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe. So much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls for a time were banned. At the parish elementary school students began hearing about abortion and hell. ""It was like a step back in time"" said one former parishioner still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity. It's not just St. Maria Goretti. Across the U.S. the Catholic Church is undergoing an immense shift. Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine. The shift molded by plummeting church attendance increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy has reshaped parishes across the country leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world. The changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence conservative Catholics remain a minority. Yet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.

The progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests surveys show are far more conservative. ""They say they're trying to restore what us old guys ruined"" said the Rev. John Forliti 87 a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education. Doug Koesel an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland was blunter: ""They're just waiting for us to die."" At St. Maria Goretti once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem. ""I don't want my daughter to be Catholic"" said Christine Hammond whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church's school and her daughter's classroom. ""Not if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming."" But this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new old church. They often stand out in the pews with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often at least a couple families will arrive with four five or even more children signaling their adherence to the church's ban on contraception which most American Catholics have long casually ignored. They attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions — more Latin more incense more Gregorian chants. ""We want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives"" said Ben Rouleau who until recently led St. Maria Goretti's young adult group which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil. They are Rouleau said happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison. ""It's radical in some ways"" Rouleau said. ""We're returning to the roots of the church.""

Three decades of progressive change If this movement emerged from anywhere it might be a now-demolished Denver football stadium and a borrowed military helicopter carrying in Pope John Paul II. Some 500000 people descended on Denver in 1993 for the Catholic festival World Youth Day. When the pope's helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium the ground shook from the stomping. The pope whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change. If the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare. On some issues John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers' rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness — ""the oxygen that purifies the air of hatred."" He forgave his own would-be assassin. But he was also uncompromising on dogma warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals. Catholics ""are in danger of losing their faith"" he told crowds at the final Denver Mass decrying abortion drug abuse and what he called ""sexual disorders"" a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights. Across the nation fervent young Catholics listened. Newman Centers which serve Catholic university students became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew particularly the cable TV network EWTN a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.

Today conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There's Sister Miriam James an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There's Jackie Francois Angel who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex marriage and Catholicism. There's Mike Schmitz a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine. Even today surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control. But increasingly those Catholics are not in church. In 1970 more than half of America's Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022 that had fallen to 17% according to CARA a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials the number is just 9%. Even as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million driven in part by immigration from Latin America ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church's most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440000 in 2021 CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds. The shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population. On the national level conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino's Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices. Then there's the priesthood. Young priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology so common in the 1960s and 70s have ""all but vanished"" said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University based on a survey of more than 3500 priests. Today's young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II tangling itself up in America's rapidly shifting views on everything from women's roles to LGBTQ people. ""There really aren't very many liberals in the seminaries anymore"" said a young recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. ""They wouldn't feel comfortable.""

Slow shift toward orthodoxy Sometimes the shift toward orthodoxy happens slowly. Maybe there's a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services or dropped completely. And sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them. ""You'd leave Mass thinking 'Holy cow! What just happened?'"" said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti whose family eventually left the church describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor and a sudden focus on sin and confession. Like many former parishioners he spoke only on condition of anonymity worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews. ""I'm a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday"" he said. ""But I'd never seen anything like this."" The new outlook has spilled across America. In churches from Minnesota to California parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings. Each can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America. But the movement whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic can be hard to define. It ranges from Catholics who want more incense to Latin Mass adherents who have brought back ancient prayers that mention ""the perfidious Jew."" There are right-wing survivalists celebrity exorcists environmentalists and a handful of quasi-socialists. There's the Catholic news outlet railing against the Vatican's ""wicked entourage"" and the small-town Wisconsin priest who traces COVID-19 to a century-old prophecy and warns of looming dictatorship. There's the recent ""Catholic Prayer for Trump"" a $1000-a-plate dinner at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort featuring a string of conspiracy theorists.

Yet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell. Looming over the American divide is Pope Francis who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive even as he toes the line on most dogma. The orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely. And the pope clearly worries about America. The U.S. church has ""a very strong reactionary attitude"" he told a group of Jesuits last year. ""Being backward-looking is useless."" A new vision of Catholic America You can find this new vision of Catholic America at Latin Masses in Milwaukee the pews crowded with worshippers even at noon on a weekday. It's in conferences held in California wine country at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington D.C. And it's at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River. At first glance nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College. Students worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre. But look deeper. Because at Benedictine Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography premarital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden. If these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age that hasn't stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges. At a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking Benedictine's expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop. Enrollment now about 2200 has doubled in 20 years. Students many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families jokingly call it ""the Benedictine bubble."" And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.

In a deeply secular America where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity. ""We don't all agree on everything obviously"" said John Welte a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. ""But I would say everyone has an understanding of like truth."" ""There are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right and this is wrong."" Sometimes people here quietly admit it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans. Very often talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas who believed God could be found in truth goodness and beauty. Sometimes they say that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants. ""It's a renewal of like some really really good things that we might have lost"" said Madeline Hays a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major. She takes the church's rules seriously from pre-marital sex to confession. She can't stand modern church architecture. She's seriously considering becoming a nun. But she also worries about poverty and America's wastefulness and the way Americans — including herself — can find themselves slotted into the political divide without even knowing it. She wrestles with her belief in an unerring Catholic doctrine that can see good people including some of her own friends as sinners. Yet she doesn't want change. ""The church wouldn't be the church if it changed things it had set down as 'This is infallible doctrine and this will not change through the ages' "" she said. They understand that in Benedictine's small mostly closeted gay community. Like the young man once deeply religious who suffers in silence as people on campus casually throw around anti-gay slurs. He's thought many times of leaving but generous financial aid keeps him here. And after many years he's accepted his sexuality. He's seen the joy that people can get from Benedictine how some will move back to Atchison after graduation just to stay close. But not him. ""I don't think I'll come back to Atchison — not ever.""

Remodeling a spiritual home For decades the pews at St. Maria Goretti were filled with the families of plumbers engineers and professors from the University of Wisconsin just a couple miles up the road. The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America's most liberal cities. Like so many other parishes it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church's moral absolutes like the contraception ban became forgotten dogma. Change arrived in 2003 with a new bishop Robert C. Morlino an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn ""All Are Welcome."" His successor Bishop Donald J. Hying steers clear of public battles. But in many ways he quietly carries on Morlino's legacy warning about ""the tangled thinking of Modernism."" In 2021 Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson a one time top Morlino aide as pastor of the Madison church. Parishioners watched — some pleased some uneasily — as their spiritual home was remodeled. There was more incense more Latin more talk of sin and confession. Emerson's sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners. Protection is needed he said in a 2023 service from ""the spiritual corruption of worldly vices."" He has warned against critics — ""the atheists journalists politicians the fallen-away Catholics"" — he said were undermining the church. For some Emerson's changes were welcome. ""A lot of us were like 'Hey more confession! Sweet!"" said Rouleau who ran the parish young adult group. ""Better music!""

Kisah cinta mereka yang dikaruniai empat anak yaitu Pangeran Charles Puteri Anne Pangeran Andrew dan Pangeran Edward itu sebetulnya tak berjalan dengan mudah dan penuh lika-liku. Kisah cinta keduanya dimulai ketika mereka masih berusia amat muda.

Keduanya pertama kali bertemu pada tahun 1934 saat Elizabeth berusia 7 tahun dan Philip masih 13 tahun. Kala itu Elizabeth II menjadi pengiring pengantin dari bibinya Putri Marina dari Yunani dan Denmark saat menikah dengan Pangeran George Duke of Kent di Westminster Abbey. Sementara Philip hadir sebagai sepupu pertama pengantin wanita.

Lima tahun kemudian di tahun 1939 mereka kembali bertemu ketika Elizabeth saat itu adalah seorang putri berusia 13 tahun. Siapa sangka sejak pertemuannya itu sang putri langsung terpikat pada pandangan pertama dengan saudara jauhnya itu seperti dikutip dari CNN International Sabtu (10/4/2021).





Elizabeth terpanah dengan kegagahan Philip yang kala itu berusia 18 tahun dan menjadi kadet Angkatan Laut. Menurut pengasuh Putri Elizabeth sang putri terpukau dengan kemampuan Philip melompati net di lapangan tenis.

Seiring berjalannya waktu Elizabeth dan Philip bertemu lagi di acara kerajaan dan tetap menjaga hubungan baik. Rupanya Kala itu Philip juga sudah mulai merasakan benih-benih cinta pada sang putri.



Di sela Philip yang kala itu tergabung dalam Angkatan Laut Inggris harus terjun di medan perang saat Perang Dunia II mereka harus menjalin hubungan jarak jauh dan saling berkirim kabar lewat surat.



Dua sejoli yang tengah dimabuk kasmaran saat itu selalu berusaha untuk bertemu dan menghabiskan waktu bersama untuk kencan dan menonton pertunjukan konser.



Pada 1946 Philip pun akhirnya memberanikan diri untuk melamar Elizabeth. Meskipun sempat terhalang restu ayah Elizabeth Raja George VI yang menginginkan putrinya menikah dengan laki-laki asal Inggris sedangkan Philip berasal dari kerajaan Yunani. Namun pada akhirnya hati sang ayah Elizabeth pun luluh.



Meski demikian Raja George VI meminta agar Philip dan Elizabeth merahasiakan pertunangan mereka dan mengumumkannya pada publik saat Elizabeth sudah berusia 21 tahun.



Sempat 'backstreet' atau menjalin hubungan secara diam-diam Namun pada akhirnya kabar pertunangan mereka secara resmi diumumkan pada Juli 1947 dan kemudian resmi menikah pada 20 November 1947 di Westminster Abbey yang dihadiri dua ribu tamu.



Bukan tanpa pengorbanan Philip pun harus rela melepas gelar keturunan Yunani dan menjadi warga negara Inggris yang dinaturalisasi demi menjadi pendamping hidup sang putri.

Kemudian ia mengadopsi nama keluarga Mountbatten dari pihak ibunya dan diangkat menjadi Duke of Edinburgh. Tepat sebelum pernikahan Philip diangkat menjadi Duke of Edinburgh dan dianugerahi gelar sebagai Royal Highness.



Melalui suka duka bersama dan akhirnya menghembuskan nafas terakhir di usia 99 tahun di Kastin Windsor pada 9 April 2021 lalu Pangeran Philip begitu dikagumi karena menjadi seorang suami yang amat mendukung peran istrinya.

Sosok inilah yang membuat Ratu Elizabeth semakin jatuh cinta pada suami yang mendampinginya selama 7 dekade tanpa gelar raja tersebut.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvbXBhc2lhbmEuY29tL2Zlcnk1MDk3My82MDcxMjBjZjhlZGU0ODFiN2U0MWRkYzMvamF0dWgtY2ludGEtc2ViZWx1bS1iZXJ0ZW11LWl0dS1ueWF0YS1hZGFueWEtcGVyY2F5YWxhaNIBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvbXBhc2lhbmEuY29tL2FtcC9mZXJ5NTA5NzMvNjA3MTIwY2Y4ZWRlNDgxYjdlNDFkZGMzL2phdHVoLWNpbnRhLXNlYmVsdW0tYmVydGVtdS1pdHUtbnlhdGEtYWRhbnlhLXBlcmNheWFsYWg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jatuh Cinta Sebelum Bertemu Itu Nyata Adanya Percayalah! - Kompasiana.com,"I knew I loved you before I met you

I think I dreamed you into life

I knew I loved you before I met you

I have been waiting all my life

Potongan Refrain dari lagu yang dinyanyikan oleh grup band asal Australia Savage Garden berjudul ""I Knew I Loved You"" ini menggambarkan bahwa cinta itu terkadang bisa menjadi aneh.



Bagaimana mungkin seseorang jatuh cinta tanpa pernah benar-benar bertemu. Tapi fakta itu memang ada dan benar-benar terjadi.

Meskipun saat lagu ini dirilis tahun 1999 fenomena jatuh cinta sebelum bertemu ini masih menjadi anomali.

Kenapa saya sebut anomali lantaran media yang memungkinkan hal itu terjadi masih sangat terbatas.

Bayangkan hanya lewat obrolan melalui telepon atau surat seseorang bisa jatuh cinta pada calon pasangannya walaupun tentu saja obrolan tersebut dilakukan secara intens.

Berbeda dengan saat ini fenomena jatuh cinta sebelum benar-benar bertemu kini sudah tak bisa dianggap anomali lagi.

Dunia digital dan pandemi memang nyata mengubah kebiasan hidup manusia nyaris secara holistik bahkan untuk urusan cinta.

Menurut sebuah survey yang dilakukan oleh situs kencan daring asal Inggris Bumble Dating seperti dilansir CNNIndonesia.

Sekitar 67 persen orang sekarang percaya bahwa sangat mungkin mereka jatuh cinta kepada seseorang sebelum merek benar-benar bertemu di dunia nyata.

Mereka pun sangat yakin bahwa mereka merasa telah menemukan cinta sejatinya hanya berdasarkan obrolan dan video.

The new generation offers perhaps the largest generational upgrade in technology since 2012 and the Intel Xeon E5-2600 V1 series.

Cisco UCS C220 M6 UCS C240 M6 and UCS B200 M6 Servers

Cisco has three models it is upgrading with Ice Lake Xeon. First we are going to cover the UCS B200 M6 then the C240 M6 and finally the C220 M6. This order was decided by the cover image we made above which is the opposite of the AMD EPYC 7003 Cisco UCS launch cover.

Cisco UCS B200 M6

The blade offering is the Cisco UCS B200 M6. This is a dual-socket node that can support 40 core Xeon CPUs which is impressive from a cooling perspective.

Here are the key specs:

1-2 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable Processors (with up to 40 cores per socket)

32 DIMM slots (16 DIMMs per CPU socket) 3200 MHz DDR4 or 16x DDR4 + 16x Optane PMem 200

Cisco UCS Virtual Interface Card (VIC) 1440 modular LAN on Motherboard (mLOM)

One rear slot for VIC (Cisco UCS VIC 1480 or port expander)

One front dedicated slot for a Cisco FlexStorage RAID controller Cisco FlexStorage passthrough or Cisco M.2 RAID controller

Up to two SAS/SATA/NVMe disk drives or up to four M.2 drives

Overall this is a fairly standard blade offering for Cisco but it has the impact of increasing core counts and memory significantly.

Cisco UCS C240 M6

The Cisco USC C240 M6 is the company’s 2U offering. As such it has a much higher degree of expansion capabilities.

Key specs include:

1-2 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable Processors (with up to 40 cores per socket)

32 DIMM slots (16 DIMMs per CPU socket) 3200 MHz DDR4 or 16x DDR4 + 16x Optane PMem 200

Up to eight PCIe Gen4 slots plus modular LAN on Motherboard (mLOM) slot and support for up to five GPUs

Support for Cisco UCS VIC 1400 Series adapters as well as third-party options

Up to 28 SAS/SATA/NVMe disk drives

RAID and M.2 boot options available

Overall this is a fairly standard 2U offering in the industry.

Cisco UCS C220 M6

For higher density applications than the C240 M6 2U system offers Cisco has its 1U offering.

Here are the key specs of the Cisco UCS C220 M6:

1-2 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable Processors (with up to 40 cores per socket)

32 DIMM slots (16 DIMMs per CPU socket) 3200 MHz DDR4 or 16x DDR4 + 16x Optane PMem 200

Up to three PCIe Gen4 slots plus modular LAN on Motherboard (mLOM) slot and support for up to two GPUs

Support for Cisco UCS VIC 1400 Series adapters as well as third-party options

Up to 10 SAS/SATA/NVMe disk drives

RAID and M.2 boot options available

Here one can see that the impact of moving to the 1U form factor is that we lose support for five PCIe slots and three GPUs we also can only get up to 10x 2.5″ drives instead of up to 28x on the 2U offering.

Final Words

Cisco has fewer server offerings than many of its competitors. Dell EMC for example has blade servers but also a wide range of rack servers. Supermicro has over 100 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable designs. Still it is good to see that Cisco is updating UCS and it now has a relatively close parity between its Intel Ice Lake and AMD EPYC 7003 “Milan” designs in the Cisco UCS M6 series.

The Mumbai-born tech tycoon reportedly one of the first three investors in Zoom saw the value of his multimillion-dollar stake more than quintuple over the past year with the video conferencing company’s market cap at one point topping an eyeball-shredding $130 billion.

Iyar 63 has now reinvested some of those ballooned winnings into luxury real estate. Records reveal he’s tossed down a total of $14.5 million for two separate mansions on L.A.’s scenic Palos Verdes Peninsula. The two houses one a $7.8 million Tuscan-style villa and the other a $6.7 million slightly smaller Tuscan-style villa are not contiguous but happen to sit on the very same blufftop street about five houses apart from one another. Both properties are blessed with unobstructed views of the Pacific Ocean and Catalina Island.

While it’s not yet clear why Iyar long based in California’s Silicon Valley suddenly wants or needs two lavish homes in the L.A. area it’s a logical guess that the properties may have acquired for his two adult daughters Leena and Nikhita both of whom appeared in Netflix’s “The Big Day” wedding docuseries. The sisters — both recently married to twin brothers — both celebrated their nuptials with million-dollar gala-style events and all the glitzy extravagance was photographed for Vogue India.

Iyar himself can easily afford a seven-figure wedding bill or two thanks to his storied career in tech. In the 1980s he worked for Apple before jumping to Intel in ’89. In 1996 he cofounded web conferencing firm WebEx which was sold to Cisco in 2007 for $3.2 billion in cash. Several years later Iyar founded Moxtra another digital conferencing solutions provider though he remains best-known for his involvement with Zoom where he serves as a strategic advisor.

TempleLive a division of Beaty Capital Group previously confirmed it is under contract to buy the Gold Dome 1112 NW 23 from current owner Johnathan Russell.

The economic forecast which TempleLive bases on restaurant retail and hotel and other anticipated spending by patrons comes with anticipation of the city being asked to assist in the costs that will include repairs to the building’s gold-colored geodesic dome.

What will OKC's new Gold Dome look like?

Conceptual designs show how the second floor of the Gold Dome lined with offices overlooking the first floor would be converted into box seats and a lower balcony looking out to a performance stage. Plans also suggest a two-story outdoor deck could be added to the north side facing NW 23.

Mike Brown president of TempleLive said the Gold Dome fits into its strategy of turning historic buildings into unique concert venues. The company to date has renovated former Masonic Temples in Fort Smith Arkansas Wichita Kansas and Cleveland Ohio.

Gold Dome:Operator hopes to convert iconic structure into concert venue: 'There is a process'

Brown said the Gold Dome is one of several historic buildings being looked at by his company that are not former Masonic Temples.

“As a lifetime Oklahoman living in Tulsa I have been keenly aware of this Oklahoma City Route 66 iconic and historic attraction” Brown said. “How cool will it be to restore this? The Oklahoma City Gold Dome has been patiently waiting to shine again with all things old being popular again.”

History of OKC's Gold Dome

The Gold Dome has languished for the past dozen years and twice has been threatened with demolition only to be saved by preservationists' protests.

When the Gold Dome was built in 1958 the two-story building with the familiar round anodized aluminum roof was touted by Citizens Bank as “the bank of tomorrow.”

By the late 1990s however the property had seen a series of bank tenants either fail or be acquired by larger bank chains. It was then targeted for demolition by its prior owner Bank One which was planning to sell the corner to Walgreens.

Bank One and Walgreens chose to build new locations east and west of the property and to let the Gold Dome stand after months of protests by preservationists and a sale of the building to optometrist Irene Lam. She proceeded on some renovations and leased space to a restaurant her own office and shop and the Oklahoma Main Street organization.

It then was foreclosed on by Lam's lender and sold to David Box in receivership who then sold it to current owner Johnathan Russell.

“Since we purchased the Gold Dome in 2015 the goal has been to preserve the building find a use that allows the public access and adds to the economic and cultural fabric of the community” Russell said. “TempleLive is the perfect occupant to accomplish all of those goals.”

Zack Wheeler unleashed 99-mph blurs to the Atlanta Braves hitters April 3 at Citizens Bank Park. He slung downward-sloping sliders that spun like Frisbees across the strike zone. He struck out Freddie Freeman on a slider up and away and Marcell Ozuna on a fastball at the knees.

If Dave Eiland didn’t know better he would have guessed he was watching Jacob deGrom.

“Listen” Eiland the former New York Mets pitching coach said by phone a few days later “I’m not going to sit here and say anybody pitch for pitch is right there with Jake deGrom. That’s not fair. I’m not making the statement that Zack Wheeler’s just as good as Jake deGrom.

“What I am saying is Zack’s starting to wander around that same neighborhood.”

Just as the Phillies wagered 16 months ago when they signed Wheeler to a five-year $118 million contract the third-largest free-agent deal in franchise history.

It wasn’t a sure thing. Wheeler had neither thrown 200 innings in a season nor made an All-Star team in his major-league career. But he was a former first-round pick who was still in the minors when he got traded straight-up for Carlos Beltran. He was also 29 four years removed from Tommy John elbow surgery and had a 3.65 ERA in 60 starts for New York in 2018-19.

If Wheeler was a stock it was a good time to buy even if the price was high.

So far Wheeler is paying off like shares of Zoom last year. Since the beginning of last season he has a 2.83 ERA in 82⅔ innings. He has overpowered hitters with a fastball that has averaged 97.2 mph so far this season or gotten outs early in the count. His ground-ball rate (54.6%) and rate of soft contact (20.9%) put him among the top five starting pitchers the last two years.

“He’s better than I ever gave him credit for” said a scout from a National League team. “I thought he was a pretty-delivery guy. He always had big stuff. But I didn’t think he had the moxie he’s showing now. He’s matured a lot the last two years. He’s out there under total control really challenging hitters. The bell has rung for him.”

It’s almost impossible to believe the Mets demoted Wheeler to triple A three years ago.

Fixing the mechanics

Wheeler’s ascension to the ranks of an elite major-league starter grew out of that disappointment.

Eiland took over as the Mets’ pitching coach after the 2017 season. In spring training of 2018 he tried to make changes to Wheeler’s delivery specifically shortening his arm stroke to help him find a more consistent release point. The changes didn’t take root immediately.

“Him and I had to sit down by ourselves and have some slightly uncomfortable conversations” Eiland said recalling the Mets’ decision to not put Wheeler on the opening-day roster. “A lot of the things I said to him he didn’t like to hear. But he needed to hear it.”

Wheeler made only one triple-A start before being recalled. Through five starts he had a 5.79 ERA. With all the focus on his mechanics his fastball was averaging only 94.4 mph an indication to Eiland that Wheeler lacked the confidence to repeat his delivery and throw his heater where he wanted it.

“He wasn’t letting it eat so to speak” Eiland said. “I remember calling him in one time and saying ‘Zack you have 95 96 97 sometimes 98 in the tank. Why are you throwing 92 93?’”

As Eiland recalls everything came out in a between-starts bullpen session in Cincinnati in early May.

“We talked about it and I said ‘The delivery is there. Your muscle memory is there. You’re repeating. Now let it go. Pitch in more. [If] you knock guys down you knock ‘em down. [If] you hit ‘em you hit ‘em. But let it fly’” Eiland said. “All of a sudden those 91 92 93s turned into 96 97 a couple 98s. He was pitching in to lefties; he was elevating. It was like OK here he goes. And off he went.”

It wasn’t that simple of course. Wheeler’s slider improved too. He began throwing his changeup with a splitter grip. He learned when to elevate his four-seam fastball. Mostly he figured out what type of pitcher he is realizing he had several ways to get hitters out.

But beginning with that start in Cincinnati on May 9 2018 when he allowed one run in six innings Wheeler turned a corner. He posted a 2.86 ERA in 24 starts over the rest of the season. As Eiland said “He was as good as deGrom maybe better. And deGrom won the Cy Young that year.”

Wheeler faltered in the first half of 2019 but regained his groove in the second half. Only seven pitchers have a lower ERA than Wheeler’s 2.83 mark in at least 150 innings since the 2019 All-Star break: deGrom (1.74) Gerrit Cole (2.17) Jack Flaherty (2.26) Shane Bieber (2.42) Yu Darvish (2.46) Clayton Kershaw (2.65) and Hyun Jin Ryu (2.82). His streak of 29 consecutive starts of at least five innings ended last Friday night in Atlanta when he struggled with his fastball command. Even then though he left with only a 3-1 deficit with two out in the fourth.

“I feel like every year’s gotten a little bit better a little bit more comfortable” Wheeler said in spring training. “Coming in every year you expect to do well and this year I’m building off of two good years in a row.”

Opposing hitters notice a difference too. Before 2018 Wheeler’s fastball was “noncompetitive” according to Freeman because his command was inconsistent. Moreover he hadn’t mastered the slider enough that hitters needed to respect it as a potential strike.

“He’s a lot more mature as a pitcher than he was a couple years ago” said Freeman the Braves’ All-Star first baseman. “He would throw a lot of pitches that you could easily just say ‘That’s a ball’ out of his hand. If every pitch is a pitch where you have to think about taking it’s a whole new ballgame. That’s what he’s learned to do. It’s like deGrom. Every time you take a pitch he makes you want to swing at it.”

There’s that comparison again.

Measuring up to the best

Wheeler and deGrom have similar repertoires — upper-90s fastballs sliders and changeups. DeGrom’s command may be slightly better though as Eiland said not by much.

As teammates in a Mets rotation that was supposed to stay together for years Wheeler measured himself against deGrom. Eiland labeled it a “friendly competition” each trying to one-up the other.

It’s doubtful that has changed now that they play for rival teams.

“Whenever deGrom would go out there and throw seven or eight shutout innings with 12 Ks you try to go up there and beat him” said Wheeler scheduled to face the Mets on Wednesday night in New York. “It was just a good competition. I think it helped us out.”

The Mets let Eiland go midway through the 2019 season before allowing Wheeler to walk at the end of the year. Free agents usually get paid based on past performance. In Wheeler the Phillies saw the rare free agent whose best days were still ahead.

Unsurprisingly Eiland agreed with that assessment.

“The first half of ’18 when I got [to the Mets] all I heard from some people in the front office was ‘We need to trade Wheeler’” Eiland said. “I’m like ‘No you don’t He’s going to be better than what you’re seeing now.’ He hit free agency at the perfect time for him. He was starting to come into his own.”

After the merger the younger Dozie went ahead to launch his Digital Bank Sparkle and has since then released several products and services effectively silencing his detractors.

Early years

Uzoma Dozie is the first of the five sons of Pascal Dozie (PGD). He was born in England in 1969 at the time when his father was working with Greater London Development Council as a young graduate. The family soon relocated to Uganda when Pascal Dozie was contracted by the Ugandan Government as a Statistician to work with a team carrying out an economic study in conjunction with the African Development Society Group.

In 1971 Idi Amin overthrew the elected government of Milton Obote and crisis broke out in Uganda. The family had no option but to return to Nigeria where the country was just trying to pick life again after the war. The family settled in Yaba area of Lagos and Uzoma started schooling.

His secondary education took him across three schools the Lebanese Community School (LCS) Yaba; Government College Owerri and Command Secondary School Kaduna.

Uzoma remembers that he did not always have things figured out and as a child had conflicting career interests. He was first interested in photography and for a while it seemed like he would pursue this passion but he changed his mind when he became a teenager and picked interest in becoming a doctor – a heart surgeon.

“In Nigeria then you were either a doctor or an engineer. It was when we went for an open day at the University of Sheffield where I was told that I had to spend seven years to become a doctor that I decided to change my intended course of study.

“I later went to the University of Reading where I studied chemistry. After that I went to the University College London to obtain a master’s degree in organic chemistry. We worked really hard to develop products that would help fight a number of diseases” he recounted in an interview.

While his studies helped him understand analytical processes it only left him more confused about what he was to do professionally. He was quite certain he did not want to become a chemist but went ahead to work as a sales representative for a pharmaceutical company in the UK for a couple of months before relocating to Nigeria.

Career moves

Back in Nigeria Pascal Dozie had founded Diamond Bank and was doubling as Managing Director and Board Chairman when Uzoma returned. With Pascal’s encouragement Uzoma decided to test the waters of the banking career and see if it would feel like home.

Uzoma got a job with Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank) on Broad Street while Fola Adeola was the Managing Director. He learnt a lot from working there and gradually banking was becoming a little more than ‘daddy’s suggestion’.

“My father wanted me to gain industry experience but he didn’t want me to start at Diamond Bank in order to avoid favouritism as the boss’ son and he didn’t want to protect me as well he needed me to find my own feet and fit. I spent a year at GTBank where I learnt a lot about developing a great work culture” he said.

Shortly after spending a year at GTBank the June 12 1993 election crisis and accompanying unrest rendered Uzoma jobless for about a year. Afterwards he joined Citizen International Bank (later known as Spring Bank) where he was placed on the oil and gas desk. This was a different experience more demanding and challenging. He had to travel a lot to oil-producing areas like Port Harcourt where he interacted with locals over their complaints.

Uzoma left Citizen bank after a while and proceeded to Imperial College in the UK for an MBA. Upon his return to Nigeria he joined Diamond Bank. He later became the Executive Director in charge of Lagos Businesses for a couple of years before he was appointed Deputy Managing Director in charge of Retail Banking. In November 2014 he was unanimously appointed by the Board as Group Managing Director / Chief Executive Officer.

One significant take-home Uzoma got from heading the Retail Banking Directorate was the significant gap in the market for a new approach to services for retailers and this later became the basis for Sparkle. He also observed the kind of growth Diamond bank experienced when it partnered with and built new services and new channels with fintech solutions and says that traditional banking system constricted growth because of the limitations to human resources.

He recalled that it took Diamond Bank 20 years with 400 branches to acquire five million customers but the mobile platform tripled the figure in 3 years a sign that it was time to go digital.

The Access-Diamond merger and accompanying rumours

Long before the official announcement of the merger deal between Diamond Bank and Access Bank the grapevine had several versions of the story. Some of these versions portrayed the merger as a failure of Diamond Bank and blamed Uzoma for destroying a bank his father started.

“We just focused on making our customers staff and shareholders happy. The Diamond-Access merger was smooth. Herbert Wigwe and I did roadshows to answer as many questions as possible. The Diamond Bank investors were happy about the deal they got. The deal was a sweet deal for our investors; they moved from a tier II bank to a tier I bank. There was pretty much nothing to explain to anyone” he said.

However what these rumours meant was that Uzoma Dozie was going to have to prove himself with his start-up – Sparkle and so far he appears to be doing fine.

Diamond sparkles

“Keep Sparkling” was the tagline that PGD held on to at Diamond Bank insisting that all of his staffs were ‘Diamonds’ and must stand out always. This tagline later influenced Uzoma Dozie’s choice of name for his digital bank – Sparkle.

The goal was to use Sparkle to help retailers achieve their daily objectives and scale their businesses providing a suite of innovative lifestyle services. Other services included in the innovation include customer experience-led support services ranging from inventory management and invoicing statements to foreign exchange services.

Powered by AI and Machine Learning Sparkle was also built to create a dynamic community around Nigeria’s retailers and consumers influencing purchasing decisions based on user-generated behavioural purchase data.

Sparkle partnered Visa Network International as well as PricewaterhouseCoopers and Microsoft to create the platform to enhance convenience & service and allow outside developers to contribute and build solutions. Sparkle also has a customer service chatbot called Indy which provides users with real-time information.

Uzoma secured a banking license from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to offer financial services and so Sparkle allowed users to make purchases online and in-person with both Sparkle physical and virtual cards. Where necessary users can also pay bills and split payments using SparklePay which lets users send money to people without knowing their account numbers.

About this innovation Uzoma Dozie said “Retailers and consumers in Nigeria are currently disconnected; Sparkle is building the solution around its understanding of the challenges of small businesses which will help reduce the operational risks small businesses are exposed to in their infancy. Sparkle is a product a community born out of necessity for Nigeria’s retail landscape. We will connect millions of retailers on a digital platform providing a service they can trust that is seamless and that allows for frictionless transactions across all activities and business services.”

The startup recently launched a new service called Sparkle Business to provide access to various products and services for small businesses and SMEs in the region including services like Tax Advisory/Calculations and Payroll/Employee Management.

There are no mentions of an IPO or external funding for the Digital bank anytime soon.

Other interests

Dozie sits on the Board of Women’s World Banking; and has spoken at several events around the world on the issue of technology and financial inclusion.

Even as a banker he had developed an interest in the tech space and launched TechFest in 2018 to bring together leading dignitaries of Nigeria’s technology and business sectors. He showcases tech start-up CEOs and founders in Tech Turks his online TV show where he discusses opportunities and challenges in the tech industry.

Uzoma Dozie has also founded an angel fund called Black Knight through which he has invested in a number of Nigerian technology start-ups. According to Uzoma Black Knights is taking a long-term approach to investing in Nigerian enterprises by providing them with access to funding access to market access to business advice and mentorship and creating a community of entrepreneurs.

Family influence

As the son of PGD the busy economic consultant and later on Founder Uzoma recalled that he did not see much of his father but when PGD was around he would tell them stories.

“We learnt a lot about decision making speed and risk from our parents. I remember how my father took an early bet on MTN Nigeria and I don’t need to tell you how successful it is now” Uzoma said.

He also noted that his mother’s advice on being transparent is one he has adopted in several trying situations as a Chief Executive. “My mother taught us to be open; if you fail don’t hide it. She would tell everyone ‘Look at my son he failed in school’ and that would kill all the rumours. Transparency removes uncertainty so you own the story.”"

CME Group nearby oat futures are record high. Food-grade oat flake prices as reported by Sosland Publishing Co. in mid-October were up 62% from a year ago.

While many industries are experiencing COVID-19 related shortages the dire oat situation mainly is a factor of basic supply-and-demand. Major oat growing areas in the United States and Canada were impacted by drought during the 2021 growing season. At the same time demand for oats has been climbing due to its long-recognized health benefits popularity in snack products and most recently — oat “milk.” And the strong demand season for oats as a hot breakfast cereal — oatmeal — is about to arrive.

“Demand for oats and processed oats products has seen good growth over the years but in the last year that has escalated with demand for oat-based dairy alternatives” said Steve Eilertson president and chairman of Grain Millers Inc. which has plants in the United States and Canada.

Oat milk sales have risen about 70-fold since 2017 account for 16% of non-dairy milk sales (more than soy rice and coconut milk combined) and are second only to almond milk Bloomberg noted in a recent article. New oat milk plants are being built adding to demand for the scarce commodity.

“The oat has a humble history as a staid breakfast choice in the form of oatmeal or cereal” Bloomberg said. “But more recently it’s become a trendy darling of millennials. Food companies targeting younger more affluent consumers are billing it as an accessible superfood.”

US 2021 oat production was estimated by the US Department of Agriculture at 39.836 million bushels down 39% from 2020 and the lowest in records back to 1866. Oats outturn in the four largest-producing states (Minnesota North and South Dakota and Wisconsin) was down an aggregate 58%.

“We came into the year with low stocks” Eilertson said. “We needed a good growing season to build stocks back. And we know what happened: production approaching half of what was needed. Much of this deterioration happened late in the growing season and really caught a lot of people by surprise.”

US oats primarily is used as a feed ingredient with US millers highly dependent on imports from Canada where 2021 production was estimated down 44% from 2020 and an 11-year low. Canada typically is the world’s largest oats exporter.

“Total (US) oat supplies for 2021-22 are projected to be 147 million bushels compared with the 2020-21 estimate of 188 million bushels (down 22%)” the USDA said. “This amount is the lowest total supply on record.”

Further US oats imports in 2021-22 are forecast at 69 million bushels down 19% from 2020-21 due to the small Canadian crop. Domestic food seed and residual use is forecast at 80 million bushels up 2.6% from 2020-21 resulting in oats carryover on June 1 2022 in the United States at 25 million bushels also record low.

CME Group nearby oats futures closed at a record-high $6.62 per bushel on Oct. 18 up about 125% from a year earlier when values were below $3 per bushel. Oat futures typically follow corn futures since corn is the most widely grown feed grain. Oat futures prices have topped corn futures briefly only a couple times in the past decade until this fall when oats futures have at times been more than $1 a bushel or about 20% above corn.

Food-grade oat flake prices were quoted by Sosland Publishing Co. at about $45 per cwt in mid-October also record high.

“We would run out of oats at $3.50 a bushel but we won’t run out at $10 – that’s where we’re headed” Eilertson said.

Spot oats prices already were $8 a bushel f.o.b. in the United States and $10 in Canada he said with oat flakes headed to $50 a cwt.

“I would expect the price would ultimately ration demand” he said.

Also Eilertson said users earlier contracted 60% to 80% of their needs for 2021-22 at much lower prices so the current record-high prices apply to the last 20% to 40% of needs but a shortage of just 10% is enough to “blow up” the market.

“The drought in the United States of 1988 is the last time the market was severely short oats and was able to source a significant amount of oats from northern Europe” Eilertson said. “The EU oat market should have some oats to export to North America. Will it be enough to help us get to new crop? That is the question.”

Production of oats in the United States has declined for decades as demand for the grain as horse feed has declined and as other crops were much more profitable. Whether growers will respond to high oat prices by planting more oats in 2022 depends on where oat prices are closer to planting early next spring and on prices of competing crops which have been elevated as well especially in the Upper Midwest and Canadian Prairie oats growing areas.

“Plant oats; get rewarded” Eilertson said. “For oat-based ingredient buyers it will be a year that will come with challenges but know there will be a light at the end of the tunnel – a new harvest.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

NEW DELHI: UK's Cairn Energy Plc has offered to forego USD 500 million and invest that amount in any oil and gas or renewable energy project identified by the Indian government if New Delhi agrees to honour an international arbitration award and returns the value of loss it incurred because of being taxed retrospectively sources said.The Scottish firm invested in the oil and gas sector in India in 1994 and a decade later it made a huge oil discovery in Rajasthan. In 2006-07 it listed its Indian assets on the BSE. Five years after that the government passed a retroactive tax law and billed Cairn Rs 10247 crore plus interest and penalty for the reorganisation tied to the flotation.The state then expropriated and liquidated Cairn's remaining shares in the Indian entity seized dividends and withheld tax refunds to recover a part of the demand.Cairn challenged the move before an arbitration tribunal in The Hague which in December awarded it USD 1.2 billion (over Rs 8800 crore) plus costs and interest which totals USD 1.725 million (Rs 12600 crore) as of December 2020.The company has in talks with finance ministry officials offered to forego the interest and cost totalling over USD 500 million and invest that sum in any oil and gas or renewable energy project identified by Indian government if the principal of USD 1.2 billion due to it is paid three sources with knowledge of the matter said.The Indian government which appointed one of the three arbitrators on The Hague panel and fully participated in the arbitration proceedings since 2015 wanted Cairn to settle the issue through its now-closed tax dispute resolution scheme Vivad se Vishwas Vivad se Vishwas scheme which closed on March 31 provided for dropping of tax case if 50% of the demand was paid which the company rejected they said.Even if it were to have agreed to the scheme the Indian government had to refund about Rs 2500 crore to the British firm they said adding the value of shares seized and sold dividend confiscated and tax refund withheld totaled to over Rs 7600 crore which was more than 50 per cent of the Rs 10247 crore principal tax demand raised.""The company has a tribunal ruling which says India breached its obligations to Cairn under the UK-India Bilateral Investment Treaty and that compensation in form of return of the value of shares seized and sold tax refund withheld and dividend confiscated was due. Instead you are asking it to pay half of the tax amount raised levying short-term capital gains tax is something that the company's marquee shareholders will never agree to"" one of them said.While Cairn declined to comment on the story finance ministry officials could not be immediately reached for comments.Cairn executives have since held three face-to-face meetings and at least one video call with top finance ministry officials to get them to honour the award.Both sides are eager to resolve the issue quickly without resorting to any harsh measures sources said.The Indian govt has appealed against the tribunal ruling on grounds that tax levied by a sovereign power should not be subject to private arbitration.In the meantime therefore Cairn which is of the opinion that the unanimous ruling of the tribunal was enforceable against Indian-owned assets in more than 160 countries that have signed and ratified the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards has hired asset-tracing firms to investigate the overseas assets that could be seized to recover the amount due.Cairn has already taken steps to have the arbitration award recognised in nine major jurisdictions such as the US UK France the Netherlands Singapore and Canada's Quebec province where Indian sovereign assets have been identified.It hasn't said what it might go after but assets could include Air India 's planes vessels belonging to the Shipping Corporation of India and property owned by state banks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvdmlqYXlhd2FkYS9nb3Z0LXBsYW5zLXBocy1wbGFudHMtdG8tc3VwcG9ydC1yZW5ld2FibGVzL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgxOTk0MzI1LmNtc9IBfGh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvdmlqYXlhd2FkYS9nb3Z0LXBsYW5zLXBocy1wbGFudHMtdG8tc3VwcG9ydC1yZW5ld2FibGVzL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MTk5NDMyNS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Andhra Pradesh govt plans PHS plants to support renewables,AMARAVATI: In what is described to be a gamechanger in stabilizing the power grid  the state government has set its focus on Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) plants.Since supplies from solar and wind power plants are unpredictable and not completely reliable it would result in fluctuations in the grid’s stability.In order to overcome these disadvantages the grid needs a reliable fall back arrangement to compensate for variability of wind and solar power and to store excess or unusable energy from renewable sources and therefore allow for better integration of these types of renewable energy into the grid.This is where PHS comes into the picture. In view of the expected growth in the share of renewable energy the state government is setting up PHSs to bring balance to the grid.The state government has decided to promote Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) power projects at all feasible locations both on river and off-river to generate power to balance the variable renewable energy power and to meet the peak energy demand.Energy minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy said that the state government has decided to promote renewable energy projects on multiple grounds--meeting growing energy demand attracting investments providing 24x7 power supply and maintaining grid balance. He said that RE power projects would help increase tax revenue by attracting huge private investment.In the normal course the PHS work as conventional hydro power stations but when they are not producing power they are used as pumping stations that pump water from low level reservoir to the high level reservoir.PHS is hydel power which is free from the effects of environmental hazards thus curbing air and water pollution easily adaptable to automation remotely controllable and allows flexibility in operation schedules said energy secretary Dr Nagulapalli Srikanth.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibmEuYmgvZW4vQXJhbWNvaW5rczEyLjRiaWxsaW9uaW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmVpbnZlc3RtZW50ZGVhbC5hc3B4P2Ntcz1xOEZtRkpnaXNjTDJmd0l6T04xJTJCRGhDc0YlMkJUWjdwcU1Gb2xjNVRNVmZrUSUzRNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aramco inks $12.4 billion infrastructure investment deal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bna.bh/en/Aramcoinks12.4billioninfrastructureinvestmentdeal.aspx?cms=q8FmFJgiscL2fwIzON1%2BDhCsF%2BTZ7pqMFolc5TMVfkQ%3D on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibmEuYmgvZW4vQXJhbWNvaW5rczEyLjRiaWxsaW9uaW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmVpbnZlc3RtZW50ZGVhbC5hc3B4P2Ntcz1xOEZtRkpnaXNjTDJmd0l6T04xJTJCRGhDc0YlMkJUWjdwcU1Gb2xjNVRNVmZrUSUzRNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

Pakistan’s generosity combined with the Ramazan spirit creates a fantastic time to carry forth the mission to make ‘giving and sharing’ an everyday practice under the slogan – “Ao ehad karain: Mil kar bhook Mitayain.”,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnZlbmllbmNlc3RvcmUuY28udWsvcHJvZHVjdHMvbmV3LWRlc2lnbi1mb3ItY29jYS1jb2xhLXJhbmdlLzY1NDk5OS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New design for Coca-Cola range | Product News,"The Coca-Cola Company has announced a new design for the Coca-Cola trademark to bring Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke together.

The new look is part of an evolution of the ‘One Brand’ Strategy that launched worldwide in 2016. The new design aims to be simplified removing added elements such as the red disc to elevate the iconic trademarks with global consistency. The new design also raises the Coca-Cola logo to the top of the label.

The aim of the change is to provide a “simple and intuitive navigation system that carries across all Coca-Cola variants while simultaneously celebrating the Coca-Cola logo.” The updated design will be led by Coca-Cola Zero Sugar which has also debuted a changed recipe that brings it closer to that of Coca-Cola Original Taste.

A new marketing campaign will support the new recipe for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. The campaign “Best Coke Ever?” will feature across TV and digital films out-of-home and will work with influencers and consumers alike to join the debate in social media.

The new recipe design and campaign for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar has already launched in Europe and Latin America. The rest of the trademark design will roll out globally throughout 2021 with flavours to be fully converted over in 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vY291bnR5MTAuY29tL2N3Yy1zdHVkZW50LXJlY2VpdmVzLXByZXN0aWdpb3VzLXNjaG9sYXJzaGlwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CWC student receives prestigious scholarship,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://county10.com/cwc-student-receives-prestigious-scholarship/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vY291bnR5MTAuY29tL2N3Yy1zdHVkZW50LXJlY2VpdmVzLXByZXN0aWdpb3VzLXNjaG9sYXJzaGlwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjEvMDQvMTAvZ2VvcmdpYS1uZXctdm90aW5nLWxhdy1leHBsYWluZWQvNzEzMzU4NzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Georgia voting law: Here's what to know about the new election rules,"State lawmakers in Georgia overhauled its existing election protocol last month with the passage of a law that includes restrictions some activists say haven't been seen since the Jim Crow era.

Democrats and civil-rights groups panned the voting bill and major Georgia-based corporations came out against the bill after it was passed. GOP state lawmakers who backed the bill and other Republicans nationwide harshly criticized the backlash calling for boycotts of brands like Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines.

Supporters have also argued the changes will restore voters' confidence in the election process and make elections more secure. But civil-rights advocates say the restrictions are aimed at voter suppression particularly for Black voters.

The election reforms came after President Joe Biden defeated former President Donald Trump by a narrow 11779 votes in Georgia in last year's general election. Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff also won two Senate runoff elections in January which flipped control of the U.S. Senate.

Biden called the law ""un-American"" and described it as a ""blatant attack on the Constitution and good conscious.""

Trump also slammed the bill but he deemed the measure ""too weak.""

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and likeminded Republicans have defended the law since its passage with the governor insisting it expands access to voting.

What's actually in Georgia's new election law? Here's what you need to know about Senate Bill 202:

When does Georgia's election law go into effect?

Gov. Brian Kemp signed the bill on March 31. Certain provisions will go into effect on July 1:

Special ballots will be created for nonpartisan elections

Ballots must be printed in black and white ink on security paper

A cutoff date of 11 days before a primary general election or runoff election for mail-in ballot applications

A deadline for the issuance of absentee ballots at least 25 days before a federal primary general election or special election or 22 days before a municipal general election or primary

A Georgia state driver's license number ID card number date of birth and the last four digits of a social security number or another approved form of identification must be printed on the outside of an absentee ballot

Conditions for rejecting absentee ballots if certain requirements are not met

What about early voting?

The law expands in-person early voting for general elections according to The AJC. Two early-voting periods are required on a Saturday for each county with optional voting on Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (hours may be extended to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.).

In prior elections early voting began on the fourth Monday before a primary or election and ended the Friday before an election day according to the state's official website. For runoff elections voting began as soon as possible before election day.

Some leaders of Georgia's Black churches say the new schedule will affect voting after church services also known as ""souls to the polls.""

The voting period for runoff elections was also shortened from nine weeks to four weeks.

Refreshments for voters waiting in line

The law bans people aside from poll workers from soliciting votes or signatures from voters. The distribution or display of campaign materials is also restricted to 150 feet of the ""outer edge"" of a polling location or within 25 feet of a person waiting in line to vote. Offering money and gifts – including food or drink – to a voter is prohibited. In a rebuke of the proposal last month Georgia Senate Minority Leader Gloria Butler a Democrat said Republican lawmakers ""want to make it a crime to bring Grandma some water while she’s waiting in line.”

Voters have waited hours in long lines at polling places in recent elections especially in Black neighborhoods.

Poll officers are permitted to distribute materials encouraging voter participation as required by law. Officers may also make self-service water available to voters.

Training for poll watchers

Training provided by the political party political body or candidate designating the poll watcher is a prerequisite for qualifying for or being appointed a poll watcher. Those responsible for designating poll watchers must attest to their training under oath.

New rules for ballot drop boxes

A board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk may supply one drop box for absentee by mail voters at the respective offices or inside advanced voting locations. Additional drop boxes are restricted to one per 100000 active registered voters in a county or the number of advanced voting locations. The boxes are only accessible during advanced voting.

The number of drop boxes for Georgia's four most populous counties Fulton Cobb DeKalb and Gwinnett will drop from 94 in 2020 to 23 in 2022 according to The Times.

Deadlines for tabulating absentee ballots

Elections superintendents must report the returns of verified and accepted absentee ballots by 5 p.m. the day following an election day. In the event of a missed deadline the State Election Board may convene to conduct an independent review.

In prior elections absentee ballots were accepted until 7 p.m. on an election day. The law allowed a week to finalize and certify the final vote count according to the AJC.

What about mobile voting buses?

The mobile voting program was launched in Fulton County Georgia – where Atlanta is located – near the end of 2020 in part to service voters with disabilities according to the county's official website. The buses were also alternatives to long lines at polling locations.

The new law restricts buses and ""other readily movable"" facilities to emergency use only. County superintendents may provide portable polling facilities for a given precinct at their discretion.

New role for Georgia's secretary of state

Prior to the passing of the new law the secretary of state served as chair of the State Election Board. The role was demoted to an ex-officio nonvoting member of the board. A new chairperson will be elected by the General Assembly.

The move allows a Republican-controlled board to temporarily take over local election offices according to NPR. Some critics also suggest the provision is an act of revenge against Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger who would not abide by Trump's request to overturn the results of the presidential election according to The New York Times.

Yet I’m pretty certain the law is an attempt by GOP Gov. Brian Kemp to ingratiate himself with Trump voters who believe Kemp didn’t do enough to prevent the Peach State from turning blue in the last election.

I’m also totally convinced that Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred shouldn’t be within a mile of this sordid political mess.

I say this as someone who respects the MLB commish and likes him for his business acumen. For all the contretemps of the past year that hit the league amid COVID he managed to cut a deal with the players ­union. It was a mess but at least we had baseball during some dark times in 2020 and again this year.

That’s why it’s confounding that he thought he should transform himself overnight into some sort of social-activist warrior for the sake of the league by moving this year’s All-Star game out of Atlanta touching off a firestorm of criticism that some say may cost him his job.

No offense to Rob but few great pitchers make great hitters and there are few good businesspeople who can navigate the backstabbing world of politics.

As I write this Manfred is being vilified by fans for giving in to a left-wing mob costing majority-minority Atlanta jobs and being second-guessed by many MLB officials and owners for naively thrusting the game into one of the thorniest political issues of our time by taking a stand on Georgia’s controversial new law.

Still you can sympathize with his predicament. The president of the United States falsely suggested the Georgia law was racist because people might have to show ID to vote. Biden then idiotically urged MLB to play the All-Star game somewhere else.

Once that fuse was lit the usual group of corporate wokesters jumped into the fray: Delta Coca-Cola and of course Larry Fink the uber-progressive CEO of money-management powerhouse BlackRock that has seeded the Biden administration with its top executives.

Then it was game on for the activists who descended on the commissioner’s office in droves. Manfred spoke with various players about the issue and was worried about protests and boycotts people close to him tell me.

Ultimately Manfred feared that if the game remained in Truist Park in suburban Cobb County Ga. he would be a pawn of progressive activists. An All-Star game that was supposed to be a celebration of Atlanta Braves great Hank Aaron (who died in January) would be reshaped into a political event to bash the Georgia law and possibly push other progressive edicts such as legislation to nationalize voting regulations.

Given the mounting pressure Manfred believed the least political solution was to make a statement by taking a swipe at the Georgia law and then get out of town I am told.

The role of Stacey Abrams in this spectacle is note­worthy. Abrams who nearly became governor in 2018 is credited with turning Georgia blue for the presidential election and creating a get-out-the-vote platform that elected Dems to two bitterly contested Georgia US Senate seats that made Chuck Schumer majority leader.

An Abrams spokesman says she never met with Manfred directly nor did she support moving the game out of Atlanta since it would cost so many minority jobs. (An estimated $100 million in economic activity has now moved to the new site of the All-Star game the majority-majority city of Denver.)

However the spokesman Seth Bringman confirmed that Abrams let it be known to MLB officials that she wanted the league to support her voting-rights efforts including speaking out against the Georgia law.

“In a single one-on-one conversation with an MLB senior adviser she urged the league to keep the All-Star game in Georgia and to speak out against the law when they do” said Bringman.

A senior baseball executive has a less-benign take on Abrams’ part in the mess. In his telling she was part of a group of activists including NBA superstar LeBron James who “wanted us to do more than just a pre-game ceremony . . . Baseball would have to be in the market for doing stuff” involving voting rights.

One thing is certain: By mixing business with woke­ism Manfred has satisfied no one. Abrams hasn’t stopped touting that she wanted the All-Star game to remain in Atlanta even if only on her political terms.

Even worse many baseball fans (who trend conservative) want Manfred’s head. MLB officials are now worried about fan boycotts.

In the words of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McCon­nell: “Republicans drink ­Coca-Cola too and we fly and we like baseball. It’s ­irritating one hell of a lot of Republican fans.”

It’s a lesson our increasingly woke CEOs should heed or they may soon be in the same no-win predicament as Manfred."

The online sports broadcaster which in March snatched the rights to screen Italy's top soccer championship from Sky owned by Comcast for the next three seasons in the league's home market offers its users three out of 10 Serie A games per week under its current agreement with the Italian league.

Many users put the video sport app under fire on social media on Sunday complaining of a blackout for the whole of the two Serie A matches played in the day.

""We are very sorry about what happened with DAZN platform"" DAZN said in a statement posted on its Italian-language profile on Twitter adding the problem has been involving its services in several countries in Europe.

""We are investigating the failure stemming from a third party provider Comcast Technology Solutions (CTS) which affected DAZN and other broadcasters in Europe"" DAZN said in a separate statement later in the day adding the problem had been fixed.

DAZN said it would offer compensation to subscribers who have been affected from glitches during Sunday's matches.

CTS said that a technical malfunction caused temporary service interruptions in Europe for four of its CTS video customers.

""We were in close contact with them as we resolved the issue and apologise to all that were impacted"" it added in a statement.

Owned by billionaire Len Blavatnik's Access Industries DAZN dubbed the Netflix of Sports debuted in Germany and Japan in 2016 and in December announced the launch of its live and on-demand sports streaming service in 200 countries.

This week we will analyze the events of the past two weeks with a particular focus on T-Mobile’s Home Internet Uncarrier announcement last Thursday.

Before diving into the rest of the Brief congratulations to two companies who have been good friends over the last decade. Regional data center company DC Blox headed by Cbeyond veterans Jeff Uphues Mark Masi and Chris Gatch reported on March 29 that they had raised $187 million from Post Road Group and Bain Capital to continue their Southeast expansion. We will cover more on their progress in next week’s “Up and Comers” post. We like to think of DC Blox in the same manner as we thought about regional middle-mile fiber providers in the 2000s – making long-term investments with a commercial real estate/ telecom balance.

Also longtime friend and Kansas City-based entrepreneur Rob Oyler announced last Friday that WANRack would be purchased by the investment arm of real estate giant CBRE (press release here). Having known Rob and most of the WANrack team since they formed the company in 2012 (including many meetings at Broadway Coffee in Kansas City that year) it has been terrific seeing them grow and invest. WANRack now has over 68 school networks covering 23 states with many more in construction thanks to a strong 2020. Kudos to all involved.

The week that was

“POP!” is the best word to describe last week’s Fab Five market activity. Over the last two weeks their market capitalization has risen $757 billion and the cumulative market capitalization is just shy of $8.3 trillion. As we disclosed on Friday all of this gain happened the week of April 5 ($785 billion gain from 4/5-4/9 vs $28 billion loss from 3/29-4/2). As best we can tell this is the best single weekly performance ever for the Fab Five. Even Apple who for the 1st quarter of 2021 seemed content to hold on to 2020 gains is now in positive territory. What happened?

As our economy recovers from the COVID-induced recession those companies with healthy balance sheets will accelerate hiring product development marketing and capital investments to improve their competitiveness. The Fab Five had $607 billion in cash and marketable securities entering 2021 with a collective $218 billion in short and long-term debt (a figure that is within $30 billion of AT&T’s projected Q1 debt) . They refused to choke on cheap debt and made most if not all of their 2020 acquisitions in cash (it also didn’t hurt that they weren’t bidders in the C-Band auction). Google Amazon and Microsoft stand to gain from their growing cloud computing businesses while Google and Facebook should also benefit from an improved advertising outlook.

A good case in point is the HoloLens contract awarded to Microsoft by the Department of Defense (announcement here). According to Ars Technica The total value over the next ten years could approach $22 billion (which makes all the fighting over the $10 billion Jedi contract look small). Applying low latency augmented/ mixed reality and instant feedback to prepare for the net war would seem to be something Verizon perhaps in collaboration with Lockheed would trumpet. Did Microsoft just scoop a key 5G use case and steal someone’s thunder? As a matter of fact they did.

To recap Apple gained $198 billion in the last two weeks (the equivalent of 1.2 T-Mobiles in value in a fortnight) Google gained $169 billion Amazon gained $161 billion Microsoft gained $146 billion and Facebook $84 billion. They are on pace to exceed last year’s $2.5 trillion of incremental market cap gains. And if that weren’t enough Amazon fought off an intense effort to unionize their Bessemer Alabama facility (why it failed in a landslide is covered quite well in this New York Times article as well as this Wall Street Journal article).

Meanwhile the Telco Top Five continue to hold on to their 2020 gains. T-Mobile erased half of their 2021 losses (+$8 billion) while Comcast lost $8 billion (inexplicable in our view) and the rest largely marked time. One bright spot for AT&T was the release of Godzilla vs. Kong which has grossed $48 million in domestic box office sales (plus and additional $237 million globally) according to BoxOfficeMojo.com. While the latest blockbuster will not be reflected until 2Q 2021 earnings WarnerMedia’s “day and date” change appears to have been a wise move (in addition to the numbers above Deadline estimates that over 3.6 million households watched at least five minutes of Godzilla vs. Kong over the Easter holiday weekend making it the most watched debut in HBO Max’s short history).

As we have mentioned in other Briefs AT&T is going to increasingly use their content to transform their customer relationships and brand. As we emerge from the pandemic this summer it would not be surprising to see AT&T reinforce moviegoing traditions with some promotion (free or discounted tickets for all new AT&T/ HBO Max customers to selected titles would be innovative and profitable).

Network quality metrics also were updated over the last two weeks. T-Mobile trumpeted their latest results from global testing firm umlaut (results here) which found T-Mobile had the largest fastest and most accessible 5G network in 44 of 50 states (Alaska Arkansas Nebraska Rhode Island South Dakota and Vermont were split between Verizon and AT&T). While this is indicative of the significant progress T-Mobile has made since the merger closed a year ago our tracking of RootMetrics Metro RootScore reports (here) shows that they still have a ways to go.

As the nearby table shows RootMetrics has published the results of 55 out of 125 metro areas (measured every six months). Unlike other testing agencies RootMetrics uses the same device across all carriers (a Samsung S20+ or Note 20 5G device). The results continue a trend we have discussed in previous Briefs: AT&T is challenging Verizon’s long-held pole position at RootMetrics with over half of the markets categorized as a two or three-way tie. These include larger metro areas such as St. Louis (19th largest MSA in the USA) Denver (#20) San Antonio (#24) and Austin (#29). While T-Mobile has also improved they are not showing up in the winner column with the same frequency as AT&T. We expect to see outright T-Mobile wins beginning in 2H 2021 as they complete their upgraded network rollouts to more MSAs. For a good indication of T-Mobile’s progress check out the Philadelphia RootScore results released last week here. The City of Brotherly Love was one of T-Mobile’s first 5G markets and their progress shows with wins in Network Speed and Data Performance.

Is T-Mobile a credible home internet provider?

T-Mobile dominated the communications sector news flow over the past two weeks announcing:

The shutdown of TVision (March 29) An expansion of their relationship with Google including an aggressive YouTube TV promotion to all T-Mobile subscribers (March 29) A enterprise-focused partnership with Level(3)/ Lumen (April 6) Free Samsung Galaxy A32 5G phones to new and existing customers (April 7). Link for items d-f is here A compelling switching offer to AT&T and Verizon customers subscribing to legacy “bucket” rate plans The rollout of Home Internet service to 30 million homes (April 7)

We could fill many Briefs discussing these topics (especially the cozier relationship with Level(3)/ Lumen) but will focus this week on the Home internet proposition. Below we compare T-Mobile to the incumbent telco (CenturyLink/ Lumen Verizon DSL and AT&T) as well as the incumbent cable company (Comcast and Spectrum) for both stand-alone Internet as well as an Internet + TV double play. There’s a lot of information below and we are glad to share our analysis upon request.

To test the value of T-Mobile’s Home Internet service we randomly pulled three addresses from Greeley CO (80634) and Reading PA (19601) and used our former home address in Dallas TX (75244). The first location in Greeley is on the southwest side of town (zip code population = 66043 and grew 25% over the last decade. Average home value according to Zillow is ~$380000 and grew at 6.7% last year). Nearby is the serviceability result we received from CenturyLink.

This result is anything but great. A community growing population at 25% with an average home value at $380000 and mid-single digit growth deserves a corresponding bandwidth choice. 1.5 Mbps for $64/ mo is a dismal alternative.

Comcast had a much more compelling alternative with 200 Mbps downstream service available for $49.99/ mo. on a 12-month contract. But the XFi device is an additional $14.99/ mo. bringing the total cost to $64.99 for stand-alone Internet. And the renewal cost is $70/ mo. ($85/ mo. with modem).

Here’s the service map for the particular address in question (by LTE service band). You can see from this map that the address would receive excellent low-band service and good mid-band. (2.5 GHz may not have been deployed in Greeley yet). On T-Mobile’s 5G map coverage is listed as “fair” so it’s more likely that data would be provided through the LTE network.

T-Mobile’s service includes also the option to purchase YouTube TV for $54.99 (+ taxes). So the double play package would come in at $60 for Internet (modem taxes & fees included) and $54.99 for TV – roughly $115/ mo. plus the cost to pick up a Roku Apple TV or Amazon Fire TV if you don’t already own a smart TV (full compatibility here).

The $115/ mo. is slightly less expensive than Comcast’s new customer pricing once local broadcast fees and regional sports fees are baked in – their double play runs $80.00/mo. for the first year (+$14.99/ mo. cable modem + $14.99/ mo. to connect two TVs + $9 regional broadcast fees + $8 regional sports fee). So $12/ more for Comcast in the first year but $22/ mo. more after the new customer promotions have expired.

The bottom line for T-Mobile’s prospects for Greeley: Much better than Lumen and slightly better than Comcast (unless the family needs the extra 100 Mbps download speeds).

In a more populated area like Reading PA (city with 89000 population and a high percentage living below the poverty line) T-Mobile offers a very compelling alternative to Verizon (this is a non-FiOS area). Using a downtown residential location we were able to easily locate both excellent 5G and very strong LTE coverage. Verizon’s 1.1-3.0 Mbps service costs $40/ mo. but includes a free modem. No other services are offered. A nonstarter for sure.

Like we saw with Greeley Comcast is the provider for Reading and their offer is essentially the same but the added TV fees are slightly higher. The result is $13 more for a TV + Internet bundle versus YouTube TV + T-Mobile Home Internet in the first year of Comcast’s promotion and $23 more for the second year and beyond.

Finally we look at the Preston Hollow area of Dallas Texas (zip code 75224; 18% population growth over the last decade; average home value $524K with 7.4% growth in 2020). Like the Reading address coverage could not be better for T-Mobile Home Internet service.

This is not the case for AT&T Fiber. While AT&T covers much of the zip code with their latest technology (~72%) the specific address we checked (our former address) did not have AT&T Fiber offered. But they did offer an “up to” 75 Mbps service for $55/ mo. including modem cost. Again very disappointing results for a great neighborhood where homes recently sold for $850K and up to have subpar broadband options.

Fortunately Spectrum services this area with cable and their double play is attractive for the first two years of service (existing customers will be more likely to consider T-Mobile Home Internet as an alternative than new movers). Spectrum’s costs are shown nearby. Note the Broadcast TV surcharge of $16.45 per month. That masks a relatively attractive price for a 400 Mbps service (the lowest offered online) and a generous TV offer.

Bottom line: T-Mobile’s offering is going to be much more attractive than folks think particularly for double play. Where AT&T does not offer fiber (which we have discussed above is more parts of town than most realize) costs are high and speeds are lower then Home Internet. Cable TV costs carry broadcast and equipment rental fees that easily add $25-30/ month to the headline rate. After introductory pricing expires T-Mobile’s offer becomes even more attractive. Dropping TVision for YouTube TV was a difficult yet smart move as the examples show. Unlike cable T-Mobile would not be able to follow the “surcharge” model that Comcast and Spectrum regularly use.

The question then becomes “If T-Mobile intended Home Internet to be a user of excess capacity and demand is far greater than expected will they ration or limit the number of customers the service is available to after they have hit their fill rate?” Home Internet will definitely generate excess cash flow (especially at $60/ mo.) but eventually it will trigger new transport circuit orders (10 Gbps becomes multiple 10 Gbps). Can Home Internet scale? Will T-Mobile be able to directly connect YouTube TV servers in a given geographic area directly to the tower to minimize any latency? How will network redundancy minimize the impact of transport outages?

Most importantly will a positive Home Internet experience bring new families into the T-Mobile prepaid and postpaid fold? We remember Mike Sievert’s disclosure that 35% of the Home Internet pilot customers were new to T-Mobile. While we were originally skeptical that a $60 price point would fly it’s now looking competitive in markets where cable has little incentive to extend renewal incentives and the telco option is subpar. And the Netflix bundling options have yet to be tested.

That’s it for this week. We will add three new “Up and Comers” (one of them DC Blox) and also provide a summary of carrier earnings expectations in next week’s Brief.

The tower will stand one of Philadelphia’s tallest with a height of 567 feet. The building will hold 183 residential units which will be located on the fifth through 48th floors of the tower and the fourth floor is set to hold residential amenity space. Additional tenant spaces will be on the first through third floors as well as the 49th. The tower designed by DAS Architects & Planning and developed by Pearl Properties will feature a green roof at the top of the structure. In total the superstructure will hold 257694 square feet of space. The permit shows construction costs of $25 million but the total cost of construction is sure to be more.

The plan is to keep the façades of the existing historic structures at street level. The new tower will rise from a slight setback from the street to its full height. The building will feature tan cladding with windows and balconies arranged in columns. In between windows darker cladding will be utilized to fully form the columns which will be highly visible from vantage points throughout the city.

The structure will tower over Rittenhouse Square upon completion sitting only slightly shorter than the Laurel once that building is completed. The two buildings will begin to form a Philadelphia version of New York’s iconic Billionaire’s Row where some of America’s tallest buildings stretch into the sky above Central Park.

The tower was unveiled back in early October of 2020 and has remained highly anticipated since. It is very exciting to see the massive development move forward so quickly with permits already in hand. Pearl Properties also constructed a nearby tower dubbed The Harper which is now just one of many new towers appearing on the Rittenhouse skyline.

With the commercial building permits the tower is now close to the construction process and could conceivably begin soon potentially this Spring or Summer. It will join The Laurel on the Philadelphia skyline and will help make the skyline “stack” up to the Comcast Technology Center which serves as the city and state’s tallest building atop Philadelphia skyline.

YIMBY will continue to track the tower’s progress as the exciting journey for this skyscraper begins.

They are officially happy — for Baddoo who now is Tigers property thanks to the Rule 5 draft. But they clearly wish he were back in Minnesota’s system grooming his skills for potential big-league life at Target Field as he was before Detroit grabbed him last December.

That the Tigers might return him to the Twins — the primary option if Detroit chooses not to retain Baddoo on the 26-man active roster during all of 2021 — isn’t likely as Derek Falvey president of baseball operations for the Twins all but conceded during an interview last week with Twins media members.

Part of the transcript follows:

► Is Akil Baddoo now a bigger regret than trading Lance Lynn?

“Yeah Akil great kid through and through one of the greatest makeup kids we have in the system. Certainly what he’s done already has been tremendous through the course of his spring training and the way he’s gotten off to this start. I’m really happy for him personally on that front. I think for us as we went through the decisions to protect as we do every offseason they’re not easy decisions when you kind of get to the line and where you’re going to draw the line. He was certainly in the conversations to add to the (40-man) roster at that time. I think our position at the time was just looking at it where we were with our roster what we needed to keep open for open slots for free agency where our major league team was — and at the time our view of where Akil was relative to the major-league level. But clearly he’s got off to a tremendous start. Disappointed we don’t have him for sure especially when he goes and does that against us (Baddoo’s performance last week against the Twins). But I will tell you that I’m happy for him personally.”

► Did you even think someone would take a guy who hadn’t played in two years and only got to A ball?

“I mean what you’re identifying is probably a lot of the conversation we had in our room around just the potential for that. We always know that any player you leave open or unprotected who’s a good player which we thought Akil is and did think then and still think now that’s always a possibility. But ultimately proximity to the major leagues with what you just said a lot of time down clearly he’s done a nice job to keep himself as prepped as possible through the course of this offseason so that he could get off to the start he has.”

More: A scout’s notes and some improbable timing helped deliver Baddoo to Tigers

► Did you ever come close to protecting him?

“Yeah definitely. It’s easy to say now but I can tell you this is the truth and you can vet it with a lot of our group he’s right on that edge of the last guy or so that we were going to protect. Every year though we get to that line and you just have to make a call. You always want to protect more players. You hate to lose players. But you also get in a position where if you over-protect you really jam up your roster and then you don’t have the ability to make changes. It’s also a lot easier to claim somebody on waivers who has three options than it is sometimes to Rule 5. So that was part of the calculus for any player we add or don’t add in the process.”

It’s no secret that major corporations rely on tax loopholes to reduce their tax bill and maximize total income. A new report by the Institute of Tax and Economic Policy says that in 2020 55 major companies paid $0 in federal income tax despite collectively earning over $40 billion.

Consumer Services Energy and Communications Lead Zero Income-Tax List

The 55 companies identified by the non-profit think tank are among some of the best known brands in the world. In the consumer services section alone companies like Charter Communications (the parent of Spectrum Internet) Dish Network FedEx HP and Nike all either paid $0 in taxes or received a refund.

Energy companies were also among the major sectors that did not pay into the community chest. American Electric Power Consolidated Edison Duke Energy FirstEnergy and Xcel Energy all had either a $0 bill or a negative effective tax rate. Other big brands on the list were motor vehicle conglomerate Penske Automotive Group software giant Salesforce.com and microchip manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices.

How are the companies able to get away without paying taxes? According to the report the decades-long trend was accelerated by the passage of the CARES Act in 2020. Although the bill provided economic stimulus payments to Americans it also allowed companies to “carry back” losses from up to five years to offset income usually taxed at 35%. This allowance created $500 million in tax breaks allowing at least four companies to get to a zero-balance on their tax bill.

Other companies used creative accounting to wipe away some of their tax liability. Over 10 used executive stock option breaks to reduce their tax bills by writing off stock-option-related expenses. At least six companies used federal research and experimentation credits to significantly cut down their tax bill.

Report Comes As Top 1% Called Out for Skipping Out on 36% of Unpaid Taxes

The ITEP report comes on the heels of another investigation suggesting that America’s highest earners are responsible for over one-third of unpaid taxes. A National Bureau of Economic Research working paper suggests the wealthiest 1% may be using technology and other creative means to obfuscate their true income.

“On behalf of the St. Mary’s County Commissioners we express our deepest condolences and ask God’s Blessing upon the Somerville family” said Commissioner President Randy Guy. “Joseph Somerville will be remembered and missed.”

Joseph Lee Somerville Sr. affectionately known as (Joe Lee) was born on November 19 1939 to the late Rosia Rosie Q. M. Somerville and William S. Herbert in Loveville Maryland. He departed this life peacefully on April 1 2021 at his home. Joe Lee attended St. Joseph Colored School in Morganza MD and Banneker High School in Loveville MD graduating in 1959. Joe Lee married the love of his life Delores Briscoe on November 3 1962. Together they enjoyed 58 years of marriage until the time of his death.

In his early life Joe Lee worked as a short order cook for Bailey’s Restaurant in Leonardtown MD. He was a member of Local Union 832 and employed as a concrete finisher in Washington D.C. and as a truck driver for Charles County Concrete (now Chaney). Joe Lee was also a lifelong waterman.

In 1966 Joe Lee joined the St. Mary’s County Sheriff’s Department (later renamed the Sheriff’s Office) becoming St. Mary’s County’s first African American Deputy. Deputy Somerville was promoted to Lieutenant in 1976. In 1977 Governor Marvin Mandel appointed Lt. Somerville to Sheriff following the sudden death of then Sheriff Sanger. He was sworn in on the Courthouse steps on March 1 1977 at the age of 37. He graduated from the National Sheriff’s Institute the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Academy and the Maryland Police Training Academy. Sheriff Somerville completed the appointed term and ran for office in 1978 winning his election by an overwhelming majority. With this victory Sheriff Somerville earned the distinction of being the State of Maryland’s first African American appointed and elected Sheriff. He was the sixth African American Sheriff in the country.

Sheriff Somerville was actively involved in the Battered Spouse Education Program and youth-oriented drug and safety education programs. He established several Neighborhood Watch programs including night patrols to help stem the rise of crime. As Sheriff Joe Lee was dedicated to keeping control of the Sheriff’s Department in the hands of the local government and community. Sheriff Somerville retired from the Sheriff’s Department in 1982 following an unsuccessful re-election campaign.

Joe Lee fondly recalled memories from his time with the Sheriff’s Department. If anyone loved a job it was Joe Lee. He loved to help people. In his words “one should never be too big to help their fellow man even if you have to get down in a ditch to do it.”

Following his retirement from the Sheriff’s Department Joe Lee became a Nuclear Security Officer at the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company in Calvert County MD for 20 years retiring in 2002. He then worked for six years in the Plumbing Department at Lowe’s in California MD. It was there that Judge Karen Abrams offered him the position of Bailiff in her courtroom where he worked for 11 years. In addition Joe Lee served as the Safety Advisor with his sons’ business Somertyme Tree Service. Joe Lee was a hardworking provider for his family. His various careers spanned over 59 years; working until his health prevented him from doing so.

Joe Lee was involved in numerous community initiatives and was a member of several organizations including the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) the Board of Directors for the Maryland State Sheriff’s Boys Association Ranch the 4H Club the Community Affairs Committee and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He also served on the Board of Directors for the Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative (SMECO) but had to give up his position because he could not hold two public offices at once. Joe Lee was a member of Loveville Riders and Blue Knight Maryland IV Motorcycle Clubs.

Joe Lee received many accolades throughout his lifetime including a Governor’s Citation from Governor Marvin Mandel (1978) a Resolution from the State of Maryland House of Delegates (1979) a Governor’s Citation from Governor Harry Hughes (1983) the Constellation Energy Group Faithful Service Award (2002) a St. Mary’s County Highway Safety Program Appreciation Award for his superior support of the Driver’s Education Program (2003) a United States Colored Troops Memorial Monument Committee Community Service Award (2009) a Certificate of Appreciation from the Unified Committee for Afro-American Contributions (UCAC) (2016) and the NAACP Crystal Stair Award (2018) to name a few. One of Joe Lee’s most memorable honors was being named Honorary Crew Member by McDonald’s Corporation on April 27 1980 in recognition of his contributions to the children in the community. There is also an exhibit featuring Joe Lee and his law enforcement career at the Reginald F. Lewis Museum in Baltimore MD.

On February 22 2018 St. Mary’s County Sheriff’s Office held a program to honor Joe Lee for his contributions as Sheriff and to St. Mary’s County.

Joe Lee enjoyed hosting family and friends in his home where he took pride in serving his homemade wines eggnog and “special” beverages. He especially looked forward to hosting monthly pizza night with his “Friday Pizza Crew” where pizza and toasts were endless and the phrase “Be A Soldier” was heard. Joe Lee was a huge Washington Football Team (formerly the Redskins) fan. Joe Lee Pops Pop Pop will be remembered for his sense of humor quick wit and he will truly be missed.

Sure there are plenty of traditional-looking trophies that are treasured and will surely be part of drivers’ display cases and trophy rooms. But many of those are also subject to change — in name and design — based on the race sponsor and other than signifying another tally in the win column they might not mean much.

Instead we’re talking about the icons the staples the ones drivers can spend their careers chasing because they’re so uniquely coveted. We’re talking about the novelty trophies — whether they’re quirky funky steeped in tradition or synonymous with the track presenting them.

And NASCAR has some fantastic ones. So here is our ranking of the top-14 novelty trophies the sport’s tracks give their race winners.

14. Pocono Raceway: The Eagle Trophy

There’s a lot to take in here from Pocono’s Eagle Trophy which has been given to race winners since 1996. The soaring eagle isn’t the most remarkable fixture but it certainly stands out compared with a more traditional trophy.

13. Watkins Glen International: Corning Museum of Glass Trophy

Looking at that photo it’s understandable if your eye is immediately drawn to the bowling pin trophy — Watkins Glen has a history of wild sponsor trophies though the Cheez-It trophy is unparalleled — but that’s not the point here.

Instead focus on the custom glass trophy made by the nearby Corning Museum of Glass that celebrates both the track and the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York where it’s located. Along with the hand-sculpted center in the shape of the road course (which isn’t visible in this photo) the blue tint of it is a nod to the track’s similarly colored guard rails. Not the quirkiest of NASCAR novelty trophies but it’s still pretty cool.

12. Michigan International Speedway: The Heritage Trophy

Naturally the Michigan race track honors its winners with a trophy that celebrates the track the Motor City and the history of the auto industry in the U.S. But it’s not actually awarded to the driver. Since 2013 the trophy has been presented to the winning manufacturer — either Chevrolet Ford or Toyota.

Inspired by the Stanley Cup the trophy is about 50 pounds and more than three feet tall. While the base is an ode to landmark Detroit buildings the sculpture on top resembles Nike the ancient Greek goddess of victory who also served as an inspiration for hood ornaments from Cadillac Rolls-Royce and Packard.

11. Talladega Superspeedway: The Vulcan Trophy

With another hat tip to ancient mythology Talladega presents Cup race winners with the Vulcan Trophy inspired by the Roman god of fire and the Vulcan statue in Birmingham Alabama not far from the superspeedway. The hot-poured iron trophy weighs more than 130 pounds.

10. Phoenix Raceway: Live painting in victory lane

A trophy that’s also art is fabulous but a trophy that’s also art and created on the spot is even better. Artist Bill Patterson generally begins painting his canvas with a few laps remaining in the race and quickly completes it with the respective winners — and sometimes the runner-up — according to the track. And then the winning driver signs it.

However the only strike against this novelty trophy is the fact that the driver doesn’t get to keep it — the track does though the winning teams often commission more. Still a live painting from victory lane is decidedly impressive.

9. Texas Motor Speedway: Six-shooter revolvers a cowboy hat and a cowboy boot trophy

These are some quintessential Texas novelty awards right here with the winner dressed in victory lane looking like a cowboy. The trophies are unlike anything else presented to NASCAR race winners but given the rampant gun violence in the U.S. it’s time for Texas Motor Speedway to reconsider ditching the six-shooters and stick with the hat and cowboy-boot trophy.

8. Charlotte Motor Speedway: A vintage Coca-Cola vending machine

For the Coca-Cola 600 — one of NASCAR’s “crown jewel” races which is held at the iconic Charlotte track — the winning driver receives a traditional piston-style award called the Bruton Smith Trophy.

But the real specialty item here is the restored vintage Coke machine which the track has been giving out since 2010. How fun is that? And a perfect novelty trophy for an important race with a consistent sponsor.

7. Daytona International Speedway: The Harley J. Earl Trophy

The Harley J. Earl trophy given to the winner of the Daytona 500 is this high on the list mostly because of the massive accomplishment it is to get your name engraved on it. And there are actually two.

The Harley J. Earl Perpetual Trophy is the massive one that includes the names of every Daytona 500 winner weighs more than 100 pounds and stays at the famous Daytona track. But the winner gets a smaller replica weighing in at 54 pounds with the bronze Firebird One car on top weighing 22 pounds. That car takes about seven months to complete.

6. Auto Club Speedway: A surfboard

Would you expect anything else from a southern California track? In addition to the rad surfboard trophy the winners get immediately after the race they’re also honored the following season when NASCAR returns to Fontana.

Although it’s a year later the previous race winner gets a custom-made surfboard which makes for an awesome novelty trophy.

5. Sonoma Raceway: A massive wine goblet

Wine is a phenomenal prize for a hard day’s work whether or not you’re in wine country. In this case Sonoma Raceway goes all out with an incredible wine goblet along with a huge wine-themed trophy that’s complete with a bottle made for the size of the goblet.

4. Dover International Speedway: The Monster Trophy

OK look: This is not exactly a surfboard or a wine goblet or a vintage anything but Dover’s Monster Trophy has to be among the best.

The track nicknamed “The Monster Mile” has been giving this to race winners since 2004 and it has to be the most peculiar and odd one given out. But its weirdness is what makes it great and it’s even able to hold a replica of the race winner’s car.

3. Bristol Motor Speedway: A gladiator sword

A gladiator sword is exactly the kind of novelty trophy you’d expect from the short track nicknamed “The Last Great Colosseum.” It’s a wild and larger-than-you-think kind of prize and as the most recent Bristol winner Joey Logano demonstrated you can have a lot of (somewhat dangerous) fun chopping random things with it. A cool trophy that can also help you trim your hedges.

“It kind of feels good too just to chop stuff with a sword” Logano said about his recently discovered recreational activities.

2. New Hampshire Motor Speedway: Loudon the Lobster

A race win in New England obviously means a lobster trophy but the one New Hampshire gives out is typically between 18 and 22 pounds — though the one Hamlin is holding was reportedly a whopping 44 pounds. And it’s alive. While this novelty trophy is not No. 1 on this list it’s definitely the most exceptional one.

Unfortunately for Hamlin his self-described “lobster phobia” probably prevented him from enjoying the trophy. When asked in 2017 what he planned to do with it — the shell is typically preserved hand-painted and mounted on a plaque — Hamlin said “I’m not going to do anything with it. I’ve seen it and touched it for the last time. I have a lobster phobia. I don’t know why. I just don’t like them. I cannot eat dinner if someone beside me is eating lobster. I can’t look at it. So as far as I’m concerned they need to put it back in the water and let it live.”

1. Martinsville Speedway: A grandfather clock

Martinsville’s grandfather clock is the obvious choice for NASCAR’s best novelty trophy. It’s arguably the most coveted trophy on the schedule and NASCAR drivers like Brad Keselowski Jimmie Johnson and Dale Earnhardt Jr. have said as much.

Why? It’s a valuable piece of furniture you’d want to display proudly in your home rather than in a trophy room and there’s a unique level of prestige associated with winning the clock.

As Johnson — who won nine grandfather clocks tying him for third-most with Jeff Gordon — explained to For The Win in 2019:

“We get a lot of big trophies and most are plastic. … To actually have — I don’t know if it should be called an art piece — a significant piece of furniture that you can proudly display in your home it crosses over into that furniture category as well as a major achievement. They go right into houses because it’s not your typical trophy. Looking at that as a young driver you think ‘Wow I can’t afford a grandfather clock. But I can go win one.’”

And after this weekend's Blue-Emu Maximum Pain Relief 500 at Martinsville another grandfather clock will be given out.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZXJrc2hpcmVlYWdsZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9oYW5jb2NrLXNoYWtlci12aWxsYWdlLWFwcG9pbnRzLWN1cmF0b3ItZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtZGlyZWN0b3IvYXJ0aWNsZV9jM2ViMDIyYS05MTg3LTExZWItYWRjMi0yYjE5MmFmZmJkZTIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hancock Shaker Village appoints curator development director | Local News | berkshireeagle.com,"You have permission to edit this article.

Former aide Lindsay Boylan 36 was the first woman to accuse Cuomo of sexual harassment in a Medium post on February 24. She claimed that the governor asked her to play strip poker and kissed her on the lips without her permission when she worked for him in 2017.

Lindsay Boylan 36

Charlotte Bennett 25

Charlotte Bennett 25 came forward a few days after Boylan and claimed that Cuomo sexually harassed her last June while she was working as a health policy adviser in his administration at the height of the COVID-19 crisis.

Bennett accused Cuomo of 'grooming' her and asking inappropriate questions about her sex life.

She also claimed that he told her he was open to dating women in their 20s.

BENNETT said the governor asked her about her love life - including whether she ever had sex with older men - and talked about his own saying that age differences didn't matter in relationships and he was open to dating women over 22.

During a meeting alone in his office the governor said he was lonely and talked about wanting to hug someone Bennett said.

She said she swiftly complained to Cuomo's chief of staff and was transferred to another job.

She said she spoke to a lawyer for the governor but didn´t insist on further action because she liked her new post and wanted to move on.

Charlotte Bennett 25

Anna Ruch 33

Anna Ruch was the third woman to accuse Cuomo of sexual harassment and the only one thus far who did not work with him in a professional capacity. She claimed that Cuomo put his hands on her face and asked if he could kiss her just moments after they met at a September 2019 wedding in Manhattan.

Anna Ruch 33

Ana Liss 35

Ana Liss 35 a former aide said Cuomo asked her whether she had a boyfriend once kissed her hand at her desk and called her by patronizing names including 'blondie' 'sweetheart' and 'honey.'

At a reception the governor hugged her then put his arm around her lower back and waist as they posed for photo Liss said.

She said she eventually asked for a job transfer. In an interview Liss said she was 'not claiming sexual harassment per se' but felt the administration 'wasn't a safe space for young women to work.'

Liss who previously served as Cuomo's policy and operations aide between 2013 and 2015 told the Wall Street Journal that during her time in his administration the governor had subjected her to unsolicited advances including touching her lower back kissing her hand and quizzing her about her love life.

Ana Liss 35

Karen Hinton 62

The oldest allegations against Cuomo came from Karen Hinton who served as a press aide for him when he led the US Department of Housing and Urban Development two decades ago and she was a consultant for the agency. Hinton told the Washington Post about a 2000 incident when she said Cuomo summoned her to his 'dimly lit' hotel room and embraced her after a work event. She said she tried to pull away from Cuomo when he pulled her back and held her before she managed to escape the room.

Karen Hinton 62

Unnamed sixth accuser

The most damning allegations leveled against Cuomo to date came from a sixth accuser whose name has not been released.

The accuser who is a member of Cuomo's staff alleged that he closed a door reached under her blouse and fondled her after summoning her to the governor's mansion in Albany for help with his cellphone according to the Times Union of Albany.

It first reported on her accusation last month; she then gave more detail in her first interview on the matter.

The woman spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her privacy although her identity is known within the governor´s circle the Times Union reported.

The woman an executive assistant told the Times Union the governor gave her kisses on the cheek and inappropriately tight hugs for years and made remarks including 'If you were single the things that I would do to you' and 'I'm single and ready to mingle.'

Then one day in November she was summoned to his Executive Mansion office to help him with a cellphone problem she said.

He got up from his desk started groping her and told her 'I don't care' after she tried to deflect him by saying he was going to get them into trouble and then he slammed the door she said.

Then he reached under her blouse and clutched one of her breasts over her bra she told the newspaper.

The woman told a colleague this winter about the alleged encounter and the co-worker told a supervisor in early March according to the newspaper.

Cuomo called the report 'gut-wrenching' in a March statement and said: 'I have never done anything like this.'

Another female aide who has remained anonymous claimed he called her to his Executive Mansion last year reached under her blouse and fondled her

Jessica Bakeman

Jessica Bakeman claimed in a first-person article for New York Magazine that she was sexually harassed by Cuomo on several occasions since the start of her journalism career in 2012.

Bakeman added her voice as the seventh accuser as she detailed inappropriate touching by the governor as he continued to deny all of the claims.

'He took my hand as if to shake it then refused to let go' Bakeman wrote of an interaction with Cuomo as she said goodnight at a holiday party in 2014 when she was only 25 years old.

'He put his other arm around my back his hand on my waist and held me firmly in place while indicating to a photographer he wanted us to pose for a picture.'

At the time Bakeman had been working for what is now Politico New York and claimed that red flags went up as her 'job was to analyze and scrutinize him'.

'I didn't want a photo of him with his hands on my body and a smile on my face' she wrote.

Jessica Bakeman a reporter who once covered the Cuomo administration was the seventh woman to come forward with claims of harassment

'But I made the reflexive assessment that most women and marginalized people know instinctively the calculation about risk and power and self-preservation. I knew it would be far easier to smile for the brief moment it takes to snap a picture than to challenge one of the most powerful men in the country.'

In an earlier 2012 incident while she was working for USA Today Bakeman also claims that Cuomo kept her pinned to his side as he told a story to her male colleagues.

'He left it there and kept me pinned next to him for several minutes as he finished telling his story' she said. 'I stood there my cheeks hot giggling nervously as my male colleagues did the same. We all knew it was wrong but we did nothing.'

The reporter who now works in Florida claimed that Cuomo 'never let me forget I was a woman' as she also alleged that he made frequent attempts to humiliate her including calling out her purple phone instead of answering her question during a press gaggle.

Alyssa McGrath 33

McGrath a current administrative assistant in Cuomo's office told The New York Times that he looked down her shirt quizzed her about her marital status and told her she was beautiful using an Italian phrase she had to ask her parents to interpret.

McGrath didn't say the governor made sexual contact with her but thought his behavior was sexual harassment.

She recalled Cuomo kissing her on the forehead and gripping her firmly around the sides while posing for a photo at a 2019 office Christmas party.

Alyssa McGrath (pictured) is one of two aides who have come forward to accuse the governor of harassment

Sherry Vill 55

Sherry Vill 55 accused Cuomo of sexual misconduct during a press conference with her attorney Gloria Allred on Monday.

She alleges Cuomo grabbed her face and kissed her 'aggressively and in a sexual manner' on both cheeks in May 2017 while he was touring her home in Greece near Rochester as he inspected local flood damage.

Vill who said she felt uncomfortable at the time shared an image her daughter took on the day that showed Cuomo holding her face as he kissed her cheek and her attorney held up multiple photos showing the Governor inside her home.

The same photos appear on Cuomo's Flickr account as well as multiple others that show him kissing and greeting residents as he toured the town.

None of the women in the other photos have accused the governor of inappropriate behavior or wrongdoing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnl1Z2F0ZWNoLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FzdXMtcm9nLXBob25lLTUtcGgtcHJpY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ASUS ROG Phone 5 Classic 5 Pro 5 Ultimate specs price in the Philippines,"ASUS Philippines has officially launched the latest gaming smartphones the ROG Phone 5 Classic ROG Phone 5 Pro and ROG Phone 5 Ultimate.

The $34 billion-valued company (Nasdaq: CSGP) recently struck a lease to take up a full building at Spectrum Terrace Irvine Co.’s collection of just-built mid-rise offices along the San Diego (405) Freeway.



The nearly 115000-square-foot deal is more than three times the size of CoStar’s current local base of operations at the Park Place office campus a few miles away near the intersection of Michelson Drive and Jamboree Road.



It’s the second-largest reported office lease in OC made so far this year trailing Anduril’s record-breaking deal for The Press a 640000-square-foot office campus currently under construction in Costa Mesa.

Consolidation Expansion



CoStar’s new lease is for 17600 Laguna Canyon Road a 114700-square-foot office part of Spectrum Terrace’s second phase.



The new space will replace CoStar’s current local hub at Park Place’s 3161 Michelson office tower where it occupies some 37600 square feet including the entire 16th floor.



As CoStar continues to operate largely remote for the time being it’s looking to sublease that space before it moves into its new digs by the end of the year.



CoStar also owns Irvine’s Ten-X a platform for commercial real estate online auctions that occupies a roughly 21000-square-foot building at 15295 Alton Parkway; CoStar said it isn’t yet looking to sublease that space.



It bought the commercial real estate division of Ten-X last year for about $190 million.



The full-building Spectrum Terrace lease starts June 1 and runs through late 2028.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhYm9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2tpbS1qdW5naHl1bi1ydWRlLWdpcmxzLWdlbmVyYXRpb24tc2VvaHl1bi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Actor Kim Jung Hyun's ""Rude Attitude"" To Girls' Generation's Seohyun Comes Back Into The Spotlight","Netizens reveal that his fans had pushed the blame to Seohyun back then.

On or off the set I’m trying to live as Cheon Soo Ho (the character). When I’m sleeping or commuting I slip and let Kim Jung Hyun come out. I’m trying to control that. I’m just really devoted to the character. I’m really trying to become him. — Kim Jung Hyun 2018

However with the new report in 2021 O& Entertainment shockingly announced that both his departure from the drama and the attitude issues were due to personal issues involving a woman.

We announced that he left for health reasons at the time but there were issues with Kim Jung Hyun’s attitude since the press conference for the drama due to personal issues involving a woman. That’s what led to him ultimately leaving the show. — O& Entertainment

As the issue is coming back into the spotlight with his dispute and dating rumors with actress Seo Ji Hye fans have revisited the issue. It was newly pointed out that Seohyun was in fact a senior to Kim Jung Hyun in the acting industry at that point in time even making his behavior rather rude.

Seohyun debuted as an idol in 2007 while Kim Junghyun debuted in 2014 in an indie short film. She has 7 years on him as a senior in the entertainment industry. In the acting industry Seohyun debuted with her first significant role in 2013’s Passionate Love.

Netizens have pointed out that his fans had changed the narrative on Kim Jung Hyun’s Wikitree page on purpose claiming that “Although his co-star had debuted as an idol first that is of a different industry. As an actor Kim Jung Hyun debuted a year earlier and he is in fact the senior here.” It goes on to criticize Seohyun as an unseasoned actor and her fans for creating a fuss about Kim Jung Hyun’s attitude praising Kim Jung Hyun for his acting instead.

Netizens have since renewed their view of Kim Jung Hyun and criticized him for his behavior. Kim Jung Hyun has yet to speak out on the situation or against his agency’s claims.",,,,,,,,,

Costco will carry four individually wrapped turkeys per case with Walmart and Kroger stores offering single whole turkeys in fresh and frozen meat cases. The size of the turkeys range from 10 to 15 lbs. Crescent Foods said a number of regional independent and online retailers will also sell halal turkey items.

“The demand for halal hand-cut turkey is here to stay and it’s growing stronger each year” said Huthyfah Abed executive national sales director for Crescent Foods. “We are able to bring everything together with our offerings: the household name of Crescent Foods the experience and integrity of our farm partner and premium attributes like a vegetarian-fed diet and no-antibiotics-ever all on a national scale.”

Abed added that Crescent has a market advantage it wants to share with retail partners as Muslim-Americans celebrate Thanksgiving with halal turkey.

The company revealed some survey data from 11000 consumers of which 96% of respondents self-identified as Muslim-American. The survey said that nearly 99% celebrate Thanksgiving at home or at the home of a relative. Crescent also found that 62% celebrate with close family members and more than half celebrate with at least five and up to 12 people.

“Our survey results demonstrate that Muslim-Americans just like all Americans enjoy celebrating Thanksgiving with their families most often with halal turkey” Abed said. “Our retail partners are embracing this opportunity to serve an ever-growing diverse population. When it comes down to it as Americans we have a lot more in common than we think we do especially when it comes to honoring our family and relationships as we share Thanksgiving meals together.”"

Matt Smith who portrayed Prince Philip on The Crown has paid tribute to the late royal.

On Friday (9 April) Buckingham Palace announced in a statement that the 99-year-old Duke of Edinburgh had “passed away peacefully” at Windsor Castle.

Prince Philip had been portrayed in Netflix’s The Crown by Smith and in his later years by Tobias Menzies. Jonathan Pryce will play the royal in the show’s forthcoming final two seasons.

In a statement Smith expressed his sorrow at Prince Philip’s death while dubbing him “the man”.

“I’d like to offer my condolences to Her Majesty the Queen and the Royal Family” Smith wrote. “Prince Philip was the man. And he knew it. 99 and out but what an innings. And what style.”

Smith continued: “Thank you for your service old chap – it won’t be the same without you.”

In his own statement Menzies declared: “If I know anything about the Duke of Edinburgh I’m fairly sure he wouldn’t want an actor who portrayed him on TV giving their opinion on his life so I’ll leave it to Shakespeare.”

Menzies then quoted a line of dialogue from the Bard’s As You Like It writing: “O good old man! How well in thee appears / the constant service of the antique world…”

It is unclear if Prince Philip had watched The Crown though it was previously reported that he had been asked at a dinner party whether he had. “Don’t be ridiculous” he allegedly replied.

The makers of The Crown previously released a statement on the Duke’s death writing that they were “deeply saddened” by his passing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvd25hbmRjb3VudHJ5bWFnLmNvbS9zb2NpZXR5L3RyYWRpdGlvbi9hMzU4NjcyMTkvcXVlZW4tZWxpemFiZXRoLXJlbGF0ZWQtdG8tbm9yd2VnaWFuLXJveWFsLWZhbWlseS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Queen Elizabeth Is Related to the Norwegian Royal Family,"Tonight's episode of Atlantic Crossing shows King Haakan and Crown Prince Olav seeking refuge at Buckingham Palace in London during the German occupation of Norway. Upon their entrance you can hear King George call King Haakan ""uncle"" and Olav ""cousin.""

And when Haakan says ""Thanks for taking us in"" Queen Elizabeth the future Queen Mother can be heard saying ""That's what family's for isn't it?"" But how exactly are the British royals and the Norwegian royals related?

As with so many interconnected monarchies it all goes back to Queen Victoria and Christian IX of Denmark.

Nicknamed the grandmother and father-in-law of Europe Victoria and Christian were known for the matchmaking prowess and their ability to marry their descendants into other royal families across the continent. The Norwegian royal family is one such example.

Notably King Haakan was the grandson of Christian IX and his wife Maud of Wales was the granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Maud's brother was King George V; therefore King Haakan is King George VI's uncle by marriage and Crown Prince Olav is his first cousin.

The current monarchs of the UK and Norway are also closely related. Queen Elizabeth (the daughter of King George VI) and King Harald of Norway (the son of Crown Prince Olav) are second cousins.

As Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip are themselves third cousins and Prince Philip is also a direct descendent of Queen Victoria King Harald is also independently related to him.

Britain's Prince Philip husband of Queen Elizabeth II has died Buckingham Palace said Friday. He was 99.

""It is with deep sorrow that Her Majesty The Queen announces the death of her beloved husband His Royal Highness The Prince Philip Duke of Edinburgh"" the palace said in a statement. ""The Royal Family join with people around the world in mourning his loss.""

The prince ""passed away peacefully"" on Friday morning at Windsor Castle according to the palace. He had recently spent a month in the hospital returning to the castle on March 16.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson expressed his condolences in a statement saying ""Prince Philip earned the affection of generations here in the United Kingdom across the Commonwealth and around the world.""

""Like the expert carriage driver that he was he helped to steer the royal family and the monarchy so that it remains an institution indisputably vital to the balance and happiness of our national life"" Johnson said.

Born Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark he married then Princess Elizabeth in 1947 and spent around 70 years supporting the queen before retiring from royal duties in 2017.

He was a patron of many organizations including serving as the president of the World Wide Fund for Nature and actively promoted causes in environmental protection science and sports.

A naval commander during World War II he had also spoken about being in Tokyo during Japan's surrender in 1945.

Prince Philip had close exchanges with the Japanese imperial family with then Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko visiting Britain as a state guest in 1998.

In 2001 he also met with Japanese Emperor Naruhito at Windsor Castle when he visited Britain as crown prince and gave the Japanese royal a tour of a library in the castle.

Prince Philip also visited Japan several times including as part of WWF activities.

We’re republishing this November 2020 story to commemorate his life and legacy in the royal family.



Episode 2 of The Crown season 4 sets up a truly delicious dramatic scenario: a long weird weekend at Balmoral Castle during which the royal family is visited not only by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (Gillian Anderson) but also by Diana Spencer (Emma Corrin) Prince Charles’s new girlfriend and future wife.

The episode is named “The Balmoral Test” a reference to the long-rumored royal initiation to which newbies are subjected at the Queen’s estate in Aberdeenshire. Diana creates a strong first impression at dinner mostly by being charmingly meek and self-deprecating but the real test comes the following morning when Prince Philip takes her out on a hunting expedition.

Diana acquits herself extremely well during her outing with Philip cheerfully declaring herself a “country girl at heart” as she helps him catch a rare stag. With Philip’s stamp of approval Diana’s relationship with Charles is officially on the fast track. But how close is this to the truth? Here’s a rundown.

Did Diana & Philip actually hunt together?

In The Crown a rare imperial stag is spotted on the grounds of Balmoral. Our favorite members of the royal family are obsessed with finding it because killing an imperial stag means you win your name on the placard underneath its display head in the grand old tradition of hunting innocent animals for sport. (The fact that Diana’s first visit to the castle coincides with the royals trying to ensnare an innocent doe-eyed animal that has no idea it’s walking into a trap…well the subtext is right there for the taking.)

Philip takes Diana out for a hunting expedition that doubles as a friendly interrogation and the pair end up getting along famously. Diana impresses her future father-in-law by being unafraid to get her hands dirty (literally and figuratively) and helping him to track down and slay the imperial stag.

“We have Diana to thank” Philip says as the duo triumphantly return to the castle with their prize. “You spotted him not me” Diana of course is quick to demur which only endears her to Philip even more. “You shot him sir. It wasn’t an easy shot” she enthuses. “It was brilliant!” Hooray for bloodsports! Afterwards Charles grimly tells Camilla (the actual love of his life) that Diana got “rave reviews” from everybody including Philip and the queen. It’s promptly made clear to Charles that he should lock this down ASAP and propose to Diana.

So did this really happen? As far as we can tell Diana and Philip going hunting together was a scenario invented by Peter Morgan and his writers—but not an implausible one according to former royal butler Grant Harrold.

“If [the queen] invites you to Balmoral then you are being invited to spend time with the royal family in a personal setting” Harrold told the Scottish newspaper The Daily Record. “You are going to be out on the hills with the Queen or other members of the Royal Family perhaps fishing hunting or doing other country pursuits.”

As depicted in the show Diana would have felt at home in this kind of environment unlike Margaret Thatcher who finds the whole thing baffling. The Spencer family had long-standing ties to the royals—Diana’s grandmothers served as ladies-in-waiting to the Queen Mother—so hunting and other upper-class outdoorsy activities wouldn’t be at all alien to Diana.

There is one real-life incident that may have inspired this Diana/Philip storyline: According to The Daily Express Diana drew controversy in the 1980s after she was photographed on a hunting trip with Charles shortly before their wedding. She was reportedly accused of “cruelly wounding a stag” and afterwards took part in a ceremony where a hunter's forehead is smeared with the blood of their first kill. Okey-dokey then! The same report notes Diana lost her taste for bloodsports after this experience and vowed never to take part again.

Did Philip like Diana in real life?

There are a lot of conflicting reports about this. At least one from CNN suggests Philip was “unkind” to Diana. But this seems to be contradicted by the tone of many letters he wrote to his daughter-in-law as her marriage to Charles was on the rocks. In one letter per The Daily Mail he told her he wanted to do his “utmost to help you and Charles to the best of my ability. But I am quite ready to concede that I have no talent as a marriage counsellor!” In another he went much further sympathizing with Diana and putting much of the blame for the marriage’s failure on Charles.

We do not approve of either of you having lovers. Charles was silly to risk everything with Camilla for a man in his position. We never dreamed he might feel like leaving you for her. I cannot imagine anyone in their right mind leaving you for Camilla. Such a prospect never even entered our heads.

Diana for her part was grateful for Philip’s support and made that clear in her responses. In one letter she wrote: “Dearest Pa I was particularly touched by your most recent letter which proved to me if I did not already know it that you really do care. You are very modest about your marriage guidance skills and I disagree with you!”

But things took a turn after the publication of Andrew Morton’s 1992 biography Diana Her True Story–In Her Own Words. Prince Philip reportedly wrote a series of letters to Diana at this point which “upset and infuriated” the princess. In one he reportedly told her that her “irrational” behavior and jealousy were to blame for many of her marital problems with Charles. In another he bluntly told her that being part of the royal family “involved much more than simply being a hero with the British people.”

All in all it’s fair to say that Diana and Philip’s relationship was complicated. In a recent interview with People Tobias Menzies suggested the two found some common ground because both came into the royal family as “outsiders” but that his version of Philip made a miscalculation in meeting Diana. “He ends up underestimating her actually which is slightly paternal blindness arguably sexism” he said. “He is very beguiled by this beautiful young woman and doesn’t really register the turbulence that is clearly in her which ends up being very destructive to the family and obviously fatal to herself.”

What does that mean for future regional passenger rail service?,"If passenger rail service were to return to central Maine it would probably not be because of Amtrak’s 2035 vision plan.

Amtrak released its plan in late March after President Joe Biden unveiled his nationwide plan for investing in infrastructure — roads and bridges communication networks sewerage water and electrical systems and other structures and facilities needed for society to function.

Part of Amtrak’s plan includes expanding Downeaster service to Rockland the only addition in Maine. Experts’ opinions vary on what this means for central Maine.

“Maine’s not going to get very much out of this at all under the current circumstance” said Richard Rudolph chairman of the Rail Users’ Network and director of Maine Rail Group a nonprofit working to enhance rail service in the state and beyond. “At best you’ll get weekend service to Rockland. That’s all.”

Amtrak’s Downeaster route began regular runs in 2001 between Portland and Boston and expanded northward to Brunswick in 2012. Today the Downeaster makes Maine stops in Brunswick Freeport Portland Old Orchard Saco and Wells and multiple stops in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. The final destination is Boston’s North Station.

An Amtrak spokesperson wrote in an email the company met with stakeholders across the country and used their input in formulating the plan. Amtrak hopes Congress will provide the $80 billion designated for rail in Biden’s American Jobs Plan as part of the long-range effort.

Amtrak officials did not respond to multiple requests for Maine-specific information.

“The map represents our vision for growing rail service and connecting new city pairs across America to rise to the urgent challenges of our time by providing new and improved train service for 20 million more riders” the spokesperson wrote. “With a growing and diverse population a global climate crisis and longer traffic jams America needs a rail network that offers frequent reliable sustainable and equitable train service.”

The Portland-based New England Passenger Rail Authority or NNERPA operates the Downeaster. Created by the Maine State Legislature in 1995 in response to a public initiative by TrainRiders Northeast NNERPA continues to provide public transportation service and explore expansions.

Related Opinions differ on potential impact as Waterville rail yard is sold to CSX

NNEPRA Executive Director Patricia Quinn cautioned Amtrak’s plan is a vision that needs federal funding. Quinn said believes it is good news for the state but warned not everything on the plan is definite.

“The timing is good and we applaud that vision” Quinn said “but what’s on or what’s not on that map is not necessarily indicative of what will happen moving forward. You really need to look at what they’ve laid out as a list of potentials and it’s not a complete list.”

Quinn noted the Downeaster’s Brunswick expansion was always part of the plan and there have not been substantial talks by the NNERPA to expand to central Maine.

“I know there’s interest and we’re happy there’s interest in passenger rail” Quinn said. “These are legacy investments and we’re working with the Maine Department of Transportation to see what their vision is for a rail network within the state.”

Nathan Moulton director of the MDOT’s Office of Freight and Passenger Services emphasized in an email that Amtrak’s plan was not made with the state or NNERPA’s approval. He said the MDOT is working on a plan for a siding project at the Wells station exploring a possible relocation of the Portland station and adding a new passenger platform in Falmouth. No plans in central Maine at least for now.

“Right now in regard to passenger rail in Maine” Moulton wrote “we are continuing to work with NNEPRA to keep the current system viable in the pandemic and watching to see how ridership comes back as we emerge from the pandemic.”

But George O’Keefe a rail policy advocate and economic development director in Rumford said he believes Amtrak’s plan is a positive development. The extended service to Rockland signals an opportunity for increased growth he said.

O’Keefe wrote in an email it could be possible to add passenger rail service between Portland Lewiston and Waterville with a stop in Belgrade on Route 27. There could also be a potential stop in Winthrop giving Augusta residents two potential nearby stops.

“This option would ensure deserving communities receive service and also provide a vision for future service to Central and Western Maine that is lacking in any potential plans to run service via Gardiner and Hallowell” O’Keefe wrote.

“Improved service is positive for Maine generally and will help rebuild a travel mode that is very compatible with the geography and demography of our cities and towns.”

The railroad tracks that run from Brunswick through Augusta Waterville and up to Bangor are owned by Massachusetts-based Pan Am Railways. The tracks are in the process of being sold to CSX Corp. a massive freight rail system whose tracks cross nearly every state east of the Mississippi River.

Part of Maine Central Railroad’s freight and passenger rail service before its sale in 1983 the soon-to-be CSX Corp. tracks include the Waterville Yard. CSX is a Class I railroad meaning it is one of the nation’s eight largest railroads including Amtrak.

Maine Central’s passenger service ended in 1960. It remains unclear how the acquisition impacts central Maine businesses as expert opinions differ.

In terms of passenger rail Rudolph and his groups are pushing for an extension of the Downeaster through Augusta and Waterville. Bangor Waterville and Augusta have passed resolutions asking the state to conduct a feasibility study.

Sen. Joe Baldacci D-Bangor and seven legislative co-sponsors introduced legislation to provide $300000 from the state’s multimodal fund to pay for such a study. The next step would be a feasibility analysis. Rudolph said he sees passenger rail service in central Maine as having potential to boost the region’s economy.

Passenger rail service in central Maine may not be coming in the near future through Amtrak but it is not to be ruled out.

“The feasibility study is the first step to restoring service in Bangor Waterville and Augusta” Rudolph said. “Our goal is to get (the study) done within the next year.”

The 30-year-old Barbadian who signed an eight-game deal with Kent last month bowled left-hander Ben Curran off the under-edge for 24 in his second over – the third over before the close at Wantage Road – as the hosts finished on 91 for one in reply to Kent’s massive 455.

Ricardo Vasconcelos was unbeaten on 54 having put on 77 for the first wicket with Curran on a rain-hit day in the East Midlands.

Cummins had earlier struck a valuable 24 in a 63-run last wicket stand which helped veteran Darren Stevens to an unbeaten 116 – his 35th first class hundred.

Stevens who turns 45 later this month faced 134 balls in 3-¾ hours and counted 15 fours and two sixes.

Resuming the day on 34 with Kent on 309 for seven thanks to Jack Leaning’s 79 and Jordan Cox’s 62 on the opening day Stevens put on 64 for the ninth wicket with number 10 Harry Podmore (28) before finding an ally in Cummins to complete triple figures.

The left-handed Cummins defied the Northants bowlers for nearly an hour and struck four fours before losing his middle stump to new ball seamer Tom Taylor.

Afterwards Stevens praised Cummins for the partnership which saw him to his hundred.

“I’m really appreciative of the tail helping me out” said Stevens.

“I was an angry man when Podmore got out because I thought we were going really nicely and I’d not batted with Miguel before.

“So I said to him ‘do you want to face spin or seam?’ and he said ‘I’m good man’.”

Cummins who has played 14 Tests and 11 One-Day Internationals for West Indies saw a three-year deal at Middlesex upended by the COVID-19 pandemic but was able to secure a contract with Kent for the new season.

And Stevens said he believed the right-armer would be asset for Kent in the ongoing affair against Northants.

“We bowled pretty poorly but Miguel looks like he’s a bit of a handful and I think he’ll be key for us.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtOTQ1Nzc5Ny9Dcmlja2V0LXN0YXItUGF0LUN1bW1pbnMtc2VsbHMtQ2xvdmVsbHktYXBhcnRtZW50LXdob3BwaW5nLTMtN21pbGxpb24uaHRtbNIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtOTQ1Nzc5Ny9hbXAvQ3JpY2tldC1zdGFyLVBhdC1DdW1taW5zLXNlbGxzLUNsb3ZlbGx5LWFwYXJ0bWVudC13aG9wcGluZy0zLTdtaWxsaW9uLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cricket star Pat Cummins sells Clovelly apartment for a whopping $3.7million,"Cricket star Pat Cummins and his interior designer fiancée Becky Boston have sold their Clovelly apartment.

Yesterday Minister of Tourism Senator Lisa Cummins who acknowledged that with little known regarding how long the volcano would continue to spew ash into the atmosphere causing closure of Barbadian airspace due to reduced visibility the development could place a spanner in the works as it relates to the country’s ambitions to open up to vaccinated travellers.

Speaking during a virtual press conference at Illaro Court yesterday Cummins said that like what has been done during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the country must once again dig deep into its resources of adaptability and resilience to mitigate this latest threat to the sector.

“A few weeks ago we were dealing with COVID-19 alone and we were dealing with lockdowns and whether there were flights coming in. Now we are dealing with a totally different scenario which is a combination of COVID-19 and volcanic ash affecting our airspace. If there is one thing that we are clear about is that we don’t have any promises or guarantees about what tomorrow would hold. What we have to do is plan and mitigate for all of the risk that we are being presented and adjust as quickly as we can. So let’s hope that come May 8 we are in a position to see a clearing of the skies and in a position where the infection rate is under control in our source markets” she explained. (CLM)

Coinbase one of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency trading platforms is soon to become open for trading to the general public. The company announced Thursday that its trading debut via a direct listing on the Nasdaq is expected to take place on April 14.

Bitcoin and Dogecoin recently experienced what Forbes called a “crypto gold rush.” Is Coinbase set to attract a gold rush of its own?

Here’s what to know about Coinbase and what its initial public offering could mean for you.

What Is Coinbase?

If you want to get your virtual hands on some Bitcoin you can either “mine” it yourself with expensive computing equipment and a supply of energy sufficient to operate it or you can purchase currency that has already been extracted. Most people choose the latter and for many that method of choice is Coinbase.

Coinbase has been around since 2012. It envisions a future where fiat currency has been replaced by cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is the most notable example of these but it is still only one of many.

Since then however people have primarily invested in cryptocurrencies. Rather than using them as cash they have treated them more like stocks or precious metals than currency.

Coinbase’s role in all this is that it allows users to purchase and sell these cryptocurrencies and offers a place to keep them — a digital wallet — in the meantime.

How Does Coinbase Make Money?

When someone completes a transaction on Coinbase they pay fees for the privilege of using the service. One of these is the Coinbase fee. This is either a flat rate or a variable percentage. It is based on the user’s region product feature and payment type.

Coinbase’s other fee is the margin or spread of up to 2.00% of the transaction. This is added to the exchange rate on Coinbase Pro — the trading platform tied to Coinbase where all orders are fulfilled.

Coinbase also has a few other revenue streams that continue to grow over time:

Coinbase Pro: A platform that enables users to trade directly on the Coinbase exchange that backs their Coinbase transactions

Coinbase Commerce: A software-as-a-service product that provides payment processing for online merchants

Coinbase Card: A physical Visa debit card that converts cryptocurrency to U.S. dollars enabling users to make purchases anywhere Visa cards are accepted

USD Coin (USDC): A cryptocurrency offered by Coinbase with a value tied directly to the U.S. dollar whereby there is always a 1-to-1 relationship between the two

How Much Is Coinbase Worth?

Placing a dollar value on startups is tricky but the company’s worth has skyrocketed over the last few years. Coinbase’s last formal valuation came in 2018 when it received $300 million in E-series funding and was reportedly worth $8 billion. That number has since jumped into the double digits with Nasdaq Private Market activity in early March of 2021 indicating a value as high as $77 billion.

Story continues

Keep in mind that Coinbase is well positioned as a startup to have a higher IPO than even private trades suggest. With a 2020 revenue of $1.3 billion — more than twice the $534 million figure from 2019 — Coinbase ended the year with a net income of $322.3 million.

When its profitability is combined with its massive 43-million-strong user base it isn’t surprising that its major investors believe Coinbase’s IPO could top the $100 billion mark.

What’s Unique About Coinbase’s IPO?

There are a few unusual elements to the Coinbase story starting with the fact that it’s the first company of its kind to hit the stock market.

Other companies provide similar services but Coinbase stands out because it is the entry point into crypto for people all over the world. As such it is perfectly poised to succeed as a publicly traded company.

Further the Coinbase IPO is not a true initial public offering in that it is taking the less traditional route of direct listing on the Nasdaq. By doing so it circumvents the expensive relationship with investment banks that help sell shares of a new stock during an IPO. Additionally Coinbase stays true to its brand of decentralization by leveraging its popularity (and financial records) as a selling point.

What To Consider Before Investing In Coinbase

So should you invest in Coinbase’s IPO?

Investing in any stock comes with an inherent risk so you’ll have to rely on your risk tolerance your motivation for action and your own evaluation of the company’s prospects.

That said there are many who believe that the company’s strong financial performance in recent years combined with the growing popularity of cryptocurrency as a whole suggests that Coinbase is positioned to perform quite well as a publicly traded company. This should translate to a strong performance on the stock market.

Many see investing in Coinbase as a way to take advantage of the popularity of cryptocurrency without investing directly. At the same time that link to cryptocurrency means that there are factors to consider that are out of Coinbase’s control. Investors may still want to educate themselves on crypto news including the coins available via Coinbase and overall cryptocurrency performance.

Whatever you decide the upcoming release of COIN on the stock market promises to be a historic and exciting event in the financial space. If you choose to invest remember to set your budget and expectations ahead of time. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.

During a conversation with writer and filmmaker Justine Bateman Moss revealed that she was offered a grandmother role ""the day after my 40th birthday"" according to The Hollywood Reporter.

""I had heard that at 40 everything changed. I didn't believe in that because I don't believe in just jumping on a thought system that I don't really align with"" she said. ""But literally the day after my 40th birthday I was reading a script that had come to me and I was talking to my manager about it. She was like 'Oh no no no it's not that role [you're reading for] it's the grandmother.' I may be exaggerating a bit but it happened overnight. I went from being a girl to the mother to beyond the mother.""

Moss now 53 said it was ""brutal"" swallowing that reality especially as older male actors don't face the same hurdles.

""You don't feel like you've aged much and suddenly you're seeing yourself on screen"" she said. ""I would look at these French and European actresses and they just had something about them that felt so confident in their own skin. I couldn't wait to be that. I strive for that. It's not easy being in this business. There's a lot of external pressure.""

The celebrated actress who also appeared in Jessica Jones will be reprising her role as Trinity in The Matrix 4 moderated a conversation on behalf of New York's 92nd Street Y about Bateman's new book. Face: One Square Foot of Skin explores society's response to women as they age and is a follow-up to Bateman's 2018 book Fame: The Hijacking of Reality.

During the chat Bateman said she felt it was ""psychotic"" that conversations about aging turn into discussions about ""cutting up our faces.""

""It's become normalized"" she said about cosmetic surgery. ""Time out time out! This is not a fact. This is an idea that we can either pull in and make a belief or not. I'm like f--k that.""

In the face of criticism about her looks Bateman 55 said she's not about to bend her philosophy. Instead she chooses to look inward and heal her own insecurities rather than responding to hate.

""It does nothing to make me happier or free. It does everything to tamp all that down. It does everything to mute my life. I'm going to do the opposite then I'll have the opposite result"" Bateman said.

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term performance of a company's stock. The faster a company is growing the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Infineon Technologies AG is 2.8% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in Semiconductors industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -3.5% which ranks worse than 72% of the companies in Semiconductors industry.

Another way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months Infineon Technologies AG's return on invested capital is 4.07 and its cost of capital is 7.33. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Infineon Technologies AG is shown below:

Pediatric patients under the care of Dr. Elizabeth Stephens may wake up from surgery with art on their chest. It all started when she spontaneously surprised Dalton Hinman with a drawing of a bulldog on his bandage when he awoke from surgery. There's a story behind that.

This article is written by Mayo Clinic Staff.

Creating a connection with a child undergoing surgery can be a momentous task for any physician. For Dr. Elizabeth Stephens a pediatric and congenital cardiac surgeon the key is a fine-tipped Sharpie. With a few quick pen strokes Dr. Stephens delights her young patients with artwork on their bandages.

Art premiere with a bulldog

""Whoa that is cool"" Kayla Hinman remembers her son Dalton saying after he saw the bulldog Dr. Stephens had drawn on his chest bandage.

Dalton who is 8 had just woken from the first of two surgeries he had at Mayo Clinic in Rochester last year. In October Dr. Stephens repaired Dalton's pulmonary arteries and replaced his pulmonary valve. In December she also fixed Dalton's coarctation a congenital narrowing of the aorta.

""Dr. Stephens did an amazing job explaining what the surgical plan was and answered all our questions"" Kayla says.

And Dr. Stephens had questions of her own. Important ones. She asked Dalton about his favorite things and soon the conversation turned to the Bulldogs his grade school basketball team back home in South Dakota.

""He was wearing his team T-shirt to his clinic visit"" Dr. Stephens says. ""At the end of the case I asked the nurse if she had a Sharpie and I looked up a bulldog image on my phone and drew it on the bandage labeled 'Dalton star of the bulldogs.'""

Kayla says she had no idea Dr. Stephens drew the design.

""It was a long wait to see Dalton after surgery so coming into his room that was the first thing we saw. It was so special"" Kayla says.

Watch the video above to learn more about Dr. Stephens' unique artwork.

Art by request

That spontaneous decision to draw the bulldog kicked off a new habit for Dr. Stephens who now routinely quizzes her young patients about their favorite things to come up with ideas for a bandage design. That has led to many more creations. She has drawn a lumberjack dolphin cat frog Winnie the Pooh the Minnesota Vikings logo and many other images.



Support from the care team

Dr. Stephens' operating room colleagues loved what they saw and became happy enablers.

""My operating room nurse surprised me one day with a bag of colored thin-tipped Sharpies but as the ideas grew there were some colors missing"" Dr. Stephens recalls. ""I was trying to draw a cute reindeer around Christmastime and there wasn't any brown so I tried to mix the colors. Then for Christmas my team gave me the ultimate box of colored Sharpies and I am set for life.""

I do heart surgery because it's my calling and I love the privilege of taking care of kids. Elizabeth Stephens M.D. Ph.D.

To make sure the beautified bandages can turn into a keepsake for families Dr. Stephens now draws her images on extra bandages that are placed atop the real ones.

""The parents see them when they first see their child in the ICU. For the kids we have to take a photo and show it to them because the bandages are on their chest"" Dr. Stephens says.

Meaningful care

Kids and their families aren't the only ones benefitting from Dr. Stephens' creative touch. It helps her too. She says creating art on bandages is a way to de-stress after a case.

""I do heart surgery because it's my calling and I love the privilege of taking care of kids. But the parents and their kids don't get to see the art of what I do to fix hearts on the inside. They only see a scar but this way they also have something beautiful on the outside"" she says.

Dalton received a second dose of Dr. Stephens' art when he requested a John Deere tractor to decorate his bandage after his second surgery.

It's that extra care that makes his mother so grateful for her son's journey at Mayo Clinic.

""I have never met such a humble surgeon. Dr. Stephens is so genuine and this drawing was proof that she cares about the little things. Dalton really enjoyed talking with her and she took the time to explain what she had done. That meant so much to all of us"" Kayla says.

Dr. Stephens says she isn't often in the room when families see her designs for the first time but her drawings show how much she and everyone at Mayo care about them and their child.

""This is just a little token of that"" she says.

DAL,Delta Air Lines,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kZWx0YS1haXJsaW5lcy1yZXBvcnQtbG9zcy0yMDIxLTA4NDMwMzk2OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Airlines to Report Loss in 2021 Unless There is Significant Recovery in Traffic: Cowen,"Cowen and company in their latest report said they continue to believe that Delta Airlines will report a loss this year unless there is a significant recovery of international and corporate traffic in the second half which seems highly unlikely amid the fourth wave of coronavirus infections.

The Airline company which provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the United States and across the world is expected to report its first-quarter earnings on Thursday April 15.

Delta Airlines would report a loss for the fifth consecutive time of $2.84 in the first quarter of 2021 as the airlines continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and renewed travel restrictions. That would represent a year-over-year decline of over 450% from -$0.51 per share seen in the same quarter a year ago.

The Atlanta-based airline’s revenue would decline more than 50% to around $3.9 billion.

In 2020 Delta Airlines reported a full-year loss for the first time in 11 years as COVID-19 travel restrictions significantly dented air travel demand but CEO Ed Bastian said he expects 2021 to be the year of recovery.

Delta Airlines’ shares which slumped more than 40% last year rose about 22% to $49.27 on Friday.

“We are reiterating our Market Perform rating on the common shares of Delta Air Lines. We are increasing our price target to $53 from $44 which is based on 8.2x 2023E EPS. These shares are currently selling at ~8.2x the 2023 consensus EPS estimate a discount to peers with higher exposure to domestic leisure traffic and a slight premium to its own historical trading range. The shares are ~20% below their pre-pandemic highs but 2021 revenues are forecast to be ~42% below 2019 levels suggesting these shares may take a break before heading higher” noted Helane Becker Cowen and Company.

“We do not expect revenues to get back to 2019 levels until 2023 at the earliest. Exposure to corporate and international travel will continue to weigh on near-term results. Jet fuel pricing has recovered faster than anticipated weighing on bottom-line forecasts in the near-term vs previous estimates. We continue to expect Delta will not recover revenue to pre-pandemic levels before 2023 unless corporate and international traffic recovers sooner than anticipated.”

Delta Airlines Stock Price Forecast

Seventeen analysts who offered stock ratings for Delta Airlines in the last three months forecast the average price in 12 months of $53.94 with a high forecast of $72.00 and a low forecast of $42.00.

The average price target represents a 9.48% increase from the last price of $49.27. Of those 17 analysts ten rated “Buy” seven rated “Hold” while none rated “Sell” according to Tipranks.

Story continues

Morgan Stanley gave the base target price of $72 with a high of $96 under a bull scenario and $35 under the worst-case scenario. The firm gave an “Overweight” rating on the airlines’ stock.

“We remain Overweight Delta Airlines (DAL) and are raising our price target from $55 to $72. DAL remains our top Legacy airline pick. We believe DAL’s strong franchise/customer loyalty and historical margin superiority can continue on the other side of the pandemic. On the other hand DAL cannot wave away Legacy challenges including delayed corporate/international travel and increased pressure on the balance sheet”

“Nevertheless we believe DAL is well positioned for the recovery as we see it – our estimates are 39% above consensus for FY22 and 49% for FY23. Our DCF-backed PT of $72 is about 20% above where the stock was trading in 2018-19 with a 2023 estimated EPS about 20% higher than 2019 as well.”

Several other analysts have also updated their stock outlook. Evercore ISI raised their price objective to $55 from $51 and gave the stock an overweight rating. Jefferies Financial Group raised their price objective to $50 from $40 and gave the stock a hold rating. Susquehanna Bancshares cut shares of Delta Air Lines from a positive rating to a neutral rating and raised their price objective to $45 from $42.

Inspiration is easy in travel but squaring inspiration with the reality of money or miles balances can be more difficult. Delta has rolled out a fantastic new tool which allows you to explore the world at a budget you set with miles or cash.

Google Flights may have come up with the idea first but by adding points prices too Delta has taken it to new heights. Here’s the new Delta website feature you’ve got to play around with which should only get better with time…

Delta’s Destination Finder

Want to filter by price travel restrictions or whether bars are open? You can. And unlike most airline websites which look like they run on Windows 95 Delta has a fully interactive map showing you visually all the places your cash or points can take you.

Delta’s new interactive destination finder allows you to filter by maximum budget using points or cash. This is always a fascinating way to see that far off destinations like Israel or Portugal may only be marginally more expensive or in some cases cheaper than domestic travel!

Being able to see points prices helps give a ballpark of where Delta Skymiles can take you.

You just slide the sliders to customize what you want to see or what’s in your budget and the map does the rest. It’s always worth zooming in and zooming out to see all that exists. It’s awesome.

For each destination you can see the four main things travelers want to know including quarantine test proof forms or insurance.

Awesome Destination Filters

Travel entry restrictions such as vaccination or testing requirements at the destination are going to factor into most decisions for at least a year to come and this new Delta tool takes that into account too.

You can even filter things like “only destinations with museums open” or only places where “non-essential shops are open”. The map pulls the latest data from both local and regional US domestic cities as well as destinations further afield.

How Delta’s Destination Tool Works

The first step is entering your starting point. Once that’s in a list of all the lowest prices using points or cash will pop up on the map and you can begin to filter further using your own preferences.

Setting New York LaGuardia as a starting point I was instantly presented with a variety of US destinations available for under $100 round trip using cash or fewer than 10000 points using Delta SkyMiles. I’m now considering some destinations that I’d completely zoned out unintentionally.

Unfortunately there’s just one drawback with Delta’s new destination tool: it doesn’t allow you to filter for Delta One Business Class or Premium Select. For now the tool is exclusively for economy cabin bookings with points or cash. That’s absolutely expected to change over time.

It’ll certainly help people get value from the limited time 90000 Point Delta Skymiles Amex bonuses!

This is a really cool and smart tool from Delta which draws upon things people love from Google Flights and helps massively with travel inspiration both near and far. Sure if you’re traveling purely on price Google Flights has almost the same eact inspiration tool and will show other airline prices too but if you’re a Delta loyalist or want to use points this makes things even easier.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmMuY29tL2phc29uLWF0ZW4vYWZ0ZXItMzAteWVhcnMtZGVsdGEtaXMtbWFraW5nLWEtYmlnLWNoYW5nZS10by1pdHMtc2t5bWlsZXMtcHJvZ3JhbS1pdHMtc29tZXRoaW5nLW5vLWFpcmxpbmUtaGFzLWV2ZXItZG9uZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After 30 Years Delta Is Making a Big Change to Its SkyMiles Program and It's Something No Airline Has Ever Done,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/after-30-years-delta-is-making-a-big-change-to-its-skymiles-program-its-something-no-airline-has-ever-done.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmMuY29tL2phc29uLWF0ZW4vYWZ0ZXItMzAteWVhcnMtZGVsdGEtaXMtbWFraW5nLWEtYmlnLWNoYW5nZS10by1pdHMtc2t5bWlsZXMtcHJvZ3JhbS1pdHMtc29tZXRoaW5nLW5vLWFpcmxpbmUtaGFzLWV2ZXItZG9uZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9uZXh0LXdlZWstZGVsdGEtc3RhcnRzLXNlcnZpbmctY29ja3RhaWxzLWluLWEtY2FuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Next Week Delta Starts Serving Cocktails In A Can,"On Tuesday Delta Air Lines teased new on board snack and drink options. Goldfish crackers seem to be in the offing and it looks like the beloved Biscoff cookies are back. Delta is is known for those and even crowned a passenger ‘Biscoff Queen’.

Coming soon to a plane near you… can you guess the options shown here? 👀 pic.twitter.com/fAvW29tQZI — Delta (@Delta) April 6 2021

What struck me though is the introduction of Tip Top cocktails. It was odd these were blurred on twitter because the airline shared the news earlier that these small canned cocktails would become available on domestic and short international flights starting April 14.

The two featured below are a canned margarita and a canned old fashioned which is what Delta will offer initially. Other offerings include negroni manhattan daiquiri and bee’s knees which I’m not familiar with.

These will be available in first class and don’t appear as though they will permanently replace spirits but will be additive. (Delta hasn’t been serving liquor up front domestically during the pandemic.)

Those looking for an adult beverage may be inclined to try a premium pre-prepared and canned old-fashioned or margarita from Atlanta-based Tip Top Proper Cocktails. The Tip Top margarita which will make its world debut on Delta flights packs a punch with flavors of juicy salted lime vegetal tequila notes and fresh orange rind; the classic old-fashioned delivers vanilla sweet citrus caramel and spice.

United Airlines sells the pre-mixed Knob Creek Old Fashioned by On The Rocks Cocktails ($12) but I think what’s striking here is the can.

The packaging feels low-end and is reminiscent of when Spirit Airlines used to sell wine in a can.

Indeed the company supplying them calls themselves Tip Top and if you have to claim quality in your brand name I suspect you’re trying too hard."

The commodity trading of our ancestors eventually gave way to money which in the past few thousand years has cycled through different forms from wampum beads and metal to paper. In the 21st century it often manifests as intangible electronic transfers and even cryptocurrencies.

Money is one of humanity’s most momentous inventions. For millennia it's made the world go round and that’s no new sentiment: As the Latin writer Publilius Syrus put it in the first century B.C. “Money alone sets all the world in motion.” But what is this shape-shifting source of prosperity anyway? For Americans the word calls to mind pennies nickels dimes quarters and dollars. Of course these constitute the currency of just one nation at one moment in time. The United Nations recognizes another 179 current world currencies and hundreds or thousands more have long since gone the way of the shilling.

Besides money is far more complex than the bills and coins we carry in our purses and wallets. Formal definitions typically note that it serves many purposes: a convenient unit of exchange a way to store wealth long-term and a standardized measurement of value. This list only scratches the surface of money's uses.

The physicality of money might be its least important property. In fact most economists agree it doesn’t even need a physical form especially in the modern age. David Orrell and Roman Chlupatý in The Evolution of Money write that “The concept of currency has become increasingly abstract to the point where actual coins and notes form only a small portion of the money in existence.” That however is the end of the story — at least so far. Let’s turn to the beginning.

The Birth of Money

Most thinkers on the subject from Aristotle to today’s mainstream economists have speculated that money emerged from a prehistoric barter economy in which people traded goods and services directly.

Such a system requires that both parties want what the other has to offer and that they can settle on the relative value of each item. Do 30 bananas equate to one fishing net? Three nets to an ox? Money on the other hand is what everyone wants and it is the unit by which all else is measured. That means I can sell my bananas to someone else for money the economical common denominator and use it to buy your ox.

Money also frees us from lugging around our wealth in all its cumbersome bulk. Imagine wheeling a bushel of barley into the coffee shop to pay for your latte. How many goats might it take to rent a SoHo studio? Certainly more than you can keep in 800 square feet. Ancient societies obviously weren’t this complex but as they grew the economist Glyn Davies writes in The History of Money “the demands of trade exceeded the scope of barter.” Money came to the rescue.

Just about anything can serve as money so long as it's durable and scarce. Throughout much of Asia and Africa cowry shells — the spent homes of sea snails small and large — did the job well into modern times. On the Micronesian island of Yap enormous donut-shaped limestones famously fulfilled the role of currency despite being immobile. In other cases the best option was some kind of “commodity money” like cattle salt or grain which has intrinsic value agreed upon by most everyone in a given society.

Lumps of precious metals like gold and silver are commodities too with the added benefit of malleability. The first uniform metal money dates to China’s Zhou Dynasty which forged tiny replicas to represent cowry shells along with knives spades and other tools. But the first coins we would recognize as such were minted in Lydia a kingdom in present-day Turkey during the 7th century B.C. Its last king with his legendary wealth lives on in the expression “rich as Croesus.”

Banking and the Gold Standard

Coinage was far easier to transport and value — as opposed to weighing crude bits of metal — and it soon spread throughout the Greek city states and beyond. In the meantime though back in China an even more convenient method was evolving.

Instead of constantly moving coins from place to place the Chinese government kept the coins all in one place and issued pieces of paper in their stead. This was the start of representative money in which the money objects themselves are not valuable. From his travels in the East Marco Polo brought this concept back to Europe where it gave rise to banking.

First in Italy and later in England people began to deposit their bullion with goldsmiths and notaries which effectively acted as what we now call banks. Those establishments gave receipts for the deposits and over time the receipts became a currency unto themselves — though they could always be redeemed for actual coins people just as often circulated the banknotes as payments in their own right.

In this arrangement the representative paper money is still backed by commodity money in the form of precious materials. Centuries later gold and silver still remain the most universal symbols of wealth. To this day the U.S. government stores roughly 5000 tons of gold at Fort Knox. A few hundred miles east the Federal Reserve Bank of New York guards the world’s largest depository of gold — 6190 tons owned by clients around the world as of 2019 — in a vault 80 feet beneath the streets of Manhattan.

The Gold Standard dominated international economics for centuries tying the value of currencies to the value of the rare yellow metal. But in the past hundred years governments have decoupled the two. The norm now is fiat money which has no intrinsic value and is not backed by anything that does. You cannot walk to the bank hand over a stack of hundred-dollar bills and ask for a troy ounce of gold. These slips of paper are valuable only because the government says they are and only so long as the citizens have faith in their government.

Wealth on the Web

Even hard currency is getting harder to come by. As Orrell and Chlupatý write we are now “in a virtual regime where most money is created at the whim of private banks simply by entering a number into a computer account.” Today cash incarnate rarely needs to change hands. For decades credit cards have allowed bits and bytes to stand in for greenbacks and in the past few years cryptocurrencies have sparked what may be the next financial revolution.

Bitcoin — the best known in a growing constellation of cryptocurrencies — is an increasingly popular virtual money created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group known only as Satoshi Nakamoto. Even more abstract than digital dollars it is simply a series of balances in a decentralized online ledger known as a blockchain. There are no physical bitcoins.

Using what's called peer-to-peer technology cryptocurrencies remove middlemen like banks and the government allowing direct transactions between a vast community of users. Because so many people are independently keeping track of the transactions it is all but impossible for anyone to cheat. This format removes the problem of trusting millions of people — you need only trust the system.

Economists still debate to what extent cryptocurrencies will change the world and whether for better or worse. But the digital transformation of currency in general is well underway with far-reaching implications. Money’s migration into cyberspace means that it is “no longer tethered to the fortunes of one government or a single country” as the cultural anthropologist Jack Weatherford wrote in 1997. “The newly emerging system will change the very meaning of money.” Perhaps in a century cash will seem as antiquated as cowry shells.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2hlYWx0aC10ZWNoLWFsZXJ0LXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktdG8tZGlzY292ZXItYW5kLXRyZWF0LXNraW4tZGlzZWFzZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Health Tech Alert: Technology to discover and treat Skin Diseases,Electronic Health Reporter mentioned that in a recent article published in Advanced Materials a team revealed how a low-cost 3D printer was altered to allow it to adjust small movements of the body during the process of printing.

Mayor Joe Barger has announced a joint Family Dollar/Dollar Tree is planned for a currently vacant space on Alabama Highway 216 across from the town park.

“This will offer our citizens a great opportunity to shop local for pantry items crafts gifts and household products” Barger said. “We are excited that the Family Dollar/Dollar Tree Corp. chose Brookwood for one of their new store locations.""

Barger said construction of the proposed 10500-square-foot building is expected to start in the next two to three months and open in January 2022.

The new store is slated to have freezer section but it will not have a fresh meat department or produce Barger said.

“Here we grow” Barger said.

In July 2015 Dollar Tree Inc. announced the acquisition of Family Dollar Stores Inc. to form a joint company of discount retailers.

The company’s first combination store opened four years later in late 2019 two additional test stores in early 2020 according to a corporate earnings update.

These stores proved a learning ground that through analysis of store performance and customer feedback led to refinements of the concept and between July and the end of December 2020 the company opened 32 additional combination stores including one in nearby Linden and is currently operating almost 50 nationwide.

The stores are aimed at small towns and rural communities with populations of 3000 to 4000 and in a promotional video officials said 3000 markets for them have been identified.

These are markets like Brookwood where Barger said the combination store would be about 25% Family Dollar and 75% Dollar Tree while employing up to 15 people.

“We are extremely pleased with our customers’ response to the new combination store concept” said Michael Witynski president and CEO of Dollar Tree in the corporate earnings report. “As I have said in the past we will continue to refine our strategic store formats so that we are able to better serve customers while improving store productivity margins and returns.

“We want formats that leverage the best of the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands to serve customers in all types of geographic markets. We believe we can continue to change evolve and improve.”

Some discount stores in particular have failed to take basic actions to protect consumer health according to a new report entitled ""Who's Minding the Store? A Report Card on Retailer Actions to Eliminate Toxic Chemicals."" The findings which have been disseminated annually for the past five years were released last week. For the third year in a row the California-based 99 Cents Only Stores received a failing grade while other discount retailers such as Dollar Tree and Dollar General improved their below-average standing. While the discount sector was considered the ""most improved"" retail sector overall many stores are still failing to move aggressively to protect consumers.

""In many of our communities we are already overburdened by multiple exposures to toxics be it the production of toxic chemicals or the refining of fossil fuels that are made into chemicals that are put in products and then come back into the waste stream into our communities as well"" said José Bravo a contributor to the report who is also the national coordinator for the Campaign for Healthier Solutions which co-published the report along with the Mind the Store campaign. Both initiatives were launched to advocate that retailers phase out chemicals like Bisphenol A phthalates and the so-called ""forever chemicals"" known as PFAs from their products and packaging. Since their first report card they have found that almost 70 percent of companies surveyed have improved their chemical safety programs. This year fifty retailers representing over 200000 North American stores were surveyed.

Many discount retail stores known as dollar stores are located in predominantly low-income areas and communities of color where residents are disproportionately exposed to chemical hazards because of their proximity to hazardous industrial facilities that produce toxic chemicals. These chemicals are in turn used to create household products like laundry detergent which are then sold back to these same communities by discount retailers. In some communities dollar stores are the only source for household essentials such as food and cleaning products. In 2015 the Campaign for Healthier Solutions found that these stores' products contain toxic chemicals that can cause cancer birth defects and other health and developmental issues.

""During this COVID year dollar stores have made banner profits"" said Bravo. ""They should be doing much much more.""

In Southwestern Louisiana Christine Bennett and her husband Delma Bennett have for decades battled the chemical industry's intrusion into their once bucolic village of Mossville an unincorporated hamlet founded by former slaves near Lake Charles. The toxic pollution from sources like petroleum refineries and vinyl chloride manufacturers has driven out many of Mossville's longtime residents — including the Bennetts who moved to Lake Charles to protect Christine's failing health. However the couple kept their house and lawn service business in the hamlet and they've continued to raise awareness about the dangers of the chemicals polluting the environment and its residents through the organization Concerned Citizens of Mossville.

Two years ago Christine and her granddaughter protested with posters in front of a dollar store in Lake Charles to help inform consumers about the dangers in products containing toxic chemicals as well as the pollution created by more than a dozen industrial facilities that surround Mossville. But the Bennetts made little headway according to Delma because many residents simply can't afford to shop elsewhere. ""Nobody paid attention"" said Delma 77. ""The general public is not aware. They are not aware of the danger that we're under.""

Christine recalled taking a tour of one of the chemical plants as a teenager and learning how toxic chemicals are used to make soap and laundry detergent. When it comes to convincing others of the harmful consequences of producing toxic chemicals and failing to remove them from existing products she recognizes it's an uphill battle.

""How would you make a living if these places weren't open? Well we've got to show them how you can make a living"" Christine said. ""We've got to show them there's a better way to do it than to put out all of these chemicals.""

Most recently the chemical giant Sasol has been in the process of expanding its petrochemical plant in Mossville in part through the construction of a massive natural gas processing facility known as an ethane cracker. To do so the company has offered buyouts to the remaining Mossville residents. While the Bennetts said they'll likely take the buyout they want to ensure that they and others are ""made whole"" and receive the type of compensation that will allow them to relocate to a healthy environment. They long for what Mossville was like in its early farming days when people grew vegetables in their gardens raised livestock and drank clean water from wells they dug themselves. The hamlet was once filled with the sound of crickets and owls Christine said and lightning bugs were so plentiful that she could easily capture them in her hands. That changed as the factories proliferated.

""It's like we're in a desert in Mossville now"" said Christine. ""We have no oxygen to breathe but the bad air.""

Creating policies that address the entire life cycle of chemical products is a priority for environmental justice advocates; Bravo calls it a ""cradle-to-cradle"" approach. So while applauding the steps taken by retailers to improve their practices — 64 percent reported notable progress in their chemical use or policies since 2019 — last week's report found that others failed to demonstrate ""meaningful progress."" For example while some discount retailers have taken steps to identify toxic chemicals and create plans to replace them with safer alternatives the report found that the 99 Cents Only Stores company ""has done nothing.""

""We cannot stand by knowing that stores in our neighborhoods are selling products that are dangerous to our families"" Elizabeth Martinez a community organizer with Lideres Campesinas a California-based network of women farmworker leaders said in a statement. ""We will continue to hold these retail chains publicly accountable until we know that the products in these stores are safe.""

The Campaign for Healthier Solutions said that although 99 Cents Only Stores met with members of the initiative and committed to further discussions the discount retailer did not follow through. Last week the campaign urged the company to develop a safer chemicals policy set goals with clear timelines for reducing and eliminating chemicals of high concern and eliminate toxic additives in food packaging as well as chemicals in food and food contact materials in its supply chain. According to the retailer's website it operates 391 stores across four states in the Western U.S.

Representatives from 99 Cents Only Stores did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.

The Campaign for Healthier Solutions analyzed products sold in dollar stores across the country in 2015 and found that 81 percent of more than 150 products tested contained at least one hazardous chemical at concerning levels. Some of the chemical ingredients in these products have included toxic metals such as lead which has irreversible effects on a child's developing brain and can lead to cognitive deficits behavioral issues and educational delays. The tests also found phthalates which have been linked to cancer birth defects learning disabilities reduced fertility and other health issues.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL2FsbG9uZ2VvcmdpYS5jb20vbmF0aW9uYWwtbmV3cy9saW1pdGVkLWVkaXRpb24tcHJpbmdsZXMtZmxhdm9yLXBhY2tzLXRoZS1kaWxsLWljaW91cy16ZXN0LW9mLWRlZXAtZnJpZWQtcGlja2xlcy1pbnRvLW9uZS1jcnVuY2h5LWJpdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Limited-Edition Pringles Flavor Packs The Dill-icious Zest Of Deep-Fried Pickles Into One Crunchy Bite,"The Kellogg Company has announced a new limited-time flavor of Pringles Wavy Deep Fried Pickle available at Dollar General beginning this month.

Longtime conflicts with the fishing industry remain as well as some landowners but with the help of a major push from the Biden administration offshore wind may finally advance in the Atlantic.

Dominion Energy Virginia’s state utility plans to install nearly 200 more ocean turbines east of Cape Henry over the next five years. And developers have permits pending for 10 more offshore wind projects along the East Coast from North Carolina to Maine.

The Biden administration wants to buoy the industry. Last month the administration announced a $3 billion plan to expand offshore wind.

The ambitious goal is to generate 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power by the end of the decade enough to power more than 10 million homes and cut 78 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. That’s roughly the carbon equivalent of taking 17 million cars off the road for a year.

Offshore wind represents an opportunity for the Biden administration to address two major goals: reducing carbon emissions and creating jobs.

“Nowhere is the scale of that opportunity clearer than for offshore wind” National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy said in announcing the new plan.

The projects could support tens of thousands of jobs from maintenance at sea to steel production far inland.

There is just one other offshore wind project currently online in the United States: five turbines in state waters off the coast of Block Island R.I.

The industry has more proposals in the works including:

A research project floating turbine in Maine;

North Carolina’s Kitty Hawk Wind Energy Area 27 miles off the coast of the Outer Banks;

US Wind Maryland a 270 megawatt farm planned 17 miles offshore from Ocean City.

“This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity …” said Laura Morton of the American Clean Power Association an industry group. “We can provide clean energy slash carbon emissions and create jobs.”

‘It is unprecedented’

The administration’s announcement represents a significant turning point for the nascent offshore wind industry.

Representatives from the White House and four federal agencies — Interior Commerce Transportation and Energy — rolled out programs to support offshore wind.

Among other things the administration said it would speed permits for projects along the East Coast invest in research and development offer federal loan guarantees for offshore wind development and invest in port improvements around the country to make it easier to build new offshore wind facilities.

“It is unprecedented and shows a recognition of how complex offshore wind is and that it takes a lot of pieces to come together to make it work” said Catherine Bowes program director for offshore wind for the National Wildlife Federation.

The National Wildlife Federation like many other environmental groups supports offshore wind for its unique potential to provide massive amounts of clean power.

“We truly don’t believe that we can meet the climate and energy goals that both people and wildlife need without responsible offshore wind” Bowes said.

Europe erected the first offshore wind turbines 20 years ago and is the world leader in offshore wind. The industry has been slower to get off the ground in the United States where it has faced regulatory hurdles and opposition from the fishing industry and some onshore landowners.

The first attempt at offshore wind in the United States was mired in conflict.

Developers gave up on the Cape Wind project in 2017 after multiple lawsuits and years of back-and-forth on permitting and plans. The project in tony Nantucket Sound off Massachusetts met opposition from high-profile homeowners nearby including members of the Kennedy family and businessman William Koch a rare alliance.

The Obama administration promoted offshore wind as part of its climate plan but did not coordinate programs among agencies to support the industry. Many pending permits sat in the doldrums during the Trump administration which did not prioritize renewable energy.

Biden administration officials say they will expedite the regulatory process. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management committed to review at least 16 construction and operations plans for pending projects by 2025 and advance new lease sales.

Shift in the political winds

Several key factors make offshore wind more viable now than ever before.

The development of bigger more efficient turbines means offshore wind can produce more energy at lower prices. New technology also allows for development farther offshore capitalizing on stronger winds and reducing some of the conflicts with coastal communities and wildlife.

And states are increasingly looking offshore as an economic and environmental windfall.

Last fall the governors of Maryland Virginia and North Carolina signed a joint memorandum of understanding to work together as a three-state hub for offshore wind energy — an attempt to create an attractive environment for business investment and compete with the Northeast’s market.

In North Carolina the state’s Department of Commerce commissioned a report released in March that said the state’s manufacturers could profit from the “rapidly developing market” for offshore wind. The analysis estimated a $100 billion market for development and construction alone.

The existing projects in the United States have partly relied on European ships and manufacturers. But as the industry grows it could spur manufacturing that stretches into America’s heartland.

For example Virginia’s Dominion Energy is building the first U.S.-made vessel to install offshore wind turbines. Domestic steel operations in Alabama and West Virginia are shipping steel to a Texas shipyard to build the vessel.

Worries about marine life fishing

But offshore wind has not yet resolved conflicts with the longest-standing industry of the sea: fishing.

As state and federal leaders push for more offshore development fishing groups have concerns with both the process and the implementation.

They are worried the projects could affect marine life. And they argue regulators have not included them in a meaningful way when developing plans — especially because one offshore wind project can affect fishing for boats that might not be based at ports nearby.

“We need to mitigate impacts to fishing and essentially fishing concerns have been completely ignored. We are still in the exact same place asking for the things we have been asking for the last 10 years” said Annie Hawkins executive director of the Responsible Offshore Development Alliance a broad coalition of fishing groups from all over the U.S.

For example the captains from five boats that fish for black sea bass and conch sent a letter to Dominion Energy asking the company to limit construction during certain times that are key for the fishery collect more baseline data and commit to compensation when fishing is closed.

Nowhere is the conflict more pronounced than in Maine where fishing and lobster boats circled around a proposed research area in protest in March.

Gov. Janet Mills has tried to walk the line on the issue. She is counting on offshore wind to help Maine meet climate mitigation goals. But in response to the pushback she proposed a 10-year moratorium on wind projects in state waters in January. She still supports projects in federal waters further offshore.

Supporters of the industry say it is possible to design projects with consideration for fishing interests.

“By far the biggest threat to ocean life is climate change and the trajectory we are on now is almost inconceivably damaging to the ocean” said Miriam Goldstein director of Ocean Policy at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress.

“The wind resources off the coast and near population centers — that is an opportunity I don’t believe we can overlook. Deploying that in a smart way with fishermen at the table is among the most important things we can do to address the climate emergency.”

Congressional action

Congress is also getting in on the action. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill introduced three different offshore wind bills this year.

Offshore wind is part of large green energy tax incentive legislation from Democrats. Another more targeted offshore wind proposal would create career training grants for colleges or labor organization.

Rep. Elaine Luria D-Va. whose Hampton Roads district could see new jobs and development from Dominion’s offshore project also announced the creation of a Congressional Offshore Wind Caucus last month.

“Increasing offshore wind production so that we can create high-paying clean energy jobs and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels shouldn’t be a partisan issue” Luria said in an email this week. “Offshore wind is critical to strengthening our economy and improving the environment.”",,,,,,,,,

A Domino’s customer in Minnesota allegedly threatened workers with a gun over a dispute about pizza toppings. Apparently the customer wanted to get the toppings on the side and the pizzeria was unable to do so.

The incident occurred at a Domino’s in Rochester Minn. last Sunday My Fox 47 reports. Apparently the customer had requested his pizza with toppings on the side and was told that the restaurant couldn’t do that.

The suspect identified by the news outlet as 34-year-old Victor Fortner allegedly drove up to the restaurant’s drive-thru and began arguing about the toppings. He reportedly threw several pizza slices at the workers in the restaurant.

Great. We a love a freebie right?

It’s not quite that simple. Scores of viewers are torn over whether the resourceful friends are playing the system smartly or just plain stealing.

A clip of them performing the hack which has been viewed more than 3.8 million times shows the pals sitting at their table in the restaurant tupperware in hand.

They then begin piling slices of pizza into the containers as they whisper: “Nobody’s gonna know.”

They then sneak their plunder into plastic bags under the table and a Domino’s server brings them a fresh pizza.

The video ends with the group running down the street laden with bags before celebrating their achievement once they safely reach home.

The clip’s uploader @gurpreet_gillx explained that their nearby Domino’s has “a deal where you get a free pizza every time you finish a pizza.”

“We paid €7.50 each and got four pizzas and refill drinks” she said adding that they “did it right”.

The friends sprinted away triumphantly

The move prompted thousands of comments from fellow TikTokers – some in awe at their ingenuity others questioning the configuration of their moral compass.

“This is every student’s dream” wrote one admirer.

“If I worked at Domino’s I wouldn’t even care cause at the end of the day that doesn’t affect my pocket so I would just pretend I didn’t notice” another said.

Another commented: “Best thing about this is it’s not even stealing.”

However others weren’t so sure.

“I think it is illegal” one sceptic replied.

Another pointed out: “This is stealing. Because it is in house consumption only. Same with an all you can eat buffet. You’re not allowed to bring containers and take it with you.”

“Yeah because a couple of students struggling with money is going to affect a multi billion dollar company” one person retorted.

Other TikTokers were more confused that Domino’s actually has dine-in restaurants.

“Since when was Domino’s a sit-down restaurant?” asked one.

“Must be a US thing” responded another.

While another said: “If only they had this in the UK.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi12aWxsYWdlLmNvbS9lYXRuZ28tYWNxdWlyZXMtZG9taW5vcy1waXp6YS1hbmQtY29sZHN0b25lLWZyYW5jaGlzZS1pbi1rZW55YS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eat'N'Go acquires Domino's Pizza and Coldstone franchise in Kenya,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9leHByZXNzLXN1bmRheS1leWUvY2FuLWNsb3RoZXMtaGF2ZS1hLWRvbWluby1lZmZlY3QtNzI2ODEzNi_SAWNodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZXhwcmVzcy1zdW5kYXktZXllL2Nhbi1jbG90aGVzLWhhdmUtYS1kb21pbm8tZWZmZWN0LTcyNjgxMzYvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can clothes have a domino effect?,"At the FDCI Lakmé Fashion Week (LFW) held last month in Mumbai the finale made for a refreshing change of pace. Instead of going with the tried and tested policy of “when in doubt go bling” it opted for the lowkey style statement that Delhi-based designer Ruchika Sachdeva’s label Bodice embodies.

She showcases under the label Bodice which completes a decade this year. Her collection for the phygital (physical-cum-digital) edition of the fashion week — “Ready Set Play” — was a nod to the popular board game Dominoes. The ramp too was modified to look like a board game. “The domino effect is basically a ripple effect where any small action however insignificant sets off a chain of slightly bigger actions — the butterfly effect. During the pandemic I felt a really strong connection with this. Nothing in life happens all of a sudden it’s all a ripple effect. I work with pleats and lines and there’s a lot of symmetry in it. Lines blend into each other hence the ripple effect. When you move the pleats and lines move with you creating that domino effect” says the fashion designer who works out of her studio in Delhi’s Vasant Kunj.

Pleats pintucks billowing pleated sleeves and symmetry dominated Sachdeva’s youthful and peppy showcase at the fashion week. Each of the outfits were painstakingly detailed and handcrafted evoking a richness of luxury without ostentatious embellishments.

Bodice’s clothes will not look out of place at a conference a beachside brunch or even a dressy day at work. “It’s the responsibility of designers like us to celebrate the everyday. Why do we wait for a sangeet or a wedding alone to look nice? Why wait only for the big things? We can celebrate and enjoy the small things. Women don’t want to look beautiful just at a shaadi anymore” says Sachdeva who began her career designing clothes for women in 2011 and then launched a men’s capsule in 2019. “

For centuries men have gotten away wearing light easy-going clothes while women struggle to walk in those heavy lehengas. I am sure that this culture has evolved over time but that’s where we leaders of the industry and culture makers come in — designers painters writers sculptors etc. That’s how movements start like the Modernist movement did.”

Sachdeva shot into the limelight in 2018 when she won the International Woolmark Prize having debuted in the Indian fashion scene as a Lakme Gen Next designer in 2010. Her approach of “slow sustainable fashion” with materials sourced from Bhuttico weavers’ collective in Himachal Pradesh was refreshing.

Today even as high-street fashion brands encourage a consumerist culture talk of sustainability Sachdeva says “Honestly I didn’t use these terms even when I started out. And even now I don’t use them as talking points. I feel it should be in the DNA of any fashion anything to be responsible. To be sustainable or to be slow is nothing special. It’s the most basic human thing. But yes sustainable conscious clothing and slow fashion have become buzzwords. I am glad that people have been pushed to have some clean practices for fashion. If any high street brand does even two per cent it will make a difference” she says.

The conversation turns to kantha the humble running stitch which seems to have a special place in Sachdeva’s heart and oeuvre. “Some grandmothers like to knit; in my family we did kantha. I have some quilts which have been made from old sarees and salwar kameezes of my aunts mother and grandmothers. It’s said that the blessings of our elders are passed down in that tradition. Also kantha enabled the longevity of materials. We come from a culture where we don’t throw things away. This upcycling is being spoken about now but we have practised it for generations. We make 50 units of one design we sell it for maybe Rs 25000 each. We take a month for making that one particular outfit. A woman who has paid for it and is waiting for it for a month will not throw it away after one season” says the 34-year-old."

Text description provided by the architects. In the spirit of creating synergies between the university community the business community the citizens and the ÉTS community the new vocation of the Planetarium commissioned the typology of spaces: spaces to encourage encounters collaboration and reflection linked to tools and advanced technologies spaces of social diversity and exchange platforms for sharing knowledge.

Design approach and architectural challenges

The main architectural challenge met by Menkes Shooner Dagenais LeTourneux Architectes was to find a way to bring light into the heart of this building designed and intended by definition and function to be both obscure and opaque while preserving the memory and the nature of the place inscribed in the imagination of Montrealers.

The choice to develop the project around the concepts of revolution (about an axis) and the circular shape imposed by the intrinsic nature of the building was decisive. Inspired by the perpetual movements of the universe and by the curious complexity of ancient instruments such as the astrolabe or the Orrery machine that translate it the team of architects transformed the former Dow Planetarium not only into a place that allows to see and explains the cosmic movement but into a dynamic place which uses it. The era of observation having gone by this building becomes a generator accelerator and source of inventions.

Beyond the materiality the architects have thus favored the formal language to make the movement and this acceleration real and perceptible: from the gears that recall walls composed of a juxtaposition of vertical slats to the concentric circles which are superimposed in the plan everything is about mechanical rotation and spinning.

The center of the building is an open circular space accessible on all sides and that controls the entire spatial organization of the building. Designed to be the heart of the accelerator in the image of a crucible of innovation and announcing the premises of what will be created in this place it is intended for unplanned encounters and opportunities that are often at the origin of the greatest discoveries.

The mechanics of the rest of the building are entirely articulated around this central space. Similar to the ingenious principle of watchmaking and the cogwheel a concentric circulation path leads to the café the meeting space and the ideation room that wrap around and revolve about a solidary and precise mechanism. Attached to this rotational movement along the main axis of the building spaces intended for businesses that will accompany creators on their journey of technological creation complete this clever device.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zcG9ydC8yMDIxL2Fwci8xMC9pdGFseS1lbmdsYW5kLXdvbWVucy1zaXgtbmF0aW9ucy1ydWdieS11bmlvbi1tYXRjaC1yZXBvcnTSAWdodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vc3BvcnQvMjAyMS9hcHIvMTAvaXRhbHktZW5nbGFuZC13b21lbnMtc2l4LW5hdGlvbnMtcnVnYnktdW5pb24tbWF0Y2gtcmVwb3J0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abby Dow at the double as England thrash Italy in Women’s Six Nations,"England returned to Parma’s Stadio Sergio Lanfranchi the scene of their latest grand slam triumph in November and once more racked up a half-century of points. But unlike in the autumn for an hour this was a real contest. England are on course for a play-off with France to decide this year’s Six Nations but only after the break did they assert their dominance.

Two of England’s nine tries came from their wing Abby Dow – heartwarming moments as she had missed last week’s win over Scotland following the death of her father Paul. The final score was unflattering to Italy with Emily Scarratt converting all but one of those tries.

But the Red Roses have real strength in depth and as the game broke up after the hour mark all their replacements made an instant impact with Zoe Harrison particularly impressive. The Saracens fly-half atoned for breaking Covid protocols something that cost her a starting place against Scotland and her rivalry for the No 10 jersey with Helena Rowland will be interesting.

England’s head coach Simon Middleton said: “I’m absolutely thrilled for Abby. She has shown great strength of character in a difficult time and had tremendous support from her club Wasps.

“We were fantastic in the second half but very very lucky to be ahead at half-time. We weren’t really physical enough before the interval particularly at the breakdown and before the break didn’t create a single chance.”

Middleton made 10 changes to the side that beat Scotland 52-10 in Doncaster with an all-Harlequins front row and their captain Sarah Hunter returning for her first international outing in more than a year. England knew that Italy four of whose players are based in France were going to offer a more physical threat than Scotland. And so it proved.

The game was in its second quarter by the time England got on to the scoreboard. Until then Italy had looked the most dangerous side but when a pass by Michela Sillari went astray Scarratt pounced and ran in the first try from around 50 metres out.

It was cruel on Italy and more ill luck was to follow. Another Italian move broke down and Meg Jones was on hand for a mazy run from inside her own half. The Wasps centre could not quite make it over the line herself but Vicky Fleetwood was on her shoulder to score the second try.

England had got on the wrong side of the French referee Aurélie Groizeleau a week earlier and they did so again when Scarratt was shown a yellow card for a high tackle on Maria Magatti. Sillari converted the resulting penalty although it was soon cancelled out by Rowland’s kick.

The visitors were 14 points ahead by the interval but the score did not reflect the game. After the break Scarratt returned to the field to land a penalty but it was a measure of England’s respect for their opponents that they were opting to take three points once more rather than kick for the corner. After a period of intense English pressure Dow dived over for a try in the corner and was given the benefit of the doubt with the wing appearing to ground the ball just short of the line.

Full-back Eimear Considine and wing Beibhinn Parsons scored two tries each to help secure a bonus point inside the opening 20 minutes with Sene Naoupu running in a fifth before the interval. Wales outclassed 53-0 away to France in their opening Pool B fixture at least managed to stem the flow during the second half. It was not until the 72nd minute that Dorothy Wall added a sixth try for Ireland with Hannah Tyrrell scoring late on to wrap up a comprehensive victory.

Thank you for your feedback.

England then began to empty their bench and turn on the power and the game started to unravel for Italy whose experienced scrum-half Sara Barattin was sent to the sin-bin. One of England’s replacements Harriet Millar-Mills crossed for a try and Rowland then scored for the second successive week after good work by the flanker Alex Matthews.

Dow scored the best try of the afternoon with a run down the touchline from halfway after a smart pass by another replacement Poppy Cleall.

Dow Jones Nasdaq 100 S&P 500 Forecasts for the Week Ahead

US equities enjoyed a modest gain last week as the Dow Jones and S&P 500 creeped deeper into record territory and the Nasdaq 100 looked to make up for lost time as it aims to retake an important trendline. Price action was far from exuberant however as seasonal downtrends in volume and volatility were particularly poignant.

S&P 500 Seasonality Chart

As a result the few gains that were established were done on low volume an occurrence that does not inspire a lot of confidence. Typically a price breakout is most encouraging when it is done on huge trading volume and follow-through is immediate. Nevertheless the fundamental backdrop remains accommodative and the arrival of earnings season might help revive volatility.

Video Explainer – What Rising Treasury Yields Mean for US Equities and Gold

The season is set to begin Wednesday with quarterly reports from some of the country’s largest financial institutions such as Wells Fargo JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. Extra attention may be paid to Goldman Sachs as the bank reportedly escaped from the Archegos family office unraveling without significant losses while others were not so lucky. Should Goldman reveal information to the contrary it could spark broader risk aversion on fears of systemic vulnerabilities.

Aside from concerns surrounding Archegos data from FactSet reveals the season may be one of the best in years in terms of earnings growth. First quarter expectations have shot to 23.8% and since actual results generally outperform expectations slightly corporate earnings growth could be even higher. Considerable growth in earnings could help reign in some valuation metrics many investors have warned are running too hot like price-to-earnings and related measurements.

Either way a string of upbeat quarterly reports could add further fuel to the bullish fire that was ignited after the recent barrage of upbeat economic readings ranging from non-farm payrolls to consumer confidence.

With the economy primed and ready for expansion the Dow Jones Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 appear poised to continue higher although seasonal market trends could slow gains to a crawl. A slow grind higher may become more likely rather than the rapid ascent traders have become accustomed to as markets emerged from the pandemic lows.

Now a special innovation team and a group of nearly 300 newsroom employees are pushing for drastic changes at the paper which has been part of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire since 2007. They say The Journal often Mr. Murdoch’s first read of the day must move away from subjects of interest to established business leaders and widen its scope if it wants to succeed in the years to come. The Journal of the future they say must pay more attention to social media trends and cover racial disparities in health care for example as aggressively as it pursues corporate mergers.

That argument has yet to convince executives in the top ranks of the company.

The Journal got digital publishing right before anyone else. It was one of the few news organizations to charge readers for online access starting in 1996 during the days of dial-up internet. At the time most other publications including The New York Times bought into the mantra that “information wants to be free” and ended up paying dearly for what turned out to be a misguided business strategy.

As thousands of papers across the country folded The Journal with its nearly 1300-person news staff made money thanks to its prescient digital strategy. While that inoculated The Journal against the ravages wrought by an array of unlikely newcomers from Craigslist to Facebook it also kept the paper from innovating further.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8xMC90ZWNoL2FsaWJhYmEtY2hpbmEtcmVjb3JkLWZpbmUvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBQWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjEvMDQvMTAvdGVjaC9hbGliYWJhLWNoaW5hLXJlY29yZC1maW5l?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China hits Alibaba with record $2.8 billion fine for behaving like a monopoly,"London/Hong Kong CNN Business —

China has ordered Alibaba to pay a record fine of 18.2 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) after antitrust regulators concluded that the online shopping giant had been behaving like a monopoly.

Chinese state media reported Saturday that the State Administration for Market Regulation had imposed the penalty following an antitrust investigation into Alibaba’s (BABA) “exclusive dealing agreements” that prevented merchants from selling products on rival e-commerce platforms — a practice known as “choosing one from two.”

The fine is equivalent to 4% of Alibaba’s sales in China in 2019 state news agency Xinhua reported and dwarfs the previous record penalty of $975 million handed out to American chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) in 2015.

Beijing has been tightening the screws on China’s national tech champions in recent months part of a regulatory crackdown that President Xi Jinping has described as one of the country’s top priorities for 2021. Last month Xi urged officials to step up their efforts to regulate online companies to maintain social stability.

Co-founded by legendary entrepreneur Jack Ma Alibaba is one of China’s most prominent and successful private businesses. By making such a high-profile example Chinese regulators are sending a clear message about their intent to rein in the country’s most powerful companies.

Ma has kept a very low profile since Ant Group Alibaba’s financial affiliate was forced to shelve what would have been the world’s biggest IPO last November after he criticized Chinese regulators. Since then Ma has made only one brief public appearance in a video in January and Ant Group — which owns the hugely popular digital payments app Alipay — has been ordered to overhaul its business.

In an open letter published on Saturday Alibaba said the company had cooperated with the investigation and accepted the penalty “with sincerity and will ensure our compliance with determination.”

“Alibaba would not have achieved our growth without sound government regulation and service and the critical oversight tolerance and support from all of our constituencies have been crucial to our development. For this we are full of gratitude and respect” it added. “It is not lost on us that today’s society has new expectations for platform companies as we must assume more responsibilities as part of the nation’s economic and social development.”

Beijing has long been concerned that the influence tech firms have over the financial sector makes that industry vulnerable — Ant for example now commands more than half of the mobile payments market in China — and officials have been looking for ways to rein them in.

Other tech companies could be next in the firing line.

Regulators have questioned executives at Tencent (TCEHY)and Pinduoduo (PDD) punished TikTok-owner Bytedance and Baidu (BIDU) with fines for alleged monopolistic behaviors in corporate acquisitions and floated new rules that could govern the operations at many tech firms.

Tencent is reportedly facing scrutiny for alleged monopolistic practices at its social networking app WeChat. The company which dominates online payments in China via WeChat Pay and owns hugely popular mobile games said in a statement last month that a recent meeting with regulators was “voluntary.”

“Tencent has had meetings with regulators on a regular basis and this was a regular meeting” it said. “We discussed a broad range of topics mainly focused on fostering innovation and creating a healthy environment for industry evolution. Tencent has always and will continue to conduct our operations in compliance with relevant laws and regulations.”

Thank you for being a fan

The rapper DMX who died Friday liked to watch “The Golden Girls” Gabrielle Union revealed in a taping of the foodies show “Hot Ones.” In a clip from 2017 shared on Twitter Union told the host Sean Evans: “DMX loves the “Golden Girls and that’s a real fun fact!”

Union recalled a moment during the filming of “Cradle 2 the Grave” in the early 2000’s when she went to fetch him to film.

“There was a dog biting incident with one of the PAs who had been sent to go get him so after a while no one wanted to go get him so I would be sent because I was a dog person” Union recalled.

Upon entering his trailer the “Ruff Ryder” rapper would say to Union: “Gab! Have a drink! Im gonna watch ‘The Golden Girls’! This s–t is funny.”

“We would have a Heineken and sometimes a little Crown and watch ‘The Golden Girls’” Union said. “And he would laugh hysterically.”

DUK,Duke Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd1c2Yub3JnL2Vjb25vbXktYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS0wNC0xMC90ZWNvLWN1c3RvbWVycy1jb3VsZC1zZWUtcmF0ZS1oaWtlcy1vdmVyLW5leHQtdGhyZWUteWVhcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TECO Customers Could See Rate Hikes Over Next Three Years,"Tampa Electric Co. on Friday filed a proposal seeking more than $400 million in base-rate increases during the next three years saying the additional money would help meet the needs of customers and expand clean energy.

“While the company has undertaken cost-savings initiatives and found productivity efficiencies they are not sufficient for Tampa Electric to continue to meet the electric needs of existing and new customers at current base rates” the company said in the proposal filed at the Florida Public Service Commission.

Tampa Electric which has about 800000 customers in Hillsborough Polk Pasco and Pinellas counties announced in February that it would seek the base-rate increases. But the detailed filing Friday launches a months-long process that is expected to lead to the Public Service Commission deciding later this year whether to approve the request.

Under the proposal Tampa Electric would receive a $295 million increase in base rates in January 2022 followed by increases of $102 million in 2023 and $25.6 million in 2024.

Residential customers who use 1000 kilowatt hours of electricity a month would see their bills go from the current $105.25 to $125.48 in 2022 about a 19 percent increase according to Tampa Electric. The utility industry uses 1000 kilowatt-hour residential bills as a benchmark though actual electric usage varies widely.

The filing and a company news release said the increases would help with projects such as adding more solar power and a “modernization” of the Big Bend Power Station in Hillsborough County. The utility also said that some of the base-rate increases would be offset by lower fuel costs because of more solar power and plant upgrades. Fuel costs are passed along to customers and are separate from base rates.

“To continue delivering the value our customers deserve we must plan for the long term making investments now that create a better energy future” Nancy Tower chief executive officer of Tampa Electric said in a prepared statement. “By modernizing our power plants and making them more efficient as well as expanding solar generation we are reducing fuel costs we are improving air quality in the region we are reducing carbon emissions and we are keeping customer bills more predictable over time.”

Base-rate cases are among the most closely watched issues at the Public Service Commission as they involve large amounts of money and extensive financial and technical details. Tampa Electric is operating under a 2017 rate agreement that will end in December.

The commission also is considering a base-rate case filed last month by Florida Power & Light which is seeking increases over four years. Duke Energy Florida announced in January that it had reached a proposed settlement with representatives of consumers and large commercial electricity users that would lead to increases over three years. The proposed settlement is pending at the commission.

Prince Philip’s children have paid tribute to their father following his death aged 99 with Prince Charles praising the Duke of Edinburgh’s “astonishing” energy.

In interviews recorded for broadcast after the duke’s death they reflected on their relationship with the man who spent his life as the Queen’s consort.

Prince Charles told the BBC that while his father was known for his no-nonsense approach he was good at giving him guidance and always offered faithful support to the Queen.

Charles said: “Well you know he didn’t suffer fools gladly so if you said anything that was in any way ambiguous he’d say ‘Make up your mind.’ So perhaps it made you choose your words carefully.”

He added: “He was very good at showing you how to do things and would instruct you in various things” and that “his energy was astonishing in supporting my Mama and doing it for such a long time.”

Prince Charles is believed to have stayed with the Queen at Windsor Castle until late on Friday while Princes Andrew and Edward arrived on Saturday morning to support their mother as she grieves for her husband of 73 years.

Princess Anne praised the “double act” her father maintained with the Queen. “Without him life will be completely different” she said. The Princess Royal said she would remember her father as an ever-present mentor.

She said: “I will best remember him as always being there and a person you could bounce off ideas but if you were having problems you could always go to him and know that he would listen and try to help.”

The Royal Family together in 1968 ( PA )

Philip’s youngest son Prince Edward the Earl of Wessex said his father had “always been there as that rock in the Queen’s life”.

Edward said: “It was always a challenging role to take but he has done it with the most extraordinary flair and an extraordinary tact and diplomacy.

“He has never ever tried to overshadow the Queen in any shape or form and I think he has always been there as that rock in the Queen’s life and certainly within his family that was exactly the same.”

Edward also said his father had a “wonderful” sense of humour but noted that people could misinterpret things or “turn it against [him]”.

Edward said: “The public image that certain parts of the media would portray was always an unfair depiction. He used to give them as good as he got and always in a very entertaining way ... He was brilliant. Always absolutely brilliant.”

The Queen Prince Philip and their children at their silver wedding anniversary in 1972 ( PA )

Prince Andrew the Duke of York recalled how Philip used to read to the family in the evenings.

Andrew said: “Like any family of the day your parents went out to work during the day but in the evening just the same as any other family we would get together we would sit on the sofa as a group and he would read to us.”

Following the royal’s death and in keeping with the Letters Patent issued when George VI gave Prince Philip the title in 1947 the Prince of Wales has now gained the title of Duke of Edinburgh.

However when Prince Charles ascends the throne the title will “merge with the crown” and can be regranted. It is likely then to be passed on to his brother Prince Edward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vYmF5bmV3czkuY29tL2ZsL3RhbXBhL25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNC8xMS9zdHJ1Y3R1cmUtY29sbGFwc2UtcmVwb3J0ZWQtaW4tcGluZWxsYXMtY291bnR5LWR1cmluZy1zdHJvbmctc3Rvcm1z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weather damage in Pinellas Hillsborough Polk on April 11,"PINELLAS COUNTY Fla. — More strong storms across the region on Sunday left damage to homes and businesses.

The move might even be a relief for Siegenthaler who might actually get to play going forward. However it seems like Siegenthaler was a wasted effort on the part of the Capitals who drafted him in 2015 in the second round worked him into the lineup and ended up benching him when the blue line ran too deep. He was only making $800000 which doesn’t save the Caps very much cap space but also likely means a different move is in the works.

Siegenthaler 23 only played in seven games this season one of which included only one shift late in the game.

On a personal note it was great covering the young defenseman who was very down-to-earth and friendly. As much as I hope the Capitals don’t regret this decision I also wish the absolute best for Siegenthaler and will be rooting for him for the rest of his career.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZWxhd2FyZW9ubGluZS9uYW1lL2dsZW5uLWNvbGVtYW4tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NjY0MTk4M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Glenn Coleman Obituary (1931 - 2021) - Wilmington DE - The News Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/delawareonline/name/glenn-coleman-obituary?id=6641983 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZWxhd2FyZW9ubGluZS9uYW1lL2dsZW5uLWNvbGVtYW4tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NjY0MTk4M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFtLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL2hpc3RvcnkvMjAyMS8wNC8xMS90aGVuLW5vdy1kby15b3Uta25vdy13aGVyZS1pcy83MTAzMjQ3MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Then & Now: Do you know where this is?,"More than 50 years ago A.

Gove a WPI grad was a longtime traffic engineer for Worcester and the state. During World War II he was an engineer for the First Army.

Gove studied the traffic patterns at the intersection. Perhaps he conferred with the owners of businesses such as Dupont Plumbing or Merit Gas.

Ultimately as pictured in our Then photo traffic lights were added replacing a landscape of stop signs and keep-right arrows.

A photographer from The Evening Gazette was dispatched to the intersection on Aug. 19 1964 to capture the colorful new addition. He observed: ""Motorists passing through ... were observed stopping or slowing down even though the square's new traffic lights are not yet turned on.""

But for Asian people across North America and globally this tragedy was one more episode in a long history of anti-Asian violence.

Over 150 years ago white settlers in the United States rounded up Chinese merchants and miners and put them onto burning barges threw them into railway cars and even lynched them. But this story is not limited to the U.S. — early Chinese immigrants were not welcome in Canada either.

This is documented in the life and works of Chinese-Canadian author and journalist Edith Eaton (1865-1914). While researching Becoming Sui Sin Far: Early Fiction Journalism and Travel Writing by Edith Maude Eaton I discovered numerous accounts of early Canadian anti-Chinese racism in her work.

Memoirs from the past show similar hatred

In Eaton’s memoir Leaves from the Mental Portfolio of an Eurasian she recalls being called “Chinky Chinky Chinaman yellow-face pig-tail rat-eater” after moving to North America with her family — a white father Chinese mother and five siblings — in 1872.

Soon after the family’s arrival in Montréal locals would call out “Chinese!” “Chinoise!” as they walked down the street. Classmates would pull Eaton’s hair pinch her and refuse to sit beside her.

These taunts and torments were felt deeply by Eaton throughout her life. She wrote:

“I have come from a race on my mother’s side which is said to be the most stolid and insensible to feeling of all races. Yet I look back over the years and see myself so keenly alive to every shade of sorrow and suffering that it is almost a pain to live.”

Eaton published a book of short stories depicting Chinese immigrants’ encounters with racism under the pseudonym “Sui Sin Far” (Cantonese for narcissus). And her advocacy was appreciated by Chinese people in Montréal who erected a memorial beside her grave with the inscription “Yi bu wang hua” which means “The righteous one does not forget China.”

Since the Atlanta shootings Asian women have been assaulted and even killed. Asian people have been accused of causing COVID-19 stealing intellectual property and more. What Eaton described in her fiction and memoir continues to happen today.

Montréal Daily Star

1890s headlines interchangeable with today’s

Eaton also documented anti-Chinese violence and championed the rights of Chinese immigrants in stories published in the Montréal Star and the Montréal Witness throughout the 1890s.

At the time white men were convinced that Chinese immigrants were taking their jobs away and that Chinese men — many of whom lived alone behind their shops (because of the Head Tax — had an unfair advantage over white men with families.

In the Montréal Star Eaton published A Plea for the Chinaman in which she called out politicians for mistreating Chinese men in Canada:

“Every just person must feel his or her sense of justice outraged by the attacks which are being made by public men upon the Chinese who come to this country.… It makes one’s cheeks burn to read about men of high office standing up and abusing a lot of poor foreigners behind their backs and calling them all the bad names their tongues can utter.”

Anti-Chinese violence was so common in 1890s Montréal that Chinese men carried police whistles in their pockets. In an 1895 article titled Beaten to Death Eaton noted that even when they blew their whistles no one would come to Chinese men’s aid. Bystanders often refused to identify their assailants and police told the men who had been assaulted that they should be arrested for bothering them.

The recent reports of a security guard’s refusal to act when a Filipino woman was brutally beaten uncannily recall the anti-Asian violence Eaton documented 125 years ago.

My research leads me to suspect that Eaton published other unsigned articles documenting anti-Chinese racism in Montreal newspapers at this time. She may have written a Gazette article reporting on youth who would gather nightly in Montreal’s Chinatown to throw stones at passing Chinese men and through the plate glass windows of their businesses or those describing Chinese men being punched kicked or beaten to death.

What was written when?

Looking at literature and journalism of the past such as Eaton’s can help illuminate the challenges of today. Her observations about people’s motivations — ignorance jealousy suspicion competition — invite us to reflect on the motivations of today’s perpetrators of anti-Asian violence and conclude that not much has changed.

The anti-Asian racism recorded in Eaton’s work and journalism across Montreal persists today. Recent reports of racist violence hate crimes verbal harassment opaque policing and passive bystanders could have been written more than a century ago.

We have a long way to go and a lot of work to do to make up for over a century of treating Asian people like they do not belong.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcDI0LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvMjA2NTU1NzYuc2thdGVib2FyZGVycy1jYWxsLXNwYWNlLWNpdHktYm9vbS1wb3B1bGFyaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Skateboarders call for more space in the city after boom in popularity,"But skateboarders in Norwich say they have become the target of abuse and unfair criticism after a lack of suitable spaces to skate has left them pushed into the city centre.

For years skateboarding has been labelled as an anti-social activity where groups congregate and cause trouble.

But skaters in Norwich said this could not be further from the truth.

As the pandemic hit in the last year hundreds have taken up the sport.

But as more take to the streets and skateparks the problems skaters face has come to the fore.

Sam Avery is the owner of the Drug Store skate shop which will be reopening at a temporary site on Bridewell Alley on Monday April 12.

He has long campaigned for Norwich to become a more “skate-friendly” city and was involved with the build of Eaton skatepark in 2010.

But more than a decade later he said the skating community is now ten times the size but nowhere else has been built and skateparks across the city have been allowed to go into ruin.

Following recent complaints from residents about skateboarders in the city centre Mr Avery said the attitude towards skaters needs to change.

The 41-year-old said: “With any group you have the odd bad kid but 99pc of skateboarders are pleasant respectful people.

“But skating gets treated like an anti-social activity when it isn’t.

“It is not only physically beneficial but there have been studies done on mental health benefits especially for young people.

“It can be a really positive activity but it's difficult when there isn't a place for people to do it without feeling like that going to be harassed kicked out sent packing shouted out or abused in some way.”

He added: “When I started skateboarding there weren’t any skateparks.

“You would just venture around your town and find things to skate on.

“Skateboarding came from the streets and it will always be a street activity. But skateparks are useful for people to go to be safe to learn and practice.

“The easiest way to create more space would be to re-do the pre-existing parks Fiddlewood or even the older part of Eaton park.

“There is a park at Loddon which is a really good template for the council who want to provide a space without spending a fortune.

“What we would love to see is for Norwich to become a skate-friendly city where they incorporate skateboarding into future planning.""

Eaton is the biggest and most popular skatepark in the city but in recent months it has become “overcrowded” and “dangerous” as skateboarders roller skaters BMXers and children on scooters fight for space.

But other parks such as Fiddlewood and Heathgate are usually avoided due to old and “badly-designed"" ramps and rough tarmac flooring - which can cause injuries for skaters.

A Norwich City Council spokesman said: “We are very proud of the skate facility at Eaton Park which has been popular for over a decade. It was funded through an £8m investment agreement with the Homes and Communities Agency and was designed to national competition standard.

“Through this and other activities and facilities throughout the city we are glad to offer a multitude of opportunities for recreation.

“Local government budgets have become increasingly challenging to balance in recent years and the profound financial impact of Covid has only made things harder.

“Our Covid recovery plan sets out a clear route to help the city bounce back from this hugely difficult stage in our history and any trends that have emerged due to the pandemic will be explored.”

Alex Williams 21 a UEA student and president of the skate society said: “We would like to see less denial from the council that we exist.

“There is now a massive skate scene in Norwich - it’s an amazing community.

“You see all of these places for people to play football tennis and basketball . We need the space to do our sport.

“We just want to see our community grow and for people to appreciate skating. We put blood sweat and tears into it because we love it.”

Mr Avery along with his business-partner and mayor of Beccles Ashley Lever will submit a planning application for the build of a new store and indoor skate space – called Community East - within the currently disused St Peter Parmentergate church on Kings Street.

If the plans are approved they hope to provide a “community-space” for people to come and learn socialise and skate in the colder months.

A disabled woman said she was left unable to shower for over a month due to delayed repair works at her home.

Kath Beeson 57 said she was told by housing provider EMH Homes that work to install a wet room would take two weeks.

Kath who uses a wheelchair said her shower was taken out on March 7 and she was only able to have her first shower yesterday morning April 10.

She said she “could have cried” after being able to wash properly for the first time in weeks at her Long Eaton home.

The director of housing at EMH Homes said it offered ""sincere apologies"" and admitted that the delay to the installation of the wet room was ""unacceptable"".

Kath who is housebound due to her disability and agoraphobia had recently recovered from a nervous breakdown.

The work was halted after part of the bathroom was ripped out and workers found rot in the joists.

By March 31 the kitchen ceiling fell through leaving a gaping hole in the roof which then required further work.

Mum-of-three Kath a former carer said: “It has completely broken me I’ve cried every day and every night since it started. I am sat here in a complete mess.

“I have suffered since March 8 and the work still isn’t finished. I am annoyed hurt upset and angry.

“I have felt dirty this whole time sat here day in day out thinking I smell. I've got myself in such a state.

“It takes me two hours to wash my hair and have a shower at the kitchen sink. To be treated like this is disgusting.""

Kath said because her sink was taken out when she uses the bathroom ""three or four times"" during the night she has to use her stairlift to get downstairs to wash her hands in the kitchen sink.

In response to EMH’s apology sent to Nottinghamshire Live Kath said: “They need to swallow their words. I cannot accept that apology because they haven't turned up today (Saturday April 10) to do the plastering on the hole in the ceiling.

“I haven't even had a phone call off them.

“I’ve wanted a wet room for three years and now but I've had nothing but grief from it.

“I've got no words at all I’m absolutely heartbroken. It has been a nightmare and I don't want anyone else to go through what I've been through.""

Kath’s friend Sarah Carr 43 said: “This work should have taken two weeks from March 8.

“Kath has been fobbed off left right and centre.

“We aren’t getting told what’s happening we're being passed pillar to post.

“Kath is constantly in tears due to it all. She’s a very clean lady and this has made her ill.”

Sarah of Long Eaton added: “What worries me is how many other people are going through this.

“We don’t know where to turn we are always waiting for the next problem.”

Christine Ashton Executive Director of Housing for EMH homes: “Our main concern is the safety and wellbeing of our residents. We were very concerned to hear about the delays experienced in having the wet room installed. We understand how difficult it must be for our resident and offer our sincere apologies.

""Once we were notified by Derbyshire County Council’s contractor on 11 March that the joist in the floor needed replacing before their work to install the wet room could continue we completed the work by 15 March to allow the County Council to resume their work. As the wet room is directly above the kitchen regrettably there was some damage to the ceiling but this was kept to a minimum and was repaired at the same time as the joist was replaced.

""We realise that the time it has taken to install the wet room is unacceptable and we will review our arrangements to ensure that in future we can keep the resident informed of any delays. Once again we offer our apologies.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2J1cnl0b2RheS5jby51ay9uZXdzL21pY2hlbGluLXN0YXItcmVzdGF1cmFudC10aGUtd29vZHNwZWVuLWJhY2std2l0aC1uZXctbG9vay05MTk1MDczL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2J1cnl0b2RheS5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FtcC9taWNoZWxpbi1zdGFyLXJlc3RhdXJhbnQtdGhlLXdvb2RzcGVlbi1iYWNrLXdpdGgtbmV3LWxvb2stOTE5NTA3My8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michelin star restaurant The Woodspeen back with new look,"From left: The Woodspeen’s director of operations Alessandro Fasoli head chef Olly Rouse executive chef Peter Eaton and general manager Andre Marchand

THE team at The Woodspeen are working hard to ensure they are ready as they prepare to reopen for the third time in 12 months.

As soon as the Government announced that outdoor hospitality would be able to resume in England from tomorrow the Michelin-star restaurant set about devising a plan to install a Covid-secure outside dining space.

The new covered area features high ceilings covered with chandeliers and heaters to keep diners warm during the chillier evenings.

The marquee features a reception area and has a Mediterranean feel with large vases and trees offering views of the picturesque surroundings.

Outside service will run from noon until late evening so that guests have the flexibility to dine at any time.

Director of operations at The Woodspeen Alessandro Fasoli said: “Considering our last service was Friday December 18 a spring ‘alfresco’ re-opening at The Woodspeen is very much welcome.

“The hospitality industry as a whole has been hit very hard but I cannot think of anything better after this difficult period than to relax and truly enjoy great hospitality with friends colleagues and loved ones.”

He admitted that organising the re-opening of a Michelin-star restaurant is “not an easy exercise”.

“There are hundreds of processes that need to slot naturally together at a precise moment under restrictions and in an outdoor-only environment” he said.

“The most important thing for us is to be able to deliver great hospitality no matter the weather.

“At the start of lockdown we moved a table and few chairs to the middle of the empty terrace we sat and imagined what we would like our guests to feel like when returning to us.

“We concluded that an airy modern quality-focused environment needed to be created.

“We will still have limitations in place to respect but we are blessed that we have one of the best outside dining areas in Berkshire.”

Mr Fasoli said The Woodspeen’s top priority during lockdown had been to make sure the team was happy.

He added: “It has been difficult for staff. I am personally blessed to work with [executive chef] Peter Eaton and [general manager] Andre Marchand who are not only a Michelin star chef and world class manager but have also really looked after the team’s mental health.

“At The Woodspeen our biggest asset is our team and it always will be.”

During lockdown The Woodspeen has introduced a new concept called Woodspeen at Home where it offered a pick-up or delivery of three-course menus designed by its chefs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlcmJ5dGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy90aHVncy1kcnVua3Mtd2hvLWJlZW4tdGhyb3VnaC01Mjc4NjYw0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVyYnl0ZWxlZ3JhcGguY28udWsvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL3RodWdzLWRydW5rcy13aG8tYmVlbi10aHJvdWdoLTUyNzg2NjAuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thugs and drunks who have been through our courts,"Something went wrong please try again later.

Each of the 20 black and white sketches artfully depicts a natural landscape. Pine trees and mountains set against a bright orb in the sky. Cartoonish leaves splayed out like tentacles. Unearthly limestone columns towering before an ominous cloud.

Their origins though are darker: They are believed to have been created by an artist in Manzanar the concentration camp in California's Owens Valley where thousands of Japanese Americans were incarcerated as a result of the United States government's racism and hysteria during World War II.

When Japanese American community leaders were alerted recently to the fact that these drawings had been put up for sale on eBay they immediately began organizing to stop the auction.

""We don't feel that Japanese American history -- particularly around the trauma of racist policies that excluded forcibly removed and incarcerated 120000 residents from the West Coast -- should be sold or used for profit"" said Rick Noguchi chief operating officer for the Japanese American National Museum.

After a meeting with Japanese American activists on April 6 just hours before the auction was set to end eBay decided to halt the sale of the artifacts determining that it violated the company's artifacts policy. At the time the bidding had reached $470.

For the coalition of Japanese Americans behind the effort to cancel that sale eBay's move was a victory. But ultimately they want to ensure that all World War II artifacts born out of the tragedy and suffering of Japanese Americans can no longer be bought and sold.

This wasn't the first such sale

The drawings from Manzanar are just the latest artifacts from Japanese American concentration camps to be saved from the auction block.

In 2015 a New Jersey auction house was set to sell a collection of about 450 such objects including paintings photographs and handmade jewelry. The artifacts had been collected by the crafts expert Allen Eaton and eventually came into the hands of a family friend who had decided to put them up for sale.

After protests by Japanese Americans the auction house withdrew the items which were eventually acquired by the Japanese American National Museum.

Nancy Ukai project director for the digital history website 50objects.org was one of the leading voices behind the effort to stop that sale.

Her grandfather and mother along with several other relatives were incarcerated in the camps during the 1940's. She recalled a story about how her grandfather afraid that he'd never experience the smell of eucalyptus leaves again brought the plant with him to the camp.

""Artifacts have a really important meaning to not only me but to our community"" Ukai said. ""There's a greater understanding in the world now that things have histories and that these histories have been erased or concealed or allowed to stand uncontested.""

The now-withdrawn listing on eBay comes at a time when Asian Americans have been experiencing heightened racism and discrimination.

That sales of objects from Japanese American concentration camps continue to proliferate is just part of that pattern said David Inoue executive director of the civil rights organization Japanese American Citizens League.

""It's very triggering for many people to see these items now being placed up for sale on eBay by unrelated individuals who perhaps obtained them through chance or random randomness but perhaps don't understand the meaning behind what these artifacts actually do bear for the families that were incarcerated"" Inoue said.

She believes her father drew the sketches

Lori Matsumura a third-generation Japanese American in Santa Monica California first learned of the drawings on eBay from a ranger at the Manzanar Historical Site.

Matsumura is the granddaughter of Giichi Matsumura who was incarcerated at Manzanar and disappeared during an outing in the mountains after stopping to paint. Her father Masaru Matsumura was an artist too. The ranger wondered if the sketches signed ""MATSUMURA"" might have been drawn by one of her family members.

When Matsumura looked at the listing she said she believed the drawings to be her father's. She even compared the signatures on them to an old high school assignment of his -- and the two appeared similar.

Matsumura's first reaction was to bid on the collection a desperate attempt to acquire what she felt were important family mementos. Then the gravity of the situation sunk in.

""It just made me angry that I would have to bid on my own family's artwork to get it back"" she said.

Multiple families with the name ""Matsumura"" were incarcerated at Manzanar and Lori Matsumura's claim to the drawings hasn't yet been verified.

Japanese American groups who spoke with CNN said that they hoped to work with eBay on brokering a conversation between Matsumura and the seller -- and potentially facilitate a return of the items.

The provenance of the items is unclear

It's unclear how the drawings came into the hands of the eBay seller whose full identity is unknown.

The seller told the Associated Press that the collection came from the family of a former girlfriend in the 1980s though they declined to confirm this detail to CNN.

In messages to CNN the seller described themselves as a small time art and antiques dealer and said they weren't aware that they were violating eBay's artifacts policy which prohibits the sale of items from government or protected land.

The seller apologized for the hurt caused by the listing and expressed a willingness to send the items their rightful owner.

""I am not interested in making a profit on these pieces since they are part of history"" the seller wrote. ""I would rather give them away to a right individual rather than donate them to an institution.""

Other artifacts from this era are still up for sale

That eBay removed the drawings from auction is a significant first step Inoue said.

But numerous other artifacts from the period of Japanese American incarceration continue to be sold on the platform.

The Japanese American Confinement Sites Consortium a collective dedicated to preserving the historical experiences of Japanese Americans during World War II says they're continuing to work with eBay on applying its artifacts policy to similar items.

Inoue said that his organization and other members of the consortium also planned to discuss with eBay the potential creation of algorithms that would be able to flag violations of the company's policies on the front end.

Noguchi the COO for the Japanese American National Museum says the group would like to see all items associated with Japanese American concentration camps be banned for sale on eBay. (eBay did not respond to a question from CNN about whether it was considering such a ban.)

""It is offensive to see and to have this reminder that people are profiting off of this history"" he said. ""For many Japanese Americans that either were affected by those policies or had parents or grandparents affected by them it's just a really negative reminder of it.""

Check eBay - Inside the Magic,"If you like Disney collectibles then you likely have noticed that McDonald’s offers quite the selection with their Happy Meals toys. Every once in a while McDonald’s will release a new Disney toy collection with their Happy Meals — and they tend to become immensely popular among fans often selling out.

Another reason the toys are so popular is that it is tough to collect all of the toys as customers will never know if the McDonald’s they are going to has their desired toy available. It really is quite a challenge and can be disappointing to those who want to complete their sets but are not able to.

This is not something new as eBay sellers have been putting up Disney Happy Meal toys online for years but clearly customers keep wanting more!

It seems that the popularity of these toys and the desire to collect them has grown so big that people are now turning to eBay to purchase them! If we take a look we can see that the current Disney Happy Meal collection which offers both Star Wars and Disney Princesses is already being sold with some asking prices around $4.99 apiece — each item costs $1.88 in-store — or nearly $40.00 for the set.

The current Disney Princess set includes:

Tiana from Princess and the Frog

Cinderella from Cinderella

Ariel from The Little Mermaid

Jasmine from Aladdin

Moana from Moana

Belle from Beauty and the Beast

Snow White from Snow White

Mulan from Mulan

And the Star Wars set features:

Yoda

Darth Vadar

Stormtrooper

Boba Fett

Chewbacca

Finn

Kylo Ren

Poe Dameron

Sith Trooper

Previously McDonald’s was selling a Disney World inspired Happy Meal toy set which had various Disney World attractions that all connected together to form a train. The asking price for this full set is nearly $80.00!

That collection included:

Goofy on a train from Mickey and Minnie’s Runaway Railway

Mickey and Minnie Mouse in the car from Mickey and Minnie’s Runaway Railway

Mickey Mouse on the Mission Space attraction at EPCOT

Minnie Mouse riding the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Magic Kingdom

Donald Duck in a teacup from Mad Tea Party

Pluto in a boat from the Jungle Cruise

Mickey Mouse at the Hollywood Tower Hotel from the Tower of Terror

Daisy Duck riding Soarin’ Around the World (and Spaceship Earth) at EPCOT

Goofy and the Yeti at Expedition Everest from Disney’s Animal Kingdom

Minnie Mouse in a Time Rover from DINOSAUR

There are also a variety of older Disney Happy Meal toys available for Disney fans to purchase so if you are someone who is missing a piece from a previous collection you can search eBay to see if someone else is offering it.

Although the prices for each toy are not astronomical they are certainly more than the standard retail price at McDonald’s. And it is interesting to see how many sellers have the toys and how many people are purchasing them!

Well now the company has announced that the eBay app on iOS and Android will allow users to scan various Pokemon trading cards for quick and easy listing.

eBay’s New Trading Card Scanning Feature

The company announced the feature recently via a press release. The new feature is aimed towards the digital marketplace’s massive trading card community that recently saw a growth of 142%. It will as per eBay will cut down the listing time of trading cards to half.

“Among our 185 million shoppers around the world we’ve seen unparalleled demand for trading cards over the past year with four million more sold than the year prior” says Nicole Colombo Head of Trading Cards and Collectibles at eBay.

At launch which is slated for late April the new scanning feature will only support Magic: The Gathering cards. Going forward however eBay aims to expand the support to Pokemon and Yu Gi Oh! cards in May and later to other collectible card games and sports trading cards.

How Does It Work?

Now the new trading card scanning feature in eBay will leverage computer vision technology to detect the cards. As a result all the sellers need to do is point their smartphone camera at the card they want to sell. The app will automatically scan the card and provide the relevant result.

So as eBay explains sellers can use the new feature in three simple steps:

Step 1 – Open the eBay app on Android or iOS and start a listing with a game name. In the search UI select the new “Tap to search with your camera” option.

– Open the eBay app on Android or iOS and start a listing with a game name. In the search UI select the new “Tap to search with your camera” option. Step 2 – Point the smartphone camera towards a trading card and let the app scan it.

– Point the smartphone camera towards a trading card and let the app scan it. Step 3 – Select the relevant results from the listing.

“Our new listing feature will not only create a faster and more convenient experience for our sellers but will also provide more robust trading card inventory for shoppers – all while ensuring that the information in card listings is more accurate” added Colombo.

So following the new update trading card sellers will be able to list their products more quickly on the platform. Moreover apart from the said feature eBay will also add a few enhancements to support the trading card community. These include improved returns low-cost shipping options and protection of buyers and sellers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVycG9vbGVjaG8uY28udWsvbmV3cy9saXZlcnBvb2wtbmV3cy9jb3VwbGUtYnV5LTcyZnQtd3dpaS1zaGlwLTIwMzQxODI50gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZXJwb29sZWNoby5jby51ay9uZXdzL2xpdmVycG9vbC1uZXdzL2NvdXBsZS1idXktNzJmdC13d2lpLXNoaXAtMjAzNDE4MjkuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Couple buy 72ft WWII ship off eBay in ultimate restoration project,"Something went wrong please try again later.

A couple who stumbled across an old WWII ship on eBay say the purchase was ‘a heart over head decision’ which led to them taking on the ultimate restoration project.

Gemma and Simon Robins who are camper van renovation specialists by trade purchased the ‘ML 1392’ in January after they ‘fell in love’ with the vessel.

Buying the 72ft war ship was never part of the couple’s original life plan however Gemma from Huyton said after viewing it for the first time it pulled on her heartstrings because it had so much history.

Speaking to the ECHO Gemma described the couple’s maiden voyage into the unknown saying: “We didn’t plan on buying a ship but Simon would always sit there at night and look at eBay.

“One night I was brushing my teeth and he was lying in bed and he was like ‘look at this boat’. I had a look at it and I thought ‘what are you thinking about?’

“Usually I would just brush him off with his crazy ideas but I was looking at it and realised what a historical boat she was.

“I never ever wanted a boat that big in my life but it sort of pulled on my heartstrings.

“The people who owned the boat before the person we bought it off they were going to scrap her and take the engines out and sell them.

“So the fella who we bought it off was like ‘you can’t do that she is a piece of history ’.

The ship now called Sarinda has a compelling past having been a navigation leader during the D-day landings in June 1944.

She also aided in the capture of a German submarine in March 1945. Since then the ship has had many homes and has unfortunately fallen into disrepair.

Gemma added: “She was a WWII boat on D-day and to see her neglected and left to rot it was a heart over the head decision because we haven’t really got the budget to do it so we went to look at it the next day and we fell in love with it.”

The ship was set for the scrapyard and Gemma revealed it was her mum who encouraged the couple to buy it adding: “It was my mum she was like ‘oh Gemma just buy just buy it’ so she encouraged us to get it.”

“It’s hard to say how much it will cost to renovate and repair. She’s a massive boat she’s 72ft long she’s got five bedrooms and she needs totally gutting and starting again.

“The superstructure is all rotten and falling apart and the only really good part of the boat is the engines which still run and the actual hull which is originally from WWII.

“When we bought her I said to Simon we could probably scrape enough money to buy her but we haven’t got any money to fix her. So we knew it was going to be a long-term project.”

In order to track and document their progress the couple decided to create a YouTube channel dedicated to the restoration of the ship.

Originally meant as a means to update family and friends due to Covid restrictions the channel has caught the interest and imagination of big boat lovers.

In the space of three months the channel aptly named Ship Happens has notched up 22000 subscribers.

Gemma who confessed she had no idea about YouTube or video editing prior couldn’t quite believe the attention her new channel had received.

She said: “The whole YouTube idea we only filmed it for the family. Because of Covid no one could come and see it so we said we’d film it so all the family could see it online and the channel just took off.

“We didn’t expect it at all because we’re not YouTubers or anything like that we’re just normal people.

“The channel just skyrocketed so we had to get a bit more professional because we’re not photographers and it’s taken me ages to edit videos because it’s all new to me.

“The support we’re getting on YouTube now is just phenomenal and because of the ship’s historical background there are a lot of people who want to see her restored and back to a nice condition. It’s blown us away to be honest.

“People are sending us parts to help us with the project which is just great.”

The hard work begins now for Gemma and Simon who have laid the groundwork for future works on the ship to begin. The possibilities and potential of the former WWII ship are endless.

Gemma a mum of two added: “We didn’t really think of a plan when we bought her but there are endless possibilities whether it’s our private holiday home or whether we can rent it out.

“It’s hard work but it will be worth it in the end. Simon said he wants to keep it for life and retire on it.

“We knew it was a big challenge and that’s why we gave ourselves a number of years to get it done. We knew it would be a very long-term project with a limited budget. We’re trying to do as much as we can with the time we’ve got and the budget we’ve got.”

Conscious that the renovation of the boat will cost them upwards of £50000 the couple have been overwhelmed with the support and donations not just by friends and family but complete strangers who have taken an interest in their journey.

After weeks of being tormented by rats a Dunedin homeowner wants to know why she appears to be alone in fighting off the horde.

Janice Walsh said she first noticed the rats around her Caversham house two weeks ago and had seen them every night since about 10 o’clock.

She tried poison and traps but had little success.

In previous years she would find evidence of rats but never this early in the year and she never actually saw any rats she said.

She contacted the Otago Regional Council but had not heard that it was doing anything about it.

As she did not know where the rats were coming from she did not know who else to contact.

She spoke to Ecolab about controlling the pests and was told to continue using traps and to move them regularly.

Mrs Walsh said she felt like she was dealing with the infestation alone.

""It falls back financially on the homeowner but they’re coming from someone else’s property so why do they not have to put some bait stations around? Why are they not trying to control them?""

Her neighbours were also dealing with rats she said.

""Everyone has them.""

Mrs Walsh had no idea why the rats were out earlier this year but the rodents were causing her a lot of stress.

""I’m very tired. I’m going to cry"" she said.

""I don’t mind putting out bait and setting traps but someone down the line has to take responsibility.""

Regional council biosecurity manager and rural liaison Andrea Howard said there were no rules for landowners around controlling rats barring specific sites such as the Otago Peninsula and the regional council did not help manage rats outside of those areas.

She said there were a range of options for controlling rats and the regional council encouraged people to contact a pest control expert and explore possible solutions.

Conceived in the early 80s by Rod McConnell and Jim Yarborough their idea was to create an open-ended space exploration game with random encounters and resource collection. Today you'd think of No Man's Sky Mass Effect or Elite Dangerous; even by 1986 when the PC original of Starflight was finally published nothing like Starflight existed despite distant relatives such as the space trading game Elite.

Towards the end of 1982 McConnell formed a company Ambient Designs to work on the concept - known as Starquest at this point - with the blessing of the embryonic publisher. One of his first employees was programmer Alec Kercso. ""I was in my senior year at UC San Diego when I met Rod"" says Kercso. ""At the time most people and certainly most students didn't have a personal computer at their desk and compared to today there wasn't nearly the number of games out there."" While finishing up his degree in linguistics Kercso fondly recalls playing classic adventures such as Rogue and Zork enjoying the exploration and puzzle solving aspects they both presented. In February 1983 he interviewed for a programming role with McConnell returning to university with a job and a book on the programming language Forth. He also purchased an Atari 800 - the home computer that Starflight was intended for.

Also studying linguistics (actually a sub-division known as bio-linguistics) and rooming with Kercso at college was Greg Johnson. Curious about the exciting project that his friend had become involved in Johnson's interest in Starflight led to him making some early key contributions. ""When I came onto the project I was very enthusiastic about creating a whole universe a deep story and alien races with personalities while putting the player into a big adventure. I managed to convince them and the project changed direction."" he explains. One of the most memorable facets of Starflight its overarching story complete with an extraordinary twist had been set in motion.

The Binary Systems crew inside the cockpit of a Boeing 747. Rod McConnell's day job was a pilot.

Beginning in a circular star base that instantly betrays Starflight's main inspiration TV series Star Trek the player first assembles their team and assigns training to each crew member in the familiar roles of science officer navigator and so on. Following this it's time to pimp up your spaceship before beaming aboard and setting off to the stars. There's a catastrophic event brewing: stars throughout the galaxy are flaring up destroying any planet within their fiery reach. The crew's ultimate goal is to discover what's causing these occurrences in order to prevent the same happening to their home planet of Arth. Throughout the galaxy roam many alien craft each with its own personality and demands and the quest for endurium (Starflight's equivalent of Star Trek's dilithium crystals) drives the need to explore new worlds and extract their valuable minerals.

""For all of us it was our first videogame and we pretty much made it all up as went along"" reveals Johnson. ""Star Trek was definitely the biggest influence and maybe to some extent Dungeons & Dragons in general."" Interestingly Johnson was mentored in his student days by Paul Reiche who would go on to design the first two Star Control games along with Fred Ford. In a neat development cycle Reiche used his experience helping Johnson and his colleagues with Starflight to design his own series of which the Binary Systems game is often cited as an influence before Johnson lent his own experience on Starflight to his friend and Star Control.

By the end of 1983 the Starflight team had expanded to include designer/programmers Bob Gonsalves and Tim Lee joining Kercso McConnell Yarborough Johnson and an experienced engineer called Dave Boulton. It was a large team for a videogame of the time - although unsurprising considering what they were looking to create. ""That was part of the original concept"" explains Kercso. ""We wanted to create a game the likes of which had no-one had seen before. It wasn't going to be just a single game but an entire universe.""

How the player reacts and treats alien encounters such as this is a key part of Starflight.

The idea was staggering and it was soon apparent the Atari 800 would not be up to the job. ""Maybe nine to ten months in we made the decision that [the Atari 800] wasn't going to be viable"" continues Kercso. ""So we changed platforms to the Commodore 64... for all of one month."" Tim Lee a veteran PC coder suggested that they switch to that platform instigating Starflight's third and final development cycle. Now ensconced on its ideal platform development on Starflight began in earnest. Given the new ground that was being explored customization was high. ""We started with a version of Forth called valForth"" says Kercso. ""But contracted with Glen Tenney who created a custom version of the Forth platform specifically for Starflight."" Meanwhile Tim Lee wrote the graphics routines - at the time amazingly fast - while Kercso and his fellow coders tried to pull it all together. ""Remember it was the early 80s; there weren't libraries of code we could download to drop into the game. Everything was custom.""

The scope for Starflight was incredible. ""Sometimes ignorance is a blessing"" grins Johnson. ""If we had really been aware of what we were trying to do we probably wouldn't have attempted it."" Dave Boulton feeling that they were becoming too ambitious left the team. Continues Johnson ""I loved Dave and was very sad to see him go. He was such a nice and super smart guy - I can't remember exactly why he left but I do know he had his concerns.""

Boulton's fears were understandable. Starflight was growing and becoming problematic. ""That was probably the biggest issue with the game"" explains Kercso. ""As we worked on it we thought of a few new things we could add and new plot lines. Its development was as much of an experience of discovery as the gameplay of the final game."" One of the most important technical aspects of Starflight was the Fractal Planet Generator Dave Boulton's hypothesis for creating the game's huge galaxy that was revamped and implemented by Tim Lee as Johnson explains. ""Tim came up with the idea of using fractals and a seed number to generate an entire galaxy right down to the terrain and individual lifeforms of every single planet. The key was that the information was stored in the algorithm and rules for generation and not the data. In other words it would be generated the same every time and there was virtually no limit to the size - all you needed was the right rule set.""

Starflight designer Greg Johnson circa 1984.

For a linguistics student such as Johnson the interaction between the player and alien species was a highlight of development. ""We had AI for combat and AI for conversation"" he remembers. ""But the really fun and interesting bit was the conversation and relationship AI."" Using a system that's still remarkable even by today's standards the aliens' reaction to the player depended on multiple levels of postures and dialogue. ""Every alien race had what we called Emotional Disposition Levels - or EDLs - and things you could do like raise shields arm weapons and the races on board your ship would drive that up or down."" The EDL had a short-term reaction that would change rapidly and a long-term factor that changed more slowly. With each race holding different thresholds within the scale the result was a complex system that meant the player had to be very careful and considered during alien encounters. ""It was an awesome system. I designed it but all of the engineers on the team helped think it through and make it workable. We worked really well together.""

Each member of the close-knit team provided a fundamental part of Starflight. ""We haven't even talked about Bob Gonsalves involvement yet"" notes Kercso. Originally on board to help with the Atari 800 version when the game moved to PC Gonsalves programmed the entire terrain vehicle on-planet experience. ""He was another experienced programmer and I learned a lot from him. As he gained a reputation for solving pernicious bugs we gave him a nickname; Bob Gonsalves became 'Bob Can Solve This'."" Additionally the team infused the game with their own quirks and ideas. Kercso himself created the impatient toe-tap of the starport spaceman avatar while everybody added their own personal artifact that could be found on a random planet. ""My own was the 'red herring' a very valuable object that was 0.1 cubic metres larger than the maximum capacity of the terrain vehicle!"" he adds impishly.

Development on Starflight was unusually long. The Electronic Arts contract was signed at the end of 1982; development began in 1983 and with the change of formats and ambition elongating matters by 1985 it was still going by which time Sierra On-line had almost released the first in its Space Quest games causing the name change from Starquest to Starflight.

Around the same time Ambient Designs became Binary Systems but irrespective of name changes the game would never have stood a chance without its dedicated publisher support. ""Necessary re-designs and major technical hurdles slowed the project and cast a lot of doubt whether it would ever be completed"" recalls Kercso and Rod McConnell's passion for the game played a vital role. ""Rod did an amazing job of convincing Joe [Ybarra Starflight's manager at EA] and in turn Joe of convincing EA senior management that we would not only get the job done but that the end result would be worth it.""

The vital starmap.

In the end it's hard to imagine the suits at the fledgling publisher disappointed. Binary Systems had produced a truly ground-breaking title that had found its natural home on PC. ""Bing Gordon one of the original founders of EA told us that he stopped sleeping for a few nights as he got sucked into the game"" smiles Johnson. ""We got lots of positive feedback and we were just exhausted and excited to finally get the game out into the world."" Over one million copies sold later and despite the monumental effort it was all worth it.

Coming on two 360 KB floppy disks simply squeezing Starflight's massive universe onto those two floppies was an achievement to be proud of. User approval was high too. Gamers like EA's Bing Gordon took to the open-galaxy gameplay investing themselves mind and body into their own bespoke world of exploration and discovery. That investment would spectacularly pay off in the conclusion to the game's main story and the plot twist that suddenly left the brave explorer questioning their own morality and actions.

The source of the solar flares is a Crystal Planet wandering around the galaxy and causing the stars to destroy all life in their respective systems. After discovering remnants of the Old Empire on Earth the player is eventually led to the Crystal Planet and makes a startling discovery: the endurium that they've been using to burn their way around the galaxy is actually a living sentient being.

""I have always disliked stories where the bad guys are simply evil"" notes Johnson. ""In fact it was quite an 'aha!' moment when I came up with the idea that the player themselves would be the aggressor. It was really intended to make the player need to think a bit - isn't that the point of all good science fiction?"" Like Mass Effect 20 odd years later decisions have consequences and there's always something out there waiting to be discovered.

A popular Sega Mega Drive port followed in 1991.

Starflight's success meant a sequel was quickly put into development with Commodore 64 Amiga Atari ST and Sega Mega Drive ports of the first game all appearing over time. For those involved it remains a life-changing experience.

""I still count Starflight as one of my most significant works"" tells Kercso. ""I mean here we are 35 years later and not only am I doing this interview but I still get occasional fan mail. When someone tells you how much they loved Starflight and that's why they studied computer science and became a software engineer well that's a fantastic feeling."" Like Kercso Johnson still receives fan mail from time to time as he also continues to try and bring new Starflight adventures into reality. ""We almost succeeded with a crowdfunding campaign a few years back and right now there are some people working on an anthology of short stories set in the Starflight universe.""

Since Starflight Johnson has scored further successes most notably with the ToeJam & Earl games and continues to work in the industry 35 years after the release of his first game. ""Yeah I am still chugging away as a starving indie developer and remain super proud of the work we did. It was an amazing team and Starflight was my first game and like your first date or kiss it's something that has a very special place and meaning.""

The $81 million Liberal and Creative Arts Building will provide a new home for the Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts Department administrators and the dean’s staff for the College of Liberal and Creative Arts. Mark Cavagnero is responsible for the design.

The four-story building will yield 75000 square feet for the university. The Liberal and Creative Arts Building focuses on new media facilities as the institution drives towards modernizing the 20th Century-era campus. Along with media presentation and classrooms the building will create a professional television newsroom for students a new home for the student-run KSFS radio station and purpose-built audio recording studios.

The construction of a proposed auditorium building connected with the LCA building has not yet started though the land has been graded.

The building features a low-profile design by Mark Cavagnero wrapped with metal panels and floor-to-ceiling windows. The developers are expecting to receive LEED Gold certification once complete. The white-clad design has subtle solar shades protecting recessed windows. The modern facade stands in stark contrast with the Parkmerced neighborhood which has been largely unchanged since built in the 1950s.

Parkmerced will be the site of an 11.2 million square foot mixed-use redevelopment with as many as 8900 units at full buildout including replacing the existing 3221 units on-site. Masterplanning for Parkmerced is by SOM.

Then The Website Crashed,"The Small Business Administration yesterday launched with great fanfare a long awaited portal that would allow arts venues closed down by pandemic to apply for grant money to cover rent utilities insurance and other accumulated expenses. The site went live at noon but was wracked with so many technical issues that the SBA decided to shut the portal down indefinitely.

""After working with our vendors to address them as quickly as possible the SBA temporarily suspended the portal and will re-open it as soon as possible to ensure all applicants have fair and equal access"" the agency said in a statement. ""This decision was not made lightly as we understand the need to ensure critical assistance gets to you as swiftly as possible.""

Anyone who tried to log on to apply for grants when the portal first opened was met with different error messages at each step. The SBA clarified in a tweet that they did not accept any applications or distribute any funding.

Audrey Fix Schaefer is the communications director for the National Independent Venue Association which has been lobbying for support for small venues. She says that the program is a lifeline. ""We all want the SBA to be successful in providing desperately needed emergency relief ASAP.""

If so a free proxy service called TheOldNet brings back the beginning of the Internet by causing every web page you visit to be returned from a specific year between 1996 through 2012 rather than its current version.

A proxy server is an application or remote device that acts as an intermediary between your web browser and a website you would like to visit. Instead of your browser connecting directly to the site it sends the request to the proxy server that connects to the requested site on your behalf and sends back its response.

The TheOldNet proxy server does things differently by allowing you to specify a connection port between 1996 and 2012 representing the year you would like to display all web pages. This causes the proxy server to return archived copies of any site you visit from Archive.org for the specified year and the current month.

Once configured the web browser will display every website you browse to as it was in the specified year.

Using this service you can visit the first popular search engine Yahoo.com in all its 1996 glory before Google existed.

The first popular search engine Yahoo.com in 1996

If search engines are not your thing you can change the proxy port to 1997 and see how the Apple.com website looked in 1997 when you could preorder Mac OS 8 or learn more about the Apple eMate 300 personal digital assistant.

Apple.com as it looked in 1997

Maybe gaming is more your thing with Electronic Arts website from 1997.

Electronic arts (ea.com) website from 1997

Use the TheOldNet proxy service in Windows 10

To use TheOldNet you need to configure your web browser to use a proxy server which depending on the browser could be done in the browser's settings or via the operating system.

For example Chromium-based browsers on Windows do not use internal settings but instead rely on the operating system's proxy settin

Therefore to use TheOldNet on Windows 10 you need to click on the Start Menu search for proxy and then select the 'Proxy Settings' option.

Once the Proxy settings screen opens scroll down until you see Manual proxy setup and enable the 'Use a proxy server' setting.

Now enter theoldnet.com in the address field a port number between 1996 and 2012 (representing the year you wish to browse) and specify that you wish to not use the proxy server for 'web.archive.org' as shown below.

Windows 10 proxy settings

When done click on the Save button and Google Chrome will now be using Windows 10's configured proxy settings. If you configured the settings shown above any web page you visit would now be displayed as if it was 1996.

While using this service we recommend using it in incognito mode so that cookies for existing domains are not sent with requests to a website through the proxy. While there are no reports of malicious activity with TheOldNet it is always better to be safe than sorry.

When browsing the web you may find that websites do not exist which is likely because they actually didn't exist in that particular year. You can always change the port to a different year to find when the site went live.

TheOldNet is a fun service that allows you to get lost for hours as you see how websites looked in the past and the products and information they were offering at the time.

Be warned though as you use this service you will find it becomes a time sink as you get a sense of nostalgia for days gone by."

Early phase clinical trials conducted by researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center show promising results for patients with RET fusion-positive cancers high-grade (HGG) and low-grade glioma (LGG) and ovarian cancer.

The results presented today at the virtual American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2021 showcase the researchers’ ongoing efforts to advance clinical studies and expand potential indications of approved drugs to develop a platform for more effective treatments and to improve patient outcomes.

FDA-approved selpercatinib shows clinical benefits for RET fusion-positive cancers beyond lung and thyroid cancers (Abstract CT011)

Clinical trial results of RET kinase inhibitor selpercatinib show that the targeted therapy was effective in preventing or inhibiting the growth of tumors in RET fusion-positive cancers other than lung and thyroid cancers. The results derived from a cohort of patients enrolled in the phase 1/2 LIBRETTO-001 trial were presented by Vivek Subbiah M.D. associate professor of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics.

Selpercatinib became the first treatment approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat RET fusion-positive lung and thyroid cancers as well as RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in May 2020. However because RET alterations also have been shown to be oncogenic drivers in the pathogenesis of other cancers it was postulated that selpercatinib could be used to treat other advanced solid tumors in which RET alterations occur.

“Selpercatinib demonstrates promising activity across a variety of non-lung and non-thyroid RET fusion-positive advanced solid tumors including treatment-refractory GI malignancies” Subbiah said. “Although RET fusions are rare this undoubtedly has conferred clinical benefit and the gift of time to these patients.”

Thirty-two patients with RET fusion-positive non-lung or non-thyroid cancers participated in the study representing 12 unique tumor types — including pancreatic colon breast salivary sarcoma and pulmonary carcinosarcoma. Twenty-nine of the patients were previously treated with systemic therapy.

The objective response rate in this heavily pretreated patient population was 47% including complete responses observed in two patients. Responses were observed across nine unique cancer types and a spectrum of fusion partners. Responses were ongoing in 73% of the patients and the median duration of response was not reached at a follow-up of 13 months. The safety profile of this cohort is consistent with the known profile of selpercatinib in the overall LIBRETTO-001 population.

The LIBRETTO-001 trial which spans 16 countries and 89 sites continues to enroll patients with RET-altered non-lung cancer.

“These are definitely impactful data for precision oncology from the clinical and translational perspective” Subbiah emphasized. “These analyses reiterate the importance of broad-based genomic profiling to identify actionable oncogenic drivers including RET fusions.”

Combining dabrafenib and trametinib to treat BRAF V600E-mutant high-grade (HGG) and low-grade glioma (LGG) shows significant antitumor activity (Abstract CT025)

In a nonrandomized open-label phase 2 study MD Anderson researchers showed that the combination of BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and MEK inhibitor trametinib had promising efficacy in patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive HGG and LGG.

BRAF mutations occur in approximately 3% of glioblastomas and 15% of low-grade gliomas.

The FDA approved a combination therapy of BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and MEK inhibitor trametinib which blocks proteins that facilitate cancer cell growth to treat patients with BRAF V600-positive melanoma non-small cell lung carcinoma and anaplastic thyroid cancer.

“Glioblastoma is a very difficult-to-treat tumor and has historically shown resistance to therapies and this is the first time that a targeted therapy has shown significant activity in these challenging tumors” said Subbiah who presented these findings.

The HGG arm of the trial enrolled 45 patients previously treated with radiotherapy surgery or chemotherapy. A majority of patients had glioblastoma while the rest had anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma and anaplastic astrocytoma.

After undergoing the combination therapy patients showed a 33% objective response rate. The tumors continued to respond to treatment without cancer growth or spread for 36.9 months.

While 13 patients were enrolled in the LGG cohort eight patients — who were previously treated with surgery radiotherapy and chemotherapy — were evaluated in the study and achieved an objective response rate of 69%. The median duration of response median progression-free survival and median overall survival rates were not reached.

Among both cohorts 54 patients (93%) experienced a common adverse event — including fatigue headache nausea and fever — and 31 patients (53%) experienced a Grade 3 or greater adverse event — such as fatigue decreased neutrophil count headache and neutropenia. No new safety signals were detected.

Ultimately results from this basket trial show that dabrafenib combined with trametinib achieved meaningful response rates in patients with recurrent gliomas with BRAF V600E mutations regardless of glioma subtype.

“Molecular screening strategies that include BRAF V600E mutations will be crucial for identifying patients who may benefit from these therapies” Subbiah said. “We recommend that testing is adopted in clinical practice for patients with glioma.”

Newly discovered metabolic vulnerability may offer treatment strategy for certain patients with ovarian cancer (Abstract 87)

Researchers from MD Anderson’s Therapeutics Discovery division previously reported the discovery and development of IACS-6274 a novel small-molecule inhibitor targeting the metabolic enzyme glutaminase (GLS1). Through a patient-driven translational biology effort the researchers now have identified and validated asparagine synthetase (ASNS) as a candidate biomarker to predict those most likely to benefit from the therapy.

The new findings were shared in a minisymposium presentation by Nakia D. Spencer institute associate scientist IV with the Translational Research to Advance Therapeutics and Innovation in Oncology (TRACTION) platform and one of the GLS1 project leads.

The development of IACS-6274 previously known as IPN60090 was initiated and advanced by a team of scientists in the Institute for Applied Cancer Science (IACS) and TRACTION platforms both engines within Therapeutics Discovery. The drug is now under investigation in a Phase I trial for advanced solid tumors.

“Ovarian cancer remains an area of unmet medical need for our patients” Spencer said. “Utilizing team science to drive patient-focused research we discovered that ovarian tumors lacking ASNS respond to IACS-6274 treatment pointing us toward a significant number of patients who may benefit from this therapy.”

Disruptions in normal cellular metabolism are distinguishing characteristics of many cancers and the GLS1 enzyme is critical to many metabolic processes. In the preclinical development of IACS-6274 TRACTION researchers demonstrated promising activity in certain ovarian cancer preclinical models.

In ovarian cancer cell lines that respond to IACS-6274 treatment disrupts normal metabolism of specific amino acids and antioxidants resulting in the accumulation of DNA damage and inhibiting tumor growth. By comparing sensitive and resistant cell lines the researchers discovered that high expression of the metabolic enzyme ASNS predicted resistance to IACS-6274.

These results were confirmed in animal models where ovarian cancers with low ASNS expression were responsive to IACS-6274 treatment and those with high ASNS expression were not. Working with the Pathology and Laboratory Medicine division the team created a CLIA-certified assay to quantify ASNS levels in tumor samples.

“Advancing treatments that provide the greatest benefits to patients requires a strong translational and drug discovery package that complements the clinical efforts” Spencer said. “Applying what we are learning from our ongoing clinical study we continue to develop multiple biomarker-driven patient stratification strategies to identify those most likely to benefit from IACS-6274.”

Therapeutics Discovery researchers will share additional updates on IACS-6274 development in poster sessions including the identification of rational combination strategies for GLS1 inhibitors and the effects of IACS-6274 on the antitumor immune response.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8wNC8xMC9wZml6ZXJzLWJvc3MtdGhpbmtzLWNvdmlkLTE5LWlzLXJlc2hhcGluZy1iaWctcGhhcm1hLWZvci10aGUtYmV0dGVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer's boss thinks covid-19 is reshaping Big Pharma for the better,"“T HE IMPOSSIBLE can many times become possible” reflects Albert Bourla boss of Pfizer.

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term performance of a company's stock. The faster a company is growing the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Marsh & McLennan is 7.6% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in Insurance industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 6.9% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in Insurance industry.

Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months Marsh & McLennan's return on invested capital is 8.10 and its cost of capital is 6.31. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Marsh & McLennan is shown below:

G207 an immunotherapy derived from a modified herpes virus is well tolerated in children with gliomas and shows signs of clinical effectivenessA modified herpes virus alone and in combination with radiation has been shown to be well tolerated with early signs of clinical effectiveness in pediatric patients with high-grade brain tumors or gliomas according to findings from researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Children’s of Alabama. The findings were presented at the virtual American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting 2021 held April 10-15 and published online in the New England Journal of Medicine on April 10.

Brain tumors are the most common solid tumor in children and aggressive types like glioblastoma have an extremely low survival rate: as low as 10 percent five years after diagnosis. Even tumors successfully treated by surgery radiation and/or chemotherapy have a high recurrence rate.

“This is the first study utilizing delivery of a viral immunotherapy directly into the tumor of children with brain tumors and the results indicate the engineered herpes virus can be delivered safely into tumors located in all areas of the cerebrum in children” said Gregory Friedman M.D. professor in the Department of Pediatrics at UAB research scientist at the UAB O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center and director of developmental therapeutics for the Alabama Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Disorders at UAB and Children’s of Alabama. “The key findings thus far are that the approach is safe and well tolerable and the preliminary evidence of efficacy is promising.”

In the Phase 1 clinical trial of 12 patients between 7 and 18 years of age the investigators employed a modified virus known as G207 derived from the herpes virus responsible for cold sores. The virus is genetically altered so that it infects only tumor cells. When injected into a malignant brain tumor via a catheter the virus enters the tumor cells and replicates. This kills the cell and releases the virus’s progeny to hunt out other tumor cells. Additionally the virus induces a strong immune response by the body’s immune system which can attack the tumor. The trial tested G207 alone and then combined with a single low-dose of radiation designed to increase virus replication and spread throughout the tumor.

G207 is the product of more than 30 years of research. James Markert M.D. MPH chair of the UAB Department of Neurosurgery was part of the team at Massachusetts General Hospital in the early 1990’s that first developed the concept of using oncolytic herpes viruses. He worked on the parent virus for G207 and conducted the first clinical study of G207 at UAB. Today the use of viral therapies is under investigation for nearly every type of cancer.

Gregory Friedman M.D.A second-generation virus called M032 has been developed by Markert and collaborators Yancey Gillespie Ph.D. professor of neurosurgery and Richard Whitley M.D. Distinguished Professor of pediatric infectious disease and is in clinical trials at UAB in adults with glioblastoma. UAB investigator Renee Chambers DVM M.D. is using M032 in a study of brain tumors in dogs which can develop tumors very similar to those in humans.

In the current trial 11 of the 12 patients demonstrated a treatment response. The overall survival rate was more than double the typical survival rate for children with high-grade glioma. Some 36 percent of the patients thus far have survived longer than 18 months surpassing the medial overall survival for newly diagnosed patients with high-grade glioma.

Friedman’s team reports that G207 alone or in combination with radiation therapy was well tolerated with no serious adverse side effects attributed to the treatment.

“There are still more studies needed; but thus far viral immunotherapy with several different viruses including herpes virus has shown promise in treating high-grade brain tumors in both adults and children” Friedman said. “We also have an ongoing clinical trial to test the safety of G207 when delivered into the cerebellum an area of the brain that has not been tested before in adults or children but is the most common location for pediatric tumors to arise.”

Friedman says the next steps are to determine the ideal timing to treat patients and what therapies can be used with viral immunotherapy to maximize the anti-tumor immune response. Based on the encouraging Phase 1 trial results he and his team are working with the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium to develop a multi-institutional Phase 2 trial of G207 for progressive pediatric high-grade glioma which they hope to initiate later this year.

The study was supported by the United States Food and Drug Administration Orphan Products Clinical Trials Grants Program Cannonball Kids’ Cancer Foundation the Rally Foundation for Childhood Cancer Research Hyundai Hope on Wheels St. Baldrick’s Foundation and the Kaul Pediatric Research Institute. G207 was provided by Treovir LLC.

Friedman is supported in part by contracts between UAB and Eli Lilly and Co. and Pfizer. Markert and Whitley have financial interests in Treovir LLC which provided G207 for the trial. They were not involved in any aspect of the conduct or data analysis of the study.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9xdWVlbi1lbGl6YWJldGgtYW1hemluZy1mb2xsb3dpbmctcHJpbmNlLTE1MDAwMDI1My5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Queen Elizabeth 'Has Been Amazing' Following Prince Philip's Death Daughter-in-Law Sophie Says,"Queen Elizabeth's daughter-in-law Sophie Countess of Wessex is giving an update on how the monarch is coping following the death of her husband of 73 years Prince Philip.

NEW ORLEANS — A round of heavy storms overnight has knocked out power for thousands across southeast Louisiana including several thousand outages in New Orleans.

According to Entergy's outage map there are about 2400 people without power as of 5:45 a.m. in New Orleans. The outages appear to be clustered around two neighborhoods one in New Orleans East and the other in Algiers.

Tangipahoa and St. Charles parishes are both reporting large outages as well but it's unclear exactly how many Entergy customers are in the dark Saturday morning.

The heavy storms came through quickly dumping rain on the metro area along with high winds both of which are prone to cause outages.

Neighboring Jefferson Parish has only a handful of outages Saturday morning. East Baton Rouge Parish however appears to have had a rougher time with the storm. More than 16000 buildings are in the dark in the state capitol because of downed power lines according to Entergy.

While the wind threat is expected to subside as the morning continues street flooding remains a concern in Orleans Parish.

One of the more fascinating platform items of the Biden presidential campaign was the idea of transferring consumer credit ratings from Equifax (NYSE: EFX) Experian PLC (OTC: EXPGY) and TransUnion (NYSE: TRU) to a public registry under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

As reported by the Balance this idea was examined in depth in a paper published by a think tank called Demos in 2019. One major takeaway of that paper was that “decisions drawing on credit data reproduce and spread existing racial inequality making it harder to achieve true economic equity.” Demos proposed the idea of a public credit registry in that paper.

The CFPB has a new acting director Dave Uejio who recently replaced Trump appointee Kathleen Kraninger. In a CFPB blog post dated Jan. 28 Uejio stated his two main priorities would be “(1) relief for consumers facing hardship due to COVID-19 and the related economic crisis and (2) racial equity.” But nowhere does his statement specifically mention the idea of a public credit reporting agency.

Find: What Is Joe Biden Costing You This Week?

The three primary reporting agencies analyze consumer borrowing and repayment patterns. They assign scores that are then used to assess a person’s creditworthiness. This can affect their access to an apartment and their ability to hold certain jobs in addition to the amount they can borrow and the interest rates that they are charged. It’s big business — enough to support three public companies (although they have other businesses as well).

While lenders certainly have the right to determine the risk of a potential borrower the problem is the lack of transparency in the process. The three bureaus have slightly different calculation methods and data sources which can result in the same person having three very different credit scores. Some of the criteria seem unusual and can be gamed. For example it is better to have a high-limit credit card and only charge part of it than to charge the same amount on a low-limit credit card. Paying off a mortgage can reduce a credit score.

In addition errors are common but difficult to correct. There’s some evidence of racial biases as well which in turn affect access to housing certain jobs and credit. People have the right to free copies of their credit report once a year but have to pay beyond that.

Story continues

The Biden proposal would improve people’s access to their credit and may lead to standardized calculations. It could also lead to volatility if the criteria used changed with each presidential administration. There are also other credit bureaus out there that use different scoring criteria often used by lenders that work with customers who have bad credit. It’s unclear how this proposal would affect them.

PHOTO | COURTESY

Student housing is becoming a popular investment option among Nairobi tycoons who are increasingly teaming up with global venture capitalists to build hostels in strategic locations across the Kenyan capital.

Thanks to the rising number of scholars seeking higher education away from their rural homes there has been a growing shortage of student housing in Nairobi and other major towns of Kenya – a situation that has drawn the attention of property investors.

Armed with big money and well-crafted strategies the investors are building modern hostels near top colleges and universities with the hope of attracting thousands of students who are unable to find campus-based accommodation.

A group of city architects branding itself as Student Factory Africa Ltd. has for example joined forces with the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops and Betonbouw B – a Dutch private equity firm – to launch a multi-billion-shilling hostels project in Nairobi.

The Sh5 billion venture that is set commence this month will be located in Karen next to the Catholic University of Africa – whose students will be the key beneficiaries of the project.

Students from other neighbouring universities will also be permitted with every scholar expected to pay a rent of between Sh10000 and Sh18000 per month.

Branded hostels

Phase one of the 4500-bed hostel project is expected to be completed by May next year making it the country’s third branded student housing venture after Acorn Group’s Qwetu and Qejani hostels.

“These institutions have been asking for it and it is just that investors have not been able to tap into that market” Student Factory Africa’s CEO Chris Osore said during the signing of the deal with Betonbouw.

The equity firm will provide about 30% of the budget with the rest of financing coming from lenders. Student Factory is already in talks with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and other development finance institutions to unlock additional financing.

The project comes at a time when Acorn Group is pushing forward with plans to build 50000 units at student-rich areas of Madaraka Ruaraka Parklands Jogoo Road and Thome near USIU-Africa in Nairobi.

Acorn has completed several hostels in Baba Dogo Jogoo Parklands and Karen under the Qwetu brand with more facilities coming up in Thome and Chiromo under Qwetu and the low-cost Qejani brand.

University of Nairobi

Using the Qejani brand the company is building an 18-floor property hosting 704 units that will house 2112 students on a parcel of land on Science Crescent Road off Riverside Road in Nairobi. The facility targets students from the University of Nairobi’s Chiromo campus.

Close by a second building – a 16-floor property with 574 units – is set to come up under the premium Qwetu brand. It will host 837 students in single twin and cluster types of rooms.

Other investors involved in the student accommodation market include Questworks who are building 200 units (Parallelfour) in Madaraka and the Kenya Defense Forces Old Comrades Association who are putting up 500 units (Studyville) in the same estate.

Both hostels target scholars from Strathmore University.

Century Developments and Karumo have also signed a partnership deal to build 10000 student accommodation units in Kenya in the next five years.

Positive outlook

Analysts reckon that growth in the student housing market in Kenya will be spurred by a recent proliferation of both public and private universities that are unable to offer campus accommodation.

“Most universities are unable to house all their students” says John Waikwa who runs a private hostel in Nairobi West. “Developers are now splashing their cash on hostel projects.”

According to the ministry of education the available student housing in Kenya stands at an estimated 300000 units against a university enrolment of more than 500000 as at 2019 locking nearly half of the students’ population out of campus-based accommodation.

To solve the issue universities are engaging private investors to build hostels for their students in a Public Private Partnership (PPP) model where the investors will manage the facilities for several years to recoup their investments before transferring the hostels to the universities.

As of November 2020 12 companies have agreed to invest around 3.5 billion yuan (US$534 million) to set up factories.

The city is building a 10.22-sq km “Beauty and Healthcare Industrial Park” in the Baiyun district to generate synergies by bringing together local players in one location according to the Baiyun District Science Industry Commerce and Information Technology Bureau. Construction began earlier this year.

Guangzhou the capital of southern Chinese province of Guangdong  is stepping up efforts to catalyse the cosmetics and skincare industry and compete with brands from global leaders in the US$52 billion home market.

“The biggest challenge [for development of the local cosmetics and skincare industry] is the lack of land” Chen Wande office director of the bureau said in an interview. “So the city and the district created the park by buying land from villagers.”

The Park situated within the larger Guangzhou Private Science and Technology Park in the capital city is expected to generate 8.6 billion yuan worth of cosmetics and skincare products annually Chen added. Tourism leisure conferences and exhibitions will also be integrated in the park he added.

China’s retail sales value of cosmetics by wholesale and retail producers stood at 340 billion yuan in 2020 according to the National Bureau of Statistics up from 88.9 billion yuan in 2010. Globally L’Oreal Unilever and the Estee Lauder Cos together generated almost US$72 billion of sales in 2020 market data published by Statista said.

L’Oreal’s sales in mainland China grew by 27 per cent like-for-like and 24.1 per cent based on reported figures according to its 2020 annual report. The market recovered significantly in the second half growing around 4 per cent in the year boosted by strong omnichannel demand for selective brands and very dynamic e-commerce. L’Oréal China significantly outperformed the market with double-digit growth in all divisions it added.

Strengthening the “beauty economy” has become a key goal in recent years for Guangzhou the second largest economy in the Greater Bay Area . The Baiyun district which hosts about 75 per cent of such manufacturers in Guangzhou is expected to generate 50 billion yuan of output by 2023 and 100 billion yuan by 2025 the bureau forecasts.

To strengthen its traditional advantages in the industry authorities in Baiyun is also studying new policies to attract more investment and companies into the district and specifically in the Beauty and health care Industrial Park said Chen Guojin director of Guangzhou Baiyun Cosmetics Promotion Association. They will be announced progressively later this year he added.

The Guangdong provincial government meanwhile issued a proposal in January to facilitate the high-quality development of the cosmetics industry. It included measures ranging from facilitating the construction of related industrial parks preferential tax rates and actions to nurture local brands.

Zhongshan  Zhuhai and Dongguan .” “We hope the Park can coordinate resources in the Greater Bay Area and seek for co-development” said Chen at the association. “As Guangzhou is a top-tier city which has limited physical space the production and related facilities can be transferred to [other GBA cities such as] Foshanand.”

Sales of cosmetics and skincare products have been resilient in China through the coronavirus pandemic. They surged 40.7 per cent to 55.8 billion yuan in the first two months this year from a year earlier according to government data. It outpaced the 33.8 per cent headline growth in national retail sales.

As the demand for cosmetic products expands further in second- and third-tier mainland cities cosmetics retailing is expected to maintain its growth momentum in the near future. There’s also a strong tailwind in the men’s beauty-care segment.

From 2013 to 2018 the sales value of men’s grooming products in China increased by around 37 per cent.

“E-commerce and live streaming have motivated much consumption by the young people” said Chen of the association. “Through these methods people’s acknowledgement of beauty and cosmetics has also increased.”

A woman who makes rustic signs has gone viral after sharing the most embarrassing review she has ever received on Etsy as a customer spotted an unfortunate feature on her work

Woman mortified by Etsy review that points out awkward blunder on wall hanging

It's no secret that product reviews can sometimes be absolutely brutal but often they can also be the source of a good laugh.

One small business owner had people in stitches after sharing the 'most embarrassing' review her shop has ever received on Etsy.

Posting on TikTok Charlotte who runs Bohemian Forest Designs and makes rustic signs shared a snap of the review alongside footage of her looking mortified.

She captioned the clip: ""At least she still gave me five stars.""

The amusing review is for a Mother's Day Mama Bear Wood Slice Wall Hanging that costs £10.

It points out that there's a bit of an unfortunate flaw with the design as a knot in the wood is placed right on the bear's bottom.

The review reads: ""Loved my Mother's Day present but my daughter was very upset about what we are now affectionately calling 'butt hole bear'.

""It made me laugh but made her cry.

""Maybe consider tweaking the design so the central knot becomes a nose instead of... well you know what!""

Charlotte later did decide to take the customer's advice and change her design - though the old one is still available for anyone that wants it.

She added that she messaged the woman and offered her a free replacement as an apology.

The video quickly went viral being watched over 90000 times and garnering more than 11000 likes.

One person commented: ""OMG! I love that LOL! I would have gladly kept it and I'm glad the customer was in good spirits.""

Another said: ""That's a bonus honestly.""

A third wrote: ""This is hilarious. Awesome work btw. Refreshing to see something different on here.""

""Oops that's awesome"" proclaimed someone else. ""That's a family joke they'll be laughing at for a lifetime (once the girl gets over it) which is an awesome gift.""

A different user added: ""It's very cute. Plus it has character and it obviously gave the mum a giggle.""

An Etsy seller has shared a hilarious review left by a customer who felt it wise to point out that there was a slight flaw in the design of the product. She explains it in the clip below:

Charlotte who is based in Leicester specialises in rustic sign making and sells items via Etsy at BohemianForestDesign.

One product she offers is a 'Mother's Day Mama Bear wood slice wall hanging' which features a mother bear and her cub alongside a message that reads: ""Mum thanks for leading the way I love you.""

In a recent TikTok video Charlotte (@bohemianforestdesigns) shared a review she received last month from a woman who'd received the wall hanging as a Mother's Day present.

While she loved the item and gave it a five-star rating she also pointed out that there was a bit of a problem with the design - specifically the placement of the knot in the wood which just so happens to fall on the mother bear's backside.

In her video Charlotte said: ""Thinking about when I got the most embarrassing review on my Etsy shop.""

She then cut to the review which said: ""Loved my Mother's Day present but my daughter was very upset about what we are now affectionately calling 'butt hole bear'.

""It made me laugh but made her cry.

""Maybe consider tweaking the design so the central knot becomes a nose instead of... well you know what!""

In a later post Charlotte said she has since 'tweaked the design' so that the knot of the wood no longer falls in such an unfortunate place.

""I tweaked the design as I just couldn't unsee this"" she said.

""Better.""

The new design features the same mother and cub although this time the mother's rear sits slightly above the hole in the wood to avoid the whole 'butt hole bear' issue.

Charlotte's first video has racked up 96000 views and 11000 likes while her follow-up has had 121000 views and 13000 likes.

Some people commented to say the new version looks 'a lot better' with some saying the knot now looks like a 'tail'.

One person wrote: ""This is awesome. I'm so happy they were polite about it.""

But many others asked if the original was still available.

""I'm so glad they were polite but I kind of really want the old design"" one TikTok user said.

Advert

""I'm pleasantly surprised how many people said this"" Charlotte replied also saying to another: ""I'm keeping the other design for the people who like the old design.""

The amazing mission not only shows us what the alien terrain looks like but it also makes us wonder what other planets’ landscapes look like too—both in our solar system and beyond. Perhaps these dragon eggs by Australian artist Ben of Ben's Worx will spark your imagination. The handmade wood and resin sculptures look like they hold otherworldly mountainscapes and colorful galaxies within them.

Ben starts with dried pieces of burl wood that act as the eggs’ base. The natural contours of the timber look like rocky terrains already but their surfaces are brought to life with colorful layers of metallic ink and glitter. Next Ben places the wooden pieces into plastic cups and covers them with clear resin. Once cast and dry he cuts away the plastic and begins forming the perfect egg shape using a lathe.

When complete each handmade dragon egg sculpture looks like a prop from a fantasy film. Some pieces even feature tiny trees flowers and other elements within the resin making them appear as if they’re their own little ecosystem. It’s easy to imagine miniature alien life living in the glittering terrain.

Check out Ben’s dragon eggs below and buy your own from his collection on Etsy.

EG,Everest Re,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvdmVydWdieWxlYWd1ZS5jb20vcG9zdC9hbnRob255LW11bGxhbGx5LXRoZS10aG91Z2h0LW9mLXdpbm5pbmctYW5vdGhlci1ncmFuZC1maW5hbC1hZnRlci0yMDE3LXdhcy1saWtlLWV2ZXJlc3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Anthony Mullally: The thought of winning another Grand Final after 2017 was like Everest,"As we’re saying our goodbyes over Zoom Anthony Mullally has one small suggestion: “Maybe don’t make me look too crazy.”

Speaking from the south of France where he now plays his rugby in the Elite One Championship for Carcassonne Mullally makes for a fascinating interviewee. Over the course of an hour he speaks articulately and in detail about complex subjects such as mental health the environment and masculinity as well as a burgeoning interest in the 1960s psychedelic movement often ending his sprawling answers with a stereotypically northern bluntness: “So yeah that’s that.”

Forging a career in a game that is so often derided as parochial and claustrophobic the former Leeds prop has appeared for clubs in three separate continents and four different countries representing a fifth Ireland at World Cups home and abroad.

After leaving Toronto following their expulsion from Super League he spent his summer living in a camper van and surfing in Cornwall but laughs off comparisons to Alex Honnold the death-defying American rock climber whose own life living on four wheels is subject of the documentary Free Solo.

“I don’t know about that mate – I’m like a Smart Price version!” he says. “It’s always been the case: at heart I am Alex Honnold but I’m in a rugby player’s body. I’m like a nomad who plays rugby.”

Known as The Vegan Warrior on the pitch Mullally’s long locks create the illusion that Conan The Barbarian has been cast in This Sporting Life while his nickname also reflects his growing passion for sustainable living and reconnecting with the natural environment around him.

At a time when it’s easy to feel that the lunatics have taken over the asylum in society the line between madness and sanity is only becoming more blurred. Is Anthony Mullally crazy? Maybe. Is he unique? Undoubtedly.

The first steps on this unconventional path were taken when Mullally now 29 was still a teenager. Spending the 2011 season on loan at Brisbane Broncos’ Under-20s from Widnes Vikings he began the year “embarrassing himself” by making the most of the free drinks on offer at the club’s red-carpet season-launch party but ended his time in Australia with a month-long trip that gave him a taste for adventure which has only become more fevered.

“The contrasts in environments and cultures was a crazy change. It was amazing” he says. “I got my backpack and did some of the east coast. That kind of sparked it for me. I stayed in hostels and I always envied that freedom in the people I was seeing. That wanting to be free stayed in me that’s why in my off-seasons I’ve been to South America surfing in Central America Asia – I’ve always done quite big trips.”

First though he had to return to Widnes and establish himself as a Super League player. The early years of his career followed a recurring pattern. Loan spells in the Championship helped Mullally prove himself to both Widnes and latterly Huddersfield only for agreed transfers – first from Widnes to Huddersfield and then from the Giants to Leeds – meaning both clubs “got a bit funny” and sent him out on loan again.

Still he had shown enough promise to earn a move to a Leeds Rhinos side coming off the back of winning the treble in 2015. As much as the chance to win silverware was a driver behind the move Mullally is refreshingly honest when discussing another factor in his decision.

“I was living in Leeds and to be honest I was 24 and really liked that Headingley scene going out with the lads and getting drunk. It was probably an image thing if I’m looking back now wanting to go there and be like a Big Leeds Player. Obviously to win silverware but if I’m being honest it was an ego thing. I wanted people to see me and think ‘He plays for Leeds.’

“My agent just got on it. I said to him ‘Get me to Leeds’ and he did. They were interested don’t get me wrong but I’d been planting the seed for a while. I probably put myself on their radar with my keenness. That year I had a few good games against Leeds so that helped me as well.”

With the Rhinos Mullally first encountered life under head coach Brian McDermott whom he later reunited with at Toronto. Like Mullally McDermott is happy to think outside of the box and the player considers his former mentor a good friend. Their relationship however did not click immediately.

“What were my first impressions? Weirdo!” Mullally says. “He’s an interesting guy. Me and Macca are really good friends now we still speak. We’ve been through a lot together as a lot of players have with him.

“At first you just don’t know where you stand. You don’t know what’s going on and you have to prove yourself to him. Once you do that and do what he wants you to do everything is fine.”

He adds: “As an athlete I’ve got a lot of ability it’s just sometimes I only get the best out of me when I’m really motivated. He’s good at creating a story each week. He knows you can only focus on so many things each week so he really nails down on one point – that’s what he does really well. I’m hoping to see him coaching again soon.”

If Mullally joined Leeds to win trophies and enjoy the glamour of playing for a big club his first season at Headingley quickly brought him back down to Earth. A year on from their clean sweep of honours the Rhinos missed out on the play-offs and battled against relegation for much of 2016.

Mullally failed to find his best form. Looking back he now admits he was too quick to blame others rather than take responsibility for his own performances. Off the back of “some realisations of where I was and where I thought I was” he returned for pre-season ahead of the 2017 season with only one goal in mind: doing everything he possibly could to win the Super League title.

That target seemed ludicrous when Castleford Tigers inflicted a record 66-10 defeat on Leeds in the fourth game of the season but Mullally was one of the few Rhinos players to emerge from that game with any credit coming off the bench to inject some sorely lacking energy and physicality scoring a try.

From there his performances – and his hair – grew and grew as his barnstorming runs off the bench began to cement him as something of a cult hero on the terraces. The team’s collective performances also improved as Leeds gradually gathered momentum as the season went on.

Despite losing four times to runaway league leaders Castleford over the course of the regular season Leeds suffocated the Tigers in the Grand Final with a dominant 24-6 victory. Mullally had his winner’s ring. But just like his month travelling up and down Australia’s east coast it proved a catalyst for another change in mindset.

“I was just really determined. I wanted to win Super League. I wanted to play every week. I remember having this steely determination and drive – I probably used that up in that season” he laughs.

“It’s completely exhausting. I was speaking to Jamie Jones-Buchanan at the start of the 2018 pre-season and I said to him ‘How do you try to go again every year? The thought of trying to win this Grand Final now seems like Everest I just don’t have the motivation to do it.’

“Obviously Mac is like ‘Win again.’ He gets a lot of pressure from the top. At Leeds you win and you win again. You’ve got to keep winning. I’m not calling out Leeds I love the club but that’s the culture. They’ll tell you themselves they want to win every year. That’s completely fine if you want to do that but that’s not me.

“The whole thing was amazing I’m so glad I’ve done it but at the same time: I’ve done it now so I don’t have to do it again. I don’t want to do it again.

“That’s what put me on the trajectory of going more internally on what’s actually important and the fact we can’t put too much importance on achieving these external things to bring validation and fulfilment that we think we need. After the final I was like ‘Well what do I do now?’ That was my goal and dream. It sparked me onto a different path.”

In keeping with his “turbulent” time at Leeds the Rhinos once more went from one extreme to the other. Ravaged by injuries they spent the 2018 season looking over their shoulders in the league table. McDermott ultimately lost his job as head coach.

Mullally spent a period sidelined due to a head injury and admits he returned to action too early. As a result he struggled for confidence and form with incoming director of rugby Kevin Sinfield allowing him some time away from the club to clear his mind by surfing in Cornwall “although I couldn’t say that at the time!”

Mullally says: “Kev was really good he told me to come back when I’m right. I did but I just wasn’t playing well. I wasn’t in it emotionally physically. That was kind of the end. After that I came into pre-season and Kev told me I could look elsewhere.”

A reunion with Brian McDermott took Mullally on another adventure to Toronto Wolfpack dropping down a division to help the Canadian expansion side earn promotion from the Championship. He had heard rumours of wages getting paid late prior to signing and the pandemic proved the death knell for the Wolfpack after owner David Argyle said he could no longer fund the club prompting their withdrawal from Super League.

“It was always a bit dodgy you’d always get paid a few days late or a week late and stuff like that. We always kind of thought it would be OK. The Championship season was fine getting paid a little bit late here or there. We got into Super League and it was fine. Then COVID happened and we didn’t get paid one time for nearly two months. We got paid and then we didn’t get paid for nearly six months after that.

“It is what it is. We physically can’t control what happens to us all you can control in this universe of chaos is how we react. If I loosen my ideologies and pre-conceived notion of how things should be then you can more easily slip through the gaps and adapt and enjoy life without having the pitfalls. So that’s what I do mate. I didn’t get paid so I bought a van and moved down to Cornwall and lived there for four months working and surfing. It was probably the best summer I’ve had.”

Mullally made his latest move to Carcassonne in September. With more than his fair share of highs and lows in rugby league and a life philosophy that sees him look inward rather than outward for validation what does success look like for him at this stage of his career?

“Success for me is the measurement of how happy you are” he says. “If you’re content and happy then you’re successful. If you’ve got a roof over your head and food in your cupboards and you’re healthy in a healthy family then you’re successful. Anything above that is a luxury.

“Obviously I like more than that but what I like isn’t necessarily material-based. I like to surf I like to climb I like to be in nature. Success for me is how you align with your true purpose in a society that tries to tell you what your purpose is and what to follow. So if you deconstruct that and find out what your purpose is that’s success to me.”

Mullally plans to return to life in his van in Cornwall once the French season ends in the summer. In July he will host a Kudhva Retreat hoping to help men reconnect not only with nature but also with their own sense of masculinity rather than the unhealthy stereotypes still perpetuated in many parts of society. Across three days participants will take part in surfing lessons breathwork cold immersion and open group discussions.

“Masculinity is in itself an energy and it resides in us” Mullally says. “Obviously there’s a polarity between masculine and feminine and it’s about trying to get back to where you are in yours. There are traits to it; purpose integrity generativity – these are the things for me not dominance strength aggression.

“As well as the men’s work my purpose is to get back to nature declutter my mind declutter domestications of my mind from a young age break it down” – with that Mullally returns to his guiding principle since that trip to Australia a decade ago – “and just be free.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

On Saturday Green Team volunteers from the Hutchinson area built and installed a new sloped roof over a 20-foot by 20-foot structure so teachers will be able to hold class in an outdoor setting.

The structure is one of several parts that make up the classroom. In addition to Evergy's contribution the school used donations to construct fence portions around the patio as well as benches to go inside.

The team a group of employees and retiree volunteers ""that take on environmental projects across Kansas and Missouri since 1989"" according to the group.

Saturday's volunteers many of which work as linemen or have retired from Evergy used bucket trucks to reach the boards creating the roof.

Much of the lumber used to build the structure is reclaimed said Evergy Green Team Coordinator Jason Swartz.

Just remember that your self-storage tenants are still facing challenges including financial hardship.

Early in the pandemic you might’ve heard about government orders being passed including eviction moratoriums and foreclosure forbearance. As these measures are lifted that piper will need to be paid. Many of your customers will find themselves facing evictions or foreclosure claims for unpaid rent or mortgages which could easily reach many thousands of dollars. This is on top of deferred utility bills credit card payments and other financial obligations creditors haven’t been able to collect. As all this debt comes due your customers may not be able to pay what they owe which may lead them to file for bankruptcy.

If ever you are put on notice that a tenant of yours has filed for bankruptcy you must act appropriately to avoid legal risk. This article explains what you need to know about the filing and what actions you need to take.

Respect the Filing

The problem with bankruptcy law is it’s counterintuitive. What you may think would be right and fair is sometimes exactly the opposite. The law is written to protect the debtor not his creditors. It doesn’t matter if you disagree with that concept. A violation of a bankruptcy order can result in contempt of court. You could face paying damages to the debtor and even be forced to pay his attorney’s fees. Contempt-of-court orders could also include jail time!

It’s also important to know that you can be involved in a bankruptcy even if the debtor doesn’t owe you money at the time of filing. This happens because you can be listed in the bankruptcy petition for reasons other than being a creditor for example holding a security deposit.

In addition (and this is important): Just because you don’t receive formal written notice from the tenant or the court of a bankruptcy any oral or implied notice is good enough. At that point you must assume a bankruptcy has been filed and act in accordance with the rules. So if a tenant or someone who knows him tells you he has filed or plans to file—even if you haven’t received written notice—the burden shifts to you. You must determine whether this alleged filing is true before acting against your tenant or proceeding with collections.

Understand the Automatic Stay

The first concept you need to understand about bankruptcy is the automatic stay. As soon as a bankruptcy is filed with the court an automatic-stay order is issued without the judge even seeing the filing. This gives the debtor protections under bankruptcy law which provides that no creditor may take any action to collect a debt once the bankruptcy is filed. This is true even if you believe it’s filed in bad faith.

These actions include the commencement or continuation of any sort of judicial proceeding. In self-storage that would refer to sending bills late notices automatic texts imposition of additional fees lien notices or conducting lien sales or evictions. As soon as you believe or know a bankruptcy has been filed you must stop everything you’re doing to collect that tenant’s debt. This means halting all automatic services such as automated texts or calls lest you violate the automatic stay.

Get a Social Security Number

Tenant bankruptcy is one reasons why it’s so important for you to obtain the tenant’s Social Security number (SSN) at the time of rental. If ever he files for bankruptcy or alleges he has his SSN is the best way for you to confirm that. It allows your attorney to check the federal government’s court-docket system.

If a tenant says “I’m filing for bankruptcy” and you’re a couple days away from a lien sale you can use his SSN to verify that statement and know whether you need to stop the auction. Without this vital piece of information your hands are tied and you must stop just based on his word. Many tenants will tell a self-storage operator they’re going to file but don’t actually do it. Without the right information you’ll be stymied.

Find Out the Filing Type

Once you have word rumor notice or even innuendo of a bankruptcy it’s time to call your attorney. He’ll ask whether you know the chapter of bankruptcy filed.

Most bankruptcies involving your tenants are Chapter 7 which is an attempt to discharge all unsecured debt and even some secured debt. There’s also Chapter 13 sometimes known as a wage-earner plan whereby the bankruptcy runs for a period and the debtor pays off some or all the debt through garnishment of wages into a plan. If this is the case you’ll need to provide proof of claim to the court to participate. Chapter 11 is a business reorganization similar to a Chapter 13 but more suited for companies rather than individuals.

Work Your Remedy

One of the most common mistakes made by self-storage operators is trying to negotiate some sort of repayment of the past-due rent with the tenant after he files for bankruptcy with or without move-out. This violates the automatic-stay order!

Thankfully you do have a remedy. You don’t have to wait for months or years for the bankruptcy to resolve itself. Rather you can negotiate for the tenant to leave. To be safe your attorney should oversee these negotiations. If the tenant is unable or unwilling to vacate your attorney can file a motion for relief from the automatic stay which the court would be able to grant. This allows you the right to remove the tenant from your storage unit.

Understand though that this approach can be extremely complicated particularly with Chapter 11 bankruptcies. It’s become even more convoluted since the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) was passed in December. It seems to have extended the time for a lease rejection. Thus working with your attorney is exceptionally important.

The CAA also altered the rules for preferential payments which are those you may receive from your tenant before he files bankruptcy. If you plan to take payments from a customer in default speak to your attorney especially if you fear the tenant might file bankruptcy in the near future. Your legal representative can help you potentially avoid these monies being recouped under the new preference guidelines in the bankruptcy code.

Remember if the tenant isn’t going to pay you after filing bankruptcy have your attorney negotiate a move-out. This is your best remedy. Don’t allow a debtor who’s filed to simply remain in your space without payment just because you don’t understand your rights under the code.

Bankruptcy is a tricky area of the law. If you have a tenant who has or could file for bankruptcy don’t think you can handle it yourself. Contact your attorney and let him help you through this. It may cost you a few dollars but the representation will in this instance be well worth the legal fees.

Promise.

Before my husband and I moved in January our last apartment of four years was fully loaded...but not in a good way. You literally couldn't squeeze a toothpick into a drawer or closet without an explosion. We were an Amazon order away from utilizing the oven for sweater storage and the microwave for shoes.



So in our new place I wanted to focus on A) getting rid of all the useless sh*t we accumulated over the last four years and B) finding the best ways to utilize our new storage spaces!

It sounds simple but organizing your things in a way that's aesthetically pleasing and functional for your everyday needs is actually really hard! Before starting this journey I'd seen many organizational upgrades from the professionals at Imagine It Done a New York City-based organizing service and I knew I had to reach out for serious help!

Like everyone I needed a game plan that factored in my routines and life and alllllll of my things so hiring someone to teach me their ways (and also do the heavy lifting) seemed like a good idea.

We collaborated on the bathroom (Beauty products! Toiletries! Towels! UGH!) and my closet. Honestly I learned so much! Starting with a five-step process from Lisa Jacobs founder and CEO of Imagine It Dones. The steps: edit categorize contain curate and personalize.

Whether you can afford to hire a professional organizer (I was lucky to get Imagine It Done’s service fee comped for our collaboration) or just need a quarantine project here’s everything I learned about chic organization from the pros. Shall we?

1. Floating shelf shoe storage

If you have open wall space in your closet (or honestly wherever) add floating shelves immediately. You will thank me later! These create additional space for shoes and handbags. Bonus: Color-coding your shoes on the floating shelves creates a fun accent wall.

2. Nail polish wall organizer for sunglasses

If you’re the queen of breaking losing or just forgetting what sunglasses you own an acrylic nail polish wall display was basically made for you! This storage solution is chic and allows you to easily see what you own in the blink of an eye (heh). Bonus if you have extra room you can also utilize the space to store perfumes.

Get the look



3. Expandable drawer dividers for ev-er-ything

I’m not quite sure how I lived my first 30 years of life without drawer dividers. Yes these literally allow you to create compartments or zones within your drawers. Essentially turning one drawer into two or even... THREE!

Get the look

4. Matching baskets or bins for clothing and accessories storage



These are a must for storing linens and seasonal clothing (or literally anything). They minimize clutter and keeps everything in one place. Plus wicker or metallic baskets can really elevate your space. Additionally adding labels with bin clips will remind you what is stored in each basket especially if your bins are stored above eye-level. Jacobs says ""The overall aesthetic is the most important factor in considering function for day-to-day living. If you see what you have you know what you have—make sure to label bins if you cannot see the contents.""

5. A step ladder for high shelves

My apartment has very high ceilings (not complaining!) which means some shelving and storage are out of reach. We have a ladder that was left by the previous tenant of the apartment but pulling it out of the closet was not convenient. The Imagine it done team recommended this beautiful Hasegawa step ladder in white and I highly recommend it for anyone who needs to reach things in high places on a regular basis. I love that it stands on its own it's lightweight and looks like it's part of our space. This specific ladder comes in different colors which can add a fun poppy design moment.

6. Matching hangers for your closet

Before reorganizing my closet my hanger collection looked like a group of distant cousins three times removed. Having a uniform set of hangers like non-slip or acrylic streamlines the look of your space while also maximizing the room you do have especially if you’re still using those bulky plastic or wood hangers.

7. Acrylic holders for purses clutches



My bags were falling on top of each and this handy acrylic organizer with individual compartments prevents exactly that from happening. It’s also aesthetically pleasing and acts as a great design moment in your space.

8. Folding boards...for folding



These are the magical unicorn of closet hacks—trust me. They have changed my life! These save soooooo much space by keeping clothes uniformly folded which makes your drawers and closets feel bigger. Additionally they prevent your clothes from wrinkling. Genius!

Get the look

9. Dividers for shelves





These are my favorite purchase of 2021. Shelf dividers keep your perfectly folded clothing piles (via your new folding boards <3) in perfectly folded piles. They are also great for managing bulkier items like sweaters and jeans. A true closet miracle!!!

10. Command hooks for hat storage

Command hooks are great for hat storage because they help preserve the shape of your hats (important!) while showcasing them in an elevated way.

Get the look

11. Stuffers for boots

Boot stuffers also help maintain the shape of your boots and keep them from falling on top of each other. The result is an aesthetically attractive look for your shoe display!

12. Shoe space savers for... saving space!

If you have lots of shoes like me or limited closet space in general these maximize storage space and prevent your shoes from smooshing each other.

Get the look

13. Drawers for accessories

I thought there was no good way to store belts and accessories so that they're easily accessible and look pretty. But I was wrong! Acrylic drawers are perfect for accessory storage since you can see exactly what you have within arm's reach.

14. Drawer organizers for jewelry

Acrylic drawer organizers are an absolute must! I use these inside my acrylic drawers to organize individual pieces of jewelry by category. For example I have one for everyday necklaces one for rings and another for earrings.

15. Hanging organizers for jewelry

If you have tons of jewelry like me a hanging jewelry organizer will save your life! I love that it also utilizes the open space on your door which for many people often goes unused.

16. Stackable bins for hair tools and beauty products

These are the best storage hack for keeping clothing accessories and toiletries organized while still being able to see what you own.

17. Turntables for toiletry storage

These are especially great if your bathroom shelving is really deep like mine they allow you to see your skincare products without them getting hidden in the back of the shelf.

18. Three-tier shelf for bathroom storage

Adding tiered shelving to your bathroom counters is one of my favorite hacks for makeup and skincare product organization! It lifts products off the surface creating space for additional storage.

19. Lipstick organizer to... store lipsticks!

I literally own 200 lipsticks but was using one before I bought the acrylic lipstick organizer. This storage hack allows you to slot each lipstick into a designated compartment so you can see everything you own!

20. Rolling cart for extra bathroom storage

We had a space underneath our sink in the bathroom that was not being utilized so I purchased a cart to store everyday products for easy access. I love how chic the cart looks in our bathroom and if you're like me and have tons of make-up and beauty products this storage solution makes the every day products super easy to find!

Get the look

21. Shower caddy for product organization

There are pros and cons to every small apartment. One of the cons for me is that my new apartment doesn't have a bathtub so there's no ledge or storage space for shampoo conditioner soap etc. Instead of keeping everything on the floor I bought this standing adjustable shower caddy—and it's been absolutely life changing. It keeps all our products off the ground and organized to perfection.

Get the look

22. High design hamper for those sweaty workout clothes!

It can be hard to justify utilizing precious space on a hamper. For years I threw the dirty laundry in laundry bags smushed at the bottom of my closet. But not anymore my friends! I now have a beautiful hamper that adds an elevated look to my space and keeps my dirty clothes off the ground and the bottom of my closet space free.

Special to USA TODAY

The Start menu is a Windows mainstay introduced with Windows 95. If you want to find a file launch an app or put your PC to sleep it’s your go-to spot.

For a lot of tasks you can also use handy keyboard shortcuts to get the basics done. Try Windows + L next time you get up from your computer to lock it without clicking through menus. Tap or click here for a guide to all the best PC shortcuts.

Now let's talk about junk. If you've had your computer for a long time it’s probably full of files you don’t need. Tap or click for a few simple ways to clear up storage space.

You can clear out the Start menu too. Here’s how:

1. Get rid of annoying suggestions

Have you noticed suggested links popping up when you open the Start menu? Windows shows recommended apps links it thinks you may find helpful.

If you’re tired of seeing these suggestions you can turn them off so they aren’t cluttering up your Start menu anymore:

• Click the Start menu > Settings icon

• Click Personalization

• Click Start on the left-hand side of the pane

• Toggle the slider off to disable “Show suggestions occasionally in Start”

2. Simplify the app list

It's annoying when the app you're looking for is hidden among many others you don't use. You have a couple of options for banishing the clutter.

To hide the apps list in the Start menu:

• Again navigate to Settings > Personalization > Start

• From here toggle “Show app list in Start menu” off

If you realize there are apps you don't want anymore remove them:

• Log in to your computer as an administrator

• Type Apps into the search box

• Under the search results select Apps & Features

• Select an application you want to remove

• Tap Uninstall

• Repeat the process for each application you want to remove

3. Disable options you don’t use

By default the Windows 10 Start menu shows you things like recently added or your most-used apps. Seeing new apps you’ve added in recent weeks can be helpful initially but you may not find that feature especially useful over time.

To disable the other options in Windows 10:

• Navigate to Settings > Personalization > Start

• Toggle the “Show most used apps” feature off

• You can also toggle off “Show recently added apps” in this section if you don’t want all your newly-installed applications to show up

4. Organize tiles to your liking

Start tiles are large bright boxes that give you quick access to certain apps. Not everyone likes being greeted by a load of square tiles with quick access to the Microsoft Store or the calendar when logging in.

If you prefer to go without the tiles built into Windows 10 you can turn them off. It’s easy to do too. Note: You must be signed in as an administrator to enable or disable the “Show more tiles on Start” setting.

• Navigate to Settings > Personalization > Start

• Toggle “Show more tiles on Start” off

To rearrange or organize the tiles on Start:

• Click the Windows button in the lower-left corner

• To move a tile click and drag it where you want it to go

5. Choose which folders appear

Three folders populate the Start Menu by default: Documents Pictures and Settings.

You can add additional folders to the mix alongside the defaults. Maybe you want to add File Explorer Downloads Music Videos Network or even a personal folder.

You’ll have to work within the Start menu screen’s height constraints but you can customize what folders appear as often as you like.

To add edit or remove folders from the Start Menu:

• Navigate to Settings > Personalization > Start

• Click Choose which folders appear on Start at the bottom of the menu

• You will see a list of folder options

• From here toggle them on or off depending on your preferences

Voilà! Your Start menu is exactly the way you want it.

The map of the northern segment of the Ontario Line published by Metrolinx in their October 2020 blog article has been added for reference. Scroll down to the end of the article.

Metrolinx has unveiled a plan for the Ontario Line’s Maintenance and Storage Facility north of Thorncliffe Park. Because of the local terrain green space and the Hydro corridor (not shown on the map below) this is split into three distinct sections:

The main buildings are west of Beth Nealson Drive north of the Don River.

Some servicing areas are in a long spur parallel to the CPR corridor. This will also be the location of a delivery track where vehicles will arrive from the manufacturer.

The storage yard will be in an area now occupied by various shops and offices as well as a mosque.

Here is a satellite view from Google Maps rotated to match the orientation of the map above.

The area to be occupied by the yard at the north end of Thorncliffe Park Drive West is shown below. This was taken before the Costco building went up on the vacant land in the upper right of the photo. The Ontario line will run north from Overlea Boulevard along the west edge of this property.

According to the Metrolinx Blog article on this plan the site was chosen from a list of nine. Metrolinx has not published the other locations that were considered.

The work we did to identify the best site for the MSF and yard will be pulled together as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report that will be available in 2022. We can let you know we looked at land near the western terminus at Exhibition all the way to the east and to the northern end of the alignment. A list of nine sites were brought forward for more detailed analysis some of which were ruled out because they weren’t big enough or they affected too many businesses and jobs. The site in the southeast portion of the Leaside Business Park was selected because our studies showed that it keeps impacts to the local community to a minimum while meeting all of the needs for the project: • it is already zoned for industrial use; • it is close to the main line making it quick and easy for trains to go in and out of service; • it is large enough to meet future needs; • it minimizes community impacts; • has less individual job impacts. Email from Metrolinx Media Relations April 9 2021

While the northern portion that will house the main buildings might only displace a self-storage farm the southern portion where the yard will be located sits on top of buildings that are an integral part of the Thorncliffe Park community. What the reaction will be might be gauged at an online meeting to be held on April 15 2021 at 6:30 pm.

Updated April 12 2021 at 9:30 pm:

When Metrolinx announced their revised route through Thorncliffe Park in October 2020 they touted the fact that this would avoid disruption of buildings such as the Macedonian Orthodox Cathedral. The map of the revised route is below.

Note the area labelled “MSF Study Area”. This is the location in the updated plan for the Operation and Maintenance building. The area at the north end of Thorncliffe Park Drive West is not touched by the line and there would be no reason for anyone to raise flags about the businesses and institutions already there.

The yard which is now part of the complex is completely new and there was no advance indication that this would be part of the design.

On a related note one of the comments below from Simon Hirst suggests that an alternate location might be the land on the other side of the CPR corridor now occupied by a gravel and cement company. This is visible as a white patch directly above the “MSF Study Area” in the Metrolinx map above (where “north” is to the right and “west” is up) and in the view below which is a closer view of the same area in the usual geographic orientation.

Source: Google Maps

If that area were to be used a connection tunnel would have to go under the CPR to link with the Ontario Line whose main shops and offices would be where the brown-roofed buildings labelled “Toronto Moving and Storage” are in the upper right of the photo.

Last week’s column explained the enigma of on the one hand repeated striking downward revisions to Guyana’s expected real GDP growth for 2020 (initially set at 85% by the IMF and Government of Guyana GoG in Q4 2019). And on the other ending the year with measured rates of 8.1 percent (IMF) and 45.1 percent (GoG). These later rates are still among the highest globally and doubly significant in a year when only a handful of countries enjoyed positive growth! The explanation for this enigma I believe lies in the world class of Guyana discoveries. As a result one notes also that despite the major setbacks endured in 2020 the ExxonMobil and partners’ industry target of 750000 barrels of crude oil per day is expected to be achieved comfortably. The same explanation applies.

As a consequence today’s column offers a summary recap of why Guyana’s finds are of world class petroleum potential.

World Class Potential

Up to date reported estimates of Guyana’s recoverable oil and gas resources operated on by ExxonMobil and partners stands at approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BoE). There were 18 discoveries as listed in Schedule 1 which follows:

In addition two other joint venture groupings (JVs) namely 1) Tullow lead Operator Total and Eco-Atlantic and 2) Repsol lead Operator Tullow and Total have announced three prospective finds in 2020 based on commissioned Prospective Resource Estimates totaling about 6 billion BoE for their best estimate. These finds were found in the Jethro 1 and Joe 1 wells for the first JV and the Carapa well for the second JV. These estimates are provided in updated commissioned studies. These data are reproduced in Schedule 2 below. Note these finds are located outside the Stabroek Block in the Orinduik and Kanuku blocks.

Further to this two months ago CGX Energy and Frontera Energy another JV announced a Competent Persons Report on prospective resources of 4.84 billion BOE best estimate. This was produced by Mc Daniel and Associates Consultants Ltd. The finds were also located outside the Stabroek block. This time in the Corentyne and Demerara blocks. Details indicate most of the prospective resources are located in the Corentyne block and only 525 million barrels in the Demerara block. The JV hopes to drill 32 prospects this year 27 in Corentyne and five in Demerara with CGX the Operator

Companies and blocks

To date there are 15 reported international oil companies operating in Guyana; namely ExxonMobil CNOOC Nexen Hess operating in Stabroek block; Repsol Tullow Total operating in Kanuku block; Anadarko operating in Roraima block; CGX Frontera operating in Corentyne and Demerara block; Tullow Total Eco- Atlantic operating in Orinduik block; ExxonMobil Ratio Hess Cataleya operating in Kaieteur block ExxonMobil Mid- Atlantic JHI operating in Canje block. There are 8 blocks in play. These data are summarized in Schedule 3 below

It is apt to note that when Exxon and partners had reported its first discovery back in 2016 it was only for an amount which was less than one billion barrels of oil equivalent BoE. In the face of this I had boldly predicted that Guyana’s discoveries would eventually reach at least 13 to 15 billion BoE. That prediction was not a hunch nor was it based on “guesswork” “gut feelings” or indeed “intuition”. In truth it was based on two lines of reasoning which flowed from my desk research into Guyana’s energy potential during 2015. The first of these was termed the “Atlantic mirror image” geological principle. And the second was based on United States Geological Service USGS Fact Sheets released in 2000 and 2012.

As regards the latter I hasten to remind readers that previously I had indicated the USGS Survey assessments had been conducted as a subset of the USGS’ World Assessments. Further the natural gas estimates are reported in cubic feet and natural gas liquids in BoE. The standard conversion ratio of natural gas to BoE is 6000 cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to one BoE.

Conclusion

Next week’s column will summarily recap the details that lead to the reasoning which underpins my persistently bullish outlook on Guyana’s oil and gas resource potential",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8xMS9uZXdzL2d1eWFuYS91Zy1sYXVuY2hlcy16b29tLXJvb21zLXRvLWVuaGFuY2UtdmlydHVhbC1jbGFzc2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UG launches Zoom Rooms to enhance virtual classes,"The University of Guyana (UG) has launched 18 Zoom Rooms to enhance virtual classroom experiences for its students and staff.

A brief ribbon cutting ceremony was held at the UG Centre for Information Technology (CIT) building at the Turkeyen Campus for the Zoom Rooms or technology rooms which were developed as part of the Greater Guyana Initiative of the Stabroek Block co-venturers ExxonMobil Hess and CNOOC Limited.

The 18 Zoom Rooms which cost approximately US$85000 is anchored at the CIT and linked to the Tain Campus and will connect persons attached to the university with access to lectures and laboratories whether they are on the campuses or elsewhere.

UG Vice-Chancellor Dr. Paloma Mohamed-Martin told Sunday Stabroek that US$70000 was given by the co-venturers and the university added about US$15000 which collectively covered the infrastructure costs.

According to the Vice-Chancellor talks about making the rooms a reality started in August 2019 but the plans were interrupted when the pandemic hit. However she said that the pandemic boosted the idea to have added rooms rather than just one which was being considered in the beginning. “It was initially meant for one information room to facilitate the higher education for our staff who are doing high degrees and working with lecturers at universities across the world and when COVID hit and we encountered these problems we passed the project and decided instead of one information room we did 18” she explained.

She said immediately 750 students would benefit from the initiative. “In the past we couldn’t get to all of those because we didn’t have space but now we could be at this campus and reach students in Anna Regina and Mabaruma and other parts that have access to internet. It makes a difference.”

A demonstration of how the rooms operate was conducted by Director of the university’s Tactical Online Services Unit Malcolm Williams. He briefly explained that with this technology lecturers can be in their labs or lecture room and easily connect to their learners who may be at home but still get to see exhibits in real time as would happen during face-to-face lectures. During his demonstration he also noted that work which would be written onto the whiteboards will be completely visible to the classroom through the camera. Zoom-ins will also allow for learners to get a better view of the environment around the lecturer.

Mohamed-Martin further noted that the project has prompted discussions about how flexible virtual classes are especially for when the University re-opens for face-to-face teaching. “Whenever we come back because we still can’t be this close and packed up in a classroom we envision students can stay in their homes or where ever they are or even on campus in some of the gardens; if they are working they can even be in a space in their office. It gives a huge amount of flexibility once everything works” the Vice-Chancellor posited. She added that this opportunity was probably considered in the past but added that it takes a team to plan and efficiently carry such a project that works. She added that seeing this project in action changes the delivery of education and the way the university works.

Having such technological options Mohamed said has broadened the spectrum for student applications. She stated that the university is now considering ways to carry out virtual classrooms which can be accessible to students who want to study at the university but are living in other countries. “We are looking at students out of Guyana because it gives an opportunity for us to teach people from the Caribbean region and from other parts of the world” She suggested that with the competitive fee structure offered at UG persons would be delighted to join. “We are really rejigging our entire offerings right now. It should be very exciting when you see us emerge in the next couple months.”

The GGI is a 10-year commitment implemented by the co-venturers in offshore oil development in the Stabroek Block of more than G$20 billion (US$100 million) which is to be used to significantly expand capacity building efforts and promote sustainable economic development in Guyana.

Allistair Routledge President of ExxonMobil Guyana shared that the company is excited to continue with venturing into projects which will benefit the country. He explained that ExxonMobil has committed to the Greater Guyana Initiative and the oil company is very happy to be a part of the project. “We are very happy to help the resource in the country. We also believe that with this comes an obligation to not only help through revenue but through energies and bring other benefits to the country and to the world.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZnJlc2hhbmdsZW5nLmNvbS8xNTAyNi9rb21vbGFmZS1tZWV0cy1vaWwtcHJvZHVjZXJzJUMzJUEyJUUyJTgyJUFDJUUyJTg0JUEyLWdyb3VwLS1zZWVrcy1zdXBwb3J0LW9uLXBpYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Komolafe Meets Oil Producers' Group Seeks Support on PIA- Freshangle News,"The Chief Executive Officer of the newly-created Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission NUPRC Mr. Gbenga Komolafe on Wednesday November 3 met with the Oil Producers Trade Section OPTS to solicit their support for the smooth implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act PIA.

Speaking during the maiden meeting with the top oil producers comprising 29 major players in Nigeria’s oil and gas sector in Lagos Komolafe noted that the OPTS remained a critical stakeholder and partner in the development and operations of upstream assets in the industry.

Some of those present at the meeting were: The Chairman OPTS and Managing Director Chevron Nigeria Mr. Rick Kennedy; Country Chair Shell Companies in Nigeria Mr. Osagie Okunbor and Managing Director TotalEnergies Nigeria Mr. Mike Sangster.

Others included the Managing Director ExxonMobil Nigeria Limited Mr. Richard Laing and Managing Director ENI Companies in Nigeria Mr. Roberto Daniele.

At the event Komolafe recalled that the NUPRC was established following the signing of the PIA by President Muhammadu Buhari on August 16 and was aimed at optimising the sector’s contribution to national development.

“The implementation of the PIA is very germane to the president and this current administration and he has given us a period of six to 12 months to begin to deliver some of the key deliverables.

“It is against this backdrop that I have decided to host this meeting in Lagos to reinforce my acknowledgment of your association and to solicit your collaboration as industry stakeholders” Komolafe said.

He noted that the meeting was coming at a critical time when the clamour from the global community was focused on energy transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy which has resulted in funding challenges for exploration activities by the oil companies.

Our Energy Correspondent National reports that he said the meeting was to familiarise the commission with the OPTS members and listen to the challenges hindering optimisation of key areas in the upstream sector.

“Permit me also to say that this is the first in the series of engagements with you as our vision is to build a 21st century regulator that will be fair just and be a critical business enabler in the upstream petroleum sector.

“It is in this wise that we urge you all to join hands with us in building confidence in the industry for robust investment” Komolafe said.

Earlier Kennedy while congratulating Komolafe on his appointment assured him of the support and cooperation of the OPTS in achieving the mandate of the commission adding that the establishment of the commission forms a major milestone in the reforms being made in the Nigeria’s petroleum sector.

While stressing that the passage of the PIA remains a milestone he however noted that the OPTS would need collaboration with the commission regarding some of the key timelines in the implementation of the PIA.

Kennedy said the areas included incorporation of the development trusts for host communities installation of flare meters as well as in the area of gas flare monetisation plan.

The Chevron Nigeria chief executive listed some of the challenges faced by the companies as high operating cost security lengthy contract cycle multiple levies and taxes among others.

A statement from UG noted that the initiative is the first building blocks of its blended-learning architecture which is preparing for the impending future and begins to fulfill the first aspirational goal of producing at least one graduate per Guyanese household.

The project will also enable the expansion of the university courses across the country without students physically attending classes.

Additionally tertiary learning is now made easier under the global COVID-19 pandemic.

A total of 18 zoom rooms will service 18 different locations across the university’s nine campuses in Georgetown Linden Berbice Bartica and Anna Regina enabling live classrooms to be broadcast to anywhere with a strong internet connection.

The initiative is part of a gift under the Stabroek Block Co-venturers Greater Guyana Initiative (GGI) to the tune of US$70000.

Attending the launch virtually was UG Chancellor Professor Edward Greene who congratulated the UG team for conceptualising and executing the highly complex technical project.

Professor Greene further noted that the Zoom Rooms are a critical and dynamic tool for enhancing the conferencing and blended learning operations for UG and expressed appreciation to ExxonMobil Guyana and partners for supporting the initiative.

Additionally UG Vice-Chancellor Professor Paloma Mohamed-Martin during brief remarks explained that the original mission of the project when it was first negotiated by the Office of Philanthropy and Civic Engagement (PACE) in 2019 was to establish a digital information room to serve as a central space and operations centre to facilitate local and international teleconferencing meetings virtual classrooms instructed from universities outside of Guyana and a data bank facility and was intended to cater for 30 persons per session.

However Professor Mohamed-Martin revealed that in 2020 the university’s vision was modified in response to the needs created by extended COVID-19 pandemic the funds were repurposed and the project re-designed to create 18 Zoom Rooms across the University of Guyana system.

Professor Mohamed-Martin further stated that one of the challenges in higher education across the world is how to manage courses online that have a practical component to it. However she highlighted that one innovative way the university is using the technology is to place the facility in labs so that during periods requiring distancing students who are out of the labs can still be remotely immersed in the process and still also benefit from what is happening."

Where there's a little bit of a tree of a tree sticking up and everything's demolished.""

Twenty-five years later those are the words former Oakfield Village President Tony O'Malley uses to describe the chaos left behind by the last F-5 tornado to strike the state of Wisconsin.

On July 18 1996 the small Fond du Lac county community found itself square in the sites of this tornado.

Former village fire chief Gary Cillien had to watch as the tornado tore apart his town. Also a trained storm spotter was north of town keeping eye out for any severe weather.

""Biggest thing I couldn't realize how much damage it was really doing. You see pictures after the fact but it was hard to imagine really what happened to our village"" Cillien said.



Thankfully his view of the tornado allowed the Oakfield village sirens to sound before the tornado struck.

In the village those sirens drew Elmer Held's attention and he couldn't believe what he saw out his front door.

""Looked to the west and this great big flat cloud was moving toward town. On the outside of the cloud these birds were flying. And the more I looked at it it wasn't birds. It was pieces of sheet metal and roofing from Prairie Dairy. At that point I said we better go in the basement"" remembers Elmer.



His wife Etta has been collecting photos of the event over the years. They include the photos of the tornado itself in the gallery above never published before as the twister swept Oakfield into the air.





Though Elmer hadn't actually seen birds swirling around earlier in the day Etta recalls hearing them later that night.

""The birds during the night they just kept on chirping. It was just like they did not have their home either"" recalls Etta.



The trees those birds had called home -- Oakfield's eponymous oak trees -- still aren't quite as tall where the tornado swept through.

Al Messner is part of Oakfield's historical society and says replanting those trees was a big deal to the community.

""The village did not look like Oakfield anymore"" Messner said. ""We did form a tree council and the tree council planted hundreds of trees in the village. So when you drive around the village now what you see is mostly trees planted by the tree council.""







Incredibly despite the destruction nobody was killed in Oakfield or the surrounding communities by the F-5.



Former Oakfield schools superintendent Joe Heinzelman says that can't be emphasized enough.

""We'd always say well no one was killed. That was a big anchor point for us also. Things can be replaced people can't. That all made a difference in how we recovered I believe"" Heinzelman said.



And while emotional scars can last a long time they do fade slowly but surely.

For Tony O'Malley it took more than a decade.

""It was probably about thirteen or fourteen years after the tornado and I'm at the ballpark I'm watching my son play baseball. Someone mentioned isn't this the July 18th? The anniversary of the tornado? And it was the first time in years that July 18th came around that I didn't think about it. And I kind of thought that was a good thing to put that behind and not be thinking about it every July 18th.""

Greg and Lisa Wilson raised their two boys at the house on North Ruston Avenue.

Kids hung out there after school in those relaxed childhood years.

In more recent times Greg would head out from that block with his neighbor to go golfing.

For 33 years it was a home for the Wilsons. It isn’t anymore.

Tucson is once again in dizzy days of upward spiraling real estate prices. The median sale price of existing homes rose by 15% from February 2020 to February 2021 according to R.L. Brown Reports.

It’s a flush period for people who have property to sell or can take part in sales. Money is rushing into the market in the pockets of migrants from other parts of the country flippers and investors. Buyers end up offering $10000 $20000 even $50000 more than the asking price. Some are even waiving the inspection.

The last time this happened back in 2004-2006 it ended with a crash. Experts say that’s unlikely to happen this time because there aren’t so many financially unqualified buyers as in the previous run-up and because interest rates are so low among other reasons.

But even if there’s no crash there will be victims. There already have been.

Most of them are normal Tucsonans priced out of buying a house in their hometown. That’s an especially hard situation now because rents are also soaring. If you can’t afford to buy that doesn’t mean you can afford to rent.

Others are like Greg and Lisa Wilson. Their 1958 home a modest 1545 square feet became another financial opportunity in the rush to profit off the surging market. That led to tragedy and further avoidable victimization.

It’s all because a home loses its meaning as a family place and transforms into a profit vehicle in boom times.

A neighborhood dad

Greg Wilson was a sort of father figure to kids growing up in the neighborhood known as Thunderbird Heights/Wilmot Desert Estates.

It turns out a soccer-playing friend of mine Don Tocci also lives on North Ruston Avenue across from the Wilsons’ place.

Tocci told me his younger son spent more time at the Wilsons’ home than at his own home. Greg Wilson coached baseball flag football and basketball teams.

After the kids were grown up the two neighbors golfed together three times a week.

Nobody outside the family would have known that the Wilsons weren’t the actual owners of the home where they lived. Greg Wilson’s parents were but it didn’t matter — till this year.

With real estate prices soaring and Greg’s mother widowed and growing old things changed quickly in January.

A family member who Greg is estranged from had power of attorney for Greg’s mother. That month he sold the house quickly for a very cheap price. A company that flips houses in Tucson First Federal LLC bought it for $140000.

That’s not only below market value but below the full cash value established by the County Assessor’s Office $169838. Zillow’s rough “Zestimate” an automated valuation based on sales in the area puts the value of the home at $245436 right now. The real value is probably somewhere in between.

After the initial publication of this column relatives of Wilson contacted the Star and said he had not been blameless in losing the house. He had not paid rent on the house regularly for the decades the family lived there and had opportunities to buy it before the sale in January they said.

Sellers market

Those who “flip” homes used to be a little-known subculture within residential real estate — they bought houses cheap fixed them up then sold them for a nice profit. I remember well how I and much of the public awakened to the existence of flippers in the last run-up. The TV show “Flip This House” started in 2005 and others have followed even as the market crashed and rose again.

In times like these flippers are a force.

Real estate experts say Tucson is experiencing an extreme sellers market with tons of demand and little supply. Among the reasons is high demand from investors some of them institutions; shortages and increasing costs of materials to build new homes; and the conversion of single-family homes to long-term and short-term rentals.

The fast-rising prices make it a flipper’s market. One of Tucson’s most prolific flippers Kyle Mokhtarian of KMS Enterprises explained what’s going on.

“It’s a stronger market than it’s ever been since we’ve been in the business” Mokhtarian said. “It’s mostly a function of the limited supply of homes.”

Often investors known as wholesalers contact homeowners — you may have received the calls or seen the mailers offering to buy your home. They are especially on the lookout for homeowners in a financial crunch.

“It’s become a big business just trying to find distressed sellers” Mokhtarian said.

The wholesalers then sell the properties to flippers like KMS Enterprises who do their thing.

Between Tucson’s low home supply the relatively low prices and the number of outdated older homes Mokhtarian said “The reality is Tucson is a very good place to do house flipping.”

Pima County Assessor’s Office data shows the number of homes likely flipped in 2020 alone. Between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31 of last year 891 homes in Pima County were sold twice suggesting they were flipped.

That of course doesn’t include houses that may have been flipped in 2020 after the flipper made the original purchase in 2019 or other transactions that bridged 2020 and 2021.

“just couldn’t face it”

By purchasing the house on North Ruston Avenue the operator of First Federal Angus Maughan had entered a delicate family situation.

Maughan did not return calls or texts sent over three days last week to ask him about his involvement with the house and the Wilsons. Neither did a business associate Jeanne Lawlor who also took part in the interactions.

In short Greg and Lisa Wilson didn’t want to move out of the house they’d lived in for decades and after the Jan. 13 sale Greg sought a loan to buy the house from First Federal. First Federal and Greg Wilson agreed on a $210000 price which would have meant a quick $70000 profit.

At the time neither son Michael Wilson nor Greg’s wife Lisa understood what was going on. Greg Wilson kept them in the dark as he tried to get approved for financing and make the deal work so the couple could stay put.

“I think he kind of strung them along saying he was getting the loan” Michael Wilson said.

In reality Greg Wilson had just one real flaw Lisa Wilson said: He was bad with money. As a result his credit wasn’t good enough to secure the loan to buy the house.

When Greg Wilson couldn’t get the loan the new owners of his family home sought an eviction. A judge made the eviction valid March 21.

The next morning Lawlor told the Pima County Constable’s Office that Greg was threatening suicide constable Kristen Randall said. Rather than proceed with the eviction the constable’s office called the Crisis Response Center.

It was too late — that morning Lisa Wilson found Greg dead at home by suicide.

“He just couldn’t face it that we were losing this house” Lisa Wilson said. “It’s just so sad. My whole life is here. Our boys grew up here.”

money to be made

Home prices have risen so fast here that a UK-based firm ranked Tucson as the top place in the world for declining affordability from 2016 to 2020. Online Mortgage Advisors compared how much space a person living on the average local annual income could afford in each of those years to make its rankings.

The University of Arizona’s Economic and Business Research Center still ranks Tucson as having the most affordable housing in the region but that may say more about the persistently expensive region than it does about Tucson.

Working for years at Primavera Foundation Michele Ream got to know many homeless people whom the Tucson market left behind. Now dedicated to real estate she likes to represent quirky homebuyers — artists musicians — and deal in Tucson’s older neighborhoods.

It’s become an impossible time for anyone on the edges of the market she said.

“You can’t even put in an offer at asking price because you’ll be outbid. It’s just a free-for-all” she told me. “Forget having a VA or FHA loan.”

“I was doing 20% over list price” she said. “You have to be flush with extra money and willing to pay over at this point.”

Anything paid beyond the market value must come in cash of course because no bank will finance for more than the property’s value.

Not long ago Ream said sellers would often be willing to help out buyers in tricky situations even maybe selling to a lower bidder if it was someone who needed help. Not anymore. There’s too much money to be made.

“The divide between people who can own homes and people who can’t is getting bigger and bigger and bigger” she said.

Funeral eviction

In the aftermath of Greg Wilson’s death the surviving Wilson family members tried to resolve the problem that Greg had been unable to. They tried to buy the house from First Federal which owns 16 homes in Pima County now according to assessor’s records.

It’s a part of doing business for flippers to deal with residents who have nowhere to go said Randall whose main job as constable is to carry out evictions. Some firms like KMS Enterprises make an effort she said. That company tries to find an affordable rental for the residents they’re displacing within their own home inventory.

“Sometimes you just have to go slow” Randall said. “If that’s your business that’s part of the calculus — a family that might have these issues.”

Michael Wilson a 30-year-old Tucson attorney told First Federal he would get approved for a loan to complete a $210000 sale.

“Initially for a day or two they agreed to it” he said. “I worked with a family friend who’s a mortgage broker. Within a few days they said they didn’t want to wait that long for me to go through the loan process.”

Then Michael Wilson’s uncle Lewis Moore stepped in. Moore who is Lisa Wilson’s brother is an attorney in Phoenix. He made a full cash offer at $210000 on March 31.

The owners never answered family members said.

“They didn’t want to sell to me or anyone in my family” Lisa Wilson said. “They said we were harassing them by trying to buy the house for me.”

“We buried him on Tuesday and by Friday they had a constable after me.”

After rejecting the sale the Wilsons said First Federal agreed to let Lisa Wilson stay for the month of April while paying rent. But the new owners called it off Michael Wilson said.

The Catholic University of America in D.C. is taking this year’s graduation ceremony off-campus by holding it at FedEx Field in Prince George’s County Maryland.

A little over 9 miles separates the usual site for graduates on the university’s Mall and where the Washington Football Team plays in Landover but Catholic University President John Garvey said with COVID-19 safety being the imperative there was no other way.

“Commencement on our beautiful campus is the event we most look forward to every year but COVID continues to make that impossible” Garvey said in a news release.

“Location is secondary for us this year. After so much time apart our priority was to bring our community together but to do so safely. I look forward to seeing everyone in person.”

Graduates and up to four guests can attend along with the school’s faculty and staff. The event will be ticketed as well but it will be a few more weeks before the university said it would be ready to release information on that process.

Catholic University said it plans to hold graduation rain or shine and guests and graduates should plan accordingly if rainy weather is expected.

Masks will be required for everyone over the age of 2 at all times. Small bags such as purses will be allowed into the stadium for the event as well.

“I would like to acknowledge the creativity of our team that has worked so hard over the past year to explore alternatives to virtual ceremonies” Garvey said.

“We know that everyone is suffering from Zoom fatigue. It’s a testament to the community culture of the University that we are able to find a way to come back together for graduation.”

The graduation is set for May 15 at 10 a.m. and will also be livestreamed for those who are unable to attend.

The university said it is looking into ways to hold a ceremony for the Class of 2020 but coronavirus-related restrictions currently prevent the alumni association’s plan of doing so on campus.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3Mvcm9ib3QtZG9nLW1ha2VzLXNob3J0LXdvcmstb2YtZmVkZXgtYm94ZXMtbWF6ZS1ndWlkZXMtYmxpbmRmb2xkZWQtbWFuLTE1OTA5Mi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robot Dog Makes Short Work of FedEx Boxes Maze Guides Blindfolded Man,"Back in the early months of 2019 one of the creepy robots currently being developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology achieved something no other four-legged creation of its kind ever achieved: the damn thing performed a backflip.

Impressive as that may have been this trick of the Cheetah robot doesn’t really translate into a skill us humans can use to advance our goals. But now comes news of some way we could actually benefit from it.Back in March scientists from the University of California Berkeley presented the Cheetah in the role of a guide dog for blind or otherwise visually impaired people. It’s a solution that has several advantages over present-day living creatures or wheeled rigid cane solutions but certainly lacks the warmth a real dog can offer.The robot was equipped with a laser system for it to be able to scan its surroundings and create a map and a camera to see. A special guiding software (which has been designed to be updatable) is also on deck governing its moves and choices.A big advantage the Cheetah has is its ability to navigate narrow spaces. It is linked to the human it is meant to help by means of a leash that allows its movements to be followed precisely and has no problem guiding humans through a maze made of FedEx boxes.The robot was so far tested using blindfolded people and as you can see in the video below it seems to be doing a great job despite the rather clunking and annoying sounds it makes.Although still far from completion the use of robot dogs in this way does come with some advantages including the fact they don’t need expensive and prolonged training to learn what they’re supposed to do.The biggest problem is how many people in need of assistance when walking would turn to this inanimate object when our trusted sidekick dogs can do the exact same thing and be cute in the process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1kYWlseS1yZWNvcmQuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNC8xMC9kaXN0cmlidXRpb24td2FyZWhvdXNlcy1zbGF0ZWQtaW5kdXN0cmlhbC1wYXJrLzcwOTMyMzIwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Distribution warehouses slated for industrial park,"Two warehouse and distribution centers are slated for the Wooster Innovation Industrial Park along North Geyers Chapel Road and Daisy Way.

Wooster Brush's international bid

Wooster City Council approved an I-2 zoning change Monday for the site that abuts Melrose Drive along with a 75% 10-year Community Reinvestment Application (CRA) for the Wooster Brush Co.

The abatement would cover $13-$19 million in new building costs and $5.25 million in new equipment and fixtures at the site. Construction is estimated at between $18.25 and $24.25 million.

What the abatement means for the city: Wooster board approves Wooster Brush abatement

The brush company plans to hire 25 new employees and move 50 from its two other crowded facilities.

Jonathan Millea the city's economic development coordinator told City Council members this would help launch the company into the global market.

""This is an incredibly significant project and will lead the way for Wooster's largest employment center"" Millea said.

If all goes to plan it would be the city's third-largest building by footprint Millea said.

Second warehouse in the works

A nearly 200000-square-foot warehouse and distribution center that will include a parking lot for trailers and trucks will occupy the second parcel of land directly east of Wooster Brush said Jacob Holdeman development associate at Indiana-based development firm Scannell Properties.

""It was originally proposed at a different location but after review and recommendation from the city they moved the facility to here"" said Andrew Dutton the city's planning and zoning manager.

After the new proposal was drawn up the city's planning commission reviewed and approved Holdeman's request for a larger outdoor parking area than what city code allowed at its April 1 meeting.

""We believe that this is a great site and I think it fits into the character of the neighborhood"" Holdeman said. ""There will be future industrial uses neighboring and existing in that Daisy Way area.""

It is not clear who will own the warehouse once construction is completed according to Dutton.

The site will make use of the planned extension that will connect Daisy Way to Old Airport Road.

No date has been determined to break ground for either facility as of yet.

It’s no secret that major corporations rely on tax loopholes to reduce their tax bill and maximize total income. A new report by the Institute of Tax and Economic Policy says that in 2020 55 major companies paid $0 in federal income tax despite collectively earning over $40 billion.

See: Should the Minimum Wage Be $15? Take Our PollFind: Fortune 500 Companies That Haven’t Paid Federal Taxes Recently

Consumer Services Energy and Communications Lead Zero Income-Tax List

The 55 companies identified by the non-profit think tank are among some of the best known brands in the world. In the consumer services section alone companies like Charter Communications (the parent of Spectrum Internet) Dish Network FedEx HP and Nike all either paid $0 in taxes or received a refund.

Energy companies were also among the major sectors that did not pay into the community chest. American Electric Power Consolidated Edison Duke Energy FirstEnergy and Xcel Energy all had either a $0 bill or a negative effective tax rate. Other big brands on the list were motor vehicle conglomerate Penske Automotive Group software giant Salesforce.com and microchip manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices.

How are the companies able to get away without paying taxes? According to the report the decades-long trend was accelerated by the passage of the CARES Act in 2020. Although the bill provided economic stimulus payments to Americans it also allowed companies to “carry back” losses from up to five years to offset income usually taxed at 35%. This allowance created $500 million in tax breaks allowing at least four companies to get to a zero-balance on their tax bill.

Other companies used creative accounting to wipe away some of their tax liability. Over 10 used executive stock option breaks to reduce their tax bills by writing off stock-option-related expenses. At least six companies used federal research and experimentation credits to significantly cut down their tax bill.

Report Comes As Top 1% Called Out for Skipping Out on 36% of Unpaid Taxes

The ITEP report comes on the heels of another investigation suggesting that America’s highest earners are responsible for over one-third of unpaid taxes. A National Bureau of Economic Research working paper suggests the wealthiest 1% may be using technology and other creative means to obfuscate their true income.

When Tesla initially dropped the price of solar roof V3 they went too low to get bites. The average wait time for a solar roof installation in the SF Bay Area is 6 months so you can guess they have more orders than they can handle. With the price increase they may include common pre-construction costs which a lot of people were complaining things like permitting new roof vents and possibly roof decking or partial repair of decking. I think most of these were included in the early days then Tesla started charging people for them because Tesla may not even break even with everything inclusive and people cried foul. So if you can get panels instead that would be a better option solar roof is a premium product but I think was priced so low that Tesla was not making much money on it. May be in another year or two when they are caught up with installation they will lower the price again.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZGVhdm9ybmV3cy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbGFyZ2Utc2NhbGUtc29sYXItY29taW5nLXRvLXBvdHRlci1jb3VudHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Large-scale solar coming to Potter County,"One massive solar energy project is coming to Potter County and a second is on the drawing board.

Groundbreaking is expected this fall for a 35-megawatt solar generation field involving more than 230 acres on the Kent Kenyon farm in Hebron Township. When work is complete much of the hilltop will be covered with solar energy panels – resembling rectangular mirrors – which number 60000 or more.

Solar arrays will be mounted at or near the intersection of West Hebron Road Ridge Road and Sheldon Hollow Road. Walden Renewable Development struck a deal with the Kenyons on a 35-year lease through its subsidiary Potter Solar LLC. Power will be fed to an adjacent West Penn Power electrical substation on Sheldon Hollow Road.

The project will require some deforestation and mitigation of about one-half acre of wetlands.

This represents the first grid-scale solar development in Potter County but probably not the last. A second major project is on the drawing board involving a long and narrow swath of land along electrical transmission lines in Potter County. Details have not yet been released.

A Potter Solar LLC spokesman said costs to produce solar energy have been greatly reduced by advanced technology and changes in the marketplace. The company is betting big on the Hebron Township project which had an estimated price tag of $50 million when it was first introduced in November 2019.

The Hebron Township project has cleared a series of regulatory hurdles covering stormwater management water discharges and road bonding as well as township and county ordinances. Among local agencies involved in the regulatory process are the Hebron Township Board of Supervisors Potter County Conservation District and Potter County Planning Commission.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMixwFodHRwczovL2t1bi51ei9lbi9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDQvMTAvdXpiZWtpc3Rhbi10by1jb21taXNzaW9uLWl0cy1maXJzdC1zb2xhci1wb3dlci1wbGFudC1pbi1zZXB0ZW1iZXI_cT0lMkZlbiUyRm5ld3MlMkYyMDIxJTJGMDQlMkYxMCUyRnV6YmVraXN0YW4tdG8tY29tbWlzc2lvbi1pdHMtZmlyc3Qtc29sYXItcG93ZXItcGxhbnQtaW4tc2VwdGVtYmVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uzbekistan to commission its first solar power plant in September,"Uzbekistan to commission its first solar power plant in September

The facility in the Karmana district is the first large solar photovoltaic plant in the history of Uzbekistan that generates electricity from renewable energy sources.

Currently technological equipment shields inverters transformers are installed at the facility with a total area of 268 hectares.

The photovoltaic station is expected to generate 260 million kWh of electricity per year and save 79 million cubic meters of natural gas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYXNlYW5wb3N0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3ZpZXRuYW0tc21hc2hlcy0yMDIwLXNvbGFyLWNhcGFjaXR5LXJlY29yZHPSAVBodHRwczovL3RoZWFzZWFucG9zdC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS92aWV0bmFtLXNtYXNoZXMtMjAyMC1zb2xhci1jYXBhY2l0eS1yZWNvcmRzP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vietnam Smashes 2020 Solar Capacity Records,"Once again Vietnam has set another local record in its solar sector. This time it is for rooftop solar installation. At the end of 2020 the country’s rooftop solar installations added 9.3 gigawatts (GW) to its national grid.

Vietnam outdid itself with a new record by creating an eight-fold increase in rooftop solar by the end of December 2020 from only 378 megawatts (MW) in 2019. What is more jaw-dropping is that 6 GW out of the 9.3 GW was built in the last month of 2020; when the solar rooftop feed-in-tariff from the government was about to expire.

Vietnam raised the bar even higher after its first unexpected solar boom in 2019 when the country racked 4.5 GW worth of installations in less than two years after the feed-in-tariff was launched. The recent achievement has effectively made Vietnam the world’s third-largest solar market in 2020.

Even though 2020 was a quite bleak year as signs of progress in the ASEAN energy sector were pushed back due to the COVID-19 pandemic Vietnam showed that the impact could be minimal for renewable energy (RE) especially solar if mitigation measures for the pandemic and policy intervention for RE were done right.

Vietnam’s take on policy support for rooftop solar is quite distinct from the rest of its ASEAN neighbours. While other ASEAN Member States (AMS) are pushing for rooftop solar using a net-metering scheme aimed at self-consumption like in Malaysia and Thailand or mainly focused on residential usage like in Indonesia Vietnam has policy support in place for solar rooftop using Feed in Tariff (FiT) just like it has done for ground-mounted solar.

The price for the first round of rooftop solar is also the same for utility-scale solar plants which is far above the price offered under typical net-metering. This scheme is quite favourable for the investor if they want to install rooftop solar either for self-consumption or selling to the grid.

With the inclusion of not only residential but industrial and commercial in terms of participation Vietnam has attracted a huge deal of investment leading to around 101000 rooftop solar installations to date. In short Vietnam is trying to amplify its utility-scale solar but instead of on land they want it on the roof.

Bigger Role

This successful initiative for RE has influenced the country’s planning for its electricity generation. The new Power Development Plan (PDP) 8 draft shows that Vietnam intends to allow RE a bigger role to play in the sector up to 2030 and even further to 2045. With high RE uptake in their grid Vietnam will require a significant transmission capacity increase and an upgrade to more flexible grid operation which means coal capacity needs to be reduced.

PDP 8 foresees significant cancellations of new coal-power plants. The country will see no additional coal-fired plants during 2026-2030 with 9.5 GW coal projects scrapped as outlined in the previous PDP as well as a 7.6 GW coal project pushed back until after 2030. Solar and wind are predicted to make up 28 percent of total system capacity in 2030 and 41 percent in 2045.

The implications of the current solar boom to the country’s electricity sector are quite clear. Vietnam’s future power sector decisions and directives (such as the need for infrastructure investment and capacity upgrade and increasing flexibility of the power system) will be shaped around the current RE success. But what does this bring to the ASEAN regional bloc?

If Vietnam keeps growing RE at its current pace the country might help ASEAN to achieve its 23 percent target of RE in its overall energy mix by 2025.

With Vietnam being the new ASEAN tiger in terms of RE in the region outstripping Thailand as the previous pioneer it could likely bring the region closer to its RE target for 2025. In 2017 the ASEAN RE share in primary energy supply was still around 13.7 percent.

According to the 6th ASEAN Energy Outlook in order to fill the gaps and achieve its target ASEAN will need to pursue a cumulative 138 GW RE capacity addition in the next five years with solar (56 percent) and hydropower (22 percent) leading the composition of this addition. To have that much RE capacity expansion ASEAN will require US$149 billion in additional cumulative investment until 2025.

If Vietnam maintains its current pace of growing solar it could do a great service by closing the gap in the region’s current RE targets. Most importantly Vietnam’s experience with solar bloom – twice – has shown that seemingly impossible things can be possible serving as inspiration for other AMS to follow a similar path especially Indonesia which has a big slice of the region’s energy supply share.

All hands indeed need to be on the deck for ASEAN to reach its RE targets but with Vietnam in the lead the bloc is well on its way to achieving its RE targets.

Vietnam can also provide a great push for the ASEAN Power Grid creating a new interconnection pathway with Vietnam as another main power trader.

Currently the showpiece of multilateral power trading in ASEAN is the Lao-Thailand-Malaysia (LTM) power interconnection project which is expanding to include Singapore (LTMS). Lao PDR as the ‘battery of ASEAN’ has a significant role in bilateral or multilateral power trading due to its great hydropower resources.

However current climate change risks such as prolonged drought have heightened the challenge in sustaining supply for these power export-import interconnections in the Mekong region during the dry season.

Source: Various

With surging solar and wind installation located mainly in the southern part of Vietnam a possibility for making new interconnections with its ASEAN neighbour is becoming more feasible. The current solar boom has made Vietnam another RE trading option for ASEAN other than Lao PDR. It is possible that soon the RE boom in Vietnam could ignite new multilateral trading under the ASEAN Power Grid.

With current and projected RE development it could also be a possibility for Vietnam to sell excess RE generated electricity to Cambodia which perhaps can turn into a Vietnam-Cambodia-Thailand-Malaysia (VCTM) interconnection in the not-so distant future.

Global Investment

Vietnam has put ASEAN on the global investment map the rest is now up to the region.

Having twice experienced a solar boom – from a solar FiT program in 2019 to rooftop solar in 2020 –Vietnam has captured the global spotlight for RE investment. Becoming the third-largest market for solar in 2020 Vietnam has gained traction from global investors. This opportunity could bring the region a fortune as Vietnam opens the door for ASEAN countries to also receive a flock of investments for RE from foreign investors if only the regulatory framework is set right.

With the region being the sixth-largest economy in the world ASEAN is expecting a rapid growth of electricity demand from sustainable sources. This means that billions of dollars in RE investments are needed.

If other AMS are quick enough to realise this opportunity and create a competitive market and conducive investment climate to allow such investments to come into their respective countries for RE it is possible that the success of Vietnam can be replicated in other AMS.

The solar boom in Vietnam has created a golden opportunity for ASEAN to accelerate its energy transition. Vietnam has provided a boost to the region’s lagging confidence that the 23 percent RE target of 2025 is indeed achievable provided all AMS can show similar vigour and spirit in developing RE as Vietnam has.

On Thursday Links chapter members as well as the community is gathering on Zoom to raise money and virtually commemorate the organization.

Though Links is a national service organization for Black women Links - Cincinnati (OH) focuses on youth in the Greater Cincinnati area. Internationally Links has more than 16000 members.

The Leadership Academy for Girls

The Leadership Academy for Girls the brain child of Links president Shelley Hamler is a safe space for young Black women to ""come into their own.""

The Academy focuses on topics like mental health self esteem anti-bullying and college and career readiness.

""The reason we chose African American girls is that we felt they needed additional role models. And they needed to be able to see successful women. Not that they couldn't see that in their homes but the more the merrier"" Hamler said.

Twenty girls from schools across the Cincinnati Public Schools district are participating in the program. Most have been nominated by principals and administrators at the schools and have been a part of the program since seventh and eighth grade. The inaugural class will be graduating high school next year.

The pandemic hasn't stalled this organization. Links mentors drop off monthly boxes to the high school girls that include things like sanitary pads mini Ninja blenders for smoothies shirts that say ""Black Girl Magic"" as well as kits for that month's lesson.

Hamler said she hopes to provide scholarships for the young women as they head to college.

Zoom meetings have included visits from Disney star Navia Robinson artist Annie Ruth and international students from Peru and Africa.

Links keeps the parents involved too.

""I've never had anybody try to reach out to me"" said Danita Johnson Macy Johnson's mother. ""Links always goes above and beyond introducing these girls to all sorts of things and through different walks of life.""

Macy attends the School for Creative and Performing Arts. Through Links Macy has been in ACT training free of charge and recently met with a Links member who has a daughter on Broadway. Macy hopes to someday be on Broadway too.

""It helps me seeing Black women doing things that I might be able to do"" Macy said. ""The Links sisters make me feel more comfortable in public spaces. I feel like Links has gotten me out of my shell a lot.""

Macy is hoping to attend a historically Black college or university.

""We want to give them experiences they've probably never had before"" Hamler said.

The organization has created a network for these high school students who have found friends their own age as well as mentors and opportunities.

""We've all become pretty close"" said Tamia Palmer an 11th grader at Walnut Hills High School who joined the Leadership Academy in 10th grade. ""It's really good to see representation. Like seeing our Links sister Jan-Michele (Lemon Kearney) and she's a councilwoman or our other Links sister Shelley Hamler is a doctor. Or around the time of the election we had this safe space to talk about it all and we got to see a Links sister Kamala Harris head into office.""

The Leadership Academy for Girls is one of the biggest programs for Cincinnati's Links chapter but it has other programs such as the Youth Docent program.

The program is open to Tri-State area teenagers of all races and is an opportunity to learn about the Underground Railroad as well as talk about about present-day slavery and freedom. Through classes and service projects across the city Links helps students understand the legacy of slavery in the country.

""Some parents may not be able to afford to expose kids to stuff so this helps open the door for a lot of kids"" said Tamiko Palmer Tamia's mom. ""It's a safe space for them.""

71 years of Links in Cincinnati

The pandemic postponed last year's celebration for the 70th anniversary of Cincinnati's Links chapter.

The director nomination was submitted Friday by the motorcycle manufacturer's CEO Jochen Zeitz as part of the 2021 Notice of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders and Proxy Statement released in advance of the May 20 vote.

Farley is the only new board nominee. If approved he would join executives with diverse corporate backgrounds that include Levi Strauss Ocean5 Starbucks the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ABB Robotics and the Cummins engine and technology company.

“Jochen's vision to bring adventure to a wider audience in different forms resonates with me. I’m honored to be nominated for a seat on the Harley-Davidson board"" Farley told the Free Press on Saturday.

""It’s also good for Ford another chance for us to learn from one of the best"" he said. ""This is a legendary American brand with a proud global history and enduring values. Like Ford they now want to transform how people move including new customers —through always-on relationships new technologies and must-have products and services.”

Zeitz and Farley both 58 run iconic American manufacturing brands in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. They've had to cut jobs restructure and redefine their legacies.

Zeitz is a turnaround expert who transformed Puma from near bankruptcy to a top athletic brand globally. He took the top job at Harley-Davidson in May. Farley assumed the top job at Ford in October.

Not only does Farley collect classic cars but he also owns and rides Harley-Davidson bikes: a 1939 EL Knucklehead and a 1942 WLA Navy bike. He restored both bikes with a lot of help from his friends. Farley is known for working on classics himself.

""Jim Farley is cut from the cloth of Harley-Davidson. He is a working person's CEO who likes to race cars"" said Marick Masters a business professor at the Mike Ilitch School of Business at Wayne State University in Detroit. ""His adventurous spirit captures the essence of Harley-Davidson. ... Farley brings a drive and energy to complement the Harley-Davidson brand.""

These days Harley-Davidson is looking to find new consumers and shore up its financials. The brand thrived during World War II making motorcycles for the U.S. military. Later the bikes evolved into a symbol of counterculture.

""The world's youth were out on the road seeking freedom and the motorcycle was as sure a vehicle as any to offer a quick hit of it"" said the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum website for its 1998 exhibition ""The Art of the Motorcycle."" ""Rebellion became fashion and Hollywood Madison Avenue and the motorcycle industry capitalized as never before.""

The ad campaign for Peter Fonda's 1969 film ""Easy Rider"" proclaimed ""A man went looking for America and couldn't find it anywhere"" a sentiment that could be expanded to embrace the entire decade the Guggenheim said.

By 2018 a Harley-Davidson motorcycle averaged $20000 and the average buyer age hovered around 50 Business Insider reported.

""Seeing the trials of another classic American brand can help Farley better prepare for potential issues within Ford"" said Sam Fiorani vice president of AutoForecast Solutions based in Chester Springs Pennsylvania.

""With Harley-Davidson at a very competitive juncture in its industry having someone with corporate turnaround experience like Farley on the board can only benefit the legendary company"" Fiorani said.

""While automobiles and motorcycles are very different industries navigating an established brand like Harley-Davidson would be akin to maintaining iconic brands like F-150 or Mustang through changing markets"" he said. ""Ford has done an admirable job of securing their history to the present day.""

Harley-Davidson was reborn 40 years ago by concentrating on what made their bikes different Fiorani said. ""Finding a similar direction going forward is necessary for the brand’s long-term survival and Farley has the history to help guide the company toward that future.""

The iconic nature of Ford and Harley-Davidson isn't simply incidental said Harley Shaiken a labor economist who specializes in global production at the University of California Berkeley. ""Building on their past could be key to their future.""

The two companies have become a part of the American story ""from the Joads driving West in a Model T in 'The Grapes of Wrath' to Marlon Brando"" who purchased a 1970 Harley-Davidson FLH Electra-Glide after filming ""The Wild One"" Shaiken said. ""So it’s somehow fitting that the CEO of one is now sitting on the board of the other at a tough moment.""

Brando played a motorcycle gang leader in the 1953 film and rode a 1950 6T Triumph Thunderbird.

GM CEO on another board

Directors on the Harley-Davidson board earned an annual fee of $91630 in fiscal year 2020 according to its proxy report. They have the option of receiving all or a portion of their fees in the form of stock.

Farley serves on no other corporate boards of directors except Ford. Farley does represent Ford on the U.S.-China Business Council board of directors and has been appointed co-chair of the Commission on the Future of Mobility.

It is not unusual for CEOs to serve on select boards and develop important business relationships outside their companies. General Motors CEO Mary Barra has served on the board of Walt Disney Co. since 2017.

Lincoln. Bronco.

Even before the new Bronco goes on sale some dealers are planning to turn the SUV and its offshoots into essentially a third brand for Ford Motor Co. by adding dedicated showrooms.

It's an idea originated by dealers not a top-down edict from the factory. At their request Ford created renderings for standalone stores and agreed to reward those who open one by slightly increasing their Bronco allocations.

Ford officials expect about 100 dealers to build Bronco showrooms which will be near or connected to existing Ford stores and feature the SUV's horse logo instead of the Blue Oval.

A separate store is one of several optional facility improvements Ford has developed for dealers to show off one of its most highly anticipated nameplates in years as well as the Bronco Sport that arrived in January and future additions to the off-roader family. It comes as rival Jeep prepares to add hundreds of standalone showrooms and a little more than a decade after Ford trimmed its portfolio and retail network to focus exclusively on the Ford and Lincoln brands.

""It's an announcement to the world we're back; the Bronco is back"" Tim Hovik owner of San Tan Ford in Gilbert Ariz. and chairman of Ford's national dealer council told Automotive News. ""It's such an iconic product that in an absolute way we feel a Ford dealer is really adding almost an additional franchise.""

Ford's design calls for a sleek 3800-square-foot building with an outdoor fire pit indoor accessory wall and room to display three vehicles. The exterior includes black paneled siding a gray stone entryway and wood accents.

Andrew Frick Ford's head of U.S. sales said the automaker came up with three ways dealers can highlight the Bronco: a standalone showroom an expansion of existing showrooms or displays that can be added to a showroom.

""So we have an option for pretty much any budget and as we've repeated several times it's all strictly optional"" he said in an emailed statement to Automotive News.

Ford wanted the Bronco's launch to be focused on the product rather than facility upgrades but some dealers made clear that they were interested in making significant upgrades to promote the vehicle Frick said.

""The excitement around this iconic brand and dealer confidence in our Ford brand generated the initial request and ideation for the Bronco store"" he said.

""We did develop an official Bronco showroom bringing to life the essence of Bronco to ensure consistency across the network for those that wanted to more heavily invest.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA0LTExL2hhcmxleS1kYXZpZHNvbi1ub21pbmF0ZXMtZm9yZC1jZW8tZmFybGV5LXRvLWpvaW4taXRzLWJvYXJk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harley-Davidson Nominates Ford CEO Farley to Join Its Board,"Harley-Davidson Inc. nominated Ford Motor Co.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % MCD MCDONALD'S CORP. 269.30 -1.02 -0.38% WMT WALMART INC. 59.87 +0.05 +0.08%

This summer hundreds of McDonald’s eateries located inside Walmart stores across the US are slated to close because of sluggish business — a trend that was accelerated by the pandemic.

The decades-old partnership between the largest restaurant chain and largest retailer in the world has been fraying for years. There were about 1000 McDonald’s restaurants inside Walmart stores during their heyday but by 2020 there were half as many McDonald’s stores Walmart confirmed.

MCDONALD'S TO HIRE 25000 STAFF IN TEXAS THIS MONTH

In July McDonald’s said in its second quarter earnings report that it would be closing 200 restaurants in 2020 and that over half of them were at ""lower sales volume"" Walmart locations.

At the end of the summer just 150 McDonald’s stores will remain at Walmart the retailer confirmed.

The accelerated pace of store closures was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

McDonald’s does a significant amount of business via its drive-thrus — more so since the pandemic began — and Walmart lacks that option sources pointed out. Margins at McDonald’s Walmart locations have likewise been hit as ""customers at times loaded up on refills and condiments"" according to the Journal. Walmart also has largely stopped building new stores instead remodeling them which has created awkward situations according to the paper.

""You can’t do a multimillion-dollar remodel in a store and then have a 1980s McDonald’s at the front"" one source told the Journal.

Subway eateries are also pulling up stakes in Walmart stores according to the paper. The franchise is facing its own challenges as The Post has reported with stores closing across the country.

Walmart which has long relied on rent from restaurants and other in-store tenants to pad its bottom line said its stores will be switching to more grab-and go options. In addition to food Walmart leases space to banks hair and nail salons and veterinarian clinicc. In Texas it has a number of tool-rental stores inside its stores the company said.

""We have a great opportunity with our leased space business to help our stores become even more convenient and relevant to local communities"" the company said in a statement. ""We are excited to continue to bring in new businesses that make sense for our customers and their changing needs.""

Walmart is testing smoothie vending machines in stores and opening Charleys Philly Steaks locations which is a 600-store chain and Walmart is also working with a Sushi concept in its home state of Arkansas and a concept called Ghost Kitchens which allows customers to order food from other restaurants.

It’s also in discussions with Domino’s to add more locations to its existing 30 eateries inside Walmart locations the company said. The pizza chain however had to convince Walmart that it wouldn’t hurt Walmart’s frozen pizza business according to The Journal.

Twentieth Century Studios in association with Marvel Entertainment presents The New Mutants an original horror thriller directed by Josh Boone and written by Boone and Knate Lee. The film stars Emmy nominee Maisie Williams Anya Taylor-Joy Charlie Heaton Alice Braga Henry Zaga and Blu Hunt.

Rahne Sinclair (Williams) Illyana Rasputin (Taylor-Joy) Sam Guthrie (Heaton) and Roberto da Costa (Zaga) are four young mutants being held in an isolated hospital for psychiatric monitoring. Dr. Cecilia Reyes (Braga) believing the teenagers are a danger both to themselves and to society as a whole keeps a close eye on them as she struggles to teach them how to rein in their mutant abilities. When newcomer Danielle “Dani” Moonstar (Hunt) joins the other patients in the facility strange occurrences begin to take place. The hospital’s patients are plagued by hallucinations and flashbacks and their new mutant abilities—and their friendships—will be tested they battle to try to make it out alive.

“It’s so wonderful I think. There was a lot of uncertainty with this film and when it was going to get released. And to know there was an audience still willing to wait as long as it took and even through this pandemic have been so supportive it’s just been really exciting. I can’t wait for people to finally see it” Maisie proclaimed.

“They’re my favorite fans because they actually don’t complain. They just do really cool artwork of the characters. There’s probably 100 plus pieces of artwork fans have done I’d still like to figure out a way to get permission from everybody and do a book” said Boone.

Boone and Lee were both fans of the X-Men comics and were especially drawn to the New Mutants storyline which debuted in Marvel Graphic Novel #4 in 1982. Written by Chris Claremont with illustrations by Bob McLeod the series introduced a whole new cast of characters who had little affiliation with the students from Professor Charles Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters.

The characters’ powers and backgrounds were more unconventional and very psychological compared to the rest of the mainline X-Men characters. “It was the first X-Men spinoff comic ever and it was done at a time when the X-Men were thought to be dead so Xavier had to bring new students together” explains Boone.

“I wrote this with my very best friend in the world. We’ve known each other since we were little babies. Our moms are best friends. And we grew up in the 1980’s reading Marvel Comics and I still vividly remember to this day seeing the covers of the New Mutants comics because they did not look like any comic book covers I’d ever seen before. They were painted they were impressionistic they were had a more slippery surreal look than typical comic books do. So they really captured my imagination and I thought about them really for years. I remember being in L.A. when I first moved out 10 years before I even made a movie. I had a stack of New Mutants comics and I was like one day” said Boone.

“I was lucky enough to have made a movie for Fox that was successful and begged them to let us take a crack at these comics. So it all goes back back to my childhood or goes back to things I feel real passion and love for because that’s really all that can sustain you through how long it takes to make something get it made shoot it write it edit it. We try to pick things we have deep passionate feelings for to hopefully connected to our childhood” Boone continued.

The New Mutants was filmed on location in and around Boston from July 10th to September 15 2017 almost entirely in Milbury Hospital where there is a certain amount of claustrophobia written into the story. The team was looking to effectively capture that trapped feeling with the filming location.

Luckily they found an abandoned medical facility in New England comprised numerous buildings of which they were able to gut and clean five buildings and make them safe for filming. The hospital is its own character in the film and the atmosphere of being in a place that is real adds to the overall creepiness of the location.

“Filming there really helped to get the feel of [the movie]. Having actual walls and actual energy felt like we were doing an independent film sometimes. It wasn’t only blue screens and creating. Filming at night was kind of scary. I wouldn’t walk by myself. There was no way” said Ana-Taylor Joy.

“The setting really helped because it did feel like we were kind of in a high school slash college experience. But we were all going to the same place every single day and then going back to dorms. It was like a college experience but where the set you were on somebody had hung themselves there maybe 40 years before” Anya-Taylor Joy continued.

The new mutants in Milbury Hospital become haunted by their pasts in the form of manifested visions and it is only through these flashbacks or hauntings the audience sees the characters outside of the hospital.

“Several crew members who had weird experiences there had to be walked to their car at night because they were scared to walk there by themselves after they’d be in the buildings all day. People definitely had weird encounters” said Boone.

When the story begins the five protagonists are fragile and confused kids and by the end of the film they have all become the New Mutants and it is a story told in an interesting way. The New Mutants is very much a coming-of-age story about young adults accepting what’s happened in their pasts so they can move forward into the future. We all have a history and past we have to move beyond and within this story we wanted to embrace a narrative which provides a strong emotional spine.

“It is still a horror film” adds Boone “it’s just one that is more in the vein of a horror novel so it’s more character driven but with that added horror aspect as well.”

The characters at the heart of this story are grappling with their burgeoning mutant abilities as well as real issues all teenagers face and they are all able to deal with their issues and problems together. The cast grew quite close as a result.

“During production for us kids we actually lived in a situation that mirrored what the characters were experiencing on screen” says Anya Taylor-Joy “because we were five strangers who came together and basically had to use each other as family building blocks every single day and that’s exactly what these kids went through in that hospital.”

When it came to casting the five young mutants around whom the story evolves Josh Boone wanted to ensure the characters were grounded and credible. Each of the five main characters has suffered some sort of trauma that involved someone dying or damaging someone else’s life and Josh Boone wanted to be sure the young characters were different from those personified on screen in previous X-Men films.

Fortunately it was a fairly simple process due to Boone’s past experience with young actors. “These characters are teenagers” said Boone. “They are dealing with things like being horny at the same time they’re having these terrible things happen to them so our intent was to have those things happen in that reality.”

“Horror movies are a great escape” says Boone “because you can go to the movie theaters and deal with all the anxiety you don’t want to think about when you are lying in bed at night staring up at the ceiling. It’s like a healthy way to go through all that.”

“Any opportunity to go back to teenagedom is not necessarily the most fun experience but you definitely learn a lot about yourself afterwards. It’s interesting because I think we all came into this knowing that whilst we were making a superhero movie we weren’t really making a superhero movie. We were making a film about people who were having a tough time understanding themselves and figuring out their place in the world” said Anya-Taylor Joy.

“And so to make it a bit more cinematic we added powers. But I do think any teenager that’s going through the growing pains [and] trying to understand where you fit in you’re no longer a child but like what is this weird adult world. I think they’ll definitely connect with it” Anya-Taylor Joy continued.

“The New Mutants was really made for teenagers who are outsiders people who feel out of place and who are going through a tough time in general. I sort of always say I make couch movies which are like when I was a teenager and I was really depressed I’d have like a certain movie I’d pop on and go lay on the couch. It made me feel better. So it’s like these kind of movies are those kind of movies where hopefully they’ll be your friend” Josh Boone concluded.

The New Mutants is available now on HBO Max.

When the bank attempted to reclaim the money the request was rejected because the money was not available according to the sheriff's office.

The sheriff's office said it was later learned that Spadoni had moved the funds into another account.

Capt. Jason Rivarde a sheriff's spokesman said that although the money was put into her account ""it's not her money.""

""She has no legal claim to that money"" he added. ""Even if it was put in there by mistake. It was an accounting error.""

Charles Schwab & Co. sued Spadoni on Tuesday in federal court. The company tried to contact Spadoni several times to have the transferred funds returned but were unsuccessful Rivarde said. So far about 75% of the money has been recovered he added.

The company argued in its lawsuit that Spadoni's account contract with Schwab includes an agreement that if a client receives an overpayment of funds the client is required to return the full amount.

""If someone accidentally puts an extra zero on a utility payment they would want that money returned or credited to them. This is no different"" Rivarde said.

He said Spadoni had been with the sheriff's office 911 center for 4 and 1/2 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvc2hvdy9leHBsb3JpbmctaGF0ZS1hbi1pbnNpZGUtbG9vay1hdC1hbnRpLWV4dHJlbWlzbS10cmFpbmluZy1pbi10aGUtbWlsaXRhcnnSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5wYnMub3JnL25ld3Nob3VyL2FtcC9zaG93L2V4cGxvcmluZy1oYXRlLWFuLWluc2lkZS1sb29rLWF0LWFudGktZXh0cmVtaXNtLXRyYWluaW5nLWluLXRoZS1taWxpdGFyeQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exploring Hate: An inside look at anti-extremism training in the military,"Hari Sreenivasan:

Ticker Security Last Change Change % MCD MCDONALD'S CORP. 269.30 -1.02 -0.38% WMT WALMART INC. 59.87 +0.05 +0.08%

This summer hundreds of McDonald’s eateries located inside Walmart stores across the US are slated to close because of sluggish business — a trend that was accelerated by the pandemic.

The decades-old partnership between the largest restaurant chain and largest retailer in the world has been fraying for years. There were about 1000 McDonald’s restaurants inside Walmart stores during their heyday but by 2020 there were half as many McDonald’s stores Walmart confirmed.

MCDONALD'S TO HIRE 25000 STAFF IN TEXAS THIS MONTH

In July McDonald’s said in its second quarter earnings report that it would be closing 200 restaurants in 2020 and that over half of them were at ""lower sales volume"" Walmart locations.

At the end of the summer just 150 McDonald’s stores will remain at Walmart the retailer confirmed.

The accelerated pace of store closures was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

McDonald’s does a significant amount of business via its drive-thrus — more so since the pandemic began — and Walmart lacks that option sources pointed out. Margins at McDonald’s Walmart locations have likewise been hit as ""customers at times loaded up on refills and condiments"" according to the Journal. Walmart also has largely stopped building new stores instead remodeling them which has created awkward situations according to the paper.

""You can’t do a multimillion-dollar remodel in a store and then have a 1980s McDonald’s at the front"" one source told the Journal.

Subway eateries are also pulling up stakes in Walmart stores according to the paper. The franchise is facing its own challenges as The Post has reported with stores closing across the country.

Walmart which has long relied on rent from restaurants and other in-store tenants to pad its bottom line said its stores will be switching to more grab-and go options. In addition to food Walmart leases space to banks hair and nail salons and veterinarian clinicc. In Texas it has a number of tool-rental stores inside its stores the company said.

""We have a great opportunity with our leased space business to help our stores become even more convenient and relevant to local communities"" the company said in a statement. ""We are excited to continue to bring in new businesses that make sense for our customers and their changing needs.""

Walmart is testing smoothie vending machines in stores and opening Charleys Philly Steaks locations which is a 600-store chain and Walmart is also working with a Sushi concept in its home state of Arkansas and a concept called Ghost Kitchens which allows customers to order food from other restaurants.

Twentieth Century Studios in association with Marvel Entertainment presents The New Mutants an original horror thriller directed by Josh Boone and written by Boone and Knate Lee. The film stars Emmy nominee Maisie Williams Anya Taylor-Joy Charlie Heaton Alice Braga Henry Zaga and Blu Hunt.

Rahne Sinclair (Williams) Illyana Rasputin (Taylor-Joy) Sam Guthrie (Heaton) and Roberto da Costa (Zaga) are four young mutants being held in an isolated hospital for psychiatric monitoring. Dr. Cecilia Reyes (Braga) believing the teenagers are a danger both to themselves and to society as a whole keeps a close eye on them as she struggles to teach them how to rein in their mutant abilities. When newcomer Danielle “Dani” Moonstar (Hunt) joins the other patients in the facility strange occurrences begin to take place. The hospital’s patients are plagued by hallucinations and flashbacks and their new mutant abilities—and their friendships—will be tested they battle to try to make it out alive.

“It’s so wonderful I think. There was a lot of uncertainty with this film and when it was going to get released. And to know there was an audience still willing to wait as long as it took and even through this pandemic have been so supportive it’s just been really exciting. I can’t wait for people to finally see it” Maisie proclaimed.

“They’re my favorite fans because they actually don’t complain. They just do really cool artwork of the characters. There’s probably 100 plus pieces of artwork fans have done I’d still like to figure out a way to get permission from everybody and do a book” said Boone.

Boone and Lee were both fans of the X-Men comics and were especially drawn to the New Mutants storyline which debuted in Marvel Graphic Novel #4 in 1982. Written by Chris Claremont with illustrations by Bob McLeod the series introduced a whole new cast of characters who had little affiliation with the students from Professor Charles Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters.

The characters’ powers and backgrounds were more unconventional and very psychological compared to the rest of the mainline X-Men characters. “It was the first X-Men spinoff comic ever and it was done at a time when the X-Men were thought to be dead so Xavier had to bring new students together” explains Boone.

“I wrote this with my very best friend in the world. We’ve known each other since we were little babies. Our moms are best friends. And we grew up in the 1980’s reading Marvel Comics and I still vividly remember to this day seeing the covers of the New Mutants comics because they did not look like any comic book covers I’d ever seen before. They were painted they were impressionistic they were had a more slippery surreal look than typical comic books do. So they really captured my imagination and I thought about them really for years. I remember being in L.A. when I first moved out 10 years before I even made a movie. I had a stack of New Mutants comics and I was like one day” said Boone.

“I was lucky enough to have made a movie for Fox that was successful and begged them to let us take a crack at these comics. So it all goes back back to my childhood or goes back to things I feel real passion and love for because that’s really all that can sustain you through how long it takes to make something get it made shoot it write it edit it. We try to pick things we have deep passionate feelings for to hopefully connected to our childhood” Boone continued.

The New Mutants was filmed on location in and around Boston from July 10th to September 15 2017 almost entirely in Milbury Hospital where there is a certain amount of claustrophobia written into the story. The team was looking to effectively capture that trapped feeling with the filming location.

Luckily they found an abandoned medical facility in New England comprised numerous buildings of which they were able to gut and clean five buildings and make them safe for filming. The hospital is its own character in the film and the atmosphere of being in a place that is real adds to the overall creepiness of the location.

“Filming there really helped to get the feel of [the movie]. Having actual walls and actual energy felt like we were doing an independent film sometimes. It wasn’t only blue screens and creating. Filming at night was kind of scary. I wouldn’t walk by myself. There was no way” said Ana-Taylor Joy.

“The setting really helped because it did feel like we were kind of in a high school slash college experience. But we were all going to the same place every single day and then going back to dorms. It was like a college experience but where the set you were on somebody had hung themselves there maybe 40 years before” Anya-Taylor Joy continued.

The new mutants in Milbury Hospital become haunted by their pasts in the form of manifested visions and it is only through these flashbacks or hauntings the audience sees the characters outside of the hospital.

“Several crew members who had weird experiences there had to be walked to their car at night because they were scared to walk there by themselves after they’d be in the buildings all day. People definitely had weird encounters” said Boone.

When the story begins the five protagonists are fragile and confused kids and by the end of the film they have all become the New Mutants and it is a story told in an interesting way. The New Mutants is very much a coming-of-age story about young adults accepting what’s happened in their pasts so they can move forward into the future. We all have a history and past we have to move beyond and within this story we wanted to embrace a narrative which provides a strong emotional spine.

“It is still a horror film” adds Boone “it’s just one that is more in the vein of a horror novel so it’s more character driven but with that added horror aspect as well.”

The characters at the heart of this story are grappling with their burgeoning mutant abilities as well as real issues all teenagers face and they are all able to deal with their issues and problems together. The cast grew quite close as a result.

“During production for us kids we actually lived in a situation that mirrored what the characters were experiencing on screen” says Anya Taylor-Joy “because we were five strangers who came together and basically had to use each other as family building blocks every single day and that’s exactly what these kids went through in that hospital.”

When it came to casting the five young mutants around whom the story evolves Josh Boone wanted to ensure the characters were grounded and credible. Each of the five main characters has suffered some sort of trauma that involved someone dying or damaging someone else’s life and Josh Boone wanted to be sure the young characters were different from those personified on screen in previous X-Men films.

Fortunately it was a fairly simple process due to Boone’s past experience with young actors. “These characters are teenagers” said Boone. “They are dealing with things like being horny at the same time they’re having these terrible things happen to them so our intent was to have those things happen in that reality.”

“Horror movies are a great escape” says Boone “because you can go to the movie theaters and deal with all the anxiety you don’t want to think about when you are lying in bed at night staring up at the ceiling. It’s like a healthy way to go through all that.”

“Any opportunity to go back to teenagedom is not necessarily the most fun experience but you definitely learn a lot about yourself afterwards. It’s interesting because I think we all came into this knowing that whilst we were making a superhero movie we weren’t really making a superhero movie. We were making a film about people who were having a tough time understanding themselves and figuring out their place in the world” said Anya-Taylor Joy.

“And so to make it a bit more cinematic we added powers. But I do think any teenager that’s going through the growing pains [and] trying to understand where you fit in you’re no longer a child but like what is this weird adult world. I think they’ll definitely connect with it” Anya-Taylor Joy continued.

“The New Mutants was really made for teenagers who are outsiders people who feel out of place and who are going through a tough time in general. I sort of always say I make couch movies which are like when I was a teenager and I was really depressed I’d have like a certain movie I’d pop on and go lay on the couch. It made me feel better. So it’s like these kind of movies are those kind of movies where hopefully they’ll be your friend” Josh Boone concluded.

The New Mutants is available now on HBO Max.

And it seems the couple along with their three children - sons Kalan Alexander 16 Aidan Patrick 14 and daughter Aerin Elisabeth 10 - are here to stay.

On Saturday the Sydney Morning Herald reported that the Murdochs will be in Australia 'for years not months as initially believed.'

The family who are based in their Bellevue Hill compound Le Manoir have certainly settled into life in Sydney after Sarah was seen at the Royal Easter Show in Olympic Park with her children.

The publication also confirmed that the Murdoch kids are enrolled in Sydney schools.

Sarah has also recently returned to the social scene stepping out to attend the Australian Ballet's opening night of New York Dialects.

She was met with Sydney's elite including the likes of Vogue Australia editor Edwina McCann Qantas CEO Alan Joyce and Roslyn Packer.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Fox Corporation for comment.

The Murdochs quietly slipped into Australia from the US on their private jet last month.

While no reason was given for the family's return Down Under a new report claimed that it was the political climate in the US that helped make the decision for the family to leave LA in favour of their Sydney home.

Earlier this month the Sydney Morning Herald reported that the family 'felt the cold winds of political change' when Joe Biden assumed power over Donald Trump after the family-owned Fox News appeared to favour the Republican Party throughout the election campaign.

The publication also claimed things 'got pretty rough' for their children at school.

A source said: 'The school communities here are very close knit and it extends into the wider families and the circles and parties they all go to. That Hollywood set is very pro-Democratic.

'They are mostly big fundraisers for Biden so you can imagine how well it went down when one of their classmates' dads is at the helm of the biggest anti-Biden machine in the country.'

Despite their life in Los Angeles where Lachlan is Executive Chairman and CEO of Fox Corporation the couple has always maintained their Bellevue Hill abode.

It's not known how long the glamorous family plan to stay in Australia although a large 90th birthday for patriarch Rupert is said to be planned for July this year in California."

This is evident from the top list of AMCs released by AMFI. Except for one change the list comprises the same fund houses that made up the list three years back in March 2018.

IDFC Mutual Fund is the only addition to the latest rankings as compared to the 2018 list. Franklin Templeton MF is the one that has been pushed out. The AMC now occupies the 11th spot three places down from the 2018 position.

The other AMCs in the list might have remained the same but their positions have shuffled a bit. SBI MF the top ranked AMC is the biggest gainer. It was at the fifth position three years back. Other winners include Kotak Mahindra MF (up two spots at fifth) and Axis MF (up three spots at seven).

HDFC MF held on to its second spot. ICICI Prudential MF Nippon India MF and UTI MF slipped two spots each and are now placed at third sixth and eight positions respectively.

Aditya Birla Sun Life MF (rank four) and DSP MF (rank 10) were down one spot.

On the AUM front the biggest gainer was Axis MF with 154% rise as compared to the 2018 AUM. With 132% rise SBI MF was the other big gainer.

As of now SBI MF has a comfortable lead over the second ranked HDFC MF.

It also intends to expand its reach to over 70 locations in the next six months from 35 currently buoyed by increasing awareness about protection in the country InsuranceDekho co-founder and CEO Ankit Agrawal told PTI in an interaction.

The company which mainly caters to motor health and life insurance segments had a premium of Rs 600 crore in the preceding fiscal year.

Agrawal said InsuranceDekho is one of the few companies that expanded even during the COVID-19 times and the pandemic has helped create a lot of awareness in people about importance of insurance.

""Even as the first quarter (April-June 2020) was the washout in terms of motor (insurance) perspective at the same time health and life insurance saw significant growth. People realised the importance of protection in terms of health and life and they started buying these products more proactively.

""I think that after the first quarter business started picking up. We exited March (2021) with our lifetime high revenue and premium numbers"" Agrawal said.

He added that from the adoption perspective people realised the importance of technology. ""Earlier people never understood technology why it is important for insurance etc. So we saw more payments getting online more policies being issued online the entire shift happened from offline to offline because of the pandemic.""



The company is on target of meeting Rs 1200 crore premium for 2020-21. In the preceding year the premium collection was of Rs 600 crore he said.

The direct brokers such as InsuranceDekho can earn revenues in the range of 15-22.50 per cent of the premium collection in case of motor insurance and about 15-25 per cent in the health segment according to Irdai-mandated guidelines.

Agarwal said what COVID-19 has done for the insurance awareness in the country no amount of government and industry spending could have done.

Insurance penetration in India is still low as compared to the developed countries. A lot more needs to be done to raise awareness among people despite concerted efforts by the government the regulator and the industry players he added.

During the first decade of insurance sector liberalisation in India the sector reported an increase in insurance penetration from 2.71 per cent in 2001 to 5.20 per cent in 2009 according to the latest data from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai).

Since then it declined to 3.30 per cent by 2014 and again started increasing from 2015 and in 2019 penetration was 3.76 per cent.

Insurance penetration is measured as the percentage of insurance premium to GDP of a country.

Agrawal said that as a growing company InsuranceDekho intends to increase its presence from 35 locations currently to 70 in the next six months.

""We think we would perhaps be one of the few companies which expanded even during COVID-19 times.

""We added 300 people during COVID-19 on our payrolls and will add couple of hundred more in coming days. Also in the past four-five weeks we opened five branch offices"" he said.

Agrawal said the momentum of buying insurance on a priority basis will remain there at least for the next one or two quarters.

""When a calamity like this happens people reset their spending habits and reset the way of their living. I think the same thing is going to happen post-COVID-19 also. The increased awareness about buying insurance will continue"" he added.

The aggregator however is also of the view that life insurance premium is slated to increase for certain categories.

""Besides in health also we might see some increase happening there"" Agrawal said.

On the new kind of products in the sector he said a lot of interest is being observed in areas such as cyber insurance bite-size insurance (small size or sachet) as well as home insurance. ""We will now start focusing on these segments.""



Asked about any plans to hit the capital market InsuranceDekho said initial public offering (IPO) is not on the radar at least for the next 3-4 years.

Agrawal said the company is sufficiently capitalised as of now and it may raise capital as and when it feels there is a need for money.

In September last year InsuranceDekho was committed USD 20 million (Rs 147 crore) investment from its parent GirnarSoft.",,,,,,,,,

CATL has already invested in companies mining other battery metals such as lithium and nickel in a bid to secure supply.

The investment gives CATL access to the Kisanfu copper-cobalt mine in the DRC one of the world’s largest undeveloped sources of cobalt

Moly which bought its stake in Kisanfu in December said in a separate statement it and CATL “will fund the project capex in proportion to their ownership in KFM to jointly build a world-class copper and cobalt producer.”

Moly will retain 75% of KFM and future production will also be split 75:25.

The partnership sees Moly become “a long-term cobalt supplier to the world’s largest power battery manufacturer” it added.

Kisanfu located near Moly’s giant Tenke Fungurume copper-cobalt mine in the DRC the world’s biggest cobalt-producing country contains an estimated 3.1 million tonnes of cobalt metal as well as 6.2 million tonnes of copper.

The DRC government has a 5% stake meaning Moly’s actual holding in Kisanfu will be 71.25% and CATL’s 23.75%.

And these forces will reshape how tech CEOs approach key initiatives including product strategy and launch customer acquisition business performance management and corporate development.

That’s according to Gartner’s report Top Priorities for Tech & Service Providers: Leadership Vision for 2021.

Tech CEOs who understand and adapt to these key disruptions will be well-positioned to discover and respond to new opportunities for growth. According to Gartner here are the emerging trends expected challenges and next steps that tech CEO should be taking.

The trends that will impact tech CEOs

The first trend is that cloud infrastructure and platform service providers will have significant implications for growth. The spectrum of dependence on cloud infrastructure and platform service providers will of course vary by organization but Gartner predicts that by 2025 95% of the software application providers that consume cloud platform services as part of their product offerings will also market sell and provision their offerings through cloud platform marketplaces.

The next trend to note is that free trials and freemiums will become the new normal for enterprise IT offerings. Service providers will adopt business models pricing and packaging that enable these options as essential tools for customer acquisition. These models will transform ‘proof of concept’ into ‘proof of value’ for customers and enable tech CEOs to increase their organizations’ ability to close deals.

And the third trend is that moving forward it will be key for CEOs to predict how disruption and geopolitical change affect demand generation and customer acquisition. Long-term changes such as those brought by pandemic or the evolution of two distinct digital ecosystems on in the US and the other in China will inform decisions about markets technology investment and supply chain for tech CEOs looking to accelerate growth.

The main challenges facing tech CEOs

Although tech CEOs will face many challenges throughout 2021 Gartner outlines two more urgent ones for leaders to begin strategizing for:

Positioning does not fit new market realities Thanks to the abrupt global downturn reduction in productivity and pressure on technology budgets tech CEOs must reassess their ideal targets and revisit their understanding of buyer needs and ability to differentiate in the market. Growing the business by improving customer acquisition in post-COVID-19 times Cost optimization will be a major initiative for most organizations in the post-pandemic world. Tech CEOs need to position solutions to capture ‘smarter spending’ initiatives to acquire new clients and retain existing ones.

Actions for CEOs to prioritise in 2021

Given the challenges tech CEOs will encounter Gartner recommends CEOs consider these two actions to help move the organization in the right direction:

Embrace new technology partnerships and application ecosystems to drive growth

Collaborate with partners to create or participate in ecosystems that can elevate the value and competitiveness of every party involved. Tech CEOs must be prepared to address four key realities:

Buyer demands for whole-product solutions

Increasingly regional technology ecosystems

Importance of defensive marketplace strategies solutions

The need for delivery supply chain continuity

Support the shift to contingent and diverse workers collaborating with AI in virtual workspaces

Adapt organizational policies and procedures to foster the agility and innovation of contingent labour and increasing diversity across the organization. Identify and invest in AI to discover scenarios where human and AI workers can collaborate in virtual workplaces.

To summarise Gartner offers five essential areas of focus for tech CEOs moving further into 2021 and beyond.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pdHdlYi5jby56YS9hcnRpY2xlL3RoeWNvdGljLW5hbWVkLWEtbGVhZGVyLWluLWdhcnRuZXItMjAyMC1tYWdpYy1xdWFkcmFudC1mb3ItcHJpdmlsZWdlZC1hY2Nlc3MtbWFuYWdlbWVudC9kZ3A0NXFhNlJQbHZYOWw40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thycotic named a leader in Gartner 2020 Magic Quadrant for Privileged Access Management,"Thycotic is proud to announce that we have been named a leader in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Privileged Access Management based on our ability to execute and completeness of vision.

The Aga Khan Hospital Dar es Salaam (AKHS) has installed GE Healthcare’s Senographe Pristina a more advanced and comfortable mammography system for patients with next-generation 3-D digital technology for the first time in Tanzania.

Designed by a team of female GE Healthcare engineers who used their own insights coupled with feedback from more than 1000 other patients technologists and radiologists Senographe Pristina helps to address the fear of discomfort that women face around mammograms.

The system offers comfort features for a better patient and technologist experience including rounded corners instead of sharp edges that used to poke patients’ ribs and armpits and armrests for women to lean on instead of conventional handgrips so women can relax their muscles during the exam which simplifies positioning compression and image acquisition.

Speaking during the launch Mr. Sulaiman Shahabuddin Regional Chief Executive Officer Aga Khan Health Services East Africa said radiology department at AKHS has been a pioneer in investing in advanced technologies to enhance diagnostics which play a key role in modern day management of patient.

“We were proud to be the first to start MRI services in the country initiated provision of image guided minimally invasive procedures including biopsies and drainages installed a first ever complete Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) and Radiology Information System (RIS) and the only private institution with a Cardiac Catheterization lab Radio Nuclear Medicine & Chemotherapy suite"" he said.

Mammograms play a key role in the detection of breast cancer a disease if caught earlier is more likely curable. This ultra-modern unit will further boost the efforts of the institution to not only increase awareness with screening campaigns performed every first Saturday of the month but will also aid in early detection of the disease.

Chief guest Dr. Daisy Majamba Regional Dental Officer Dar es Salaam said breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women after cancer of the cervix and second leading cause of cancer mortality among women in Tanzania.",,,,,,,,,,,,

GEN,Gen Digital,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2dpdG1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9ibG9nL2hvdy1nZW4tei1zaG9wc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Gen Z shops | Diggit Magazine,"Baby boomers Gen X Millennials and Gen Z; each new generation has their own attitudes beliefs and behaviors towards shopping. Gen Z people born between 1995 and 2010 commands $143 billion in buying power. This is almost 40 percent of all consumer shopping. Half of this generation has not even entered the job market yet. Gen Z’s impact does not stop here. According to parents of the Gen Z generation ninety-three percent of the parents say that their children influence household spendings. Almost three-fourths of the parents ask their Gen Z children for their advice before they make purchasing decisions. Gen Z thus has a lot of influence in today’s consumer market.

Digital natives

Gen Z has grown up in a digital world which has made technology the center of their lives. Gen Z has integrated social media and technology into their everyday lives. This generation uses more than one device at the same time; they have to be connected at all times (Goldring & Azab 2020). This means that they may be watching TV while checking their smartphones while doing a homework assignment. These different technologies are intertwined in their lives and result in ultra-distractedness. Because of all the distractions Gen Z is facing it is difficult to get and maintain the attention of Gen Z. Gen Z’s attention span is only 8 seconds which is even less than Millennials’ 12-second attention span. Omnichannel marketing is crucial as Gen Z expects to consume products at any time and place. It is crucial to be everywhere where Gen Z may want to shop or gain information. Social media apps stores advertisements; companies have to be in all places. Omnichannel marketing is important to attract attention on different platforms and to have more touchpoints where potential customers can come in touch with your brand. Being active on all relevant touchpoints means that a brand has more ways to attract Gen Z’s attention.

Digital-first consumers

Gen Z is exposed to products on social media all day long. When they have found an interesting new product on Instagram they will head to YouTube to see reviews. Or they will read the reviews of other customers on the website of the brand. This is what we call a ‘digital first consumer’. Digital consumers use digital media as their preferred first source to acquire information when they are making purchasing decisions. However digital first consumers are not just Gen Z; Millennials Generation X and baby boomers will search online for information as well. Because of the importance of searching for product information online companies need to have all the necessary information out there. Companies have to control the narrative about their products. That is why as a company it is important to reply to reviews and comments both good and bad ones.

What does Gen Z value from brands?

Gen Z expects personalization

Personalization is key to getting the attention of Gen Z. According to Smith (2017) personalization is valued by Gen Z not only for entertainment but also to provide them with relevant information. If Gen Z gets personal benefits from personalization they are more likely to give marketers more access to their personal information. Tailored product suggestions are also valued by Gen Z (Smith 2017). Tailored suggestions allow Gen Z consumers to spend less time searching for products. A personalized shopping experience is valued because Gen Z’s needs are attended to. 54 percent of Gen Z consumers feel special when the content they receive is aligned with their individual needs. Valuing their individual needs will show them that a company understands them.

Personal data is needed for personalization. Bear in mind that Gen Z does value their privacy. Interactions Consumer Experience Marketing (2016) found that fifty-nine percent of Gen Z consumers avoid shopping at a retailer that has been hit by security breaches. Because Gen Z grew up in the digital world they know better than anyone that what goes on the web stays on the web.

That is why it is vital to be transparent about collecting Gen Z consumers’ data. Building trust is important. Show that as a company you are taking the appropriate measures to protect personal data. Emphasize that you are committed to keeping their data safe. This will make Gen Z consumers feel like they can trust their data to your company.

Interaction and engagement

Older generations such as baby boomers and Generation X often got one-way communications from brands. There was no possibility to directly reply to an advertisement in a newspaper or a TV commercial. Nowadays two-way interaction and engagement are essential for companies as well as for customers. Gen Z is eager to interact with its favorite brands. For Gen Z to interact with a brand their videos advertisements blog posts and social media posts need to be interesting visually appealing and engaging. Furthermore customers will engage more if the brand engages with them as well. Engagement and interaction build brand loyalty customer retention and a community. To attract Gen Z interaction and engagement should be a central element in a company’s marketing strategy. Besides engaging with customers will allow a company to learn from them. Interacting with customers provides a gold mine of information.

Gen Z values interaction. This means that they want to feel like they are talking to another person at the other side of the screen. Standardized automated and generalized messages are not appreciated by Gen Z. Companies have to make sure that their replies to consumers are ‘on brand’ while still making the replies personal. When customers feel like the company ‘knows’ them they are more likely to interact more with your brand. By addressing them in a personal way they can become brand advocates for your company.

Authentic brands

Gen Z values brands that are trustworthy transparent and authentic. Goldring and Azab (202) go on to argue that Gen Z expects companies to provide an authentic brand with a reliable outlet of information. This means that interactions and engagement with customers have to be authentic. The Shelf Team (2020) argues that when brands do not use photo-editing customers will see them as more authentic. What also contributes to a more authentic brand identity is the use of influencers as well as happy customers. Influencers and customers are easier to identify with than celebrities. Customers will see influencers and customers as their ‘friends’ and they will trust their opinions to be authentic.

Gen Z expects brands to “take a stand”

Gen Z not only looks at whether or not a product or service is within their budget. Gen Z is also interested in what a brand stands for and what its view is on societal issues. The reason for this being that Gen Z is interested in societal issues themselves and stands up for these issues when needed. Francis & Hoefel (2018) argue that it is important for brands to choose issues that fit with the brand and take a stance towards these issues. They argue that for Gen Z consumers it is important that “a company’s actions (…) match[es] its ideals and those ideals must permeate the entire stakeholder system” (Francis & Hoefel 2018).

Saying that as a company you find certain issues important is not enough. Gen Z values companies that act according to their values. These digital natives will find out when the company’s actions do not match the issues they say they support. This can go as far as getting “your brand name slandered all across social media” (The Shelf Team 2020). Gen Z is not scared to share their opinion. As a company you do not want that since that will be bad for your brand identity and your perceived authenticity. So if your company has not yet taken a clear stance towards several societal issues that fit your brand you need to take a clear stance. Whereas older generations may have condoned a refusal of taking a stance Gen Z consumers will not accept it if your brand does not take a stance.

Why does Gen Z shop?

Central to Gen Z consumers is their expression of their individual identity. For Gen Z consumption becomes a way of self-expression. Gen Z is willing to spend more money on products that show their individuality. According to Interactions Consumer Experience Marketing (2016) seventy-seven percent of Gen Z consumers prefer unique products over popular products. This is in line with the need they feel to express their individual identity. Expressing their own identity has also become important as a result of societal issues regarding inequality. Gen Z is actively concerned with inequality and racism.

What is different between Millennials and Gen Z is that for Gen Z money is a huge motivator. That is why they already start working while they are still in school. Many millennials on the other hand did not work while studying. Gen Z has a different mindset than previous generations. According to The Shelf Team (2020) Gen Z will find ways to increase their incomes so they can buy products that they really want. For companies it is important to find ways to make their products attractive to Gen Z. Because if they find it attractive they will find a way to buy it.

How to do business with Gen Z?

The digital natives are active all over the internet. They use multiple devices at once which results in a short attention span. With an attention span that is even shorter than Millennials’ attention span every moment counts when marketing to Gen Z. That is why it is important that as a brand you use their precious time carefully. The brand’s content must be tailored towards Gen Z. Visually appealing content makes it interesting for Gen Z to focus their attention span on your company’s content. A brand’s content should immediately attract Gen Z’s attention; otherwise they move on to other brands that use more attractive content. Whereas older generations sometimes discuss TV advertisements when they see them Gen Z oftentimes cannot even remember the advertisements that were played during the breaks of the show that is on TV. The reason for this is that the advertisements are either not attention-grabbing or that Gen Z is focusing their attention on the other devices which they are using simultaneously.

Interact and engage with Gen Z across all touchpoints with them. They value the personalized engagement of brands. So when Gen Z leaves reviews of a product or service it is important to respond to them. When the reviews are bad; help them to find a solution and listen to their problems. This is beneficial for both the customers as well as for the company itself. Solving a problem will result in customers becoming brand advocates. For companies it will be beneficial since potential future customers value other customers’ opinions. Other peer customers’ opinions about products are a vital element of consumers’ purchasing decisions (Dabija & Lung 2019). If there are only bad reviews without replies from the company potential customers will turn away towards other brands that are more valued by their peers. Gen Z is not afraid to vocalize their opinions which is why companies must act upon that.

Whereas in the beginning marketers thought Gen Z was an extension of Millennials Gen Z is a very different generation. Companies should not underestimate the power of Gen Z on the consumer market. Even though Gen Z consists of young people they have a big influence on the entire consumer market. They control 40 percent of the market and they influence other generations as well. Gen Z can be seen as a generation of influencers sharing their honest opinions with others and advising their parents on purchasing decisions. That is why it is of vital importance for companies to adjust their marketing strategy. Gen Z will make up even more of the consumer market when they get older which means that it is important to have a marketing strategy ready for them.

We can confirm that the resolution and performance targets mentioned in our original piece hold true: the performance and ray tracing modes target 60fps at 1080p resolution while the quality mode targets a maximum 1800p instead with the same 60fps aspirations. However dynamic resolution scaling is in full effect on this title and results in actual play are quite variable. As you'll see in the embedded video below it can make ascertaining differences between the various modes somewhat challenging. All told for those interested in Series X comparisons PlayStation 5 generally runs a touch smoother than Series X likely by virtue of its lower resolution targets. This is especially evident in the ray tracing mode. Meanwhile Series X has a resolution advantage.

However delivering an actually locked 60 frames per second experience seems to be beyond both versions and the reasons behind this are puzzling. In the embedded below we share some theories about this - I recommend checking it out.

Original Story: Crysis Remastered is being patched with support for the new wave of consoles and Digital Foundry managed to get access to Xbox Series X and Series S builds of the upgrade ahead of launch. Owing to the way 'back-compat plus' titles are distributed we can't check out the PlayStation 5 build until it launches but thankfully the wait there shouldn't be too long: we were informed today that the patch is out now - and we'll update this article with PS5 impressions as soon as we are able.

Similar to the recently released 2.1 update for the PC version there are plenty of additions tweaks and improvements to the game beyond the support for the new consoles. Taking pride of place in the list of upgrades is the inclusion of the Ascension level a stage so taxing that it was previously removed entirely from all console versions of the game. Also welcome is the inclusion of Nanosuit mode swapping more in line with the PC original (this may have arrived in a prior update but certainly wasn't present at launch - regardless it's a nice feature and works well).

However there is the sense that we're still missing some features found in the 2007 game removed for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions and which still haven't been restored for Crysis Remastered. The granularity of destruction found in the original still hasn't been patched volumetrics still aren't on par with the PC original and this effect is completely missing in the resurrected Ascension stage even it is present on the PC version of Crysis Remastered. Other OG Crysis features are also pared back or missing: vegetation animation still runs at a lower update speed than the rest of the game while explosions still don't have any impact on foliage.

Still the headline feature of the update is the support for the new generation of console hardware with both Series consoles benefiting from some potentially cool upgrades. Performance mode tackles 1080p at a target 60 frames per second on both Xbox machines while quality mode aims for 2160p at 60fps on Series X and a capped 30fps on Series S. Meanwhile ray tracing mode runs at best at 1440p60 on Series X with a capped 1080p30 on the junior console. The question is really the extent to which these performance targets are met during play even with the inclusion of dynamic resolution scaling to smooth over difficult-to-render content.

Let's tackle the quality mode first. When I first played this on Series X my perception was of a very smooth experience as I was playing on an LG CX OLED display with VRR enabled. To my mind this delivers the optimal Crysis Remastered experience on Xbox consoles - it's great! However VRR does seem to be doing a fair amount of heavy lifting here: without the feature active we're looking at something more in line with a 50-60fps experience. I'd prefer to see the DRS window widened to get us closer to a locked 60fps. Xbox Series S? I feel 2160p is too high a target even with a capped 30fps - there are too many dips beneath and at this low frame-rate VRR cannot help the experience.

Performance mode is smoother on Series X it's a closer lock to 60 frames per second as you would imagine with its much lower target resolution. However busy areas still see some performance drops - which is surprising bearing in mind the mammoth level of CPU and GPU power being thrown at the game. Series S? It's a disappointment running at between 40-50fps. That's generally better than Xbox One X running in the same mode but there was always the sense that we were CPU limited there a bottleneck that shouldn't apply to Series S. It's a little baffling to be honest. Ray tracing mode doesn't quite hit the target for Series X owners: it's the least performant mode of the bunch with the heaviest drops from the target 60 frames per second to the point where not even a VRR display can smooth over the experience. Interestingly for Series S with its 1080p30 target this actually works out fairly well - it's certainly the most consistent Crysis experience on the lower-end Xbox console.

So ultimately we can't quite achieve the console 60fps dream on Xbox Series consoles with this new patch - and bearing in mind performance levels achieved on Xbox One X that is a little disappointing. However the experience can still impress: quality mode on Series X when paired with a VRR-capable display certainly delivers the goods. As for PlayStation 5 - we're looking at this as soon as the game updates but pre-release Crytek told us to expect 1080p60 in performance and RT modes and 1800p60 in quality mode - all with dynamic resolution scaling in place naturally. Those resolution limits tie into PS4 Pro's equivalent outputs if you're wondering why they're lower than Series X.

According to the leaker Digital Chat Station it might be here sooner rather than later. The device is also now slated to launch in India as well as China and to start at a markedly low ~US$300.

Currently the Realme GT Neo is training on its own in the newly-created Dimensity 1200-phone arena. However its first ever challenger might be about to step in to challenge this premium-mid ranger and it might be sent in there by Redmi. An eminent tipster now asserts that it will launch later in April 2021.

The purported Redmi contender is also slated to match the GT Neo in that it has a flat AMOLED display. This might be the same Samsung E4 panel found in the new K40 flagship line-up from the brand although the gaming alternative might also have physical shoulder triggers. It may also have a 64MP main camera.

The ""Redmi gaming phone"" is also now said to have a code-name (Ares) and a model number (M2104K10x). The latter has allegedly turned up with I as its final letter which may mean this variant is to launch in India. It is rumored to launch under the POCO name in this market.

Should this be the case it might be an F-series device within that brand. Then again the phone has yet to appear on any official websites such as those of TENAA or the BIS. Nevertheless Digital Chat Station asserts that it will show up for certification with a 5000mAh battery that charges at up to 65W.

Finally Redmi's inaugural gaming phone is said to be priced at the equivalent of ~US$300 to $380 whereas the Realme GT Neo starts at ~$265 albeit for a 6GB RAM entry-level SKU.

It was the Providence's last.

Built by General Dynamics Electric Boat and launched in 1984 the Providence is now headed toward decommissioning and ""recycling"" as the Navy calls cutting a retired warship up for scrap metal.

According to the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan the Providence is scheduled to be recycled in the 2022 budget year.

The Providence is the oldest fast-attack submarine commissioned into the Navy on July 27 1985. Fast-attack subs perform several types of missions including anti-submarine and anti-surface-ship warfare as well as launching Tomahawk cruise missiles at land targets delivering special operations forces and conducting surveillance. The Providence was the first Los Angeles-class submarine with vertical launch tubes for deploying Tomahawk missiles.

It is 362 feet long and 33 feet wide with a crew of 134 including officers and enlisted sailors.

It is the fifth U.S. warship named for Rhode Island's capital. And just like the city which is known for its restaurant scene the Providence stood out for its chow winning the Navy's Ney Award for best food service in the fleet. It took the top prize in 2009 and 2010 as well as being a runner-up or honorable mention afterward.

During its final deployment it was underway for 212 days with 97% of the first five months being spent at sea in the western Pacific Ocean.

“We steamed over 50 thousand miles which is equivalent to twice around the world” its commanding officer Cmdr. Michael McLaine said in a news release upon its homecoming.

During its career the Providence achieved several navigational milestones including circumnavigating the globe transiting the Suez and Panama canals and transiting under the arctic ice cap.

In July 2008 the Providence surfaced at the North Pole commemorating the 50th anniversary of the first nuclear-powered sub the Nautilus becoming the first vessel to reach a position of 90 degrees north latitude in August 1958.

At its Aug. 4 1984 christening the Providence's sponsor was Jean W. Smith wife of former U.S. Attorney General William French Smith.

The Providence is mentioned in the 1986 Tom Clancy novel ""Red Storm Rising.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ2ZGFpbHlwcmVzcy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA0LzExL2V4cXVhZHJ1bS11bnZlaWxzLW5ldy1oZWFkcXVhcnRlcnMtc2NsYS12aWN0b3J2aWxsZS83MTcxMjEyMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exquadrum unveils new headquarters at SCLA in Victorville,"Leave it to the engineers at Exquadrum to develop a special ""formulated” fuse cord to cut the ribbon on the company’s new headquarters at the Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville.

Exquadrum CEO Kevin Mahaffy and President Eric Schmidt were joined by a host of dignitaries and guests at the ceremonial unveiling of the company’s 66000-square-foot facility on Sabre Boulevard on Friday.

Exquadrum paid $4.3 million for the property and did exhaustive remodeling on the building that was constructed in 1955 as a main logistics center for the now-shuttered George Air Force Base.

“This is a milestone for us that will enable the further growth of our company and further demonstrates the aerospace defense and aviation presence at SCLA” said Schmidt who launched Exquadrum with Mahaffy in 2002 in Victorville before relocating shortly thereafter to Adelanto.

'Vital to the national security'

The outdoor ceremony near the front steps of the building included several speakers including U.S. Rep. Jay Obernolte who said as a newly elected member of Congress he’s gotten a whole different perspective on just how important companies like Exquadrum are.

“This facility is vital to the national security of our country” Obernolte said. “The research and the development that’s done here makes our military more competitive makes our industry more competitive and makes our space program more competitive.”

Obernolte said as an entrepreneur he’s “in awe” of the work done by Mahaffy and Schmidt whose business model centers around research and development where there’s a high degree of failure.

Sometimes the projects “work and sometimes they don’t work” said Obernolte the former 33rd District Assemblyman.

Mahaffy recalled growing up in the High Desert as a “dreamer” with heroes like Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla inspiring him to start a great company and team that would turn innovations into reality.

While working his dream job as a research and development engineer at the Air Force Astronautics Laboratory Mahaffy knew he needed to take the next step toward his ultimate dream.

During that time Mahaffy looked for a business partner someone as “crazy” as himself who would leave a steady government job to take a risk in pursuing a dream.

Mahaffy told the audience that he looked down the hall of the Air Force Astronautics Laboratory and shouted “him” as he pointed to Schmidt.

Because of Exquadrum’s past achievements and ambitious future Mahaffy reminded those gathered that he “prophesied” that one day SCLA would be known as the “Southern California Logistics Space Port.”

Exquadrum clients include DARPA Air Force

Exquadrum oversees a wide range of projects and has contracted with private firms and government agencies including the U.S. Air Force the U.S. Department of Defense’s Missile Defense Agency and Defense Threat Reduction Agency Schmidt said.

For example Exquadrum’s $15.1 million contract with DARPA included last year’s successful completion of a second and final hot-fire test of a new rocket being developed for the DARPA Operational Fires advanced hypersonic weapon system mission the Daily Press reported.

The rocket propulsion system for DARPA was tested last year at Exquadrum’s FORGE Rocket Test Facility at SCLA.

First District Supervisor Paul Cook started his address with a bit of comedy when he asked Schmidt and Mahaffy “Where did you get the name Exquadrum? You know it sounds like a diuretic or something.”

Later Schmidt would explain that the word “Exquadrum” is a loose translation of a Latin word for “out of the box” indicating the company's “unconstrained approach to research and development and technical services.”

Cook the former representative for California’s 8th congressional district the seat now held by Obernolte said that some aerospace companies have high production costs and lengthy project turnaround times.

“Turn it over to these guys” shouted Cook as he pounded the lectern gestured toward the Exquadrum owners which drew laughter from the crowd.

“What you’ve done here in so many ways — jobs the economy — but once again you were able to go out and do things and cut through the red tape” Cook said. “As somebody who spent a lot of time in the military we appreciate that. It’s all about the troops and to me it translates into saving lives.”

In 2015 Exquadrum was involved when the Pentagon awarded a $7.2 million contract to General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems Aerospace to develop and test the fireball HAMMER (Heated And Mobile Munitions Employing Rockets) designed to destroy chemical and biological weapons in underground bunkers or weapons storage facilities according to a previous Daily Press story.

The bomb’s concept was patented by Exquadrum and created by Mahaffy who explained how the one-ton bomb is designed to litter the area with hundreds of rocket-propelled fireballs designed to incinerate chemical and biological agents at temperatures over 1000 degrees.

Exquadrum Director of Operations Brian Bowers who oversaw the renovation of the building said his goal was to transform the old warehouse into Schmidt and Mahaffy’s dream of a new corporate headquarters.

Victorville Mayor Debra Jones said the work done by Exquadrum is putting the region on the map and Hesperia Mayor Cameron Gregg thanked Schmidt and Exquadrum for their work.

Assemblyman Thurston “Smitty” Smith said Exquadrum’s multi-million dollar investment in Victorville resulted in 63 “big paying jobs” created in the Victor Valley.

'Eric is everywhere'

Smith praised Schmidt and also Mahaffy whom he called the one “behind the scenes who doesn’t get much recognition because Eric is everywhere.”

Some of Schmidt’s public involvement includes serving the City of Hesperia as mayor and councilman also president of the Victor Valley College Foundation and chairman of the board of the Hesperia Chamber of Commerce.

Attorney and Victor Valley College Board of Trustee Brandon Wood told the audience that Schmidt and Exquadrum have had a direct impact on countless students many who have advanced in their educational goals.

Exquadrum announced in March the donation of 26000 square feet of the new building to VVC to house a regional training center and to potentially expand the College’s SCLA School of Aviation in the future.

Schmidt said the 66-year-old building held many remodeling challenges and a bit of family history as his late stepfather retired Air Force Master Sgt. Edward Kleinlein worked there in 1983 as a stockroom clerk to support his family amid an economic slowdown where he lost his job as a logistics systems manager in the defense community.

Kleinlein who worked on classified programs such as the B-2 Stealth Bomber and served during two wars died in August 2019 at his Hesperia home. He was 83.

Despite a year-long pandemic in which Americans were asked to stay indoors gun violence is on the rise in the United States. In 2020 almost 20000 Americans died by gun violence according to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive (this number doesn’t include self-inflicted gun violence). The organization has already reported more than a hundred mass shootings in 2021with seven of them happening in the span of just seven days CNN reports.

Activists and legislators are pushing for stronger gun legislation and advocates have called for additional solutions to address gun violence through mental health resources and decreased police presence in neighborhoods. But you might not know of another way you can make an impact: your retirement investments. Stock holdings in gun companies are extremely common and if you're not looking closely might slip into your retirement portfolios. Moving your money away from these holdings can make a difference in the fight to change the way guns are purchased and distributed in this country.

Andrew Behar is the CEO of the nonprofit As You Sow a watchdog and investor advocacy group that provides resources for those interested in more socially responsible investing. As You Sow's Invest Your Values tool helps investors rate and reference where their money is going and covers a wide range of topics: environmentally-friendly investing gender equality funds prison-free funds and gun and other weapon-free funds.

SEE ALSO: How your retirement investments can help protect the environment

Behar says that his organization's inclusion of gun-free funds specifically those that contribute to civilian firearms was inspired by the outrage after the 2019 shooting at a Walmart in El Paso which ignited a conversation about gun retailers and open-carry laws after 20 people were murdered. ""The whole thing started out of necessity... We discovered that nobody knew what they owned. It was a revelation to us: What is actually in my 401(k)?"" Behar says. When looking at the thousands of funds included in major retirement plans Behar realized how frequently gun manufacturers and retailers appeared: ""It was an introduction to just how complicit I was in owning a piece of this destructive economy.""

""We discovered that nobody knew what they owned. It was a revelation to us: What is actually in my 401(k)?""

With online tools some personal research and the help of coworkers socially responsible investors can screen their own funds and divest from companies contributing to the growing arms industry.

1. Evaluate your retirement options

Most investment options offered by employers take the form of a 401(k) built out of mutual funds. A mutual fund is a collection of stocks bonds or company holdings that have multiple contributors (you and your coworkers among many others). You might alternatively invest through an Exchange Trade Fund (ETF) which is a similar collection of hundreds or even thousands of stocks traded together. Or investors may use an individual savings plan not connected to their work — things like Roth IRAs solo 401(k) plans or other personal portfolios. In any of these forms you are investing in the success of companies which could be (either directly or indirectly) involved in the arms industry.

For more information on the various investment options check out Mashable's explanation of how your investments can help the environment or NerdWallet's in-depth guide to different investment accounts.

Your employer may offer you a 401 (k) plan through an investment firm like Vanguard Fidelity or Blackrock. Many people choose 401(k) plans with a target date of their retirement age but have no idea what's in those funds. Your employer may also limit which target-date funds you can invest in as part of your 401 (k) plan further restricting your options. Individually managed personal portfolios like IRAs or self-employment options like individual 401(k)s will offer you the most control over your fund options as opposed to the constraints you may find with 401 (k) target-date funds offered by an employer Behar says.

If you're starting a personal portfolio you'll want to look for explicitly gun-free funds or socially responsible investing (SRI) options that include gun-free screens. These might also be in the form of what are called ESG funds which focus on investing in companies that commit to certain environmental social and governance standards.

If you are locked into keeping your investments in a company retirement plan like a 401(k) due to tax reasons you can still be proactive about keeping them as gun-free as possible or request your employer add gun-free options. More on that later.

2. Know how weapons manifest in your investments

When you choose to invest in funds built out of dozens (possibly hundred or thousands) of company holdings you could be contributing to the arms industry in a multitude of ways including various sectors of the industry:

Civilian gun manufacturers

Civilian gun retailers

Arms importers

Arms exporters

Companies involved with military arms contracts

A typical diverse portfolio probably has holdings in many of these areas. Larger plans like S&P 500 funds might not have holdings directly in gun-related companies but many still have ties to weapons stocks. Behar says As You Sow found at least 18 weapons companies connected to the S&P 500 fund.

Behar explains that these investing ""layers""— and the convoluted hierarchy of retirement fund managers within an investor's company itself — leave many confused about what their money is supporting. ""In your U.S. 401(k) plan you own a part of these companies because a fund manager thought they would make big bucks. Many activists and advocates don't know they're investing in these funds"" Behar says.

But while fund managers might explain the presence of gun stock holdings as a good return on your investments they aren't actually guaranteed financial performers. Forbes reported in March that while gun sales have increased in 2021 gun stocks themselves haven't seen any growth.

And regardless of financial gains Behar says investors have the right to know what industries their money is invested in. ""It's about transparency knowing what you own... Data leads to change"" he says.

3. Screen your funds

Now is the time to look at your account itself. Your investments are probably connected fund families — a collection of funds (mutual funds ETFs etc.) all managed by one investment company. An employer will typically offer you the choice of funds within a family like Fidelity Vanguard or American Shares.

As You Sow publishes data on fund families across more than 100 managers including Vanguard Fidelity and Blackrock providing information on total investments and stock holdings in both gun manufacturers and gun retailers from gun-only retailers to big box stores like Walmart.

As one example As You Sow found that across the family of 99 Vanguard funds it analyzed more than $18 billion is invested in gun manufacturers and retail. It has one of the lowest overall scores for fund families on the list meaning that many of its funds are tied up in gun investments.

That doesn't mean every fund in the family is ""bad"" though. Many individual mutual funds on Vanguard's list have zero stockholdings in gun manufacturers and get ""A"" ratings from the nonprofit. Use the overall rating for a fund family as the starting point for finding managers and fund families that are committed to gun-free holdings.

Also some of these managers have rolled out new gun-free investment options. In 2019 after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Blackrock announced two new ETF choices that screen out civilian firearms. And Vanguard began including gun-free screens in a few of its ESG fund offerings.

You might also be investing in index funds which are curated portfolios of a select set of stocks and bonds available to investors. This ""passive"" form of investing is fairly common and simple but you once again run the risk of not knowing exactly where your money is going. Check As You Sow's score of the top 10 index funds or search for your index fund online.

You can also search through As You Sow's general gun-free funds list which includes mutual funds and ETFs to find your investment's rating or peruse the top gun-free funds.

Investors may want to cross reference their fund's investments with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) an international research organization that researches disarmament arms sales and arms control. The organization's Arms Industry Database tracks the top international arms producers and military service companies. According to its 2020 report the top five gun manufacturers are all U.S.-based companies: Lockheed Martin Boeing Northrop Grumman Raytheon and General Dynamics. Check your investment funds for holdings in these companies.

Some asset managers have added gun-free screens to their own databases as well. Search through holdings in Vanguard fund families on its website to find explicit gun stock holdings. You may need to know the stock name or ticker number for the companies you would like to divest from — find those on websites like Marketwatch or Stockcharts.

The ticker symbols for the top five weapons manufacturers according to SIPRI are:

LMT (Lockheed Martin)

BA (Boeing)

NOC (Northrop Grumman)

RTX (Raytheon)

GD (General Dynamics)

Other U.S. companies include Vista Outdoor (VSTO) Sturm Ruger (RGR) Smith & Wesson Brands (SWBI) and AMMO (POWW). Morningstar also has a guide to finding gun manufacturers in your index fund investments and stock portfolios.

You might want to take note of whether or not your investments are screened for all munitions including military contracts or just civilian firearms — figure out which category you'd like to prioritize or include both in your search criteria. As You Sow's Weapon Free Funds site includes both screens while Gun Free Funds aggregates civilian weapon connections.

If you can't find your fund in the database or need help screening the many stocks and holding in your fund ask your asset manager for a breakdown of your investments or contact an external financial advisor to help.

4. Reach out to your employer

Now that you've evaluated a fund's ratings it's time to move your money around. This process might happen incrementally; in most cases some funds in your 401(k) will be better than others Behar says. You may not have perfect options to begin with but you can move your investments over to the better scoring funds (think a ""C"" rating or higher) while you wait for options that get green scores.

Shifting your investments is something you can easily do online. Contact your fund manager a company representative or an outside investment advisor for guidance.

If your employer doesn't offer gun-free funds or if all your options fail the screening process ask to expand your offerings. It's much easier for an employer to add more options than change the funds themselves Behar says. And it might be beneficial to enlist the help of other employees to persuade your employer to add more options. As You Sow recommends forming a coalition of employees to share fund ratings and performance data with your employer or file shareholder resolutions if needed.

The nonprofit's Action Tool Kit includes three other considerations when approaching your employer:

Contact (or create) a company ""corporate responsibility team"" focused specifically on weapon or gun-free investing. Find the right person to speak to: either a plan administrator chief corporate responsibility officer or employee engagement manager. Come prepared with information and questions. A good place to start these conversations is with a clear focused statement: “We want to reduce the future risk of our 401(k) fund choices. We also want to invest in a peaceful future. How can we enhance our 401(k) choices to do so?”

Behar says that you should check back in with your fund manager after three months but changes to fund options could take up to a year. And if you are met with direct resistance start a petition. The Action Tool Kit includes a sample letter to plan administrators or interested coalitions can contact As You Sow directly for assistance.

5. Follow the votes

Remember that your investment options aren't just arbitrarily decided — individuals most likely from your asset manager or company management choose what you invest in and where your employer's financial priorities lie through a process called proxy voting. These are votes on behalf of the shareholders (you) and they decide fund options stocks and more for mutual fund investors.

Make sure your money is aligning with your values by tracking the way your asset managers fund managers or other stock holders use their proxy votes. When fund managers choose to vote for companies that abide by socially responsible investing including gun-free companies they have the power to influence corporate decisions.

Behar says investors have the right to ask that proxy vote decisions are made more transparent to investors. The current acting chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Allison Herren Lee even voiced her intent to have asset managers disclose their votes to the SEC out of concern that these powerful representatives are failing to uphold their commitments to socially responsible investing.

Most funds publish votes from the previous year on their websites. You can also find voting information on the SEC's EDGAR Database but this information is limited to current disclosure laws. Keep up voting conversations with your fund managers throughout the year even after the voting period. Behar says to ask whether or not decision makers are taking into account the concerns (and values) of shareholders or are just making decisions based on financial performance. ""Are they voting with the interests of managers or are they voting along with shareholder advocacy?""

Making it clear that employee values should be a consideration in investment matters is the first step in creating a company culture that is open and progressive Behar says. And with billions of workplace dollars going toward gun stocks this commitment to more socially responsible investing has repercussions beyond the workplace.

Data suggests that pandemic-era eating trends were driven largely by younger consumers. According to a report issued by Coca-Cola (KO) 73% of Gen Z and Millennials admit they've snacked more during the pandemic; Gen X respondents also admitted to snacking (54%) more with Boomers not far behind (representing a 48% jump).

Americans also admitted they will do whatever it takes to get a snack ""at their 'hangriest'"" state the beverage giant's data found with nearly half of the nation saying they would walk over a mile for a sweet or salty snack.

So what exactly was the most craved snack? Well it depends on who was being asked the question — and where they lived.

Coke's data found that more than half of America including both the western and southwestern region crave pizza to go along with Cherry Coke while the majority of Midwest craved potato chips. Separately nearly half of the Northeast craved wings and more than half of the Southeast had a hankering for french fries.

Those findings complimented a recent PepsiCo's (PEP) Frito-Lay survey which noticed a surge in snacking during Super Bowl 2021. According to Frito-Lay’s U.S. Snack Index 40% of Americans said they planned to snack more than they did during Super Bowl 2020. To meet that expected demand Frito-Lay shipped more than 70 million pounds of snacks in the week leading up to the big game.

More 'experimenting' and 'innovation'

Major snack brands including PepsiCo and Coca-Cola among others like Conagra (CAG) General Mills (GIS) Kellogg (K) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) are taking note on the surge in snacking using celebrities to boost interest in some new products.

During Super Bowl 2021 PepsiCo used a minute-long commercial to make a big splash with its new Cheetos Crunch Pop Mix (a blend of both popcorn and its classic Cheetos) with celebrity couple Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher.

Fast-forward to March of this year the company launched its ""spiciest chip yet"" Tostitos Habanero with the help of comedians Kate McKinnon and Dan Levy.

In PepsiCo's fourth-quarter earnings call PepsiCo chairman & CEO Ramon Luis Laguarta noted the company is bracing for a return to ""more of a normal life"" — with a return to physical shopping. That presumably includes more snacking and beverage drinking on items like Pepsi's Marshmallow Cola a collaboration with PEEPS.

Story continues

""I think consumers will go back to experimenting a little bit more and they will be looking for innovation"" Laguarta said. ""We're going to see a small — slow return back to bit more complex portfolios.""

More cooking and baking at home

In early March Pillsbury made its first entry into the cookie aisle with a line of ready to eat cookies with flavors like chocolate chip confetti and peanut butter. The new releases were designed with the company's research that showed ""there are times that a ready-to-eat cookie is preferred"" according to Jeff Caswell president of General Mills Snacks Division.

Although General Mills' net snack sales dipped last quarter General Mills said it was optimistic that changes in ""consumer behaviors driven by the COVID-19 pandemic"" are here to stay.

It highlighted ""more time spent working from home and increased consumer appreciation for cooking and baking"" prompting the company to focus on innovation and growing profits in the snack segment.

Kellogg Company is also hoping to profit from the snack boom tapping actor Jesse Metcalfe for the launch of Cheez-It loaded popcorn. The limited-edition item includes two types of loaded popcorns: cheddar and white cheddar.

Meanwhile Lady Gaga-inspired Oreos were one of 2021's first major brand-celebrity team ups. The Chromatica inspired Oreos are filled with green colored creme and feature three brightly-colored designs embossed onto the wafer. In addition the company also released flavors like Java Chip Brookie-O's and Strawberry Frosted Donut among others.

Oreos' parent company Mondelez International (MDLZ) noted in its fourth-quarter earnings report that snack revenue skyrocketed by nearly 80% in 2020 continuing a trend that saw a 75% jump in the year prior and a 60% gain in 2018 according to Nielsen data.

Grocers see ""long-term potential""

This ongoing snacking behavior amplified by diners that are still hesitant to dine out amid a surge in new COVID-19 infections may bode well in the long-run for grocers like Albertsons (ACI) Publix Kroger (KR) and Trader Joe's.

Foot traffic intelligence platform Placer.ai reported ""there is real reason to believe that sector could be heading into an extended period of strength."" According to CMO Ethan Chernofsky ""instead of a picture of decline one of significant long-term potential appears"" wrote in the report.

""Top grocers are actually trending in the right direction and could be heading into a period of unique strength. While COVID’s health effects seem to be dissipating the economic consequences will last far longer. This should buoy grocery as it provides a cost-conscious alternative to eating out"" he added.

Snack stocks like Coca-Cola Pepsi Mondelez and General Mills are perched at or near 52-week highs. Meanwhile grocer stocks like Kroger and Albertsons are up more than 20%.

Even though it was built nearly three decades in the past the Ultralite was a fully functioning vehicle that could achieve upwards of 100 mpg thanks to clever design and innovative technology all without sacrificing on passenger room acceleration performance or emissions.

Unsurprisingly one of the GM Ultralite concept’s greatest strengths is how much it weighs. During the vehicle’s development GM partnered with California-based aerospace company Scaled Composites to produce the Ultralite’s carbon fiber monocoque resulting in a vehicle shell weighing just 420 pounds. The completed concept tips the scales at 1400 pounds and interestingly the concept’s development resulted in a new patent for GM for low-cost carbon fiber production.

In addition to its feathery curb weight the shape of the GM Ultralight is another key component to its efficiency. Thanks to a 0.19 drag coefficient the concept can slice through the air without burning extra fuel to overcome air resistance. By comparison the modern Chevrolet Corvette C8 has a drag coefficient of 0.32 when equipped with the downforce-generating (i.e. drag-heavy) Z51 Performance Package.

Although the GM Ultralite was designed for maximum functionality the form was still a stunning thing to look at and it continues to look modern and futuristic today. The curves are rounded and sleek running together in a single shape with a long windshield circular windows and covered rear wheels.

Notably the Ultralite was featured in the film Demolition Man underlining its sci-fi appeal and although GM never gave the green light for full-time production the design did provide inspiration for the company’s first major effort in modern all-electric vehicles the GM EV1.

Despite its ultra-high fuel returns the GM Ultralite concept still managed to include space for four passengers inside the cabin with ingress and egress made possible via a set of top-hinged gullwing doors. Motivation is sourced from a rear-mounted 1.5L three-cylinder two-stroke engine rated at 111 horsepower enough to send the airy Ultralite to 60 mph in less than 8 seconds with a top speed of 135 mph.

Now the GM Ultralite can be seen on display at the recently reopened Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles.

The announcement came on the day of a deadline set by the United States’ trade representative to decide whether to veto an International Trade Commission ruling in the intellectual property case between LG Energy Solution and SK Innovation. The commission’s ruling in favor of LG had threatened SK with a ban on supplying batteries in the country and put its facility under construction in Georgia at risk.

The plant which is still under construction will supply batteries for electric vehicles for Ford and Volkswagen and with the settlement agreement SK is now also free to seek business from other companies.

The dispute had threatened the domestic supply of batteries for electric vehicles. The settlement prevents delays in the development of American electric vehicles and supplies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9uZXdzLmNvbS9maXhlZC1vcHMtam91cm5hbC9kZWFsZXJzLWNhbi10YWNrbGUtc3RvY2stYnVkZ2V0LXRyYWluaW5nLWlzc3Vlcy1yZW1vdGUtaW52ZW50b3J5LW1hbmFnZW1lbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How car dealers manage having the right parts for repairs without having too much,"As Earley noted some automakers require dealers to use their in-house technology. But many other dealers that don't have such a requirement use Klugh's PartsEye system.

PartsEye counts a dozen automakers — including Subaru Kia Hyundai Mazda and Mitsubishi — and roughly 5000 dealerships nationwide as customers. The system is compatible with more than 40 dealership management system platforms Klugh says.

Individual dealers pay $695 a month for the service; Klugh says automakers that use the technology typically sell the service to dealerships at a lower price.

PartsEye aggregates purchase data culled from a store's DMS demand history then compares it with purchasing trends at many similarly sized local and regional stores that sell the same brand. It relies on complex algorithms and is akin to machine learning Klugh says.

""The best parts manager only sees movement within his store"" he says. ""But we see it across many avenues of distribution … and can see developing trends that parts managers can't see.""

Crossin says remote inventory management isn't necessarily the end-all and be-all to effective stock management.

""If you interview parts managers you'd probably get a mixed bag of reviews"" he says. ""It's a polarizing topic. Some love it some hate it.""

On the ""love"" side of the ledger Crossin says is that some parts managers appreciate how it helps them run a better inventory or gives insightful stocking suggestions.

""Other parts managers don't like it because they feel it forces them to stock parts that they wouldn't normally stock and they'd prefer to make their own stocking decisions"" he says."

But patient deaths in clinical trials for earlier-line use of Gilead Sciences’ first-to-market Zydelig dashed those hopes. Now in what could be viewed as a redemption of the drug class Bayer’s Aliqopa has safely come up with a success.

Adding Aliqopa to Roche’s Rituxan cut the risk of disease progression or death by 48% in patients with indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (iNHL) who relapsed after at least one prior therapy according to data presented at the virtual American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting.

This showing makes Aliqopa the first PI3K inhibitor to demonstrate superior efficacy in combination with Rituxan with a manageable safety profile in patients with relapsed iNHL Scott Fields Bayer’s head of oncology development said in a statement.

Bayer now plans to file the data to the FDA and other drug regulators to potentially get Aliqopa into earlier second-line iNHL Barry Childs Bayer’s global development lead for Aliqopa said in an interview. The drug currently bears an accelerated approval in third-line follicular lymphoma (FL) based on tumor response data.

The company also hopes the data from the phase 3 Chronos-3 trial can turn that conditional nod into a full one. The confirmatory trial Bayer previously agreed on with the FDA is actually the Chronos-4 study which is testing Aliqopa in tandem with Rituxan and chemotherapy in relapsed iNHL. But Childs said the company will ask the FDA to consider using the current study instead given that it’s also a randomized trial.

RELATED: Bayer gears up to take on Gilead in lymphoma with Aliqopa green light

For a second-line filing Bayer intends to aim for a broader label for the whole iNHL population though the FDA might pick apart each subset of disease Childs and Fields cautioned during the interview.

Aliqopa’s benefits were shared across all prespecified iNHL subtypes in Chronos-3. For FL the risk reduction amounted to 42%. The number was 52.5% in marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) 75.7% in small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and 55.7% in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.

For the larger FL and MZL diseases the subgroup analyses were powered to stand on their own while the two smaller diseases aren’t statistically powered according to Childs. That said “there is consistent treatment effect” he added.

“What we’re requesting of the FDA is that they will consider the treatment effect consistency to be part of their approval decision for the smaller subsets"" he said.

As for the perhaps more important data on Aliqopa’s ability to extend patients' lives Childs said the overall survival data were still immature after a median follow-up of 30 months as neither treatment arm had reached the median survival mark.

RELATED: Watch out Gilead: TG Therapeutics wins FDA nod for potentially safer Zydelig rival

Gilead’s PI3K inhibitor Zydelig entered the U.S. market in 2014 for previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia FL and SLL bearing blockbuster hopes. However the company was forced to cap several trials—including ones equivalent to Aliqopa’s Chronos-3 and Chronos-4—after reports of multiple deaths in its clinical programs in 2016. After that the drug’s sales never picked up totaling just $72 million in 2020.

In Chronos-3 the Aliqopa regimen showed side effects that were generally consistent with the individual drugs according to Bayer. Some of the frequent side effects such as hyperglycemia were transient and manageable the company said.

There was however a relatively high discontinuation rate of 32% in the Aliqopa arm versus 8% for solo Rituxan. The company is still exploring the exact reason but Childs pointed to a higher rate of complete tumor clearance among Aliqopa patients suggesting that some investigators may have chosen to discontinue patients—especially during the pandemic— because they were already in good remission. He also noted that the company took a very conservative protocol to discontinue patients who developed pneumonitis but only later realized that the side effect could be managed without taking patients off treatment.

RELATED: Bayer unveils first look at its post-Xarelto post-Eylea life—and it's better than expected

In terms of managing side effects Childs pointed to Aliqopa’s intravenous administration—versus Zydelig and other PI3K inhibitors’ oral dosing—as an advantage as it can be given intermittently to allow normal tissues to recover between doses.

So far Aliqopa still hasn’t earned a place in Bayer’s annual report meaning that its 2020 sales were below the €262 million ($312 million) prostate cancer drug Xofigo raked in during the period. Elsewhere in the class Verastem Oncology recently transferred its PI3K drug Copiktra to Secura Bio for $70 million upfront. That drug sold merely $9.3 million in the first half of 2020. TG Therapeutics meanwhile just got a go-ahead for Ukoniq and Incyte’s waiting in the wings with parsaclisib.

But as Bayer pharma chief Stefan Oelrich laid out at a recent investor event the German company expects to see about €500 million in Aliqopa peak sales. With the Choronos-3 win Bayer may now seek to move Aliqopa into earlier lines of treatment and to markets beyond the U.S. Fields said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2luZGlhL2luZGlhLWJhbnMtZXhwb3J0cy1hbnRpLXZpcmFsLWRydWctcmVtZGVzaXZpci1jb3ZpZC0xOS1jYXNlcy1zdXJnZS0yMDIxLTA0LTExL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India bans exports of anti-viral drug Remdesivir as COVID-19 cases surge,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-bans-exports-anti-viral-drug-remdesivir-covid-19-cases-surge-2021-04-11/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2luZGlhL2luZGlhLWJhbnMtZXhwb3J0cy1hbnRpLXZpcmFsLWRydWctcmVtZGVzaXZpci1jb3ZpZC0xOS1jYXNlcy1zdXJnZS0yMDIxLTA0LTExL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzQvMTEvaW5kaWEtYmFucy1yZW1kZXNpdmlyLWV4cG9ydHMtYXMtY292aWQtMTktY2FzZXMtY29udGludWUtdG8tcmlzZdIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvMjAyMS80LzExL2luZGlhLWJhbnMtcmVtZGVzaXZpci1leHBvcnRzLWFzLWNvdmlkLTE5LWNhc2VzLWNvbnRpbnVlLXRvLXJpc2U?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India bans remdesivir exports as COVID-19 cases surge,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.aljazeera.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Centre has prohibited the exports of injection Remdesivir and Remdesivir Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) in an order issued on Sunday stating that there has been a sudden spike in demand for injection Remdesivir used in treatment of COVID patients.

“India is witnessing a recent surge in COVID cases and there is a potential of further increase in demand for injection Remdesivir in the coming days” said the Centre in a statement.

Seven Indian companies are producing injection Remdesivir under voluntary licensing agreement with M/s. Gilead Sciences USA. They have an installed capacity of about 38.80 lakh units per month.

The release issued by the Health Ministry noted that to ensure easy access to the injection all domestic manufactures of Remdesivir have been advised to display on their website details of their stockists/distributors to facilitate access to the drug.

“Drugs inspectors and other officers have been directed to verify stocks and check their malpractices and also take other effective actions to curb hoarding and black marketing. The State Health Secretaries will review this with the Drug Inspectors of the respective States/UTs” added the release.

It added that the Department of Pharmaceuticals has been in contact with the domestic manufacturers to ramp up the production of Remdesivir.

The World Health Organization (WHO) last year in November found no evidence that the drug improved survival and other outcomes in Covid-19 patients.

Several states in India have reported a shortage of the drug following a rise in its demand amid a record surge in Covid-19 infections across the country.

Here's a brief timeline mapping the drug's journey:

Remdesivir originally developed to treat hepatitis C and subsequently tested against Ebola initially made the headlines during the early stages of research into the coronavirus disease treatment. It was WHO that first hit the brakes on Remdesivir's prospects on November 20 last year recommending that doctors avoid using the drug altogether.

""There is currently no evidence that Remdesivir improves survival and other outcomes in these patients” the WHO noted citing detailed studies it sponsored. “The evidence suggested no important effect on mortality need for mechanical ventilation time to clinical improvement and other patient-important outcomes.” Even so Gilead Sciences Inc the drug's manufacturer pushed back saying it stood by Remdesivir and citing other studies supporting its efficacy.

Gilead which manufactures the drug under the brand name 'Veklury' issued a statement saying that it was ""disappointed"" in the WHO guidelines which the company said ignored “robust evidence” from multiple randomised controlled studies published in peer-reviewed journals that demonstrate its benefits. The company also listed key findings from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ (NIAD) ACTT-1 trials which showed that the drug led to a ""five-day faster recovery in hospitalized patients overall and a seven-day faster recovery in people who required oxygen support at baseline compared with placebo."" The findings from these trials were peer-reviewed and published in the New England Journal of Medicine the company said adding that the anti-viral drug's inclusion has been supported in multiple treatment guidelines. The data has also supported regulatory approvals or temporary authorisations to treat Covid-19 in approximately 50 countries worldwide it said.

Speed is prized in the race to beat back Covid-19. In December later that year researchers from University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom gave the drug to a patient with Covid-19 and a rare immune disorder and observed a dramatic improvement in his symptoms and the disappearance of the virus. The journal Nature Communications carried the new study and soon several countries including India were reported to be using the drug banking on the insight. Remdesivir researchers suspected was likely to be the most beneficial when administered early in infection before the virus is able to trigger a potentially catastrophic immune response.

As Covid-19 cases in India surged so did the demand for Remdesivir and with it came indiscriminate usage hoarding and black marketers causing artificial shortage to jack up prices. In a press conference this week Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said that the drug was being used indiscriminately without following appropriate official protocols. ""The state is getting 50000 doses every day and all of them are being consumed leading to the shortage"" said Tope adding ""Pharmacists and stockists might be doing black marketing and that needs to be checked.""

The anti-viral dose was being used to treat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) patients before it was directed for Covid-19 treatment last year. Currently doctors and hospitals are prescribing the injection even for those suffering from the mild problem of breathlessness Tope said adding that it’s a violation of the protocol. The minister directed all district officials to ensure that every injection is used judiciously and cap the prices to check illegal hoarding.

The owner of a medical store in Maharashtra's Parbhani district was arrested last Thursday for selling a single vial of Remdesivir for ₹6000 a much higher price than the MRP of ₹4800. To overcome a panic over the shortage of Remdesivir and to prohibit the black marketing and stocking of the drug hospitals in Pune have been asked to provide the injection to the patients as opposed to their family members or relatives buying the drug.

The issue is not just limited to Maharashtra. As per a Reuters report India's drug regulator the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) and several state governments in the recent days raised concerns over the hoarding and black marketing of Remdesivir which in some instances is being sold at over 10 times the maximum retail price. Social media posts on Sunday showed large queues of people in the western state of Gujarat waiting to buy Remdesivir injections for Covid-19 patients. Madhya Pradesh too had people queueing up outside medical stores for the drug with some of them agitated at not getting it blocking a road in Indore for a brief period on April 9.

Presently seven Indian companies have licensed the drug from Gilead Sciences with an installed capacity of about 3.9 million units per month for local use. In a statement the government asked manufacturers to step up supplies and informed that for now the export of Remdesivir will remain banned ""till the situation improves""."
GPN,Global Payments,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vYXdzLmFtYXpvbi5jb20vc29sdXRpb25zL2Nhc2Utc3R1ZGllcy9iYnZhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BBVA Case Study,"When developing new financial technologies BBVA must factor in time for PCI DSS certification and audits which can lengthen project timelines and hinder innovation. The company often strategizes ways to overcome these barriers. “We look for solutions that reduce the time and cost of required audits and do not put company goals or projects at risk” says Sanz. To develop a globally compliant NFC payment feature in its mobile app BBVA turned to AWS.

Founded in 1857 BBVA is present in 35 countries including Mexico Spain Turkey and Peru. BBVA’s goal is to provide accessible simple-to-use financial services solutions to address customers’ needs and it has been recognized as one of the world’s best investment banks for sustainable finance. Compliance with international and country-specific regulations such as Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requirements is an important part of BBVA’s business. “PCI DSS regulations are not the only standards we have to meet” says Alfredo Sanz San Juan technical manager of global payments and head of the GP2 platform at BBVA. “Global regulatory bodies have their own certifications and requirements which are sometimes stricter than those of PCI DSS.”

To enable NFC payments BBVA needed a hardware security module (HSM) to manage certain security keys. This requirement created a roadblock for the BBVA team. “The HSM was a challenge for us” says Sanz. “These types of machines are uncommon and have specific and expensive hardware. It is also difficult to scale these systems on premises.” BBVA confronted this problem by building a solution using AWS CloudHSM—a cloud-based HSM that makes it simple for developers to generate and use their own encryption keys on AWS. “Using AWS CloudHSM we were able to comply with NFC key management requirements without sacrificing high-quality service” says Sanz. “On AWS we can scale to meet high levels of demand by auditing or removing HSM instances based on our current needs.”

After developing this initial project the BBVA team quickly realized it needed to change course. “We realized our architecture was operating over capacity” says Sanz. “This fact pushed us to develop a solution that would work for more than one use case at a lower cost.” So BBVA implemented Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)—which provides the flexibility to start run and scale Kubernetes on AWS or on premises—as its core architecture. BBVA uses Amazon EKS to scale dynamically based on real-time demand reducing its operational costs by 80 percent compared to the first solution it developed.

Many AWS services are PCI DSS certified including AWS CloudHSM which made it simpler for BBVA to achieve PCI DSS certification. Additionally the AWS shared responsibility model—an agreement that shares security and compliance responsibilities between AWS and its customers—saved resources during BBVA’s development process. “Using the AWS shared responsibility model we considerably reduced the time and scope of the PCI DSS audit” says Sanz. “All points related to physical security and hardware and even the databases were kept out of the scope of the audit because AWS services are PCI DSS certified.” It took 2 months for the GP2 solution to receive PCI DSS certification a process that would have taken twice as long with an on-premises solution. “We can fulfill several PCI DSS certification requirements by using AWS” says Sanz.

Moreover BBVA can deploy and implement features in several countries simultaneously on AWS. If a feature does not work as expected the company can turn it off quickly enabling a more agile and flexible development environment. “We have built solutions that improve the way our customers make payments” says Sanz. “With this scenario we are able to adapt more accurately and dynamically to real-time demand. And in all this of course we can maintain full PCI DSS compliance.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9maW50ZWNoLWludmVzdG1lbnRzLzIwMjEvc291dGgtYWZyaWNhLXRlbGNvLW10bi10YXJnZXRzLTUtYmlsbGlvbi1mb3ItbW9iaWxlLW1vbmV5LWV4cGFuc2lvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,South Africa Telco MTN Targets $5 Billion For Mobile Money Expansion,"South Africa-based MTN the mobile phone company has plans to value its mobile money arm at over $5 billion a report from Financial Times (FT) says.

The company is preparing to sell or list a minority stake in order to draw more global investors who are seeking to capitalize on quickly-growing FinTech assets.

MTN currently has 280 million global subscribers and added almost 12 million new users to its mobile money arm for a total of over 46 million in 2020.

Ralph Mupita company chief executive said that the unit should be worth at least $5 billion to $6 billion. He said the group would be spinning it out within the next year.

MTN is listed in Johannesburg and had rolled out the separation plan last month as part of a shift in strategy. The shift will cut $3 billion in net debt FT reports.

The group is aiming to tap into the burgeoning investor interest for the mobile money business built up by African telecoms over the past decade which allow phone subscribers to send or receive money outside of banks and more often sell ancillary services including microinsurance.

MTN’s mobile money business has over double the 21 million users of rival Airtel Africa FT writes and the group’s financial services interests also have an insurance joint venture with more than 10 million customers.

With the move MTN is also anticipating some regulatory scrutiny in Africa with more complex financial services wholly owned by mobile phone companies.

MTN rival Airtel Africa has recently closed a deal for $100 million which gave Mastercard a 3.75 stake in its business and valued it overall now at $2.65 billion.

Raghunath Mandava chief executive officer (CEO) of Airtel Africa said the investment from Mastercard would help the company’s mission of reaching underserved regions with new financial tools.

That investment also boosted the company’s existing relationship with Mastercard including “extended commercial agreements” and an updated “commercial framework” for numerous geographies and payment methods.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JsZC01NjY4NzczNtIBK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JsZC01NjY4NzczNi5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prince Philip: World leaders and royals send heartfelt sympathy,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuZHAub3JnL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3VuLWNhbGxzLXVyZ2VudC1hY3Rpb24tZGVidC12YWNjaW5lcy1hcm91bmQtd29ybGTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UN calls for urgent action on debt vaccines around the world,"Washington —The United Nations called this week for expanded debt relief to all developing countries that request it and faster more equitable COVID-19 vaccinations to tackle “unprecedented” fallout from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

“To avoid a development crisis the world must avoid a debt crisis” UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said on behalf of the United Nations in statements to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Development Committee and to the International Monetary and Financial Committee Board of Governors gathered virtually for their yearly Spring Meetings. “This is no time for austerity.”

Speaking on behalf of the UN Secretary-General Steiner also noted that that 84 percent of COVID-19 vaccines administered so far have gone to wealthier countries and urged swift measures to close major gaps in vaccine funding and production for poor countries.

While the world’s largest economies have mobilized an historic US$18 trillion in fiscal support keeping people and economies afloat amid surging poverty joblessness and hunger many developing countries cannot invest in recovery and resilience because of financing constraints Steiner said.

“The least developed countries have spent 580 times less in per capita terms on their COVID-19 response than advanced economies. This division is starkly reflected in global access to vaccines. The work is not done until vaccines are in arms around the world and until the divergent paths of recovery correct course.”

The United Nations is calling specifically for stakeholders to offer legal and technical advice on options for debt and debt service relief expand debt relief eligibility to include additional vulnerable countries on a case-by-case basis and consider other mechanisms that would allow countries to access debt relief without jeopardizing their credit ratings.

“The economic and social costs of the COVID-19 pandemic have been unprecedented” Steiner said noting that the global economy contracted 4.3 percent in 2020 significantly more than during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Echoing the Secretary-General’s call for debt relief he urged governments and creditors to extend liquidity and debt relief to all developing countries that request it.

“We are witnessing a two-tiered global response. Among the most vulnerable countries the general availability of vaccines could be many months if not years away. The risk of another lost decade of development and a failure to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals is high and rising. To help mitigate this risk… donors must meet their aid commitments and provide fresh concessional financing especially but not only for the poorest countries” Steiner said.

Debt relief must be expanded

“Debt vulnerabilities were already high in many developing economies when the pandemic hit. For many countries debt problems extend beyond what can be handled by short-term liquidity support or debt moratoria as offered to 73 countries by the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI)” he said. The Common Framework on Debt Treatment Beyond the DSSI agreed last year by the Group of 20 largest economies “marks a turning point as it offers a systematic way to restructure unsustainable debt.”

But eligibility for these measures doesn’t extend to a critical number of other vulnerable economies including some middle-income economies and small island development states.

A new UNDP report finds that just under one third of highly indebted vulnerable developing economies are ineligible for these debt relief measures and that these countries account for more than two-thirds of total estimated external public debt service payments at risk from 2021-2025. Specifically 72 countries or 60 percent of all developing economies evaluated are highly debt-vulnerable and 19 severely so. Those 19 economies account for US$220 billion of debt payments at-risk.

The report Sovereign Debt Vulnerabilities in Developing Economies estimates that a minimum US$598 billion of external public debt service payments are at risk from 2021-2025 across the 72 countries studied with US$311 billion owed to private creditors. But the most significant threat it finds is not a string of defaults but the possibility of a prolonged debt crisis that leaves countries with crushing debt burdens for years—preventing governments from making critical investments to benefit their own people and address the climate crisis.

Building back better and more sustainably will also require revamped tax and trade policies along with scaled-up efforts to combat illicit financial flows all of which must prioritize tackling the climate crisis and surging inequalities globally Steiner said.

The IMF and World Bank are urging member countries to keep up fiscal support for their economies and vulnerable citizens and businesses until the pandemic is firmly under control. The IMF has proposed a new allocation of US$650 billion in so-called “Special Drawing Rights” which would provide liquidity to poorer countries in the form of an international reserve.

Socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic have slammed communities globally as the COVID-19 virus and lockdown measures to contain it have forced people to earn less learn less and forego access to essential services. Longstanding wage and labor gaps along with a heavier care burden have meant COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted women—pushing more women than men out of paid employment and prompting a surge in gender-based violence.

UNDP serves as technical lead for the UN system in assessing socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic and devising response plans to address them in collaboration with other UN entities governments International Finance Institutions donors and others. To date 144 socio-economic impact assessments have been completed across 97 countries and these have guided production of 119 response plans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlZGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYmF0dGVyeS1kaXNwdXRlLXNldHRsZW1lbnQvbmV3c1ZpZXcva2VkMjAyMTA0MTEwMDAx0gExaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAua2VkZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzQW1wL2tlZDIwMjEwNDExMDAwMQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SK agrees to pay $1.8 billion to LG settles battery legal dispute,"EV battery system platform Ultium jointly developed by LG Energy and GM

SK Innovation's EV battery plant under construction in Georgia

LG Energy Solution Ltd. and SK Innovation Co. have reached an 11th-hour agreement to end their two-year legal dispute in the US over trade secret infringement and battery-related patent violations.The deal between South Korea’s two leading electric vehicle battery makers comes hours before a US administration deadline to decide whether to initiate a 10-year import ban on SK Innovation's batteries and components to the United States or take the rare step of reversing an earlier international trade body ruling.Analysts say the dramatic settlement will remove uncertainty clouding both companies' US battery projects and also spare President Joe Biden from choosing between undermining intellectual property rights and dealing a blow to his clean energy initiative with an import ban on EV parts.“The two companies agreed to work to help the development of the EV battery industry in South Korea and the US through healthy competition and friendly cooperation” LG Energy Chief Executive Kim Jong-hyun and SK Innovation CEO Kim Jun said in a joint statement on Apr. 11.“Both sides also agreed to make joint efforts to strengthen the EV battery supply chain and the eco-friendly policy the Biden administration is pursuing.”Under the agreement SK will pay 2 trillion won ($1.8 billion) – one trillion won in cash compensation and one trillion won in royalties – to LG. Previously LG Energy wholly owned by LG Chem Ltd. had sought at least 3 trillion won in compensation while SK had capped its payment at 1 trillion won.Both sides have also agreed to drop all lawsuits against each other over the battery-related trade secret and patent violation cases filed since April 2019 in Korea and the US and to refrain from entering into another legal battle over the next 10 years.Each company’s board of directors held an emergency meeting on Sunday and approved the agreements between the two sides.The two Korean EV battery players had been locked in a protracted legal battle in the US over several cases including the allegation of misappropriation by SK of LG’s battery-related trade secrets.Last month the International Trade Commission ruled in favor of LG Energy over the trade secret case . Under its final verdict the SK Group unit was set to be banned from importing some lithium-ion batteries and their components to the US over the next 10 years rendering it almost impossible to run its battery plants in Georgia.President Biden had until the Apr. 11 deadline to decide whether to overturn the import ban or allow it to take effect. He had to choose between two of his key policy issues – his desire to promote EVs to curb climate change and the nation’s longstanding and vigorous backing of intellectual property rights.In a separate case over a battery patent suit the ITC on Apr. 1 gave a preliminary ruling in favor of SK  saying it didn’t violate LG’s battery-related patents.In the run-up to the settlement the Korean rivals made extraordinary efforts to lobby the Biden administration with near-daily meetings in recent weeks involving senior executives and government officials from both South Korea and the US. LG and SK combined reportedly spent more than $1 million on these lobbying efforts in addition to some 1 trillion won in legal costs.According to foreign media both governments put pressure on the two companies to reach a deal while the US Trade Representative (USTR) played a role by arranging meetings with relevant parties as the deadline loomed.More recently SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won and LG Group Chairman Koo Kwang-mo reportedly met in Seoul in late March to negotiate a settlement.Following the settlement both SK and LG are expected to increase their influence in the US battery market by continuing their expansion as planned – a move that will also help the Biden administration limit Chinese battery makers’ growing clout in America.SK Innovation is currently constructing two battery plants in Georgia which will supply EV batteries to Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG. The first plant is set to begin operations in the first quarter of next year with the second plant scheduled for mass production in 2023.Once the two factories are fully operational they will have a combined capacity of 21.5 GWh second only to Tesla Inc.’s 35 GWh Gigafactory in the US.Meanwhile LG Energy which operates a lithium-ion battery factory in Michigan announced last month it will invest more than 5 trillion won ($4.5 billion) by 2025 to expand its US battery business including building a new plant and creating at least 10000 jobs.The new investment will help LG secure a capacity of 70 GWh a year in the US in addition to 5 GWh capacity at the Michigan facility which supplies battery cells to clients such as General Motors Co. Ford and Chrysler.If all its expansion plans are realized LG will become the largest battery maker in the US with its total capacity in the US rising to 145 GWh a year including production from Ultium Cells LLC LG’s joint venture with GM.According to market research firm SNE Research China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (CATL) is the world's top battery maker with 31.7% market share as of February followed by LG Energy Solution with 19.2%. SK Innovation ranks sixth with 5% market share.Jae-Kwang Ahn and Kyung-Min Kang at ahnjk@hankyung.com In-Soo Nam edited this article."

Frankly the karma wasn’t good when it opened last year and it’s been one thing after another ever since right up to Sunday’s 2-0 loss to the Padres to give San Diego a sweep of the weekend.

This all started last year with the delay of GLF’s much-anticipated debut because of COVID-19. The season played out to an abbreviated schedule before a cast of creepy cardboard cutouts denying the owners their anticipated millions and overheated locals a place to weather the summer. Meanwhile the Rangers weren’t even kings of their new castle. That honor belonged to the Dodgers who celebrated a World Series title here.

The Rangers came in behind not only the Dodgers at home but the Padres too. San Diego turned around its season in Arlington and this weekend’s sweep proved the Padres still own the Rangers.

The Dodgers broke a 32-year-old drought by winning the first World Series at GLF then Joe Musgrove took its center stage to throw the first no-hitter in the 53-year-history of the Padres.

Here’s a rule of thumb for you kids out there: Never make someone else’s history for them.

Rangers hitters weren’t much better Sunday than they were Friday even after the Padres’ starter Adrian Morejon lasted just 16 pitches before leaving with a strained forearm. A half-dozen relievers held the Rangers to five hits over 8.1 innings ruining a superlative effort by Mike Foltynewicz in his second start.

Folty bounced back from a four-inning four-run effort against Toronto to give up just one run on two hits and three walks over seven innings Sunday. To give you an idea of what the Rangers wasted Folty became only the third pitcher in club history to take a loss after posting those kinds of numbers.

“You shouldn’t lose a game like that” Chris Woodward said.

But crazy things happen to the Rangers these days. After starting the season with loud bats and lousy pitching they’ve flip-flopped. In three games against San Diego they were shut out twice and managed a total of 12 hits pretty much an average night’s work across the street.

Speaking of which: Do you think all this bad karma could have anything to do with the fact that the Rangers’ spurned history still peeks over its shoulder? Even after a year it’s still a little disconcerting to look out across left field and see Globe Life Park in all its former glory. Like I wrote in GLF’s debut the view seemed an odd feature of the new digs. Like hanging a portrait of your ex-wife in the living room.

Not that I have any complaints about GLF in general. I mean other than the fact that it looks like a gas grill from overhead. Like your mother always said it’s not what’s on the outside it’s what’s on the inside that counts.

Once you get past the fake grass and the birds’ nest of beams hanging overhead it’s a great place to watch a ballgame.

Or a rodeo.

Or a Weezer concert.

Maybe the fact that it’s more of a special events center than a true-blue baseball mecca messed with the karma. They don’t call baseball stadiums “cathedrals” for nothing. You can stage whatever craven event you want in a football stadium and no one cares. Look what Jerry Jones has been doing in JerryWorld all these years.

Or maybe the problem is because the Rangers packed the house for the opener in the middle of a pandemic and keep packing them in. Sunday’s matinee crowd of 26723 came in just under the average of 27309 for the six-game homestand. The sight of 38238 at Monday’s home opener largest at any sporting event since the pandemic hit most seemingly maskless made national headlines for all the wrong reasons.

The Rangers touted their state-of-the-art ventilation system and the fact that they would open the roof when conditions allowed hoping the assurances would mitigate concerns about the risks. Yet on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon they closed the roof because temperatures were projected to reach 85 degrees like that’s unbearable here.

Considering everything that keeps happening — did I mention the governor jilted the Rangers in another headline grabber — does GLF seem like home sweet home?

“A hundred percent” Isiah Kiner-Falefa said. “We’re lucky to have a full stadium. It’s a cool opportunity for us and it’s making us better.

“We’re very lucky.”

Probably best to keep telling yourself that IKF. Better than calling a curse a curse.

On this date in Texas Rangers history the team played its first game at The Ballpark in Arlington which later became Globe Life Park in Arlington. It would be the home of the Rangers for the next 26 seasons.

The game was on April 11 1994 as the Rangers had closed out the Arlington Stadium era (1972-1993) the previous season. The change to the brand-new park came with new uniforms as the Rangers moved away from their blue-and-white uniforms to a red-and-white set up. The Rangers also had a new logo.

The park modeled after ballparks from the past included a short home run porch luxury boxes and enough room for more than 45000 fans. And the game came with all the pomp and circumstance of a first opening day at a new stadium complete with legendary Texas classical pianist Van Cliburn playing the national anthem with the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra. Cliburn won the 1958 International Tchaikovsky Competition and passed away in Fort Worth in 2013.

On this afternoon the Rangers crammed 46056 into the new ballpark for an afternoon game with the Milwaukee Brewers which the Rangers lost 4-3.

Rangers left-hander Kenny Rogers drew the first start in the new ballpark as he threw more than seven innings giving up four runs (three earned) eight hits and walk while striking out three. Brewers starter Jaime Navarro took the win throwing seven innings and giving up three runs (two earned) and five hits while striking out four. A quartet of relievers including veteran Jesse Orosco made the lead hold up.

The Rangers’ batting order for that ballpark opener was center fielder David Hulse second baseman Doug Strange designated hitter Jose Canseco left fielder Juan González first baseman Will Clark third baseman Dean Palmer right fielder Rob Ducey catcher Iván ‘Pudge’ Rodríguez and shortstop Manuel Lee. Six different Rangers had hits with Strange Canseco and Clark each finishing with an RBI.

Also on this date …

April 11 1977: The Rangers opened the home portion of their schedule at Arlington Stadium with a 3-2 10-inning win over Cleveland. Adrian Devine took the win in relief for the Rangers. Second baseman Toby Harrah won the game with a solo home run in the 10th inning while outfielder Tom Grieve hit his second home run of the season a two-out shot in the fourth inning. The Rangers were 4-0 at that point in the season.

April 11 2005: The Rangers opened the home portion of their schedule losing to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 7-6 in 10 innings. It was the first season-opener at the newly-named Ameriquest Field. Kenny Rogers drew the home-opening start giving up three runs and eight hits. R.A. Dickey ended up taking the loss in relief in the 10th inning. Third baseman Hank Blalock and catcher Rod Barajas had three hits each for Texas. Barajas Blalock and shortstop Alfonso Soriano all homered for the Rangers.

Gillette Stadium was empty in 2020. Jonathan Kraft is hoping that COVID-19 vaccinations will change that in time for the 2021 season. Jim Davis/Globe Staff

As more and more Massachusetts residents receive their COVID-19 vaccinations hope for a return to normalcy continues to climb.

Patriots president Jonathan Kraft is among those who are hopeful. Kraft who is also the president of The Kraft Group believes that vaccinations and herd immunity will allow for Gillette Stadium to be at full capacity for this upcoming Patriots season.

“Once vaccines have been available in a community for a long enough period of time where anyone who’s wanted one could’ve gotten it and reached two weeks past their second shot just to take the outlying point then I don’t know why you shouldn’t be at full capacity” Kraft said during one of the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference’s virtual panel discussions on Friday via The Boston Globe’s Michael Silverman. “It’s sort of intellectually dishonest to say we’re going to be at a quarter percent of capacity even though theoretically you have herd immunity in the local population. At some point you have to get back to living your lives.”

Kraft believes that with the regular season not starting for another five months fans who want to get vaccinated will likely be vaccinated by then. which he thinks will allow fans to enter Gillette Stadium.

“As President Biden said April 19 (the vaccine’s) available to everybody in America” Kraft said. “Clearly there’s a backlog so let’s say anybody who really wants it will have it by June 1 or June 15 — we’re still months out from the start of the NFL season (in August).”

Kraft’s recent comment aligns with what his father Robert Kraft said in March. The Patriots owner told reporters then that “I truly hope that we have our herd immunity so we have a full stadium and get back to normal.” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell also said in March that the league expects to have full stadiums next season.

The Patriots were one of nine teams in the league to not have fans in the stands at any point of the 2020 season. Some progress has been made though locally. Massachusetts has started a soft re-opening of allowing fans back in arenas and stadiums. In March the state allowed sports venues to open at 12 percent capacity.

So far only the Texas Rangers have re-opened their stadium to full capacity among teams in the major professional sports leagues. The Rangers made headlines Monday when they hosted a crowd of at least 38000 at Globe Life Field for their home opener making it the first sporting event in America to have such a capacity since the COVID-19 pandemic altered the sports world.

As for on-the-field matters Kraft doesn’t believe changes made due to the pandemic will stick permanently."

From Dakin Campbell:

Goldman Sachs launched its consumer-banking arm five years ago with a marketing blitz and much fanfare sending a strong signal to Wall Street that it wanted to disrupt retail banking — and reshape its own future.

Since then the bank has built it into a $1 billion business by standing up new technologies at breakneck speed.

But now Marcus staffers are quitting in droves at the precise moment the bank needs them most just as it announced a slew of ambitious products and reshuffled its corporate structure to focus on growth.

Former employees as well as banking consultants and an analyst briefed by Insider said the exodus raises questions about Goldman's ability to drive its people hard and still compete with Main Street banks.

HAL,Halliburton,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy56YW5lc3ZpbGxldGltZXNyZWNvcmRlci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDIxLzA0LzExL25hdHVyYWwtZ2FzLWhlbHBlZC1lY29ub215LXByb3NwZXItc291dGhlYXN0LW9oaW8tb2ZmaWNpYWxzLXNheS83MDkwNjUzMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Natural gas helped economy prosper in Southeast Ohio officials say,"ZANESVILLE - Kelly Moore says her story is much like that of many other regional entrepreneurs.

She and her husband are independent owners of three Napa Auto Parts stores. Auto parts stare known to many as places to get windshield wipers or gear up for a DIY oil change.

They offer that although their downtown Zanesville shop operates with about 80% from commercial revenue. Moore has largely contributed that to some of gas industry companies like Halliburton.

But it's not just the gas well service company buying parts to service vehicles and semis. Those 500 employees may want to fix their own cars too. The person repairing air conditioning at the massive facilities needs to keep his work truck up to snuff and oil well servicing requires heavy machinery that needs to be purchased somewhere.

""It's that trickle down that they talk about and it's had a nice effect not just on my business"" Moore said.

As the world shifts away from fossil fuel dependence due to environmental impact and climate change local entrepreneurs say the jobs created weren't limited to those who hold positions in the oil and natural gas industry.

Rather it's a been a ripple effect for jobs and wages in other sectors and local businesses.

Ohio natural gas impacts other sectors

Between 2005 and 2020 marketed natural gas production in the U.S. nearly doubled according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That was in large part due to an uptick in hydraulic fracturing of utica shale a geological formation that underlies portions of Ohio West Virginia Pennsylvania and New York.

Halliburton opened a facility in Zanesville in 2012 has since created at least 500 jobs. AMG Vanadium related to the oil and gas industry is hiring 100 people for its facility opening this summer.

AMG Vanadium:New Zanesville plant will start operating this summer

Utilities are among the highest-paid jobs in Muskingum County. The average annual salary for an industry position is $84774 according to a 2020 Zanesville-Muskingum County Port Authority area profile.

But with the jobs created directly in the oil and gas industry has come economic prosperity in other sectors too.

A towing company might do business with a gas producer and need parts. An excavator needs to maintain heavy machinery with an uptick in business. Heating and cooling contractors need to maintain vehicles to travel to new facilities being built in the region.

Zemba Brothers has been another customer that's picked up their own business with gas companies in recent years Moore said.

A 2020 U.S. Department of Energy report said Appalachia is the single-largest natural gas producing region with 85% of the the growth in U.S. natural gas production over the last decade having been in Northern to Central Appalachia which includes eastern Ohio.

Other companies that have benefitted from the oil and gas industry include Strauss Fence and Dutro Ford. The New Concord-based fencing company installed commercial chain link fence for the Zanesville Halliburton facility. The company previously reported it was one of its larger projects. And the downtown auto dealer in large part was built due to the oil and gas industry demand for parts and vehicle service the owner said at the time.

And those companies have done hiring of their own. Higher revenue means better wages and benefits that make people want to stay on the staff Moore said. ""The thing about small business that I've found we don't have time to keep retraining employees. We have to retain employees.""

And it's not just auto parts. Hotels in the region namely some of Ohio's easternmost counties where more fracking happens have been doing well.

Retail and restaurant industry has been booming in Zanesville in particular. That's because restaurant or retail chains may perform an area profile to decide where they're locating that'll include things like dispensable income and housing market explained Matt Abbott Zanesville-Muskingum County Port Authority executive director.

He added that the county has found generally with every one person hired at a high-paying job around three more jobs are needed elsewhere. ""How many car salesmen do they need to hire (to keep up)? How many restaurant workers?"" he said. ""The ripple effects to these positions really is astronomical.""

Average Muskingum County wages have increased from around $32000 to $420000 since 2011 according to JobsEQ software the county relies on for market data.

A criticized industry creates opportunity

A recently introduced federal infrastructure bill would invest billions into solar and wind farms electric vehicle markets and zero-carbon energy research.

Moore believes the industry is going to continue to move toward clean energy although fuels like natural gas may be around longer than some want.

""I think it's much more gradual than people think it will be otherwise we could be in a world of hurt"" she said.

Hydraulic fracturing has led the expansion in the last decade but it's come under scrutiny for its environmental impact. While federal research generally regards natural gas as a relatively clean burning fossil it's still a fossil fuel and is mainly comprised of methane a greenhouse gas.

That means natural gas drilling runs a risk for air pollution and groundwater — in some cases drinking water — contamination most dangerous in communities where wells are located near homes. Noble County had an incident in January The Columbus Dispatch reported.

Fracking waste had spilled from an oil well in Jackson Township. Containment measures were put in place and around 39000 barrels of fluid were collected and disposed of although the newspaper reported a nearby tributary was initially affected and an unknown number of fish were killed off.

Ohio Southeast Economic Development a private nonprofit JobsOhio partner organization reported the region has more than 3300 permitted wells with 2800 drilled and 2500 producing.

""The oil and gas industry has certainly been good for the region but if you think about eastern Ohio they used to make a lot of steel in eastern Ohio"" OhioSE President Mike Jacoby said. Coal and glass have also declined. ""Now it’s providing a fraction of the jobs it used to.

OhioSE works with various industries including energy like natural gas and solar. The nonprofit's website lists 24 major energy companies it works with in the region.

Although it's not just energy — historically coal now natural gas — that's done well. Other industries have also thrived independently Jacoby added: The eastern and southern Ohio region has a concentration of food processing workforce 81% above the national average Ohio is the No. 1 state for wood furniture manufacturing.

""Certainly eastern Ohio has benefited (from gas jobs) but if you look at our entire region there's going to be different strengths in different parts of our region"" he said. ""It's not just one sector. We've gotten different strengths different competencies.""

A lot of the future is going to be focused on information-based jobs Jacoby added. That's why there's been a push to add broadband in the region but that would help really any business sector.

Natural gas demand is high to heat homes and power electric plants and prices are low due to customer proximity. All three types of gas production — upstream midstream and downstream — have a regional presence.

Because the natural gas industry has had such a positive influence on Moore it's difficult to think about what the future holds if society completely turns to green energy. The store's already added electric car batteries to its stock.

""I think we are transitioning to be less dependent on fossil fuels but it still takes fossil fuels to manufacture those batteries"" she said. But it's not going to happen overnight. ""It's not a light switch by any means.""

Hartford Athletic Goals:



New York City FC concluded their preseason campaign with a comfortable 2-0 win against Hartford Athletic at the Etihad City Football Academy on Saturday afternoon.





The Boys in Blue looked sharp from the first whistle and engineered an early opportunity just minutes into the game when an overload down the left-hand side put Ismael Tajouri-Shradi in on goal – his shot narrowly missing the target.





Ronny Deila’s men continued to play with a speed and intensity that troubled Hartford. Some intelligent passing interchanges allowed NYCFC to play through the lines and saw Maxi Moralez prove to be a constant threat.





The Argentine almost opened the scoring with an audacious chip from 40 yards out but his cheeky effort wasn’t quite good enough to beat his former teammate Jeff Caldwell in the Hartford goal.





NYCFC continued to push their opponents but struggled to find that finishing touch. At the other end Hartford fostered a good opportunity in the 40th minute when forward Sebastian Elney fired a shot into the side netting.





That miss proved costly for the visitors as NYCFC found a breakthrough moments later when good pressing from Tajouri-Shradi allowed him to square it to Taty Castellanos. He in turn played it on to Jesus Medina who fired it past a helpless Caldwell.





Firmly in control NYCFC didn’t have to wait long for a second. This time Moralez was the provider as his delicate cross in the 44th minute found Medina at the back-post. The Paraguayan applied a calm side foot finish into the net from eight yards out to give NYCFC a 2-0 lead at half-time.





The second half saw only one change in personnel for NYCFC as Alfredo Morales replaced Tajouri-Shradi. There was also a change in formation as the Boys in Blue switched to a 3-4-3 system. The hosts started to fashion more chances in the second half but a pair of blocks from Alex Callens and Maxime Chanot denied Hartford a route back into the game.





The 67th minute saw a quintet of new faces enter the field as Tayvon Gray Chris Gloster Andres Jasson Nicolas Acevedo Sebastien Ibeagha replaced Anton Tinnerholm Keaton Parks Gudi Thórarinsson James Sands and Castellanos.





The 81st minute saw Acevedo granted a chance to score after some more good pressing from NYCFC – his effort going high and wide. The game finished 2-0 to NYCFC and saw the team finish with four victories in five outings during preseason. The team will now begin preparation for the MLS season opener against D.C. United on Saturday April 17.

1st 2nd 3rd Final PROVIDENCE 0 0 1 1 HARTFORD 1 2 3 6

HARTFORD CT. - Tommy Cross scored the lone goal for the Providence Bruins as the P-Bruins fell to the Hartford Wolf Pack 6-1 on Saturday afternoon. The loss marks the first defeat for Providence since March 25. The P-Bruins moved to 5-3-1 against Hartford and 13-4-1 overall on the season.

JAY LEACH HEAD COACH

“I thought the first period was okay. We didn’t generate much. I think much because of the fact that Hartford was certainly willing to block shots and defend the right way. We were not willing to get pucks and bodies to the net. On the flip side they were able to get pucks through and obviously they scored a goal.

The second and the third were a real concern. Not a lot of juice there for us - partly I’m sure because of the way that Hartford was playing but also really because our willingness to play inside block some shots and win a couple battles was nonexistent for the last two periods. Give them credit. They certainly did all of those things. They were even blocking shots at the end of the third there. It was clearly a case of two teams that were playing polar opposites of one another. One was all-in and our group was not.”

STATS

- Tommy Cross scored the lone goal for Providence just past the halfway point of the third period. The goal was the third of the season for Cross the P-Bruins all-time leaders in games played. In nine games this season Cross has produced seven points (3G 4A) and has four points (3G 1A) in his last four games.

Please Hasbro make a 3.75” Velken Tezeri in The Vintage Collection Line and put him on a POTF card.

Hasbro has honored us with so many amazing figures and vehicles over the years and very recently Jabba’s Sail Barge – The Khetanna and an all new Skiff Vehicle. (Thank you Mark Boudreaux Steve Evans and the Hasbro Team for bringing these to life). These Vehicles are absolutely amazing additions to our collections and are the very essence of World Building but the lifeblood at times is missing – the Figures!

We were also recently given Vedain who pilots the prisoner Skiff and was welcomed with thunderous applause.

But there’s a glaring omission currently from the prisoner Skiff. Only one character is missing to complete the scene and that’s the one the only VELKEN TEZERI.

It would be remiss if I failed to mention that Hasbro can utilize Velken’s tooling to make the last Rancor Keeper – Weeba Weeba that we need a figure of and the goon that Luke force stole his blaster – Nizuc Bek. That’s 3 figures from one set of tooling!!!

Please sign this petition and vote for Velken to be made. Your wildest dreams may not come true but at the very least it’s data to provide Hasbro that there’s a community of collectors out there that desperately want him made.

Please Hasbro We beg you!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN5ZnkuY29tL3N5Znktd2lyZS9oYXNicm8tcGx1cy1mYW4tZmVzdC1wb3dlci1yYW5nZXJzLWRpbm8tZnVyeS1zbmFrZS1leWVzLXN0YXItd2Fyc9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN5ZnkuY29tL3N5Znktd2lyZS9oYXNicm8tcGx1cy1mYW4tZmVzdC1wb3dlci1yYW5nZXJzLWRpbm8tZnVyeS1zbmFrZS1leWVzLXN0YXItd2Fycz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hasbro Pulse Fan Fest: Power Rangers Dino Fury gets a Gold Ranger and Snake Eyes action figure teases upcoming movie,"The Power Rangers roster is expanding again. As revealed Friday during the Hasbro Pulse Fan Fest Power Rangers Dino Fury is adding a sixth team member later this season. Following months of speculation the cast introduced newcomer Jordan Fite who will play Aiyon aka the Gold Ranger in the newest incarnation of the venerable franchise.

In Dino Fury which premiered in February on Nickelodeon as the 28th (!) season of the Power Rangers series the rangers draw their powers from ancient dinosaurs in their bid to protect Earth from alien invaders. No details were revealed about Aiyon’s backstory but Fite did tell CNET that “he doesn't like to play by the rules.” (Though it was a toy-related event no action figures based on the Gold Ranger were unveiled.)

The Power Rangers were one of several properties featured in the collector-focused Hasbro Pulse event which was hosted by SYFY Wire contributor Jackie Jennings. Among the new product reveals was a Star Wars x-wing fighter and action figure set of the Rogue One pilot Antoc Merrick. This is the Rebel Alliance Blue Squadron leader’s first appearance in action figure form. The Mandalorian characters Koska Reeves and Q9-0 are set to make their toy debuts as well.

During the G.I. Joe portion of the program fans were given what was essentially the first look at the upcoming live-action spinoff movie Snake Eyes. Henry Golding who plays the title character popped in for an enthusiastic unboxing of the action figure for his alter ego. Since Paramount has yet to release a trailer for the film this was the clearest look yet at the formidable ninja's film debut.

Though details are still scarce Golding pointed to one of action figure's accessories a gold sword called Morning Light and teased that ""the story behind that will be told in the movie."" He also called attention to the signature Arashikage clan logo on the figure’s arm. The character debuted back in 1982 as part of the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero action figure and comic book line and subsequent animated series. (Golding’s 6-inch figure part of Hasbro's G.I. Joe Classified Series line is scheduled to be released in October and is available for pre-order now for $22.99.)

Other character figures were also debuted including Storm Shadow (played by Andrew Koji) the main rival of Snake Eyes and Akiko a new character to the G.I. Joe universe played by Haruka Abe.

Snake Eyes which was originally set for an October 2020 release had been rescheduled for October 2021 due to the pandemic but during the panel it was announced that it wil now open three months earlier on July 23 exclusively in theaters.

Its latest PIAA championship trophy to be exact.

The Trojans for the third time in five years won the state title in the meet’s coed varsity division.

Their routine performed Saturday at Hershey’s Giant Center warranted an average of 89.47 points from a three-judge panel. Butler at 81.92 was second among nine squads.

Saturday's result was overwhelming to Deena Pribonic for two reasons.

Pribonic assumed head coaching duties this season after she formerly served as an assistant. She was aware of the pressure that came with the position based on McDowell's recent history.

The Trojans claimed consecutive PIAA coed championships in 2017-18 and were second in 2019.

McDowell also was required by school officials to practice and perform with masks on because of COVID-19.

That was required throughout the entire season not just at states.

""They worked so hard in a year that has come with so many ups and downs"" Pribonic said. ""They stayed positive and did what they needed to do to stay healthy. I'm so proud of them.""

McDowell waited longer than normal to collect its latest state title.

The District 10 and PIAA competitive spirit meets normally take place over January and February. However this season’s competitions were delayed until March and April because of the pandemic.

PIAA precautions didn’t end there.

Although McDowell was one of four division champions during March’s district meet at the Joann Mullen Gymnasium only the Trojans and Warren moved on because the PIAA sought to limit the number of squads that traveled to Hershey.

Also each squad only performed once Saturday instead of needing to reach the finals through preliminary and semifinal rounds.

""The nerves were high but we tried to stay calm cool and humbled"" Pribonic said. ""We tried to do what we do best.""

Warren was one of eight schools in the Class 2A large varsity division.

The Dragons finished sixth with an average of 67.07. Bishop McCort won at 84.02.

Lansdale Catholic (2A small varsity) South Fayette (Class 3A small varsity) and St. Hubert’s Catholic (3A large varsity) were Saturday’s other PIAA champions.

We know hockey fights are kind of going out of style but there’s something about a good old fashioned Sunday afternoon tilt that still does it for us especially when they’re as electric as this one.

The Hersey Bears took on the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins yesterday afternoon in AHL action and the Bears managed to squeak out of the tightly-fought battle with a 2-0 win. The game itself wasn’t the only hard-fought battle on the ice yesterday and midway through the second Bears’ tough guy Kale Kessy dropped the mitts with the Penguins’ Kyle Olson after he laid a big hit on a teammate and the fight was great.

The best part though? The way that Kessy took perfectly cocky skate past the Scranton bench after taking care of business.

News Americas WASHINGTON D.C. Mon. April 12 2021: In the first article in this four-part series I focused on Venezuela’s recent saber-rattling moves. In this 2nd part I turn attention now to stakes involved for the two South American nations.

The spotlight on Guyana as the world’s newest petro-power-in-the-making Venezuela’s recent military moves related to its claim for the Essequibo territory and the battle before the World Court over the territory provoke curiosity about the stakes involved for the two countries.

The stakes are high for both countries. For Guyana retaining the disputed Essequibo territory which gets its name after the river is a life-or-death matter. One gets a sense of its existential nature for the Guyanese when it’s recognized that Venezuela claims all the territory west of the Essequibo River which begins near the border with Brazil and runs 600 miles north to the Atlantic Ocean. The majestic Essequibo River on which I’ve had the pleasure to travel on several occasions is South America’s third largest river after the Amazon and the Orinoco. Its estuary alone is 20 miles wide.

The Essequibo Territory

The Essequibo comprises 61600 sq miles of Guyana’s 83000 sq mi almost 75 percent of the country. It’s more than five-and-a-half times the size of Massachusetts. It could accommodate Jamaica fourteen-and-a-half times and Costa Rica three times. The territory holds six of Guyana’s 10 administrative regions the equivalent of states or provinces in other countries and some 300000 of the country’s estimated population of just under 800000 with a noteworthy amount of them being from various Indigenous groups. Guyana has nine distinct Indigenous peoples.

The dispute itself dates to 1841 when Venezuela protested alleged British encroachment on its territory. In 1814 Great Britain had acquired then British Guiana by treaty with Netherlands. Because the treaty didn’t define the western boundary the British commissioned German surveyor and naturalist Robert Schomburgk to delineate the boundary. Schomburg’s 1835 survey resulted in what came to be known as “the Schomburgk Line.” Venezuela disputed Schomburgk’s demarcation claiming territorial delineations established at the time of their independence from Spain in 1810. They claimed their borders extended east to the Essequibo River.

The gold discovered in 1850s in the disputed area led Britain to seek to further extend its reach claiming an additional 33000 square miles west of the Schomburgk Line. Venezuela protested in 1876 broke diplomatic relations with Britain and appealed to the United States for assistance citing the 1823 Monroe Doctrine as justification for U.S. involvement. The United States even threatened war with Britain. With Washington’s encouragement in 1897 Britain and Venezuela signed the Washington Treaty that took the matter to arbitration. The treaty contained a key provision: that the parties would consider the outcome of the arbitration “as a full perfect and final settlement of all the questions referred to the Arbitrators.”

The arbitration resulted in the October 1899 Paris Arbitral Award which gave Venezuela the mouth of Orinoco River and a 5000 square mile extension around Point Barima and it gave Britain the land to the east extending to the Essequibo River. Decades later in 1944 Severo Mallet-Prevost one of the Venezuelan lawyers at the arbitration penned a letter which he asked to be opened only at his death. The letter which was published in 1949 alleged collusion between the Russian president of the tribunal and the British members which disadvantaged Venezuela. Even so Venezuela accepted the 1899 agreement until 1962. As Guyana’s independence talks progressed they informed the United Nations in February of that year that they considered a dispute to exist with Britain regarding the border with the soon-to-be-independent Guyana.

Oil And Other Resource Abundance

The Essequibo holds considerable wealth including oil gold diamond bauxite manganese uranium and other minerals and timber. As well it’s part of the Guiana Shield which extends across the Guainía department of Colombia; Venezuela where the Orinoco river makes the northern limit of the Shield; Guyana; Suriname; and French Guiana. Thus the Essequibo has an abundance of biodiversity riches.

The massive oil discoveries since May 2015 raised the stakes to a new high for Guyana which is now set to become among the world’s largest crude oil producers with offshore deposits estimated at 8 billion barrels. Coincidentally Venezuela began experiencing a meltdown in its oil industry around the same time. The Stabroek Block in Guyana located approximately 120 miles offshore is 6.6 million acres. While ExxonMobil takes the spotlight in relation to the discovery the project involves a consortium that includes Hess Corporation and a unit of China’s National Offshore Oil Corporation.

The Hess Corporation is so confident about profitability in Guyana that on March 18 2021 Yahoo!finance announced its sale of $150 million of its Danish assets intending to use the proceeds “to fund our world class investment opportunity in Guyana.” Earlier the same month on March 3 2021 ExxonMobil Senior Vice President of Upstream Neil Chapman told investors that the company’s acreage in the Guyana-Suriname basin is the largest of all the international oil companies. Meanwhile companies from Britain Canada France Israel and Spain also are pursuing Guyana’s Black Gold bounty.

Gains for Venezuela

Venezuela calls the area Guayana Esequiba or zona en reclamación. Writing in the February 21st edition of the Caracas Chronicles analyst Reybert Carrillo explains the sizeable economic strategic and other gains Venezuela would acquire with possession of the disputed territory. For instance it would obtain an extensive hydrographic network that includes the Essequibo River and its Atlantic delta the Cuyuni Rupununi Mazaruni and Supenaam rivers as well as the Potaro River and its 741 ft Kaieteur Falls which has the world’s largest single drop waterfall by the volume of water flowing over it.

Crucially too with almost 300 km of new coastland and over 40 km of ocean waters the benefits would include customs taxes fishing and security plus all the minerals in the Essequibo mentioned earlier. Indeed the oil extraction and reserves in Guyana must have Venezuelans practically salivating with some analysts speculating about the country’s willingness to step up its aggression. Writing in the January 25 2021 edition of Oilprice.com Viktor Katona posed the provocative question: Will Venezuela go to war over oil? My own sense is that although Venezuela outmatches Guyana militarily by a factor of more than 35 to one wisdom will prevail in foregoing the military option; they will realize that the geopolitical and economic losses stand to far outweigh any military occupation gains.

So Venezuela is anxious about reclaiming what it considers its stolen patrimony. Guyana now in its 55th year of independence from Britain and on the cusp of moving into the economic stratosphere because of the abundant supply of its Black Gold is experiencing existential anxiety although they never considered the territory to be in dispute.

The stakes are high not just for the Guyanese leaders and people though. The corporate executives and investors of ExxonMobil Hess Anadarko CGX Energy Ratio Oil Repsol Tullow and China’s National Offshore Oil Corporation must surely be anxious to avoid conflict that could disrupt their valued petro-pursuits. I have every reason to believe they will not rely just on hope but will act appropriately to aid a peaceful resolution of the dispute.

Simply sign up to the Retail & Consumer industry myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

At the Hilton it’s all about “Travel with Purpose”. At the InterContinental it’s a “Journey to Tomorrow”. At the Marriott they “Serve 360”. These days all the world’s largest hotel chains have a corporate responsibility slogan — and a programme — complete with environmental targets.

As an industry hotels account for about 1 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions according to a 2018 UN World Tourism Organisation report. So with pressure mounting to address climate change the businesses have needed ways to bring these down.

In the past year closures forced by the coronavirus pandemic have made it easier for them to achieve this. But as global economies start to reopen the chains now face a double difficulty: meeting ambitious green targets while securing a post-pandemic recovery.

“There’s this challenge for us at the moment . . . short term versus long term” says Catherine Dolton vice-president of global corporate responsibility at InterContinental Hotels Group.

Radisson: ‘green’ financing is one way to meet targets © Artyom Geodakyan/TASS/Getty Images

In 2017 the International Tourism Partnership (now the Sustainable Hospitality Alliance) laid out targets for hotels aligned to the Paris inter-governmental climate agreement: a 66 per cent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions per room by 2030 and 90 per cent by 2050 compared with a 2010 baseline.

Between 2018 and 2019 Willy Legrand a professor of hospitality management at IUBH business school analysed the nine largest international hotel chains (by number of properties) and found that only one — Accor — had adopted targets in line with the SHA’s recommendations.

In addition hotel groups’ sustainability strategies remain hard to compare because they often use different base years target years and units of measurement.

15% Marriott’s target for reducing its carbon footprint from 2016 to 2025

For example Wyndham Hotels’ latest target commits the group to reducing emissions by 15 per cent by 2025 from a baseline of 2019. “It’s difficult to judge whether this is on track to a 90 per cent reduction by 2050” says Prof Legrand. Wyndham declined to comment.

Hilton group has pledged to reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions from sites it owns or manages (not including its franchised hotels) by 61 per cent per square metre by 2030 from a 2008 base year. But Marriott has committed to reducing its carbon footprint across its portfolio by 30 per cent by 2025 from a 2016 baseline.

Meanwhile IHG’s 2030 target is a 15 per cent reduction of emissions in its managed hotels and a 46 per cent reduction per square metre in franchised hotels from a 2018 base year.

While data gathering on carbon emissions is now standard practice assessing other elements of hotels’ sustainability goals — such as water usage — can be more complex. Measuring the impact of water usage for example depends on local conditions.

Sustainability criteria such as switching to refillable toiletry bottles are embedded in franchise standards. Numerical targets for carbon emissions are not

The Sustainable Hospitality Alliance’s goal on water pledges “increased water-use efficiency” but does not include a numerical target. It says this is because “water issues such as scarcity pollution and community access to clean water are intrinsically linked to their local context”.

A hotel using large volumes of water in a water-rich area has less impact than a hotel using average volumes in a dry area.

“It is very tough to make measurable progress there” says Kate Mikesell vice-president of corporate responsibility at Hilton. “There are just so many different systems that we would have to take into account.” She refers to measures such as where water comes from conflicts with community usage and infrastructure for treatment.

Hilton has a target to reduce water in its managed operations by 50 per cent from a 2008 baseline but like IHG and others it does not have a group-wide target that encompasses franchises. Dolton says: “Our data isn’t that great today so we don’t want to set a hard target when we know we don’t have a good baseline.”

Another difficulty lies in the chains’ franchise models. “We can’t really tell the franchises how to operate their hotels” says Denise Naguib vice-president of sustainability at Marriott. While some sustainability criteria such as the elimination of styrofoam and switching from mini toiletries to large refillable bottles are embedded in franchise standards numerical targets for carbon emissions are not.

Refillable bottles for toiletries are one way to make a difference

Instead Marriott requires hotel owners to use its environmental reporting platform called Mesh. They must supply quantitative and qualitative sustainability data which provides Marriott with group-wide baseline information. Marriott says it then uses that data to give guidance — not requirements — to its franchisees. “There is no penalty if they don’t meet them but we’re recommending goals” Naguib says.

A business case for sustainability improvements for everything from low-consumption shower heads and LED lights to water-recycling systems can be a stronger incentive Dolton argues. “Clearly the way to do this is to speak from a business perspective how these things will save costs” she says.

Because of the pandemic Dolton admits it has “definitely become much harder” to suggest environmental improvements that will save money in the long run but require large upfront investment. “In the next couple of years it's going to be difficult to achieve significant carbon reductions purely because our owners aren't going to be investing a lot in solutions” she says. “But it's all about taking that journey towards [IHG’s 2030] targets.”

Still she notes franchise holders “are extremely receptive to things that might save them costs” such as energy efficient lightbulbs.

What if hotels miss their targets? According to Prof Legrand: “There isn’t a consequence except a PR consequence . . . unless we have a proper carbon market and we say: ‘OK this is a target and whatever you emit above it is going to cost you.’”

Dolton says there is increased investor interest in financial accountability — for example by tying the remuneration of senior executives to sustainability targets via long-term incentive plans. However she says these are just discussions so far.

‘Short term versus long term challenge’: Catherine Dolton IHG

Green financing could also have a part to play says Inge Huijbrechts senior vice-president of sustainability at Radisson Hotel Group.

In 2019 Edwardian Hotels one of Radisson’s franchise partners borrowed £175m from HSBC to finance redevelopment of The Londoner hotel in Leicester Square. A condition of the loan was that the building had to achieve an “excellent” rating under the BREEAM energy standard a benchmarking system used across the UK. This requires the use of low-carbon construction materials and high levels of energy efficiency in operation. The loan was the first of its kind in the hotel sector.

“It seems like [green financing] hasn't really reached its full potential in the hotel industry and that’s certainly something that's worth exploring more” says Huijbrechts.

“What matters most now is the path toward full decarbonisation” reckons Prof Legrand. This is a journey that he says must be followed closely. “There is an argument to be made for hotels’ targets [for decarbonisation by 2050] to be third-party verified so that transparency is available across the board.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZmx5ZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMTAvbmV3LXRvLWhvdGVsLWNoYWluLWVsaXRlLXN0YXR1cy1oZXJlcy1hbi1lYXN5LXdheS10by1uZWFybHktdHdvLXllYXJzLW9mLXBlcmtzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New to Hotel Chain Elite Status? Here's An Easy Way to Nearly Two Years of Perks,"A pandemic might not seem like the obvious moment to start thinking about elite status with a hotel chain. But many of us travel hackers started out in exactly the same place… Hilton Honors and its MVP Fast Track program.

The MVP Fast Track program requires you to:

Register your Hilton Honors account details

Complete 4 separate stays within 90 days of registration

In order to sign up you are supposed to be: an athletic administrator athlete or affiliated with a sports entity sports related company sports group. However you won’t be asked for any proof but even something as simple as a gym membership would qualify.

You might assume that you must pay for your 4 stays but you’d be wrong… Award stays also count.

Even though Inside Flyer’s Tom likes to write about how you can buy Hilton points to use them on super-cheap award nights nowhere near you or anywhere you’d like to visit I’d suggest that you simply book paid or award stays in places you are already interested in visiting. The important point to note is that a “stay” is defined as consecutive nights at the same hotel irrespective of the number of times you check in and out or how many separate reservations you’ve made..

What Does Hilton Gold Status Get Me?

There’s no point pretending that you are going to see very many room upgrades when travelling in the United States. But when you head overseas you can often be upgraded to much nicer rooms.

Otherwise Hilton Honors hotels tend to deliver what is promised – complimentary breakfast and bonus points – with no confusing brand opt-outs…

You also benefit from Hilton’s “fifth night free” award pricing. Only available to members with status your fifth night is free when using points to book award stays.

Because you would be qualifying for Gold status in mid-2021 your new status would be valid for the rest of 2021 ALL of 2022 and the first three months of 2023. That’s nearly two years of free breakfast and bonus points…

Beyond Hilton

I mentioned in the opening paragraph how travel hackers often “start” with Hilton Gold via this MVP Fast Track. That is because Hilton Gold status is very solid – and therefore other hotel chains are happy to accept it when considering whether to offer you a status match / challenge. So even if the COVID pandemic keeps you from travelling much more than the 4 initial stays you might come across a status match opportunity in late 2022 / early 2023 that would allow you to leverage this Gold status into something even better…

Because your 90 days start counting from the moment of registration you should delay signing up until a couple of days before your next Hilton Honors stay…",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3BldHMtcGxheS1pbXBvcnRhbnQtcm9sZS1pbi1lYXNpbmctY2hpbGRyZW5zLWxvbmVsaW5lc3MtYW5kLXN0cmVzcy1pbnRlbnNpZmllZC1ieS12aXJ0dWFsLXNjaG9vbGluZy1pbi1sb2NrZG93bi0zMDEyNjYxODcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pets play important role in easing children's loneliness and stress intensified by virtual schooling in lockdown,"BRUSSELS April 10 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- A new survey conducted by Mars Petcare of 2000 parents across the UK and US shows family pets help children better manage feelings of stress and loneliness which have been greatly exacerbated by virtual schooling as a result of the pandemic[1].

Around the world 332 million children have lived under stay-at-home policies for at least nine months[2] and nearly 1.6 billion learners have been affected by disruption of in-person schooling[3]. There are early indicators that the pandemic has had a negative impact on children's social skills productivity and well-being. Save the Children report that more than half of children who were separated from friends during the pandemic reported feeling less happy and more worried[4] and this shift to virtual schooling means students may have more distractions and less oversight which can reduce their motivation[5].

For many families navigating the stress and challenges of home-schooling pets have offered children crucial support. More than eight in 10 (83%) parents found that their family pet helped their child feel less lonely during lockdown with more than three-quarters feeling that day-to-day interactions with their cat or dog reduced their child's stress and anxiety. Parents agreed their pet supported their child during the unprecedented break from in-person schooling by improving their mood providing companionship and giving much-needed emotional support.

Pets may make the best study buddy

The survey also found that pets positively impacted a child's experience of virtual learning and academic performance across all ages – with nine in 10 parents seeing improvements in their child's emotional social and core skill development including having more energy and improved concentration providing a fun topic of conversation to engage with their classmates and teacher and giving them a much-needed break away from the screen. More than half (56%) report having a pet helped improve their child's academic performance and 72% say their child is more motivated with a pet around[1].

""There are proven benefits to having pets in the classroom when it comes to improving children's confidence focus and reducing their stress but this survey shows that pets also played an important part in helping children emotionally as they come to terms with this unprecedented time away from their peers"" said Mary Margaret Callahan Chief Mission Officer of the leading therapy animal organisation Pet Partners. ""We've been absolutely overwhelmed with the response from teachers parents and students to our teams' virtual therapy animal visits during the pandemic. There is now an important role for animals in helping children adjust as they return to school.""

More time together benefits wellbeing of children and pets

Equally the survey revealed this increased bond between children and their pets has many benefits for the pet too. The results found 40% of children spent more than two hours of time with their pet each day during the pandemic (compared to just 21% before the pandemic) and the majority of parents (77%) believe their pet is also calmer now that they spend more time with their child.

""Talking or reading to a pet has been shown to help children to build confidence and connect with both peers and teachers. Exploring the important role human-animal interaction can play in a range of settings – from the classroom and office to the hospital or simply at home – is something we at Mars Petcare have been committed to for many years"" said Kay O'Donnell Vice President Waltham Petcare Science Institute the fundamental science centre for Mars Petcare. ""It is wonderful to see these survey results reinforce how pets may help address the growing burden of loneliness and social isolation which we know can be as detrimental to health as obesity as well as indications pets have benefited from this additional time together.""

""The pandemic was an abrupt change for my students and for education in general and all educators were challenged to find new and creative ways to engage our classes"" said Chris Koenig Health and Physical Education Teacher in Oregon's Gresham-Barlow School District. ""Adding Bella to my lesson plans for Pet Fridays has gone a long way in giving my students – and our dog – something positive to look forward to.""

Majority of parents want pet interaction in traditional classrooms as a result

The survey also revealed that the majority (80%) of parents believe pet interaction should be used in schools as students begin to transition back to traditional classrooms and restrictions ease. Seventy-five percent of parents believed schools should invest more to bring controlled pet interaction into the traditional classroom setting.

Parents and teachers like Chris around the world have shared touching anecdotes relaying their personal experiences of having pets in the home classroom during the pandemic and how pets make it better.

As I’m cruising through Home Depot this weekend looking for a new exterior door for my condo I wondered about an organization that has evolved from the big box retailer I knew as a kid in Lakeland FL. My high school friends would work there during the summer and I always thought it was an overwhelming place.

I’ve noticed… More and more I was able to skip visiting the massive warehouses of Home Depot’s retail locations and hire pros to install my home projects using apps and their website. My entire exterior door project was booked using their website the call center and a measurement in-store. How did they become so good at creating a seamless experience across their different touchpoints?

The Answer: Digital Transformation.

Digital transformation is “fusing together the physical biological chemical and information worlds.” It’s considered the 4th Industrial Revolution by Tony Saldanha author of “Why Digital Transformations Fail” a highly successful text on the best practices of digital transformations.

Saldanha mentions that the “retail apocalypse” or the fact that many retailers who have primarily relied on bricks and mortar sales are filing for bankruptcy is a symptom that the 4th revolution is affecting businesses today. (Saldanha 2019)

In this blog I will introduce an example from Home Depot a major U.S. home improvement retailer and describe their in-progress digital transformation and its signs of success.

What makes digital transformation successful?

Successful digital transformation means enabling your business to create perpetual movement. It means you’re evolving to meet customers where they are when they need your products/services and delivering the value they are looking for in the most efficient ways. This means you’ve embraced technology enabled all parts of the organization to leverage this technology and created processes that allow you to adapt business models at the speed of your customers and potential customers.

In his second chapter Saldanha describes a successful transformation as the culmination of five stages of development along a continuum. His fifth stage “Living DNA” is described as an organization that is in constant motion. They have employees that are digitally savvy their systems are interconnected they’ve adopted the most innovative business models and will continue to do so as they are testing learning and adapting with lean agility. (Saldanha 2019) This idea describes successful digital transformation.

The Business Problem at Home Depot

Home Depot is a U.S. based retailer that was founded to serve the “do-it-yourselfer” with massive warehouse stores that dwarf local hardware stores with superior selection helpful staff and quality products in a one-stop-shop. (The Home Depot 2021)

The model was highly successful but over time new types of customers have emerged slowing their ability to grow. In 2016 Kevin Hoffman the president of ecommerce at Home Depot described the emerging “do-it-for-me” consumer that was looking for full-service installation quality products and less hands-on home improvement experience. Providing this customer with the experience they wanted required Home Depot to address legacy technologies and embrace ecommerce and digital properties at the start of the shopping experience. (Lauchlan 2015)

The Solution: One Home Depot

In 2018 Home Depot unveiled their plan to transform their retail experience to focus on a digital single interconnected experience across their ecommerce platforms and in-store. This system was introduced to provide consumers with a “frictionless interconnected shopping experience.” (The Home Depot 2019)

The idea of a frictionless shopping experience that attempts to connect different platforms and business models meets the requirements outlined by Saldanha of what it means to do digital transformation. In Home Depot’s case it was translating the in-store shopping experience and the helpfulness of its staff to ecommerce and digital experiences. The transformation needed to reflect the brand in digital and make sure suppliers/stores were able to deliver on services purchased in these new channels.

Key Systems Addressed Technologies Used

To begin their transformation the CEO of Home Depot unveiled One Home Depot a major initiative to create an interconnected experience. This support from senior leadership with goals and progress discussed in quarterly conference calls set the tone for the rest of the organization. Change needed to happen and leadership was invested. (Bonde et all 2019)

To enable transformation the organization made investments in their IT developer data and analytics capabilities. In 2018 they hired approximately 1000 technology professionals in technology hubs located throughout the U.S. This transformed the company’s capabilities allowing them to develop new mobile and ecommerce customer experiences specially built for the new “do-it-for-me” segment. (The Home Depot 2018)

Home Depot also updated its capabilities in continuous integration and ideas from agile software development. The “OrangeMethod” was the company’s way to educate employees in new ways of thinking and moving beyond their core competencies to make the digital transformation happen at their organization. It also set the process that enabled the new technology hires to build One Home Depot. (Home Depot Careers 2018)

Impact to Home Depot

As a result of their proactive digital transformation the company was well prepared for the impact of Covid-19. Despite store closings the retailer had tremendous success in capitalizing on consumer trends that benefited home improvement retailers. According to their 2020 annual report digital sales grew 86% versus the year prior their digital properties had record traffic throughout the year and overall sales increased 20%. (The Home Depot 2020)

As the CEO states “Retailers that create a seamless interconnected experience blending the physical and digital worlds will be positioned well in the marketplace.” He credits his organizations 2020 success to the investments made to digital transformation as realized in their One Home Depot vision.

Having lost the lease for his Main Avenue shop just prior to the COVID-19 pandemic owner Alfredo Moreno had to start over.

For the past year he has been preparing for a new store at the Passaic Plaza strip mall on Dayton Avenue across the street from Home Depot.

It was a challenge but Moreno is no stranger to starting over.

In 1994 he paddled his way from Cuba with his brother to seek a new life in the United States.

""I just wanted to come here and work hard"" he said.

They tied together two truck-tire inner tubes and paddled the 90 miles to Florida like thousands of other ""balseros"" or rafters fleeing Cuba under the Castro regime.

Until 2017 Cubans who arrived this way could pursue legal U.S. residency.

Moreno made his way to New Jersey and began working at Newark Airport running baggage and saving his money.

In 2001 he purchased a Dairy Queen that had been around for some 30 years and made it his own.

Local:Wendy's coming to Passaic as part of downtown redevelopment plan

""I get dads who say they were brought here by their dads and say 'Now I got a son of my own"" Moreno said.

In 2020 when it became apparent the property's owner wasn't going to renew the lease Moreno decided to move to the Dayton Avenue strip mall after contacting the city.

A selling point is that the Dayton Avenue site is just up the block from a new school expected to open within the next year and hold 3000 students.

Mayor Hector Lora said of Moreno ""It is a tale of resiliency of entrepreneurship of motivation and enthusiasm"" and one he has seen over and over again among his city's residents.

Minutes after the ribbon-cutting Friday ice cream lovers were waiting outside.

Moreno was aided by Lora who held a Facebook Live at the ribbon-cutting and promised any kid who could guess Passaic's favorite flavor a free ice cream.

Moreno said Lora donated $1000 to buy ice cream for any kid that came through the door.

They didn't even have to know that at the Passaic Dairy Queen the favorite flavor is rum raisin.

He passed away doing what he loved most spending time with his wife outdoors and riding his ATV.

Jesse was stubborn from the very beginning and finally made his grand entrance on his own time and with his own style on May 19 1977 in Provo Utah to Alan and Brenda Heiner. He grew up in Roy Utah and loved to be outside every chance he could possibly get. He loved to build anything his very creative mind could imagine; including race track for bikes sledding hills mud swimming holes huts and treehouses (without a tree to put it in.)

Jesse attended Country View and Midland Elementary Roy Jr. High and Washington High. Jesse quickly learned being stuck in a classroom indoors wasn't for him and he preferred his education to be hands on and outdoors.

Jesse loved working with his hands and started working on construction at 16 years old. Jesse quickly learned how to do everything at his new job but his preference and specialties were framing decks and stairs. Jesse built many homes including ones for his family from the ground up. Jesse also helped build several churches and commercial buildings including the Comfort Inn on 21st Street in Ogden and several of the Snowbasin Lodges.

Jesse loved his mom and dad more than words could possibly describe. He also had a great love and respect for his siblings. Anytime he was out of town he would write to them and tell them how much he missed them. Jesse loved to cook and throw parties to have his family near him.

Jesse was always looking for a new adventure and loved to go four wheeling biking fishing hiking rafting skateboarding and going to his property. Jesse was always accompanied with his fur best friend of 17 years Tigger. He felt inspired by music and loved to play it loud enough to feel it. Jesse was always there to help anyone and made many lifelong friends because of his friendly and helpful personality.

Jesse met and married Dayna Greene in July of 2000. They were later divorced.

Jesse loved his job at Home Depot. He loved being around tools flowers and great deals. During his three years he was there he earned several awards for his dedication to the job. He also won one of his prized possessions his Traeger Smoker for being safe on the job. While working Jesse met his Soulmate and very best friend Vickie Sherrow in 2016. In 2018 they started dating and were instantly smitten with one another. They were later married October 20 2018 and were inseparable. Jesse and Vickie shared a true one of a kind love that will go on ""Always and Forever"".

Jesse lived for his children and enjoyed spending all the time he could with them. Jesse loved to play games like chess monopoly and puzzles with his kids. Jesse also loved to go on trips with his children some of his favorite being Dallas with his daughter Alie; Boise with daughters Kirstie and Taylor; and Wendover with his son Kenny. Jesse loved each of his five children with all of his heart and would do anything for them.

Jesse is survived by his loving wife and other half Victoria Heiner his parents Alan and Brenda Heiner his children Natausha Greene Kenny Callaghan-Heiner Kirstie Sherrow and Taylor Sherrow his siblings Annastacie (Raymond) Orozco Michael (Kassie) Heiner Christopher (Ashley) Heiner his grandchildren Braxton Kailynn and Ayla Apple and finally his fur baby Little Princess Olie.

Jesse was preceded in death by his beautiful daughter Alie Cheri Greene his sister Sarah Elizabeth Heiner his grandparents Conard Heiner Verna Bingham Heiner Derrel Robert Johnstun and Betty Rae Hamaker Johnstun and finally his ""Furever Friend"" and best girl Tigger.

Funeral services will be held at 11 a.m. on Monday April 19 2021 at the Roy 26th Ward 3649 West 4800 South. The family will meet with friends from 9:30 -10:30 a.m. at the church.

PETERSBURG — The amount of excitement throughout Rays camp was staggering when Brent Honeywell started a March 22 exhibition.

That was the first and only game action for the one-time top prospect since Sept. 19 2017 at Triple A. He injured his elbow the next spring had Tommy John surgery and remained sidelined after undergoing three subsequent procedures.

Sunday Honeywell will make his major-league debut.

The 26-year-old right-hander was called up to replace the injured Chris Archer and will serve as the opener working an inning or maybe a little more against the Yankees at Tropicana Field.

The Rays will need to make more moves to fill Archer’s spot in the rotation which comes up next on Thursday and boost a bullpen that covered 6⅔ innings Saturday; Josh Fleming and Trevor Richards are the most likely candidates. But Honeywell is lined up to for Sunday and the limited role pitching in front of Michael Wacha is a good fit as he builds up his workload.

When Honeywell worked his inning against the Red Sox in March he said getting the chance to pitch in a game gave him the “chill bumps” he’d been missing and there was “no doubt” he’d make it to the majors sometime this season.

“I feel like I could’ve pitched in the big leagues last year towards the end” he said.

And now Sunday as the Rays will say around the clubhouse is “Honey Day.”

A new spin

Willy Adames and Randy Arozarena are two of the most expressive Rays and they showed that again Saturday. As Arozarena returned to the dugout after homering in the third a 420-foot blast to center he and Adames faced off like they were DJs at a club. Pretty much. “There’s a song a Dominican artist (O Mandrake) he’s pretty much talking about the coronavirus” Arozarena said via team interpreter Manny Navarro. “We learned a couple verses from the song so when we celebrate we rap it to each other.”

Yankee doodles

In assuring a fifth straight series win over the Yankees the Rays improved to 12-2 in their 14 meetings with a plus-27 run differential (15-4 if you count the AL Division Series). … The Rays shut out the Yankees at the Trop for the third time since July 2018; that hasn’t happened to the Bronx Bombers at any other road park in that span (and only three times at home). … Rightfielder Aaron Judge (sore left side) and third baseman Gio Urshela (reaction to vaccination) returned to the Yankees’ lineup. Saturday starter Domingo German was optioned to the minors after the game.

(Courtesy: iStock/Devrimb)

A quantum charged coupled device – a type of trapped-ion quantum computer first proposed 20 years ago – has finally been fully realized by researchers at Honeywell in the US. Other researchers in the field believe the design which offers notable advantages over other quantum computing platforms could potentially enable quantum computers to scale to huge numbers of quantum bits (qubits) and fully realize their potential.

Trapped-ion qubits were used to implement the first quantum logic gates in 1995 and the proposal for a quantum charged coupled device (QCCD) – a type of quantum computer with actions controlled by shuffling the ions around – was first made in 2002 by researchers led by David Wineland of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology who went on to win the 2012 Nobel Prize for Physics for his work.

Quantum gates have subsequently been demonstrated in multiple platforms from Rydberg atoms to defects in diamond. The quantum computing technology first used by IT giants however was solid state qubits. In these the qubits are superconducting circuits which can be mounted directly on to a chip. These rapidly surpassed the benchmarks set by trapped ions and are used in record-breaking machines from IBM and Google: “Working with trapped ions I would be asked by people ‘Why aren’t you working with superconducting qubits? Isn’t that race pretty much already settled?’” says Winfried Hensinger of the UK’s University of Sussex.

Progress is slowing

Recently however the progress made using superconducting circuits appears to be slowing as quantum computers integrate more and more qubits. To interact properly the qubits must be identical and whereas two copies of the same ion are guaranteed by quantum mechanics to be indistinguishable fabricating identical circuits is near-impossible. Fabrication directly onto a chip also places superconducting circuits in thermal equilibrium with the chip: “If you build a superconducting qubit-based quantum computer you have to cool that machine all the way to millikelvin temperatures” says Hensinger. “That works fine if you have 10 100…maybe 1000 qubits but it’s going to be really challenging when you go to really large numbers.”

Some large companies have recently shown interest in the trapped ion platform among them the multinational technology conglomerate Honeywell which formed Honeywell Quantum Systems in 2020 to focus solely on the technology.

The firm’s latest result unveiled in Nature is the first demonstration of a fully functional QCCD. The device uses ytterbium-171 ions as qubits which are chilled to their quantum ground states by barium-138 ions using a process called sympathetic cooling. The setup is contained in a linear trap above a chip cooled to around 10 K in a vacuum chamber. Ions held within the trap are shuffled between positions by dynamic electric fields while quantum logical operations on the ions are performed by laser beams.

Teleported CNOT gate

The researchers demonstrate a sufficient set of gates to perform universal quantum logic. In addition they created a teleported CNOT gate which allows for non-destructive mid-circuit measurement – a crucial component for quantum error correction.

Their device has only six qubits compared to 53 superconducting qubits in Google’s Sycamore – the machine with which Google claimed quantum advantage in 2019. However Honeywell’s computer is arguably more powerful because of the flexibility of the QCCD architecture: “These ions are fully connected” explains team member David Hayes; “With superconducting qubits or things like them you can’t have a qubit over here talk to a qubit over there if there’s a whole bunch of qubits in the way – you have to move that information through there and there’s a whole bunch of errors that will accumulate along the way.”

Hensinger is impressed with the Honeywell device: “This is really a phase change now we have a complete machine built on a shuttling-based approach” he says; “It has been demonstrated with all the key ingredients. People often ask me when we can have a million-qubit machine: obviously there are still many many challenges to be overcome but I think this [research] demonstrates that it is a straight engineering path.”

Chris Monroe of University of Maryland College Park a co-author of Wineland’s on the original 2002 paper who now runs the spin-off company IonQ agrees: “In this field every single little piece has been demonstrated separately. One of the important features of this work is that it integrated lots of them in one system. I love the QCCD idea: I actually coined that phrase myself.” He cautions however that “the QCCD works great with six or eight ions but when you get to 80 200 or 300 ions to enjoy that full connectivity you’re going to be spending a lot of time separating chains moving ions around getting them into position doing the gate and then returning them to where they were.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvaGVhdnktY2FyZ28tYWlybGlmdC1kcm9uZS10by11c2UtaG9uZXl3ZWxsLW5hdmlnYXRpb24tdGVjaC0xNTkwOTEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Heavy Cargo Airlift Drone to Use Honeywell Navigation Tech,"We are used to hearing news of military drones and in recent times we’ve even grown accustomed to civilian such machines being developed for delivery purposes. But in the case of the latter the carrying capabilities don’t even come close to what the Pipistrel Nuuva V300 can do.

The “long-range large-capacity heavy-weight autonomous eVTOL UAV”’ has been purposefully designed to be used for logistics and aerial cargo delivery. Through the lifting nose of the craft up to 3 Euro-pallets (EPAL) can be loaded weighing as much as 300 kg (661 pounds).The aircraft can take off and fly with that weight for as much as 300 km (186 miles) but if one needs to transport say just 50 kg (110 pounds) the range increases to a staggering 2500 km (1553 miles) while the maximum altitude is of 8000 feet (2400 km).The Nuuva can do this thanks to the hybrid-electric powertrain it is fitted with. It comprises eight battery-powered electric motors and a cruise engine located aft of the machine. According to Pipistrel  the drone can fly fully autonomous after taking off.At the beginning of April the company announced this fly-alone capability would be backed by the next-generation Attitude Heading Reference System and Air Data Module made by Honeywell.“Unmanned aircraft especially those delivering packages must be equipped with high-performing inertial systems to ensure fly-by-wire systems are provided the best possible information on location speed and position” said in a statement Matt Picchetti vice president and general manager Navigation & Sensors Honeywell Aerospace.“Vehicles like Nuuva V300 will change the way logistics companies fulfill package deliveries and we’re proud to add our growing list of onboard technologies to enhance safety and make flying easier.”The Nuuva V300 is still under development and the company that makes it targets 2023 for its introduction.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1sYi5jb20vbmV3cy9icmVudC1ob25leXdlbGwtcmF5cy1tYWpvci1sZWFndWUtZGVidXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brent Honeywell Rays Major League debut,"

But manager Kevin Cash said the 26-year-old sent a “strong message” with his performance. Afterward Honeywell put into words what his pitching already said loud and clear.



“I know that I belong here” he said “and I know that these guys want me here.”



Honeywell took a seat in the Rays’ dugout about two hours before his first pitch watching his teammates run through defensive drills to put his mind at ease. He showed no sign of nerves when his turn on the mound came no indication that the moment was bigger than normal.



Honeywell’s fastball touched 95 mph which is what Tampa Bay saw in Spring Training. He used his changeup as his primary offspeed pitch and appeared to work in one screwball which Aaron Hicks rolled over for the final out of the first inning. He struck out Giancarlo Stanton and Gleyber Torres in the second then got Rougned Odor to pop out.



“I just kind of put it to the side and did the work. But it's a lot of fun. You definitely can't simulate it I don't think” Honeywell said. “It's something that I'll remember for the rest of my life. It was definitely a big step.”



Of course it was hardly a surprise to anyone in Tampa Bay's dugout that Honeywell appeared so composed. Starter Tyler Glasnow described Honeywell as “the most genuinely confident person I’ve ever met” and that might be putting it mildly.



“Oh he's got confidence that's for sure. You better have confidence like he does to get through what he has” Cash said before the game. “That's a credit to him. At any moment there could have been times where he really kind of derailed himself in the rehab process.

PETERSBURG — Brent Honeywell made an impressive major-league debut Sunday against the Yankees retiring all six batters he faced.

Honeywell needed only nine pitches to set down the Yankees in order in the first inning clocking as high as 95 mph with his fastball. He took just 12 pitches to get through the second. Fourteen of his 21 pitches were strikes. He also used a slider and change-up.

In the first Honeywell got DJ LeMahieu on a fly to right Aaron Judge on a ground out to second and Aaron Hicks on a grounder to first. In the second he struck out Giancarlo Stanton looking Gleyber Torres on a check-swing appeal to the first-base umpire and then newcomer Rougned Odor on a pop out.

Honeywell might not be the only show on Sunday. With two outs in the first Austin Meadows was hit on the arm by Yankees starter Jordan Montgomery. He was the third Rays batter to be hit in the three games and his teammates voiced their displeasure from the dugout. The teams have a history of such issues and the umpires issued a warning to both dugouts to try to prevent an escalation.

Honeywell 26 is the Rays’ former top pitching prospect who hurt his elbow in spring 2018 had Tommy John surgery and has been battling his way back since.

What's Next for Host Hotels?

While Host Hotels has underperformed the market so far this year the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s) but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release the estimate revisions trend for Host Hotels was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.19 on $867.21 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.45 on $2.73 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

James F. Risoleo President and Chief Executive Officer said “Host delivered comparable hotel Total RevPAR growth of 0.5% over the first quarter of 2023 which is impressive given the challenging comparison of the prior year. Banquet revenues led our performance driven by improvements in group business and continued strong demand in food and beverage. In addition we delivered net income of $272 million a decline of 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and Adjusted EBITDAre of $483 million an 8.8% improvement over the first quarter of 2023. At the same time comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.2% as a result of tough comparisons the impact of Maui and unseasonable weather in many markets that impacted short term leisure demand.”

Risoleo continued “Subsequent to quarter end we acquired the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and our strategic approach to capital allocation. This two-hotel complex further improves the quality of our portfolio and establishes a meaningful presence for Host in a top performing market. As a result of the acquisition additional business interruption insurance gains and improving out-of-room spend we kept our net income guidance flat to our previous forecast while increasing the mid-point of our Adjusted EBITDAre guidance by 2%. We tightened our full year Total RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.7% to 4.6% and our RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.0% to 4.0% based on our performance in the first quarter the evolving nature of demand in Maui and our expectations for growth in the second half of the year. Given our fortress balance sheet and successful capital allocation execution we believe Host is well positioned to continue delivering EBITDA growth.”

(1) NAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel revenues are non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally comparable hotel results and statistics include adjustments for dispositions acquisitions and non-comparable hotels. See Hotel Operating Data for RevPAR results of the portfolio based on the Company's ownership period without these adjustments.

HIGHLIGHTS:

Comparable hotel Total RevPAR was $369.58 representing an increase of 0.5% compared to first quarter of 2023 as strong contributions from group business led to an increase in food and beverage revenues with banquet and catering revenues per group room night in excess of the prior peak reached in first quarter of 2023.

Comparable hotel RevPAR was $215.37 for the first quarter of 2024 representing a decrease of 1.2% compared to first quarter of 2023 driven by the impacts of the Maui wildfires unseasonable weather conditions in several markets and unanticipated delays in renovation. In addition there were difficult comparisons to first quarter of 2023 which had experienced elevated levels of leisure demand leading to significant RevPAR growth.

GAAP net income was $272 million for first quarter of 2024 reflecting a 6.5% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decline in gain on asset sales partially offset by gains on insurance settlements recognized in the first quarter. GAAP operating profit margin was 19.8% an improvement of 180 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to the insurance gains.

Comparable hotel EBITDA was $435 million for first quarter of 2024 a 2.9% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 leading to a comparable hotel EBITDA margin decline of 140 basis points to 31.2%. The decline for the quarter was driven by increased wages and higher insurance expenses in comparison to first quarter 2023.

Adjusted EBITDAre was $483 million for first quarter of 2024 exceeding 2023 by 8.8% driven by strong operating performance at The Ritz-Carlton Naples which was closed in the first half of 2023 due to Hurricane Ian and including the benefit of the business interruption gain.

To date the Company has received insurance proceeds of $263 million out of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian. The Company received $31 million in the first quarter and $10 million of these proceeds were recognized as a gain on business interruption.

Subsequent Acquisition

On April 15 2024 the Company acquired the fee simple interest in the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for a total purchase price of $530 million. The LEED Silver® hotels comprise a two-hotel complex located in Nashville's famed Lower Broadway entertainment district across the street from Music City Convention Center and near other key points of interest and feature seven food and beverage outlets a spa two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space.



Maui Update

Impacts from the August 2023 wildfires in Maui Hawaii continued into 2024. In the first quarter the Company's Maui hotels and golf courses impacted RevPAR by 170 basis points. Operating profit margin and comparable hotel EBITDA margin were impacted by approximately 50 basis points and 30 basis points respectively for the first quarter. The first quarter impact is understated as the Company would have expected Maui to contribute 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the first quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023. As a result the total estimated impact of the wildfires on first quarter RevPAR is 310 basis points.

BALANCE SHEET

The Company maintains a robust balance sheet and completed several transactions in March and April of 2024. These transactions include:

Net draws of $215 million on the revolving credit facility (including a $300 million draw in March as well as a $65 million draw and $150 million repayment subsequent to quarter end).

Under the Hyatt Transformational Capital Program the Company received $2 million of the expected full year $9 million of operating guarantees in the first quarter of 2024 to offset business disruptions.

2024 OUTLOOK

The 2024 guidance range continues to contemplate steady demand in travel and low supply growth. In addition the range incorporates continued improvement in group business a gradual recovery in business transient demand softer short term leisure transient demand and the evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. Growth in the first half of 2024 is expected to be flat to low single-digits while the second half of the year is expected to have stronger year-over-year improvements due to better group booking pace less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and diminishing impacts from the wildfire event in Maui which occurred in early August of 2023.

Operating profit margin in 2024 is expected to increase slightly compared to 2023 while comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to decline compared to 2023 due to the impacts from the Maui wildfires and continued growth in wages real estate taxes and insurance. At the midpoint of guidance the impact from the Maui wildfires is expected to be an approximate decline of 130 basis points in RevPAR 90 basis points in Total RevPAR and 20 basis points in margins. At the midpoint in comparison to 2019 operating profit margin is expected to increase 110 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to increase 10 basis points as portfolio-wide cost reductions continue to curb inflation and benefiting from business interruption gains.

The guidance range for net income and Adjusted EBITDAre includes an additional $28 million of gains from business interruption proceeds compared to prior forecast comprised of $8 million related to Hurricane Ian and based on an estimated range of $18 million to $22 million related to the Maui wildfires which is expected to be received during the remainder of 2024. The guidance also includes an estimated $17 million and $29 million of net income and Adjusted EBITDAre respectively which is expected from the recent acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown. Due to the timing of the acquisition the results for these two hotels will be included in the comparable hotel guidance starting in the second quarter. Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California in March 2024 Alila Ventana Big Sur temporarily closed on March 30 2024 and will be removed from the forecast comparable hotel set for full year 2024.

The Company anticipates its 2024 operating results as compared to 2023 will be in the following range:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Comparable hotel Total RevPAR $352 to $359 2.7% to 4.6% 2.9% to 5.8% (60) bps Comparable hotel RevPAR $214 to $218 2.0% to 4.0% 2.5% to 5.5% (100) bps Total revenues under GAAP (in millions) $5650 to $5753 6.4% to 8.3% 5.2% to 8.1% 80 bps Operating profit margin under GAAP 15.4% to 16.1% (20) bps to 50 bps (40) bps to 70 bps (10) bps Comparable hotel EBITDA margin 29.3% to 29.8% (80) bps to (30) bps (120) bps to (40) bps 30 bps

Based upon the above parameters the Company estimates its 2024 guidance as follows:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Net income (in millions) $719 to $775 $708 to $794 $(4) Adjusted EBITDAre (in millions) $1640 to $1700 $1590 to $1680 $35 Diluted earnings per common share $1.00 to $1.08 $.99 to $1.11 $(0.01) NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share $1.97 to $2.05 $1.92 to $2.04 $0.03

(1) The Forecasts are based on the below assumptions:

Comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 2.0% to 4.0% compared to 2023 for the low and high end of the forecast range. Comparable hotel metrics do not yet include the results of 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown which were acquired in April 2024. We expect to include the comparable hotel results for these two hotels beginning in the second quarter.

Comparable hotel EBITDA margins will decrease 80 basis points to 30 basis points compared to 2023 for the low and high ends of the forecasted comparable hotel RevPAR range respectively.

We expect to spend approximately $500 million to $605 million on capital expenditures.

Includes $17 million of net income and $29 million of EBITDA from the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024. Assumes no additional acquisitions and no dispositions during the year.

Assumes a total of $38 million of gains from business interruption proceeds expected to be received in 2024 related to Hurricane Ian and related to the Maui wildfire disruption. No further business interruption gains are expected. Also includes $32 million of insurance proceeds from Hurricane Ian received through May 1 2024 that result in a gain on property insurance settlement. No further property insurance gains have been included related to Hurricane Ian. We have collected $263 million out of a potential $310 million insurance recovery related to Hurricane Ian under our policy and we continue to work with our insurers to recover the remaining amount although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result.

For a discussion of items that may affect forecast results see the Notes to Financial Information.

Notes to Financial Information

FORECASTS

Our forecast of net income earnings per diluted share NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following: potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of RevPAR; the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

COMPARABLE HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS AND RESULTS

To facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics (i.e. Total RevPAR RevPAR average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues expenses hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone large-scale capital projects in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.

We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.

The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.

Similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.

Of the 77 hotels that we owned as of March 31 2024 76 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of March 31 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

The Ritz-Carlton Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022 reopened in July 2023); and

Sales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.

Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California Alila Ventana Big Sur closed on March 30 2024 and has yet to reopen to guests. As a result the property will be removed from the comparable hotel set starting in the second quarter.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted) (ii) EBITDA (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.

NAREIT FFO AND NAREIT FFO PER DILUTED SHARE

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets gains and losses from change in control impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense –In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example in 2017 as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and therefore we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.

EBITDA

Earnings before Interest Expense Income Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.

EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control) impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.

We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:

Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense – In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.

Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) interest expense (for EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally NAREIT FFO per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as measures of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.

Similarly EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.

Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results

We present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses food and beverage profit and EBITDA (and the related margins) on a comparable hotel or ""same store"" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses these non-cash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.

Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses gains or losses on disposition certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons we believe comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management.

Numerous hardware changes that include HJS 200-cell sports cats and the Zeller downpipe have taken the six-cylinder lump to a whopping 741 PS and 880 Nm figures that convert to 731 horsepower and a whopping 649 pound-feet of torque.Take a moment and put those figures into perspective by comparing them to a modern-day land missile such as the strip-slaying McLaren 720S. Also worthy of note the most potent version of the M2 develops 450 PS (444 horsepower) and 550 Nm (406 pound-feet) of torque in stock specification.Now riding on 19-inch forged wheels and Michelin high-performance tires the car sits lower to the ground thanks to adjustable suspension from Eibach.

Slonim who had done his doctoral work on machine learning works at an I.B.M. Research facility in Tel Aviv and he had watched with pride a few days before as the company’s natural-language-processing machine Watson won “Jeopardy!” Afterward I.B.M. sent an e-mail to thousands of researchers across its global network of labs soliciting ideas for a “grand challenge” to follow the “Jeopardy!” project. It occurred to Slonim that they might try to build a machine that could defeat a champion debater. He made a single-slide presentation and then a somewhat more elaborate one and then a more elaborate one still and after many rounds competing against many other I.B.M. researchers Slonim won the chance to build his machine which he called Project Debater. Recently Slonim told me that his only wish was that when it was time for the actual debate Project Debater be given the voice of Scarlett Johansson. Instead it was given a recognizably robotic voice less flexible and punctuated than Siri’s. A basic principle of robotics is that the machine shouldn’t ever trick human beings into thinking that they are interacting with any person at all let alone one whom Esquire has twice named the “Sexiest Woman Alive.”

Scientific work inside the biggest corporations can sometimes feel as insulated and speculative as in an academic lab. It wasn’t hard to imagine that businesses might make use of Slonim’s programming—that is they might substitute a very persuasive machine for any human who interacts with people. However Slonim’s Tel Aviv-based team was not supposed to think about any of that—they were only supposed to win a debate. To Slonim that was a lot to ask. I.B.M. had built computers that had beaten human champions at chess and then at trivia and this had left the impression that A.I. was close to “humanlike intelligence” Slonim told me. He considered that “a misleading conception.” Slonim is trim and pale with a shaved head and glasses and in place of the usual boosterism about artificial intelligence he has a slight sheepishness about how new the technology is. To him the debate project was a half-step out into reality. Debate is a game like trivia or chess in that it has specific rules and structures which can be codified and taught to a machine. But it is also like real life in that the goal is to persuade a human audience to change their minds—and to do that the machine needed to know something about how they thought about the world.

Slonim was already well versed in machine learning thanks to his doctoral work. When it came to debate his only authority was national—Israelis he pointed out to me argue voluminously and he thought that his own family argued even more voluminously than most. But I.B.M.’s vast resources were brought to bear on the project and slowly during a politically tumultuous decade Project Debater took shape—it was a sort of education. The young machine learned by scanning the electronic library of LexisNexis Academic composed of news stories and academic journal articles—a vast account of the details of human experience. One engine searched for claims another for evidence and two more engines characterized and sorted everything that the first two turned up. If Slonim’s team could get the design right then in the short amount of time that debaters are given to prepare the machine could organize a mountain of empirical information. It could win on evidence.

In 2016 a debate champion was consulting on the project and he noticed that for all of its facility in extracting facts and claims the machine just wasn’t thinking like a debater. Slonim recalled “He told us ‘For me debating whether to ban prostitution or whether to ban the sale of alcohol this is the same debate. I’m going to use the same arguments. I’m just going to massage them a little bit.’ ” If you were arguing for banning prostitution or alcohol you might point to the social corrosion of vice; if you were arguing against you might warn of a black market. Slonim realized that there were a limited number of “types of argumentation” and these were patterns that the machine would need to learn. How many? Dan Lahav a computer scientist on the team who had also been a champion debater estimated that there were between fifty and seventy types of argumentation that could be applied to just about every possible debate question. For I.B.M. that wasn’t so many. Slonim described the second phase of Project Debater’s education which was somewhat handmade: Slonim’s experts wrote their own modular arguments relying in part on the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and other texts. They were trying to train the machine to reason like a human.

In February 2019 the machine had its first major public debate hosted by Intelligence Squared in San Francisco. The opponent was Harish Natarajan a thirty-one-year-old British economic consultant who a few years earlier had been the runner-up in the World Universities Debating Championship. Before they appeared onstage each contestant was given the topic and assigned a side then allotted fifteen minutes to prepare: Project Debater would argue that preschools should be subsidized by the public and Natarajan that they should not. Project Debater scrolled through LexisNexis assembling evidence and categorizing it. Natarajan did nothing like that. (When we spoke he recalled that his first thought was to wonder at the topic: Was subsidizing preschools actually controversial in the United States?) Natarajan was kept from seeing Project Debater in action before the test match but he had been told that it had a database of four hundred million documents. “I was like ‘Oh good God.’ So there was nothing I could do in multiple lifetimes to absorb that knowledge” Natarajan told me. Instead he would concede that Project Debater’s information was accurate and challenge its conclusions. “People will say that the facts speak for themselves but in this day and age that is absolutely not true” Natarajan told me. He was prepared to lay a subtle trap. The machine would be ready to argue yes expecting Natarajan to argue no. Instead he would say “Yes but . . .”

The machine a shiny black tower was placed stage right and spoke in an airy bleating voice one that had been deliberately calibrated to sound neither exactly like a human’s nor exactly like a robot’s. It began with a scripted joke and then unfurled its argument: “For decades research has demonstrated that high-quality preschool is one of the best investments of public dollars resulting in children who fare better on tests and have more successful lives than those without the same access.” The machine went on to cite supportive findings from studies: investing in preschool reduced costs by improving health and the economy while also reducing crime and welfare dependence. It quoted a statement made in 1973 by the former “Prime Minister Gough Whitlam” (the Prime Minister of Australia that is) who said subsidizing preschool was the best investment that a society could make. If that all sounded a bit high-handed Project Debater also quoted the “senior leaders at St. Joseph’s RC primary school” sprinkling in a reference to ordinary people just as a politician would. Project Debater could sound a bit like a politician too in its offhand invocation of moral first principles. Of preschools it said “It is our duty to support them.” What duties I wondered did the machine and audience share?

Natarajan who stood behind a podium at stage left wore a gray three-piece suit and spoke in a clipped confident voice. His decision not to challenge the evidence that Project Debater had assembled had a liberating effect: it allowed him to argue that the machine had taken the wrong approach to the question drawing attention to the fact that one contestant was a human and the other was not. “There are multiple things which are good for society” he said. “That could be in countries like the United States increased investment in health care which would also often have returns for education”—which Project Debater’s sources would probably also note is beneficial. Natarajan had identified the sort of expert-inflected anti-poverty argument that the machine had attempted and rather than competing on the facts he relied on a certain type of argumentation—taking in the tower of electricity a few feet from him with its Darth Vader sheen and identifying it as a dreamy idealist.

The first time I watched the San Francisco debate I thought that Natarajan won. He had taken the world that Project Debater described and tipped it on its side so that the audience wondered whether the computer was looking at things from the right angle and that seemed the decisive maneuver. In the room the audience voted for the human too: I.B.M. had beaten Kasparov and beaten the human champions of “Jeopardy!” but it had come up short against Harish Natarajan.

But when I watched the debate a second time and then a third I noticed that Natarajan had never really rebutted Project Debater’s basic argument that preschool subsidies would pay for themselves and produce safer and more prosperous societies. When he tried to he could be off the cuff to the point of ridiculousness: at one point Natarajan argued that preschool could be “actively harmful” because it could force a preschooler to recognize that his peers were smarter than he was which would cause “huge psychological damage.” By the end of my third viewing it seemed to me that man and machine were not so much competing as demonstrating different ways of arguing. Project Debater was arguing about preschool. Natarajan was doing something at once more abstract and recognizable because we see it all the time in Washington and on the cable networks and in everyday life. He was making an argument about the nature of debate.

I sent the video of the debate to Arthur Applbaum a political philosopher who is the Adams Professor of Political Leadership and Democratic Values at Harvard’s Kennedy School and who has long written about adversarial systems and their shortcomings. “First of all these Israeli A.I. scientists were enormously clever” Applbaum told me. “I have to say it’s nothing short of magic.” But Applbaum asked magic to what end? (Like Natarajan he wanted to tilt the question on its side.) The justification for having an artificial intelligence summarize and channel the ways in which people argue was that it might shed light on the underlying issue. Applbaum thought that this justification sounded pretty weak. “If we have people who are skilled in doing this thing and we listen to them doing this thing will we have a deeper more sophisticated understanding of the political questions that confront us and therefore be better-informed citizens? That’s the underlying value claim” Applbaum said. “Straightforwardly: No.”

As Applbaum saw it the particular adversarial format chosen for this debate had the effect of elevating technical questions and obscuring ethical ones. The audience had voted Natarajan the winner of the debate. But Applbaum asked what had his argument consisted of? “He rolled out standard objections: it’s not going to work in practice and it will be wasteful and there will be unintended consequences. If you go through Harish’s argument line by line there’s almost no there there” he said. Natarajan’s way of defeating the computer at some level had been to take a policy question and strip it of all its meaningful specifics. “It’s not his fault” Applbaum said. There was no way that he could match the computer’s fact-finding. “So instead he bullshat.”

I.B.M. has staged public events like the San Francisco debate as man versus machine in a way that emphasizes the competition between the two. But at their current level A.I. technologies operate more like a mirror: they learn from us and tell us something about the limits of what we know and how we think. Slonim’s team had succeeded imperfectly in teaching the machine to mimic the human mode of debate. We—or at least Harish Natarajan—are still better at that. But the machine was far better at the other part—the collection and analysis of evidence both statistical and observed. Did subsidized preschool benefit society or not? One of the positions was correct. Project Debater was more likely to assemble a strong case for the correct answer but less likely to persuade a human audience that it was true. What the audience in the hall wanted from Project Debater was for it to be more like a human: more fluid and emotional more adept at manipulating abstract concepts. But what we need from the A.I. if the goal is a more specific and empirical way of arguing is for it to be more like a machine supplying troves of usefully organized information and leaving the bullshit to us.

Whether you spend years inside the world of debate as Slonim’s consultants and Natarajan did or just a few days as I did recently you tend to see its patterns everywhere. Turn on CNN and you will quickly find politicians or pundits transforming a specific question into an abstract one. When I reached Slonim on a video call last week I found that he had grown a salt-and-pepper beard since the San Francisco debate which made him look older and more reflective. There was a note of idealism that I hadn’t heard before. He had been working on using Project Debater’s algorithms to analyze which arguments were being made online to oppose COVID-19 vaccination. He hoped he told me that they might be used to make political argument more empirical. Perhaps one day everyone would have an argument check on their smartphones much as they have a grammar check and this would help them make arguments that were not only convincing but true. Slonim said “It’s an interesting question to what extent this technology can be used to enhance the abilities of youngsters to analyze complex topics in a more rational manner.” I found it moving that the part of the technology that held the most transformative potential to make argument more empirical and true was also what made Project Debater seem most computer-like and alien. Slonim thought that this was a project for the next generation one that might outlive the current levels of political polarization. He said ruefully “Our generation is perhaps lost.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2FydGlmaWNpYWwtaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlL2libS13YXRzb24tYXBwbGljYXRpb25zLWNvbXBldGl0b3JzLWFuZC1zdWNjZXNzLXN0b3JpZXPSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbmFseXRpY3NpbnNpZ2h0Lm5ldC9hbXAvc3RvcnkvYXJ0aWZpY2lhbC1pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UvaWJtLXdhdHNvbi1hcHBsaWNhdGlvbnMtY29tcGV0aXRvcnMtYW5kLXN1Y2Nlc3Mtc3Rvcmllcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IBM Watson: Applications Competitors and Success Stories,Crédit Mutuel: Leading France's leading bank has over 5000 branches that receive more than 350000 online inquiries a day and volume is growing 23% a year.

How could technologies like blockchain that provide data to producers distributors and consumers be part of the solution?

Big data applications may present opportunities to address inefficiencies from farm to table and improve global food security.

Blockchain a linked decentralized database that stores auditable data throughout entire supply chains may change the game for food producers across the globe.

With global-scale food systems such as seafood nearly 40 per cent of which is traded globally data transparency and traceability through technologies like blockchain are important for socially and environmentally conscious decision making and to facilitate trust among stakeholders.

Gathering information

Blockchain technologies can be used to consolidate information on the quality of the seed track how crops grow and record the journey once it leaves the farm. In Canada for example Grain Discovery - an online blockchain marketplace - is an example of data being leveraged by those involved in the food system to grow and market globally competitive crops.

The data could enhance transparency in supply chains by providing immutable records from production to consumption. Such data have the potential to facilitate information transfer throughout every step of the supply chain. And if blockchains are implemented with proper validation it can prevent illegal and unethical production and distribution that undermines sustainability and community food security.

For example Wal-Mart Tsinghua University and IBM’s chain-based food traceability platforms have aided in tracing pork and mango in China and U.S. respectively with positive results in creating trust and transparency in the supply chains.

This transparency also means consumers could make informed decisions to protect vulnerable producers and the environment. Access to product data may allow consumers to reward producers who employ good practices such as rural smallholder farmers and fishermen who are among the most food-insecure groups.

Tracking pathways

Currently there is little evidence supporting the claim that blockchain and big data technologies are contributing to global food security. Even though the average farm is projected to generate 4.1 million data points by 2050 up from 190000 data points in 2014 increases in global food security have not been impressive.

Part of the challenge is how blockchains have been implemented until now. The corporate control of blockchains and big data platforms could even undermine food security.

For example IBM and Walmart have teamed up to track produce from farm to fork. Producers and processors along the supply chain are required to input information into IBM’s blockchain for the process to be entirely transparent to consumers.

However there is skepticism around IBM’s definition of blockchain as privately owned blockchains can be tampered with more easily and are less secure. This is because security of private blockchains are still highly dependent on permissions and controls set by private organizations.

Corporate-owned centralized databases of information do not meet the traditional definition of a blockchain which is based on democracy and trust.

Traditional blockchains are decentralized and democratized in order to ensure trust between users. Corporate control of supply chain information could also leave out small-scale farmers that lack the required size scale and technological know-how to participate. This division between large and small food producers can contribute to global food insecurity and many researchers believe that small as well as large farms are required to feed the world’s growing population.

Data and food futures

Before blockchain and other data technologies can help address food security a number of challenges need to be addressed.

The implementation of blockchains must be be decentralized to include small farmers and rural people. This will enable sustainable and equitable food systems and allow consumers to make informed decisions.

However as blockchains place additional responsibility on the end users challenges such as limited digital literacy among the world’s poor and infrastructure constraints may undermine true decentralization.

Also they must be integrated into broader food security promotion strategies to make them sensitive to social and environmental values critical to tackling food insecurity among diverse groups.

The untapped potential of harnessing big data through a transparent and decentralized food distribution system may support sustainable food production and provide accountability for food production.

This is crucial for efficient food systems and food security in the future. But it is important that these innovations are deployed equitably so that all stakeholders along the value chain may benefit."

The head of the world's leading genetic sequencing company predicts a future where genomic data will increasingly drive health care. Why it matters: As our ability to read genes gets faster and cheaper genetic sequencing could pave the way for everything from enhanced disease surveillance to truly personalized care.

Driving the news: Illumina which controls roughly 90% of the market for genetic sequencing machines in the U.S. announced earlier this week it earned record revenue of $1.09 billion in the first quarter of 2021.

The company is projecting revenue growth of 25–28% in fiscal year 2021 over the previous year.

Details: That growth is due in large part to ""the extraordinarily massive and urgent human needs of the pandemic"" Illumina CEO Francis DeSouza told Axios in an interview.

Genetic sequencing machines like the ones produced by Illumina were how scientists were able to rapidly decode the genome of SARS-CoV-2 and start building both tests and the mRNA vaccines that will ultimately curb the pandemic.

Our ability to track more dangerous virus mutations like B.1.1.7 was only possible because gene sequencing technology had gotten faster cheaper and more widespread.

What's next: It cost $1000 for Illumina to sequence a human genome in 2014 but the company expects to reach the $100 level within a couple of years.

Ultra-cheap sequencing — combined with an ever-increasing understanding of the genome — will result in genetics becoming ""the foundational element of your health record"" he says.

What to watch: The growth of liquid biopsies — tests that can find the genetic markers of cancer in blood samples.

Illumina is in the process of a $7.1 billion acquisition of Grail a company that has developed liquid biopsies for dozens of cancers but the Federal Trade Commission last week moved to block the acquisition on competitive grounds.

DeSouza contests the FTC's case that the acquisition will ultimately increase the cost of liquid biopsies arguing Illumina can help get Grail's diagnostics to market faster and accelerate reimbursements for ""underserved populations that can't afford the test.""

The bottom line: Just as WWI helped accelerate the development of airplanes and WWII nuclear technology ""I believe we will look back and view the pandemic as ushering the era of biology and the era of the genome"" says DeSouza.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Allí trabajaba desde 1976 Alfonso Antoñanzas padre de nuestro entrevistado como responsable de I+D. En 1992 Koxka perdió su carácter familiar al ser adquirida por la multinacional Hussmann y la sección de Antoñanzas se convirtió en la ingeniería para toda la multinacional que entonces contaba con 6.000 empleados y que fue vendida diez años después a la división financiera de Ingersoll Rand.

«Lo que Ingersoll Rand transmite al mercado es que el producto de Koxka es como un boli Bic un commodity y coge toda la ingeniería y la destroza». Daniel Antoñanzas refuerza esta frase alzando un bolígrafo que deja caer sobre la mesa. La consecuencia fue que «Alfonso y otros ingenieros salieron» de la empresa. Daniel siempre alude a su padre por el nombre no por el parentesco que los une y en ocasiones habla de «nosotros» para referirse genéricamente a la familia o a la empresa. Incluso lo hace para aludir a hechos en los que él no participó como los referidos a Koxka. «Alfonso que tenía entonces 55 años y los otros ingenieros niegan que nuestros muebles sean un commodity sino que son algo que se puede desarrollar ¡y mucho! Lo que hacen es generar otra empresa que es esta: Exposición y Conservación de Alimentos Exkal« añade.

Daniel nació en Pamplona hace 49 años estudió Ingeniería Industrial en la UPNA y un Máster en Comercio Internacional. «Nosotros venimos de una familia empresaria y desde muy pequeño me inculcaron el valor del dinero y de las personas. Más el de las personas a quererlas que el del dinero que solo es el aprender a ganártelo. Cuando hablamos del grupo de empresas de Exkal estamos hablando de más de 1.500 familias. Esa es una de las características de una empresa familiar: que no tiene números o mano de obra a su cargo sino familias. Eso es importante porque las decisiones no las estás tomando desde un punto de vista económico sino social en función de esas 1.500 familias”.

«En una empresa familiar no tomas las decisiones desde un punto de vista económico sino social».

Empezó a trabajar en cuanto salió de la universidad. Una de las ramas de Exkal se dedica a la distribución y comercialización de material eléctrico y en aquel momento se exigió a los electricistas la renovación de su carné profesional de instalador.

La empresa organizó entonces un curso gratuito de casi 250 horas que impartió Daniel y por el que pasaron cerca de 150 personas de diferentes talleres y negocios que tenían la necesidad de recalificarse.

TRES AÑOS EN CHINA

Su segunda ocupación fue en una empresa creada conjuntamente con Gamesa: «Empecé como becario y terminé siendo su gerente». En 2009 Exkal ya tenía tres años había hecho importantes inversiones y empezaban a notarse los primeros efectos de la crisis financiera. Daniel se había incorporado al staff que vio la necesidad de «hacer cosas rupturistas» porque era preciso internacionalizarla. «Alfonso cogió una maleta y se fue a vivir a México y yo cogí otra y me marché a China» rememora. Así nacieron Exkal México y Exkal China. Se fue con 30 años y estuvo tres allá. «Hoy es una filial comercial e industrial del grupo que fabrica y vende en Asia. No traemos ninguno de sus productos terminados sí algunas materias primas y es un punto importante de compra global para las diversas plantas tenemos en el mundo».

En 2012 volvió a España se hizo cargo de la división industrial después asumió la gerencia y en paralelo» comenzó la transición generacional. «Decidimos que fuera un proceso tranquilo. Hoy Alfonso tiene 70 años sigue siendo el director general de Exkal y poco a poco va desapareciendo de la operativa para pasar a la estrategia. Yo me voy haciendo cargo de la operativa como director gerente».

«El éxito de Exkal se debe a las personas a contar con un equipo de trabajo enormemente eficaz de capacidades ilimitadas».

Sigue siendo una empresa familiar pero ha dejado de ser una pyme. De hecho ha subido a la categoría de gran empresa a causa de su éxito. Se puso en marcha en abril de 2005 en Pamplona en unas instalaciones que enseguida se quedaron pequeñas y en mayo del año siguiente se inauguró la planta de Marcilla. Una que tuvo que ampliarse al cabo de un año.

Después abrió delegaciones en Cataluña Levante y Andalucía y en 2009 hizo lo propio con las fábricas de México y China. En 2013 surgieron Exkal Francia y Colombia y en 2015 Exkal Emirates y Bélgica. Al preguntarle por el secreto de semejante crecimiento Daniel lo tiene claro: «Se debe a las personas a haber generado un equipo de trabajo enormemente eficaz con unas capacidades ilimitadas y muy joven. El Comité de Dirección lo componemos siete personas: Alfonso tiene 70 años dos estamos en torno a los 40 y los cuatro restantes por debajo de los 35. Es una apuesta por generar un equipo con una cultura y unos valores potentes. A eso hay que añadir mucha innovación e investigación y la globalización». Así ha alcanzado el 42 % de cuota de mercado en España el 19 % en Francia y en torno al 4 % en el conjunto de Europa pero compite con empresas que tienen cuotas diez veces superiores a nivel europeo.

Entre 2016 y 2017 se transformó en una empresa 4.0 al 100 %. Y en septiembre de 2018 anunció una inversión de 25 millones de euros para ampliar las instalaciones duplicar la producción y crear 500 puestos de trabajo. Por cierto ¿esos objetivos se han visto trastocados por la pandemia? Con una media sonrisa afirma que los objetivos «siguen creciendo»: «Ya no son 25 millones sino 42». Y añade un enigmático anuncio: «Vamos a añadir una integración vertical que verá su luz a finales de mayo. Es una tecnología alemana por la que pagaremos un royalty y sobre la que investigaremos en Marcilla además de fabricar el producto. Generaremos conocimiento en Navarra para el mundo« avanza. Por el momento no precisa más.

RESPONSABILIDAD MEDIOAMBIENTAL

«Europa con el European Green Deal espera ahorrar 260 teravatios/hora en 2030. Y de esos 56 corresponden a este sector» precisa golpeando repetidamente la mesa con su dedo índice. Daniel recalca así la responsabilidad de esta industria a la hora de alcanzar el objetivo del H2030 que conlleva la reducción de un 55 % en las emisiones de efecto invernadero. Una tarea en la que están contribuyendo de forma notable los refrigerantes: «Hoy nuestros muebles utilizan refrigerantes naturales. Podemos reducir no el 55 % sino el 100% de las emisiones. Además ahorran un 32 % de energía» proclama señalando las fotografías que cuelgan en la pared: «Este es un mueble de 2009 que consumía 1.200 vatios por metro cuadrado. Estos otros consumen 400 y este que fabricamos desde hace un año gasta 300».

«No vendemos muebles de refrigeración comercial sino soluciones a las que añadimos diferenciales para buscar el efecto ¡guau! de los clientes».

Exkal no solo está comprometida con la preservación del medio ambiente también con el progreso de Navarra. «Ya no es suficiente con la satisfacción de los clientes hay que sorprenderles ágil y continuamente. Y no solo a ellos sino también a los grupos de interés. Nuestra meta hoy es maximizar el valor de nuestros grupos de interés: clientes empleados proveedores acreedores socios y la Comunidad de Navarra por la que trabajamos y en la que nos implicamos mucho a través del Consejo Asesor de Fundación Industrial Navarra y el Consejo de Expertos de la UPNA. También somos cofundadores de la Fundación Luzia para la inteligencia artificial formamos parte de ADEFAN… Por ejemplo con la Fundación Luzia damos un curso para fomentar las vocaciones STEM entre chicos y chicas de 14 años y con ADEFAN otro para promover el emprendimiento en esas edades. Además participamos en las cátedras de Refrigeración Industrial y de Empresa Familiar de la UPNA y hemos creado una empresa GLS (Global & Local Solutions) a la que el Gobierno de Navarra ha reconocido como unidad de I+D+i empresarial. Es como un centro tecnológico pero dentro de una empresa«.

Cuando Daniel desarrolla sus conceptos teóricos no siempre es fácil seguirle: «Buscamos generar una cultura de cambio en la empresa. Ya no es suficiente la mejora incremental de modo que tenemos que añadirle la mejora disruptiva. Pero para lograrlo no basta la innovación que es hacer productos con conceptos que otros han investigado. Necesitamos investigar generar conceptos. Ese es uno de los objetivos de GLS y al que dedico una parte importante de mi tiempo». Las investigaciones se hacen de la mano de los institutos de investigación de la UPNA: Naitec y el equipo de investigación en materia de frío industrial que dirige David Astráin.

En cualquier caso parece tener las ideas muy claras y las expone sin titubeos. «Nuestros productos han sido siempre diferenciales en tecnología y servicio. No vendemos muebles de refrigeración comercial sino soluciones a las que vamos a ir añadiendo más y más diferenciales para buscar el efecto ¡guau! de los clientes». En algún momento dice que su empresa «se mueve a otros niveles» e intuimos que es cierto.

Intel's 11th-Gen Rocket Lake processors have finally been cleared for liftoff with the eight-core $539 Core i9-11900K taking on AMD's potent Ryzen 9 5900X that leads our CPU Benchmark hierarchy while the six-core $262 Core i5-11600K slots in with more palatable pricing as the mainstream gaming chip to challenge AMD's Ryzen 5 5600X our current Best CPU for gaming.



The 14nm Rocket Lake family arrives during dark times for Intel in the desktop PC market. AMD's Zen-fueled assault on the desktop has culminated in its powerful Zen 3-powered Ryzen 5000 chips taking the uncontested lead in nearly every metric that matters including in Intel's long-held gaming stronghold.



Intel says Rocket Lake will retake the gaming crown but the devastating fallout of the company's failure to transition to 10nm desktop PC chips now ripples through a fifth generation of its processors. As a result Rocket Lake comes fabbed on the seventh and presumably final iteration of Intel's 14nm process for desktop processors. This after having soldiered on since 2015 as Intel's longest-lived leading-edge node.



However Rocket Lake comes with a powerful new addition — Cypress Cove Intel's first new architecture for desktop PC chips in six years which Intel says grants a 19% increase in IPC. But Cypress Cove comes with a big tradeoff: Rocket Lake tops out at eight cores and sixteen threads a step back from the previous-gen 10-core Comet Lake i9 models that pales in comparison to AMD's beastly 16-core Ryzen 9 5950X flagship.

The lowered core count is an unavoidable side effect of Intel basing its new architecture on a design that originally debuted with its 10nm Ice Lake processors but the decision to etch it onto the 14nm process left its chip designers with a leaner transistor density budget that ultimately resulted in fewer cores.

Intel says this tactic which is called backporting was necessary because 10nm couldn't support the higher frequencies needed for desktop PCs. Intel claims the increased IPC and faster frequencies should offset the reduced core count in most work. However as you'll see in our testing the reduced core count can lead to lower gen-on-gen performance in some heavily-threaded applications. That certainly hasn't stopped Intel from charging a premium for its new 11900K flagship though which comes with a $51 upcharge over the prior-gen model.



Rocket Lake has plenty of notable advances though: Intel stepped forward to faster DRAM speeds (though that comes with a big caveat) finally adopted the PCIe 4.0 interface added AVX-512 support and AI-boosting DL Boost technology and also moved to the integrated UHD Graphics 750 engine that hails from the company's 10nm Tiger Lake chips. Rocket Lake also has other gaming optimizations with added support for Resizable Bar which boosts gaming performance with supported discrete GPUs. The chips also cater to the enthusiast crowd with a host of overclocking features to wring more performance from the silicon including unlocked memory overclocking with cheaper B- and H-series motherboards.



However while much of AMD's successful formula has consisted of more cores a newer architecture and a denser 7nm node Intel has launched its new flagship on an older less-efficient 14nm node with fewer cores. As a result Intel has attempted to offset the reduced core count by dialing power consumption to the extreme to maximize performance. The Core i9-11900K is impressive in gaming and lightly-threaded work but it trails the similarly-priced Ryzen 9 5900X by large margins in threaded applications and doesn't cement itself well enough as a gaming leader to justify its premium price tag.

Meanwhile the six-core twelve thread Core i5-11600K lands with a much friendlier $262 price point that's much more competitive with AMD's comparable chips. In light of its price point it has a very competitive price-to-performance ratio with the $300 Ryzen 5 5600X in a broad swath of games and applications. While the Core i5-11600K might not claim absolute supremacy its mixture of price and performance makes it a solid buy. Provided of course that you can find any of these chips at close to sane pricing.

Intel Rocket Lake Core i9-11900K and Core i5-11600K Specifications and Pricing

Intel spreads the Rocket Lake (RKL-S) chips across the familiar Core i9 i7 and i5 families but Comet Lake Refresh (CML-R) chips step in for Core i3 and Pentium. Those chips feature the same architecture as other Comet Lake chips but come with slightly increased clock speeds. You can find more detail on those models here.

Intel's chip frequencies have become a confusing array of four different flavors of Turbo Boost many with both single- and multi-core ratios that differ based on each family of chips. We've narrowed these listings down to the peak boost frequencies in the table below with each indicating the peak boosting tech used. We've also narrowed down the list of chips to the most important models. We'll circle back with a complete list of chips specs and boost definitions on the following page.

As we've seen for several chip generations Intel also offers graphics-less F-series models that have the same specs as their full-featured counterparts but come at a lower price point. Keep those in mind if you don't need integrated graphics.



The eight-core Core i9-11900K slots in as the flagship model for the Rocket Lake family. Fast clock speeds are a clear attraction but they come at the expense of power — two of the chip's cores boost to a peak of 5.3 GHz and all cores can operate at 4.8 GHz simultaneously. The 11900K has a 125W PL1 power rating (at the base frequency) and a 250W PL2 (boost) rating both of which are identical to the previous-gen 10900K despite having two fewer cores.

The Core i9 K and KF models are Intel's first chips to come with Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT) which allows the processors to dynamically boost to higher all-core frequencies based upon available thermal headroom and electrical conditions (a bit more detail below). This new tech will feel decidedly familiar to AMD fans as it operates in a very similar fashion to AMD's existing boost mechanism that's present in newer Ryzen processors.

The eight-core 16-thread flagship Core i9-11900K comes with a suggested $539 price tag a $51 markup over the previous-gen ten-core 10900K. The 11900K slots in for $10 less than the Ryzen 9 5900X which means we're looking at an eight-core chip taking on a 12-core 24-thread chip that will easily beat it in threaded workloads. Intel's obvious goal here is to beat the 5900X at gaming so it can justify the price tag.

Notably Intel's non-K Core i9 and i7 models carry the same pricing as their prior-gen counterparts. As per usual K SKUs come without coolers and you'll need a capable cooler to unlock the best of Rocket Lake.

The $399 Core i7-11700K slots into the massive pricing gap between the $299 Ryzen 5 5600X and $449 Ryzen 7 5800X . Core counts are no longer the distinction between the Core i9 and Core i7 families — both families come with eight cores and 16 threads. Instead a few frequency bins separate the chips courtesy of Intel's ABT and Thermal Velocity Boost tech and the differences in memory Gear modes that we'll explain below. As such the 11700K tops out 5 GHz on two cores via Turbo Boost 3 tech and all cores can stretch up to 4.6 GHz simultaneously. At $399 Intel commands a $25 premium over the previous-gen 10700K.

The Core i5-11600K contends directly with the $299 Ryzen 5 5600X in the heart of the mainstream gaming market so this is an exceptionally important model. The $262 six-core Core i5-11600K matches the pricing of the previous-gen i5-10600K. The 11600K boosts to a peak of 4.9 GHz on two cores and can maintain a 4.6 GHz all-core frequency.

The 11600K comes with a 125W PL1 rating the same as the previous-gen 10600K but has a 251W PL2 a whopping 69W increase compared to the previous 182W limit.

The Core i5-11400 also stands out as a potentially great deal with $182 (or $157 for the F-series part) being a solid price for a six-core 12-thread processor. We have this processor inbound for review.

Intel has stepped forward from DDR4-2933 to DDR4-3200 but the company also introduced a new paradigm with Rocket Lake: Only the Core i9 chips support DDR4-3200 in an optimal configuration at stock settings. This setting is called 'Gear 1' and signifies that the memory controller and memory operate at the same frequency (1:1) thus providing the lowest latency and best performance in lightly-threaded work like gaming.

All other Rocket Lake chips only officially support DDR4-3200 with the 'Gear 2' setting which allows the memory to operate at twice the frequency of the memory controller (2:1) and results in higher data transfer rates which can benefit some threaded workloads but also results in higher latency that can lead to reduced performance in some applications.

Intel justifies the new segmentation approach because memory controllers fall into the binning equation meaning chips with slower controllers are only rated for DDR4-3200 in Gear 2 mode. The official top speed for the Gear 1 setting is DDR4-2933 for all Core i7 and i5 chips and running DDR4-3200 in lower-latency Gear 1 mode is considered overclocking. Intel isn't known for harsh memory overclocking restrictions when processing returns but running memory beyond the spec does technically void your warranty.

Intel's Rocket Lake Die Shots and Comparisons

Image 1 of 1 (Image credit: Der8auer.com)

We aren't prepared to sacrifice our sample by doing a risky delid but a daring enthusiast recently delidded a Core i7-11700K processor and shared the results . We used the resulting photos to calculate Rocket Lake's die's size through a photo lineup compiled from Der8auer's die analysis article (via @harukaze5719 ).

Intel has confirmed that all Rocket Lake-S chips come with the same eight-core die with two cores disabled for the six-core models. Surprisingly based on our rough projections Rocket Lake's eight-core die is about 34% larger than the ten-core Comet Lake die.



In an odd twist this could be a good development for enthusiasts because it should help make the chips easier to cool compared to the previous-gen models — the 11900K has the same peak power specifications and 34% more silicon area from which to dissipate the thermal load. That should bode well for the six core models too which have more inactive silicon to help absorb heat from neighboring cores. However Intel has obviously decided to consume the extra thermal headroom by increasing the 11600K's power limit under heavy load by 69 watts.

Intel chalks much of the die size disparity up to GPU and CPU cores that are physically larger than those found on Comet Lake a byproduct of backporting from 10nm to 14nm along with the increased number of graphics EUs.

Intel could have shrunk or removed the integrated graphics engine to cram in more CPU cores within its power performance area and cost (PPAC) targets but integrated graphics are a key requirement for the high-volume OEM systems market that tends to leverage on-chip graphics rather than discrete GPUs. As a result Intel says it chose this balance of units to meet its design goals across the broader desktop PC market.

Intel's 14nm process is ultra-mature so we assume yields are superb and also that the majority of its chipmaking equipment is depreciated meaning it should be relatively cost-effective to punch out a flood of Rocket Lake chips while AMD remains supply constrained. However fabbing a larger die exposes the chips to a greater chance of defects thus complicating the binning process potentially reducing yield and resulting in fewer die per wafer. All of these factors conspire to increase manufacturing costs which could help explain Intel's higher pricing for its highest-binned SKUs.

For the last few years that’s the metaphor that has come to mind whenever Intel was mentioned. For as long as most of us can remember it has been the lumbering supertanker of the silicon chip business because its central processing units (CPUs) powered most computers.

But from 2007 onwards when smartphones which are really just handheld computers arrived that world began to change and dominance in the CPU business passed to the Cambridge company Arm which designed CPUs that were smaller and consumed far less power than their predecessors. Intel like its erstwhile partner Microsoft seemed lost in this new environment; they were like two supertankers drifting aimlessly while continuing to make comfortable profits from their legacy businesses. Watching the apparently relentless growth of Arm and Intel’s flailing attempts to make progress (including in areas such as semiconductor lithography the physical and chemical processes needed to etch circuits on silicon which should have been a core competency) it was hard to see a future for it except one of inexorable decline.

All of which made the news that Intel had a new CEO who was not behaving like a traditional Intel boss such a surprise. His name is Pat Gelsinger and although he started his career at Intel for the last 11 years he’s been working in smaller companies. But he’s back with a vengeance as one began slowly to realise when watching the talk he gave after less than 40 days at the helm outlining the most radical shift in strategy since Andy Grove and Gordon Moore switched the company from making memory chips and into making processors more than 35 years ago.

Gelsinger’s ideas look genuinely radical especially for a company with an organisational culture as powerful as Intel’s. He plans to outsource some chip manufacturing including some of his highest-spec processors to third-parties. To get a feeling of what a shock that is to the Intel system it would be like Apple outsourcing iPhone design to Ikea. But at the same time Intel isn’t abandoning its historical roots of being both a designer and a manufacturer of chips and it will retain most of its production in-house. And Gelsinger is also proposing to make chips for others companies and targeting customers such as Apple and Qualcomm.

The two most interesting things about Gelsinger’s talk (for this viewer anyway) were its frankness and its implicit recognition of the way geopolitics now plays a key role in chip manufacturing. He was remarkably candid about how Intel has screwed up in recent years by backing the wrong technology in lithography. As he talked one imagined some of his colleagues squirming in embarrassment as the extent of their misjudgments were outlined even if their new boss went out of his way to seem non-judgmental.

If western companies were to lose access to Taiwanese foundries you might have to wait a long time for your new iPhone

But in a way his most intriguing revelation concerned the nature and location of the massive new manufacturing plants that he proposes to build. Creating a silicon chip involves two processes: the design of the circuits to be etched on to the silicon and manufacturing the designed objects at phenomenal scale. The second process happens in what are – quaintly – called silicon “foundries” plants that manufacture chips for customers such as Apple Qualcomm Samsung et al.

Geopolitics intrudes at this point because at the moment the dominant foundries are all located in Taiwan and to a lesser extent South Korea both states that lie uncomfortably within China’s sphere of interest. Gelsinger’s presentation contained a slide showing that of the world’s chip-manufacturing capacity 80% is located in that part of the world while 15% is located in the US and only 5% in Europe.

In recent times tensions between the US and China have escalated especially under Trump and American pressure on chip manufacturers to avoid supplying Huawei has raised the temperature considerably. China doesn’t have an indigenous chip-manufacturing capability and Taiwan is well only a few miles away – and was once a part of China. You don’t have to be a genius to spot a strategic vulnerability: if western companies were to lose access to those Taiwanese foundries well… you might have to wait a long time for your new iPhone.

Gelsinger has spotted the problem – and the opportunity. Intel has advanced foundries in Oregon New Mexico and Arizona but they make chips only for its own integrated systems. A key part of his turnaround plan is that the company will greatly expand its foundry capacity – in Europe as well as the US – and that it will manufacture chips for anyone who wants them. And funnily enough earlier this month the EU budgeted £116bn for a drive towards “digital sovereignty” aspiring to increase its share of the global semiconductor market from 10% to 20% by 2030. You’d have to be a dumb skipper to ignore a catch like that.

Recently we reviewed the Intel NUC 11 Pro and Intel had sent a second NUC the Intel NUC 11 Compute Element (AV edition) as well. In this article we are going to review this new version along the lines of the over three dozen Project TinyMiniMicro nodes we have reviewed already. With that let us get to the review.

Intel NUC 11 Compute Element (AV Edition) Overview

On the front of the system we have a power button USB 3.2 Gen2 (10Gbps) and USB 2.0 port. This is lower-connectivity than many of the corporate desktop PCs that usually have 2-3 USB 3 ports potentially one as a Type-C port and a headset jack on the front panel.

In terms of size the Fort Beach chassis is 200 x 150 x 35mm. That makes it also around 1L and significantly larger than the NUC 11 Pro we reviewed a few weeks ago.

That 1L chassis is a bit smaller but roughly the same size as one of the ~1L PCs from Lenovo HP and Dell we have covered in Project TinyMiniMicro. Here is the NUC atop the HP EliteDesk 800 G6 Mini as an example. The Project TMM nodes are slightly larger but it is very close.

The rear of the NUC has a much larger I/O expansion capability. Standard we get a DC input (we received a 90W power adapter with this.) There are two HDMI ports for video output (more on the others soon.) We also get four USB ports. Two are USB 3.2 Gen2 and two are USB 2.0. That gives us a total of three of each generation when we add them to the front panel ports.

On the networking side we have dual 1GbE. One port is powered by an Intel i211-AT NIC.

The other uses the onboard Intel i219-LM MAC. Something to be aware of there is that Ubuntu Server 20.04.2 LTS did not automatically detect the i219-LM.

The importance of the Intel i219-LM is that it can also act as a management interface for Intel AMT/ vPro. Our unit has vPro but many do not so it is worth checking the Elk Bay module you are using here.

One of the big features of this chassis is the top section with HDMI ports labeled “Pass Thru” “Input” and Audio Out/In. These ports are a capture card that is built into this chassis. Here we have an Atomos Ninja V 4K external recorder that also has a similar HDMI output. That Atomos is popular for higher-end 4K recording but it is not attached to a PC so it cannot stream video as an example.

The capture card is an AVerMedia CO513EC device. AVerMedia makes many of these capture cards and so it was a good choice by Intel to leverage them as a partner.

As you can see this is a USB device. The device itself is built into the chassis but is connected via a USB cable.

As you likely have seen there are two M.2 slots onboard for SSDs these have thermal pads that help transfer heat from the SSDs to the bottom of the chassis for cooling.

The major feature here is the Intel NUC 11 Compute Element. This Intel NUC 11 Compute Element has the CPU memory and WiFi/ Bluetooth on a small card.

The CPU is an Intel Core i7-1185G7 quad-core CPU. This is still a lower wattage Tiger Lake part but it is also a 10nm part that has some of Intel’s newest features.

Here we can see the 4 core/ 8 thread CPU with 12MB of cache and Intel Xe graphics. This card has more than just the CPU though. Much like an Apple Mac Mini M1 it also has onboard soldered memory. Here we have not just DDR4 but LPDDR4x-4267 and 16GB of it. This also means that the memory is not upgradeable. For lower-end CPU options one also gets less memory. Compared to Project TinyMiniMicro nodes one cannot tune each independently and there are only six possible 11th gen CPU + Memory options on the market in this form factor.

One other item that the NUC 11 Compute Element has is onboard WiFi 6 and Bluetooth. Here we can see the Intel AX201 NIC with antenna wires connected.

Effectively what the NUC 11 Compute Element does is package the CPU RAM and WiFi all into a small card. One can then plug this card into a larger motherboard. The market already has a model for socketed/ slotted CPU RAM and WiFi. This is a smaller packaging but it is also much more constrained from a configuration standpoint. Also since one is buying the proprietary Compute Element from Intel that means pricing is controlled by Intel and one may not get the benefit of falling DRAM prices as an example.

Since we know this is a bit confusing before we move on here is an Ark link to the main components of this solution.

Next let us get to the performance and the remainder of our review.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2hwLWJyaW5ncy0xMXRoLWdlbi1pbnRlbC1wcm9jZXNzb3JzLXRvLWNocm9tZWJvb2steDM2MC0xNGMtY29udmVydGlibGUtbGFwdG9wL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP brings 11th-gen Intel processors to Chromebook x360 14c convertible laptop,"HP Chromebook x360 14c

ZDNET Recommends The best Chromebooks in 2022 These Chromebook laptops feature low prices and long battery lives. Read now

HP first released its Chromebook x360 14 convertible laptops back in 2018 matching a larger 14.1-inch display and Intel Core processors with the then-burgeoning 2-in-1 form factor trend and giving it a midrange price tag. Since then Intel has evolved from eighth-generation Core CPUs to its 11th generation (a.k.a. Tiger Lake) and HP has updated the Chromebook x360 14 accordingly most recently a couple of days ago when it divulged that new models with Tiger Lake-U processors will be available later this month.

Specifically HP announced two new configurations for the x360 14c one available through Best Buy and the other through HP's own online store. The Best Buy version ships with a Core i3-1115G4 processor along with 8 gigs of RAM and a 128GB solid-state drive. The $649 Chromebook has a product page already if you want full specs but it's currently listed as ""Coming Soon"" with no ability to pre-order. That's more than HP has up at present for the Core i5-1135G7 edition though we know it will be available with as much as 256GB of storage.

In addition to the processor refresh the new 14c laptops get a couple of other minor changes including Corning Gorilla Glass 5 coating for the touchscreen. While the new processors will provide better performance than their predecessors it comes at the cost of some battery life with HP's claimed battery performance dipping to 10.5 hours from 13.5 hours for last year's model.

Otherwise the 2021 Chromebook x360 14c retains some of the same specs as the 2018 original such as the 1920x1080 full 1080p HD screen resolution and two USB-C ports and one USB-A port. It also keeps the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI) support that the 14b model received in 2019.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9pbnRlbC1ibGVlcC10b3hpY2l0eS1maWdodGluZy1zb2Z0d2FyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel's Toxicity-Fighting Software Has A Toggle For The N-Word,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9pbnRlbC1ibGVlcC10b3hpY2l0eS1maWdodGluZy1zb2Z0d2FyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

What's Next for International Flavors?

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties including but not limited to the issuer.

Foreword

Some national strategies are designed to endure for a few years a single administration at most—but such an approach will not suffice for outer space.

Security and prosperity in space are too important to life on Earth and too sensitive to long-term trends to address with short-term strategies. The security of assets in space will have a defining impact on future terrestrial conflicts. Economic prosperity on Earth increasingly depends on data transmitted through space. Even more so than many domains on Earth security and prosperity in space depend on long-term technology developments. That is why the authors of this strategy paper call for the United States in concert with its allies and partners to implement a thirty-year strategy for space.

The ambitions of this strategy paper are bold enough to merit such a timeframe. The authors call for an overhaul of the body of international law governing space. They make a compelling case to replace the 1967 Outer Space Treaty with a new foundational space treaty that addresses the security and commercial realities of space in the twenty-first century. The authors call for a new coalition of the willing to push back on recent destabilizing Russian and Chinese activities in space. New alliances—and existing ones—need to step up their commitments to security in outer space. An attack in outer space could have devastating consequences on Earth and no ally should be left without support because existing treaties do not yet fully recognize the consequences of space attacks. Finally the legal security and physical architectures that the United States develops over the coming decades must explore opportunities for the commercial sector to plug in or even take over elements. Not only will commercial firms be crucial to developing the technologies that will define space activity but there will also by 2050 be a range of profit-making activities in space that one can only begin to imagine today. The United States can develop plans for space now in a way that enables it to benefit later.

Crucially the authors of this strategy paper take on two developments in space that require deep thinking now because of their impact in coming decades. First this paper considers point-to-point transportation around the Earth transiting space. As space-launch costs continue to plummet the military is already conceiving the use of space ports for thirty-minute transportation to any point on Earth. Clever commercial applications will be only a few years behind. Work must begin on legal and diplomatic frameworks now. Second this strategy explores the development of the Lagrange points—orbits in the Earth-Sun and Earth-Moon systems with advantageous stable gravitational attraction. Space agencies already understand the benefits of placing satellites at these points. Will these become chokepoints over which spacefaring nations battle or oases of future space commerce? This strategy suggests that the United States must work for the latter while being prepared for the former.

The bold forward-looking recommendations of this strategy call for the kind of long-term thinking and practical actions that the United States needs today if it is to secure the commanding heights of security and prosperity a generation hence. Our hope is that space foreign policy and national security policy makers are inspired to act based on this landmark strategy paper. We are.

Executive summary

Across cultures centuries and continents exploration has been core to the human experience. For the United States where crucial advances in astronomy rocketry and space exploration took place its identity as a spacefaring nation is ingrained in its history society and self-image. As Ed Weiler the Hubble Space Telescope’s first chief scientist said some thirty years ago “The universe is even more complex than we dream. Almost everywhere we look we find something bizarre.”

Today activity in space seems an unremarkable part of daily life but the possibility for space to further transform and inspire society is as great as the headiest days of the 1960s space race. Many questions remain unanswered about the future of space development but space remains critical for global security and prosperity and will become even more so in the decades and centuries to come. Conducted over the course of a year this Atlantic Council Strategy Paper provides an ambitious thirty-year strategy for the United States alongside its allies and partners to harness today’s innovation shape the future trajectory of space activity and discovery and secure this evolving domain to ensure future prosperity so that humankind can exponentially reap its benefits.

Since the launch of the first satellite in 1957 space has grown congested with more and smaller satellites being launched into Earth orbits. Limited space situational awareness and insufficient space traffic management risk satellite collisions which could generate space debris endangering the use of these orbits.

Four developments defining the future of space

Four major developments together provide both an opportunity and a requirement for the United States and its allies and partners to define the future of space activity and adopt a long-term space strategy. These are:

The boundless potential of space for humankind

Increased reliance on space for human activity. For the United States its allies and partners spacefaring nations and humanity at large space holds the potential to revolutionize Earth’s economy security and potentially the nature of human civilization itself. Outer space has for decades been a vital resource—one that both enables security and prosperity on Earth and is rapidly becoming the locus of an increasingly large share of humankind’s economy. Space enables critical economic and security activities on Earth. The global economy depends on communications navigation timing and remote sensing that occur in space—the US economy more so than any other. For the United States space is also essential for national security missions including launching intercontinental ballistic missiles detecting and tracking missile launches communicating securely with forces deployed across the globe and observing otherwise-denied areas.

A promise of radical abundance and resilience. Recognizing the known and unknown values of space to humankind means that this still-relatively-new domain will increase in importance in the coming decades and centuries. Humankind still has much to discover in this vastly unknown frontier and enabling further exploration will uncover resources integral to the resilient existence of life on Earth. Space holds virtually unlimited sources of energy vast amounts of useful materials and untapped potential to provide a “radical abundance” of resources for humankind in the future. These developments could lead to “radical resilience” for societies or generally position humanity to better respond to challenges like climate change on Earth. Space has been invaluable for producing wealth spurring commerce and winning wars for decades—but a qualitatively different aspect to space is emerging today and may be primary in thirty years’ time. This new paradigm for space prioritizes the security and economic activities that occur within space itself not just those they enable on Earth.

Space is on the cusp of a major transition from exploration to security and commerce

The phased development of space. Space is no longer the exclusive domain of scientific exploration and discovery. As with all new domains space is undergoing a transition from one phase to another which raises new questions about the ways activity in space will be defined in the future and who will define it. Space is transitioning from a phase of “discovery” to phases of “security” and “commerce.” These next phases will be defined by an explosion of commercial activity and security operations necessary to protect that activity safeguard access and maneuverability prevent malign actions and pave the way for more routinized space activity. The time is rapidly approaching when space’s value to security on Earth will be matched by the need to secure the economic activity occurring within Earth orbit. Even as commercial concerns begin to dominate Earth orbit in the short term over the next thirty years the frontier of economic activity in space will likely expand to encompass cislunar space the spherical area formed by the radius between the Earth and the Moon. To bridge this phased transition in space the United States in concert with its allies and partners must set forth a framework to protect sovereignty and property in space.

An explosion of space actors. Unlike the 1960s space race space is no longer a domain in which few nation-states operate. Over the past several decades there has been an explosion of actors with activities and interests in space that will continue to define its trajectory. While the United States still leads in space by many measures including its share of global space investments and numbers of satellites in orbit there are a far greater number of countries operating in space today. Russia China the European Union Japan and India have all deployed their own global or regional satellite navigation networks comparable to the US Global Positioning System (GPS). A legion of smaller national players—from Luxembourg to New Zealand to the United Arab Emirates—are playing in the arenas of space commerce exploration and security. Multipolarity in space presents a range of challenges and opportunities for the United States to achieve security and prosperity in space.

Figure 2: An explosion of nations in space

Space has seen a proliferation of actors since nations first began launching space-related agencies and programs in the mid-1950s

Commerce as a driver of activity. Nation-states are far from the only entities operating in space. Corporations have been making money in Earth orbit for half a century and will continue to lead innovation in space creating opportunities and challenges for governments. New technology and business revolutions—in microelectronics telecommunications and space launch—have made a compelling business case for commercial firms to conduct missions in low Earth orbit (LEO) that had traditionally been situated in geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO). The result of this trend—massive constellations of small satellites—will upend the commercial space business and transform the global communication industry. Indeed while traditional advances in defense technologies (like ballistic missiles) have driven space commerce and exploration in the past it is increasingly commercial developments (like on-orbit satellite servicing) that are driving defense capabilities and concerns going forward.

Security in space is at risk and the United States must act urgently

The security (ad)vantage point of space. From a security perspective there is an urgent need for the United States and its allies and partners to shape the future trajectory of space. In many ways space is the ultimate “high ground” as it contains key “terrain” that is very advantageous for surveillance warfighting and rapidly expanding commercial uses. This high ground is becoming more and more useful for nations—including the United States and its allies and partners as well as competitors like China and Russia. Securing this high ground over the coming decades is imperative for spacefaring nations to gain and maintain an advantageous position.

The return of great-power competition. Increased competition among the United States China and Russia on Earth further complicates the security picture in space. Great-power competitors may find themselves in a struggle for space resources and this high ground. The winners of this struggle will likely be those nations that can establish a generally accepted space framework which is why the United States must urgently seek to shape this framework. How nations interact; develop space capabilities; and advance future tactical operational and strategic plans will shape the future trajectory of space. If great-power competitors are unable to agree on key space norms rules and frameworks a long-term struggle for space superiority may escalate into tension and potentially even boil over into warfare. The authors of this report lay out a strategic plan to not only prevent a space catastrophe from occurring but to encourage dialogue and planning to unlock new opportunities and innovation. The United States should lead now to shape the rules of the road for space and ensure favorable frameworks are developed and adhered to otherwise these rules will be written for it. To realize this potential it is imperative that policymakers act now and in accordance with a long-term strategy.

Risk of disruption and denial of space activity and access. Since the 1990s the United States’ expeditionary model of warfare has relied on space capabilities for both tactical and strategic intelligence missile-launch warning and communication. Meanwhile China and Russia are fielding increasingly sophisticated counterspace weapons capable of disrupting denying or destroying US and allied space assets in conflict or crisis. The saliency of denying space access is likely to increase in great-power competition. The vulnerability of space systems to lower-cost cyberattack means that other smaller competitors could also achieve counterspace effects. The creation of the Russian Aerospace Forces (2015) the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force (2015) and the US Space Force (2019) all point to competitors perceiving space as a warfighting domain.

New frontiers of exploration require shaping

The edge of humanity’s routine activity in space is moving beyond GEO to encompass cislunar space the sphere formed by the Earth-Moon radius. This opens new opportunities and risks that any future strategy must come to grips with. As the United States continues to plan a crewed lunar landing in the 2020s commercial firms are racing to support exploration efforts (and even resource extraction) on the Moon. At the Lagrange points—areas of particular orbital stability in the Earth-Moon system—nation-states are deploying satellites for research and increasingly military reconnaissance. The Lagrange points (and other advantageous orbital regions) may become contested as nations seek to observe and operate in cislunar space and activity there will become all the more important in the coming decades.

Strategic approach

These developments—today and through 2050—demand a new US approach to space. This Atlantic Council Strategy Paper offers space foreign policy and national security policymakers a roadmap for navigating this new space age.

Space is in desperate need of a long-term strategy

Given the pace of major trends a short-term strategy for space is insufficient. While the 2020 US National Space Policy and 2018 US National Space Strategy helpfully identified principles goals and guidelines for US space activity a longer-term lens is needed. This strategy does not profess to predict or anticipate all changes that may occur in space over the next three decades but its ambitious timeframe is deliberate to raise questions and encourage the long-term strategic vision necessary. It is imperative for the United States and its allies to get out ahead and shape the future of space in ways favorable to them. This paper proposes the United States takes a phased approach to implementing a long-term strategy including milestones in the short medium and long term to achieve security and prosperity in space and on Earth (enabled by space). Thinking strategically will help shape the context in which novel technologies and activities are introduced even if specific technological advancements are largely unpredictable in the thirty-year time horizon. Any strategy that is implemented should be updated over time and will require regular reevaluation of goals and policies. The United States in concert with its allies and partners has the opportunity now to shape the future of space over the next thirty years if it takes action today.

The importance of allies and partners

Realizing the full potential of space requires that the United States work with many spacefaring nations including existing allies and new partners and in some instances with competitors. This strategy seeks to set forth a future for space that is free secure and prosperous. But this strategy prepares for the eventuality that some nation-states may harbor malignant intent. It will be critical to monitor the space strategy and policy of US competitors—which are sure to evolve in the timeframe of this strategy—to determine where cooperation is possible and where competition is necessary.

The strategy

Vision and strategic goals

The vision of this strategy is to ensure the space domain remains harmonious fully accessible organized and regulated. This will allow humankind to reap the benefits of space resources in perpetuity. The key goals of this strategy are to:

promote stability harmony and freedoms among space actors by establishing a rules-based order for space;

deter hostile action and secure US and allied space assets access to and freedom of navigation within the global commons of space; and

foster US and global prosperity through the continued expansion of space commerce.

A blueprint for securing space by 2050

This strategy paper provides the following blueprint for the United States and its allies and partners to take to secure space in the long term. It includes the following four steps each of which is elaborated below:

provide guidelines for space governance laying out “rules of the road” for safe and secure operations in space; defend space access from those nation-states—particularly great-power competitors—which would seek to deny it; accelerate space commerce critical for space development through clear regulation and targeted investments; and intentionally push the envelope of security and commercial activity to embrace cislunar space—the area between the Earth and the Moon.

Principal recommendations

To accomplish these goals the strategy recommends graduated actions to be taken in the short (2021-2025) medium (2025-2040) and long (2040-2050) term. Over the three-decade time period this strategy calls for the United States to:

1. Update and refine the legal and regulatory frameworks governing space. The international law of space centered on the 1967 Outer Space Treaty is outdated and insufficient for a future of space in which economic activity is primary. The international community needs a new foundational space treaty and the United States should precipitate its negotiation. Moreover the United States needs to update its domestic governance of space such as ensuring that each administration uses the National Space Council an executive body to coordinate government-wide space activity as well as empowering the council to deliver a thirty-year strategy for space.

i. In the short term the US president should appoint and the State Department should staff the office of a special presidential envoy for space. The US special presidential envoy for space should then energize the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs to socialize norms for responsible space behavior which should include US allies competitors and industry in laying a foundation for a comprehensive space order.

ii. In the short term the United States should also reform space administration. The Biden administration should form a National Space Council immediately ideally chaired by the vice president which should be charged with developing and overseeing the implementation and regular reevaluation of a thirty-year space strategy. The administration and Congress should collaborate on legislation to ensure each administration utilizes and staffs the National Space Council. The Congress should monitor the newly formed US Space Force and in due time mandate a study of whether an independent Department of the Space Force is warranted.

iii. In the medium term the United States should lead the international community in either extending the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) area of responsibility to space or creating an ICAO-like organization for space activity. Doing so can begin laying the foundations for customary international law favorable to security and prosperity in space prior to replacing the 1967 accord. Even in the long term international space governance must remain flexible to an evolving space domain in which development will be ever changing.

iv. In the long term spacefaring nations should construct a modern internationally agreed-upon order and “rules of the road” for behavior in space. Advancing space technology is outpacing existing rules and the absence of space law invites excessive uncertainty and instability. The following steps should be taken prior to establishing a new space treaty. 2. Establish a collective security alliance for space. To deter aggression in space the United States should form a new space security alliance including likeminded spacefaring nations to establish collective security in space.

i. In the short term the United States should engage its existing allies in discussions to gain common understandings of space security and take part in coordinated allied activities in space and space-adjacent capabilities to enhance allied credibility on space security.

ii. In the medium term the United States can activate existing alliances to build international consensus on the protection of space-related assets and develop a shared understanding of the importance of defending key resources and access and the need for an alliance to establish collective security in space.

iii. In the long term the United States should lead the establishment of a space security alliance. 3. Accelerate space commerce through clear regulation and targeted investment. The United States should identify and invest in keystone space technologies—those capabilities with positive externalities to the entire space industrial base. In doing so the United States and likeminded governments can accelerate private-sector use of Earth orbit in the short term while developing cislunar space toward the end of the thirty-year period.

i. In the short term through public-private partnerships and by leveraging its considerable research-and-development budget the US government should promote the development of keystone space technologies. Those technologies enable a range of missions in space at affordable cost in the short term including technologies for launch communications and in-situ resource utilization (ISRU).

ii. In the medium term the United States should involve allied and US subnational governments and leadership in space organization and infrastructure. At a federal level the government should provide grants and other incentives to encourage state local tribal and territorial governments to participate in the space economy through research grants for state universities the lease of state public lands for space ports and building infrastructure for space launch. This may be a valuable way to increase revenue streams for remote localities leading to increased local prosperity. Further the United States should work to negotiate access to space ports in foreign countries.

iii. In the medium term an appropriately utilized and staffed National Space Council at the Cabinet level can avoid redundant commercial regulation across executive agencies. The National Space Council should incorporate industry perspectives in a structural fashion.

iv. In the long term enhancing private-public partnerships in space will enable the United States to maintain and expand its technological edge in space including in the crucial area of diversifying space launch platforms and employing ISRU on the Moon and beyond. 4. Take a cislunar approach to space development. This strategy seeks to expand nations’ access first to Earth’s orbit and eventually to cislunar space which together will host an increasingly large fraction of the global economy over the next thirty years. This cislunar approach to space will involve the routinization of space activity in cislunar space over the next thirty years to an extent similar to how activity in LEO is unremarkable today.

i. In the short term US exploration of the Moon and Mars via the Artemis program provides a number of avenues for increasing security uses of cislunar space.

ii. In the medium term as commercial activity in Earth orbit becomes ever more routine US civil and military entities should push the envelope of regular space activity into cislunar space the area between the edge of where most current satellites orbit and the Moon and similarly advantageous areas identified in the solar system.

iii. In the long term the United States should seek to build infrastructure at the Lagrange points critical strategic geography within cislunar space in service of a “Cislunar Economy” that will eventually rival today’s “LEO Economy.” Given China’s planned activities on the Moon—including the planned establishment of a permanent base on the water-rich lunar south pole—increased attention in this region of space is crucial.

I. Strategic context

Space in 2050 will look vastly different from space today. Over the next decade alone the number of satellites could quintuple as government and industry entities launch various missions. While such proliferation of activity will enhance space-based capabilities enabling universal Internet access and enhancing Earth-observation and data-collection capabilities it also risks further space debris triggering an unstoppable chain of collisions. Space is currently undergoing a paradigm shift as commercial entities are developing and fielding the technologies that are the key drivers of space utilization. Indeed inventive space companies are expanding the concept of what is possible in space eyeing space tourism in the near future and simultaneously growing the space economy to what could be a trillion-dollar enterprise by 2040. In the long term commercial and state entities will see novel levels of cislunar activity requiring ISRU and onsite three-dimensional (3D) manufacturing to keep pace with space activity. Indeed spaceflight could underpin resiliency on Earth opening access to space-based energy and material resources. Yet with the realization of such value in the space domain the future may see an increased use of space by militaries including great-power competitors China and Russia. China is racing to develop capacity for its own permanent space station cislunar supremacy and deep-space exploration within the next thirty years. Despite the expansive future of space the current space framework is rooted in the past. The future is just around the corner and protecting space will cultivate innovation wealth and security to the benefit of all humanity.

To achieve security and prosperity in space—just as in any domain—national efforts must progress through three phases:

Discovery The first phase is scientific and requires civil agencies (like the National Aeronautics and Space Agency [NASA]) to engage in missions of exploration setting the parameters for the new domain and establishing sources of value. Security The second phase security requires administrative and defense bodies (like the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] and US Space Force) to provide the public goods of security and freedom of navigation in the domain. Commerce The third phase is commercial where private-sector entities (like the many commercial space firms operating today) build an economy around the new domain justifying the national investments made in the first two phases.

Today space and Earth’s orbit specifically is on the cusp of transitioning from phase two to phase three with commercial entities eager to leverage space for private business ends. Within thirty years the frontier of space commercialization will likely expand from the edge of GEO to cislunar space. However with the regulation and security of space not yet well established the world risks a new Wild West or Scramble for Space.

Generally this bold strategy for space assumes that the future strategic environment will be distinct and in ways unpredictably so from the present strategic environment. Specifically this strategy assumes that the primary driver for space security will be space commerce that strong alliances will prove just as relevant (or even more relevant) to space activity as to Earth-based activity and that the strategic geography of space—key access points and orbits—will be become even more critical and contested. This strategy paper attempts to identify primary areas that need improved norms regulation and laws. It is impossible to identify all issues in space that will emerge over the next three decades. However the positions offices and bodies that this strategy paper proposes will be well positioned to take on these challenges in due time.

Routinization of Earth orbit

Rather than being exceptional it is becoming routine that major countries find that their national security and economic interests extend to space. Indeed the days are numbered that Earth orbit will be considered more a part of outer space than an integral part of Earth’s economic political and social structures. Because activity in Earth orbit is becoming so routine and is proceeding at an increasing pace questions of space sustainability and the consequences of debris in Earth orbit are coming to the fore.

Small- and medium-sized countries are fielding research intelligence and communications assets in Earth orbit. Major powers are gearing up their militaries to increase space situational awareness defend their space assets and exercise space control. Smaller countries are betting the future of their economies on space commerce. Commercial entities are preparing to develop entirely new lines of business in orbit. The simultaneous increase in the space economy and the degrading space security environment may touch off a “space rush.”

The space rush of the 2020s differs from the space race of the 1950s and 1960s when the United States and the Soviet Union dominated space exploration and development. Today more than eighty national space programs around the globe have entered the space rush contributing to space advancements while increasing space congestion. Spacefaring nations along with non-state space entities are partaking in the competition to seize upon vast opportunities ranging from commercial wealth to military dominance.

Who controls low-earth orbit controls near-Earth space. Who controls near-Earth space dominates Terra. Who dominates Terra determines the destiny of humankind.

Great-power competition

Competition among the great powers—the United States China and Russia—is the defining feature of international security on Earth as it is in space.

United States The United States relies on space to enable its expeditionary way of war and perceives growing threats to its ability to rely on space in high-end conflict. China and Russia according to the US 2020 Defense Space Strategy “present the greatest strategic threat due to their development testing and deployment of counter space capabilities and their associated military doctrine for employment in conflict extending to space.” Committed to preparing to deter and prevail in conflicts in space the United States established the US Space Force in 2019 as its first new military service since 1947. China China sees space as a commanding height in modern warfare one which is an asymmetric vulnerability for the United States and one which is thoroughly integrated with the cyber and electromagnetic domains. In 2015 a major reorganization of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) regrouped various elements of the PLA into a service-like Strategic Support Force (SSF) which included cyber electromagnetic and space warfare branches. This reorganization coincided with the PLA’s adoption of “winning informationized local wars” as its military strategy highlighting the importance of controlling space. Russia The Russian Federation regards control of aerospace as essential to its national security and strategic deterrence. Russia has revived from its Soviet past perhaps the world’s most sophisticated arsenal of anti-satellite weapons including direct-ascent co-orbital and directed energy modes. Russia’s space doctrine—defending from space threats by holding space assets at risk—is reflected in its military organization and diplomacy. Russia reorganized its military forces in 2015 to place its air forces space forces and air and missile defense forces under one service the Aerospace Forces.

More states in space

Paraguay New Zealand Luxembourg and the United Arab Emirates offer four examples of how governments are seizing upon emerging opportunities.

Paraguay The Paraguay Space Agency established in 2014 pursues strategic partnerships for both capacity building and technology transfer such as collaborating with India for resource mapping remote sensing for agriculture and satellite manufacture and launch. The Paraguay Space Agency’s partnership with India is notable given the prevalence of Chinese investment in Latin American space programs. New Zealand With the establishment of the New Zealand Space Agency in 2016 New Zealand opened its “front door” for space activity. New Zealand’s first foray into space is a methane-emission satellite mission. New Zealand’s membership in Five Eyes (an intelligence-sharing group that also includes the United States United Kingdom Australia and Canada) means that the United States may be able to work with this ally in space security missions in the future.

Luxembourg In the twenty-first century Luxembourg has reinvented itself again as a hub of an emerging space economy creating a positive regulatory legal research and business environment. Indeed Luxembourg was the first country in Europe to adopt domestic legislation that regulated property rights for resources returned from space which may serve as a precursor for similar legislation in other nations. United Arab Emirates In February 2021 the United Arab Emirates inserted the Hope probe into Martian orbit for an exploratory mission—an accomplishment as the UAE’s space program is only the seventh to ever do so.

Space sustainability

Satellites are critical for security and prosperity but they are also delicate expensive hardware subject to damage in the harsh environment of space by small pieces of debris. Because objects in space travel so fast a bus-sized satellite can be destroyed by an object the size of a marble and critically damaged by a fleck of paint. This vulnerability makes space debris of vital importance. Due to a range of factors—the proliferation of smaller satellites in LEO counterspace weapons tests and collisions in space—the amount of space debris has become extensive.

Space-surveillance networks regularly track and catalogue more than twenty-eight thousand debris objects.

There exists a tipping point where the quantity of debris is great enough that entire orbital bands become unusable. In 1978 NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler proposed a theory that debris-driven collisions can become self-perpetuating making space access impossible. This runaway effect is known as the “Kessler Syndrome.” As the density of objects in LEO increases so does the number of collisions producing more debris fragments. The larger number of debris fragments subsequently increases the number of collisions producing yet more debris in a vicious cycle.

To protect operating satellites and preserve space sustainability space situational awareness (SSA) and space traffic management (STM) are vital missions. While these two areas have some overlap they have notable differences and should be addressed separately.

Space situational awareness (SSA) SSA is “comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the space and terrestrial environment…that enables timely relevant decision-quality and accurate assessments in order to successfully protect space assets.” Space traffic management (STM) STM is “the set of technical and regulatory provisions for promoting safe access into outer space operations in outer space and return from outer space to Earth.”

In sum commerce and security activity in Earth’s orbit are an unexceptional part of the global economy and international relations. This routinization has consequences for the space environment and threatens to significantly interfere with satellite operations in the coming decades. Plenty of pressing issues remain in Earth orbit among them the evolution of commercial and defense technology the role of the private sector and access to critical materials for space systems. But beyond Earth orbit a thirty-year strategy needs to consider the next frontier—cislunar space.

The promise of cislunar space

Human economic and security activity in the space domain is already beginning to extend beyond Earth orbit and will within the timeframe of this strategy encompass cislunar space. The sphere created by the Earth-Moon radius cislunar space offers the chance to extend activities beyond GEO with the possibility of scientific and military observation military sensing and communication and resource extraction. Cislunar space is particularly attractive as it offers three elements essential to human space activity: energy materials and integrated intelligence. Without these three convergent streams space-mission success is obstructed. Cislunar space provides all three of these assets simultaneously and is positioned relatively close to the Earth. With Earth only about 1.35 light seconds from the Moon cislunar space offers a platform wherein Earth-based communications can control missions in real time. Additionally because the Moon sits in a shallow gravity well compared to Earth space vehicles can more easily propel from points in cislunar space. Thus cislunar space offers a viable point for kickstarting exploration beyond Earth orbit.

Within the vast expanse of cislunar space there is important strategic geography that could become areas of tension including the Earth-Moon Lagrange points.

What are Lagrange points? The Earth-Moon Lagrange points are the gateways of cislunar space. Lagrange points are regions in space where the gravitational forces of two celestial bodies (such as the Sun and the Earth or the Moon and the Earth) produce regions of enhanced orbital stability. These points are already attracting scientific missions and will likely host security and economic activity as phases of space development evolve. Even as initial deployments to the Lagrange points take place spacefaring entities are building on an unstable scaffolding. The Lagrange points are unregulated and present the risk of a tragedy of the commons should government or commercial activity accelerate before a regulatory framework is established. The security of Lagrange points will be essential to maintaining and expanding US and allied interests in space. Putting a spacecraft at (or in a “halo” orbit around) a Lagrange point allows it to stay in a fixed position relative to a celestial body. Thus spacecraft placed at Lagrange points consume far less station-keeping fuel reducing costs and enhancing longevity. There are five Lagrange points numbered L1 through L5 in any orbital system and while there are plenty of uses of the Earth-Sun system this paper concerns itself with the Earth-Moon Lagrange points. Lagrange points are a vital piece of space “real estate”; although space is large a hostile power could dominate a Lagrange point and exclude other nations from accessing it.

Today exotic orbits like these are consigned to the pages of astrophysics journals and conferences. But in decades’ time they could be the front-page concern of defense analysts and national security policymakers. Today satellite placement in GEO is tightly regulated by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) a United Nations (UN) specialized agency so that satellites in GEO do not interfere with each other. Without future regulation specialized orbits in cislunar space may suffer from a tragedy of the commons where individual satellite operators have no incentive to deconflict with each other.

While Earth orbit and cislunar space will be the critical theaters of space strategy two cross-cutting issues will impact the development of these space domains: the employment of emerging technology in space applications and the increasing role of the private sector in space activity.

Commercial and defense technology

The strategic space environment will be shaped by emerging technology developments which enable more sophisticated satellite networks enhance Earth observation and reduce costs while effectively broadening access to space. These technologies will enable a range of new commercial and military space missions and applications.

Communications satellites Communication is a core mission of space systems with new communications technology facilitating more sophisticated satellite constellations. Among other benefits communications satellites in GEO are responsible for television broadcasting meteorology radio and military satellite communication.



While satellites in GEO are enormously useful space commerce is shifting to LEO. LEO has two key advantages: proximity to Earth and revisit frequency. The smallsat revolution (the continued miniaturization of satellites) decreased launch costs and compelling new business cases have combined to make massive constellations in LEO possible that take advantage of LEO benefits. Laser technology Laser technology is on the cusp of enhancing satellite communications through higher data-transfer rates and enhanced security. Currently data transmitted using radio waves carry a number of disadvantages. As radio waves propagate the signal transmitted “grows weaker due to noise disruption or the sheer volume of space.” As activities move farther into space latency issues will create unacceptable delays for some applications. Lasers by contrast maintain signal strength over longer distances and employ shorter wavelengths allowing exponentially faster data transfer. While the radio spectrum is tightly controlled in space limiting room for innovation there is more regulatory room to experiment with communication lasers. Laser technology can advance LEO satellite connectivity as well as deep-space communications.

Imaging sensors For years defense and commercial satellites have employed electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) cameras which aim to image targets by creating a contrast between the desired target and its background. While defense and commercial satellites have employed EO/IR cameras such systems encounter limitations in tracking objects at a distance especially under adverse conditions. While modern EO/IR sensors are degraded by cloud cover heavy moisture and low light synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is always available regardless of conditions. SAR can produce either two-dimensional (2D) or elevation maps which are useful for defense and civilian applications. As such SAR imagery improves orbital detection. Through 2050 SAR resolutions and applications are expected to expand and proliferate. Reusable space launch Reusable space launch has revolutionized the space industry by reducing cost to orbit a longtime limiting factor for military and commercial space applications. While previously capsules or other components would only be used a single time innovations have allowed scientists to retrieve and reuse launch components substantially reducing cost. Reusable launch vehicles have transported commercial satellites national security payloads and even human astronauts in just the past year.

The space environment is characterized by increasingly capable kinetic and non-kinetic anti-satellite weapons. With the expanding value of space these weapons will become increasingly salient as the threat of space conflict grows.

Anti-satellite weapons (ASATs) The United States began testing direct-ascent anti-satellite weapons (DA-ASATs) in 1959 eventually destroying a solar observation satellite in 1985 with the ASM-135 missile. DA-ASATs have ground-to-space capabilities with a terrestrial launch that targets space-based infrastructure. Currently the United States possesses several ballistic-missile-defense (BMD) interceptors which function as latent kinetic ASATs. These BMD systems include the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) the Aegis-based SM-3 and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD). While these systems are designed as BMD any exoatmospheric BMD has an inherent latent ASAT capability. Indeed the technical requirements for hitting a satellite are no more challenging than hitting a missile so a nation with strong missile-defense prowess can be said to have an ASAT capability. However as of now the United States has prioritized DA-ASATs to a lesser extent than China or Russia and arms-control proposals by those nations reflect that. Proposals such as the Treaty on Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space and of the Threat or Use of Force Against Outer Space Objects (PPWT) pushed by China and Russia focus on space-to-space or space-to-ground weapons placed in space; this notably excludes ground-to-space weapons like DA-ASAT capabilities. In 1968 the Soviet Union successfully demonstrated an anti-satellite weapon. In 2018 a Russian MiG-31 fighter jet was photographed with a possible air-launched ASAT. Russia’s S-400 surface-to-air missile system can range to LEO satellites but may not be accurate enough to target them. In 2007 China conducted its first successful kinetic ASAT test destroying an aging Chinese meteorological satellite with an SC-19 missile. This test which came with no warning and produced a dangerous quantity of debris violated international norms and brought China widespread criticism. China has not conducted any additional debris-producing ASAT testing since but intelligence analysts believe that China has conducted several non-impact related kinetic trajectory tests which could reach GEO satellites with its DN-2 and DN-3 interceptors. In 2019 India became the fourth country to successfully test a kinetic ASAT weapon which was employed against a small target satellite in LEO over the Bay of Bengal. While India is a promising partner of the United States US officials condemned this test for potentially endangering the International Space Station. Other nations such as North Korea and Iran have continued to expand their ballistic-missile programs. While direct-ascent kinetic ASATs are of concern both Russia and China are experimenting with co-orbital ASATs and non-kinetic orbital assets to compromise or destroy US and allied satellites. A co-orbital ASAT is an object that stationed in orbit can change its orbit rapidly and collide with or otherwise disable (e.g. with a robotic arm) another satellite. Unlike ground-to-space DA-ASAT technologies co-orbital ASATs are space to space with satellites targeting other objects in orbit. Non-kinetic weapons In addition to kinetic ASATs various countries have developed counterspace cyber capabilities. The cyber threat to space assets ranges from theft or alteration of information to destruction of satellites or their supporting components. Cyberattacks directly target data and data systems exploiting links between satellites and from satellites to ground stations. Since cyberattacks are less likely to produce debris when rendering a satellite inoperable they may function as a “soft-kill” capability. As such nations may perceive cyberattacks on space assets as less escalatory and therefore view cyberweapons as more usable than debris-producing hard-kill alternatives. Directed-energy weapons (DEWs) pose an increasingly viable threat to space-based assets. Directed-energy weapons primarily operate by blinding jamming or damaging sensors or circuits rendering a satellite inoperable. DEWs operate at different thresholds—they can dazzle (temporarily blinding the optical sensor of a satellite) disable (rendering the satellite itself temporarily inoperable) or destroy (permanently destroying the satellite itself) with varying energy requirements across that spectrum. Directed-energy threats include lasers high-power microwaves and other types of radiofrequency weapons. Through fake transmissions or spoofing radiofrequency weapons can interrupt satellite connections and thus achieve similar ends as do cyber means. Electronic warfare (EW) will present a major and evolving threat to space-based positioning navigation and timing (PNT) assets and the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in the timeframe of this strategy. EW includes radiofrequency (RF) jamming and GPS spoofing. These techniques have been used in terrestrial warfare for decades so it is no surprise that this practice is expanding to space. One space-distinct EW application is uplink and downlink jamming. Although usually temporary jamming technology has the ability to seriously inhibit or block various space-based technologies on which modern economies and global militaries rely such as GPS satellite communications (SATCOM) and SAR imaging.

Private-sector engagement

While private firms have been making money in space for more than fifty years the lion’s share of commercial activity in space has been about enabling activity on Earth—including transmission of radio and television signals and Earth observation. These activities remain important and have enormous potential for growth in the coming decades. Yet there is a new wave of space commerce coming that implicates activity within space—mining manufacturing and tourism. This new category of space commerce has the potential to move the space domain into a commercial phase distinct from the scientific and security concerns that have previously dominated. As this transition occurs the United States will have to interact with the private sector—already a crucial element of space strategy—in a different manner to foster discovery and innovation while guarding against exploitation that could prove detrimental to sustainable space development.

The private sector is and will remain a key element in the success of US and allied space programs. Especially since NASA ended the Space Shuttle program space programs have relied less on governments and more on private industry as evidenced by the burgeoning US commercial space industry. A decade after the first commercial launch of a satellite to LEO in 2009 the space industry has accelerated with more than $25.7 billion of private investment globally. Despite this importance private-sector space entities sometimes face challenges in interacting with the US government. These obstacles include a complex regulatory and compliance environment that can be slow moving risk averse and process based rather than outcome oriented.

II. Key goals for US security strategy in space

Currently given the widespread reliance on space for a variety of civilian and military applications space is increasingly “competitive congested and contested.” In the coming thirty years the United States and likeminded nations should nurture a thriving self-sustaining economy in space. Further as the space domain transitions away from a phase of development primarily characterized by exploration the United States must lead in establishing a security order that enables this space economy and pushes the envelope of human economic activity beyond GEO and into cislunar space. To do so the United States in concert with its allies and partners should work to provide the common goods of sovereignty and property rights in space. Accordingly this long-term space strategy prioritizes the following three goals: build an international rules-based order for space; deter hostile action and secure space assets and access; and foster US and global prosperity through the continued expansion of space commerce.

III. Major elements of the strategy

Earth orbit is on the edge of a transition from being primarily the remit of exploration and security to being the locus of a thriving economy. In the next thirty years human economic and security activity is likely to push this envelope further embracing cislunar space. This transition must be built upon a solid regulatory security technological framework and human capital base.

In order to achieve a rules-based order in space preserve the US and allied space security advantage and advance technology for space development the United States—in coordination with its allies and partners—should prioritize new space law a new space security alliance advanced space technology and a cislunar approach to space as the major elements of US national strategy for space over the next thirty years.

Major spacefaring entities are increasingly disregarding the existing space treaties or interpreting them in increasingly expansive ways to justify their activities in space. In the long term (2040-2050) the United States should seek to develop a new foundational space treaty. Because international agreements of this sort can take years if not decades to negotiate in the short term (2021-2025) the United States should seek to develop customary international law that matches US and allied norms for space and to forge consensus among likeminded nations about the need to develop a new treaty on the international law of space.

Short term (2021-2025) The United States begins socializing key elements of a new space treaty to set the scene for diplomatic negotiations.



US government negotiates bilateral and multilateral agreements similar to the 2015 SPACE Act to influence the development of international space law. The United States achieves buy-in from likeminded nations on core principles of space exploration security and commerce.



US and allied governments decide to extend the ICAO area of responsibility or create an ICAO-like organization to monitor space activity.



US and likeminded governments align orbital-debris mitigation standards.



The United States works to create a formalized system to exchange SSA within the international community. Medium term (2025-2040) Long term (2040-2050) The United States seeks widespread accession to a new foundational treaty for outer space activity.

Purpose of a new foundational space treaty • Guarantee freedom of navigation and exploration in space. Freedom of navigation can be accomplished only through expeditionary space security; limited weaponization in space and the extension of military intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR); and civilian and military communications infrastructure and capabilities throughout outer space in planetary orbits and on celestial bodies. • Continue the Outer Space Treaty’s provisions that prohibit the placement or use of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in space. As such even a future international legal framework that loosens restrictions on conventional weapons in space should preserve nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The objective from the 1967 treaty of preserving inclusivity and peaceful uses of space should be cemented as well. However this legal framework must remain pragmatic to the requirement of space security and defense of peaceful use and access from malign actors. • Address space sustainability. To do so the treaty should contain provisions that account for orbital-debris mitigation and removal. Indeed the need for this provision is likely to increase dramatically by 2050 as the pace of space launch only increases and protection of Earth’s biosphere requires further attention. • Contain the same ideal of non-appropriation of entire celestial bodies as in the 1967 Treaty (that prohibits the establishment of sovereignty over the Moon or any other celestial bodies) but it ought to be clarified so as not to interfere with the placement of peaceful installations on these bodies or prohibit resource extraction. Moreover the 1967 treaty was correct to rule out appropriation of celestial bodies but this new treaty must go further by prohibiting the seizure and exclusion of important orbital zones such as the Lagrange points while allowing for legitimate safety zones.

Establish a space security alliance

The United States and its allies must create a framework for cooperation and mutual security in space by forming an international space security alliance and extending the reach of existing alliances like NATO—appropriate for the twenty-first century and beyond—to ensure collective security and deter aggression in space. As described earlier in the paper over the next thirty years great-power competition is likely to impact activity in space and space may well be used by the United States’ strategic competitors to achieve broader security goals on Earth. As space activity increases Earth-based activities enabled by space will multiply over time and space-based activities will have greater potential impact on security on Earth itself. As a result the securitization of space will become an increasingly important focus and the establishment and maintenance of collective security among likeminded nations will be important in the long term (2040-2050). To reach this in the short (2021-2025) and medium terms (2025-2040) the United States should focus on arriving at common understandings of space security with allies and partners and on engaging in coordinated activities in space.

Short term (2021-2025) United States prioritizes a common understanding of the space security environment and builds capacity.



The United States comes to common understandings with allies and partners about mutual interests in space. United States works with NATO and likeminded partners to develop an ambitious set of aligned activities for cooperation in space.



The United States undertakes multilateral and bilateral diplomatic efforts with European and Indo-Pacific allies and partners to socialize the need for a space alliance in the long term. Medium term (2025-2040) Long term (2040-2050) The United States its existing allies and new partners commit themselves to a space security Alliance which pledges collective security and mutual defense from attacks in the space domain.

Purpose of a space security alliance This space security alliance should promote cooperation among allies and partners and establish and guarantee collective security. A key first task for the alliance will be to devise a tailored strategy building on this thirty-year strategy for space to counter hostile action and guarantee safe access and passage free from malign interference in space. A space security alliance should deter countries known to be undermining collective access and security in space—or those nations that have actions in and goals for space that are not entirely known. This strategy must be flexible enough to keep up with rapidly advancing technology and establish rules of the road for conduct and cooperation in space deterring adversarial action that jeopardizes the space commons. While the United States and its allies will always reserve the right to defend themselves they must identify ways to extend their long history of working with competitors when appropriate. Even competitors of the United States recognize that the space domain is so dynamic diverse critical to advancing humanity and interconnected that one entity could not possibly act alone to secure space. In the years ahead the United States and its allies and partners will need to walk a difficult line between all-out competition with near-peers like China and Russia and cooperation on issues including addressing the climate crisis reforming the world health system in the wake of COVID-19 and realigning international trade. Enhanced cooperation in space—whether it be research dealing with space debris or deconflicting satellite orbits—may be one avenue to improving overall relations. While it is foolish to think of space exclusively as a domain of peaceful cooperation it is equally unhelpful to emphasize only competition in space.

Facilitate the business of space technology

To facilitate the transition to an orbital economy in the long term (2040-2050) and maximize space-based services to Earth in the short term (2021-2025) the US government should invest in space launch satellite-constellation operations upgraded space power and propellants on-orbit services and ISRU; prepare for rocket transportation; develop innovative ways of harnessing the private sector; and secure supply chains critical to the manufacture of space components. It is difficult if not impossible to predict which technologies will be critical in thirty years’ time. To account for the nonlinear nature of technological development this strategy recommends investing in some specific technologies to push the envelope of space development in the short term and engaging in reforms to government practices that will encourage the development of space technology throughout the thirty-year timeframe of this strategy.

Short term (2021-2025) The United States increases national investment in research and development specifically to ensure emerging space developments are leveraged for US and allied interests.



US government reviews existing acquisition policies and regulations that hinder public-private cooperation and space technology advancement.



US officials carefully monitor critical supply chains for critical space components. US government undertakes efforts to regulate rocket launch and build landing infrastructure.



The United States works with key allies and partners notably in Europe and Asia to build space ports in allied countries. Medium term (2025-2040) Long term (2040-2050) The national security space community reevaluates which technologies should be prioritized for investment in coordination with industry and academia.



The United States and its allies develop disaggregated multidomain and mobile launch platforms.

Take a cislunar approach to space

To achieve long-term security and prosperity in space the United States should emphasize the development of cislunar space the sphere formed by the Earth-Moon radius.

While the Lagrange points offer one attractive orbit in cislunar space that is obvious to strategists in 2020 there is a potential for other orbital “real estate” in cislunar space to become contested over the next thirty years. Furthermore similarly advantageous zones of the solar system may be reached and their potential realized in the coming decades. For example the moons of planets like Mars Jupiter and Saturn and other bodies in space such as the planetoid Ceres and asteroids provide fertile ground for mining operations. Securing cislunar space will provide a critical trial in protecting these valuable zones for sustainable space exploration. By working to wisely and proactively manage the Lagrange points the United States can set the international standard for constructive resolution of future debates in cislunar space and beyond.

Short term (2021-2025) NASA evaluates the Artemis program and adjusts benchmarks for its space exploration program if needed prioritizing a deep-space exploration program. The United States considers the implications of military satellites and SSA for the routinization of cislunar space. Medium term (2025-2040) Long term (2040-2050) NASA develops infrastructure at the Lagrange points while US diplomats negotiate an international framework to regulate the use of cislunar space.



The United States and likeminded nations build out a presence at the Lagrange points to eventually transition to commercial operators.

IV. Guidelines for implementation

In pursuit of the goals of this strategy US policymakers should coordinate with allies and partners to execute the major elements of this strategy using the following guidelines for implementation. Policymakers must weigh these recommendations with potential drawbacks and alternatives.

1. Space law and policy To facilitate space commerce and the sustainability of such activity by guaranteeing sovereignty and property rights in space the United States must work to implement new treaties laws frameworks and organizations governing space from the international to the subnational levels. 2. Space security alliance To demonstrate the US commitment to space-related security the president of the United States should direct the US Space Council to create a plan to develop a space security alliance. The alliance’s purpose will be to preserve the collective interests of spacefaring nations and enhance security in space. 3. Cislunar space NASA should evaluate whether its ambitious timeline and plans to explore the Moon are realistic. The United States should set out a plan to construct infrastructure at some of the Lagrange points by 2050. 4. Rocket transportation In the medium term (2025-2040) the United States should pursue rocket transportation for military and commercial purposes. 5. Emerging space defense technologies The United States should develop and deploy electromagnetic countermeasures to its most valuable satellites and downlink stations. 6. Public-private partnerships Innovation is critical to almost every aspect of the human race. To maintain the high ground in space current and future US administrations must meet recommended science technology and basic research levels. Future opportunities to incentivize bolster and minimize unnecessary restrictions when partnering with the commercial sector should be exploited. 7. Space critical infrastructure and cybersecurity Under the Biden administration the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) should be directed to evaluate whether space should be declared the seventeenth critical infrastructure sector. 8. Space propulsion and ISRU In the new administration NASA should work with the national laboratories to ensure there is a steady supply of satellite-grade nuclear material. As a short-term goal the United States and its industry partners should invest in technology that will enable in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) activity in support of space security. 9. Space situational awareness and space traffic-management While the United States should lead a global effort to minimize debris creation (or remove already-present debris) spacefaring nations will still need to operate in space despite the presence of debris. To do so improvements in SSA and STM are critical.

Strategy timeline

To be effectively executed this strategy for space security suggests several specific policy initiatives that can be considered and pursued within the next thirty years. The below list summarizes the policy recommendations and proposed timelines.

In the short term (2021 – 2025) The president should appoint and the Department of State should staff a special presidential envoy for space to socialize norms of responsible space behavior with likeminded nations.

The special presidential envoy to space should address the uncontrolled region between flight level 600 and the Kármán line.

US diplomats and policymakers should engage existing allies in forums like NATO about the need for coordinated activity in space.

The president should direct the National Space Council to create and regularly reexamine a long-term plan to develop a space security alliance.

NASA should evaluate the ambitious timeline of the Artemis program to determine if it is realistic and if needed adjust benchmarks for its deep-space exploration program.

The Department of Defense should invest in keystone technologies and seize future opportunities to bolster incentivize and minimize restrictions on collaboration with the private sector working with start-up ventures and innovative firms when practicable.

The Department of Defense should increase funding for defense science and technology and basic research.

NASA should work with the national laboratories to ensure a steady supply of satellite-grade nuclear material and include nuclear propulsion in its public-education programming.

To avoid redundancy across agency regulations the president should include in the National Space Council a body representing industry such as the Users’ Advisory Group.

The president should staff the National Space Council at the Cabinet level chaired by the vice president and the US Congress should draft legislation to make this body permanent.

CISA should evaluate whether space should be designated as a critical infrastructure sector.

Congress should continue to monitor the US Space Force and review space-related procurement processes.

The US federal government should incentivize subnational governments to review and draft legislation for space infrastructure and provide space-related state-university research grants.

The US federal government should seek continued improvements in SSA capabilities funding initiatives such as the Space Fence that improve the Space Surveillance Network particularly as it relates to smaller objects.

The US Department of Defense should seek collaborative partnerships with foreign nations to obtain higher-quality SSA data particularly tapping into geographic advantages that allies in the Eastern Hemisphere can offer.

The US federal government should work on a collaborative database for the fusing of SSA data improving on the steps initiated by the creation of CSpoC. This database should involve a lower level of classification than current data provided.

Under the guidance of the National Space Council authorities over SSA and STM should be transferred to a civil agency such as the Department of Commerce developing an open-architecture SSA repository with an extensive public catalog of SSA data. In the medium term (2025 – 2040) The special presidential envoy for space should achieve buy-in from likeminded nations on core principles of space exploration security and commerce to set the ground for a new comprehensive space treaty.

The State Department should transition the US special presidential envoy for space to an ambassador at large.

US and allied policymakers should review existing space treaties such as the Moon Treaty and the Space Liability Convention and incorporate viable components into a new space treaty.

The US and likeminded governments should synchronize domestic policies in constructing a framework for orbital-debris mitigation.

US government should work with NATO to prioritize a common understanding of space security and develop an ambitious set of aligned activity for space operations.

The Department of Defense should consider the implications of military satellites and space situational awareness on the routinization of cislunar space.

The United States along with its allies and partners should expand EW countermeasures to protect growing space assets against adversarial weapon systems.

The US Congress should consider authorizing a commission to evaluate whether an independent Department of the Space Force is warranted.

The special presidential envoy for space should achieve buy-in from likeminded nations on norms and standard operating procedures that allow for common access to new resources for ISRU activity.

The US government should build out rocket-transportation infrastructure and regulate point-to-point launch for commercial and military purposes eventually coordinating international regulations and constructing space ports with global partners.

The US Departments of Commerce and State should consult with relevant commercial entities on a set of best-practice guidelines for STM working to develop bottom-up guidelines that can then be brought to the international community. In the long term (2040 – 2050) The United States and likeminded nations should sign a foundational space treaty that recognizes the transforming nature of the domain and protects a growing future of space commerce.

The United States its existing allies and new partners should commit themselves to a space security alliance that pledges collective security and defense from attacks in the space domain with clear rules for membership funding dispute resolution and obligations.

NASA should develop infrastructure at the Lagrange points while US diplomats seek to negotiate an international framework to regulate use of these points among other valuable cislunar real estate.

US space agencies should invest in and sustain a “culture of education” especially in STEM fields with a heavy focus on artificial intelligence robotics and quantum-related technologies to name just a few specialized disciplines.

The United States should seize the mantle of international leader on STM norms capitalizing on what is likely to be an increase in market share in the commercial space sector. This will give the United States leverage to shape the rules and norms for STM. In coordination with allies and partners the United States should extend its SSA and STM efforts to cislunar space.

V. Conclusion

I have always found that plans are useless but planning is indispensable.

For centuries humankind has gazed up at the cosmos pondering life yet humans only reached this final frontier mere decades ago. Since human arrival in space the realm of possibility has drastically expanded to incorporate new spacefaring nations and companies new inventions and new orbits. One can only imagine the infinite value and potential that space will offer in the decades ahead. As we grapple with existential challenges on Earth we may continue to look to space to derive potential answers. While a thirty-year US strategy cannot begin to imagine the unimaginable a long-term vision is critical to advance the position of spacefaring nations and shape the future trajectory of this critical high ground.

Over the next thirty years space security will continue to evolve as legal frameworks and alliances are developed technologies advance and investments in public-private partnerships are made. In order for the United States to protect a promising future of space prosperity it must work with likeminded nations to: enhance a rules-based international order for space preserve US and allied leadership in space strengthen US and allied technological advantages in space and push space development to cislunar space. In the absence of concerted action humankind risks diminishing the immense value still being discovered in Earth orbit and beyond.

There are significant first-mover advantages that accrue to the leader of this new “space rush.” The United States can set the new do-no-harm standards for conduct in space like resource extraction and access to the Lagrange points. While the United States must be sober in its assessment of the importance of space in great-power competition it should seek peaceful exploration and cooperation with all spacefaring countries—including China and Russia—where possible. In the interest of global security on Earth and within space the United States must work with its allies and partners to normalize rules of conduct and engagement and deter against aggression in the space domain. In the timeframe of this strategy commerce in Earth orbit will become routine normal and unremarkable constituting an increasingly large share of global economic activity. Still this development faces serious threats. Through new space governance a new space security alliance and new space technology the United States can realize that vision while pushing humanity’s economic frontier into cislunar space.

The United States is not just a nation that uses space; it is a spacefaring nation. Space exploration value and security are tightly woven into the collective US psyche not to mention the US scientific commercial and military establishments. Russian rocketeer Konstantin Tsiolkovsky famously stated that “the Earth is the cradle of the mind but one cannot eternally live in a cradle.” It is time for the United States to fully enmesh Earth orbit in legal security and commercial apparatuses so that space exploration agencies can focus on cislunar space Mars and the boundless universe beyond.

In essence this strategy is laid out with the understanding that “plans are useless but planning is indispensable.” Determining what will and will not be the reality in 2050 is a futile exercise as benchmarks laid for the next decade may be eclipsed by great and unknown achievements in the coming years. However paving a roadmap to 2050 is helpful in shaping the goals policies and investments necessary to pursue enduring prosperity and security in space tomorrow. Keeping the future at the forefront regardless of developments that may materialize and on what timeline situates humankind to reap the benefits of space activity in perpetuity.

That’s a question the folks who select the finalists should probably be asking themselves right now after Menifield played the game of his life Saturday in a 75-47 victory over Iron Mountain in the Division 3 state championship game at the Breslin Center.

Is it because Menifield plays in Division 3?

Perhaps but Menifield certainly proved this season he can match up with the best competition in the state scoring a game-high 27 points when the Bucs played Orchard Lake St. Mary’s which spent the entire season ranked No. 1 in Division 1.

And Iron Mountain’s Forest Wonders who scored 13 points again Beecher is a finalist from D3.

Against previously unbeaten Iron Mountain Menifield scored 37 points as Beecher won its sixth state title since 2012 and ninth overall.

Is it any wonder coach Mike Williams who has led the Bucs to all six of the aforementioned championships has called Menifield the best player in the state and says nobody can guard him?

Williams has said Menifield is every bit as good as his previous point guards – Monte Morris Malik Ellison and Jalen Terry – if not better. And keep in mind Morris now plays for the Denver Nuggets Ellison was the 2013 Class C Player of the Year and Terry won that award the past two years.

Menifield’s 37 points are the most ever by a Beecher player in a state championship game. And this is a team that has played in 12 championship games winning nine.

Carmelo Harris scored 16 points for Beecher (16-1). Jurgen Kleiman added 12 points for Iron Mountain (19-1) and Dante Basanese had 11.

Here’s how the game developed:

Fourth quarter

0:00: Beecher wins sixth state title since 2012 and ninth overall with a 75-47 win over Iron Mountain.

1:04: Beecher 74 Iron Mountain 44. Keyon Menifield is on the bench with a Beecher record 37 points in a state finals game.

5:36: Beecher 66 Iron Mountain 32. Keyon Menifield with 35 points for Beecher Carmelo Harris with 16. Jurgen Kleiman with 12 for Iron Mountain.

Third quarter

0:00: It’s been the Keyon Menifield Show through three quarters. The Beecher senior has 31 points as many the entire Iron Mountain team. Beecher leads 62-31. Menifield by the way has no major college offers. Is Tom Izzo watching this game against his former high school team? Menifield is 14-for-21 from the field.

4:31: Beecher 47 Iron Mountain 24. This one is over boys and girls.

7:59: Second half underway

Not sure how Keyon Menifield wasn't a finalist for Mr. Basketball. He's certainly one of five best players in the state. — Greg Wickliffe (@GregWickliffe10) April 10 2021

Quick stats: Beecher shooting a blistering 61.5 percent (16-for-26) from the field. Iron Mountain at 31.8 percent. Iron Mountain with a 14-10 rebounding advantage but has nine turnovers to one for Beecher. Foster Wonders is scoreless for Iron Mountain.

Second quarter

0:00: Beecher 38 Iron Mountain 19. Keyon Menifield with 20 points on 9-for-15 shooting. (Do we need to say he plays for Beecher since Iron Mountain only has 19 points?) Carmelo Harris with 11 points for Beecher. Jurgen Kleiman with 10 points for Iron Mountain.

2:18: Holy cow! Keyon Menifield gets fouled and as he falls backwards to the floor from 15-17 feet away yet he still banks a shot and makes the free throw to give Beecher at 31-15 lead. Have I asked how this guy wasn’t a Mr. Basketball finalist?

3:25: Timeout with Beecher leading 26-15. Keyon Menifield with 12 points on 6-for-11 shooting. Carmelo Harris 4-for-5 en route to 11 points. Bests 1-2 guard combo in the state? They’re up there. Jurgen Kleiman with 10 points for Iron Mountain which has eight turnovers to Beecher’s one. Beecher shooting 57.9 percent.

Quick stats: Beecher shot 54.5 percent in the first quarter Iron Mountain 25 percent. Iron Mountain with six turnovers to one for Beecher.

First quarter

0:00: Beecher 16 Iron Mountain 8. Bucs went on a 13-0 run to take control. Keyon Menifield with eight points Carmelo Harris with seven for Beecher. Jurgen Kleiman with five for Iron Mountain. (Or as the Bally Sports analyst has twice called the Mountaineers “Iron City.”

1:43: Beecher forces a timeout with a 9-0 run to take a 12-6 lead. Keyon Menifield with six points already. How was this guy not a Mr. Basketball finalist? In the Bucs’ loss to Orchard Lake St. Mary’s he scored 27 points. More than anyone else on the floor. Carmelo Harris with five points for the Bucs.

3:36: Timeout with Iron Mountain leading 6-3. Mountaineers already have three turnovers though

4:09: Carmelo Harris of Beecher draws a charge from Foster Wonders. (Love that name!) Iron Mountain fans aren’t happy.

One thing about @BeecherSchools: The Bucs ALWAYS play great defense. You don't defend you don't play at Beecher. Been that way for years. — Brendan Savage (@BrendanSavage) April 10 2021

7:59: The Division 3 state championship game is underway. Beecher forces a turnover right out of the gate.

PREGAME

First year I covered the state basketball finals Flint Central won Class A and Corunna won Class B. That was 38 years ago. (Hamady lost in Class C.) Will the Flint-area take home two more state titles today? — Brendan Savage (@BrendanSavage) April 10 2021

Starting lineups

Iron Mountain: Foster Wonders Bryce Pietrantonio Jurgen Kleiman Ricky Brown C. Evosevich-Hynes

Beecher: Taylin Muldrew Micah Brown Jr. James Cummings II Keyon Menifield Jr. Carmelo Harris

– Beecher will be trying to make it 2-for-2 for the Flint area after Grand Blanc won the Division 1 state title with a 45-36 win over Ann Arbor Huron. The Bucs are seeking the ninth state title in school history.

The history

Perennial MHSAA power Flint Beecher will be seeking its ninth boys basketball state championship when the Bucs square off against Iron Mountain in today’s Division 3 title game at Michigan State’s Breslin Center.

Tipoff is scheduled for 3 p.m.

Five of Beecher’s state championships came during an incredible six-year stretch from 2012-17. That included three straight beginning in 2015.

Iron Mountain is seeking its fourth state championship and first since 1939. The Mountaineers reached the Division 3 state final in 2019 losing to Pewamo-Westphalia.

Beecher was No. 6 in the final Associated Press rankings this season and Iron Mountain was No. 3

Chrissy Sieben 38 was the passenger on a motorcycle being driven by her boyfriend when it clipped the rear of an RV Wednesday evening while going around a curve on Iron Mountain Road west of Redding near Keswick Dam Road said her brother Stephen Grogan.

""She was beat up pretty bad"" he said.

In addition to having a broken back she suffered a broken wrist and scrapes. Sieben's boyfriend also was hospitalized.

Sieben a mental health tech at Shasta Regional Medical Center underwent a 12-hour emergency surgery at Mercy Medical Center Grogan said.

""She's slowly getting sensation in her legs again. She will have to learn how to walk again and have physical therapy"" he said. ""We still have some hard times ahead.""

Grogan said Sieben is the mother of four with one son being adopted. The oldest is a girl 19 years old and the boys range from 16 to 10.

As a health care worker Grogan said his sister contracted COVID-19 in the fall.

Grogan described his sister as the cornerstone of their family who would host gatherings at her home.

""She's a solid outspoken hard worker independent family-oriented person. She's like the bedrock of our family"" Grogan said.

Grogan said his sister's insurance won't cover all her expenses so he and another sister Monique Chivrell organized a Gofundme account also to help with living expenses.

As of midafternoon Saturday donors had given $3085 of the $5000 goal.

Walmart has started clinics for the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine to residents 18 and older with its mobile wellness trucks.

A truck will be set up at St. James Baptist Church in Fayetteville noon to 4 p.m. Sunday. Shots will be given by appointment only. Call (833) 886-0023 to register.

Some clinics will operate daily. The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Northwest is offering appointments at its drive-through Pfizer vaccine clinic 10 a.m. to 5:40 p.m. Monday through Friday at its annex location at Woolsey Avenue and North Street in Fayetteville.

Demand is increasing said Dr. Sharon Reece lead physician for the clinic. Organizers encourage residents to register to avoid wasting doses she said. Anyone 16 and older can schedule an appointment. A photo ID is required. Those receiving a shot don't have to be U.S. citizens or have health insurance. Spanish and Marshallese translators are available on-site.

The clinic is averaging about 100 Pfizer shots a day Reece said. The first event was April 1. Starting next week the university plans to give out about 200 doses a day in Northwest Arkansas she said.

The idea is to provide a reliable clinic at the same times every day that people can expect Reece said.

""It's a bit of a juggling act. But we do try to be accommodating whenever possible"" she said.

Veterans can get a Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccine 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Friday at Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks in Fayetteville at the primary care entrance. On Saturdays veterans can get a vaccine at the Building 21 laboratory area. No appointment is necessary.

Benton County and Collier Drug Store will host their third clinic at the Benton County Fairgrounds auditorium 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Wednesday.

The county's clinic administered more than 2000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine at its first two events said Michael Waddle Benton County emergency manager. The goal is to inject 10000 arms in about 10 weeks he said.

People are asked to register for the clinic beforehand. A link is posted at the county's Facebook page at facebook.com/BentonCountyAR or residents can call (479) 935-4316 to set up an appointment.

Registering beforehand makes it easier to manage the flow of shots but people who show up without registering will be accepted Waddle said. Registering also cuts down on potential wait time he said.

The first two vaccination events filled up spots within hours Waddle said. He suspected people coming through in the coming weeks likely will have more questions than those who signed up immediately. Physicians will be available he said.

Groups such as churches also can set up blocks of time to get their members vaccinated all at once Waddle said.

The Northwest Arkansas Council will host another round of clinics in Benton and Washington counties this week. A Thursday walk-in clinic will be 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the former Sears service center at the Northwest Arkansas Mall in Fayetteville. Another clinic will be 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. Friday at Building C of the J.B. Hunt Headquarters in Lowell.

The council held two clinics at the same locations last week and administered more than 2200 doses.

The council plans to administer 5000 Pfizer shots every week for 10 weeks. The hope is to keep the vaccination rate in Northwest Arkansas at or above the state average said Ryan Cork executive director of the council's Health Care Transformation Division.

Benton and Washington counties had 71550 residents fully vaccinated against covid-19 as of Friday while another 57774 had received the first of two doses according to the Arkansas Department of Health.

The two counties have a combined population of 384234 residents 16 and older so about 19% of that group have been fully vaccinated while about 15% are halfway there.

By comparison 523894 people in the state have been fully vaccinated with 358454 halfway there. That equates to 22% fully vaccinated and 15% with one of two doses among more than 2.3 million people 16 and older in the state.

Washington County had 157 new virus cases from April 3 through Friday. Benton County had 141 new cases.

Washington County had 185 active cases Friday. Benton County had 201.

So far covid-19 has killed 753 people in the two counties according to Health Department data.

Anyone 16 and older can receive the Pfizer shot. The Northwest Arkansas Council asks 16- and 17-year-olds get consent from a parent or guardian.

The council is considering expanding hours of the clinics into the evening to accommodate residents' work schedules and having clinics on Saturdays Cork said. Registration is requested but walk-ins are accepted as well he said.

""Making it as uncomplicated as possible is our goal"" Cork said.

Members of the public get shots of a Covid-19 vaccine Thursday April 8 2021 during a weekly mass vaccination event sponsored by the Northwest Arkansas Council at J.B. Hunt headquarters in Lowell.

This company which is in the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

This payment processsing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.38%.

For the last reported quarter Jack Henry came out with earnings of $1.22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share representing a surprise of 7.02%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.39 per share delivering a surprise of 7.75%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Jack Henry estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Jack Henry has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

DeGrom (0-1) looked unhittable early -- until Jazz Chisholm Jr. barreled a 100.4 mph 0-2 fastball thrown above the strike zone in the second inning. The left-handed hitter's drive reached the second deck in right field and was estimated at 402 feet.

It was the first 0-2 homer deGrom has allowed in the majors.

""[Chisholm] sold out for it'' deGrom said. ""Probably should have done a better job recognizing he was going to try to get to that fastball.""

The homer was all Miami could muster against deGrom. The right-hander reached 14 strikeouts for the fourth time -- including three times against the Marlins. He allowed a run five hits walked none and threw 76 of his 95 pitches for strikes.

Plagued throughout his career by insufficient run support deGrom was tagged with another disappointing loss. He even accounted for one of New York's three hits.

""Unfortunately we've been through this before'' center fielder Brandon Nimmo said. ""It's never easy.''

Marlins left-hander Trevor Rogers didn't make things easy for the Mets fanning 10 in six to beat deGrom for the second time in nine major league starts. The 23-year-old got his first big-league win against deGrom in a 5-3 victory last Aug. 31.

""Best in baseball Jacob deGrom is'' Rogers said. ""You really have to bring your best and then some. To see me and our whole team go out and compete with the best it just shows you how good we are.''

A 2017 first-round draft pick Rogers cruised against New York as he scattered three hits and two walks retiring 11 straight in one stretch.

Rogers mixed a fastball averaging 95 mph with a slider and changeup inducing 19 swing-and-misses among his 82 pitches. He ended his outing with strikeouts of Michael Conforto and Pete Alonso stranding two runners to preserve a 1-0 lead.

Dylan Floro followed with a perfect seventh; Richard Bleier was helped by shortstop Miguel Rojas' diving catch to rob pinch-hitter Kevin Pillar during a 1-2-3 eighth and Yimi Garcia completed the three-hitter for his first save who was called on instead of struggling closer Anthony Bass.

New York closer Edwin Diaz meanwhile relieved deGrom and struggled. Starling Marte hit a leadoff double and scored the next at-bat on a single by Jesus Aguilar. Rojas added an RBI single before Diaz was pulled and booed off the mound.

Mets fans also jeered Conforto who struck out three times to extend a slump to start what could be his final season in New York. The right fielder is set to become a free agent in the fall.

DEGROMINANT

The 32-year-old deGrom looked better than ever in his eighth major league season. Not only is he averaging 99 mph with his fastball -- up from 94 mph when he debuted in 2014 -- he's throwing it with more ""rise"" too. The pitch is dropping one inch less on average than it did in 2020 making it look to batters like it's moving up in the strike zone as it approaches.

DeGrom punched out at least 10 hitters for the 47th time passing Dwight Gooden for second-most in Mets history trailing only Tom Seaver's 60.

New York starters have turned in four quality starts in the team's first five games but sit at 2-3 on the season.

Sebastopol Police Chief Kevin Kilgore confirmed the arrest of the former mayor by phone Saturday afternoon and released a statement with initial information about the allegations.

Kilgore said that on March 30 police received information of potential sexual assaults that occurred in the city between December 2019 and March 2021.

“Right now that investigation is ongoing for a determination as to the number of victims” Kilgore said.

Jacob 44 was arrested about 7 a.m. Saturday. Police said they contacted Jacob in the 7400 block of Woodland Avenue and took him into custody on an arrest warrant outlining several felony sexual assault crimes against a minor.

Jacob was transported to the Sonoma County Main Adult Detention Facility and is being held without bail.

Police said anyone with information is asked to contact Sebastopol Police at 707-829-4400 and refer to Report No. 21-0220.

Jacob was listed as an inmate at the Sonoma County Jail on suspicion of five felonies and one misdemeanor. The offenses include sex with a minor and transporting a minor for the purposes of having sex with them distribution of child pornography and soliciting a minor for lewd purposes.

Current Sebastopol Mayor Una Glass said she was notified of the arrest by the city manager and Kilgore. But she said she was not informed of the specific allegations or offenses.

“He’s no longer on our City Council” Glass said. “This is very very disappointing and I hope the victims of anything that he has done are taken care (of) … it’s extremely disappointing.”

Jacob who founded the Sebastopol medical marijuana dispensary Peace in Medicine in 2007 was elected to the City Council in 2012. The following year he was selected mayor by the council members making history as one of the first mayors in the nation with a background in the medical marijuana industry.

In March 2016 Jacob took a leave of absence to care for his ailing mother and stepped down from his role with Peace in Medicine which merged with the Sparc marijuana dispensary in 2017.

Why it matters: House Republicans held a vote on an antisemitism bill last week that Democrats complained was inadequate to address the issue and geared toward dividing the left.

Driving the news: Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) is introducing another bill first obtained by Axios to provide $280 million to the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights.

The office is in charge of enforcing federal laws against discrimination at schools including antisemitism and Islamophobia.

The bill has seven co-sponsors: Reps. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.) Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) Kathy Manning (D-N.C.) Nikema Williams (D-Ga.) and André Carson (D-Ind.).

The intrigue: Funding for the office was cut by 25% in the federal spending bill Congress passed in March from $140 million in fiscal year 2023 to $105 million in 2024.

House Republicans targeted diversity and inclusion programs and other socially progressive initiatives throughout the government in negotiations with Senate Democrats.

What they're saying: ""Far too many Jews are feeling the need to hide once again especially students on college campuses across America"" Goldman who is Jewish said in a statement.

""In this pivotal moment it is absolutely critical that we do everything we can to drive out hate in all its forms — from our schools from our cities and from our nation.""

Zoom out: House Republicans are planning a multi-committee effort to target college antisemitism as pro-Palestinian demonstrations continue at universities across the country.

Johnson has also floated other punitive legislative efforts such as eliminating tax breaks for colleges and stripping student visas.

Democrats have argued that legislation such as Manning's bill to create a nation antisemitism coordinator warrants consideration under this effort to no avail.

Between the lines: Democrats are trying to seize the initiative from Republicans on college antisemitism as members of the party grow worried about the campus protests blowing back on them politically.

Republicans have promised to hit Democrats on the issue through ads as the 2024 election heats up.

The Senate companion bill to Goldman's was introduced by Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) one of several vulnerable Democratic incumbents up for re-election this cycle.

Reality check: Johnson's office did not respond to questions about whether the bill would get a vote. But one House Republican close to the speaker said there is a ""0%"" chance it's put on the floor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25mbC9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzQwMDkwMDA4L2V4LWJyb3ducy10ZXhhbnMtcmItZHVrZS1qb2huc29uLXJldGlyZXMtOC1zZWFzb25zLW5mbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ex-Browns Texans RB Duke Johnson retires after 8 seasons in NFL,"Open Extended Reactions

Running back Duke Johnson announced his retirement Sunday after playing eight seasons in the NFL.

Drafted in the third round by the Cleveland Browns in 2015 out of the University of Miami where he became the school's all-time leading rusher Johnson played for four NFL teams. He last played in the league in 2022 when he appeared in a game for the Buffalo Bills.

""8 Years 4 teams with 1 goal in mind create a better life for my family"" he posted to Instagram. ""I never dreamed of being the all time leading rusher of my dream school or being somewhere on the list of all time players to come out of South FL. I just wanted an opportunity to play a game to provide a better life for my family and I was able to do just that. I want to thank each team for giving me the chance to play and represent your organization and all the fans that supported me through the highs and lows.""

He added: ""Last but DEFINITELY NOT LEAST I want to thank my GOD for allowing me to take this journey and end it in the same health I started it in. With that being said I'm officially retiring from the NFL. I hope I left a greater impression on y'all that's bigger than football.""

House Speaker Mike Johnson continues to oversee one of the narrowest House majorities in history leaving little margin for error as he navigates his conference and faces threats to his leadership.

Republicans control 217 seats while Democrats control 213 after Democratic Rep. Tim Kennedy of New York was sworn in Monday evening. There are currently five vacant seats.

That breakdown leaves Republicans with a one-vote margin which means they can only afford one defection from within their conference to still pass legislation on a party-line when all members are present and voting. A tie vote in the House is a fail.

In addition to the tight margin there is always the possibility that absences can further impact the vote math.

The tight vote margin means that any individual member has the potential to exert outsized influence and Johnson has frequently felt pressure from his right flank.

The extremely narrow margin has forced the speaker to put high-profile bills directly onto the floor under a procedural move known as suspension of the rules in certain instances as his right flank has increasingly taken to tanking rule votes on the floor in a show of protest.

But that strategy compels the need for a two-thirds majority to pass bills requiring significant Democratic support and further alienating Johnson from the right wing of his conference.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDUvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvcHJpc29uLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For Markus Johnson Prison and Mental Illness Equaled a Death Sentence,"Markus Johnson slumped naked against the wall of his cell skin flecked with pepper spray his face a mask of puzzlement exhaustion and resignation.

The star has 'mountains of public goodwill' to offset negativity ...,"Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson’s nice guy reputation has been taking some hits — but the “mountains of public goodwill” he’s built over the years should outshine the drama an expert tells Yahoo Entertainment.

A recent report from the Wrap saw more than a dozen people who worked with Johnson on the upcoming holiday action-comedy film Red One criticize his “chronic lateness and lack of professionalism on set.”

Insiders claimed the Black Adam actor — who co-stars alongside Chris Evans and J.K. Simmons — “was late an average of seven to eight hours per day and missed several entire days of production” resulting in the movie running at least $50 million over budget. They pointed fingers at the film’s “inexperienced” lead producer Hiram Garcia who is Johnson’s ex-brother-in-law and ex-personal assistant for letting things spiral. An insider called the situation “a f***ing disaster” and claimed “Dwayne truly doesn’t give a f***.”

Sources claimed Johnson’s lateness is a pattern saying he had a “huge fight” with an “infuriated” Ryan Reynolds after showing up five hours late to the set of their movie Red Notice in 2020. There’s also a wild story about him urinating in water bottles (something he previously copped to doing).

A spokesperson for Amazon MGM the film studio behind Red One denied the claims in the report calling Johnson and his production company Seven Bucks “incredible partners.” Johnson insiders told the outlet he “averaged no more than one hour late” and “the budget did not deviate much from the agreed-upon figure.” Johnson’s rep did not respond to Yahoo’s request for comment.

Despite the scathing report a crisis and PR expert doesn’t expect this to cause lasting damage to Johnson’s reputation.

“There is a better chance of Martians landing on the lawn of the Biden White House than this ever permanently hurting the Rock” Eric Schiffer of Reputation Management Consultants tells Yahoo.

What’s going on with Johnson?

In addition to being one of the most bankable actors in Hollywood Johnson is one of the most likable celebrities — and a large part of that is due to his strong work ethic. Johnson brands himself as a hard worker — his Instagram with 397 million followers shows a dizzying schedule of gym time movie shoots meetings adorable girl dad moments and philanthropy.

Johnson’s production company Seven Bucks is a nod to his bank account balance when he was cut from a pro football team at age 22. It made the then broke star pivot to a career in wrestling rising through the ranks at the World Wrestling Federation (later called World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) before crossing over to Hollywood and starring in the Fast and the Furious and Jumanji franchises. In 2016 Forbes listed Johnson as the highest-paid actor and currently estimates his net worth at $270 million between his movies production company wrestling endorsements and brands. A key part of his success is being able to connect with the masses but not forgetting his roots which is why many want to see him run for president.

It seems that over the last year-plus however there have been some negative headlines. The biggest prior to now was in September when he and Oprah Winfrey faced backlash after asking people to donate to their Maui wildfire fund — instead of giving more of their own money. He acknowledged the criticism and he and Winfrey quietly donated more than they had pledged.

The drama has been simmering elsewhere: His bankability took a small hit with 2022’s Black Adam which didn’t perform as well as anticipated and he faced criticism over how he handled it. The Wrap story also seemed to confirm that Johnson attempted to have his production company take over the DC films universe in 2022. It didn’t happen and Johnson going around others for the secret meeting didn’t sit well. Variety reported on that in 2023 with an insider saying Johnson’s “demands” — including having his brand of tequila served at a premiere of PG-13-rated Black Adam — “increased and the returns just weren’t there.”

This year Johnson made a big return to WWE and was appointed to the board of its parent company TKO but he was booed by fans for being almost two hours late to an April event. Recently he’s been hamming it up to play the villain in the pro wrestling storyline. The same week the View audience jeered the mention of his name for saying he won’t be endorsing a presidential candidate in the 2024 election. (He endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 but said he learned that sharing his political opinions only causes division.)

The Wrap story has brought back into conversation Johnson’s infamous feud with his Fast and the Furious franchise co-star Vin Diesel. If Johnson really does show up eight hours late to set — or not at all — that could certainly fuel tension (though reports at the time also cited Diesel’s lateness). The article also surfaces drama with Reynolds noting that the co-stars “didn’t speak for years” after their fall 2020 blowup but have since patched things up.

There’s been counterprogramming to the Wrap story. An unconfirmed report from Puck suggests that “unflattering” press about Johnson may stem from a former publicist. People magazine ran a story about Johnson’s “flourishing career” and how he’s found “success in many areas” with an unnamed source saying “People love him.” And the Rock’s own Instagram feed has been filled with sweet fan encounters and charitable endeavors.

Years of building a good reputation will ‘offset these recent damaging allegations’

It’s true — people do love Johnson who has spent years cultivating a good reputation and it should help see him through this negative patch of press.

“The best strategy for the Rock is to tackle the bad press in a setting where he can poke fun at himself and the facts of his situation” says Schiffer. “The Rock is beloved globally and has built mountains of public goodwill that can offset these recent damaging allegations.”

How does a star like Johnson who will voice the Maui character in the Moana sequel out later this year break the cycle of bad press? By “addressing the negative items with empathy and truth owning your part in it and then showing what you learned” says Schiffer.

He adds “The Rock did that well with the outcry in Hawaii and will likely do the same with the hits on being late on the set of his film.”"

We often greet each other with the standard question “How are you doing?” I have a standard response of late — “Every week is better than the last.” And it’s true.

COVID-19 numbers have been on a dramatic decline vaccination numbers are rising and economic indicators are showing signs of what could be a strong recovery. Specifically our most recent sales tax check was more than 4% higher than the same month a year ago (the last month before the pandemic). And our city’s unemployment rate is below 5% for the second month in a row and one of the lowest among all large cities.

Some of the city’s relative economic success through this pandemic was organic but some of it was the product of hard work by public and private entities determined to keep a safety net in place for our small businesses. The city of Oklahoma City deployed tens of millions of dollars to support small businesses and worked closely with entities like the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber the Alliance for Economic Development the Independent Shopkeepers Association the Black Chamber and others to provide that foundation.

Another entity that has been at the center of our community’s response to the economic fallout of the pandemic is Progress OKC a nonprofit dedicated to advancing social and economic opportunities in Oklahoma City. Throughout this experience they have supported small businesses with one-on-one services and a new program is now available.

Building Businesses Back Better (B4) is a program now open to small businesses in Oklahoma City that includes consulting services and help accessing new funding.

While many factors led to the dispositions including a potential changing tax code lessons from the pandemic were still fresh on executives’ minds. The assets had bridge floating-rate debt that matured in a couple of years. So JRK’s president Bobby Lee decided to pass on potentially better returns by selling the assets.

“We just felt like the uncertainty level went up” Lee says. “I’m still very bullish on multifamily long-term but I think the risk of something happening right now that you don’t foresee—something Black Swanish—is underpriced in the market today.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vbGVhZGVycy8yMDIxLzA0LzEwL3JpZGluZy1oaWdoLWluLWEtd29ya2Vycy13b3JsZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Riding high in a workers' world,"I N THE POPULAR imagination the past four decades were wonderful for the owners of capital and miserable for labour. The rich world’s workers endured competition from trade relentless technological change more unequal wages and tepid recoveries from recessions. Investors and companies enjoyed expanding global markets liberalised finance and low corporate taxes. Even before covid-19 this caricature of broken labour markets was mistaken. Today as the economy emerges from the pandemic a reversal of the primacy of capital over labour beckons—and it will come sooner than you think.

It might seem premature to predict a wonderful world of work only a year on from a labour-market catastrophe. But America is showing how rapidly jobs can come back as the virus recedes. In the spring of 2020 the country’s unemployment rate was nearly 15%. Now it is already just 6% after a year containing five of the ten best months for hiring in history. Public perceptions of how easy it is to find a job have already recovered to levels that it took nearly a decade to reach after the global financial crisis. And even in Europe which is suffering a third wave of infections the labour market is beating forecasts as economies adapt to virus-containment measures."

Kimberly Cline who heads the university with campuses in Brooklyn and Long Island pulled down $1861026 in 2018 making her the 16th highest-paid president of a private university in the country according to a ranking by the Chronicle of Higher Education.

Cline made more than the heads of Ivy League Cornell Dartmouth and Yale and top-ranked Stanford University.

She heads a university that enrolled 15540 students in 2020 a 16 percent decline from the 18622 enrolled in 2015 state records show.

“I don’t think LIU ranks anywhere near the top 20 for most recognized most research productivity highest graduation rates best value for graduate placements or salaries or any other measure” said Rebecca States a physical therapy professor and president of the Faculty Senate on the Brooklyn campus.

States noted that the average professor’s salary was about $100000.

“The board of trustees should be ashamed of itself for paying the president of LIU more than the president of Yale” another professor said.

The university cut about 100 positions during the pandemic including secretaries clerks and academic counselors according to a Newsday report.

Christopher Fevola the university’s chief financial officer said many jobs had been restored but he would not provide specifics.

Fevola said Cline’s 2018 compensation was an “outlier” because she received a $886619 payout from her retirement plan on top of her base pay of $853897.

“It isn’t the true characterization of what the president’s annual salary is” he said.

Cline also gets housing on the grounds of the Brookville campus a benefit valued at $79269 the university’s tax filing shows.

This latest lawsuits were filed March 23. Cadiz is not a direct party to the suits but would be impacted by any resulting decision. One suit is against the federal Bureau of Land Management by the Center for Biological Diversity Earthjustice and the Sierra Club. It asks the federal court to overturn a December BLM decision to approve the conversion of an idle oil and gas pipeline to carry water from Cadiz’s desert aquifer.



The other lawsuit was filed by the Native American Land Conservancy and the National Parks Conservation Association. That suit alleges that the BLM failed to consult with Native American tribes before granting the pipeline approval.

The filings marks the third decade in which Cadiz’ water transfer plan has faced legal challenges from environmental groups. Cadiz which purchased the land over the Mojave Desert aquifer in the 1980s has prevailed in the vast majority of the cases.



This 217-mile pipeline which Cadiz acquired in 2011 from El Paso Natural Gas Co. (now owned by Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc.) extends west from the Cadiz Valley in the middle of the Mojave Desert to the southern tip of the Central Valley near the California Aqueduct. It passes near interconnecting pipelines in the Barstow area that convey water to High Desert communities.



Cadiz also has approvals to build a 43-mile pipeline to connect the aquifer to the Colorado River Aqueduct and then to water agency customers in Southern California. That proposed pipeline has also endured a long legal battle.



In the lawsuit over the idle oil and gas pipeline conservation groups say that in the last weeks of the Trump administration the Interior Department gave Cadiz approval to convey water through the pipeline without a proper environmental review.



“The Trump administration did one last favor to Cadiz by granting this right-of-way without any public review” Ileene Anderson senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity said in a statement.



But the plaintiffs said the real aim of their lawsuit was to put a permanent end to Cadiz’s water transfer plan.



“This massive water-privatization scheme would dry up life-giving desert springs and seeps that some of California’s rarest desert species rely on” Anderson said.



Cadiz issued a statement after the March 23 lawsuit filing.



“Cadiz has been working for five years to ready an idle already-constructed oil and gas pipeline to use for the better environmental purpose of transporting needed water between disadvantaged and underserved communities in Inland California” the statement said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Chief among these fintech giants is Klarna a Swedish firm that raised $1 billion last month at a valuation of $31 billion.

Two of Klarna's cofounders became billionaires after the fundraise. The third Niklas Adalberth sold most of his equity since departing in 2015 to go into philanthropy and impact investing. The 39-year-old told Insider he left the firm in order to create ""something net-positive"" for society.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""I think Klarna does a lot of great things. But we also enable people to pay for purchases in installments"" Adalberth told Insider from his home in Stockholm. ""Is that really what the world needs to buy stuff that they might not need at a certain interest that they're going to pay off in the future?""

Klarna's most popular payment option comprises four interest-free installments which can incur late fees. There is also a basic financing option with an annual percentage rate (APR) of up to 19.99%.

For better or worse BNPL companies enable shoppers to buy items they cannot afford. An analysis conducted by Cardify.ai which uses data from mobile rewards platform Drop found that 21% of BNPL users did not have enough funds to afford their purchase upfront.

It took years for Adalberth who was 24 when he cofounded Klarna in 2005 to realize he wanted more than wealth.

""When I started Klarna I had this belief that money correlated with happiness"" he said. ""It was really egotistic from a start in that sense.""

After a fund raise for Klarna in 2012 Adalberth and his cofounders were able to sell some of their equity for the first time. Overnight he had $10 million in his bank account. He decided to celebrate by stopping by Las Vegas while flying from Stockholm to San Francisco for a conference. He splurged on a business-class flight a hotel suite overlooking the Strip fine dining and a designer shopping spree.

""But living this dream I started to get this bad feeling that 'Hey I can't really taste the difference between this wine and the s--- wine I have at home. I don't sleep better in this panorama suite compared to my IKEA bed at home'"" he said. ""I started to look at these [shopping] bags and they looked back at me as if they had some kind of message. And that message was 'You're so pathetic. How could you believe that all of this consumption or stuff could in any way buy happiness or meaningfulness?'""

After the trip he started therapy and went on retreats. He began to reevaluate his priorities which led to his decision to leave Klarna in 2015. A year later he started the Norrsken Foundation a ""tech for good"" nonprofit that he has funded with €140 million (about $165 million).

Adalberth believes that philanthropy and impact investing are more popular in the US than his native country. (""In Sweden people think they do everything they have to by paying taxes""). He is hopeful that more high-net-worth Europeans will follow in his stead.

""I do think there's more people out there that feel some kind of emptiness after they made way too money"" he said. "" Extraordinary resources also comes with some extraordinary responsibility.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9kdC5jby5uei9uZXdzL2FydHMtZmVzdGl2YWwtZHVuZWRpbi9idXJuaW5nLWRlc2lyZS1wZXJmb3Jt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A burning desire to perform,"Rollicking Entertainment founder and performer Lizzie Tollemache and performer Paul Klaass rehearse for their Dunedin Arts Festival 2021 show. PHOTO: FLASH GORDON PHOTOGRAPHY

How would you describe your show for the Dunedin Arts Festival?

Free circus stunts and silliness to thrill and delight you.

How did you and Paul Klaass whom you are performing with meet?

At The World Buskers Festival. We kept running into each other at festivals across the country so David Ladderman and I asked Paul to jump in on some gigs with Rollicking Entertainment. David and I founded Rollicking Entertainment together in 2014 but this particular street show is with Paul Klaass.

You have performed at 50 festivals across nine countries. How has Covid-19 affected your work?

Well there’s been a distinct lack of international touring lately. Our company certainly lost a lot of work over Covid-19 cancellations but we are very grateful to have weathered the storm in Aotearoa where the opportunities to connect with audiences came back a lot faster than most places.

What is the greatest challenge in performing this show?

The risk of Dunedin weather getting a bit frisky.

Do you still get worried when performing stunts?

I’m focused and careful rather than worried.

How did you find out stunts and circus performing was your calling?

I stumbled into it. I learnt fire-eating and stage combat at the last minute to cover for a friend who got a gig opportunity in Italy. Instantly addicted.

Where do you look for artistic inspiration?

Everywhere. Anywhere. You can find inspiration in the most unlikely of places.",,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately that is not the case for a food that many of us might have in our pantries as we speak. The brand that's arguably been the best-known macaroni and cheese for decades is being sued for allegedly using an ingredient that's been shown to harm the health of some children for years leading to hormonal issues asthma and more. Before you prepare for a pantry purge we've got details.

Kraft Macaroni & Cheese allegedly contains chemicals that have been connected with allergies asthma obesity and hormone interference in children—this according to what some trade websites for the legal profession are reporting about the matter. It's not entirely clear what led two plaintiffs to bring a case against the Kraft Heinz Company (which makes Kraft Macaroni & Cheese) on April 5 in the Northern District of California. However immediate research suggests that at least one of the two plaintiffs could possibly have someone in their family who may have been negatively impacted by the chemical that the plaintiffs are calling the Kraft Heinz Company out for. At the moment the specific circumstances seem unclear and we're careful not to speculate.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Costco Foods You Should Always Avoid According to Nutritionists

So while there are some details that seem unknown perhaps the important point to note is that some consumer advocates have reportedly been calling on the makers of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese to remove phthalates from the product since 2017. If this is true then Kraft Heinz is likely aware of the claims regarding their alleged use of phthalates and this lawsuit contends that they knowingly continued to use the chemicals in Kraft Macaroni & Cheese—despite the dangers about phthalates that some scientists have documented. Namely a 2015 study found that ""immunologic changes including increased propensity to develop wheeze allergy and asthma after dietary and inhalation exposure to these chemicals may be occurring.""

It seems more could unfold as this Kraft Macaroni & Cheese lawsuit gets underway. In the meantime be aware.

The community’s journey towards the title of Kraft Hockeyville 2021 came to a close on April 10th when NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman announced Elsipogtog First Nation as this year’s winner on Sportsnet’s Hockey Night in Canada broadcast.

Hockey is the heart and soul of Elsipogtog First Nation in New Brunswick. The community’s arena has always been a catalyst for connection since it opened its doors in 1979. Whether it’s hockey community meetings dancing or even boxing matches Elsipogtog First Nation’s arena has become a home away from home for every member of the community. Some members of the community feel that the racism or daily challenges faced by First Nations fuels their commitment to the game of hockey and their constant drive to play harder and better.

Their massive community push towards the Kraft Hockeyville 2021 title demonstrated this determination firsthand. As Elsipogtog First Nation mourned the recent tragic loss of Craig Sock and Seth Monahan two beloved members of their community they rallied together with strength and passion to win Kraft Hockeyville. Elsipogtog First Nation was motivated by their desire to rebuild their community rink after a fire caused significant structural damage leaving the arena inoperable to this day. After an incredible effort to get back to playing the game the community loves we are thrilled to announce Elsipogtog First Nation as the 2021 Kraft Hockeyville champions!

Elsipogtog First Nation will receive $250000 for upgrades to Chief Young Eagle Recreation Centre an opportunity to host an NHL® preseason game and $10000 worth of youth hockey equipment from NHLPA’s Goals & Dreams fund. Decisions regarding the Kraft Hockeyville NHL® preseason game venue and timing will be made by Kraft Hockeyville partners at a later date. The remaining community finalists will also be awarded $25000 each for arena upgrades and the winner and each of the three-runner up communities will receive $10000 to purchase brand new hockey equipment for their minor hockey programs courtesy of the NHLPA Goals & Dreams fund.

The announcement officially brings the 15th annual Kraft Hockeyville program to a close. This year’s program received thousands of nominations from all across the country each story demonstrated that Canadians are highly motivated and united behind a common love of sport community and connection. Throughout most nomination stories this year there was a common thread a desire to break down barriers to hockey and the importance of preserving the rink as a shared space to come together in person after the COVID-19 pandemic.



“Every community that participated in this year’s program has a unique local story but they all share an incredible passion for hockey and a drive to bring their community together through the love of the game” said Matt Bruce Senior Brand Manager Kraft Heinz Canada. “We would like to extend our congratulations to Elsipogtog First Nation and all of this year’s finalists for their passion for the program and commitment to their community.”

Smith’s a division of The Kroger Co. had its associates in 141 stores engage with customers during an in-store volunteer event on April 7 to explain the importance of recycling plastic and bring awareness to the recycling service available.

“Instead of plastic bags ending up in landfills or littering green spaces we utilize innovative services to turn the material into plastic lumber for the constructions of community benches and other items” said Aubriana Martindale Smith’s Corporate Affairs Manager in a press release. “Earth Month is a great catalyst for action and awareness. Instead of throwing out plastic shopping bags and other plastic items we encourage our customers to deposit them in containers located in the vestibules of our stores and help us turn more bags into benches.”



makes it easy to recycle thin-filter plastic materials because shoppers can bring these items to their neighborhood store and deposit them into bins located in the front vestibule. Plastic bags and other thin-filter plastics are then collected and recycled into other products such as park benches plastic landscape bricks and plastic lumber.



Plastic materials customers are encouraged to recycle in the store include:

Bubble wrap

Plastic overwrap around paper towels

Cereal box liners

Bread bags

Dry cleaning bags

Produce bags

Newspaper sleeves

Plastic shipping envelopes

Clean sandwich bags.

In 2020 Smith’s recycled 39 million pounds of plastic from its stores and has committed to phasing out single-use plastic bags by 2025. Some estimates suggest that 100 billion single-use plastic bags are thrown away in the U.S. every year.

Currently less than 5% of plastic bags are recycled annually in America and single-use plastic bags are the fifth-most common single-use plastic found in the environment by magnitude. Smith’s also encourages the use of reusable bags through their fuel incentive program offering 5 fuel points at check out for every reusable bag used (up to 50 fuel points per transaction).

Say hello to curling the next competitive sport in Las Vegas

Executives of the Southern Nevada’s publicly traded tourism companies would just as soon forget about their fourth-quarter earnings reports.

But they also have a lot to look forward to in future earnings seasons.

Just as government leaders and health-care professionals have asked the public to be patient about a return to normalcy so must the casino airline and gaming equipment manufacturing companies that represent the local tourism economy.

In the fourth quarter nine of the 21 public companies the Review-Journal business staff monitors reported fourth-quarter profits totaling $716.5 million.

The bad news was that the losses for the other 12 companies came in at an estimated $2.553 billion.

Frankly the first quarter of 2021 isn’t likely to be much to write home about either considering that capacity restrictions will remain in place through at least May 1.

With capacity restrictions still in place Southern Nevada resorts haven’t been able to generate much revenue in their casinos showrooms restaurants and other amenities.

Signs of resurgence

But look at what we have to look forward to in the second half of 2021.

It appears that after a rough start vaccination rates appear to be on track. While having the public receiving their full doses of Pfizer Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines won’t be a cure-all it should instill confidence in people to get back to what they enjoy doing in our resorts.

Casino companies have organized vaccination programs for their employees and even though some may believe they’ve been coerced into doing so by regulators the end result is the same: It’ll convince visitors from afar that Las Vegas is a safe place to go for a good time.

Last week sales representatives from the city’s major casino companies gathered in the Las Vegas Convention Center’s new $989 million West Hall for a panel discussion on the return of the convention business.

The gathering — properly socially distanced with attendees wearing facial coverings — was generally upbeat with journalists from meetings trade publications optimistic about the return of conventions and shows in Las Vegas.

Local elected officials and International Market Centers leaders held a Friday ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the grand opening of the new 315000-square-foot Expo at World Market Center in advance of the five-day Las Vegas Market show.

The event opening Sunday in downtown Las Vegas will be one of the initial events to return since the COVID-19 pandemic started more than a year ago.

In early June the first major trade show and expo — World of Concrete — will make its appearance which should generate some second-quarter revenue for several companies. Representatives of Wynn Resorts Ltd. Caesars Entertainment Inc. Las Vegas Sands Corp. and MGM Resorts International are saying their convention calendars are starting to fill up.

Panelists said their companies have been investing in their products during the time there have been fewer people in their buildings.

Trains planes and automobiles

Attendees of Global Meetings Industry Day were given tours of the new West Hall and media members also got their first look at Elon Musk’s underground people-mover transit system using Tesla electric cars. It’s an attraction that for now is unique to Las Vegas and could draw interest from tourists when The Boring Co. expands the system into the city.

And the recent announcement that Amtrak could return to Las Vegas is welcome news especially to those who have spent untold hours sitting in traffic on Interstate 15 between Southern California and Las Vegas.

Assuming that President Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan includes new side tracks for Amtrak trains to get around priority freight trains a Los Angeles-to-Las Vegas train route could take thousands of cars off the overused highway. Amtrak could also produce some competition for Brightline’s planned high-speed rail project between Southern California and Southern Nevada.

Planes are starting to fill up again as well which is more good news for the city’s resorts.

While first-quarter results for Southwest Airlines and Allegiant Travel Co. aren’t likely to be anything to write home about they’re bound to be a good starting point for the rest of 2021.

Southwest the busiest commercial air carrier at McCarran International Airport and Las Vegas Sands Corp. parent company of The Venetian and the Palazzo are due to be the first to share their earnings with investors toward the end of April.

Both had disappointing fourth quarters but both have expressed optimism in the months ahead.

Southwest’s planes are starting to fill up and the company has announced 17 new destinations including Fresno Palm Springs and Santa Barbara California. The airline also has ordered 100 Boeing 737 MAX jets and will retire the oldest jets in its fleet.

Meanwhile more and more restaurants and entertainment venues are starting to open up to larger crowds. It was announced late last week that the Electric Daisy Carnival will be conducted in May as planned. That huge electronic music festival will bring thousands of people from out of state to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway for three evenings of entertainment.

The only thing that could ruin everything is a setback in COVID-19 cases resulting from overconfident and overexuberent people who refuse to adhere to health guidelines on social distancing and wearing masks.

Investors in publicly traded gaming companies are counting on visitors doing the right thing so that we can all get back to normal.

Assembly Bill 286—which passed out of committee on a party line vote—would ban homemade firearms that lack serial numbers and expand the locations where concealed carry permit holders are legally prohibited from carrying guns.

Debate over these measures—as well as those yet to come—will undoubtedly be an amalgamation of tried-and-tired soundbites from both sides. Conservatives will declare with righteous indignation that the only thing capable of “stopping a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.” Meanwhile gun control advocates will promote statistics about “gun violence” as irrefutable evidence that something must be done to start taking dangerous firearms “off the streets.”

And yet there’s a crucial aspect of the gun control debate that remains conspicuously and tragically under-discussed by both sides: The racial historical and civic relevance of Second Amendment rights.

The last several years of racial and cultural tension have had a predictable effect on firearm ownership that is certain to complicate progressives’ political calculus regarding gun control: More Americans are buying more firearms than ever and minorities are increasingly joining the ranks of first-time gun buyers.

The explosion of firearm ownership among Black Americans especially is something that would make some of the civil rights activists of decades-past beam with pride—and with good reason: Historically gun control has negatively affected disadvantaged communities to a greater extent than white middle-America and gun rights were once integral to the expansion of civil rights.

In fact at one point racial inequities were actually the purpose of gun control laws.

The Black Codes in the post-Civil War South were in part aimed at disarming freed Black slaves. Gun licensing laws registration schemes and even prohibitions on certain models of weapons were used as legal tools to strip African Americans in the deep south of the ability to defend themselves against the terrorist tactics of organizations like the Ku Klux Klan. In the early 20th Century northern states began adopting similar regulatory frameworks as a means of disenfranchising marginalized Italian and German communities.

Obviously gun control activists today aren’t advocating for a return to the racist and prejudiced policies of the Jim Crow South or the anti-Italian sentiments of New York’s Sullivan Act. However better intentions don’t magically erase the disparate impact such laws generate. Like any number of bureaucratic burdens on individual rights it’s not unreasonable to think firearm regulations would disproportionately affect communities that suffer from institutional or social prejudice.

However the inequitable impact of gun control among racial and socioeconomic demographics aren’t blind spots only for progressives. After all the most powerful gun-rights organization in the nation the National Rifle Association often appears less interested in defending the principles of firearm ownership among certain social groups than it is in pandering to political factions within the conservative movement.

Sure the NRA likes to boast about the massive numbers of female and minority gun owners from time to time but it has proven radically unwilling to stand up for those same demographics when doing so might upset its predominantly Republican blue-lives-matter conservative base.

The organization for example was deafeningly quiet when Breonna Taylor’s boyfriend followed the advice of virtually every NRA instructor teaching home defense by confronting unknown intruders in the middle of the night with his firearm. Regrettably the intruders weren’t home invaders they were plain-clothes police officers—and Breonna lost her life as a consequence.

In another high-profile example of police misconduct Philando Castile—a Black man pulled over for a broken taillight—was fatally shot in 2016 by a police officer in Minnesota after he calmly informed officers he was a concealed carry permit holder with a firearm on his person. (Warning: This video of the incident is distressing.) Just as in Breonna’s case and many others the NRA was conspicuously “MIA'' during the national conversation that followed.

And that’s what many conservative gun groups—such as the NRA—get so very wrong about the debate over gun rights: Defending the Second Amendment is about more than constitutional concerns regarding proposed gun laws. Morally and ethically there are significantly more important reasons for defending Second Amendment rights than a run-on sentence authored by admittedly flawed men in the late 1700s.

Firearm rights have historically been minority rights. They’re civil rights. Throughout our nation’s history gun rights have been directly and indirectly married to the progress of racial and social justice. For communities and individuals treated as second-class citizens these rights have literally been a lifeline during times of unrest social change and racial tension.

As Malcom X rightfully pointed out at the height of the civil rights movement the Second Amendment isn’t just about weaponry… It’s about equality.

The concert was one in a series of socially-distanced performances that began in March. These concerts marked the first time the stage has been used since the pandemic forced the closure of the nation’s live entertainment venues more than a year ago.

For Pub Station concerts fans could purchase tickets in groups of four or six and they were separated from others by metal fencing set in a U-shape. Such barriers typically erected at the front of the stage to keep the massive crowds at bay didn’t seem to matter when after more than a year a really loud rock concert was pumping through everyone’s bodies.

“This was the most energetic show I’ve ever played probably because people were hungry for live music and we all fed off each other” said Gildehaus who selected the date specifically to be a countdown—4/3/21—where she dropped a year’s worth of angst into a new anathematic album.

Gildehaus who plays under the name Gilda House was one of several concerts to sell out after the Pub announced it was returning to live music. A sell-out isn’t what it once was however bringing just 100 people into the venue—capacity 800.

Sean Lynch owner and operator of The Pub Station with his wife Ann Kosempa estimates the venue (prior to COVID-19) brought upwards of $24 million annually into the Billings economy and attracted more than 55000 people to downtown for live music or private events.

Lynch has been instrumental in lobbying at a state and national level for funding support for entertainment venues which were the first to close during the onset of the pandemic experiencing a complete loss of revenue and many remain shuttered.

“Billings Montana wants to see national bands and for me to get national bands going I have to do things to help Denver and Minneapolis and all these other surrounding areas get up and running” said Lynch. “If we don’t have those we don’t have anything. This is a national business.”

Lynch is currently the co-chairman of a reopening task force and the chair of the advocacy side of reopening for National Independent Venue Association a group of more than 3000 independent venues across the U.S. NIVA was instrumental in pushing for this funding through their advocacy campaign “Save Our Stages.”

In December that action bore fruit as the SBA announced the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program which allocated more than $16 billion in relief funding to venues performing arts centers theaters museums and qualifying event spaces across the country. Operators can apply for grants of as much as $10 million.

The application portal opened Thursday for venues to apply but was plagued with glitches and shut down shortly after. According to a tweet by the SBA “The portal was shut down to ensure fair and equal access once it is reopened.”

Allocating billions in funding toward such organizations is founded in part by their inability to operate and contribute back to the economies of their communities. Performance venues will be some of the last to open in the nation as their primary objective is to gather large amounts of people together often in close contact to share in a collective experience.

In September 2020 more than $10 million was divvied up to entertainment organizations across Montana from venues to theaters to sports teams. If it was entertaining and had lost most if not all revenue because of the pandemic an infusion of funds from the Live Entertainment Grants was available from the state.

The loss of entertainment revenue in 2020 has been a devastation not yet calculated. Prior to the pandemic the nation’s arts and culture sector was a $919.7 billion industry that supported more than 5 million jobs. That sector including nonprofits commercial arts and education represented 4.3% of the nation’s economy – a 6 percent increase since 2018.

In Montana the arts were a $1.8 billion industry in 2019 representing about 3.4 percent of the Montana economy with 15811 jobs (about 3 percent of employment in the state) according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.

The country’s cries to “get back to work” are being heard and the live music industry is no exception.

Laney Lou and the Bird Dogs a Bozeman-based bluegrass band were the first to reopen the stage in March at the Pub Station and tickets sold so well they added a second show.

“Even if it’s only 100 people allowed in the venue it was getting the bartenders back to their jobs and it got us onstage playing for our fans” said Lena Schiffer frontwoman for the band. “It got us out doing our job and it reminded us why we were a band.”

Those two concerts were the first for Laney Lou and Bird Dogs in a year – with the exception of a couple outdoor shows last summer.

“It’s very strange to count on one hand how many shows you play a year” said Schiffer who estimates the Bird Dogs were playing upwards of 150 shows a year and a good percentage of those dates were on the road.

For Schiffer and the Bird Dogs they’ve been in that all-too-familiar mode of wait-and-see. As the band eyes a summertime tour they are booking dates expecting to have some movement or cancellations.

“We don’t want to put ourselves in a dangerous position but it is all going to come down to timing when everyone feels safe” said Schiffer. “The outdoor venues definitely make us feel better but at the same time we are all ready to get back to our job.”

Montana’s restrictions on gathering together were lifted in early 2021 and there is nothing preventing large events from taking place. But the entertainment industry can’t just spring back into action. There’s a connected web of routes finances and varying guidelines for each state that continue to make a return to live performances very tricky.

“We are really in a hard spot” said Lynch. “The depth of the industry and how intertwined everything is … I could open right now at full capacity but I don’t have anything to give you. Not only do we have to make it financially work but the artist has to also.”

One of the state’s largest performing arts venues Alberta Bair Theater is sitting pretty waiting to unveil a completed $13.6 million renovation to the aging facility in downtown Billings. The irony now is even though they have the infrastructure to host bigger touring acts fans and venue operators will just have to wait.

“Public safety is the first priority” said Jody Grant programming and marketing director for the Alberta Bair Theater. “But in balance with that we have to get actors and performers working again but not at a loss to the theater.”

Booking acts for the theater’s reopening has proven challenging and Grant has rebooked acts as many as five times as guidelines and routes continue to shift. Though Broadway acts are beginning to tour again such productions won’t hit tertiary markets like Billings until spring 2022.

Grant indicated the ABT will operate under CDC guidelines for gathering people together and will begin a series of small shows featuring local musicians to begin to bring the venue back up to its operating capacity.

“At this point we need to test our lights sounds new points of sale and ticketing system” said Grant. “When the virus hit we were in the midst of a $13.6 million renovation.”

Plans are to reopen the theater to full capacity in September with a gala event featuring Kristen Chenoweth on Sept. 18—a date that has been rescheduled three times already.

For Gildehaus playing live music for an audience was a jolt of energy and a reminder of all the reasons she’s a musician.

“I forgot what it felt like to interact with a live audience and see people experience the music in real time while you’re making it” said Gildehaus whose parents and fiancé were front and center for the performance and could easily qualify as her biggest fans. They spent the night singing along with every song dancing and cheering her on.

“My dad was telling me that he really enjoyed his pod because he could dance and be with the people he came with very easily and they had space to dance” said Gildehaus.

As pleasing as it is to have a private pod it’s not a money-maker Lynch admitted.

“At these socially distanced shows we are not making any money but we are not losing money. It’s a wash. You have to start somewhere and we needed to show that we are making forward progress.”

“My level of fame is nothing compared to my son-in-law’s” the progressive rock legend tells me. He means Andrew Lincoln the English actor best known as Rick Grimes in TV zombie thriller The Walking Dead who married his daughter Gael in 2006. “I’ve been an interested observer of his career” Ian continues. “You see how fame affects someone’s life. You’re no longer a private person; in public places streets and restaurants you become fair game.

“He’s very patient and friendly with people who want selfies and autographs even when it gets embarrassing. Luckily where they live there’s no intrusion. He doesn’t get zombie fans at his front door.” Ian 73 – fondly remembered for wearing a cod-piece on stage and standing on one leg to play the flute – has experienced worse. “When I’d become reasonably well-known we had some very undesirable people turning up at our house” he says. “People with criminal records; they were quite threatening to my wife and our son and daughter. We’re fortunate our local media don’t draw attention to where we live now and local folk respect our privacy too.” Home is “in Wiltshire not too far from Swindon. My wife lives not too far from Cirencester… It’s the same house but we refer to it differently.” Ian married second wife Shona a former PR and the cousin of the Duchess of Rutland in 1976. “My wife doesn’t like towns; she likes Waitrose in Cirencester” he grins. “I’m a public transport guy she isn’t. The highlight of our week at the moment is getting masked and gelled and heading to Waitrose for the grocery shopping.”

Ian has used lockdown to complete his first official lyric book Silent Singing

Jethro Tull who took their name from a radical 17th-century agricultural pioneer have released 21 studio albums in their 53-year career including 1971’s multiplatinum Aqualung. Two of their singles Living In The Past and The Witch’s Promise went Top 5. Ian the only constant member still gets mobbed at venues and events.

“I don’t mind selfies as long as people know how to work their cameras. I don’t mind signing either but I draw the line when people turn up with their record collection and expect you to sign the lot in the rain...” Encounters with the public can be risky. He had a pint of urine tipped over his head – possibly by a flute-ophobe – as he waited to play New York’s Shea Stadium and had to perform “stinking of another man’s pee”. Dunfermline-born Ian estimates he has performed fan favourites such as Locomotive Breath live more than 3800 times. Tull’s first gig was at London’s Marquee Club in 1968. Ian’s bug-eyed stage persona quickly caught attention. The one-legged flute-playing was unplanned though. “I used to play the harmonica on one leg and the flute on two but after a reviewer wrote that I played the flute on one leg I dutifully started to do it and it stuck” he chuckles.

“I play naked under the cod-piece... I’ve had to replace it several times. I had a collection but they’ve all gone. They were in a drawer until about 10 years ago

and have mysteriously disappeared. My wife denies any involvement... “My rather sexy stage tights vanished too – and they were designed for me by the costumier of the Royal Ballet.” He has no memorabilia at home. “I’ve had gold albums and other material demonstrations of your greatness but they’re not something I need to see every day. They’ve mostly gone to charity auctions. “I regret not having the old overcoat my father gave me. It was stolen from our dressing room in Detroit on our first US tour in 1969.” One of his stage outfits is on display in the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame “on a mannequin of me next to one of Rod Stewart” he grumbles. “I don’t know if they shrink the clothes when they clean them but we look like two very tiny men! It makes us look shorter than Keith Richards.” At 5ft 10in Ian is two inches taller. As a child growing up in Blackpool Ian wanted to become a fighter pilot “then reality prevailed and I realised I wasn’t made of that heroic stuff although I did try and enrol as a police cadet.

They were interested until I told them I had O-levels. Just as well as I have sensitive skin and those rough trousers would have chaffed and I’d have had to be excused boots.” He tried journalism too “but the Blackpool Gazette showed me the door”. Ian accepts the “prog rock” tag reluctantly. “Prog isn’t a term I use because it became synonymous with bombast and indulgence after 1972 with Peter Gabriel dressed as a giant sunflower... it became a little bit silly. I considered us to be progressive rock.” His songs are complex with odd time signatures and folky harmonies. Some are self-mocking others address social issues but he says “I’m singing as the character not myself – much as in the thespian world the singer has to take on roles too. Too many make it all about themselves we’re supposed to be interested in their grotty lives.” The fruits of Ian’s labours include an 18th-century estate largely set in 500 rolling acres of woodland. “We’ve planted 25000 trees over 15 years and we will plant another 10000 hardwood trees mostly oak trees – this was once part of an oak forest.”

His most unusual possession is a handgun from a James Bond film – “a Walther P88 with the serial number 007 and a horrible trigger pull”. Ian has performed at the world’s most prestigious venues from Carnegie Hall to historic amphitheatres and plays fund-raising Christmas shows in churches and cathedrals to help restoration work. Bradford Cathedral has the best acoustics he says but “St Paul’s and Liverpool aren’t workable the architects should have been shot”. He has 64 concerts scheduled for this year “which could happen – including an outdoor show in summer and a UK tour in September”. He’s used lockdown to complete his first official lyric book Silent Singing (out in July) and to play remotely on albums by Yes’s Jon Anderson (no relation) and Marc Almond. Ian will work with unknown artists too. “If it’s out of my comfort zone I’ll do it. I like to be challenged even if it’s not my cup of tea.

According to Breaking Defense Lockheed’s new Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) has ranges from 60 to 499 kilometers (37 to 310 miles). Two PrSMs will fit inside the rocket pod of a USMC High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HiMARS).

According to Lockheed Martin’s Precision Strike Missile’s page the 156-inch (13 feet/4 meters) long and 17-inch (1.4 feet/0.4 meter) PrSM is designed for survivability using Advanced Global Positioning System (GPS) updates that can work in a degraded environment for flight control guidance. The PrSM’s optimized warhead uses preformed fragments to maximize lethality and area blast coverage on the target (such as in an airburst fashion). The nosecone has available space to mount seeker heads at a future date to track both land and sea targets.

Lockheed video screenshot showing a HiMARS with two expended PrSMs per launch pod. A HiMARS can carry one launch pod an U.S. Army MLRS can carry two pods or four PrSMs.

According to Breaking Defense’s article the U.S. Army wants the PrSM to fly out even further perhaps out to 500-1100 miles (804-1770 kilometers) with further future upgrades.

AUSA Warriors Corner 2019 on Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) had a Powerpoint slide statement that read:

“The Precision Strike Missile is a long-range missile fired from existing launcher platforms with greater range lethality and survivability at a lower cost than the legacy MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). The ATACMS missile has a length of 13 feet (4 meters) and a larger diameter of 24 inches (610 mm) and flies at Mach 3+ out to targets from 80 miles (128 km) to 190 miles (300 km) depending on Block configuration.”

At the AUSA Global Force Next 2021’s presentation on Long Range Precision Fires the representative for Fires/Combat Maneuver Systems Tactical and Strike Missiles Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control said that the company has 30 years of performance data on ATACMS (ATACMS was first fielded in 1991) that allows Lockheed to model the flight characters and predict the effectiveness of the Precision Strike Missile. The use of 3D printers has allowed for a faster production although the Lockheed representative admitted that COVID-19 has affected and slowed the progress of all the Defense suppliers.

Naval News comments

“Link Joint shooters to the right command and control node […] Small units will need to be able to operate on their own […] [The U.S. Army remains relevant in the INDO-PACOM region to] Provide options for the Combatant Commanders for MDO [Multi-Domain Operations]. The Multi-Domain Task Force will provide LRPFs Cyber space and deterrence…Hypersonic Air Defense etc.”



General James C. McConville Chief of Staff of the Army at Virtual AUSA Global Force Next 2021

“Focus on competition. How to maintain an edge so that we can compete every day every week?”



General David H. Berger 38th Commandant of the Marine Corps at Virtual Marine Corps Expo 2020

Alluding to U.S. Army General James McConville’s comments if the U.S. Marine Corps is to operate as independent small units as envisioned by USMC General David Berger HiMARS armed with PrSMs would be instrumental in a land attack and Anti-ship role especially if the missile’s range is increased to 310-1100 miles (500-1770 km) and the nosecones are fitted with an advanced seeker that can track moving targets. A missile that has a dual-functional method of seeking and tracking both moving land and sea targets would mean that one or a few HiMARS can effectively deter a broader assortment of moving enemy threats and can provide much better effective deterrence than the existing PrSM that just uses advanced GPS guidance against stationary targets and currently has no seeker to target moving enemy targets.

U.S. Navy hovercrafts Landing Crafts and Light Amphibious Warships (LAW) would not have to beach and unload the HiMARS if the PrSM’s long range is enough to reach out and fire from the ship itself such as from the helicopter flight deck as demonstrated from the flight deck of the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ship USS Anchorage (LPD 23) during Dawn Blitz 2017 Oct. 22 or the flight deck of the upcoming LAW. (See photos below). 300+ miles is more than the 100 nautical mile range (115mi/185 kilometers) of the Naval Strike Missile and more than the 150 nmi (172mi/280 km) Harpoon.

If the U.S. Army and Lockheed can manufacturer the PrSM variant with increased range and possess an advanced seeker head that tracks moving targets such a PrSM might alleviate the twenty-five percent budget cut that the U.S. Marine Corps sustained in researching and developing LRPF Ground-Based Anti-ship Missiles.

“The High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) was fired from the flight deck of the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ship USS Anchorage (LPD 23) during Dawn Blitz 2017 Oct. 22.” [Author: With a missile range of 310 to possibly even 1100 miles (500-1770 km) a single or a few USMC HiMARS can expand the defense deterrence radius to fire from the amphibious ship or LAW itself without even having to close in and land HiMARS on shore.

ARLINGTON Texas – On behalf of a grateful Nation the Army & Air Force Exchange Service and The United States of America Vietnam War Commemoration will honor four Vietnam Veterans during an on-field ceremony Nov. 6 at the Lockheed Martin Commanders’ Classic presented by USAA.



During the Army vs. Air Force football game at Globe Life Field in Arlington Exchange Director/CEO Tom Shull and retired Maj. Gen. Pete Aylward director of the Vietnam War Commemoration will present Vietnam Veteran Lapel Pins to:



• Army Sgt. Glen Copeland of Ennis Texas.

• Marine Corps Sgt. James Painter of Wolfe City Texas.

• Navy Seaman Don Foster of Arlington.

• Air Force Lt. Col. Dennis Haessig of Arlington.



“We are honored to partner with the Vietnam War Commemoration to give our heroes the thanks they so rightly deserve” said Shull an Army Veteran who served during the Vietnam War period. “The ceremony at Globe Life Field provides a great opportunity to honor four heroes from the past in front of the West Point and Air Force Cadets who will be at the game.”



The United States of America Vietnam War Commemoration is administered by the Office of the Secretary of Defense to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War. The Commemoration was authorized by Congress established under the Secretary of Defense and launched by the President in 2012. It will continue through Veterans Day 2025.



“These four heroes—a Soldier Airman Marine and Sailor—made selfless sacrifices for all Americans” Aylward said. “They represent all Vietnam Veterans—our Nation’s blood and treasure from a generation ago—who never received the gratitude and respect they so richly deserve. This Vietnam Veteran Lapel Pin is a lasting memento of our Nation’s thanks.”



For Copeland the on-field honor will represent only the second time he has been publicly recognized for his service in Vietnam. The first was decades ago when he received the Army Commendation Medal with V device.



“Vietnam Veterans were not treated well when they came home” said Copeland who was drafted in 1966 and served one tour in Vietnam. “I was one of the lucky ones who didn’t dwell on this. I went and did what I had to do and came home.”



This on-field moment he said isn’t just about him. It’s about all who served during the Vietnam era.



“I wish all Veterans could receive this for their service” Copeland said.



The Exchange has been a Commemorative Partner with the Vietnam War Commemoration since 2013 planning and conducting events and activities that recognize Vietnam Veterans and their families. Since 2018 the Exchange has honored Vietnam Veterans with commemorative lapel pins in ceremonies at stores around the world on March 29 National Vietnam War Veterans Day.



The Exchange is a supporter of Army West Point Sports and Air Force Athletics. The Army Black Knights will battle against the Air Force Falcons at Globe Life Field marking the first time the game has been played at a neutral location. The service academies have faced off on the football field every year since 1971.

PANAGYURISHTE (BM) – Criticism of the American stealth fighter of the fifth-generation F-35 does not stop -on international and local level. The future is unclear but analysts say the F-35 is becoming an unsalvageable project.

Adam Smith said strong words in early March this year. According to him Washington and the American taxpayer continue to spend on something that has “such low capabilities.” Adam Smith is not an accidental man – he is the chairman of the US Armed Forces Committee.

The prestigious American publication The Hill even called the F-35 a “broken weapon.” Of course back in 1990 this was not the idea of ​​the US military. They wanted a plane to replace the tired F-16 and A-10 horses – the symbol of the American struggle during the Cold War with the USSR. The F-35 had to be low-end with high strategic efficiency. This symbol of American military technology had to build a small but resilient and effectively deadly fleet. But it wouldn’t.

When you are constantly upgrading a system with new technologies when you are continually giving it higher expectations – sooner or later it will fall to the ground and the impact effect will affect everything around it. From 2001 until today the F-35 is the “experienced bunny” of Lockheed Martin. And what did this lead to? High costs and delays. Since then acquisition costs have been $ 428 billion which should have been twice as low at about $ 240 billion.

However these figures are too small compared to $ 1.727 trillion – estimated operating and maintenance costs. Congratulations to the winners (Lockheed Martin) and welcome to the losers’ dark zone (the American taxpayer).

History remembers but people are silent

It would not be correct to think for a moment that the problems of the F-35 have arisen in the last two or three years. That is why we the media remind the citizens of what the politicians said what they promised and what they did not fulfill.

As early as April 2016 John McCain said that the F-35 was a scandalously tragic project especially in cost planning and execution. Let’s go back to 2014 when Frank Kendall said the F-35 was abusing the acquisition. At the time Kendall was not another critical senator but a Secretary of Defense.

In 2019 both we as a media outlet and several others worldwide published a terrible report on the fighter’s deplorable condition. 873 unresolved shortcomings? 873! Of all these 873 shortcomings 13 were in category 1 – especially important and too severe to imagine that such a loudly advertised F-35 could have them.

And if you think that in 2019 these facts were clear then you are sorely mistaken. A year earlier in 2018 the figure was 917 unresolved shortcomings and 15 of category 1. I.e. in one year the American taxpayer has given the state and the defense respectively billions of dollars. Still Lockheed Martin and the military have solved only 44 shortcomings and 2 of category 1.

“Cul-de-sac” or No exit road

Charles Brown Chief of General Staff of the US Air Force today the F-35 is like a sports Ferrari – you don’t go to work with it all day but only on Sundays and not everyone.

The problems of the F-35 are complex. But the main problem is upgrading technology during production. I.e. when a problem is identified the manufacturer must return those already manufactured to correct the problem which significantly exceeds the maintenance costs of the aircraft itself. But you can’t leave an already manufactured aircraft with an existing issue discovered during the production of a new version.

The worst is not over – it is coming. Although the plane showed poor results despite all the problems known to be criticized “killing these flocks” is impossible. Why? The lobby.

Hawaii and North Dakota are the only states that do not have senators lobbying on Lockheed Martin’s behalf. You don’t cut the branch you’re sitting on do you?

Here's What You Need to Remember: Despite the platform’s success the United States Air Force opted to retire the F-117 in April 2008. The Air Force ultimately retired the Nighthawk as a cost-saving measure as the service struggled to pay for the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor.

It was an aircraft that may have simply been ahead of its time. The Lockheed Martin F-117 Nighthawk was the first operational aircraft to be designed around stealth technology and while commonly referred to as a “stealth fighter” it was actually a ground attack aircraft. The platform was developed during the late 1970s in response to an Air Force request for an aircraft that would be capable of attacking high-value targets without being detected by enemy radar.

New materials and techniques developed during the “space race” allowed engineers to design the aircraft with radar-evading “stealth capabilities.”

Earlier this month one F-117 headed to the Palm Springs Air Museum where it became part of the permanent collection. The fact that one of the aircraft is heading to the museum is notable as this is only the fourth F-117A to end up as a museum exhibit. One other aircraft named “Midnight Rider” arrived this August at Hill Aerospace Museum in Utah in August while “Unexpected Guest” was expected to be displayed at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library this year. “Shaba” will also be transported to the Kalamazoo Air Zoo Museum in Michigan for restoration and future display.

Four of the prototype aircraft are displayed at various museums and military bases. The first prototype/test aircraft was presented to Nellis Air Force Base Nevada in 1992 and became the first F-117 to be made a “gate guardian.”

The second prototype was delivered to the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB outside of Dayton Ohio in July 1991; while the third prototype is now at Holloman AFB New Mexico. That aircraft which was painted to resemble the first F-117A to drop weapons in combat was also the first to be revealed to high-ranking officials at Groom Lake in December 1983 which was also the first semi-public unveiling of the aircraft.

The fourth prototype was previously at Blackbird Airpark Museum in Palmdale California but it is undergoing restoration work and will be displayed at the Air Force Flight Test Center Museum at Edwards AFB sometime next year.

History of the F-117

The F-117 had its first flight in June 1981 at Groom Lake Nevada while the first F-117A unit the 4450th Tactical Group (renamed the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing in October 1989) achieved initial operating capability in October 1983. Of the sixty-four F-117s built between 1981 and 1990 fifty-nine were production versions.

In 1989 the F-117A was awarded the Collier Trophy one of the most prized aeronautical awards in the world.

The F-117A first saw combat just months later when two from the 37th TFW were used in Operation Just Cause on Dec. 19 1989 against military targets in Panama. The aircraft was used in the Persian Gulf War when the 415th and the 416th squadrons of the 37th TFW were deployed to Saudi Arabia. During Operation Desert Storm the F-117As flew 1271 sorties achieving an 80 percent mission success rate and suffered no losses or battle damage.

The ground attack aircraft were used in a conflict in Yugoslavia where one was shot down by surface-to-air missiles in 1999 the only Nighthawk to be lost in combat. This occurred on March 27 1999 when an S-125M missile crew from the Serbian 250th Air Defense Missile Brigade fired two missile V-600 missiles at the aircraft when it was flying back to its base in Italy after bombing a military target outside of Belgrade. Named “Something Wicked” its remains are on display at the Museum of Aviation in the Serbian capital city.

Despite the platform’s success the United States Air Force opted to retire the F-117 in April 2008. The Air Force ultimately retired the Nighthawk as a cost-saving measure as the service struggled to pay for the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. At the time the Air Force claimed that the advent of the air superiority-oriented Raptor—and eventually the F-35—meant it no longer needed the F-117.

While the aircraft has been officially retired a portion of the fleet has been kept airworthy and as noted few museums have even been provided with the airframe. So while unlikely it is possible the F-117 Nighthawk could get a chance to fly again. Until then the best way to see this early cutting-edge aircraft is in a museum.

Mullen chair of the Cornell Progressives’ Anti-War Committee hopes to introduce a resolution to the Student Assembly later this week that would encourage the University to terminate all Cornell partnerships with institutions in Saudi Arabia disclose all grants and donations from Saudi Arabian institutions and the investment of such funds into organizations fighting for the Yemeni people.

Mullen also called for the immediate end of Cornell Engineering’s corporate partnerships with arms manufacturers and barring these corporations from recruiting at Cornell. Companies with these partnerships include Northrop Grumman Boeing Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems. More broadly Mullen wants Cornell to publicly condemn the war in Yemen and cease business with any company profiting from the war.

Mullen alleged that Saudi Arabia has committed a variety of war atrocities including bombing school buses and hospitals blockading Yemen and exacerbating a famine that is starving civilians.

In 2008 Cornell won a $25 million grant from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology. In 2018 professors and faculty asked the University to disclose all donations from Saudi Arabia and end any partnerships with the regime but according to Mullen this request was never fulfilled.

Because of the impact of the blockade and Saudi Arabia’s bombing of Yemeni medical facilities Mullen considers the Saudi Arabian government fitting of divestment.

”If a nation or a company is engaging in genocide that should meet the qualification for divestment or disengagement” Mullen said.

Mullen also criticized Cornell Engineering’s partnerships with corporations that sell weapons to the Saudi government. Specifically he pointed to Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems who partner with Cornell Engineering in graduate programs for current employees to get a masters degree. On top of that Lockheed Martin donated $63000 to Cornell Engineering for undergraduate student research projects workshops design teams and peer-mentor programming.

This proposed resolution continues the trend of the Student Assembly’s involvement in Cornell’s international affairs. Last week the SA passed Resolution 39 which called on Cornell to uphold ethical guidelines when collaborating with international institutions specifically with the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University in China.

Mullen’s resolution is intended to continue the Student Assembly’s goal of ensuring ethical collaboration with foreign governments.

‘“We are at a critical point now because the Biden administration has announced that they will stop support for the Saudi coalition” Mullen said. “In 2018 [Cornell] failed to take action. Now more than ever we have to.”"

Where there once stood a historic Seattle ballpark land that’s now home to the Rainier Valley Lowe’s hardware store may soon be leveled once again to make way for an Amazon distribution facility.

Despite being re-zoned to accommodate dense affordable housing and small businesses concept documents filed with the City this week suggest that the Lowe’s property on Rainier Avenue South could soon host a 68000 square-foot distribution center and a small ocean of parking spaces. The Pepsi plant north of Lowe’s is also part of the proposed reconstruction and it appears as though a deal with Amazon would involve the use of both properties.

Though Amazon has made no official announcement about interest in the properties acronyms used in both plans submitted to the City reference Amazon. The site of the potential facility is poised just one block from the Mount Baker light rail station.

Development of a distribution center and a parking lot full of vans in lieu of the high rise housing the area was zoned for would have major repercussions for the Mount Baker neighborhood and constitute an enormous setback towards efforts to make it more accessible and affordable. As Doug Trumm of The Urbanist reports if developed with density in mind the Pepsi and Lowe’s properties could provide upwards of 6000 new housing units many of which could accommodate entire families.

The City rezoned the Lowe’s property to a height of 145 feet for the express purpose of encouraging highrise development which would not only make for ample housing but also pump upwards of $100 million into the City’s Mandatory Housing Affordability (MHA) trust fund. Conversely development of a distribution center would grant the fund a net $0 since the distribution center would likely be classed an industrial property exempt from MHA according to Trumm’s article. This means that while Amazon would avoid MHA payments on these properties smaller commercial businesses in the area would still be required to pay.

A third property is also in play: a 7-acre parcel in Interbay which formerly housed a Northwestern Industries glass manufacturing plant. If located here a distribution center would clock in at over 100000 square-feet and feature similar amenities to the proposed Rainier Avenue facility. None of the three properties however are publicly listed for sale.

The Lowe’s site is also a cultural landmark for the city. From 1938 to 1977 the Rainier Avenue property was the home of Sicks’ Stadium a former Seattle sports venue which famously hosted Rainiers baseball games and numerous concerts. Jimi Hendrix’s final Seattle show was performed at Sicks’ in 1970 and by 1979 the park was demolished. A two-story building was erected in its place shortly afterward and Lowe’s has occupied the space since 1991.

Amazon is also currently a tenant in the Lowe’s building as they utilize an upstairs office for promotional operations.

A chance to be in the majors without the daily uncertainty of being sent back to the minors. And to be in the lineup on a regular basis with the opportunity to make the requisite daily adjustments.

It had become increasingly clear he wasn’t going to get that with the Rays who had given him 219 at-bats over five stints in 2019-20 during which he hit .251 with 11 homers 30 RBIs and a .770 OPS and played so-so at best defense at first.

The Rays decided in December they would keep Ji-Man Choi — and his four-plus-times higher salary — and traded Lowe to the Rangers for three low-level albeit intriguing minor leaguers (Heriberto Hernandez Osleivis Basabe Alexander Ovalles).

And like other things in Texas the opportunity for Lowe was bigger.

Lowe has started each of the Rangers’ first seven games with hits and RBIs in the first five. He went into play Friday — where none of the Rangers did anything as they got no-hit by San Diego’s Joe Musgrove — leading the majors with 14 RBIs.

Of note he was only the third player in modern history to knock in 14 runs in his team’s first five games — joining Chris Davis (17 for the 2013 Orioles) and Bobby Doerr (14 for the 1941 Red Sox).

“It’s exciting man” Lowe said Friday by phone from Texas. “It’s great to see some results right off the bat instead of having to wait around and feel for it and hoping to add it.”

Lowe said the Rangers made it clear after the trade they planned to give him an opportunity and followed through starting him four times at first base and three at DH batting him in the middle of the order.

“They’ve been so positive for me they’ve been so good about telling me you’re going to get a shot to contribute you’re going to be a guy that helps the offense” he said. “Fortunately I’ve been able to run with it.”

That run brings Lowe back to Tropicana Field next as the Rangers open a four-game series with the Rays on Monday.

Lowe 25 said he is looking forward to it. Not to gloat but to say hello to the players coaches athletics trainers and staff he’s known since 2016 when he was a 13th-round pick.

And in a way to thank them for giving him the chance to get an opportunity elsewhere.

“That’s just one of the positives that could be a negative of being in an organization so deep talent-wise” Lowe said. “It goes to show guys who may not be everyday players in Tampa (Bay) deserve a shot to be everyday guys elsewhere.

“So it looks good on Tampa it looks good on Texas and it looks good on me.”

Lowe whose younger brother Josh is a Rays outfield prospect currently working out at the alternate training site in Port Charlotte said he’s not into looking for revenge. But getting a few more hits and adding to his hot start would be okay too.

“Definitely would not mind” he said.

Short stops

• Given the number of bullpen injuries the Rays’ commitment to stick to their plan to develop young power arms such as Shane McClanahan and Luis Patino as starters is to be either further admired or questioned.

• If there can be a rugged early part of the schedule this is it: Friday opened a stretch of 36 games in 38 days for the Rays including nine against the Yankees seven vs. the A’s and series with the Astros Angels Jays and Mets.

• Shortly before taking leave from the team to get “time away from the game” reliever Ryan Sherriff said he was talking extensively with Justin Su’a head of mental performance about going into that field after he’s done playing.

Rays rumblings

Forbes’ annual franchise valuations pegged the Rays at $1.055 billion 29th overall and the only team to not go up from 2020 with annual revenues of $112 million (19th-most) and a 2020 operating loss of $23 million (tied for third lowest). Officials with several teams typically dispute the findings. …. Player rep Tyler Glasnow said the athletic training staff is “doing a good job” arranging COVID-19 vaccine shots for those who want them with the 85-percent standard for relaxed protocols in sight. … Friday also opened a stretch of 17 of 23 games at the Trop (including 11 when the Blue Jays are also “home” in Dunedin). … Best wishes to now former communications VP Dave Haller who moves to the northern Virginia area to join a family landscaping/patio business after 14 years dealing with occasionally rock-headed media … Normally hyperactive outfielder Brett Phillips on how he handled being idled for weeks recovering from a hamstring strain: “You can only imagine right?” … Principal owner Stuart Sternberg was on the Bally Sports telecast during Friday’s fourth-inning rally and did a good job making “the call” of Brandon Lowe’s bases-clearing double. Sternberg heaped praise on the job broadcasters Dewayne Staats and Brian Anderson do saying they know “it’s a relief and a comfort and a lot of joy for all of our fans” to hear them call the games. … Gio Llorena left his post as the Rays chaplain to move to North Carolina with D.J. Springman the former coach at Indian Rocks Christian taking over. …. Catcher Deivy Grullon claimed off waivers from the Reds was an interesting pickup at a low acquisition cost with 42 homers in 198 games over his last minor-league seasons. … Among even more former Rays early signs for an Alex Cobb renaissance after being traded from the Orioles to Angels are good with his mix of splitter curveball and a fastball back to 92-94 mph: “Kind of like the stuff you saw at the Trop a few years ago” Angels manager Joe Maddon said. “Same competitive guy. Good influence on others. A pleasure to be around him again.”

This year will see a record 2 billion people head to the polls in elections spanning some 50 countries so there are concerns around the influence that AI will have among voters — particularly those in “vulnerable communities” that may be more susceptible to take what they see at face value.

The rise of generative AI including wildly popular chatbots such as ChatGPT has led to a major new threat landscape involving AI-generated “deepfakes” designed to perpetuate disinformation. It doesn’t help that these new tools are available widely and enable anyone to create fake videos photos or audio of high-profile political entities.

As recently as Monday India’s Election Commission urged political parties to avoid using deepfakes and similar disinformation in their online campaigns around the elections.

It’s against this backdrop that all the major tech companies including Microsoft and OpenAI have signed voluntary pledges to counter such risks as well as made plans to build a common framework to address deepfakes created explicitly to mislead voters.

Elsewhere major AI companies have started to address these risks by introducing restrictions in their software. For example Google has said it won’t allow its Gemini AI chatbot to answer questions about elections while Facebook’s parent Meta is also limiting election-related responses via its AI chatbot.

Earlier today OpenAI launched a new deepfake detector for disinformation researchers designed to help identify fake content generated by its own DALL-E image generator while it also joined the steering committee for industry body the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) which already counts members such as Adobe Microsoft Google and Intel.

The new “societal resilience fund” forms part of this broader “responsible” AI push with Microsoft and OpenAI now striving to “further AI education and literacy among voters and vulnerable communities” according to a blog post the companies published today. This would involve issuing grants to a handful of organizations including Older Adults Technology Services (OATS) the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA) and Partnership on AI (PAI).

According to Microsoft these grants are intended to create a better understanding of AI and its capabilities across society. For instance OATS will apparently use its grant for training programs aimed at those aged 50 and over in the U.S. covering the “foundational aspects of AI.”

“The launch of the Societal Resilience Fund is just one step that represents Microsoft and OpenAI’s commitment to address the challenges and needs in the AI literacy and education space” Teresa Hutson Microsoft’s corporate VP for technology and corporate responsibility said in the blog post. “Microsoft and OpenAI will remain dedicated to this work and we will continue to collaborate with organizations and initiatives that share our goals and values.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9ha2FtYWktY29uZmlybXMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tb2Ytbm9uYW1lLWZvci00NTBtL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9ha2FtYWktY29uZmlybXMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tb2Ytbm9uYW1lLWZvci00NTBtL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Akamai confirms acquisition of Noname for $450M,"A couple of weeks ago TechCrunch broke the news that Akamai was in discussions to acquire Noname Security a specialist in API security for around $500 million. Today the deal has been confirmed though at a slightly lower price. Akamai on Tuesday said it has agreed to buy Noname in a $450 million deal.

The deal underscores the ongoing push for more consolidation in the cybersecurity market. The last several years have seen the emergence of a wide variety of cybersecurity startups. But a number of these companies have found it hard to scale raise money or sell to customers that are looking for one-stop shops to manage multiple security needs so bigger players are picking up the smaller and more promising of these.

Sometimes that is at a steep discount. Noname was valued at $1 billion at its last private fundraise in December 2021 so it is selling for less than half that price tag.

This is not even the worst discount though: Wiz was in advanced discussions to acquire Lacework Security for $168 million a sight less than the smaller company’s previous valuation of $8.3 billion. That deal fell through in due diligence however.

Akamai said it will be integrating Noname into its API Security business and that it expects the acquisition to deliver approximately $20 million of revenue in its fiscal year 2024.

“Applications run our world but as applications and users proliferate so do security risks” Mani Sundaram EVP and general manager Security Technology Group Akamai Technologies said in a statement. “Akamai has seen a growing need for API protection with our own data showing 109% year over year growth in API attacks. With the addition of Noname Akamai believes it will have the breadth of integrations and deployment choices needed to deliver comprehensive API protection for customers across all environments.”

Akamai’s focus the company said is on providing more tools to developers and security operations teams to discover “shadow” APIs as well as other vulnerabilities.

The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024.

“API development continues to proliferate as customers prioritize their investments in application modernization and digital transformation initiatives” Oz Golan chief executive officer and co-founder of Noname said in a statement. “Combining Noname with Akamai’s API Security offering will provide a solution for any type of customer. No matter where the customer’s applications reside — be it in the cloud natively on the edge on-premise or on other vendor platforms — they will be protected.”

Golan and the rest of the San Jose company’s 200 employees are expected to join Akamai as part of the deal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9ob25leWNvbWItaW5zdXJhbmNlLTM2bS1zZXJpZXMtYi1mcm9tLXNvbG8tdmMtemVldi12ZW50dXJlcy_SAWJodHRwczovL3RlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDcvaG9uZXljb21iLWluc3VyYW5jZS0zNm0tc2VyaWVzLWItZnJvbS1zb2xvLXZjLXplZXYtdmVudHVyZXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Honeycomb Insurance grabs $36M Series B from solo VC-led Zeev Ventures,"When Itai Ben-Zaken’s first startup failed in 2018 the former BCG consultant and Wharton MBA spent months trying to understand what he could have done differently during the five years he ran the company.

After analyzing most of his major decisions he concluded that while Comprendi a digital ad recommendation business was an interesting offering its biggest mistake was trying to operate in a market with two dominant players: Google and Facebook.

So when Ben-Zaken started exploring founding his second startup he vowed not to repeat the same mistake. He looked to start a business in a market divided among many competitors eventually settling on building a company that offers property and casualty insurance for landlords and condo associations.

The largest carrier in landlord insurance — Travelers — represented only about 7% of the market and the rest of the competitive landscape was distributed among 100 smaller providers Ben-Zaken told TechCrunch.

Ben-Zaken wasn’t a stranger to insurance. Before starting Comprendi he spent four years running Insurance.com at QuinStreet an operator of white-labeled financial services marketplaces.

He launched Honeycomb Insurance in 2019 and after spending two years building the company’s computer vision and AI-driven property “inspection” technology the company sold its first policy in 2021. Ben-Zaken says that Honeycomb’s AI relies on aerial photographs of building roofs often eliminating the need for costly physical inspections.

The company raised a $15 million Series A in early 2022 and is currently on track to sell $130 million of insurance premiums in 2024 a threefold increase from last year.

When Honeycomb was gearing up to raise its Series B earlier this year one of the first calls Ben-Zaken made was to solo venture capitalist Oren Zeev who’s known for being one of the largest shareholders in Navan Houzz Next Insurance and Tipalti.

“I was blown away by what I saw” Zeev said about Honeycomb. He agreed to back Honeycomb but only if Ben-Zaken would agree not to market the deal to other investors.

Ben-Zaken didn’t think twice about Zeev’s proposal: He dreamed of having the solo VC as his backer and on Honeycomb’s board since he founded the company.

Zeev wrote a $30 million check to Honeycomb making him the company’s largest shareholder. Other participants in the $36 million Series B that the Chicago-based startup is announcing on Tuesday include new investors Arkin Holdings and Launchbay Capital and returning backers Ibex Investors Phoenix Insurance and IT-Farm.

Zeev too is not a stranger to the insurtech space — he holds a large stake in Next Insurance and was a backer of Hippo Insurance before it went public via a SPAC in 2021 — but he said he is not generally “a fan” of the sector.

“I was not looking for another investment in insurance” he told TechCrunch. “The bar is very high because I am aware of the challenges.”

Besides the company’s fast growth what attracted Zeev to Honeycomb is that landlord insurance is a “sleepy” industry ready for innovation but also the sector is not large enough for insurance giants to want to tackle it. In other words Zeev isn’t worried that major players will encroach on Honeycomb’s territory as they did on Ben-Zaken’s first startup.

According to Ben-Zaken the landlord and condo association insurance market continues to be highly fragmented. He says there are two startups in the space: Steadily which raised a $28.5 million Series B last July and Obie which closed on a $25.5 million Series B from Battery Ventures a year ago.

Honeycomb will use its new funding to double its headcount from 90 to 180 employees over the next 18 months introduce new products and expand its offerings to new markets.

“We are planning to go beyond landlord insurance” Ben Zaken said adding that his company’s goal is to be a one-stop shop for commercial real estate insurance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tdXNpYy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjQvbWF5LzA1L2ZyZWUtbWFkb25uYS1jb25jZXJ0LWRyYXdzLWNyb3dkLW9mLTE2bS10by1icmF6aWxzLWNvcGFjYWJhbmEtYmVhY2jSAXlodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vbXVzaWMvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDI0L21heS8wNS9mcmVlLW1hZG9ubmEtY29uY2VydC1kcmF3cy1jcm93ZC1vZi0xNm0tdG8tYnJhemlscy1jb3BhY2FiYW5hLWJlYWNo?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Free Madonna concert draws crowd of 1.6m to Brazil’s Copacabana beach,"With the world-famous statue towering over it from Corcovado mountain Rio de Janeiro is well used to Christ the Redeemer. For one night only this weekend it also had Madonna.

More than a million people thronged Copacabana beach on Saturday night turning its vast stretch of sand into a massive dancefloor for a free concert by the pop star as she completed her world tour.

“Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world” Madonna 65 told the tightly packed crowd. Pointing out the ocean view and the mountains she added: “This place is magic.”

In the run-up to the concert the city had been buzzing with fans lined up outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in the hope of catching a glimpse of the star. The city’s airport fielded an estimated 170 extra flights as fans poured in from around the world.

City officials estimated that 1.6 million people turned up for the concert some watching from brightly lit apartments or hotels overlooking the beach while others looked on from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.

As drones and helicopters flew overhead the singer offered up a dazzling show playing classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycling through dozens of sets and costume changes.

Flanked by giant screens she began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd.

“Oi Rio!” she called out in Portuguese. The response was swift carried by more than a million voices: “Oi Queen Madonna!”

The singer also paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to Aids as she sang Live to Tell against a backdrop of black-and-white photos featuring people who died from the illness.

The Brazilian pop artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar as well as younger musicians from samba schools also took part in the show.

The show which Madonna’s official website described as the biggest ever in her 40-year career marked the final stop on her Celebration tour. Giant screens and 18 sound towers had been spread out along the beach to ensure the crowds could enjoy the event.

Fans many of whom lined up hours or even days before the concert to get a good view hailed Madonna’s performance. “I have never seen such a powerful show” one told the BBC. “It’s unimaginable very much out of the ordinary” she added.

“Madonna is spectacular” said another. “There’s no concert better than Madonna’s.”

City officials on high alert after a young Brazilian fan died at a Taylor Swift concert last year as a result of heat exhaustion ordered firefighters to cool down fans by spraying water before the concert. Free drinking water was also handed out as temperatures hovered at about 27C (81F) during the late-night show.

More than 3000 police officers were deployed around the concert area where the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have also drawn million-strong crowds.

Across Rio anticipation had been building all week. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city while bars and restaurants served up “Like a Virgin” cocktails. Across the Copacabana neighbourhood the singer’s image was emblazoned on billboards souvenirs and T-shirts.

As hotel bookings in Copacabana climbed to an estimated 98% of capacity Rio state’s security readied plans that included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby while the country’s navy carried out inspections of any vessel looking to follow the concert offshore. City officials estimated that the concert would inject as much as 293m reais (£46m) into the local economy.

At the time she was running for a seat in the New Mexico state legislature. Her mission was to bring Indigenous culture and values as a Diné (Navajo) and Tsétsêhéstâhese (Cheyenne) woman into the political sphere. Though she didn’t end up winning that mission has persisted in her work on among other things the Seven Generations New Deal.

The film was created by photographer and videographer Josué Rivas (Mexica and Otomi) whose work showcases contemporary Indigenous identity in the U.S.

Both leaders in their respective fields June and Rivas took to Grist’s Instagram account earlier this week to discuss their work what drives them and what they have learned from each other. In these excerpts from that conversation they discuss their process in creating the film together and June shares about her current research on Indigenous food systems. Watch the full conversation on Grist’s Instagram.

This is one of a series of Instagram Live conversations between members of this year’s Grist 50 list and the people who nominated them. The Grist 50 recognizes emerging leaders in climate sustainability and equity — we call them Fixers — who are advancing new ideas and new approaches to a better future.

The following excerpts have been edited for length and clarity.

Josué Rivas: When I saw that you were part of this year’s cohort I felt excited for the future. During the nomination process the first person that came to mind was you. We were making this documentary together Future Ancestor and I was thinking not only is there a need for Indigenous people to be part of this Grist list but Indigenous women particularly. After editing that video of you and really listening and feeling what you were talking about I felt that the future was going to be a beautiful incorporation of the matriarchy back into our society. Right away I knew I wanted to nominate you and welcome you into this community.

Lyla June: We should tell people a bit about the film. I ran for office last year against the oil and gas industry of New Mexico. I raised 125 grand in 20 days. We had donations from all 50 states because the Permian Oil Basin is in New Mexico. It contributes greatly to the climate crisis and has the potential to contribute even more. So I was going full speed ahead and posed a pretty significant threat to the oil establishment. My opponent was getting maxed out donations from ExxonMobil Marathon Oil all these different oil companies.

They just threw everything they had at me. It got pretty crazy. But the cool thing was Josué documented my seven-day fast at the Capitol steps in Santa Fe. That was really fun and beautiful. I was fasting for the next seven generations. And I think what I liked about it most was that we were bringing an Indigenous way of representing and being to the political sphere. And we were also unveiling the Seven Generations New Deal an Indigenous-based climate policy.

Rivas: Knowing you through the years and knowing your spirit and your leadership I knew that you were going into this full force — and also that it was much bigger than you. It was much bigger than just your campaign. You were igniting something that hopefully people are going to pick up on. What you were doing was very courageous and I think that’s why I wanted to document it.

Another thing I learned and I continue to learn is putting forward a new paradigm of how we tell our stories as Indigenous peoples. This is your film as much as it’s all of ours. Tell me a little bit about how you felt telling your story.

June: As Indigenous peoples being filmed or being represented in the world can sometimes be a challenging experience because of the history of misrepresentation. I totally understand that you’re not supposed to control how you’re represented in the media. But it is nice to have a safe place where you can share your Indigenous story on the climate crisis and know you’re going to have agency over how you’re represented. I knew that you were down with that. It’s like how you say “I don’t take photos I make photos” or “I don’t shoot with my camera. I go and I make art” — all the language that you use to decolonize photography and videography.

Rivas: Tell me a little bit about your academic path. I’ve always been so inspired by that because I’m not an academic at all. How does that inspire you in your life right now?

June: I’m in the middle of a doctoral program. I’m sort of getting into the meat of writing technical papers on pre-Colombian Indigenous food systems and how those are so connected to regional ecosystems management. You know we didn’t used to have these little plots of food. It was like the Earth was our garden. The Earth was our farm. And we tended it in the same way a farmer would tend an acre but we tended whole mountain ranges.

One of my papers was about Indigenous burning practices and controlled burns. Fire kept the cycles flowing on this continent for thousands of years. Every region of this continent was burned routinely — you bring all that debris into ash which fertilizes the soil. Now they’re talking about biochar like it’s this new technology. We’ve been doing that for thousands of years.

So that’s my fire paper. My water paper was about Indigenous fisheries. I took six case studies and one was the Chesapeake Bay where Algonquin peoples oversaw an oyster fishery for 10000 years.

Rivas: That’s insane.

June: Yeah! America’s been eating oysters out of the Chesapeake for 300 years and the oyster population has pretty much collapsed. But by looking at the archeological record we can see that these oyster shells not only persisted for 10000 years but got bigger over time — meaning that ancestors sustainably harvested oysters and actually grew them for 10000 years. And each of these six case studies of Indigenous fisheries were all at least 6000 years old where they were harvesting the same species from the same locale for over 6000 years straight. If that’s not sustainability I don’t know what it is.

I’m obviously nerding out on this quite a bit. I did the fire the water now I’m doing the Earth all focused on Indigenous soil management.

Rivas: As you talk about these studies that you’re doing I can’t stop thinking about how that would be a beautiful documentary. How you’re going to these different places — so you’re doing fire water Earth and then air?

June: You know I haven’t thought about air. I was like what is the air? Is it the cultural knowledge? But now I’m realizing the air is climate — and how all of this connects to climate.

Rivas: I’m a visual person. So as you’re talking about all these scientific things that’s translated to me in images. And I think that’s important for people to see themselves in these stories.

In the film you said something that just blew my mind completely which was that we’re planting seeds for people we will never meet. That stuck with me and it has been running my life really in a lot of ways. Tell me a little bit about that.

June: Right now we’re thinking about the next fiscal quarter. Or maybe the next five years. I’m guilty of that too. I was indoctrinated in this culture. You don’t really think “How are we as a national community going to work together to make sure that our great great great great great great grandchildren have a wonderful life?” I’m trying to have that run my life too.

Let’s make sure we pass on to our children what works — which is honoring women honoring water honoring biodiversity and honoring humility as the highest technology that we as human beings can ever possess.

And by the way anything smart I say I’m just plagiarizing my elders. Everything I’m sharing is my elders’ wisdom so I’ve got to give a shout-out to them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZXJneXZvaWNlLmNvbS9vaWxhbmRnYXMvYW1lcmljYXMvZGVjb20tYW1lcmljYXMvMzYxOTM4L2FwYWNoZS1jb3JwLWRlY29tbWlzc2lvbmluZy1ndWxmLW9mLW1leGljby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apache Corp takes £326million decommissioning hit over long-sold Gulf of Mexico assets,"Apache Corporation has taken a hit of £326million ($446m) over decommissioning costs for Gulf of Mexico oil and gas assets it sold nearly a decade ago.

In its third quarter results the US-based oil company recorded the losses on assets it sold for $3.5billion in 2013 to Fieldwood Energy who emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August this year.

A judge ruled earlier this year that Fieldwood could seek bankruptcy protection in the states passing part of costs for the $7.2billion total liability for hundreds of oil wells to previous owners and insurers

Apache (Nasdaq: APA) said: “ Following Fieldwood’s emergence from bankruptcy in August 2021 Apache evaluated remaining net abandonment obligations related to its legacy Gulf of Mexico properties.”

It concluded that “future net cash flows from the properties and available financial security will not be sufficient to fund all of the remaining retirement obligations”.

Apache recorded the £326million in Q3 representing excess of liability over the assets and a non-current contingent decommissioning liability of $1.2billion.

The firm therefore recorded net losses of £83m attributable to shareholders in the quarter which otherwise would have been profits of £272m.

Shell BP ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil have also held stakes in the various Fieldwood assets and have been embroiled in the dispute.

The issue of decommissioning liabilities have also played out recently in the UK where Apache had more fortune and succeeded in a legal challenge against ExxonMobil over a £100m bill.

Apache revenues totalled £1.17bn up from £835m in Q3 2020 while production totalled 388941 barrels of oil equivalent per day down 13% on 445241 boe per day in the same period last year.

In the North Sea production dropped 32% year on year to 40608 boepd from 59588 barrels as extended maintenance turnaround activity & unplanned downtime took a toll.

A production increase is expected in Q4 Apache said but October remained “constrained”.

Chief executive John Christmann said: “APA delivered another excellent quarter driven by strong US well performance continued capital and cost discipline and better-than-expected commodity prices”

The firm repurchased 14.7m shares in October and announced an increase in its annual dividend to 50 cents per share.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWlsaXRhbnQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMTAvY29hbC1taW5lcnMtaW4tYWxhYmFtYS1zdGFuZC11cC10by13YXJyaW9yLW1ldC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coal miners in Alabama stand up to Warrior Met – The Militant,"Members of the United Mine Workers voted April 9 to reject the tentative agreement reached with the owners of Warrior Met Coal April 5. The strike continues.

BROOKWOOD Ala. – More than 1100 United Mine Workers of America members struck Warrior Met Coal April 1 after contract negotiations with the bosses failed to reach an agreement acceptable to the union.

“I was at the picket line all night last night after the strike started” Antwon McGee told Militant worker-correspondents at the UMWA Local 2397 union hall which represents miners at the No. 7 mine. “I’ve been over there all day and now I’m taking a short break and getting ready to head back over to the line again.”

The strike includes the company’s No. 4 and No. 7 mines their coal preparation plant and a central shop all located in Tuscaloosa County.

Spirited picket lines are up at all the strike sites where union members are getting organized with supplies burn barrels and portable bathrooms. Young miners and veterans together hold the “United We Stand with UMWA Miners” picket signs and wave back at the many trucks and cars whose drivers honk their horns and wave in support. This is the first UMWA strike here in Brookwood in decades. Many strikers are second- or even third-generation miners.

“The company can’t keep mistreating us and not expect to get a reaction” 61-year-old Rocky Davis said on the picket line outside the prep plant. “We feel like the company is trying to get rid of the union.” He said he had started in the mines when he was 17 years old.

The Warrior Met mines mainly produce metallurgical coal used in steel production by manufacturers in Europe South America and Asia. The company was set up in January 2016 following the bankruptcy of Jim Walter Resources and its parent company Walter Energy the year before.

The Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Alabama approved the sale to a couple of hedge funds that were senior creditors of Walter Energy.

The “new” mine owners used the capitalist bankruptcy court and subsequent company reorganization to press for concessions on wages and working conditions that UMWA members had fought for and won over decades.

Under the five-year contract the union agreed to in 2016 several miners told us the company forced wage cuts loss of sick days and holidays higher costs for health care no overtime pay until after 40 hours work widening wage gaps between job classifications loss of paid lunches forced Sunday work increased use of outside contractors and attempts to shortcut safety to speed up production along with other measures.

Before the strike company officials had announced plans to spend millions to expand their mining operations but claimed they couldn’t meet the union’s demands due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile upper management recently paid themselves $35000 bonuses.

“The company is using more and more contractors to do jobs that used to be worked by union members” said veteran miner Efren Barrientos originally from Mexico at the prep plant picket line. Formerly there was a contractual limit on how many outside contractors the company could use a limit the company now regularly exceeds he and other miners said.

“‘We are one’ — that’s us!” Tyler Bittle 22 who has worked at the No. 7 mine for two years told us while picketing at the mine entrance. Like many other younger miners he first came in as a contract worker and then was hired by the company and joined the union. “We are standing together all the men — and the women too!”

Miners in Brookwood are very aware of the union-organizing drive going on at the Amazon fulfillment center in nearby Bessemer. UMWA Local 2397 President Carl White attended a solidarity rally for the drive held in February. “I hope they win the union they really need it” many striking miners told us.

The strikers have begun receiving support from area workers and unions. Volunteers and staffers from the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union — the union Amazon workers are trying to win recognition for — visited the miners’ picket lines April 3.

A United Steelworkers union official from the U.S. Steel pipe mill near Birmingham brought burn barrels for the picket lines April 2 promising further solidarity from the USW.

Warrior Met bosses said they have contingency plans to “continue meeting the demands of our key customers.” Miners are alert to any steps by the company that point toward an attempt to restart production such as bringing in more contract workers.

“This strike is helping educate the young miners on what the union is all about” said veteran miner Steve Mote at the No. 7 picket line. “The company has money and they’re spending it” he said. “They just don’t want to spend it on us.”

At the Hilton it’s all about “Travel with Purpose”. At the InterContinental it’s a “Journey to Tomorrow”. At the Marriott they “Serve 360”. These days all the world’s largest hotel chains have a corporate responsibility slogan — and a programme — complete with environmental targets.

As an industry hotels account for about 1 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions according to a 2018 UN World Tourism Organisation report. So with pressure mounting to address climate change the businesses have needed ways to bring these down.

In the past year closures forced by the coronavirus pandemic have made it easier for them to achieve this. But as global economies start to reopen the chains now face a double difficulty: meeting ambitious green targets while securing a post-pandemic recovery.

“There’s this challenge for us at the moment . . . short term versus long term” says Catherine Dolton vice-president of global corporate responsibility at InterContinental Hotels Group.

In 2017 the International Tourism Partnership (now the Sustainable Hospitality Alliance) laid out targets for hotels aligned to the Paris inter-governmental climate agreement: a 66 per cent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions per room by 2030 and 90 per cent by 2050 compared with a 2010 baseline.

Between 2018 and 2019 Willy Legrand a professor of hospitality management at IUBH business school analysed the nine largest international hotel chains (by number of properties) and found that only one — Accor — had adopted targets in line with the SHA’s recommendations.

In addition hotel groups’ sustainability strategies remain hard to compare because they often use different base years target years and units of measurement.

15% Marriott’s target for reducing its carbon footprint from 2016 to 2025

For example Wyndham Hotels’ latest target commits the group to reducing emissions by 15 per cent by 2025 from a baseline of 2019. “It’s difficult to judge whether this is on track to a 90 per cent reduction by 2050” says Prof Legrand. Wyndham declined to comment.

Hilton group has pledged to reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions from sites it owns or manages (not including its franchised hotels) by 61 per cent per square metre by 2030 from a 2008 base year. But Marriott has committed to reducing its carbon footprint across its portfolio by 30 per cent by 2025 from a 2016 baseline.

Meanwhile IHG’s 2030 target is a 15 per cent reduction of emissions in its managed hotels and a 46 per cent reduction per square metre in franchised hotels from a 2018 base year.

While data gathering on carbon emissions is now standard practice assessing other elements of hotels’ sustainability goals — such as water usage — can be more complex. Measuring the impact of water usage for example depends on local conditions.

Sustainability criteria such as switching to refillable toiletry bottles are embedded in franchise standards. Numerical targets for carbon emissions are not

The Sustainable Hospitality Alliance’s goal on water pledges “increased water-use efficiency” but does not include a numerical target. It says this is because “water issues such as scarcity pollution and community access to clean water are intrinsically linked to their local context”.

A hotel using large volumes of water in a water-rich area has less impact than a hotel using average volumes in a dry area.

“It is very tough to make measurable progress there” says Kate Mikesell vice-president of corporate responsibility at Hilton. “There are just so many different systems that we would have to take into account.” She refers to measures such as where water comes from conflicts with community usage and infrastructure for treatment.

Hilton has a target to reduce water in its managed operations by 50 per cent from a 2008 baseline but like IHG and others it does not have a group-wide target that encompasses franchises. Dolton says: “Our data isn’t that great today so we don’t want to set a hard target when we know we don’t have a good baseline.”

Another difficulty lies in the chains’ franchise models. “We can’t really tell the franchises how to operate their hotels” says Denise Naguib vice-president of sustainability at Marriott. While some sustainability criteria such as the elimination of styrofoam and switching from mini toiletries to large refillable bottles are embedded in franchise standards numerical targets for carbon emissions are not.

Refillable bottles for toiletries are one way to make a difference

Instead Marriott requires hotel owners to use its environmental reporting platform called Mesh. They must supply quantitative and qualitative sustainability data which provides Marriott with group-wide baseline information. Marriott says it then uses that data to give guidance — not requirements — to its franchisees. “There is no penalty if they don’t meet them but we’re recommending goals” Naguib says.

A business case for sustainability improvements for everything from low-consumption shower heads and LED lights to water-recycling systems can be a stronger incentive Dolton argues. “Clearly the way to do this is to speak from a business perspective how these things will save costs” she says.

Because of the pandemic Dolton admits it has “definitely become much harder” to suggest environmental improvements that will save money in the long run but require large upfront investment. “In the next couple of years it's going to be difficult to achieve significant carbon reductions purely because our owners aren't going to be investing a lot in solutions” she says. “But it's all about taking that journey towards [IHG’s 2030] targets.”

Still she notes franchise holders “are extremely receptive to things that might save them costs” such as energy efficient lightbulbs.

What if hotels miss their targets? According to Prof Legrand: “There isn’t a consequence except a PR consequence . . . unless we have a proper carbon market and we say: ‘OK this is a target and whatever you emit above it is going to cost you.’”

Dolton says there is increased investor interest in financial accountability — for example by tying the remuneration of senior executives to sustainability targets via long-term incentive plans. However she says these are just discussions so far.

‘Short term versus long term challenge’: Catherine Dolton IHG

Green financing could also have a part to play says Inge Huijbrechts senior vice-president of sustainability at Radisson Hotel Group.

In 2019 Edwardian Hotels one of Radisson’s franchise partners borrowed £175m from HSBC to finance redevelopment of The Londoner hotel in Leicester Square. A condition of the loan was that the building had to achieve an “excellent” rating under the BREEAM energy standard a benchmarking system used across the UK. This requires the use of low-carbon construction materials and high levels of energy efficiency in operation. The loan was the first of its kind in the hotel sector.

“It seems like [green financing] hasn't really reached its full potential in the hotel industry and that’s certainly something that's worth exploring more” says Huijbrechts.

“What matters most now is the path toward full decarbonisation” reckons Prof Legrand. This is a journey that he says must be followed closely. “There is an argument to be made for hotels’ targets [for decarbonisation by 2050] to be third-party verified so that transparency is available across the board.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXBpbnRvLm5ldC90b3ducy9oYXNicm91Y2staGVpZ2h0cy1zbGFzaC13b29kLXJpZGdlLXNsYXNoLXRldGVyYm9yby9zZWN0aW9ucy9idXNpbmVzcy1hbmQtZmluYW5jZS9hcnRpY2xlcy93b29kLXJpZGdlLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtaG90ZWwtZ3JhbmQtb3BlbmluZy13aXRoLXJpYmJvbi1jdXR0aW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wood-Ridge Celebrates Hotel Grand Opening with Ribbon Cutting,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.tapinto.net/towns/hasbrouck-heights-slash-wood-ridge-slash-teterboro/sections/business-and-finance/articles/wood-ridge-celebrates-hotel-grand-opening-with-ribbon-cutting on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXBpbnRvLm5ldC90b3ducy9oYXNicm91Y2staGVpZ2h0cy1zbGFzaC13b29kLXJpZGdlLXNsYXNoLXRldGVyYm9yby9zZWN0aW9ucy9idXNpbmVzcy1hbmQtZmluYW5jZS9hcnRpY2xlcy93b29kLXJpZGdlLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtaG90ZWwtZ3JhbmQtb3BlbmluZy13aXRoLXJpYmJvbi1jdXR0aW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvc2VydmljZXMvaG90ZWxzLS8tcmVzdGF1cmFudHMvbWFycmlvdHQtY29udGludWVzLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLXdpdGgtbXVtYmFpLWluZGlhbnMtZm9yLXRoZS1zZWNvbmQteWVhci1ydW5uaW5nL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgyMDAyMTg0LmNtc9IBrgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvc2VydmljZXMvaG90ZWxzLS8tcmVzdGF1cmFudHMvbWFycmlvdHQtY29udGludWVzLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLXdpdGgtbXVtYmFpLWluZGlhbnMtZm9yLXRoZS1zZWNvbmQteWVhci1ydW5uaW5nL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MjAwMjE4NC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marriott continues partnership with Mumbai Indians for the second year running,"It seems like you're already an ETPrime member with

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term performance of a company's stock. The faster a company is growing the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Marsh & McLennan is 7.6% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in Insurance industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 6.9% which ranks in the middle range of the companies in Insurance industry.

Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months Marsh & McLennan's return on invested capital is 8.10 and its cost of capital is 6.31. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Marsh & McLennan is shown below:

The company is preparing to sell or list a minority stake in order to draw more global investors who are seeking to capitalize on quickly-growing FinTech assets.

MTN currently has 280 million global subscribers and added almost 12 million new users to its mobile money arm for a total of over 46 million in 2020.

Ralph Mupita company chief executive said that the unit should be worth at least $5 billion to $6 billion. He said the group would be spinning it out within the next year.

MTN is listed in Johannesburg and had rolled out the separation plan last month as part of a shift in strategy. The shift will cut $3 billion in net debt FT reports.

The group is aiming to tap into the burgeoning investor interest for the mobile money business built up by African telecoms over the past decade which allow phone subscribers to send or receive money outside of banks and more often sell ancillary services including microinsurance.

MTN’s mobile money business has over double the 21 million users of rival Airtel Africa FT writes and the group’s financial services interests also have an insurance joint venture with more than 10 million customers.

With the move MTN is also anticipating some regulatory scrutiny in Africa with more complex financial services wholly owned by mobile phone companies.

MTN rival Airtel Africa has recently closed a deal for $100 million which gave Mastercard a 3.75 stake in its business and valued it overall now at $2.65 billion.

Raghunath Mandava chief executive officer (CEO) of Airtel Africa said the investment from Mastercard would help the company’s mission of reaching underserved regions with new financial tools.

That investment also boosted the company’s existing relationship with Mastercard including “extended commercial agreements” and an updated “commercial framework” for numerous geographies and payment methods.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzkwMWU5YWZlLTRkZTEtNDdjMy05NmE4LTU0MzEzZDVkNDQ0ZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MTN targets valuation of at least $5bn for mobile money arm,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

It is planning to offer its services in the local market from next month aiming to attract 50000 users in this country over the first three years of its operation.

“Woli is quite different to other services in that it is a solution designed exclusively to meet the needs of children and teenagers” says Vassilis Zoupas the company’s chief executive and one of the four co-founders of Woli.

The company has created a banking app designed for families with children aged between 10 and 18 through which parents can create a bank account for their children. Next a prepaid Mastercard will be issued in the children’s name and sent to them so that they can manage their money and control their savings.

Woli just like other fintech companies is licensed by the central bank of Lithuania as an electronic money distributor so that it can promote its services across all countries in the European Economic Area.

“Through this app parents will practically be able to render pocket money more automatic receive real-time notifications about transactions in their accounts and teach their kids how to manage their incomes. Furthermore children will get access to their first online account with a card and will be able to manage their money set savings targets and build up their economic knowledge through interactive lessons and quizzes” explains Zoupas.

He adds that the app contributes significantly toward children’s financial literacy which will be helpful for them as they grow up and enter a digital and cashless environment.

“Last year Revolut launched a program for children that is addressed to its adult subscribers which renders it an indirect rival of Woli. However that is restricted to basic banking services and does not offer educational services” notes Zoupas stressing what differentiates Woli from other apps.

Therefore through the Woli app children will be able to learn about saving money and earn their pocket money via “homework” their parents will give them to do. Crucially the Woli card cannot perform transactions for adults (e.g. gambling).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnMxOW5ld3MuY29tL3N0b3J5LzQzNjQyMjYxL211YW1hLXJ5b2tvLXJldmlld3MtNDUtbmV3LTRnLXdpZmktcm91dGVyLW9uLXRoZS1tYXJrZXQtbmRhc2gtcHJvZHVjdC1yZXZpZXctYnktcHJvZHVjdHdvcmxk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Muama Ryoko Reviews - New 4G Wifi Router on the Market – Product Review by ProductWorld,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNpdGl6ZW4uY28udHovdGFuemFuaWEvbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC9haXJ0ZWwtYWZyaWNhLWFubm91bmNlcy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC13aXRoLW1hc3RlcmNhcmQtMjY5NDAzMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airtel Africa announces partnership with MasterCard | The Citizen,"Nairobi.

Dating app Hinge has today announced it will be giving out £100 to couples who match on the site go on an in-person date this week and want a second date

To ensure both people on the date have equal control Hinge will give £50 to each of the aspiring lovers.

Hinge is one of the most popular dating apps in Britain combining the swiping of rival apps like Tinder with a more personal approach asking in-depth questions.

Tinder will roll out a background check feature in 2021 Tinder along with all dating apps owned by Match Group will soon let users vet potential dates prior to meeting them in person - but for a fee. Match group announced a partnership with the non-profit background check platform Garbo Monday which will be integrated into Tinder and other dating apps like OKCupid and Match. The cost of the service has yet to be revealed but the average fee for a national criminal background check is about $7 to $15 per request. Advertisement

The £50 per person will only be given to users if they organise a first in-person date this week between April 12 and 18. Hinge anticipates 50000 dates will take place in the UK this week.

Users are encouraged to observe coronavirus rules and take suitable safety precautions such as avoiding getting too cosy and following social distancing.

After their first date singles who want to go on a follow-up soirée must log back onto the app after 2pm BST on April 19 and report their first date via the 'We Met' feature.

Once a Hinge user has done this Hinge will email instructions for receiving the £50 gift card that can be used for a second date.

The vouchers will be sent out on a first-come first-served basis.

Hinge says 75 per cent of its users do decide to go on a second date with someone they have matched with on the app.

Each person must go through this process to get the £50 voucher so both partners must do it in order to get the maximum £100.

Hinge says that according to its own research more than half (54 per cent) of users pay up to £50 on a first date.

Hinge has also today rolled out its 'Video Prompts' feature which it says is a unique virtual dating tool which will allow daters to kick start conversations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRleGVydG8uY29tL2NhbGwtb2YtZHV0eS9vcHRpYy1zY3VtcC1zbGFtcy1taW5uZXNvdGEtcm9ra3ItZm9yLWNsYXNzbGVzcy1wb3N0LW1hdGNoLXR3ZWV0cy0xNTUxMTI5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OpTic Scump slams Minnesota ROKKR for “classless” post-match tweets,"OpTic Chicago’s Seth ‘Scump’ Abner has hit out at fellow CDL team Minnesota ROKKR for their post-match tweets after the two orgs played out a nail-bitingly close encounter in the Stage II Major.

Despite the organization’s illustrious history OpTic Chicago have struggled to mirror any of the OpTic brand’s past successes this season. A decent group stage saw them start the Stage II Major in the Winners’ Bracket but a 3-1 loss to the Toronto Ultra dropped them into the Losers’ Bracket.

From there they eliminated Seattle Surge setting up a tie with the Minnesota ROKKR. It turned out to be one of the most memorable matches of the season going all the way down to a Moscow Map 5 Round 11. OpTic were leading the final SnD 5-2 but once again couldn’t close it out.

Round 11 swung in OpTic’s favor with the Greenwall setting up a 4v2 over the A bomb site. Then inexplicably Envoy charged at Accuracy giving the Minnesota man a free chance to make it a 2v3. Scump made it a 3v1 by eliminating Attach before Accuracy finished every remaining member of Chicago in an ice-cold three-piece.

The moment was remarkable and prompted a now-deleted tweet from the ROKKR which read: “We are witnessing a breakdown.” Attached to the tweet was an image of the OpTic’s players’ reactions most with heads in hands. Scump was one of many to criticize the tweet calling it “disrespectful” and “classless”.

“This is some of the most disrespectful sh*t I seen” he said. “We are literally heartbroken and you use it for impressions? Post the clutch post your celebration but kicking us like this? Your team was literally banking on us to get first seed last week. So unbelievably classless.”

Another tweet from the King said: “There is a HUGE difference between talking trash on LAN and an org tweeting a picture of the other teams heartbroken cams after a heartbreaking loss.”

There was a divided response. Ex-Call of Duty caster Chris Puckett was one to weigh in echoing the opinion that the tweet was fine and CoD has gone “soft”.

Scump responded once again highlighting the ROKKR’s focus on OpTic’s reaction rather than their success. He went on to say that trash talk between players is fine but the “kick in the chest” from an organization was unnecessary.

ROKKR have since deleted the tweet apologizing to the OpTic Chicago players and saying it was “out of line”.

Whatever followed the game the Minnesota ROKKR will progress to Championship Sunday meeting Toronto Ultra in Losers’ Round 5. The winner of that will then face Dallas Empire in the Losers’ Final with Atlanta FaZe waiting in the Grand Final.

For the first time in 13 months WWE welcomed fans back to its live events with 25675 assembling in the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Florida for the opening night of WrestleMania 37.

Vince McMahon kicked off part one of the WWE's biggest event in its calendar by standing on the elaborate entrance alongside the entire company roster to welcome back the fans.

The opening night featured seven matches in total with three being title bouts - Drew McIntyre challenged Bobby Lashley for the WWE Championship AJ Styles and his monstrous bodyguard – Omos – tussled with The New Day for the Raw Tag Team Titles and Sasha Banks defended her Smackdown Women's Championship against Bianca Belair in the main event.

The event was hosted by WWE legend Hulk Hogan and company global ambassador Titus O'Neill. Before the matches could kick off however for the first time in Mania history there was a delay to proceedings with a torrential downpour halting proceedings by half an hour.

Our resident star ratings aficionado Mo Chatra gives his verdict here - each match is rated out of six with any match rated five stars or more generally considered to be an all-time classic.

WWE Championship Match

Bobby Lashley (c) vs. Drew McIntyre

Night one of WrestleMania kicked off with one of the weekend's biggest contests as Bobby Lashley locked horns with former champ Drew McIntyre for the WWE title.

Both big men seem really energised by competing in front of a large crowd and pulled out all the stops in a great match. In the end Lashley retained his belt when the referee called for the bell after Drew was unable to escape from the Hurt Lock.

WWE Women's Tag Team Title Number One Contenders Tag Team Turmoil Match

Lana & Naomi vs. Billie Kay & Carmella vs. The Riott Squad vs. Dana Brooke & Mandy Rose vs. Natalya & Tamina

The winner of this bout would earn a crack at Nia Jax and Shayna Baszler’s WWE Women’s tag team titles on the night two card. This was comfortably the worst match on the show.

The match featured more than its fair share of sloppiness despite all of the competitors in the match working hard. Natalya and Tamina won the match after 14 minutes to set up a highly unanticipated title bout with Nia and Shayna later tonight.

Rating: *1/2

Singles match

Seth Rollins vs. Cesaro

Business picked up once more when two of the WWE's finest clashed. The fans were up for this one - and Rollins and Cesaro fed off of the crowd’s energy. They contested a highly energetic up-tempo bout that featured two big swings by Cesaro.

In somewhat of an upset he triumphed over Seth upending the former WWE champ with a Neutralizer after eleven minutes. A highly enjoyable outing.

Rating: ***3/4

Raw Tag Team Championship Match

The New Day (c) vs. AJ Styles & Omos

In Omos' main roster debut the 7ft 3in giant linked arms with AJ Styles to take on Xavier Woods and Kofi Kingston for the WWE Raw tag team straps. Styles fought most of the match against Woods and Kofi before making a hot tag to Omos (who was competing in only his seventh career match).

The behemoth ran roughshod over the champs before defeating Kingston with a choke bomb to capture the belts for he and Styles. At less than 10 minutes it was short but served to make Omos look like a future headline act. This was fun.

Steel Cage Match

Shane McMahon vs. Braun Strowman

Before the match began Elias and Jaxson Ryker came to Shane’s aid and attacked beastly Braun with chairs. Shane continued with the chair-assisted attack when the match commenced in the cage. Towards the end Strowman thwarted McMahon’s attempt to escape the cage for victory by ripping the mesh and dragging Shane back in.

He then tossed McMahon from the top of the cage right into the middle of the ring. A powerslam later and Strowman had his arm lifted in victory. Given Shane was involved this was never going to contend for match of the night honours but it was still perfectly fine and featured several memorable moments.

Tag team match

The Miz & John Morrison vs. Bad Bunny & Damian Priest

In the night’s penultimate bout celebrity presence in the form of music artist Bad Bunny graced the WWE ring. Unlike many past celebrity appearances in the squared circle Bunny performed impressively well and pulled out a top rope dive to the floor as well as a Canadian Destroyer. He and Priest won this very entertaining effort when Bunny pinned Miz with the Doomsday Device after fifteen minutes.

Rating: ***1/2

Smackdown Women’s Championship Match

Sasha Banks (c) vs. Bianca Belair

In a fitting end to night one of WrestleMania Bianca Belair’s big moment had arrived with a crack at Sasha Banks' Smackdown Women’s title. The emotion of the moment seemed to get to both before the bell had even rung with Belair in particular struggling to hold back the tears during the introductions.

The match itself was great - both women crafted a creative entertaining and emotive bout that had fans in attendance lapping up every moment. It was Belair after 17 climatic minutes who ascended to the WWE's pinnacle when she pinned Banks following a KOD to capture her first championship.

If Mania needs to be split over two nights to accommodate all matches but it results in two shows of acceptable duration then we're all in favour of it.

As for night one it was a superb start to Mania weekend.

Three thrilling matches supplemented by another three good contests (with only one poor bout) set the bar high for night two.

The night was capped off by a thrilling emotional main event.

The WWE is often criticised for allowing WrestleMania to be a parade of stars from yesteryear but Shane McMahon aside this event was framed very much around its present and future.

The most famous snow stoppage in English cricket in Buxton in June 1975  has become so romanticised in retelling that it would be no surprise to read one day that sleigh bells were magically heard in the pavilion and everybody feasted on chestnuts and mulled wine.

Whatever you may be told 50 years from now about the sudden snow storm that engulfed Headingley the truth is that it was a suitably miserable conclusion to one of the coldest most disconsolate mornings in Yorkshire cricket's history.

Both Yorkshire new-ball bowlers off the field injured during the second day of the Championship season; a wicketless morning as Glamorgan carefully plotted an unexpected victory against a debilitated attack; and gaping empty stands because of the Covid-19 restrictions that implied the futility of it all. Wherever in the world that cricket was being enjoyed in whatever format at whatever level it had to be better than this.

The Buxton blizzard was special because it was snow in June abnormal even in the Peak District. It hit the news bulletins and somehow captured the gentle romanticism of county cricket played on outgrounds: spectators and officials were photographed going about their business in overcoats. Snow at Headingley on April 10 2021 came in a different world. It merely contended that Championship cricket so early in the year with 14 English professionals away at the IPL and other international players rested is at best an exercise in optimism and at worst a commitment that is unsustainable.

Bizarrely Headingley existed in its own particularly hostile micro-climate - an international ground closed not just to the public but it appeared to pleasure itself. After two intriguing hard-fought days in defiance of the conditions it was a desperate shame.

Beyond the confines of the ground what snow there was disappeared in an instant. A few miles away the skies remained clear. There were cyclists in abundance. Walkers and golfers were braving the cold. Cricketers were about to take to the field for the start of the season in the local leagues. Old timers passed on tips about wearing the first of two sweaters back to front to keep out the cold; golf handwarmers lurked in pockets; and there would be a few late cry-offs for unconvincing reasons.

The Headingley forecast had been for a ""light shower day"" with rain creeping in by late afternoon. The reality was a one-hour burst of snow and hail as the players left the field for lunch with temperatures plummeting to 4C one of the coldest days ever recorded in Championship history.

Within minutes the outfield was bathed in white the only sport conducted by a couple of excitable crows indulging in a spot of body surfing. Umpires Paul Baldwin and Russell Warren inspected soon after the snow had departed at 2.30pm and abandoned play an hour later at 3.30pm. Unlike Buxton nobody much fancied an idealised photograph.

Glamorgan rued their luck. They had batted through the morning session in the shape of Billy Root and Chris Cooke  adding 98 to stretch their lead to 298. Root seems to be making a belated bid to be regarded as the most sensible brother. They have only won at Headingley once before in 1999 although they have triumphed surprisingly often in powerful Yorkshire eras at the long-abandoned venues at Bramall Lane and Middlesbrough.

'We've been average' - Gale ""It's frustrating and a massive blow [losing Coad and Fisher]"" Yorkshire coach Andrew Gale said. ""We're behind in the game anyway but when you lose two seamers it's always going to be tough. Had we had Ben Coad running down the hill early this morning a couple of quick wickets and you never know. But we're certainly up against it now.

""We've been pretty average in this game if we're honest. We've got a lot of work to do but we've been thrown a bit of a lifeline with the weather. We have three sessions left in the game. There's a lot of work to do so we have to bring our A game. When we bat we have to do it well. If we can walk off with a draw tomorrow we can say 'We've haven't been at our best but at least we've got something out of the game'.""

Yorkshire would have been privately relieved when the snow came. They awoke to confirmation that Matt Fisher with an abdominal injury and Ben Coad with a chest muscle injury would not be fit to bowl for the rest of the match the extent of their injuries not yet confirmed. The frontline seam attack was left to Steve Patterson a 37-year-old captain and the South African Duanne Olivier whose own match preparations amounted to 20 days' compulsory quarantine evenly divided between the Maldives and West Yorkshire.

Patterson often comes into his own on hangdog days like these but his persistence posed no threat. Olivier so unpredictable that some Yorkshire cricket followers imagine that he is the living embodiment of the ""South African variant"" also did little of note. The oohs and aahs rested with the offspinner Dom Bess who had a rejected appeal for a catch at slip when Billy Root was 43 and who passed Chris Cooke's outside edge on several occasions. Long before the first flurry of snow however both batsmen had secured half-centuries.

With Yorkshire in such a plight starting the day with Joe Root's offspin - he had almost bowled his brother Billy in the final over on the previous evening - might have been an imaginative gambit. But Patterson is not that sort of captain and Andrew Gale is not that sort of coach."

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey leads GOP rival in Pennsylvania Senate race: Poll,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4630466-pennsylvania-senate-bob-casey-david-mccormick/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTkvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvZGF2ZS1tY2Nvcm1pY2stZmFybS1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This G.O.P. Senate Candidate Says He Grew Up on a Family Farm. Not Exactly.,"David McCormick’s origin story goes something like this: He grew up in rural Pennsylvania southwest of Scranton.

“I spent most of my life in Pennsylvania growing up in Bloomsburg on my family’s farm” Mr. McCormick now a Republican candidate for Senate told Pittsburgh Quarterly in 2022.

“I’ve truly lived the American dream” he wrote in a fund-raising appeal in October. “My life’s journey — from growing up on a farm in Bloomsburg to graduating from West Point and serving in the 82nd Airborne Division growing a business in Pittsburgh and serving at the highest levels of government — reflects that.”

“I grew up on a family farm from the time I was a kid” he said at the Pennsylvania farm show in January.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RydW1wLWJpZGVuLW1jY29ybWljay1jYXNleS1zZW5hdGUtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXByaW1hcnktMTI0ODRlNjVhNjhmNDM2NGZlYzUxZWM1ZDQ2MGU1MzjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey and McCormick to face each other as nominees in Pennsylvania's high-stakes US Senate contest,"HARRISBURG Pa. (AP) — Democratic Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger David McCormick will face each other in Pennsylvania’s high-stakes U.S. Senate contest this fall as Tuesday’s primary election put the men on track for a race that is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars and help decide control of the Senate next year.

Casey and McCormick won their respective party primary contests after they were uncontested and now enter what is likely to be a grueling expensive and hard-fought 2024 general election campaign that culminates in the Nov. 5 vote.

Casey seeking his fourth term is perhaps Pennsylvania’s best-known politician and a stalwart of the presidential swing state’s Democratic Party — the son of a former two-term governor and Pennsylvania’s longest-ever serving Democrat in the Senate.

McCormick is a two-time Senate challenger a former hedge fund CEO and a Pennsylvania native who spent $14 million of his own money only to lose narrowly to celebrity heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz in 2022’s seven-way GOP primary. Oz then lost to Democratic Sen. John Fetterman in a pivotal Senate contest.

This time around McCormick has consolidated the party around his candidacy and is backed by a super PAC that’s already reported raising more than $20 million much of it from securities-trading billionaires.

What to know about the 2024 Election

McCormick’s candidacy is shaping up as the strongest challenge to Casey in his three reelection bids. McCormick has worked to shore up support in the GOP base and on Tuesday night hammered his message at his election night gathering in Pittsburgh that Casey is a do-nothing senator.

“We’re now turning to the general election and here’s the truth: Pennsylvania deserves better than Bob Casey You deserve better” McCormick said. “Bob Casey’s defining achievement in his political life 30 years in political office has been to be the son of Bob Casey Sr. That is what defines his political career.”

Casey in Washington on Tuesday to cast votes in favor of $95 billion in war aid to Ukraine Israel and Taiwan said on social media that “there are 196 days until the general election and we’re going to win.” Meanwhile the state Democratic Party unveiled a minute-long digital ad slamming McCormick as a “millionaire hedge fund executive who is lying to Pennsylvanians.”

The Senate candidates will share a ticket with candidates for president in a state that is critical to whether Democrats can maintain control of the White House and the Senate.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump won their party nominations easily after all major rivals dropped out. Both men made campaign trips to swing-state Pennsylvania in recent days and voters can expect to see plenty of them their TV ads and their surrogates campaigning over the next six months in a state that swung from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020.

Of note however could be the number of “ uncommitted ” write-in votes cast in the Democratic primary to protest Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

In the Senate contest Democrats have attacked McCormick’s opposition to abortion rights his frequent trips to Connecticut’s ritzy “Gold Coast ” where he keeps a family home and the focus on investing in China during his dozen years as an executive at the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates including as CEO.

Casey has been a key player for Democrats trying to reframe the election-year narrative about the economy by attacking “greedflation” — a blunt term for corporations that jack up prices and rip off shoppers to maximize profits — as fast-rising prices over the past three years have opened a big soft spot in 2024 for Democrats. Indications that the U.S. economy avoided a recession amid efforts to manage inflation have yet to translate into voter enthusiasm for Biden.

McCormick meanwhile has accused Casey of rubber-stamping harmful immigration economic energy and national security policies of Biden and made a bid for Jewish voters by traveling to the Israel-Gaza border and arguing that Biden hasn’t backed Israel strongly enough in the Israel-Hamas war.

Casey is one of Biden’s strongest allies in Congress. McCormick and Trump have endorsed each other but are an awkward duo atop the GOP’s ticket after Trump savaged McCormick in 2022’s primary in a successful bid to lift Oz to his primary win.

Democrats currently hold a Senate majority by the narrowest of margins but face a difficult 2024 Senate map that requires them to defend incumbents in the red states of Montana and Ohio and fight for open seats with new candidates in Michigan and West Virginia.

A Casey loss could guarantee Republican control of the Senate.

Elsewhere on the ballot Tuesday Pennsylvanians decided nominees for an open attorney general’s office and two other statewide offices — treasurer and auditor general — plus all 17 of the state’s U.S. House seats.

For attorney general Republicans nominated Dave Sunday York County’s district attorney in a two-way race while Democrats nominated former state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale of Pittsburgh in a five-person primary field.

Democrats also nominated Erin McClelland a two-time congressional candidate in suburban Pittsburgh who has helped run various human services organizations to challenge Republican state Treasurer Stacy Garrity and they nominated state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta of Philadelphia to challenge Republican state Auditor General Tim DeFoor. McClelland prevailed despite being heavily outspent by her party-endorsed rival.

For Congress 44 candidates were on ballots including all 17 incumbents. All three incumbents facing primary challengers — Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in suburban Philadelphia and Democratic Reps. Dwight Evans in Philadelphia and Summer Lee in a Pittsburgh-based district — won their races.

Lee’s primary against challenger Bhavini Patel has shaped up as an early test of whether Israel’s war with Gaza poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized how it has been handled.

Republicans nominated state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie in a three-way race to challenge Democratic Rep. Susan Wild whose Allentown-based district is closely politically divided while Democrats nominated former TV news personality Janelle Stelson from among six candidates to challenge Republican Rep. Scott Perry in a Republican-leaning district in southern Pennsylvania.

Perry has become a national figure for heading up the ultra-right House Freedom Caucus during a speakership battle and his efforts to help Trump stay in power after losing the 2020 presidential election.

This summer hundreds of McDonald’s eateries located inside Walmart stores across the US are slated to close because of sluggish business — a trend that was accelerated by the pandemic.

The decades-old partnership between the largest restaurant chain and largest retailer in the world has been fraying for years. There were about 1000 McDonald’s restaurants inside Walmart stores during their heyday but by 2020 there were half as many McDonald’s stores Walmart confirmed.

MCDONALD'S TO HIRE 25000 STAFF IN TEXAS THIS MONTH

In July McDonald’s said in its second quarter earnings report that it would be closing 200 restaurants in 2020 and that over half of them were at ""lower sales volume"" Walmart locations.

At the end of the summer just 150 McDonald’s stores will remain at Walmart the retailer confirmed.

The accelerated pace of store closures was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

McDonald’s does a significant amount of business via its drive-thrus — more so since the pandemic began — and Walmart lacks that option sources pointed out. Margins at McDonald’s Walmart locations have likewise been hit as ""customers at times loaded up on refills and condiments"" according to the Journal. Walmart also has largely stopped building new stores instead remodeling them which has created awkward situations according to the paper.

""You can’t do a multimillion-dollar remodel in a store and then have a 1980s McDonald’s at the front"" one source told the Journal.

Subway eateries are also pulling up stakes in Walmart stores according to the paper. The franchise is facing its own challenges as The Post has reported with stores closing across the country.

Walmart which has long relied on rent from restaurants and other in-store tenants to pad its bottom line said its stores will be switching to more grab-and go options. In addition to food Walmart leases space to banks hair and nail salons and veterinarian clinicc. In Texas it has a number of tool-rental stores inside its stores the company said.

""We have a great opportunity with our leased space business to help our stores become even more convenient and relevant to local communities"" the company said in a statement. ""We are excited to continue to bring in new businesses that make sense for our customers and their changing needs.""

Walmart is testing smoothie vending machines in stores and opening Charleys Philly Steaks locations which is a 600-store chain and Walmart is also working with a Sushi concept in its home state of Arkansas and a concept called Ghost Kitchens which allows customers to order food from other restaurants.

It’s also in discussions with Domino’s to add more locations to its existing 30 eateries inside Walmart locations the company said. The pizza chain however had to convince Walmart that it wouldn’t hurt Walmart’s frozen pizza business according to The Journal.

Citing the Wall Street Journal Forbes reports that though shoppers could eat at McDonald’s in more than 800 Walmart stores across the country just a few days ago by the end of summer McDonald’s will be an option at just 150 Walmart stores.

And yes the COVID-19 pandemic has a lot to do with this change.

Less foot traffic at Walmart

USA Today reports that McDonald’s announced it’d be closing Walmart locations back in July of 2020 as fewer people were shopping at brick-and-mortar stores.

The two have been in business together for about 30 years reported CNBC.

But the pandemic isn’t the only reason for the closures. Forbes reports that the restaurants were never as profitable as stand-alone stores because there is no drive-up at a Walmart McDonald’s.

As McDonald’s leaves Walmart others could take its place

There’s good news for those who like to eat at Walmart before or after they shop. Forbes reported that Walmart may expand existing Taco Bell and Dominoes Pizza franchises in its stores.

And Walmart may also experiment with the space left behind by McDonald’s stores in the form of local shops catering to regional retail needs.

Photographer

Formerly of Los Alamos

As we wander about our wonderful country we try to research the areas we travel in hopes of enjoying and appreciating the place and the people more deeply. Being a photographer I continually see and hear of “things” that we want to see or check out as we travel.

Any time I hear about the “world’s largest” or the “world’s oldest” or any number of titles that may set a place apart from others my ears perk up especially if it falls under the broad heading of “Americana”. I enjoy seeing and reading about the places and things that make this country what it is today.

On our recent trip to California one of the sites falling under the ‘oldest’ category caught my attention. The oldest McDonald’s Restaurant is in California. That’s all it took I had to go! Located on the corner of Florence Avenue and Lakewood Boulevard in Downey Calif. stands the oldest operating McDonald’s. This location opened in 1953. It has operated continuously except when it was closed following the Northridge Earthquake in 1994. This was the third McDonald’s location when it opened in 1953. The earlier locations no longer exist.

Everything about the appearance of this McDonald’s is unique compared to the restaurants we see today. Instead of two arches this location boasts a single arch standing 60-feet high. Near the top of the arch a large section of signage protrudes horizontally with a white background and large red letters reading HAMBURGERS. Seen walking across the horizontal portion is the original McDonald’s mascot Chef Speedee. The McDonald’s name appears much lower on the arch a few feet off of the ground.

The building is mid-century style architecture with windows across the front for customers to walk up and place orders.

In the 1990s a second structure was built next to the existing building to provide indoor dining. A small museum also was included which showed many very early McDonald’s historical items. It wasn’t until 1916 that a drive-thru was added to this location. The restaurant was open for food sales the day we visited but the indoor dining was still closed. I guess I will have to make another visit!

About McDonald’s

In 1917 15-year-old Ray Kroc lied about his age to join the Red Cross as an ambulance driver but the war ended before he completed his training according to the McDonald’s website. He then worked as a piano player a paper cup salesman and a multimixer salesman.

In 1954 he visited a restaurant in San Bernardino Calif. that had purchased several multimixers. There he found a small but successful restaurant run by brothers Dick and Mac McDonald and was stunned by the effectiveness of their operation. The McDonald’s brothers produced a limited menu concentrating on just a few items – burgers fries and beverages – which allowed them to focus on quality and quick service.

They were looking for a new franchising agent and Kroc saw an opportunity. In 1955 he founded McDonald’s System Inc. a predecessor of the McDonald’s Corporation and six years later bought the exclusive rights to the McDonald’s name and operating system. By 1958 McDonald’s had sold its 100 millionth hamburger.

Editor’s note: Longtime Los Alamos photographer Gary Warren and his wife Marilyn are traveling around the country and he shares his photographs which appear in the ‘Posts from the Road’ series published in the Sunday edition of the Los Alamos Daily Post.

Even if the golden arches look familiar what's available inside the fast-food chain is far from it. While you can always count on a signature Big Mac fries and Coke being on the menu each country boasts its unique items in addition to the classics.

From shrimp burgers to chocolate French fries there's more to McDonald's than meets the eye—and whether we'd eat these international McDonald's foods or not they sure are fun to look at.

Bacon Macaroni And Cheese Toastie

Where You Can Get It: Hong Kong (previously)

In 2017 McDonald's threw bacon-infused mac and cheese onto a sandwich. Macaroni and cheese already belongs on our list of the unhealthiest foods on the planet and adding two pieces of toasted bread into the mix didn't do the sandwich any favors. It's probably a good thing this is no longer on the McDonald's Hong Kong menu.

Ham N' Egg Twisty Pasta

Where You Can Get It: Hong Kong

Speaking of the McDonald's Hong Kong Menu though there are a lot of fun options that are still available and are way different from what you'll find in the States. You might not expect to find pasta on a breakfast menu (or on any McDonald's menu) but this one looks too delightful to resist! Not into ham? This breakfast option can also come with sausage and egg toppings or with grilled chicken as a lunch item.

Chicken & Egg Burger

Where You Can Get It: Hong Kong

Until recently you had to hack the McDonald's menu to get chicken and egg on the same sandwich in the States. (Now you can add an egg to the breakfast chicken sandwich at the chain.) But the McDonald's Hong Kong menu features chicken and a fresh egg all in one sandwich. Yum!

Iced Milk Tea

Where You Can Get It: Hong Kong

Milk tea isn't as popular in the States as it is in other countries. But for places that take their tea seriously McDonald's is there to help! You can also get hot tea with lemon and even hot water with lemon at McDonald's locations in Hong Kong.

McFloat

Where You Can Get It: Hong Kong

Seriously why do we not have this in the U.S.? McDonald's creamy soft-serve is just begging to be made into a Coke float. Not into dairy? McDonald's Hong Kong also serves lemon coke which is what it sounds like: soda with fresh lemon slices.

Tomato & Mozzarella Turnovers

Where You Can Get It: Italy

These turnovers—or panzerotti as they're known in Italy—look like something you might find in the freezer aisle not in a McDonald's. We'd try these if we were in Europe.

Gratin Croquette Burger

Where You Can Get It: Japan (seasonally)

Just like the McRib the Gratin Croquette Burger isn't available year-round. But unlike the McRib this creamy crispy cult classic is made up of a fried crab and macaroni croquette between two steamed buns. It can only be purchased during the winter months which is probably for the best as it's like biting into a whole lot of wheat flour with a side of shredded lettuce.

Poutine

Where You Can Get It: Canada

You may not have heard of poutine but covering French fries in gravy and cheese curds is a Canadian staple—and McDonald's has jumped on board the trend. Although McDonald's regular fries rank pretty well on our list of the best fast-food fries this version wouldn't make the cut.

Mashed Potato Burger

Where You Can Get It: China

If you've ever eaten a burger at Mickey D's and thought it was missing something maybe all it needed was a scoop of mashed potatoes. As part of their Manly Man campaign in 2012 McDonald's China gave that a go. Because who wouldn't want to try fitting their mouth around a burger with two beef patties bacon and mashed potatoes? Oh wait… us.

And whatever you do steer clear of these 14 Menu Items McDonald's Employees Won't Eat.

Banana Shake

Where You Can Get It: Japan

Minions are popular the world over and there are several Minions-themed treats on the McDonald's Japan dessert menu. There's the banana Mac Shake as well as waffle cones with minion-printed wrappers. Banana milkshakes are on the menu at McDonald's Great Britain and McDonald's Italy too though they're not Minions-branded.

Baci Perugina McFlurry

Where You Can Get It: Italy

Baci Perugina is a classic brand of Italian chocolate so it's only natural that it would be blended into McFlurry treats in Italian McDonald's locations.

McLobster

Where You Can Get It: Canada (previously)

As if maple bacon poutine wasn't enough Mcdonald's Canada also thought it'd be a good idea to add a lobster roll sandwich to their menu. Because anyone stepping into a fast food place is looking to order lobster right? Wrong. Even if you may have been brave enough to try this the chain had to discontinue the summer staple due to rising lobster prices.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Cadbury Creme Egg McFlurry

Where You Can Get It: Australia Canada United Kingdom

Here in the states Easter at McDonald's means a minty Shamrock Shake. But overseas and across the Canadian border spring comes with a McFlurry flavor that tastes just like a Cadbury Creme Egg. The signature vanilla soft serve is topped with egg fondant sauce and chocolate pieces. Yep we're planning a road trip.

McChicken Mozzarella

Where You Can Get It: Korea

Have you ever wished you could order a McDonald's chicken sandwich with mozzarella sticks on top? Well your wish is McDonald's Korea's command.

Sweet Corn

Where You Can Get It: Japan

Cordon Bleu Burger

Where You Can Get It: Poland (previously)

How much meat can you possibly cram between two onion buns? The Cordon Bleu Burger tried to answer this question by piling bacon a beef patty and a fried chicken patty stuffed with ham one on top of the other. Arteries it was nice knowing you.

Bacon Roll

Where You Can Get It: United Kingdom

It's unclear whether this item is for picky eaters or for someone who just really loves bacon. The Bacon Roll is exactly what it sounds like: bacon on bread along with ketchup or brown sauce.

Black And White Burgers

Where You Can Get It: China (previously)

What's black and white and odd all over? The half-sized Black and White Burgers at McDonald's China named for their colored buns. The black one was dyed with squid ink and the white one was covered in black sesame seeds. And although you may have thought they were burgers the white one is just a fried chicken sandwich. What they do have in common is a scoop of mashed potatoes and slices of bacon because the sandwiches weren't already weird enough.

Pizza McPuff

Where You Can Get It: India

We have to hand it to McDonald's India for the name of this side dish alone. This Hot Pockets-style treat is stuffed with vegetables tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese.

NYC Benedict Bagel

Where You Can Get It: New Zealand

What do you get when you cross brunch with McDonald's? A bacon egg and cheese bagel sandwich dripping with Hollandaise sauce. Eggs Benedict is usually served open-faced so we have no idea why this sandwich is topped either.

McRice Burger

Where You Can Get It: Indonesia Philippines Singapore Taiwan (previously)

Even though you can only find regular buns and English muffins on the menu now McDonald's Singapore used to sandwich its burgers between sticky rice patties. The McRice Burger was discontinued but in its heyday it held beef fried fish or fried chicken.

Sweety con Nutella

Where You Can Get It: Italy (previously)

Dubbed the Sweety this dessert's name doesn't lie. As much as it looks like a hamburger from afar it was just two pieces of soft bread slathered with Nutella. It's no longer on the McDonald's Italy menu but there is a similar treat: McCrunchy Bread with Nutella.

McKroket

Where You Can Get It: Netherlands

Feeling like knocking out your entire daily salt intake in one sitting? In that case the McKroket's got you covered. This burger doesn't look that threatening at first glance—it only consists of a croquette and mustard sauce. But there's beef stew inside the croquette that's doing a lot of damage. So unless sodium is what you're after avoid this McDonald's Netherland staple.

Spicy Paneer Wrap

Where You Can Get It: India

This wrap features fried paneer a popular curd cheese in South Asia but there is even more cheese melted on top along with veggies and a creamy sauce. It's vegetarian but it's not healthier than the meatier options on the McDonald's menu.

McToast Chocolate

Where You Can Get It: Germany (previously)

McToast Ham McToast Cheese McToast Bacon McToast… Chocolate? Most of us prefer savory flavors in the morning but if chocolate's what you're after in the a.m. McDonald's Germany once had a toasted wheat flatbread folded over milk chocolate on the breakfast menu. It's not on the menu anymore but you can still get savory McToasts as well as a single-serve Nutella packet to spread on a McCroissant.

Chicken McDo With Spaghetti

Where You Can Get It: Philippines

McNoodles

Where You Can Get It: Austria (previously)

In 2012 McDonald's spent 18 months developing an Asian-inspired dish to sell in Austria as a limited-time test dish. They imported the ingredients from Thailand adding veggies chicken salad and sweet-and-sour or curry sauce to bowls of noodles. They called the whole thing McNoodles—shocker.

We're all familiar with the disappointing feeling of coming to the end of our carton of McDonald's French fries. Try as you might to savor those warm and deliciously crispy potato sticks like all good things the salty treat does have to come to an end.

Despite the fast-food giant's French fries being their best-selling item (via Business Insider) and widely considered the best in the biz the chain has yet to catch on to some of the practices implemented by some other restaurant chains that tend to over-serve the savory snack to their loyal customers. In fact a few entries in a Reddit thread from former employees went as far as suggesting that McDonald's isn't even giving you the proper amount of fries in the first place but rather skimping you on your order. If so that's so not cool!

The thread was posted three years ago and posed the question to workers about what their jobs asked them to hide from customers. In response one former Mickey D's employee revealed that they were given specific instructions for how to ""pinch a fry carton just right"" to give it the illusion that it looked full. The trick appeared to have worked as the Redditor said they were only ever called out on the French fry scam by a single customer."

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck raises 2024 profit forecast on surging sales of cancer drug Keytruda,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-raises-2024-profit-forecast-strong-cancer-hpv-drugs-sales-2024-04-25/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."

The latest action has not stopped the prime minister as he keeps posting on the social media platform where he has 3.5 million followers.

The United States and others have warned Ethiopia about ``dehumanizing rhetoric_'' after the prime minister in comments in July described the Tigray forces as ``cancer'' and ``weeds.''_

This is not the first time Facebook has removed posts published by world leaders. Earlier this year the company deleted a video from U.S. President Donald Trump in which he peddled false claims about election fraud following a deadly skirmish at the U.S. Capitol. Facebook said at the time the video contributed to ``the risk of ongoing violence.''

Just last week the tech platform yanked a live broadcast from Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro because he made false claims about the COVID-19 vaccines.

Alarmed Abiy's government this week declared a national state of emergency with sweeping powers of detention and military conscription. The prime minister repeated his call to ``bury'' the Tigray forces in public comments on Wednesday as he and other officials marked one year of war.

Meanwhile Ethiopia's highly polarized social media this week saw a number of high-profile posts targeting ethnic Tigrayans and even suggesting they be placed in concentration camps.

Thousands of people have been killed in the war between Ethiopian and allied forces and the Tigray ones who long dominated the national government before Abiy took office.

The United Nations human rights chief said Wednesday they had received reports of thousands of ethnic Tigrayans being rounded up for detention in recent months.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I have to go all the way back to you playing pool. What was that about?

I did it for about a year. I played in the American Pool Association in a bar pool league in New York City while I was working in finance and I absolutely loved it. I’m very competitive so it was a great way for me to release some steam as well.

Rina your journey is so incredible from McKinsey to MetLife Harvard Business School and CEO of Dacha Prime.

I graduated high school during the start of the financial crisis so I thought “Wow that is a very interesting problem; how did it happen that this went below the radar for so long by so many smart people?” That's what really interested me in the finance industry. I worked for McKinsey right after college for a period of three years and I was their credit analyst. I had a blast. My mentor there I still talk to him today. It’s always about the people. It’s about the people you surround yourself with.

What does a credit analyst do?

It’s just a different way of making money in the financial markets and credit default swaps were the big thing in 2008 which blew up because they were essentially insurance products on bonds. I loved working in finance. I thought they were really interesting problems but I realized when you work in finance you're not really working as much with people. So that’s what drew me to consider business school. It changes your life when you can not only be exposed to so many different people so many different ideas but you can try new things. I went into business school thinking maybe I’ll actually start my own finance firm. I decided I wanted to work with people so I went and did a summer internship with MetLife in their global leadership development program.

Harvard Business School is not ordinary business school. Why is it so life changing?

I came into Harvard Business School with this idea about staying in finance and then I got exposed to so many different people so many new ideas. Entrepreneurship for me was something scary; it was something totally unknown. At business school was where I actually started realizing what entrepreneurship was; I saw many different kinds of examples and I saw that it was attainable and reachable for myself in new ways. I’m now an entrepreneur and I am so so happy. My life happiness has increased I don’t even know how much. I owe so much to that school.

Talk to me a little bit about what you are doing today with 280 Group.

At business school I learned something very interesting which was entrepreneurship through acquisition. My husband is a founder and they have to be passionate about what they’re working on because it is nonstop hard work. I decided I am not sure exactly what I am passionate about yet but there is a way for me to become an entrepreneur. That’s by finding a business that’s been around for many years which has already had product-market fit so it’s de-risked and I can learn so much from the owner and founder. There’s a lot of founders who don’t think about an exit strategy and when they meet someone like me they realize that it could be a match. It could protect their legacy.

At 280 Group we do product management training and consulting. We are the world’s only company that I know that does both and those two elements are so important. In the summer I worked at MetLife in their office of innovation I was trying to figure out how entrepreneurship works at a large enterprise. They did not understand what agile methodology was. I actually gave a presentation on that and it was so hard to be innovative. That’s why 280 Group is so powerful. In a large company the way those companies were built decision making is built at the top. When you’re thinking about the ways companies innovate today that decision making really needs to be done on the front line. Product managers who are talking to consumers and are also getting information from customer support from sales from all of these other areas on the front line need to be able to make clear decisions about resources and allocating those resources. At 280 Group we work with these companies and we hire people who love product management. We know that product management has really evolved and continues to evolve over time and the demand for product management is outpacing supply. We know that this means that many people who actually end up in product management don’t come with a background of having experience. We found that just training people I’m not even talking about my training just letting people know what is product management and what do you do at each stage of the product life cycle helps increase skills by 11%. If you have a process that increases skills by 30%. And if you do both 44%. We don’t want to come in and train we want to come in and change.

But how does that actually work Rina? How do you integrate into these companies to quickly provide the value and assimilate well enough to be able to move the needle?

I’m going to push back on the word “quick” there because it’s not quick. If you are looking for a quick solution to something that does not have a quick solution it’s not going to work. For a single team we can have a quick one but if we’re talking about an organizational level it can be many years. We do not come in to the organization saying “We’re going to now make you all follow our optimal product process.” What we do instead is spend the first two three months of our engagement talking to all the people who touch product management. We’re going to spend time getting to know you. We’re going to take a look at your documents. This is actually a really huge source of information. Then we produce a report essentially a gap assessment where we provide what we saw what can be improved and a roadmap. We customize our training to include their terminology focus on the elements that we’ve identified that need the most support and whenever possible we try to bring people outside of product management into the training as well.

I’d love to pick your brain on where we are headed with product management as a discipline?

The tools that product managers have has increased and there’s a lot more demands from the product management function at any organization. There are a lot of tools now that allow product managers to analyze that information quicker to be able to provide much more rapid change.

I think the biggest challenge up ahead is the signal versus noise issue with having all of this data. It really stems from the top from having a really clear cut product strategy that allows them to make prioritization decisions even with larger amounts of data.

What are three words you would use to describe yourself?

Kind. That is not the same as nice. I love people and I love seeing their potential so I approach people with this positive mind-set and I try to be kind. My best friend probably describes me as brave and I think that has to do with my willingness to solve hairy problems and challenges. And I am competitive. I love challenges I love problems and I love competing.

Over the years members of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band have gotten into some pretty diverse careers far outside their genre and in some cases outside the world of music. In the late '90s E Street Band guitarist Steven Van Zandt ended up with a very prominent role as Silvio Dante on HBO's The Sopranos. In the early '90s Max Weinberg got a gig playing drums and leading the band on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. However before Weinberg sat in on drums for the E Street Band there was drummer Vini ""Mad Dog"" Lopez Springsteen's original drummer per The New York Times. Lopez who left the band after their first two albums ended up becoming a professional golf caddie.

Lopez was nicknamed ""Mad Dog"" because of his unpredictable temper though his change in careers was just as unpredictable. Before Lopez would become a professional golf caddie the former E Street drummer would end up being fired by Springsteen. ""At that point I didn't think the band was going to go too far and I didn't care either"" Lopez told The Times. ""I made a few mistakes you know everybody makes mistakes. I still thought it was my band.""

When Lopez left the E Street band he ended up becoming a caddie master at the Deal Golf and Country Club per NJ 1015. Years later Lopez became the caddie for Pro Golfer Mark McCormick of Union New Jersey. Lopez would help McCormick qualify for the U.S. Open in 2012.",https://news.google.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_YW1wPXRydWU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina recently inaugurated the USBangladesh Business Council to boost bilateral trade and investment,Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina recently inaugurated the US-Bangladesh Business Council to boost bilateral trade and investment between the United States and Bangladesh.

Steve Sisolak to open Allegiant Stadium at full capacity this season.

MGM Resorts president and CEO Bill Hornbuckle said Saturday the company is working with Gov. Steve Sisolak to open Allegiant Stadium at full capacity.

“I know this fall we’ll have a full stadium for the Raiders” Hornbuckle said. “I’m hoping by July Fourth weekend the community is in a place where we can just do what we normally do and have some fun.”

If Allegiant Stadium gets the green light to operate at full capacity by July the first major event on the stadium’s calendar is a Garth Brooks concert on July 10th. The concert originally was scheduled for February 2020 and sold out the 65000 seats within 75 minutes.

Raiders president Marc Badain said he shared Hornbuckle’s optimism and said the club will adhere to the recommendations of state leaders.

“We’ll listen to the authorities on that and the medical community” Badain said. “Obviously everybody wants to get back to live events both in Las Vegas and around the world.”

That said Badain and the Raiders are eager to welcome fans to their new home. The exhibition season begins in August. The regular season kicks off the second weekend of September.

“As soon as we get the go-ahead our plan is to open the place up and pack it and bring people to town and have it be the economic stimulus that everybody thought it was going to be” Badain said.

Because of the global pandemic the Raiders’ first season in Las Vegas unfolded in an empty stadium. Raiders owner Mark Davis not wanting any fans to be shut out of the experience decided not to allow any fans to attend any of his club’s home games until full capacity was allowed.

UNLV’s football team also plays its home games at Allegiant Stadium and welcomed 2000 fans to each of its two games. The Rebels are scheduled to play six games at Allegiant Stadium in 2021.

“I think very soon we’ll begin to see the next stage” Hornbuckle said. “We are all watching obviously what happens in the community in terms of infection rates ultimately what happens in the ICU ward.

“All of that being said we’re trending in the right direction.”

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said last month the league expects that stadiums across the country will be operating at full capacity.

“All of us in the NFL want to see every one of our fans back” Goodell said. “Football is simply not the same without fans. We expect to have full stadiums in the upcoming season.”

However it appears that 2021 could be a different story for the Raider Nation faithful.

COVID-19 affected every facet of day-to-day life since its outbreak and professional sports weren’t exempt. While most of the major American sports leagues such as the NFL continued to do business it was different. The loss of fans affected the feel for the games. Cardboard cutouts just aren’t the same nor can they replace a live audience’s energy. It’s especially true for the Raiders; one of the most rabid and passionate fanbases had to watch everything from their homes. Nevertheless there’s some good news and change could be on the horizon next season.

Will The Raiders Welcome Back Its Fans In 2021?

Vincent Bonsignore of the Las Vegas Review-Journal recently helped shed light on how the fan experience might return. Via MGM Resorts President and CEO Bill Hornbuckle there have been some dealings in trying to get Raider Nation into Allegiant Stadium.

â€œI know this fall we’ll have a full stadium for the Raiders. The governor is working on it. I think very soon we’ll begin to see the next stage.”

Hornbuckle commented in Bonsignore’s article that Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak is actively working with his company on the matter. The CEO is hard at work trying to make sure that the state-of-the-art facility opens up at full capacity by July. He also alluded to the fact that a lot hinges on current trends with regards to the pandemic. The vaccine is slowly becoming widely available as we move forward but caution should still be exercised. If indeed things stay the course Raider Nation could indeed end up filling the seats of Allegiant Stadium next season.

John Colletti 56 of Harper Woods Michigan has a sentencing hearing on July 7 after making his plea on Tuesday. He could face more than 20 years in prison.

Colletti’s identity-theft and fraud spree began in April 2019 and continued until March 2020 when he was arrested in Kansas. Most of Colletti’s thefts occurred at Detroit’s MGM Grand casino and other Michigan properties. In each instance Colletti donned a prosthetic face mask that made him appear older while adding to the disguise with a hat glasses and the like.

Colletti’s spree resulted in the theft of at least $125740 which he was ordered to repay to the ATMs’ owner and operator Global Payments Gaming Services Inc. (GPGS). Most of his thefts — nearly $100K worth — came during several weeks in April and May of 2019. All the victims were members of GPGS’s VIP Preferred Program and the company had already refunded individual victims for the thefts from their banking accounts.

Stolen IDs purchased online

The MGM Grand in Detroit quickly realized it had a serial thief on its hands identifying the likely fraudster via security footage. The case began with the Michigan State Police and eventually involved the FBI which was able to track back the victims’ common theme.

The FBI eventually determined that Colletti purchased the IDs of his victims on the internet then created fake drivers licenses and other identification to gain access to their accounts in the GPGS system.

Investigators recovered roughly 300 forged IDs with Colletti’s prosthetic-mask image as its photo following his arrest. On a flash drive recovered in Kansas where he was arrested authorities also found a spreadsheet with identifying information for over 1000 would-be victims.

Colletti ditched prosthetic mask in restroom

Colletti’s March 2020 arrest at the Prairie Band Casino and Resort in Mayetta Kansas included a foiled escape attempt. By that time images of Colletti in his “old man” disguise had likely been circulated to casinos across the country (though that was not confirmed in press reports) and Prairie Band security quickly ID’d the suspected fraudster who had already made several ATM withdrawals.

The security guards confronted Colletti and asked him to return to the cashier but on the way there Colletti veered into a restroom where he attempted to ditch his disguise. He removed his prosthetic mask an outer layer of clothes including a straw hat a walker two fake Michigan drivers licenses and approximately $11000 of the $20000 he had already withdrawn from the casino’s ATMs.

Security also recovered a key to a rented Nissan car where authorities found additional items linking Colletti to the thefts including a flash drive and four more prosthetic masks among other incriminating items. He was quickly identified to MGM Grand Detroit and to the authorities investigating the Michigan frauds who confirmed his likely identity. Following Colletti’s arrest he was extradited back to Michigan to face the charges there.

Timothy Waters special agent in charge of the FBI’s Detroit Field Office said “John Colletti stole the identities of dozens of innocent people dragging them all into his criminal scheme. The impacts of identity theft are serious and far-reaching for victims and the FBI will work hard to ensure anyone who engages in this type of conduct is held accountable.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhc2luby5vcmcvdml0YWx2ZWdhcy9wbGF6YS1wb2RjYXN0LXNoZWRzLWxpZ2h0LW9uLWZyZW1vbnQtc3RyZWV0LWhpc3RvcnktYW5kLWdsb3Jpb3VzLWRyYW1hL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plaza Podcast Sheds Light on Fremont Street History and Glorious Drama,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.casino.org', port=443): Read timed out.

Amid a semiconductor chip shortage Micron Technology (MU 4.73%) stock has experienced one of its best runs in many years. Its stock price has almost returned to its all-time high of $97.50 per share a point it has not achieved since the height of the dot-com boom in 2000. Given its history investors should question whether Micron is in the midst of a long-term boom or if the run is merely a reaction to the chip shortage.

Where Micron stands

Micron is one of a select group of stocks that have been helped by the pandemic. Chip foundries were temporarily shuttered in 2020 even as the increased need for remote work led to a demand surge in chips. To meet this market need the company has taken its production to full capacity amid an environment of rising memory prices.

Micron remains one of the major players in the NAND or flash memory market. According to TrendForce Micron is the third-largest player in the NAND market with a market share of about 14%.

Still its most impactful competitive advantage lies in its position in the DRAM market. The company is one of only three producers of DRAM chips which made up 68% of company revenue in 2020. TrendForce reports that Micron held 23% of the DRAM market as of the end of 2020. And the fact that it became one of the top 20 patent registrants in 2020 points to a commitment to maintain and deepen its edge.

Micron also continues to benefit from a much larger trend. In past years it made memory primarily for PCs. However its memory business has recently experienced an exponential demand surge as artificial intelligence virtual reality data centers smartphones and other devices come to rely on its chips.

Micron's financials

This secular demand increase has helped make downturns less extreme. In the more distant past slumps in the chip market led to losses such as the one suffered in fiscal 2016. But the company kept itself profitable even amid falling earnings in 2019 and 2020.

Now rising demand and shortages have had positive effects on financials. For the first six months of fiscal 2021 revenue increased by about 21% compared to the first six months of fiscal 2020. Over the same period net income surged 54% as operating expenses experienced only a 5% increase.

Micron only offered financial projections for the upcoming quarter. Still the $6.9 billion to $7.3 billion of revenue predicted dramatically exceeds the $5.4 billion the company brought in during the same quarter in 2020. Moreover the company raised its sales forecast for both DRAM and NAND memory for all of fiscal 2021. It predicts DRAM sales will experience a 20% increase from last year's levels with NAND sales to grow in the low to mid-30% range during the same period.

Despite positive earnings Micron reported negative free cash flow of $642 million. This happened because it invested almost $5.8 billion in additional property plants and equipment an understandable move given the rising chip demand. Moreover since the company holds about $6.5 billion in cash the $42 million quarterly interest expenses and the $6.6 billion in combined current and long-term debt should not concern stockholders.

Additionally the stock has more than doubled over the last 12 months. Micron stock has a long history of moving with memory prices. For this reason its recent increase should not come as a surprise.

However that trend can also apply in times of low demand. Shares fell to the $10-per-share range during the 2016 downturn. Conditions have improved as the need for memory has expanded beyond PCs however. Consequently Micron did not fall far below $30 per share at the height of the downturn that began in 2018. Nonetheless the stock's sensitivity to memory prices remains and shareholders should stay aware of that fact as Micron nears record highs.

Should I buy Micron?

Many assume that Micron stock is a buy due to the chip shortage.

Still investors shouldn't forget that Micron stock remains a proxy for memory prices. Micron released a sales outlook for all of 2021 but did not provide a financial outlook beyond the upcoming quarter. This may point to this uncertainty regarding the price of memory.

Moreover when chip demand finally falls Micron stock price will likely experience a massive drop. This should give long-term investors second thoughts about buying this chip stock at current levels.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3Ivd3d3L3RlY2gvMjAyNC8wNC8xMjlfMzA2OTU0Lmh0bWzSAT9odHRwczovL20ua29yZWF0aW1lcy5jby5rci9wYWdlcy9hcnRpY2xlLmFtcC5hc3A_bmV3c0lkeD0zMDY5NTQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,White House meeting to speed up Samsung's US investment,"Samsung Electronics' chip-making plant in Hwaseong Gyeonggi Province / Courtesy of Samsung Electronics

A Samsung Electronics official confirmed that company officials will attend the meeting but declined to elaborate. It is reported that Choi Si-young chief of Samsung's foundry business will attend the meeting virtually. But the Samsung official added the company cannot confirm who else will attend the meeting between executives of global companies and White House officials.



Samsung is the only Korean company to be invited to the meeting along with other big name companies such as Intel Micron Technology TSMC Google AT&T General Motors Ford and NXP.



White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the meeting will be led by National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese as part of the Biden administration's efforts to resolve the shortage of semiconductors.



The meeting comes amid a worsening global chip shortage and is forecast to set the direction of the semiconductor and other industries as the U.S. places more importance on them to counter China's rising influence through technological development.



The global economy is struggling with a semiconductor shortage due to soaring demand for IT devices triggered by a surge in telecommuting and online classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The chip supply chain has begun to show its vulnerability as semiconductor companies have also been hit hard by bad weather and natural disasters.



The U.S. has been trying to boost local chip production to compete with China. In line with such efforts U.S. chip giant Intel announced a $20 billion investment plan last month to build two new chip-manufacturing factories in the state of Arizona and open up its plants to outside customers.



Foundry business leader TSMC already unveiled plans last year to build a $12 billion chip plant in Arizona this year and Samsung also has requested the authorities in Texas to grant tax incentives for over 20 years which would be worth around $805.5 million for its new $17 billion chip factory in Austin.



""The White House will put its priority on protecting its local industry through the meeting with officials of the companies but the Biden administration will probably not appear empty-handed. The U.S. government will likely share opportunities and benefits for win-win outcomes"" an industry analyst who declined to be named said.

The last order date is set for June 30 2021 with the last shipment date of September 30 2021. Intel is in the middle of a technology transition to its new DDR4-3200/ PCIe Gen4 portfolio. Still with recent reports that Micron is abandoning 3D XPoint Intel could have used some messaging on this one.

Intel Optane DC P4800X with Memory Drive Technology Discontinued

Here are the Intel Optane DC P4800X with Memory Drive Technology being discontinued:

As one can see these are both the add-in card and U.2 variants of the drives. These are also the single and 10-packs of the SSDs.

Along with the P4800X bundle end-of-life (EOL) we also see that the Intel Memory Drive Technology support is being discontinued this is probably a blow to Intel’s partner ScaleMP here as Intel is using ScaleMP’s technology for this:

For those who are not familiar with Intel Memory Drive Technology it is actually something that was likely more used on client PCs than servers. When Intel pushed the launch of the Optane DIMMs yet forged ahead with the launch of Optane in SSD form the basic idea was that Intel would use fast DC P4800X PCIe SSDs as a way to extend memory capacity. Hot data would be written to DRAM but then could be pushed to the slower SSD tier. That is similar to the Intel Optane Memory for the desktop offering just on a larger scale.

For STH readers you may have read our Glorious Complexity of Intel Optane DIMMs and Micron Exiting 3D XPoint article and will notice that there are conceptual similarities between how Intel Memory Drive Technology and the Optane DIMMs operate in Memory Mode.

Since Intel is EOL’ing the drives it makes sense that the software that goes along with the drives is also being discontinued since it carries a 5-year support period.

Final Words

It is fairly normal for Intel to discontinue its SSDs and offerings over time. The Optane DC P5800X is much faster so if one had to choose one would pick the P5800X over the P4800X. As a result we can see why Intel would discontinue the older drive with Memory Technology. In SSDs the biggest cost is the media so using 3D XPoint packages in either product one would prefer them in the new PCIe Gen4 SSD. At the same time given the P4800X’s cost the drive is going to be found in sensitive high-value applications. For STH readers this is one we would suggest taking a look at to ensure you have spares and warranty/ support coverage for any that are currently deployed especially if you would have a challenge from a policy perspective around using a different but newer model.

While the consumer drives have effectively been discontinued as well we still have the P4801X M.2 and U.2 versions as current-generation drives but those seem like they will be imminently replaced.

For the Memory Drive Technology the big question is whether we get broader software models for CXL-based memory pools and persistent memory. Time will tell on that one. Still perhaps most interesting is that one can use ScaleMP’s software alongside standard NVMe SSDs albeit with a different level of performance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vYmVlYm9tLmNvbS9zZWFnYXRlLXNoaXBwZWQtMy16ZXR0YWJ5dGVzLW9mLWRhdGEtc3RvcmFnZS1zaW5jZS1pbmNlcHRpb24v0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly9iZWVib20uY29tL3NlYWdhdGUtc2hpcHBlZC0zLXpldHRhYnl0ZXMtb2YtZGF0YS1zdG9yYWdlLXNpbmNlLWluY2VwdGlvbi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seagate Has Shipped 3 Zettabytes of Data Storage Since Its Inception,"After developing the first 5.25-inch hard-disk drive (HDD) back in 1980 Seagate has come a long way in the computer industry. Now the company sells internal external and portable storage drives and competes with giants like Micron Technology Western Digital (WD) and Samsung. Recently Seagate announced that it has shipped over 3 Zettabytes (ZB) of data storage products since its inception.

This is a significant milestone that the data storage giant achieved after operating for over 42 years. It crossed the 1 Zettabyte milestone back in 2014 which was 36 years after its inception. However the company reached the 2 zettabytes milestone only after 4 years. But here comes the most surprising number the company has announced that it has surpassed the 3 zettabyte milestone in March 2021. It took Seagate only 2 years to sell the next zettabyte of storage products.

How Much is 3ZB of Storage?

Now as you can tell 3ZB of storage is much more than you can ever imagine. To give you an idea you can store 1.5 quadrillion selfies or 30 billion 4K movies or 7.5 trillion MP3 songs in 3ZB of storage. However if you look at it from a macro level it is not that much storage!

A recent International Data Corporation (IDC) report estimated that the sum of global data generated by 2025 will exponentially accelerate to 175 zettabytes. This is 58 times more than the amount of data storage shipped by the company to date.

Besides with more and more “smart” things around us Seagate says that more data is being generated in a single hour than what was being generated in an entire year about 20 years ago. Today a single self-driving car produces up to 32 terabytes (TB) of data in a day and Seagate estimates that a smart city can generate up to 2.5 petabytes (PB) worth of day in one day. Well 3 zettabytes does not seem like a big number now does it?

Moreover as per IDC companies and enterprises on average only use 32% of the data for their day-to-day operations. The rest 68% data simply sits and hogs the digital storage space.

So to keep up with the rapid pace of data creation in today’s world Seagate states that it will continue to innovate storage solutions for clients and consumers. In addition the company claims to improve its open standards-based storage system and software and its Lyve edge-to-cloud mass storage platform. This aims to help companies and enterprises cut the cost and complications of managing data at scale.",,,

UA’s Office of Information Technology (OIT) is transitioning all UA student emails from Google to Microsoft Outlook on May 7 thru May 9.

According to OIT’s announcement all email addresses and passwords will remain the same and the process will be conducted entirely by the University.

The office advises students to familiarize themselves with Outlook prior to the move by utilizing the tutorials available on their site.

Once the migration is complete the new email is accessible through outlook.office.com and the Outlook app which is available on phones and desktops.

While many students are still unaware of the impending switch others express a preference for Google and an overall sense of confusion.

“I don’t really know why [we’re switching] so it feels very unnecessary” said Liana Taylor a junior majoring in biology.

In addition to feeling uncertain about why the email change is happening some students would just rather not start using Outlook instead.

JC Perry a freshman biology major said he prefers Gmail purely because of the comfort it gives.

Some like Taylor even fear that the switch will erase all the current documents they keep under their Google account.

However according to OIT students will still be able to access their Google drive and other relevant applications. If a student wants to transition their materials to Outlook they can do so through the G-suite or Google Takeout but this is not required.

Aside from how students access their email not that much is ultimately changing except for increased access to certain benefits of the Outlook application. However this makes the decision to change email applications even more confusing for some students.

“Why are we changing it if nothing is really changing?” said Addison Parker a freshman majoring in creative media. “What is the purpose?”

The OIT said in their announcement that they made the move for stronger cyber security because “with Crimson email in the Microsoft cloud OIT’s security team will have better ability to block malicious activity preventing a greater number of phishing emails from reaching student inboxes.”

According to their announcement the biggest perk is “full functionality with Microsoft Teams.” Within Microsoft Teams students can hold meetings like Zoom with the added bonuses of making groups and creating chats outside of virtual meetings.

Another main motivation for making the switch is to introduce the platform to students before entering the workforce. Email is the main form of communication in most companies and the Outlook application makes the use of email easy and more efficient.

One data collection website suggests 195801 companies in the United States utilize Microsoft Outlook including SpaceX. In comparison the same website found 4369 companies using Gmail.

According to Meagan Bennett the director of customer relations for the OIT their office suggested making this migration based on student’s experiences using Office 365 in their professional internships.

“Mississippi State had a good experience with the transition” Bennett said. “[We] only wanted to do it if students were interested.”

Other universities to make this transition include Duke University Emory University Thomas Jefferson University University of Iowa and the University of Washington.

After speaking with their board of students the OIT brought the idea to SGA.

Bennett said following the transition there will be a more “cohesive directory” as well since the University currently uses multiple email environment’s including Office 365 for faculty and Gmail for students.

While Bennett said she recognizes the feeling of familiarity students have with Gmail she firmly believes that “being able to use 365 tools made sense for the University from a technological and student perspective.”

“We feel students will have an advantage entering the professional world because they will become more used to [Office 365]” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL2ZpbmFuY2lhbHBvc3QuY29tL3BlcnNvbmFsLWZpbmFuY2UvYnVzaW5lc3MtZXNzZW50aWFscy9vdmVyLTEtYmlsbGlvbi1wZW9wbGUtd29ybGR3aWRlLXVzZS1hLW1zLW9mZmljZS1wcm9kdWN0LW9yLXNlcnZpY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Over 1 billion people worldwide use a MS Office product or service,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://financialpost.com/personal-finance/business-essentials/over-1-billion-people-worldwide-use-a-ms-office-product-or-service on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL2ZpbmFuY2lhbHBvc3QuY29tL3BlcnNvbmFsLWZpbmFuY2UvYnVzaW5lc3MtZXNzZW50aWFscy9vdmVyLTEtYmlsbGlvbi1wZW9wbGUtd29ybGR3aWRlLXVzZS1hLW1zLW9mZmljZS1wcm9kdWN0LW9yLXNlcnZpY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2EzNmRkNDY5LWU1MjEtNGNlNy05MzUxLWRkYzhmNmI1Y2I0MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft buys Nuance in deal giving voice tech pioneer $16bn equity value,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Thousands more have received the first shot in a two-dose vaccine regimen. The vaccines produced by Moderna and Pfizer both require a second dose to reach full effectiveness.

So what changes for fully vaccinated Iowans?

What does the COVID-19 vaccine protect me against? How effective are they?

The major takeaway for all three vaccines available in the United States: They are all ""pretty close to 100%"" effective at preventing the inoculated from becoming severely ill with COVID-19 said Dr. Dan Diekema director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.

Additionally they're about 90% to 95% effective at preventing people from even developing symptoms of the disease he said. They also appear highly effective at preventing illness from the coronavirus variants cropping up around the world and in Iowa though scientists are still studying it for conclusive results.

Scientists are still gathering data about how effective the vaccines are at preventing virus transmission. But early results are promising showing they are 70% to 90% effective at stopping the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

""They're extremely extremely good at protecting the person who received the vaccine but not 100%"" Diekema said in an interview.

But he added we still have to be mindful that the majority of the population has not yet been vaccinated and that many people have conditions that suppress their immune systems potentially diminishing the effectiveness of the vaccine in them.

In response to a Register reader question about immune systems naturally weakening with age Diekema said in an email that vaccine effectiveness is high enough that CDC guidance still applies to older Iowans.

""Even though the immune system does weaken with age the current vaccines remain highly effective at preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19 in older adults (including over 75)"" Diekema wrote.

I'm fully vaccinated. Can life return to normal for me?

Update on May 14:New guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a mask or physically distance in most circumstances. However it advises to continue wearing masks in accordance with state local or business regulations. They can also refrain from routine testing for infection such as due to travel or exposure to an infected person. If they develop COVID symptoms vaccinated people should still seek tests and medical guidance.

Medical professions consider a person fully vaccinated two weeks after completing the vaccine series. That means waiting for two weeks after a person receives the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine or two weeks after they receive their booster shot of Moderna or Pfizer.

But a pandemic is a population-level disaster and Diekema urges people to think of their community when making their decisions. That means you should continue to wear a mask and keep your distance from others in public out of an abundance of caution in case you're carrying the virus but feeling no symptoms as an example. Plus your behavior reinforces the society-wide effort needed to minimize spread of a potentially fatal disease he said.

""Your vaccine is your protection but all the other (mitigation efforts) are population-based community interventions that we all need to continue to adhere to just for a little bit longer until everyone's had a chance to be vaccinated and we're out of this"" Diekema said.

He said he is still watching overall infection rates to gauge virus activity. Those numbers should guide the use of mitigation efforts and the return to normalcy he said. Once vaccinations are more prevalent the infection rate should naturally come down.

That said fully vaccinated Iowans can feel more comfortable doing things they may have been avoiding before he said.

Is it safe to eat indoors at restaurants? What about exercising at the gym or travel?

According to official guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention people who have been fully vaccinated can feel comfortable doing the following:

Visit with other fully vaccinated people — or with unvaccinated people who are not at risk for severe illness — in close quarters without needing a mask.

Travel domestically without pre- or post-travel coronavirus tests and without needing to quarantine afterward

Gather or conduct activities outdoors without wearing a mask except in certain crowded settings and venues. (Added April 27)

Iowa Department of Public Health interim Director Kelly Garcia is deferring to the same guidance for Iowans.

Diekema said he expects the CDC guidance to expand in coming weeks and months to explicitly allow more activities for vaccinated people.

In the meantime Diekema said fully vaccinated people who are otherwise healthy should feel comfortable dining indoors.

They can feel comfortable huffing-and-puffing in an indoor gym as well — though he still recommends people keep their distance and wear a mask while doing so. The mask will keep fully vaccinated people from spreading virus through the air if they are infected.

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds: 'I strongly oppose vaccine passports' will take steps to limit their use

It's been two weeks since my first dose of Moderna or Pfizer. Can I tip-toe back to normalcy?

Even a single dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines confers a degree of protection from COVID-19 an interim CDC study published April 2 showed. But Diekema still encourages people to wait for their second shot before tiptoeing back into pre-pandemic habits.

""The second dose does seem to be quite important"" Diekema said acknowledging that there are varying opinions about it. ""... When we look at antibody levels after dose one and after dose two and immune response after dose two it really does seem to be important to generating the high level of protection that you get after full vaccination.""

He recommended all Iowans who are eligible get vaccinated as soon as they're able.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention second shots should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible but can be given up to 42 days after the first dose if necessary.

Here's when to receive the second dose:

The second Pfizer dose should be given 21 days after your first dose

The second Moderna vaccine dose should be given 28 days later

Though the CDC says second doses should not be administered earlier than the recommended interval those given ""within a grace period of 4 days earlier than the recommended date for the second dose are still considered valid.""

Health care providers will likely schedule the second vaccine dose during the first dose appointment typically with the option of picking another location if necessary.

A new CDC study reported that a single dose of Pfizer's or Moderna's COVID vaccine was 80% effective in preventing infections. That number jumped to 90% two weeks after the second dose the study on vaccinated health care workers showed.

Complete vaccination is said to be two weeks after a person receives their second dose of the two-shot Pfizer and Moderna vaccines according to health officials.

If side effects persist after either dose of the vaccine the CDC recommends people take over-the-counter medicines like ibuprofen acetaminophen aspirin or antihistamines after speaking with a doctor.

The CDC does not recommend however that people take such over-the-counter medications or antihistamines to prevent side effects prior to receiving the coronavirus vaccine.

Health officials noted that it is not known how those medications might affect the efficacy of the vaccine. For people who take medications for underlying medical conditions the CDC recommends to continue taking.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9oZWFsdGgvMjAyMS8wNC8xMC9jb3ZpZC12YWNjaW5lLXdvbWVuLXJlcG9ydC1tb3JlLXNpZGUtZWZmZWN0cy10aGFuLW1lbi1oZXJlcy13aHkvNzEzOTM2NjAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Women report more side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine than men. Health experts explain why.,"Reports of COVID-19 vaccine side effects support what many have anecdotally observed: Women shoulder the bigger burden.

Among nearly 7000 reports processed through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System from Dec. 14 to Jan. 13 more than 79% of them came from women. The most frequently reported side effects were headache fatigue and dizziness.

Women also are more likely than men to experience some of the vaccine’s more unusual side effects such as an itchy red rash that appears at the injection site commonly known as COVID arm or Moderna arm because about 95% of the reactions occur with the Moderna vaccine. Overall women account for 77% of the Moderna vaccine’s reported side effects.

These side effects – even if unusual – are a good sign the vaccine is working to arm the body’s immune system against the coronavirus. But why are women more likely to experience them than men?

Health experts say it may be the result of biological differences inconsistent reporting by men and gender bias in clinical trials.

Biological differences

Women exhibit a greater immune response to vaccines than men experts say which may partially explain why more of them have reported side effects to the COVID-19 vaccine.

“From a biological perspective women and girls produce sometimes twice as many infection-fighting antibodies from vaccines” said Rosemary Morgan a research scientist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Although there’s no data comparing men and women's immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine researchers from a 2019 study found women developed greater cytokine and antibody responses compared with men after getting the flu vaccine.

That could be because women have a higher frequency of CD4+ T cells also called ""T helper cells"" which activate other cells from the immune system that make antibodies to combat the virus said Dr. Daniel Saban an immunologist scientist at Duke University School of Medicine.

“It’s the adaptive immune response that is acting in a more robust fashion with the vaccine” he said. “(These cells) are more poised to be active and trigger this response.”

Hormones also could influence the immune responses for men and women Saban said because some immune cells have estrogen receptors on them. Women produce more estrogen than men which may affect how the immune cells work.

Possible inconsistent reporting

Women may be experiencing vaccine side effects more than men but men may also be reporting them less frequently health experts say.

“We don’t have more robust evidence that look at reporting side effects … but what we do know is that it is possible that women may be reporting more side effects than men due to what we know about how men behave in relation to health care” Morgan said.

Studies have shown women are more likely than men to use health care services according to the World Health Organization. That could help explain why men may be underreporting COVID-19 vaccine side effects.

Gender bias in clinical trials

Clinical research has historically neglected sex differences Morgan said which has affected how women respond to approved vaccines and medications.

Women were mostly excluded from clinical trials until the 1993 National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act was passed to ensure the inclusion of minorities in clinical research.

“In terms of medications and drugs many of the medications we have on the market today was approved based on clinical research that excluded women” Morgan said. “What was happening and still happens to this day in some cases is the male body was used as the standard and it was a very specific type of body certain age weight and white.”

Even though women were included in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials health experts say gender bias still exists today. Whereas dosing for pediatric patients is usually determined by weight an adult man and woman receive the same dose of vaccine regardless of size.

That means women may be getting a stronger dose than is necessary to trigger an adequate immune response. Studies show that may be true for flu vaccines. One 2008 study found women had a similar immune response to half a dose of flu vaccine as men who received a full dose.

A full dose is still safe and effective for women Morgan said but more side effects from a stronger reaction may contribute to vaccine hesitancy.

“If men and women are getting the same dosage it’s not unsafe in the sense that it’s still working and effective” she said. “If women are getting a stronger dose than they need to have the same effect and its causing greater vaccine hesitancy … to me that’s important for us to address.”

New research from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that people who receive Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine might experience more side effects than those who get Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine.

The agency’s findings come from a study published in the online journal JAMA.

Researchers gathered data from December 2020 to February 2021 from CDC’s V-Safe surveillance system which monitors and reports adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines through self-reporting surveys.

The data revealed that 75% of Moderna recipients reported side effects after getting one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine compared to 65% of the Pfizer/BioNTech recipients. Side effects included pain at the injection site fatigue and headaches.

Researchers noted that the study participants represented less than 10% of the total number of people who received their first vaccine at the time of the study.

CDC officials have said that mild side effects are expected with getting the COVID-19 vaccine and that the side effects are a normal sign that your body is building protection.

In addition to a sore arm people can experience a fever and some flu-like symptoms such as fatigue aches chills or headache. They last about a day according to CDC officials. The reactions are a sign that the immune system is revving up.

The vaccines are routinely monitored for their safety.

RELATED: Vaccination site closes after adverse reactions to Johnson & Johnson vaccine: report

Concerns began to mount this week about side effects from the Johnson & Johonson vaccine which was not included in the study.

Georgia health officials temporarily stopped vaccinations of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at one site in north Georgia after eight people experienced ""adverse reactions"" on Wednesday. At least three other states — North Carolina Iowa and Colorado — have reported adverse reactions of people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at some locations. One of the eight people at the vaccination site in Cumming Georgia was evaluated at a hospital and released the Georgia Department of Public Health said Friday. The others were monitored and sent home.

There’s no reason to believe there is anything wrong with the vaccine and people who have received it should not be concerned said Dr. Kathleen Toomey Georgia’s health commissioner.

According to the CDC more than 68 million Americans are fully vaccinated representing 20.5% of the total U.S. population.

This story was reported from Los Angeles.

His bet on the 5 per cent now looks a smart one. Last week Moderna delivered the first of 17 million coronavirus vaccine doses to the UK. Patients in Scotland and Wales were the first to be jabbed after the supplies arrived from Brussels. The delivery of hundreds of thousands of jabs was seen as key to countering a slowdown in the UK’s vaccination programme due to shortages"

Dear Nutritionist

I’m a young reader of your column. I wanted to know if you have any knowledge of energy drinks and the long term effect of using them. I started about two years ago when I didn’t get enough sleep and had an exam and now I need them at least a couple times a week and overall I need more caffeine to get going in the morning. I sometimes used to take them for energy when going out because I don’t want to drink. Is there any data that these are damaging to my health?

Thank you!

Simone

Dear Simone

Thanks for reading and writing in! This is a super question as the global energy drink market is expected to reach $72 billion by 2024. And it’s largely unregulated. In fact consumer investigation has shown the companies in question don’t always accurately disclose caffeine levels. This is while beverages are getting larger and larger! They can contain up to 500mg of caffeine per can or bottle compared with 100mg in a typical cup of coffee or 50mg in a normal can of soda. They can also contain a lot of sugar - 18-63g depending on the brand. For a great list of popular beverages and their sugar content go here. Note that many energy drinks are now using artificial sweeteners to be more attractive to young people but the adverse health impact of artificial sweeteners is well documented. Those concerned about their health are best to avoid it if they can.

You may not be surprised to find out that energy drinks are targeted at young consumers (teens to 35). But even children are consuming them now!

So what’s the harm?

Almost everyone likes a good caffeine buzz - and who doesn’t like extra energy? So what’s the harm really? Well a growing body of science reports that energy drinks can have serious detrimental health impacts.

Some studies suggest caffeine is actually dehydrating to the body. We know caffeine is a diuretic which makes us lose water. This can be especially dangerous when mixed with alcohol which is also seriously dehydrating or when taken by those who are already losing a lot of water via sweat - like athletes.

We also know caffeine impacts sleep and can cause wakefulness so it’s no surprise that sleep disturbances are on the list of health impacts of energy drinks. What we may not realize is that even a slight reduction in sleep causes far more accidents and heart attacks as seen with daylight savings each year. Losing just an hour of sleep causes a huge spike in heart attacks car accidents industrial accidents suicides and more.

We also know caffeine is a stimulant. While it can pick us up it can also cause an increase in stress hormones we don’t need more of. One study published in JAMA found that after consuming a 16 oz energy drink the participants had a 74% in norepinephrine. This is more commonly known as the fight or flight hormone. This hormone can be associated with feelings of strength and elation but also with panic and anxiety attacks elevated blood pressure and hyperactivity. In sensitive people it can cause extreme mania grandiosity and even psychosis. In fact CAMH has banned energy drinks on their in-patient units because of the associated difficulty managing patients after they have consumed it. The cocktail of excessive caffeine and sugar often exacerbates mental health symptoms severely.

The increase in norepinephrine also explains the habit forming behaviour around energy drinks: after norepinephrine comes an energy and mood crash that can bring on extreme fatigue and depression. So it would seem to the now exceedingly sleepy or sad brain that the best fix would be a little pick me up. You can see how it would be easy to develop a habit where these drinks are concerned.

They keep you awake and can make you moody so what?

Well that’s not all. Energy drink emergency room visits are not uncommon. In fact between 2007 and 2011 they were noted to double. And there are no signs of that trend stopping as these drinks become more popular.

There were also 5126 poisonings related to energy drinks reported to U.S. poison control centres between 2010 and 2013. Most concerning: greater than 40% of these were involving children. Clearly the impact of these drinks may be amplified in younger persons. We can finger point at parents here but nobody has 100% control of their kids 100% of the time. And if they are government approved people assume they are safe.

In Canada they are approved by our food and drug agency as a food and as such they are regulated. Health Canada has:

Established minimum and maximum limits for caffeine content from all sources;

Set limits on other ingredients such as vitamins and minerals and develop a list of accepted and unaccepted ingredients;

Prohibited the use of Energy Drinks as an ingredient in pre-mixed alcoholic beverages;

Required statements on the label indicating that the product is ""not recommended for children pregnant/breastfeeding women individuals sensitive to caffeine"" and ""do not mix with alcohol"";

Required a statement on the label identifying the product as being a ""High source of caffeine"";

Required the labelling of the amount of caffeine from all sources be shown in mg per container or per serving size;

Required that all general food labelling provisions apply (e.g. nutrition facts table ingredient labelling allergen labelling etc).

In the United States energy drinks aren’t yet FDA approved or regulated because of controversy about which category they fall under although there is pressure from doctors researchers and public health experts for tighter regulation.

So they’re regulated see they’re safe!

I wish it were that simple. As well as stimulating mood caffeine drinks stimulate the heart. Studies show they have an almost immediate impact on blood pressure and heart rhythm and can quickly cause heart palpitations. It’s advised that anyone with high blood pressure or heart rhythm disorders use extreme caution when using energy drinks. In addition there are a number of reports of cardiac arrest in young people after having consumed energy drinks with several large lawsuits filed claiming harm and death and others over labelling and misrepresentation.

Deaths linked to energy drinks

There have been a number of deaths linked to the consumption of energy drinks:

The autopsy in the case of a 14 year old girl revealed that the girl died from cardiac arrhythmia from caffeine toxicity. The same was determined to have happened to another 16 year old boy and neither were known to have pre existing heart conditions. This is not even going into what happens when energy drinks are mixed with drugs or alcohol which is common in the younger crowd and is known to amplify the risks.

The takeaway here is that just because it’s freely available it may not be a good idea to reach for energy drinks for energy. There is evidence they can be habit forming and can have a huge list of associated health risks. I recommend a healthy diet and exercise with good sleep patterns and regular sun exposure for energy. This will serve you far better in the long run.

I’m always impressed when young people are interested in taking care of their health better. So thank you Simone for reading and for writing in Simone! I would love to hear from other young people. Later this year I have a plan in the works to roll out a peer-led diet program for youth who struggle with healthy weight. This will be a community based whole foods let’s get excited about cooking sort of program. If that’s something you would be interested in participating in please reach out to get your name on the list and learn more.

As always if readers have their own health questions I welcome them. Just send me an email at [email protected]. Readers can sign up for my free newsletter at hopenotdope.ca to stay abreast of health news and upcoming events. Thanks for reading!

Simply sign up to the US financial regulation myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

Rules written in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis to limit the potential for a blow-up like Archegos Capital have still not been fully implemented throwing a spotlight on regulators in a fiasco that has shocked Wall Street and raised questions on Capitol Hill.

Crucial parts of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act an 848-page law that was meant to shore up big banks and temper excessive risk taking in the derivatives market have been delayed again and again.

Critics are now arguing that had regulators implemented the rules faster the implosion of Bill Hwang’s family office and the multibillion-dollar losses it caused two banks could have been limited.

In particular rules that would have governed the disclosure of Archegos’s derivatives trades are still not in force and neither are requirements for players like Hwang to post initial margin payments meant to cover potential trading losses. Hwang was able to place more than $50bn of bets on the share prices of a handful of US and Chinese companies and could not pay his counterparties when they started going against him.

Diane Jaffee a portfolio manager at asset manager TCW said that regulators had implemented Dodd-Frank at an “anaemic” pace. The ability of an unknown family office like Archegos to run up such outsize risks “is like the last hurrah . . . before regulations come in” she said.

What we try to do is make sure that the banks understand the risks that they're running and have systems in place to manage them. This would appear to be . . . a failure on that front

Equity total return swaps like those used by Archegos are overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission which has been far slower to write its rules than the Commodity Futures Trading Commission the main derivatives regulator.

SEC rules are due to finally come into force on November 1. Had they already done so the SEC would have had access to data on Archegos’s trades including the size of each transaction and who the family office had traded with — rules already established in other parts of the derivatives market regulated by the CFTC.

“It is a dereliction of duty by the SEC not to have a properly regulated swaps market 13 years after they were at the core of causing and spreading the 2008 crash” said Dennis Kelleher president of the advocacy group Better Markets.

The opacity of Archegos’s positions has proven central to the incident given many of its trading counterparties did not know it had taken similar positions with other banks across Wall Street. It was only when Hwang called Archegos’ many counterparties together for a meeting in late March that it became clear to each bank how large and concentrated the Archegos positions were people familiar with the meeting have said.

“The SEC is 10 years late on implementing rules that would have provided more transparency into what was happening” said an executive focused on government regulation at a large hedge fund. “The SEC completely dropped the ball.”

The SEC declined to comment.

Margin requirements were delayed

The SEC has also not implemented rules on margin requirements for derivatives trades conducted away from exchanges and clearing houses which would affect the broker dealers it regulates.

Broad global rules demanding that asset managers set aside more cash to cover their swaps deals are defined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and International Organization of Securities Commissions (Iosco) the umbrella group for global markets watchdogs. Local regulators are given some leeway to adapt the rules to their markets.

In the US that job is split among a host of regulators. Federal banking regulators have already introduced margin requirements for large banks trading with each other. However as Covid-19 struck last year global regulators agreed to push back the implementation of the rules that covered smaller financial firms trading derivatives from September 2020 to September 2022.

That decision meant a group like Archegos — which held derivatives positions worth more than $50bn according to people familiar with the trades — was not required by any US regulators to post margin when it first initiated a trade.

Had the delay not been agreed Archegos would have likely tripped above the designated size threshold last September requiring it to post margin by Basel and Iosco standards after the value of its notional derivatives exposure eclipsed $8bn. The rules would require enough cash to cover 10 days of possible losses based on the historic performance of the shares.

“The rules were designed to deal with these risks but they were designed on a schedule that ends up being too late to catch this counterparty” said a derivatives lawyer at a large international law firm.

Wider markets were insulated

Multiple derivatives lawyers noted that post-financial crisis capital rules had helped insulate wider markets with some of the banks involved absorbing sizeable losses without the need for state intervention.

Credit Suisse suffered a $4.7bn loss while Nomura has warned it could lose $2bn. Others including Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo collectively sold more than $20bn worth of stock they held as hedges for their trades with Archegos to limit their own losses. So far nine banks have found themselves involved in the tumult including Deutsche Bank UBS Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Mizuho.

The banks’ prime brokerage units that enabled Archegos’s supercharged trades have not disclosed how much margin they required when the fund first initiated its transactions. Lawyers who work with banks said they have not typically implemented regulatory minimums before they come into force because of competitive pressures.

Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell signalled concern telling the CBS news programme 60 Minutes on Sunday that he was concerned trades with a single customer could result in such substantial losses to these large firms.

“What we try to do is make sure that the banks understand the risks that they're running and have systems in place to manage them” he said. “This would appear to be a significant shortfall — a failure on that front.”

Credit Suisse Deutsche Bank Goldman MUFG Mizuho Morgan Stanley Nomura UBS and Wells Fargo declined to comment as did Archegos.

The company currently deploys its infrastructure across 233 commercial residential and retail sites across the country with a tenanted area of 276 million square feet. Cipher-Plexus Capital Advisor was exclusive advisor for the transaction.

""Connectivity is fundamental to large developing digital economies like India and our mission is to build an end-to-end intelligent scalable and convergent connectivity ecosystem"" said Ram Sellaratnam Sunil Menon and Subash Vasudevan Co-Founders of iBus. ""Distributed antenna systems such as in-building solutions have been fragmented and silo-ed for a long time. With this investment iBus will build scale and eliminate inefficiencies to fast track the essential digitalisation of our economy.""

The company's business model is intricately linked to India's data consumption and digital infrastructure story. The country's per capita data consumption is the highest globally with an average monthly data consumption of 11 GB per month compared to only 1 GB per month as recently as March 2017. About 80 per cent of data consumption takes place indoors where telecom coverage is least adequate and the growth in mobile data consumption and the transition to 4G / 5G requires densification of indoor telecom networks.

With the government's focus on enhancing digital infrastructure across the country businesses such as iBus will play a critical role in building such infrastructure and further improving network capacity and coverage. The company also provides other solutions such as O-RAN deployment and data analytics which will play an increasingly important role as the country moves towards 5G.

""We are excited to partner with a management team that is establishing itself as the in-building solutions partner of choice for telecom operators"" said Raja Parthasarathy Managing Director and Co-Head of Morgan Stanley India Infrastructure. ""Our investment will allow iBus to drive consolidation and scale in a fragmented industry while enhancing the mobile user experience"" he said.

Founded in 2013 by three first-generation entrepreneurs iBus previously raised capital from a number of well-known investors and family offices.

Before Young there was Fairlawn

In this week’s column I will be delving into the history of Fairlawn the building that most campus community members refer to today as Young. Built between 1852 and 1853 for Boston lawyer Andrew Ritchie Fairlawn is one of the earlier Bellevue cottages to have been erected. The original wood-frame and brick Queen Anne Elizabethan Revival style residence was designed by Seth Bradford and later additions from architects Richard Morris Hunt McKim Mead & White and Peabody & Stearns were added.

In 1869 Levi P. Morton who later served as Vice President to President Benjamin Harrison bought the property from Ritchie. Morton enjoyed the home for several years without making any major changes to the original structure. This was the case until the 1870s when Morton commissioned Richard Morris Hunt to construct a mirrored ballroom in preparation of hosting President Ulysses S. Grant at Fairlawn. Expecting such an esteemed guest it was imperative that an appropriate room be added to the home for the festivities to be held in. Additionally pun intended family room additions designed by McKim Mead and White were built on the second floor over the ballroom in 1881. During this construction they also added the elegant Tiffany and Co. stained glass windows above the staircase in the great hall entrance. Today the upstairs second floor is mainly used for The Pell Center and university offices.

In 1900 Morton sold Fairlawn to New York political player and iron tycoon Isaiah Townsend Burden. Burden grew his wealth after he inherited his father’s company Burden Iron Works. His economic influence opened the door for him to become one of the organizers of the Knickerbocker Trust Co. and serve as president of Bailey’s Beach here in Newport. While Burden owned the estate architects Peabody & Stearns added the final significant change to the exterior of Fairlawn with the construction of the curved porch located at the east end of the home. After Burdens death the property was passed own to his children and remained a private residence until the 1920s.

Later Fairlawn was used as a preparatory and junior college eventually returning to residential use in the 1960s. In 1997 Salve Regina University acquired the property to house The Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy. The Pell Center is named for Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island and Fairlawn was eventually renamed to honor university benefactors Anita O’Keefe and Robert R. Young. In 1999 the Newport Historical Society awarded the Salve Regina with a historic preservation award for the Young building’s restoration and preservation. Today Young continues to house the Pell Center while also serving as student housing and hosts academic classes. Young is distinctive not only to students for the lengthy walk across campus required to reach it but also for the continual fostering of education civic engagement and preservation it embraces within its walls.

Learning inside a distinguished home such as Young is very unique which lead me to also assume that teaching in such a place is also quite exceptional. I spoke with Dr. Timothy Neary chairman and professor in the history department to gain some perspective about what it is like teaching history in such a historically significant building. Dr. Neary remarked “we are lucky to be in Newport one of great historically preserved cities in the United States. I often compare teaching history on Salve’s campus to being a kid in a candy store. It’s an embarrassment of riches.”

I currently take Introduction to Public History with Dr. Neary and the course focuses on civic engagement one of the many things the Pell Center places an emphasis on. I personally sense that this historic environment has impacted my learning and Dr. Neary shared with me that it has also influenced his teaching saying “my teaching has certainly been influenced by Salve’s campus. The historic campus buildings as well as nearby Preservation Society properties like the Breakers and Marble House—along with important historical sites throughout Newport representing nearly 400 years of history in the post-European contact period—all provide wonderful tools for teaching. Whether pointing out the Gilded Age interior of classrooms in Antone Gerety McAuley or Young or taking classes on fieldtrips to the Colony House Touro Synagogue or Great Friends Meeting House to name just a few examples I am able to show students brick and mortar evidence of how people lived what they valued and how they interacted with others during various periods in history.”

It is important to acknowledge that although it is great to emphasize the positives of this environment there can be negatives as well. An example of the negative being individuals becoming jaded towards the mansions and history surrounding them. Dr. Neary touched on this remarking “Like the kid in the candy shop too much of good thing can be problematic. It’s easy to take for granted our stunning campus. That’s why I am energized by visitors and the arrival of first-year students each year. Their enthusiasm allows me to see the campus with new eyes. I would add that the rarefied setting of Salve’s campus can at times wrap one in a cocoon of beauty and privilege which could lead to disengaging with issues like poverty injustice and inequality.”

He continued “Our Mercy mission and student research internships practicums and clinical experiences throughout Newport Aquidneck Island and beyond however provide students with opportunities not only to learn about but also experience the real world. In the case of Salve’s campus history that means not only studying the wealthy industrialist who bankrolled the estate and the prominent architect who designed its mansion but also learning about the thousands of workers whose toil and sweat built the financial empires of the Gilded Age along with the women and men who staffed Newport’s elaborate “summer cottages” grounds and stables.”

It is important for us all every now and then to take a step back and look at our surroundings with new eyes. Whether this translates to walking a different route to class choosing a new spot on campus to study or taking a class focused on the history of Newport these are all things that can further nourish our respect and admiration for these great buildings. I would also like to extend a special thank you to Dr. Neary for taking the time to answer my questions- I could not agree more with what he had to say.

When bitcoin was first introduced it had little to no value. Early adopters traded thousands of bitcoin for just a few dollars until the infamous “Pizza Day” incident when Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10000 BTC for two large pizzas setting in motion a chain of events that lead to bitcoin’s value growing from a few cents to nearly $60000 in just over a decade.

Bitcoin has come a long way since then with large corporate institutions spending years denying its value as an investable asset only to turn around and start investing in it themselves. Recently PayPal introduced bitcoin as a payment method with millions of merchants that use its platform celebrities like Paris Hilton joined the community and it seems that bitcoin is poised for even more growth.

By analyzing bitcoin’s past performance it’s not impossible to get an idea of where its value is set to go next. Although many analysts and influencers alike have made bold predictions — like bitcoin growing to as much as $1 million — I thought it would be best to take a look for ourselves by analyzing each halving epoch that is bitcoin’s performance between each halving event.

The chart below explores bitcoin’s value over the last 11 years in four separate sections called the halving epochs:

The chart was inspired by a similar one I recently came across which lacked any projections that I felt necessary to predict where bitcoin is heading next. As mentioned on the chart each epoch is 20 times larger than the previous one and covers the times between each halving event. When analyzing and comparing each epoch a clear trend emerges.

Epoch 1: Genesis Block (2009-01-03) to First Halving (2012-11-28)

In the first epoch bitcoin found its footing after first being released by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. It took several months to see early adopters come on board and a dollar-based value be established with Laszlo Hanyecz’s 10000 BTC pizzas cementing its price. During this time bitcoin saw its value rise from $000 to as high as $29.02 with early use limited to trading over forums and early limited exchanges.

Epoch 2: First Halving (2012-11-28) to Second Halving (2016-07-09)

In the second epoch bitcoin started to see further adoption. Although the infamous Mt. Gox exchange was founded in 2010 already and had seen some controversy in 2011 with several hacks by 2013 and early 2014 it was handling as much as 70 percent of all bitcoin transactions before the infamous hack that saw it shut down and bitcoin seeing a large drop in value as thousands of bitcoins were stolen. Then there was the infamous Silk Road and Silk Road 2.0 platforms which led the media to associate bitcoin with illegal activities. During the second epoch bitcoin’s value traded for as low as $12.33 to a high of $1134.93.

Epoch 3: Third Halving (2016-07-09) to Fourth Halving (2020-05-11)

By the third epoch bitcoin had seen its adoption grow to new highs. The world’s largest investors and institutions were finally taking notice with many changing their opinions on bitcoin as a decent asset and good store of value. Bitcoin’s run from a low of $526.98 to its famous peak of $19640.51 in late 2017 was widely reported as was the subsequent plunge in value. Although it became clear that bitcoin trading was volatile asset managers and the average Joe alike took notice of bitcoin as an asset.

Epoch 4: Fourth Halving (2020-05-11) to Fifth Halving (Second Half of 2024)

We currently find ourselves in the fourth epoch. Public companies such as MicroStrategy and Tesla have added bitcoin to their balance sheets new highs are being reached almost monthly and reputable investors suggest it could go as high as $1 million sometime in the near future. If bitcoin follows the same trajectory as the last epoch I predict that it may very well reach a high of over $400000 before once again seeing an almost sudden plunge in value as investors try to reap as high a profit as possible. If bitcoin does indeed follow this trajectory I believe we may see a massive new high before the end of 2021.

The Pattern and What the Future Holds

It is evident that each time a halving occurs in due time bitcoin sees a dramatic surge to a new all-time high beyond many expectations. As soon as this peak arrives many start to sell their investments to reap the profits with bitcoin then seeing a plunge as dramatic as the surge that came before it. Bitcoin’s value sees regular pumps followed by regular dumps until it eventually stabilizes with a new bottom. For some months it trades relatively sideways until a second surge begins. It isn’t however as dramatic as the one before but it does push bitcoin’s value high enough to see it reach at least half its previous all-time high before the next halving.

It is likely many of the large institutions and investors that have bought millions worth of bitcoin over the last few years will sell off their holdings once bitcoin reaches a high enough value. The same can be said about miners who have started accumulating their newly mined coins instead of selling them. In this case bitcoin should peak somewhere between $350000 and $450000 if we follow the same trend during this epoch as the last. It could take months maybe even a year before bitcoin sees this new high but I believe we’re heading there sometime later this year.

One concern that is quite evident is that more and more publicly traded companies are adding bitcoin to their balance sheet. This is great in terms of adoption and legitimizing bitcoin as an asset. However these companies have shareholders and it is very likely that a company like MicroStrategy that holds billions of dollars worth of bitcoin will see an activist shareholder or two jump on board and push it to sell off its holdings should it reach a massive new high as predicted above.

Let’s continue to look at MicroStrategy as an example. They hold over 90000 bitcoin currently worth north of $5 billion with the company’s market cap being just over $6.75 billion. Should bitcoin reach a high of $400000 it would value their bitcoin holdings over $36 billion and with BlackRock Morgan Stanley and Vanguard owning over 30 percent of the company’s shares they are likely to push them to sell as soon as possible and return value to shareholders. That’s over 90000 bitcoin that could flood the market the same could happen at many other public companies and threatens not just bitcoin’s price but trust in it as a storage of value.

What remains clear looking at the chart above is that bitcoin has proved time and time again that it is a trustworthy asset and store of value. It sees surges and plunges and it is likely to happen for several years to come. Bitcoin is by no means near its peak and even though it may take a few years bitcoin is poised for tremendous growth and will continue to see large-scale adoption as it becomes clearer to the global audience.

Jessica Alba's consumer goods startup Honest Company is going public.

The company filed for an IPO on Friday with plans to sell shares on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""HNST."" It listed a placeholder IPO value of $100 million.

Diapers and wipes accounted for 63% of the company's $300.5 million in revenue last year. Skin personal care household and wellness items made up the rest of its sales.

While the company's 2020 revenue grew about 28% from the previous year it reported a net loss of $14.5 million. It has never been profitable on an annual basis since its founding in 2012.

""We have incurred net losses each year since our inception and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future"" the company wrote in the risk factors section of its S-1.

Honest Company's 2020 growth was driven in part by a bump in digital sales which represented 55% of its revenue last year. Digitally-native brands like Honest which sells products on Honest.com and digital retailers like Amazon benefited from a overall shift to ecommerce last year as brick-and-mortar stores shut down during the coronavirus pandemic. US e-commerce sales rose 32.4% in 2020 to $791.7 billion according to the US Census Bureau.

""We see consumers increasingly self-educating on the benefits of clean and natural products through social media influencers and other online content driving digital engagement and purchasing that supports continued outsized growth of the ecommerce channel"" the company wrote in its prospectus.

Alba started Honest Company with a mission to make consumer products that the actress deemed ""clean"" excluding chemicals and materials like parabens and sulfates. The brand's approach to labeling its products has led to trouble in the past. In 2017 the company settled a lawsuit that claimed it fraudulently labeled some of its products as ""natural"" ""plant-based"" or ""no harsh chemicals (ever!).""

""It was the most challenging time of my career"" said Lolmaugh who joined the Plymouth-based chain of tile and flooring stores as a warehouse worker in 2001 and became chief executive in 2019. ""We had to furlough or lay off hundreds of people. It was the worst.""

But as 2020 unfolded Americans stuck at home began remodeling or looking for new houses — and they went shopping for home-improvement products. The Tile Shop as its stores are called benefited significantly: Full-year results released last month showed a solid profit and a complete wipeout of debt.

""Did it feel funny? Absolutely"" Lolmaugh said. ""If I had gone to the board of directors last year and said 'I'm going to lower hours cut out Sundays cut 600 heads limit trucks and cut marketing. What do you guys think?' I would have been out the door! But when COVID forces you to do those things and your company turns around people go 'huh.' ""

The journey of Tile Shop Holdings stands out amid other ""pandemic prosperity"" cases however because of a secondary drama that played out among the company's shareholders.

Two outside directors who are wealthy investors Peter Kamin and Peter Jacullo in late 2019 steered the company into a controversial delisting of its stock from the Nasdaq main board to the over-the-counter market. The move wiped out two-thirds of Tile Shop's market value and the two directors went on a buying spree that gave them control of the 35-year-old firm. Other shareholders quickly sued.

A short time later the two directors clashed with company founder and board Chairman Robert Rucker leading to his ouster and bitter public exchange in February 2020.

The next month the nation shut down as the pandemic hit. Tile Shop which has 143 stores that generate $325 million in annual sales shuttered many immediately. It reopened under reduced hours on a state-by-state basis as governors deemed firms tied to construction to be essential services.

In the middle of it all was Lolmaugh 42 a former Marine who spent most of his career as a store manager and still enjoys getting out on the floor of the Plymouth store to talk with contractors and customers. Selected by Rucker as only the third leader of the company Lolmaugh has kept it in the middle of the tile marketplace: below the high-priced mom-and-pop specialists that have a direct line to artisan tilemakers in Europe and above the big-box chains that have low prices and narrower selection.

He also aimed to derive about 60% of Tile Shop's revenue from professionals either contractors installers or designers. The firm provides incentives to attract them. ""Their lifetime value is exponentially larger than a typical retail customer"" Lolmaugh said.

His first day as CEO in January 2019 coincided with the launch of a new enterprise resource system that turned into disaster. Complications in the technology transition wreaked havoc on point-of-sale terminals inventory management distribution and financial reporting.

The problems took months to iron out and contributed to a 5% drop in 2019 sales and a massive jump in expenses which hit 74% of revenue that year. Tile Shop's share price lost more than half its value during that time dropping below the $5 level that many institutional investors consider a minimum threshold.

After lingering below that level for several months Kamin and Jacullo prodded Rucker and other directors to delist. Such a move reduces expenses and disclosure requirements often giving management and directors more breathing room to reset a company.

But delisting also triggers a sell-off because mutual funds and other institutional portfolios have rules against owning shares in firms that are traded over the counter. Tile Shop shares dropped from $3.35 to $1.13 as major shareholders exited on the October 2019 day the delisting was announced.

Over the next two weeks Kamin a Florida investor with a history of reviving delisted companies and Jacullo a longtime adviser to a Hong Kong billionaire family that was an early investor in Tile Shop bought shares at prices that never exceeded $1.80 a share. In that brief period their combined stake rose to around 30% from 17%.

Other shareholders filed a class-action suit and a judge forced the directors to stop purchasing shares in mid-November. Last summer the suit was settled with a $12 million payout to Tile Shop shareholders (paid by the company's insurer) who lost money in the move. Kamin and Jacullo agreed to a standstill until mid-June 2023.

The two directors declined to comment through the company. A call to Rucker was not returned.

As pre-delisting shareholders in Tile Shop tried to recover lost value in court other investors began looking at the company because of the maneuver. One of them was Sean Kirkwood who runs a Philadelphia hedge fund called SRK Capital and studies delisted companies in search of trapped value. After the coronavirus hit Tile Shop shares traded below $1 for several weeks last March and April.

""It was basically being priced for bankruptcy when that really wasn't likely if you dug through the numbers"" Kirkwood said. His analysis led him to believe Tile Shop had plenty of liquidity for at least a year even if sales plunged 40%. He bought thousands of shares at prices averaging 81 cents.

Wes Cummins an investor in Dallas took notice of Tile Shop after the settlement of the class-action suit. Cummins started his hedge fund 272 Capital in February 2020 just before the market collapse. By summer he had attracted capital and Tile Shop had been through the most difficult period of the pandemic. Most of its stores were open at least for weekday hours that catered to contractors and installers.

""The company traded at a significant discount to everyone else in the group"" Cummins said referring to home-improvement retailers.

The pandemic forced executives and managers to look at costs and operations in new ways Lolmaugh said. Stores are being run with fewer employees and deliveries are taking longer in some cases. The company's head count dropped to around 1150 from 1600 and expenses dropped to 65% of sales. Customers he said have been more understanding than he can ever recall.

""Ultimately our goal is to enhance service. But we don't want to go back to where we were before"" he said. ""Since we were able to flip the expense structure upside down it's really benefited the Tile Shop.""

The remodeling trend helped. Tile Shop finished 2020 with a 4.5% drop in revenue but it saw a 4% gain in the last quarter. By October the company wiped out $63 million in debt and it ended the year with cash on hand. Tile Shop's stock ended 2020 at $4.30 and is now trading around $7.

""They did an exceptional job way better than my best-case analysis"" said Kirkwood who continues to own shares and told his clients Tile Shop turned out to be a ""huge winner.""

Cummins wrote a letter to Tile Shop executives and directors last fall urging them to consider moving back on to the Nasdaq main board or ""uplisting."" The return of institutional investors should give another jolt upward to its share price.

Not seeing any action from Tile Shop he enlisted another activist investor to get involved and in February wrote a letter that threatened a proxy fight.

When the company announced its 2020 results last month it said directors had decided to apply to uplist. A return to the Nasdaq main board could happen within weeks.

Cummins has not withdrawn the proxy threat. But he said last week ""I'm much more pleased. I see a lot more opportunity for shareholders. It feels like they're going to treat the shareholders fairly. There's a lot of opportunity in the stock.""

One prospect is a sale to another company an outcome that the directors discussed in depositions in the class-action suit. ""I think this is an extremely valuable asset for someone to purchase"" Cummins said. ""Opportunistic buyers have probably knocked on the door already.""

Lolmaugh said Tile Shop will take small steps in 2021 with plans for only one new store one relocation and updates to others. ""We've stabilized"" he said ""and now we're investing to get to that next level where we can do what we want to be it grow be it not.""

Shortly after we posted about Moderna Inc.’s October 2020 pledge not to enforce its COVID-19-related patents during the pandemic the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency regulatory approval for two COVID-19 vaccines produced by Moderna and BioNTech (with Pfizer) making these groups the first to ever enter the commercial market with mRNA-based therapies. This little-known and never-before-approved mRNA technology has since been widely administered and represents a primary weapon being used to defeat the pandemic.

While this effort carries on market players are confident that COVID-19 is but one of many indications that the mRNA technology platform might be utilized for and that approval of the mRNA vaccines could open the door for the approval of other mRNA-based medicines creating a wide range of new markets.

mRNA Market Players

Moderna

Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ: MRNA) is headquartered in Cambridge MA and as of April 2021 has a market capitalization of over $53 billion.

Along with BioNTech/Pfizer Moderna was one of the first developers to enter the market in December 2020 with an mRNA product its COVID-19 vaccine mRNA-1273. Moderna’s mRNA product pipeline includes 26 drug candidates directed to an array of indications including therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases oncology rare disease autoimmune disease and cardiovascular disease.

According to Moderna’s website it has four mRNA candidates in Phase 2 clinical trials including a cytomegalovirus vaccine personalized cancer vaccine and myocardial ischemia therapy; eight mRNA candidates in Phase 1 clinical trials including for cancer and infectious diseases; and 14 mRNA candidates in preclinical phase for various oncology infectious disease and other indications.

Figure 1: Overview of certain attributes of Moderna as of April 2021

Moderna has indicated it has over 270 issued or allowed U.S. and foreign patents protecting mRNA-based technology with over 600 worldwide pending patent applications. The company has identified at least seven granted U.S. patents that it alleges protect its COVID-19 mRNA-1273 vaccine.

Moderna appears to have sub-licensed foundational mRNA patents from Cellscript LLC based on advancements made by Drs. Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) in the 2000s. The Karikó-Weissman team addressed adverse immune responses to injected synthetic mRNA by replacing the nucleosides uridine and cytidine in the mRNA with pseudouridine and 5-methylcytidineone. Cellscript itself has a sub-license from its affiliate mRNA RiboTherapeutics Inc. which holds an exclusive license from UPenn.

An exemplary patent resulting from this work is U.S. Patent No. 8278036 which has broad claims (e.g. Claim 1: A method for inducing a mammalian cell to produce a protein of interest comprising: contacting said mammalian cell with in vitro-synthesized modified RNA encoding a protein of interest wherein said in vitro-synthesized modified RNA comprises the modified nucleoside pseudouridine) and reportedly may be included in the non-exclusive sublicense granted to Moderna.

Moderna has also reportedly entered into a research collaboration with Harvard University and its website claims to have in-licensed Harvard patents.

With respect to invalidity proceedings Moderna has filed several inter partes reviews (IPRs) including against CureVac’s U.S. Patent No. 8383340 (IPR2017-02194 filed September 29 2017: all claims found unpatentable); Arbutus Biopharma Corporation’s (Arbutus) U.S. Patent No. 9404127 (IPR2018-00680 filed February 21 2018: all claims found unpatentable); Arbutus’ U.S. Patent No. 9364435 (IPR2018-00739 filed March 5 2018: claims 1-6 9 12 14 and 15 found unpatentable); and Arbutus’ U.S Patent No. 8058069 (IPR2019-00554 filed January 9 2019: no challenged claims found unpatentable).

Moderna has also filed oppositions in the European Patent Office (EPO) including against Arbutus’ EP2279254 (Opposition filed April 2018: amended claims corresponding to Auxiliary Request 1 accepted and revocation denied pending appeal by Moderna) and CureVac’s EP2101823 (Opposition filed August 2017: patent revoked pending appeal).

In August 2018 an anonymous third party sought ex parte reexamination for Moderna’s U.S. Patent No. 9872900 with claims directed to an RNA vaccine. Moderna was successful in the reexam (App No. 90/014167) and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued a reexamination certificate indicating “The patentability of claims 1-26 is confirmed.”

There is no record of Moderna being a party to a patent infringement lawsuit before the federal district courts and it has pledged not to enforce its “COVID-19 related patents against those making vaccines intended to combat the pandemic” during the pandemic.

Moderna has entered into several strategic agreements including with Vertex (September 2020 Moderna strategic research collaboration and licensing agreement for the discovery and development of LNPs and mRNAs for the delivery of gene-editing therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis); Merck (January 2015 Master Collaboration and License Agreement for the discovery and development of vaccines and passive immunity treatments against viral diseases using modified mRNA; N.B. in October 2020 Merck ceded back rights to the adult respiratory syncytial virus vaccine the pair had been co-developing); AstraZeneca (a series of strategic agreements relating to the discovery development and commercialization of certain mRNA therapeutic candidates including for a range of cancers); and Lonza Ltd. (May 2020 Global Long Term Agreement “10-year strategic collaboration” to enable larger scale manufacture of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine and future products).

Notably Dr. Karikó who has been mentioned as a potential recipient of the Nobel Prize for her groundbreaking work mentioned above is reportedly a Vice President with BioNTech.

BioNTech

BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX) is headquartered in Mainz Germany and as of April 2021 has a market capitalization of over $27 billion.

Through its collaboration with Pfizer BioNTech was one of the first developers to enter the market in December 2020 with an mRNA product its COVID-19 vaccine BNT162. According to BioNTech’s website its product pipeline includes approximately 15 mRNA candidates directed to oncology influenza COVID-19 HIV tuberculosis rare disease and other indications.

BioNTech’s website also indicates it has one mRNA drug candidate (BNT122) in Phase 2 clinical trials for metastatic melanoma and other solid tumors (in collaboration with Genentech) seven mRNA candidates in Phase 1 clinical trials for various cancers (itself and in separate collaborations with e.g. Genentech and Sanofi) seven mRNA candidates in preclinical phase for various oncology infectious disease and rare disease indications (itself and in separate collaborations with e.g. Pfizer and Genevant).

Figure 2: Overview of certain attributes of BioNTech as of April 2021

BioNTech has stated that its overall worldwide owned and in-licensed patent portfolio includes more than 200 patent families at least 100 of which are solely or jointly owned by BioNTech. The company has described its mRNA patent portfolio as including patents and applications directed to mRNA structures (e.g. for increased immunogenicity) mRNA formulations (e.g. lipolex formulations lipid nanoparticles) mRNA manufacturing (e.g. mRNA purification and production) and mRNA product candidates (directed to various indications including oncology infectious disease rare disease).

Like Moderna BioNTech has reportedly in-licensed foundational mRNA patents based on advancements made by Drs. Karikó and Weissman. An exemplary patent resulting from this work is U.S. Patent No. 8278036 which has broad claims and may be included in the non-exclusive sublicense Cellscript granted to BioNTech.

With respect to invalidity proceedings BioNTech has filed EPO oppositions against Moderna’s EP3492109 (Opposition filed December 2020: proceedings pending); CureVac’s EP3292873 (Opposition filed January 2020: proceedings pending); CureVac’s EP3319622 (Opposition filed November 2020: proceedings pending); CureVac’s EP3173092 (Opposition filed March 2020: proceedings pending); CureVac’s EP3153179 (Opposition filed March 2020: proceedings pending); and CureVac’s EP3116535 (Opposition filed May 2020: proceedings pending). There is no record of BioNTech filing an IPR before the USPTO to date.

Regarding litigation before the U.S. federal courts Allele Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals (Allele) reportedly sued Pfizer and BioNTech (in one suit) and Regeneron (in a separate suit) claiming that the COVID-19 vaccines BNT162 (by BioNTech/Pfizer) and REGN-COV2 (by Regeneron) were each developed using Allele’s “mNeonGreen fluorescent protein” covered under U.S. Patent No. 10221221 without the company’s permission. These cases are pending in the Southern District of California (BioNTech/Pfizer) and the Southern District of New York (Regeneron). Pfizer and BioNTech recently moved to dismiss the complaint against them.

BioNTech has reportedly entered into a number of collaborations including with Pfizer (July 2018 Research Collaboration License Agreement to develop mRNA-based immunotherapies and a March 2020 Collaboration Agreement to develop and manufacture COVID-19 mRNA vaccines); Genentech (September 2016 Collaboration Agreement relating to BioNTech’s iNeST platform in mRNA drug class) Sanofi (November 2015 Collaboration and License Agreement relating to BioNTech’s intratumoral therapy platform in its mRNA drug class) Bayer (May 2016 Agreement relating to mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics for animal health indications); Regeneron (July 2020 strategic collaboration relating to BioNTech’s BNT111 FixVac mRNA oncology product); The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (September 2019 collaboration to develop HIV and tuberculosis programs that includes an initial equity investment of $55 million) and Genevant Sciences GmbH (July 2018 License and Co-Development Agreement under which Genevant licenses Arbutus Biopharma Corporation LNP technology to BioNTech—more on this in Part II ).

CureVac

CureVac NV (NASDAQ: CVAC) is headquartered in Tübingen Germany and as of April 2021 has a market capitalization of over $17 billion.

According to its website CureVac’s pipeline includes four mRNA-based prophylactic vaccines four RNA-based cancer immunotherapies and four protein-based therapies (including for ocular and lung). As of the date of this article CureVac does not have any mRNA products on the market. However its mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate (in collaboration with Bayer) is reportedly in Phase 3 clinical trials.

Per CureVac’s website it has 3 candidates in Phase 1 clinical trials for rabies melanoma and lung cancer (in collaboration with Ludwig Cancer Center and Boehringer Ingelheim) and approximately 10 mRNA candidates in preclinical development or discovery for an array of indications in the areas of oncology infectious diseases and other indications (in collaboration with entities such as GSK Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) CRISPR Therapeutics Genmab Harvard Medical School and Yale University School of Medicine).

Figure 3: Overview of certain attributes of CureVac as of April 2021

CureVac has stated that it is a pioneer in the mRNA space and has built a U.S. and worldwide patent portfolio totaling approximately 700 issued patents including over 60 issued U.S. patents over 50 issued European patents and over 150 issued patents in other countries with hundreds of worldwide patent applications pending. CureVac has also indicated these patents include claims relating to its mRNA technology platform including its “RNAoptimizer technology platform CV8102 BI 1361849 (former CV9202) CV7202 CV-SSIV our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and our CVCM delivery system.” The company also claims that its patents and applications are “the most cited among mRNA companies’ intellectual property.”

With respect to invalidity proceedings CureVac has filed EPO oppositions against UPenn’s EP2528626 (Opposition filed June 2017: patent revoked). There is no record of CureVac filing an IPR before the USPTO. Defensively CureVac’s patents have been the subject of numerous attacks before the EPO including by BioNTech Moderna and eTheRNA as stated herein and in the forthcoming posts as well as others including: EP1797886 (April 9 2020 Opposition filed by Gerhard Weinzierl; April 14 2020 Opposition filed by Koenig Szynka Tilmann Von Renesse); EP2680881 (December 18 2017 Opposition filed by Strawman Ltd.); EP2680880 (December 18 2017 Opposition filed by Strawman Ltd.); EP3326641 (Four Oppositions filed in Finland on April 28 2020 by Dr. Martin Grund Rainer Friedrich Pfizer Inc. and Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.; Four Oppositions filed in EP by Dr. Martin Grund on March 26 2020 Rainer Friedrich on April 17 2020 Pfizer Inc. on March 26 2020 and Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. on March 24 2020). Europe does not require the actual opponent party in interest to be disclosed therefore any of the market players could be behind these oppositions while using “Strawman Ltd.” for example.

CureVac has reportedly partnered with third parties in connection with mRNA technology including Novartis (March 2021 initial agreement for manufacturing of CureVac’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate CVnCoV); Bayer (January 2021 collaboration and services agreement for the development and supply of CureVac’s CVnCoV candidate); GlaxoSmithKline (July 2020 Collaboration and License Agreement to research develop and commercialize CureVac’s prophylactic and therapeutic non-replicating mRNA-based vaccines targeting infectious diseases); Genmab (December 2019 Collaboration and License Agreement for the development of mRNA-based antibody therapeutics); CRISPR Therapeutics (November 2017 Development and License Agreement for developing CRISPR-based therapeutics in select disease areas and novel Cas9 mRNA constructs with improved properties for gene editing applications); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (February 2015 Global Access Commitments Agreement to develop prophylactic vaccines based on CureVac’s mRNA platform and $52+ million in funding from the foundation) and Boehringer Ingelheim (August 2014 Exclusive Collaboration and License Agreement to develop next generation lung cancer immunotherapy with CureVac’s CV9202).

With respect to LNP delivery technology CureVac has reportedly entered into agreements with Arcturus Therapeutics (January 2018 Development and Option Agreement that provides CureVac with access to Arcturus’s LNP formulation technology for use in CureVac’s mRNA technology); and Acuitas (April 2016 Development and Option Agreement that provides CureVac access to Acuitas’s LNP formulation technology that is used in combination with CureVac’s mRNA technology). More on these entities and LNP technology will be provided in Part II .

In Part II we will discuss Translate BIO Arcturus eTheRNA and certain issues relating to Arbutus’ LNP delivery technology.

But investing in clinical-stage biotech stocks can be extraordinarily risky. In this Motley Fool Live video recorded on March 31 2021 Motley Fool contributors Keith Speights and Brian Orelli discuss three critical things investors should look for before buying clinical-stage biotech stocks.

10 stocks we like better than CRISPR Therapeutics

When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.*

David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and CRISPR Therapeutics wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.

See the 10 stocks

*Stock Advisor returns as of February 24 2021

Keith Speights: There is some news from last week that you and I didn't get a chance to talk about. This is the kind of news that normally you would just overlook. But there was a small very small clinical-stage biotech Odonate Therapeutics (NASDAQ: ODT) -- the company announced that it was discontinuing development of its lead candidate after meeting with the FDA lead it to conclude the drug just wasn't going to win approval.

But what's really striking about this particular situation is that Odonate also said it's going to shut down the company altogether. And so in my view this served as a big reminder for investors about the risks of buying clinical-stage biotech stocks especially those with only one pipeline candidate like Odonate had.

Brian for investors who want to buy clinical-stage biotech stocks what are critical things they should look for to avoid this kind of situation where a company just totally goes out of business?

Brian Orelli: This is an aside I love this move -- I mean obviously not for Odonate shareholders that's obviously horrible for them -- but there's a lot of times the small biotech companies will try to milk whatever they can out of the data and trying to raise more money and that's not fair to shareholders. So shutting down trying to get as much of the capital out of the company as possible is ultimately the best news for the shareholders even though they obviously had this clinical issue with their remaining stock.

In terms of lessons I think the first is to invest in companies with multiple shots on goal. I am a big fan of Ionis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: IONS). It went down 20% earlier this last week or maybe the week before on an apparent phase III failure in Huntington's disease. But the company still has five phase III programs and something like 25 phase II programs. I'm a shareholder and the decline was certainly painful but I'm not worried about the company shutting down.

The other issue here is to make sure companies have enough capital to get them through to the next binary event or maybe even two binary events. Having a partner can certainly help with sharing the cost and the risks. An example there would be like CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP). They're partnered with Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX). They're partnered obviously on a CRISPR lead asset for beta-thalassemia and sickle cell. But they also have three other research stage programs that they are working on together.

Then finally just keep your investments to a small percentage of your portfolio. Don't let any one biotech especially one biotech with only one drug become a large percentage of your portfolio because this can certainly -- you're taking on a lot of risks that way.

NEM,Newmont,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA0LzExLzMtZ29sZC1zdG9ja3MtdG8tYnV5LXJpZ2h0LW5vdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Gold Stocks to Buy Right Now,"As more and more hours of golden sunlight are filling our days it seems like now's a great time for investors to add some luster to the portfolio.

After gold's historic run in 2020 -- one that saw its price surpass $2000 per ounce in August -- the price of gold has steadily declined since the start of 2021. In January the average price of the yellow metal was $1867 per ounce; however the average prices have since tumbled to $1808 and $1718 in February and March respectively.

While the declining price of gold may suggest to some investors that it would be best to eschew the precious metal smart investors recognize the opposite sentiment may be the more savvy one: The declining price of gold presents a great opportunity for long-term investors who recognize that gold will likely rebound. With this approach in mind let's dig into some of the most compelling opportunities for gold investment at the moment: Newmont (NEM 1.80%) Pretium Resources (PVG) and Royal Gold (RGLD 1.32%).

A dividend opportunity that's hardly fool's gold

Unlike REITs and utilities -- stocks that are often front and center on income investors' radars -- gold stocks rarely gain the interest of those looking to pick up some yield. However Newmont the largest publicly traded gold mining company based on market cap is bucking that trend. Currently the stock offers investors an eye-popping 3.6% forward dividend yield -- one of the highest yields available to gold-focused investors. Besides the high yield it's management's approach to the dividend that's also noteworthy.

The company has set a policy that provides for anannualized $1.00 per share base dividend with the price of gold above $1200 per ounce. In addition to the base Newmont targets returning 40% to 60% of free cash flow to investors through the dividend. For example should the price of gold average $1800 per ounce Newmont projects an annualized dividend of $2.20 to $2.80 per share and if the price of gold rose to $2100 per share the dividend would jump to $2.80 to $3.70 per share.

Although skeptics may scoff at the company's dividend policy the company is on solid footing regarding its financials which will help it to maintain the high degree to which it's rewarding shareholders. Newmont ended 2020 having generated record free cash flow of $3.6 billion and it's taking a conservative approach to leverage: Newmont currently has a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2.

Digging for gold in the Great White North

Unlike Newmont which has a massive portfolio of global assets Pretium Resources owns and operates only one asset: Brucejack located in northwestern British Columbia. Producing nearly 348000 gold ounces in 2020 Pretium Resources had a lot to celebrate last year thanks to its gold-mining operations at Brucejack.

For one Pretium Resources generated a record $369 million in free cash flow -- capital which management used to help shore up its balance sheet reducing its debt by $227 million. Consequently Pretium ended 2020 with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.5. Shifting the focus from last year to this year management forecasts (using a gold estimate of $1700 per ounce) free cash flow of about $145 million for2021.

Currently investors can find shares of Pretium Resources on the discount rack. The stock is trading at 6.5 times operating cash flow representing a discount to its 2019 and 2020 multiples of 10.2 and 7.3 respectively. Additionally shares are changing hands at about 10.6 times forward earnings notably lower than its five-year average ratio of32.

Go with the stream -- the gold stream that is

If investing in a gold-mining company doesn't quench your thirst for a gold stock Royal Gold a royalty and streaming company may be the right choice. Whereas companies like Newmont and Pretium take on significant risk in operating their gold assets Royal Gold acts more like a specialized financier providing capital to mining companies to finance their capital-intensive projects.

In exchange Royal Gold receives either a royalty a right to a percentage of the mining company's revenue or metals produced from a project or a stream the right to purchase the produced metal from a mining project at a preset price.

It's not only the company's business model that represents a lower degree of risk than a mining company. Royal Gold has exposure to a variety of other minerals mitigating the risk of a steep downturn in the price of gold. In 2020 for example gold accounted for 79% of the company's revenue.

The company's portfolio represents another way in which it shines. While mining companies must constantly strive to replenish their depleted assets Royal Gold has a portfolio that ensures growth. Of the 189 properties in its portfolio Royal Gold has 41 mineral-producing assets and 148 assets in varying phases of development.

Think the regal route is worth taking? Now's a great time. Shares of Royal Gold are trading hands at 18.8 times operating cash flow representing a discount to its five-year average multiple of 22.4.

The glittering takeaway for gold-minded investors

With gold prices declining so precipitously lately it may seem that it's not the right time to invest in the yellow stuff. Smart investors know that often the opposite rings true. For those looking to add some sheen to their holdings but who are similarly sensitive to risk Newmont is a great choice -- especially with its attractive dividend. Growth investors on the other hand may be more interested in Pretium Resources while those looking for an alternative would be well-suited to consider Royal Gold.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Now a special innovation team and a group of nearly 300 newsroom employees are pushing for drastic changes at the paper which has been part of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire since 2007.

Dr Stephen Hagan who led a successful push to rename Coon cheese is calling on the Blues to change its theme song which is set to the tune of Lily of Laguna a song in which the original lyrics centre on a black man pining after a Native American woman and a song frequently performed in black face.

Speaking to News Corp Hagan said he was “absolutely shocked” when reportedly told by the club several of its Indigenous players both past and present backed the club’s stance that its own lyrics “effectively removed the original song’s racist connotations”.

“I’m absolutely shocked they would defend the racist theme song music rather than fight against the clearly racist origins of the melody” Dr Hagan said.

“It doesn’t make the song any less racist that a couple of Aboriginal players who are very loyal to the club defend it.”

On the song itself Dr Hagan said Lily of Laguna “Is one of the most racist of all time with the opening verse including the n-word and ‘coon’ and Carlton has adopted that music and propelled it into notoriety.”

“Lily of Laguna is said to be one of the greats coon songs ever.”

Asked whether the song needed to be changed given the majority of footy fans and players wouldn’t recognise the 1989 tune he said “How do you think Jewish people would feel if Collingwood’s song was based on propaganda music from the Hitler Youth?”

Dr Hagan stressed that he wasn’t campaigning for the club to change its lyrics but rather commission a new song to base it on.

Responding to News Corp a Carlton spokesperson said “The Lily of Laguna lyrics are of no relevance to the lyrics that were penned in good faith for the club.“"

It's just killing small businesses. | Mike Sielski","Every wall inside Young’s Sneaker City on West Girard Avenue is stocked with sneakers black and white and swirled with candy colors all of them askew just so on display shelves and next to the cash register is the Nike wall. Not that anyone wants to buy any of the 25 shoes on the Nike wall. All of them have been sitting there for at least a year most of them longer styles whose coolness has come and gone some of them shrink-wrapped in cellophane some of them leaving dust on the fingertips of a customer who happens to pick one up.

That those shelves will soon be empty is a fact that the store’s owner Yong Lee takes for granted. Among the dwindling number of independent sneaker-store owners in and near the city and around the country he is not alone in his presumption. Since 2016 Nike has been pulling its products out of these retailers as part of its shift to a direct-to-consumer model and during the COVID-19 pandemic the company has accelerated that process killing off more of these small businesses denying a salve to the already-wounded survivors.

It’s quite the juxtaposition of image and reality: Nike the wokest of woke corporations paying millions to LeBron James and Colin Kaepernick to brand itself as the sneaker of protesters and rebels and champions of the counterculture ... but turning its back on the very retailers — often urban-centered often owned and frequented by people of color — that helped it build its empire. The company’s digital sales skyrocketed by 75% in the fourth quarter of the 2020 fiscal year and its currency-neutral revenues from China have been growing by at least 10% for six consecutive years.

To Nike most of its traditional stores and distributors — despite their value as longtime neighborhood institutions and cultivators of social capital — have become drags on its profit margin. They’re unnecessary second class. So their proprietors now just wait for the phone calls or emails if they haven’t received them already that their accounts have been terminated that the most popular sneakers on the market aren’t available to them anymore that the titan of the industry is telling them they’re on their own.

“Ten years ago I could have gotten everything I wanted” Lee 61 said. “Now they don’t give me anything my loyal customers want. If they sell only on their website they don’t need me.”

That’s the pretext of Nike’s entire strategy and the company doesn’t deign to acknowledge the costs. “In order to build more meaningful relationships with consumers” a Nike spokesperson said in a phone interview “we are doubling down on our approach with Nike Digital and our owned stores as well as a smaller number of strategic partners who share our vision to create a consistent connected and modern shopping experience.”

Under Armour and Adidas already have announced that they will use the same formula to try to keep up and it would be easier to accept this trend as a natural result of the evolution of capitalism and technology if Nike weren’t so cold and hypocritical about it if it didn’t peddle the value and integrity of “sacrificing everything” while forcing its current and former clients to do exactly that. It’s pulling out of some big-box retailers too — DSW Urban Outfitters Shoe Show — but it’s the little stores with so much more to lose that will suffer the most. And already have.

Just look around. Bounce from North Philadelphia to the 4600 block of Frankford Avenue where Joseph’s Sporting Goods is shuttered with a steel garage door to stretches of Chestnut and South Streets where the mom-and-pop shops that were once fixtures are long gone. Call Shoe Plus on Germantown Avenue; it’s “temporarily closed” and no one’s there to stop the phone from ringing forever.

Talk to William Woo Chung whose store Real McCoy had three locations — one at Broad and Olney one near Temple one in Camden — and relied on Nike for 70-80% of its sales. Chung closed those stores three years ago after Nike shut down his account. Drive out to the suburbs and towns around the city to The Run Around in Abington or Sneakin’ In in Bellmawr stores whose owners are hoping they’ve diversified their merchandise enough to hang on.

Listen to them recall how in the 1980s when Nike was a young company desperate to gain a foothold in the market its representatives would pull up to their stores the trunks of their cars loaded with wholesale sneakers. Those stores became the epicenters of a shakeup in the country’s pop and consumer culture: Air Jordans Air Maxes a grassroots spreading of the Gospel of JUST DO IT. Listen to those owners now the betrayal in their voices.

People who sought the freedom and self-determination and took on the risk that comes with starting a business ... people who want to try on sneakers before they buy them ... people who don’t have access to a computer or the Internet to one-click-shop — and there are more of them in Philadelphia than anyone might want to admit ... people who just want to support the small familiar places that are around the corner or across the street … these stores exist for and because of them and Nike despite all its social justice signaling and preening is telling those people that they don’t count.

“They live on perception and politically it makes a lot of sense” said one city store owner who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he still has a Nike account. “They control your livelihood and they know it. We are in the trenches. Customers tell us what they want. When something gets some traction Nike pulls it back and keeps it for themselves. When it comes down to taking care of the people who put you there they cut you off.”

They haven’t cut Yong Lee off yet but he presumes it’s only a matter of time before they do. Born in South Korea he immigrated to Philadelphia with his family in 1974 grew up on Wyoming Avenue went to Northeast High School and spent two years studying engineering at Penn State before his father died suddenly. He returned home never finishing his degree and opened his store 35 years ago.

His customers most of whom are Black are loyal to him and he to them. “They call me a legend” he said. He runs them tabs creates jobs. The clientele come in to browse and buy or just to hang out as if the store were a barbershop. When the protests and rioting last spring and summer jeopardized Lee’s business several residents and customers stood outside his front door guarding the store.

“During the looting this store ain’t get touched” one of those customers Christian Smith said “out of respect for him.”

Before the pandemic struck he would donate hundreds of pairs of sneakers to local schools and athletic associations each year. Seven plaques acknowledging him for his generosity hang in his storage area. There up a treacherous wooden ladder to the cramped second floor stand stacks of shoeboxes tall as towers full of Nike sneakers that he’ll never sell. For every pair of Jordan 1s — or whatever the latest hot shoe happens to be — that he gets Nike demands that he take 10 pairs of what one of his employees called “BS sneaks” the kinds that will never entice his customers the kinds that collect cobwebs and dust.

He’ll get by probably. He does all right with other brands which gives him some peace of mind. “Nike” he said “they come from China Vietnam cheap labor.” His twin sons Patrick and Andrew are 35 and plan to take over the store once he retires.

“I’m the Last [of the] Mohicans” he said.

What’s the price of a bond so strong between a father and his sons between a man and his community? It’s a question that Nike can’t be bothered to ask. Sometimes a click on a computer screen doesn’t just complete a connection. Sometimes it severs one too. Soon enough there will be another commercial another Twitter trend another urgent marketing message to strike a blow for equality by purchasing the right brand of sneakers. And soon enough another storefront will go dark in another forgotten neighborhood and we will wonder why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJhZS5jb20vMjAyMS80L25pa2UtYWlyLXpvb20tcGVnYXN1cy0zOC1ydW5uaW5nLXNuZWFrZXJzLW9mZmljaWFsLWxvb2stcmVsZWFzZS1kYXRlLWluZm_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 38 Runners Release Date,"Nike Shares Official Look at the Air Zoom Pegasus 38 Launching at the end of April.

Hideki Matsuyama is on the cusp of his first major title. Getty Images

Hideki Matsuyama is in position to make history at the Masters on Sunday by becoming the first Japanese player ever to win a major championship. But how familiar are you with the 29-year-old five-time PGA Tour winner? Here are five things to know.

1. Hideki Matsuyama leads a very private life

Despite being subject to his every move being chronicled on the golf course by an ever-present contingent of Japanese media Matsuyama was described in 2017 as “really really shy” by Eiko Oizumi a writer and photographer for Golf Today Japan. “He doesn’t want to show his private life” Oizumi told GOLF’s Alan Bastable adding that Japanese reporters are reluctant to ask him questions about his off-course pursuits for fear of making him uncomfortable.

2. Hideki Matsuyama is a husband — and a father!

At the 2017 Northern Trust Matsuyama revealed that he had not only gotten married that January but also welcomed his first child in July of that year. So why the secrecy? “No one really asked me if I was married so I didn’t have to answer that question” he said. “But I felt that after the PGA would be a good time because our baby is born and I thought that would be a good time to let everyone know.”

3. Hideki Matsuyama has already won a trophy at Augusta National

Back in 2011 Matsuyama was a 19-year-old amateur playing in his first Masters — the first Japanese amateur ever to do so. He ended up finishing T27 good enough to claim low amateur honors and the silver cup which was presented to him in Butler Cabin.

4. Hideki Matsuyama is big fan of sake

When Matsuyama was asked at the 2017 Tournament of Champions about the most fun thing he did during the short off-season he had a winning answer.

“Probably drinking sake” Matsuyama said through his interpreter. “I had my share. It wasn’t just a little. We did party pretty good.”

Hideki Matsuyama has been knocking at the door of winning a major championship for years now and it appears he is finally going to get over the hump at this year’s Masters. Should that happen people are going to learn a lot more about the Japanese superstar … maybe.

Matsuyama is notoriously a very private person. Some of that has to do with the language barrier as he predominantly speaks with the media through his interpreter Bob Turner. Matsuyama has also admitted he does not love interacting with reporters as he admitted on Saturday that it has been easier on him with less media and fans at the Masters due to COVID-19 protocols.

“I’m not sure how to answer this in a good way but being in front of the media is still difficult” Matsuyama said through Turner according to Alan Bastable of Golf.com. “I’m glad the media are here covering it but it’s not my favorite thing to do to stand and answer questions. And so with fewer media it’s been a lot less stressful for me.”

So while we know very little about Matsuyama we do know he is married and has at least one child — a daughter. The 29-year-old shared the news at The Northern Trust back in August 2017 that he and his wife had welcomed a baby the month before. Bastable says that was a shock to reporters who didn’t even know Matsuyama was married.

“No one really asked me if I was married so I didn’t have to answer that question” Matsuyama said. “But I felt that after the PGA would be a good time because our baby is born and I thought that would be a good time to let everyone know.”

The PGA Tour’s website says Matsuyama’s wife’s name is Mei and his daughter’s name is Kanna.

Matsuyama is looking to become the first male Japanese golfer to win a major. He had a very simple message entering the final round as the leader at the Masters. If he can capture his first green jacket the media will be itching to learn more about him."

As Navy innovators work intensely to pioneer new methods of undersea communication many might wish to reflect upon the decades of technical challenges associated with bringing any kind of undersea real-time connectivity to submarine operations. Historically certain kinds of low-frequency radio have enabled limited degrees of slow more general kinds of communication yet by and large submarines have had to surface to at least periscope depth to achieve any kind of substantial connectivity.

The advent of new kinds of transport layer communications coupled with emerging technologies woven into unmanned systems are beginning to introduce potential new avenues of data processing and transmission intended to bring greater degrees of real-time undersea data transmission to fruition.

Sea water diminishes the power of electrical transmission challenges identified many years ago by the Navy and some of its partners who have been working on under communication for decades such as Northrop Grumman. Northrop’s efforts date back to the World War II era and along with the Navy and other industry contributors helped pioneer the innovations that helped adapt RF communications architecture to sonar today. Considering this history there are some interesting synergies woven through various elements of undersea warfare radio communications.

A 2014 essay by Carlos Altgelt titled “The World’s Largest “Radio” Station” details some of the historic elements of how the U.S. Navy pursued Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) undersea connectivity. Through its discussion of low-frequency ELF connectivity the essay explains the technical challenges associated with undersea communication which seem to align with how Northrop Grumman innovators describe how undersea communications will need to largely evolve in the areas of acoustics and optics.

As Altgelt notes: “As a result of the high electrical conductivity of sea water signals are attenuated rapidly as they propagate downward through it. In effect sea water ‘hides’ the submarine from detection while simultaneously preventing it from communicating with the outside world through conventional high-frequency radio transmissions. In order to receive these a submarine must travel at slow speed and be near the surface unfortunately both of these situations make a submarine more susceptible to enemy detection.”

Alan Lytle vice president of Strategy & Mission Solutions Maritime/Land Systems & Sensors division Northrop Grumman told The National Interest about several innovations intended to address some of these challenges. For example regarding a need to “see” and “detect” more undersea Lytle said Northrop Grumman’s µSAS synthetic aperture sonar can combine with advanced machine-learning algorithms to automatically detect threats on the bottom.

Some of the technical challenges and communications form part of the inspirational basis for newer kinds of undersea drones engineered with advanced levels of autonomy such that they can find track detect and even detonate or explode enemy targets such as sea-mines without needing human intervention.

As part of this manned-unmanned teaming equation the Navy seeks to further harness its growing fleet of air surface and undersea drones according to Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday’s CNO NAVPLAN 2021.

“They (unmanned systems) will expand our intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance advantage add depth to our missile magazines and provide additional means to keep our distributed force provisioned” Gilday writes.

Gilday’s text brings a few things to mind as he mentioned drones in the specific context of ISR something which of course pertains to undersea connectivity and reconnaissance missions. His reference to a “distributed” force also seems quite deliberate as longer range higher-fidelity secure undersea connectivity is crucial to the Navy’s Distributed Maritime Operations strategy which envisions a disaggregated yet networked force intended to leverage newer longer-range kinds of surveillance technologies. This is precisely the kind of tactical circumstance in which unmanned undersea drones can play an integral part especially when empowered with higher-speed GPS-like undersea connectivity.

Mullen chair of the Cornell Progressives’ Anti-War Committee hopes to introduce a resolution to the Student Assembly later this week that would encourage the University to terminate all Cornell partnerships with institutions in Saudi Arabia disclose all grants and donations from Saudi Arabian institutions and the investment of such funds into organizations fighting for the Yemeni people.

Mullen also called for the immediate end of Cornell Engineering’s corporate partnerships with arms manufacturers and barring these corporations from recruiting at Cornell. Companies with these partnerships include Northrop Grumman Boeing Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems. More broadly Mullen wants Cornell to publicly condemn the war in Yemen and cease business with any company profiting from the war.

Mullen alleged that Saudi Arabia has committed a variety of war atrocities including bombing school buses and hospitals blockading Yemen and exacerbating a famine that is starving civilians.

In 2008 Cornell won a $25 million grant from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology. In 2018 professors and faculty asked the University to disclose all donations from Saudi Arabia and end any partnerships with the regime but according to Mullen this request was never fulfilled.

Because of the impact of the blockade and Saudi Arabia’s bombing of Yemeni medical facilities Mullen considers the Saudi Arabian government fitting of divestment.

”If a nation or a company is engaging in genocide that should meet the qualification for divestment or disengagement” Mullen said.

Mullen also criticized Cornell Engineering’s partnerships with corporations that sell weapons to the Saudi government. Specifically he pointed to Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems who partner with Cornell Engineering in graduate programs for current employees to get a masters degree. On top of that Lockheed Martin donated $63000 to Cornell Engineering for undergraduate student research projects workshops design teams and peer-mentor programming.

This proposed resolution continues the trend of the Student Assembly’s involvement in Cornell’s international affairs. Last week the SA passed Resolution 39 which called on Cornell to uphold ethical guidelines when collaborating with international institutions specifically with the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University in China.

Mullen’s resolution is intended to continue the Student Assembly’s goal of ensuring ethical collaboration with foreign governments.

NASA had previously faced challenges in accomplishing this research due to lack of equipment as it needed a lightweight product which was easy to operate. It is in this respect that eMoyo’s KUDUwave provides the answers to NASA’s plight.

The KUDUwave is a portable high-frequency audiometer featuring booth-free operation and high-frequency hearing testing up to 16 kHz. It has been used to test audio deficiencies in South Africa as far back as 2009. The KUDUwave Pro combines the sound booth audiometers bone conductor and extended high-frequency headset in a single lightweight device. It includes the full battery of testing options as well as the ability to test almost anywhere.

NASA recruited the KUDUwave portable boothless audiometer and has transported it to the ISS via a commercial resupply mission known as the Northrop Grumman NG aboard the CRS-15 Cygnus spacecraft. The audiometer while innovative in its own right had to be “slightly modified for self-testing in space” according to eMoyo executive John Tidy. In addition to this KUDUwave had to meet the following requirements.

The ability to provide valid clinical data.

Providing a web-based solution that’s compatible with NASA’s computer OS.

A lightweight form factor.

Being simple enough for astronauts to use independently without assistance from Mission Control.

The ability to test middle ear function.

The ability to monitor and report on background noise levels.

Launched on the 20th of February 2021. The KUDUwave audiometer will aid astronauts aboard the ISS in performing hearing tests scheduled to begin in May.

“This is a truly South African story. The will the grit and the determination to create a product that will change the lives of so many people and we at eMoyo are so proud to be a part of that change” Jillian Scotland COO of eMoyo says."

A US bodybuilder has come under fire on social media for boasting about his eight-month-old baby son being ""lean"" as a result of his strict diet.

Jack Reynolds posted on Twitter about his ""unusually handsome son"" and revealed what he eats listing eggs fruit and vegetables.

""We grind up his vegetables/proteins most the time until he can chomp away on his own"" he wrote on Twitter under his handle @RedepmtiveKing.

He went on to share his son's stats and said while he was in the 99 per cent for his height and head size he measured in the 70 percentile for weight.

""He's lean bc he isn't eating processed sh*t"" added the dad.

We feed our 8mo son:



Whole eggs

Whole fruit

Whole vegetables

H2O



We grind up his vegetables/proteins most the time until he can chomp away on his own



99% percentile height/head size



70% percentile weight



He’s lean bc he isn’t eating processed sh*t



And unusually handsome.. pic.twitter.com/ijIG0PY8jv — DrJrey ⚡️ (@RedemptiveKing) April 4 2021

The tweet included a photo of himself with his partner and son but with their faces blurred.

While some applauded the dad for providing the best for his son others described his post as ""gross"".

""Ah yes ... 'lean baby' is a normal thing to brag about"" one tweeted.

""That kid is going to have disordered eating by the time they're 10"" said one user.

""I've never heard anyone describe their baby as lean before good luck to this baby"" noted another.

""This is an excellent way to make absolutely sure your child grows up extremely body insecure. Good job getting an early start messing up his sense of self worth"" wrote one woman.

Others mocked the dad. ""I feed my 8-month-old red bull and taco bell. he's 4 feet tall and would easily defeat your child in hand-to-hand combat"" joked one man.

""I stopped feeding my kids anything at 3 months. If you're old enough to crawl you're old enough to scavenge"" someone wrote. ""How are they gonna learn to be self sufficient if you coddle them like this?""

But Reynolds called out the ""viral cesspool"" of social media after the influx of negative tweets.

If he truly admires and loves his father



And if his father (me) remains disciplined and thus jacked



Then I believe I can instill in him a gentle passion for aesthetics at a young age



He will understand what aesthetic means



And he will understand why McDonald’s isn’t that https://t.co/HIwypbNHxd — DrJrey ⚡️ (@RedemptiveKing) April 4 2021

""My baby tweet from yesterday is getting all these retweets today ... Whenever I wake up to this I'm reminded of the viral cesspool that is social media & its algorithms"" he wrote.

""So much ugly nrg (energy) and projected delusions floating around the internet.""

He also revealed that his mum fed him a lot of processed foods when he was a baby resulting in him becoming ""addicted to eating"" and ""chunky"".

""My mom definitely had a lot going on at the time but I know she regrets not doing whole foods"" he replied to one user. ""I am certain it made me start to feel as a kid a sort of deep sadness that drove me to end up getting addicted to eating. Once chunky the negative thoughts took over. Eat healthy!""

He followed up his lean tweet with one about wanting to instill a ""gentle passion for aesthetics"" and not McDonald's in his son.

People were concerned about his son's diet. Photo / Instagram

The fit dad then went on to retweet a number of responses from fans defending his views.

""Seeing people trying to hate on /bring down @RedemptiveKing is honestly disheartening. JRey is one of the best human beings I have met and can honestly say the purest individual I know"" said one. ""And people *STILL* found a way to hate on him and his beautiful family. Soulless. Head up King.""

Without question the biggest problem are resellers on eBay and other resale sites - or dastardly profiteers according to desperate gamers looking to upgrade their rigs. There are even entire collectives of resellers buying up all available stock using bots and other means to corner the market for these products which are seeing unprecedented demand.

Compounding the problem component parts like RAM and semiconductors are facing supply bottlenecks resulting in shortages of the parts needed to churn out more cards to meet the demand. And since these parts are needed for everything from graphics cards to video game consoles and even to cars this is a much bigger problem than just GPUs.

To make this perfect storm of supply woes even worse just as the latest graphics cards started to hit the market in the fall and winter of 2020 Ethereum and Bitcoin values started to soar. Whether this was a product of the new more powerful GPUs making it to market or just really bad timing in either case demand for graphics cards of all stripes started to soar as crypto-49ers gobbled up whatever they could find looking to make it big in the cryptocurrency boom.

Since returns for mining cryptocurrency suddenly spiked many miners have been willing to pay the premium being charged by resellers online so long as they could make their profitability formulas come out positive in the end. How much of the problem of resellers overlaps with cryptocurrency mining isn't clear not even to Nvidia but unlike all the other issues mining is at least a problem that Nvidia could try to address directly.

The question is whether their solution dedicated cryptomining processors (CMPs) will be enough to help alleviate some of the demand pressure on their new Ampere cards so that these cards can be more easily purchased by the gamers who want them.

Unfortunately some recent reports and leaked specs on one of these new CMPs isn't very promising.

Hashing profits out of graphics cards

To understand why Nvidia's CMP doesn't look like a great solution we're going to compare the newest graphics cards from both Nvidia and AMD and see how well they do when mining Ethereum. To keep things simple we're going to use US dollars for comparison sake since the value itself isn't what matters but the difference between the cards which will be consistent across currencies other than USD.

We're also focusing on Ethereum rather than Bitcoin since ETH is the cryptocurrency that is currently ""booming"" right now and drawing the most attention from miners - especially newbies.

Without going into too much detail about how cryptomining works the thing that matters here is the formula cryptominers use to measure whether its worth buying a graphics card for cryptomining. It's not a complicated formula and the math isn't very hard but to spare us a bunch of equations on the page we use the CryptoCompare Ethereum Mining Profitability calculator.

There are a lot of moving variables when mining including power use hash rates (measured in megahashes per second or MH/s) and the price of ETH so we're going to staple a couple of variables to the wall and focus on hash rates. The power consumption will be left at what the cards specs list as the board's power draw and we're using my current kWh rate of $0.111724. None of our calculations take into account the price of the card itself when determining profitability we'll get to that in a bit.

With these constraints we look at Nvidia's CMP specs and calculate a rough profitability based on what we know. Starting from the lower end the Nvidia 30HX has a hash rate of 26 MH/s the 40HX rate is 36 MH/s the 50HX rate is 45 MH/s with the highest end CMP the 90HX coming in with 90 MH/s.

In our calculations these cards generate $1.94 $2.65 $3.26 and $7.00 of profit a day at current ETH prices. Of all the currently available Ampere and Radeon RX 6000-series cards only the RTX 3060 with the hash rate limiter enabled has a profitability significantly below the CMPs with $1.47 a day. Turn off the hash rate limiter which miners have already figured out how to do and the RTX 3060's profitability jumps to $3.47 a day which is still the lowest profitability of any of the next-gen cards but is greater than every CMP other than the 90HX.

The 90HX's profitability of $7.00 beats out the profitability of every card other than the RTX 3090 which earns about $9.71 a day in profit. The other cards fall in between with the RTX 3060 Ti earning $4.53 the RTX 3070 earning $4.66 and the RTX 3080 earning $6.83 a day. The AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT earns $3.61 a day the RX 6800 earns $4.43 a day and the RX 6800 XT and RX 6900 XT earning $5.19 a day.

Ultimately the only CMP that could make a significant dent in the mining demand for next-gen graphics cards based on profitability alone is the 90HX which isn't going to be available for a few months. Not good.

Why cryptomining processors aren't likely to make a difference in graphics card stock

Earlier this month a bunch of smugglers in Hong Kong got a large cache of 30HX CMPs seized by customs officials which is the first time anyone has really seen these cards in the wild. How the smugglers got their hands on the cards is an open question since the cards don't seem to be on sale anywhere.

The only time we saw a CMP for sale was at Microless in the United Arab Emirates which was briefly selling the 30HX for about $723 before the page was taken down. Price gouging on RTX and RX cards is wild right now so you probably can't get an RTX 3060 for its starting MSRP of $329 - and aftermarket cards are a bit pricier if you can find them online - but they aren't more than double their MSRP. And with the ability to unlock the hash rate limiter the RTX 3060 is still much more likely to break even if the price of ETH crashes.

The problem just scales up as you move on to pricier cards. If the 40HX 50HX and 90HX are priced anywhere near proportional to the price of the 30HX we've seen these cards simply aren't going to be either profitable or resellable. At least an RTX 3090 can be resold to desperate gamers on eBay. If the price of ETH crashes no one is going to want to buy a CMP.

The case of the 30HX smuggling ring also doesn't point to its adoption by large scale mining operations that are hoovering up every graphics card on Earth right now. In fact it points to the probability that even large scale miners can't find any graphics cards either and after turning to RTX 3000-series laptops to fill in the gap a few hundred CMPs are better than nothing - especially if they ""fell"" out the back of a shipping container before leaving the port of Hong Kong.

This all points to CMPs not being replacements for RTX cards but last-resort options for miners for large-scale mining operations. That means these will likely be the first cards they swap out once more RTX and RX cards become available.

Ultimately the only way cryptomining stops diverting graphics cards around the world from the gamers they were originally intended for is the way all such things get resolved. The cryptoboom needs to go bust and the price of ETH and BTC needs to tank at which point we'll see an absolute glut of graphics cards on eBay and other sites from miners looking to get whatever they can for the overpriced graphics cards they bought up during the gold rush. Hopefully that will put an end to resellers buying up new stock and maybe give at least some of us a chance to get our hands on one of these cards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtZ3B1LXZpcnR1YWxpemF0aW9uLXVubG9ja2VkLW9uLWNsaWVudC1ncHVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia's Virtualization Unlocked On Gaming GPUs via Hack,"A group of enthusiasts has unlocked vGPU (GPU virtualization) capability which is only supported on select datacenter and professional boards on standard consumer Nvidia GeForce gaming graphics cards. Since the vGPU capability is supported by the silicon but locked out by software it was only a matter of time and effort before enthusiasts unlocked the feature. As it turns out according to a Reddit post that time has come potentially saving some users the thousands of dollars they would otherwise have to shell out for a Quadro or Tesla GPU that supports the feature.



GPU virtualization which allows more than one user to use a GPU simultaneously is one of the differentiators between GPUs for data centers and those designed for consumer PCs. Nowadays many workstations and even high-end desktops are located remotely so the users can share the GPUs. Modern hardware is so powerful that its performance is sometimes excessive for one user so sharing one graphics card between multiple users makes sense.

From a GPU hardware perspective virtualization is just another feature so the silicon supports it. But this capability requires a lot of software to work properly (i.e. how companies that buy workstations expect it to) and validation with ISVs since virtualized GPUs are in many cases used for professional applications.



All of these things cost money so vGPU support comes at a price and Nvidia has a handful of expensive Tesla Quadro and some other GPUs it recommends for virtualization (partly because it does not make a lot of sense to validate a broad fleet of hardware with ISVs). Nvidia's vGPU software does not support most client GPUs. Nvidia did recently open up GPU passthrough via a driver update but this only allows a single VM to access the GPU whereas full vGPU support allows multiple VMs to share the same GPU.

The code for the vGPU unlocker is available at Github and the principle behind it is fairly simple: it replaces the device id of a graphics card with a device id of an officially supported GPU that has the same feature set. For now GP102 GP104 TU102 TU104 and GA102 GPUs are supported and the capability works on Linux and with KVM virtual machine software.

While the new unlocking technique deserves some attention the big question is whether your typical consumer actually needs GPU virtualization. Linux users can virtualize their high-end graphics cards and use them for gaming video encoding and cryptocurrency mining simultaneously on different virtual machines.

Some of those who happen to have servers with hundreds or thousands of consumer Nvidia GPUs could try to offer commercial remote desktop services to earn money but the quality of such services would be something to worry about. Since the hack does not work with Windows and Vmware it is useless for most users.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2dwdS12aXJ0dWFsaXphdGlvbi1mdW5jdGlvbnMtb24tbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtY2FyZHMtd2l0aC1zaW1wbGUtbW9kL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2dwdS12aXJ0dWFsaXphdGlvbi1mdW5jdGlvbnMtb24tbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtY2FyZHMtd2l0aC1zaW1wbGUtbW9kL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Simple Mod Unlocks GPU Virtualization On NVIDIA GeForce Graphics Cards,"At this point any limit NVIDIA places on its products won't last very long. The hash rate limiter on the GeForce RTX 3060 was cracked on many occasions in different ways. The latest limitation to be cracked is the locked GPU virtualization on GeForce cards. The simple mod 'vgpu_unlock' has enabled GPU virtualization on consumer-level cards.

NVIDIA GeForce Cards Can Enable GPU Virtualization With A Simple Mod That Changes The Device ID To A Supported GPU

GPU virtualization is a way of distributing graphics processing power to multiple users essentially allowing multiple users to use a single GPU. This feature is something that differentiates data center GPUs from consumer GPUs. This technology has many use cases including scientific research done by multiple people on a single GPU but the most notable of all is GeForce NOW which uses GRID GPUs to power the virtual gaming experience.

Source: VMware

The silicon was never the issue with vGPU on consumer cards it was the software that locked out the user. Previously to use vGPU users would have to pay a hefty price for an NVIDIA Tesla or Quadro card. vGPU also requires a lot of software to work well and validation with ISVs. NVIDIA's current vGPU software does not support consumer cards but that could be subject to change as GPU passthrough the software that allows a single VM to access a GPU was added to GeForce cards via a driver update.

The mod to get vGPU working is quite simple. It replaces the device ID of an NVIDIA graphics card with a device ID of an officially supported GPU. This works on GP102 GP104 TU102 TU104 and GA102 GPUs for Linux and KVM VM software. It's hard to think of the use case for consumers needing GPU virtualization since this mod doesn't even function with Windows or VMware.

The code for this mod is available on GitHub and it was originally spotted out by Tom's Hardware. It's unfortunate it does not work on Windows because we could have potentially seen consumers do some crypto mining while gaming.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9udmlkaWEtYW5ub3VuY2VzLWVpZ2h0LW5ldy1hbXBlcmUtYmFzZWQtZ3B1c9IBLWh0dHBzOi8vbW9iaWxlLmVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLmNvbS9hbXAvMjE1ODAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA Announces Eight New Ampere-Based GPUs,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vaG90aGFyZHdhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvdW5sb2NrLW52aWRpYS12aXJ0dWFsaXphdGlvbi1nZWZvcmNlLWdwdXMtc29mdHdhcmUtaGFja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How To Unlock NVIDIA Virtualization On GeForce GPUs With A Simple Software Hack,"



One of the features supported by NVIDIA's line of professional graphics cards is GPU virtualization. It is a potentially handy feature in some environments as it enables more than one person to tap into a single GPU through virtualization software. The feature is not officially available on NVIDIA's consumer GPUs but as it turns out can enabled with a rather simple hack.





This is really more of a 'gee-whiz' kind of thing than a game changer in the land of consumer GPUs as we reckon the vast majority of GeForce graphics card owners will not have a need for this. For those who do however there is the potential to save a lot of money by buying a consumer graphics card rather than a professional graphics card (Quadro or Tesla ) if GPU virtualization is the main selling point (once the shortage is behind us anyway).





It's also interesting because in today's landscape working remotely is more prominent than it was before the pandemic.





""With vGPU software licenses companies can use their on-premises NVIDIA GPUs to provide accelerated virtual infrastructure so people can work and collaborate from anywhere. Companies can also temporarily repurpose NVIDIA GPUs being used on other projects to support their remote workers"" NVIDIA explains.













The lack of support on consumer GPUs is entirely software based. However GeForce owners who want to unlock GPU virtualization on their graphics card can grab the code at GitHub . It effectively replaces the graphics card's device ID with one from a supported GPU.





""In order to determine if a certain GPU supports the vGPU functionality the driver looks at the PCI device ID. This identifier together with the PCI vendor ID is unique for each type of PCI device. In order to enable vGPU support we need to tell the driver that the PCI device ID of the installed GPU is one of the device IDs used by a vGPU capable GPU"" the release notes state.





This hack works on GP102 GP104 TU102 TU104 and GA102 GPUs though there is a pretty big caveat—this does not work on Windows just Linux with Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) software running. That limits the potential appeal though for Linux users who might need something like this well there you go.

The former Penn State football tight end announced via Twitter Sunday night that he’ll transfer to Old Dominion where Rahne became the head coach shortly after the 2019 season. Kuntz entered the transfer portal this past February.

The Camp Hill Pennsylvania native spent three seasons in Happy Valley. He arrived in the same class as Pat Freiermuth and was ranked as the No. 4 tight end in the nation. Despite earning more attention on the recruiting trail Kuntz spent much of his time in a rotational role behind Freiermuth.

The 6’7″ tight end made three catches over the course of the 2018 and 2019 seasons worth 26 yards but didn’t make any receptions in seven games played last fall.

Despite the former four-star recruit’s transfer Penn State and its new tight ends coach Ty Howle has no shortage of depth in the group. With Freiermuth off to the NFL Brenton Strange and Theo Johnson are poised to be key factors in 2021.

Strange made 17 grabs and scored twice as a redshirt freshman in 2020. Johnson didn’t get in the end zone as a true freshman but impressed towards the end of the season by making four catches worth 56 yards in the final three games.

Callihan’s victory came in the second of two Late Model Duels at Dominion Raceway. After starting fourth Callihan worked his way methodically up to the second position and battled with race leader John Goin for several circuits making the race deciding pass for the win with eight laps to go.

“This win is by far the biggest in my Late Model career for many reasons” Callihan told Short Track Scene. “I’m just your average guy little money with a lot of determination and on Saturday that was enough to get the job done against some of the best if not the best in Late Model racing right now. My crew chief Hippie did an amazing job giving me what I was asking for and keeping up with the track. I’m just really proud of all my guys that take time to come help me do something I love on the weekends.

“My last win was at Old Dominion in 2012” Callihan continued. “This win means a lot to me. All the hard work paying off gives you confidence as a driver.”

Callihan hails from Woodford Virginia and was a regular at Old Dominion Speedway prior to that track’s closure in 2012. When Old Dominion closed track owner Steve Britt had already planned on building a new track in nearby Spotsylvania County in Virginia – which opened in 2016. In the years between the closure of Old Dominion and the opening of Dominion Callihan competed in Motocross racing.

“The years between Old Dominion and Dominion I went back to racing Motocross due to lack of sponsors and funding” Callihan explained. “It was fun to be back on dirt for a little while but as they say with age get a cage. After a big injury racing on two wheels left me in the hospital for a week I migrated back to four wheels and worked my way back into the Late Model class.”

Prior to his win on Saturday Callihan had picked up 10 wins in the Dominion Racer division which is the name of the track’s Limited Late Model class.

The first race was won by Doug Barnes over Mason Bailey and Grayson Cullather.

GUANGZHOU China — If you talk about chipmaking two companies usually spring to mind — Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung Electronics. The two Asian firms combined control more than 70% of the semiconductor manufacturing market. The U.S. which was once a leader lags behind in this space after monumental shifts in the business models in the semiconductor industry. But a global semiconductor shortage and geopolitical tensions with China have bolstered Washington's scrutiny of the supply chain which is concentrated in the hands of a small number of players and has created a drive to bring manufacturing back to American soil to regain leadership. The U.S. has earmarked billions of dollars and is reportedly looking at alliances with other nations. Semiconductors are critical to everything from cars to the smartphones we use. And they have also been thrust into the center of U.S.-China tensions. ""One characteristic of US policy is that it has heavy emphasis on China. This has now become a national imperative to enhance self-sufficiency in semis production accelerated by the recent chip shortages and the 'tech war' against China"" Bank of America said in a note published Wednesday.

How Asia came to dominate manufacturing

The key to understanding the geopolitics of semiconductors which countries dominate and why the U.S. is trying to boost its domestic industry lies in coming to grips with the supply chain and business models. Companies like Intel are integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) which design and manufacture their own chips. Then there are the fabless semiconductor firms which design chips but outsource manufacturing to so-called foundries. The two biggest foundries are TSMC in Taiwan and Samsung Electronics in South Korea.

Narumon Bowonkitwanchai | Moment | Getty Images

Over the last 15 years or so companies began shifting to this fabless model. TSMC and Samsung took advantage as they began to invest heavily in leading-edge manufacturing technology. Now if a company like Apple wants to get the latest chip for their iPhone produced they have to turn to TSMC to do it. TSMC has 55% foundry market share and Samsung has 18% according to data from Trendforce. Taiwan and South Korea collectively have 81% of the global market in foundries highlighting the dominance and reliance on these two countries as well as on TSMC and Samsung.

""In 2001 30 companies manufactured at the leading edge however as semi manufacturing grew in cost and difficulty this number has fallen to just 3 firms"" — TSMC Intel and Samsung according to a note from Bank of America published in December. However Intel's manufacturing process is still behind that of TSMC and Samsung. ""Taiwan and South Korea have become leaders in wafer fabrication which requires massive capital investment; and part of their success over the last 20 years is due to supportive government policies and access to skilled labour forces"" Neil Campling head of technology media and telecoms research at Mirabaud Securities told CNBC by email.

The complex supply chain

While TSMC and Samsung are the dominant manufacturers of semiconductors they still rely heavily on equipment and machinery from the U.S. Europe and Japan. The companies that make these tools required by foundries are known as semiconductor capital equipment vendors or ""semicap"" for short. The top five semicap equipment vendors make up nearly 70% of the market according to Bank of America citing Gartner data. Three of the five are U.S. companies one is European and one is Japanese. Netherlands-based ASML is the only company in the world that can make so-called extreme ultraviolet (EUV) which is required to make the most advanced chips such as those manufactured by TSMC and Samsung.

What is the U.S. planning and why?

So the U.S. is not necessarily falling behind in the semiconductor industry as a whole. Some of its firms are integral to the supply chain. But one area it has lagged in is manufacturing. Under President Joe Biden the U.S. is looking to regain leadership in manufacturing and secure supply chains. In February Biden signed an executive order which involves a review of the semiconductor supply chain to identify risks. As part of a $2 trillion economic stimulus package $50 billion was earmarked for semiconductor manufacturing and research. A bill known as the CHIPS for America Act is also working its way through the legislative process and aims to provide incentives to enable advanced research and development and secure the supply chain.

Meanwhile U.S. firm Intel last month announced plans to spend $20 billion to build two new chip factories and said it will act as a foundry. This could offer a domestic alternative to the likes of TSMC and Samsung. Part of that scrutiny on the supply chain has been prompted by a global chip shortage that's hit the automotive industry. The coronavirus pandemic accelerated demand for personal electronics like laptops and games consoles just as industrials and automakers wound down production. But a rebound in production plus heightened demand for chips in various sectors has triggered a shortage. The concentration of production in the hands of TSMC and Samsung has worsened the problem. The semiconductor supply shortage ""has probably made the U.S. administration realise they aren't in control of their own destiny"" according to Mirabaud Securities' Campling. But there are also geopolitical factors at play informing U.S. policy. ""Over the longer-term the Biden administration wants to continue to encourage both foreign and U.S. semiconductor manufacturers to expand capacity in the U.S. to reduce dependence on manufacturing in geopolitically sensitive areas such as Taiwan and create high paying engineering jobs in the U.S."" Paul Triolo head of the geo-technology practice at Eurasia Group told CNBC by email.

Part of the U.S. policy in the semiconductor space involves forming alliances. Earlier this month the Nikkei reported that the U.S. and Japan will cooperate on supply chains for critical components like semiconductors. The two sides will aim for a system where production is not concentrated on specific regions like Taiwan the Nikkei said. ""The U.S. is trying to cut China out of the equation"" Abishur Prakash a geopolitical specialist at the Center for Innovating the Future a Toronto-based consulting firm told CNBC via email. ""It is trying to redesign how the world's chip industry works in the face of a rising China. This is not necessarily about self-sufficiency although Washington would welcome this. Instead it is about building up critical sectors — from AI to chips — that are insulated from geopolitics. And because several nations share U.S. concerns about China the U.S. is taking a chunk of the world with it.""

China's push for self-sufficiency

China meanwhile is trying to push self-sufficiency amid U.S. moves to cut it off from key supplies. Over the past few years China has tried to boost its semiconductor industry through huge investments and incentives like tax breaks. But China remains well behind everywhere else and that goes back to the supply chain. SMIC is China's largest foundry a competitor to the likes of TSMC and Samsung. But SMIC's technology is several years behind that of its Taiwan and South Korean rivals.

The White House's summit on the global chip shortage scheduled for Monday with many multinational companies which excludes virtually all key players from the Chinese mainland is another Washington-led push to decouple from China in semiconductors analysts said on Sunday.Such a plot will only end up exacerbating global supply woes as chip producers may suspend investment plans over political risks. The chip sector also requires close international cooperation among different parts of the industry chain to achieve economies of scale so excluding China will drive up costs observers said.Chief executives from about 20 companies including Google parent Alphabet AT&T General Motors Samsung Dell Technologies Intel Corp and TSMC which is based in the island of Taiwan are reportedly set to participate in a White House virtual meeting on Monday billed as a ""CEO Summit on Semiconductor and Supply Chain Resilience"" Reuters reported.White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo will also take part in the meeting according to the report.Participants will discuss how to strengthen the US supply chain for semiconductors CNBC reported citing the White House.""Almost all Chinese [mainland] high-tech companies are absent from the meeting even though they are key stakeholders in the global chip shortage. This underscores Washington's malicious aim to unite its alliance and decouple from China across the semiconductor industry chain from design and manufacturing to application"" Ma Jihua a Beijing-based industry analyst told the Global Times on Sunday.China accounts for roughly 45 percent of global chip demand each year relevant data showed.Fu Liang an independent veteran telecom industry observer in Beijing told the Global Times on Sunday that the US may also seek to use its global influence at the meeting to control the global supply chain and make it tilt more toward US companies.""Washington has deemed chips as a weapon to contain China's tech rise and also as a key bargaining chip at the negotiating table"" Ma explained.The US has elevated the development of the chip industry into a national strategy for political gains. Since February the Biden administration has embarked on a review of key US supply chains including semiconductors aiming to make them less reliant on other countries.But industry insiders said that such ""back stabbing"" will only backfire and cause dire consequences for US chip firms and global supply.The ongoing chip crisis which has rocked industries ranging from vehicles to mobile phones to game consoles and TVs was partly fueled by the US' confrontation with China under the former Trump administration observers said.""Chip companies had to suspend research and development (R&D) investment due to mounting uncertainties which delayed their production and led to the shortage"" Ma said.""If the US also aims to exclude China this time relevant global companies will again be forced to take sides out of political considerations and some will hold off on investment to expand production to trade off their interests in the Chinese market and US hegemony.""SEMI the US semiconductor design and manufacturing industry association said in September that US export controls imposed in May 2020 have ""resulted in $17 million lost sales of US-origin items to firms unrelated to Huawei"" according to a report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.From a long-term perspective the US' decoupling push also goes against semiconductor development rules which call for close and focused collaboration industry insiders said. The industry will be unable to generate economies of scale to cut costs if China - as a key player - is excluded.China in contrast to the US has been a firm promoter of global cooperation. In March the China Semiconductor Industry Association an association of 774 Chinese chip companies said that it was cooperating with its US counterpart to establish a working group on information sharing and bilateral communications over trade barriers supply-chain security and other related issues.China is also climbing up the ladder to create self-reliant semiconductor technology.Chinese chip firm SMIC recently made breakthroughs in a 7-nanometer-like process media reports said. Chip designer Innosilicon announced that it has completed a chip tape-out and testing based on SMIC's FinFET N+1 technology which is very similar to the advanced 7-nm process used by other world leading chipmakers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL0J1c2luZXNzL1RlY2gvU2VtaWNvbmR1Y3RvcnMvU2Ftc3VuZy1hbmQtVFNNQy10by1wYXJ0aWNpcGF0ZS1pbi1jaGlwLXNob3J0YWdlLXN1bW1pdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung and TSMC to participate in chip shortage summit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Almost 20 major companies worried about a global semiconductor chip shortage that has roiled the automotive industry will send senior executives to a White House summit Monday a senior official said on Friday.

The National Electronics and Cryptology Research Institute (UEKAE) is attempting to develop the components at its Semiconductor Technologies Research Laboratory (YITAL) in the Gebze district of the northwestern industrial province of Kocaeli.

The UEKAE is part of the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBITAK) Informatics and Information Security Research Center (BILGEM).

A significant portion of the chip needs of Turkish companies including Roketsan Aselsan and TÜBITAK Defense Industries Research and Development Institute (SAGE) are met at the center.

YITAL executive Aziz Ulvi Çalışkan said they have the competence to manufacture components for the country’s first homegrown car developed by Turkey’s Automobile Joint Venture Group (TOGG) a consortium manufacturing the car.

“We are in preparation for this we will be knocking on their door soon” Çalışkan told Turkish daily Sabah.

Turkey is among the few countries that design and produce all components of information security from the algorithm to the chip said UEKAE Manager Erdal Bayram.

The recent chip shortage plaguing global automakers has forced many to halt production and there does not seem to be an immediate solution.

Three Turkish carmakers Ford Otosan Tofaş and Oyak Renault recently had to temporarily suspend their production due to the chip supply crisis.

The shortage has forced production cuts worldwide and sparked worries across the industry including at Volkswagen Ford General Motors Honda Hyundai and Toyota prompting countries to ramp up efforts to resolve the shortage.

The spread of COVID-19 has scrambled supply and demand patterns worldwide and as a consequence caused a chip shortage.

Erdal says that they are confident they have the ability to adapt the production of microchips for the defense industry to other sectors including the automotive industry.

Çalışkan said it is possible for the domestically-developed chips to be used in TOGG.

“In the automobile industry there is a power control system that transfers power from the battery to the wheels. These are critical materials. We have important solutions and we have the necessary technology” he said.

Preparations are underway he says. “TOGG also needs to turn to us tell us their needs and shape us.”

“We manufacture according to order. It could be the same for TOGG” Çalışkan said.

The TOGG was formed in June 2018 by five industrial giants – the Anadolu Group BMC Kök Group Turkcell and Zorlu Holding – as well as an umbrella organization the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB) to produce the country’s first domestically manufactured electric vehicle (EV).

The consortium will produce five different models – an SUV sedan C-hatchback B-SUV and B-MPV – by 2030.

The country in December 2019 unveiled prototypes of an SUV and a sedan both fully electric and C-segment models. Mass production of the SUV will begin in 2022 with the sedan to follow."

The stock of PACCAR (NAS:PCAR 30-year Financials) is estimated to be significantly overvalued according to GuruFocus Value calculation. GuruFocus Value is GuruFocus' estimate of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. It is calculated based on the historical multiples that the stock has traded at the past business growth and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand if it is significantly below the GF Value Line its future return will likely be higher. At its current price of $93.36 per share and the market cap of $32.4 billion PACCAR stock shows every sign of being significantly overvalued. GF Value for PACCAR is shown in the chart below.

Investing in companies with poor financial strength has a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Thus it is important to carefully review the financial strength of a company before deciding whether to buy its stock. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is a great starting point for understanding the financial strength of a company. PACCAR has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.46 which is in the middle range of the companies in the industry of Farm & Heavy Construction Machinery. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of PACCAR at 5 out of 10 which indicates that the financial strength of PACCAR is fair. This is the debt and cash of PACCAR over the past years:

PACCAR Stock Appears To Be Significantly Overvalued

One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of PACCAR is -0.7% which ranks worse than 67% of the companies in the industry of Farm & Heavy Construction Machinery. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is -6% which ranks worse than 71% of the companies in the industry of Farm & Heavy Construction Machinery.

Another way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months PACCAR's ROIC was 6.39 while its WACC came in at 5.60. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of PACCAR is shown below:

PACCAR Stock Appears To Be Significantly Overvalued

To conclude the stock of PACCAR (NAS:PCAR 30-year Financials) gives every indication of being significantly overvalued. The company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is fair. Its growth ranks worse than 71% of the companies in the industry of Farm & Heavy Construction Machinery. To learn more about PACCAR stock you can check out its 30-year Financials here.

Oak Brook April 10 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Yue Zheng a 13-year-old girl from Dalian China has a vision of what peace looks like. Zheng brought that vision to life through her art earning her the grand prize in the Lions Clubs International Peace Poster Contest.

Zheng was one of 600000 participants worldwide in the annual Peace Poster Contest sponsored by local Lions clubs which gives young people aged 11-13 an opportunity to share their vision of world peace through art.

“When it came to my designing my artwork I first thought about how to represent “service” and “peace” said Zheng. “In my poster I show how people from different countries different age groups along with artificial intelligence would create a dove of peace together through the format of building with building blocks. The dove of peace opens its wings and flies towards the sky hoping that everyone can get along harmoniously and providing all kinds of services together to achieve peace.”

The winning poster was selected for its originality artistic merit and portrayal of the contest theme “Peace Through Service.” The Dalian De Long Lions Club sponsored the local contest that gave Zheng the opportunity to participate in this global event and share her vision with the world.

“I want my poster to show that everyone is the participant of peaceful services” said Zheng “Please reach out your selfless hands and let us build and create peace through services and spread peace and joy to every corner of the world.”

As the contest winner Zheng will receive a US$5000 cash prize. Zheng is also sharing in the celebration with 23 merit winners from around the world. All merit winners receive a US$500 cash prize for their winning artwork.

Should You?,"It’s happening.

The acceptance of digital currencies as a form of payment expanded greatly last week foreshadowing the increasingly important role cryptos such as Bitcoin and Ether will play in our lives going forward.

Both Visa and PayPal announced they will begin allowing the use of cryptocurrencies to settle transactions. This came a week after Tesla said it will now accept Bitcoin as a method of payment and a month after Mastercard signaled it would start supporting cryptos sometime this year.

PayPal’s Checkout with Crypto made available to select U.S. users last Wednesday gives consumers the ability to purchase goods and services at as many as 29 million merchants using Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash Ether or Litecoin.

What’s more there’s no additional transaction fee.

Founded in 1998 by Peter Thiel and Elon Musk among others PayPal has become a trusted household name. 2020 was a record year for the online payment service as people were stuck at home and companies digitized their operations. Total payment volume was a massive $277 billion a 39% increase from the previous year while the platform added 16 million new accounts for a total of 377 million registered accounts.

Very soon every one of these users will be able to use popular digital currencies to buy nearly everything from a cup of coffee to a new car. This represents a huge leap forward for the still-emerging technology.

Meanwhile Visa announced that it became the first payment processing company to settle a transaction with USD Coin (USDC) an open-source stablecoin backed by the U.S. dollar. According to the coin’s website USDC “is issued by regulated financial institutions backed by fully reserved assets” and “redeemable on a 1:1 basis for U.S. dollars.” As of March 28 there were 11.3 billion USDC in circulation.

Not only will Visa users be able to make purchases with USDC but Visa said it would also one day support new central bank digital currencies (CBDC) as they become available. According to the company some 80% of central banks are strongly considering or in the process of launching their own national digital currency.

Mastercard is reportedly doing the same announcing in February that it’s engaging with “several major central banks around the world” as they develop CBDCs. At the moment there’s no word on when Mastercard customers can expect to start paying with cryptos or even which cryptos will be supported but it seems likely we’ll hear something soon now that Visa has taken the first step.

Tesla Now Accepting Bitcoin

Currently the sixth largest U.S. company by market cap having surpassed Visa and Berkshire Hathaway Tesla has been ramping up its accumulation of Bitcoin.Those of you in the market for a Tesla may have noticed that you can already select Bitcoin at checkout only a week after Elon Musk tweeted the news.

If you recall the company disclosed that it bought $1.5 billion worth of the digital currency as part of a corporate policy that allows the electric vehicle (EV) maker to invest in alternative reserve assets including not just cryptocurrencies but also gold bullion and gold ETFs.

Musk often tweets about cryptos to his nearly 50 million Twitter followers which can trigger incredible price swings. Dogecoin surged more than 1000% from $0.007 to $0.080 in as little as 12 days in January and February after the Tesla “Technoking” tweeted about it.

Someone recently developed a bot in fact that automatically buys Bitcoin whenever Musk mentions it in a tweet. This reminds me of the Trump & Dump Bot which used artificial intelligence (AI) to identify publicly traded companies whenever they appeared in one of the former president’s tweets. The bot then shorted the stock and donated the proceeds to charity. Trump’s Twitter account was permanently suspended on January 8.

Gold Off to Its Worst Start in Almost 40 Years. Buy the Dip?

The price of Bitcoin has more than doubled so far this year and on Friday cracked the $60000 resistance level in intraday trading. Ether meanwhile is up more than 180% for the year after hitting a new record high last week.

Not every inflation hedge has been a winner though. Gold is having its worst start to the year since 1982 losing close to 12% for the three-month period even as concerns over inflation are intensifying.

Since touching its all-time high of around $2070 per ounce at the beginning of last August gold has been under pressure from steadily rising bond yields. The yield on the 10-year Treasury is currently trading above 1.7% as investors dump bonds in favor of risk assets. Bond yields rise as prices fall. The U.S. Dollar Index meanwhile rose above 93 last week which also dampened the yellow metal’s appeal.

I think it’s important to point out that gold’s investment case right now remains as strong as ever and investors would be wise to consider using this price dip as a buying opportunity. Money-printing remains at a record clip and the debt continues to be piled on. Last Wednesday President Joe Biden outlined his $2 trillion package to rebuild U.S. infrastructure a plan that will reportedly be paid for over time with tax hikes on corporations and wealthy Americans. This legislation if passed would follow the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package signed into law last month.

No Inflation? Home Prices Surge the Most in 15 Years

More economic data was released last week suggesting that inflation is running a lot hotter than what the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is reporting. Home prices in the U.S. rose 11.2% year-over-year in January marking the fastest rate since February 2006. The median price for a new single-family home in the U.S. increased to $336000 in 2020 up from $321500 a year earlier according to Census Bureau data.

At issue is rising commodity prices particularly lumber which has stalled construction of new homes. According to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) soaring lumber costs have added more than $24000 to the price of a new home.

As a result only a little over 1 million new and existing homes were available for sale in the U.S. in February the lowest level ever in data going back to 1982 the National Association of Realtors (NAR) says.

Homeownership has historically been one of the key ways Americans build wealth. But with prices on the rise buying a home may be out of reach for many families.

The good news is that Americans appear to be getting back to work. In March the U.S. economy added 916000 jobs the most since August. The industry with the biggest share of new jobs was leisure and hospitality which might not seem positive at first glance since such positions tend to be low-paying. However I see it as a further positive sign that the economy is opening back up and Americans are getting back to life before the pandemic.

View the current offers here.

One constant of the pandemic has been a never-ending news stream from the wonderful world of Disney.

Parks closing parks re-opening (basically before any other travel or attraction) changes in the guest/park experience and now how the parks will deal with the pent-up demand of Disneyholics. It may sound crazy to head to a busy theme park in a pandemic but thanks to Disney's rules and procedures it's actually a pretty solid choice.

With my vaccinations complete I'm again headed to Orlando this July to meet a couple of other families for some solid Disney exploration and adventure. A trip to Disney World can easily cost thousands of dollars and can be a difficult trip to complete in its entirety on points and miles especially if you like to stay on Disney property.

But I love a good challenge. So here is a recap of how I'm covering the cost of travel tickets and food at Disney World using just my credit card reward points and perks.

Capital One Venture Miles for tickets and campsite

There are very few good options to get great value out of your points and miles for Disney tickets but Capital One Venture Miles from my Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card (currently available with a large limited-time welcome bonus) is a rare example where you can get the desired value out of your rewards.

With Capital One's ability to redeem miles to essentially wipe out travel charges you make to the card you can use Venture Miles to cover any travel expense charged to the card at a rate of one cent per mile. Since you earn 2x Venture Miles on all purchases this is equivalent to using a 2% cashback card to cover your Disney expenses.

For lodging I'll again be driving my RV down to Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground.

We stayed for a week last fall and found the campground to be such a fun Disney experience. It also happens to be the most affordable on-property location though still quite expensive as far as campgrounds go. The campground will cost me about $350 for three nights requiring me to use 35000 Venture Miles to erase the charge.

When it comes to park tickets there is one important note to make here: Disney tickets purchased directly from Disney by themselves do not count as travel and therefore cannot be erased. (They usually do when purchased as part of a larger lodging and ticket package.)

However Disney tickets bought from UndercoverTourist.com do traditionally count as a travel charge and you'll be able to erase the purchase with your Venture Miles.

For my dates this summer the three-day Disney Theme Park Base Ticket will cost $378.91 requiring me to redeem 37 891 Venture Miles to erase the charge. This puts the cost of my lodging and ticket at around 72000 Venture Miles and $0 out of pocket.

The Venture Rewards card currently comes with its highest-ever sign-up bonus: 100000 bonus miles after spending $20000 on the card within the first 12 months of account opening. This is awarded in two installments.

First you can still earn 50000 miles after you spend $3000 in purchases within the first three months of account opening. The second set of 50000 miles is awarded with a total of $20000 in spending in the first year on the card.

I recently picked up the Capital One Venture Rewards card for both my wife and me meaning with 200000 welcome bonus miles plus the miles earned to meet the minimum spend I'm happy redeeming 70000 of them to help make Disney free as far as my wallet is concerned.

Amex Platinum PayPal credits for Disney gift cards

At the start of January 2021 American Express unveiled a new temporary perk for The Platinum Card® from American Express cardmembers: an up to $30 monthly PayPal statement credit. Amex has automatically issued these monthly statement credits for eligible PayPal purchases that I've charged each month.

When I first heard about the PayPal credit I immediately thought of one of my favorite discount gift card websites that I know accepts PayPal: cardcash.com.

While I typically buy discounted gift cards from the site they also sell new gift cards for just about any amount including brand-new Disney gift cards you can order for exactly $30.

When you select checkout with PayPal a pop-up window will show you your linked cards including your personal Platinum Card from American Express which specifically tells you about the PayPal credit right on the pop-up:

Both my wife and I carry a personal Amex Platinum card and this is how I've been using each of our monthly credits.

With $60 in free-to-me Disney gift cards coming in every month by my July trip I'll have $360 in Disney gift cards saved up to cover food drinks and anything else I want to buy in the parks and on property.

Gas programs for free gas

I've written a couple of times about the self-admitted obsession I have with either not paying for gas or at the very least not paying anywhere close to full price for gas.

Whenever I have an RV trip coming up I begin to strategize about a month out how to earn enough credits in a variety of programs to cover the diesel I'll need to buy for the nine-hour drive to and from Orlando from my home in the Atlanta area.

Fuel Rewards GetUpside TruNow Pay with Gas Buddy Marathon's Make-it-Count Kroger Fuel Points and some targeted Amex offers can all make it incredibly cheap or free (depending on what promotions are occurring) for my summer drive to Orlando.

Bottom line

Through a combination of using Venture Miles earned from a sign-up bonus free Disney gift cards thanks to a new Amex Platinum monthly perk and a variety of programs that let you save on gas I should have my summer jaunt to Disney World be entirely free when it comes to cash required from my wallet.

There may likely be some unexpected cost of an RV part repair or something else unforeseen but as it stands I'm pleased with the different redemptions and strategy I have planned to cover my travel lodging tickets and food. Disney is always fun but it's that much more fun when the cost to me is $0.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vc3Vucy9zdW5zLWFubm91bmNlLXJvYWQtZ2FtZS1yYWxsaWVzLXBob2VuaXgtc3Vucy1hcmVuYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SUNS ANNOUNCE ROAD GAME RALLIES AT PHOENIX SUNS ARENA,"4.19 Phoenix Suns at Milwaukee Bucks | 4.22 Phoenix Suns at Boston Celtics

PepsiCo is also rolling out a line-up of “breakfast pouches” in the UK to meet what the group said is increasing demand for “convenient on-the-go breakfast options”.

The Quaker Oat & Fruit Breakfast containing oats fruit purée and natural yogurt in 200g pouches “offers a complete breakfast solution” Quaker said.

The new products which will initially be available in Tesco stores only are available in three flavours – red fruits; apple and cinnamon; and blueberry – “each of which provides a source of fibre and contains no added sugar”.

Duncan McKay senior marketing manager of PepsiCo’s grains business in the UK said: “Quaker Oats has been instrumental in driving growth in the hot cereals category by 65% with sales doubling over the last seven years and this year will be no different. We have listened to consumers and we are responding to their needs with a whole raft of new product development initiatives all of which are designed to inject growth into the category.”

McKay said: “We are particularly excited by the launch of our new breakfast pouch range as demand for convenient on-the-go breakfast options is at a peak.”

The new products follow the launch of Quaker’s Super Goodness range in the UK in July designed to provide what PepsiCo said were “enhanced nutritional qualities”.

In March PepsiCo launched Quaker Breakfast Flats breakfast biscuits in the UK which it said spoke to local demand for “nutritious and convenient morning snacks”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vY29uc3VtZXJicmFuZHNhc3NvY2lhdGlvbi5vcmcvYmxvZy9tYWtpbmctYS1jb21taXRtZW50LXRvLWFtZXJpY2FzLXJlY3ljbGluZy1mdXR1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Making a Commitment to America’s Recycling Future,"Updated April 11 2021

I went into sustainability — like every wide-eyed hopeful starting in the field — to save the world. After more than 15 years I’m still hopeful but more aware than ever of the magnitude of the challenge before us.

Working on behalf of consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies I know how committed the industry is to sustainability. I also know recycling and waste are major concerns for consumers especially when packaging doesn’t end up where it should.

Every CPG company I’ve encountered focuses on sustainability. All of the 25-largest CPG companies have made commitments to increasing recyclable content minimizing packaging or reusing material. Eighty percent of them are working toward fully recyclable packaging for all products by 2030 — at the latest.

All of the 25-largest CPG companies have made commitments to increasing recyclable content minimizing packaging or reusing material.

The industry is also driving innovation from developing shampoo bottles made from beach plastic to investing in zero-interest loans for cities to upgrade their recycling infrastructure. While a start these efforts alone won’t be enough.

Our recycling system needs major improvement and everyone must play a role. Tackling this problem requires three simple but significant actions.

1. Innovate for the long-term.

One-off solutions won’t fix the problem. Even materials consumers perceive as more environmentally friendly present challenges. Glass for example is recyclable but hard to handle – it breaks and is heavy requiring more fuel to transport. Such complications show why we must think holistically about packaging innovations.

The CPG industry is investing in packaging design and product distribution innovation. In a new initiative called Loop Clorox P&G PepsiCo and Unilever are among the 25 companies partnering with the recycling company TerraCycle to pilot a new sustainable packaging model that delivers products in reusable containers to consumers. PepsiCo piloted its Tropicana orange juice in refillable glass bottles and lines of its Quaker cereal in stainless steel containers that are picked up after consumption cleaned and refilled. P&G will offer Pantene shampoo products in aluminum bottles and Tide detergent in stainless steel.

2. Be “all-in” on recycling.

Even as Americans have improved their recycling we still throw out 22 million tons of recyclables each year. According to the EPA Americans recycle just nine percent of plastic 26 percent of glass and 34 percent of metal.

The first step is getting recyclables in the bin — but it’s also about getting them there the right way. Thousands of recycling programs use dramatically different technology. Some deploy optical sorters magnets and fans to sort by weight and material type. Others use workers to hand-pick higher value material from a conveyor belt. The result? What’s recyclable in one town is prohibited in the next.

Confusion creates contaminated items that can’t be recycled but end up in the recycling stream. Contamination rates are rising from seven percent 10 years ago to 25 percent today.

Contamination became an even bigger problem last year when China the biggest buyer of our recyclables limited contaminants to no more than 0.5 percent — a level our system cannot reasonably meet. Accordingly mixed paper and plastic exports to China plunged more than 90 percent from 2017 to 2018 exacerbating the American recycling problem.

3. Create a system that supports recycling.

Following China’s policy change recycled material’s value plummeted as U.S. recycling programs lost their biggest market. What some local programs used to sell for a profit they now pay to get rid of. This dramatic shift forced hundreds of programs to reduce or suspend recycling efforts.

The recycling system has many failure points. If consumers don’t recycle CPG companies can’t reuse material. If companies only design packaging to protect the product and not with the full lifecycle in mind we wind up with packaging that can’t be recycled or recovered. If local systems aren’t using best practices and educating residents participation rates fall and municipalities struggle to afford recycling programs.

Today the attitude on recycling is “why wouldn’t we?” But it could easily shift to “why bother?” We need to come together support what works and drive innovation at every level of the process.

The CPG industry is making real investments to increase sustainability but it is one part of the equation. We need the parts of the whole to come together to enact meaningful change to our recycling system — change we desperately need. If we can do that every wide-eyed hopeful that comes after me will know what’s possible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZ3JhemlhZGFpbHkuY28udWsvbGlmZS9pbi10aGUtbmV3cy9leC1wZXBzaS1jZW8taW5kcmEtbm9veWktY2hpbGRjYXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indra Nooyi: How Even One Of The World's Most Powerful Women Struggled With Childcare,"Earlier this month after more than 112000 people signed our petition asking for childcare reform Grazia’s call for an independent review of the UK’s childcare system reached Westminster. MPs such as Stella Creasy who attended with her baby spoke in support of our campaign run with our parenting platform The Juggle and Pregnant Then Screwed.

‘That’s a campaign people in the UK should back’ says Indra Nooyi one of the world’s most powerful female business leaders. Affordable high-quality childcare is essential she says because ‘for a country to be successful and prosper anyone who wants to engage in paid work should have the opportunity to do so.’

Indra 65 knows a thing or two about juggling parenthood and a career. Her own ascent detailed in her new memoir was dizzying. Born in 1955 in Madras (now Chennai) South India by 2006 she had become the first woman immigrant and person of colour to run a Fortune 50 company as CEO of PepsiCo.

My Life In Full: Work Family And Our Future blends tales of White House dinners and activist investors with moments of mum guilt. ‘There is no work-life balance’ she says. ‘Call it work-life juggling.’ It also explains how her equal partnership of 41 years with husband Raj is at the heart of her accomplishments and details the patchwork childcare set-ups created over the years from relying on her mother and other relatives to babysitters and nannies.

Indra wrote the book after being asked ‘by so many women how did I do it? Can they do it too? Is there a manual? When I joined PepsiCo I was one of 11 female CEOs running a Fortune 500 company. Now there are about 40 out of 500 which is still only about 10% even though 70% of valedictorians [top-ranking high-school graduates] are female. I kept saying to myself “Why aren’t all of these brilliant hardworking driven women making it to the top in larger numbers?”’

Better care infrastructure is a huge part of this puzzle she believes – that’s why she has pledged to devote herself to the issue after leaving PepsiCo in 2019. And she has the profile to do so: the opening chapter captures Indra in conversation with Barack Obama then US President and Manmohan Singh then Indian Prime Minister. ‘The time has come to bring those discussions to the centre of the room with people in power’ she says. ‘Many times when I was in the room with all of the powerful people I watched discussions on the future of work but no discussion about families and how women are a critical part of our future.’",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFzY2llbmNlY2VudHJhbC5jb20vYW4tb3ZlcnZpZXctb2YtYXVnbWVudGVkLXJlYWxpdHktYXBwbGljYXRpb25zLWFuZC10aGVpci1mdXR1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An overview of Augmented reality applications and their future impact on AI - DataScienceCentral.com,"Application Category Notes

He is talking about the giant American drugmaker’s speedy development (with BioNTech of Germany) of a vaccine against covid-19. The sentiment also applies to the turnaround in the fortunes of the pharmaceutical industry.

Before the pandemic Big Pharma was in big trouble. It was widely criticised for investing more in marketing than in research for pursuing “me too” drugs over novel therapies and for alleged price-gouging. When Gallup a pollster asked Americans in 2019 to rank two dozen big industries by favourability the drugs business came in last. That year its bosses were subjected to a Big Tobacco-style bipartisan hazing in Congress which threatened price controls. Concerns over diminishing research gains and returns weighed on drugmakers’ share prices (see chart).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2FuLXZhcmlhbnQtY2FuLWJyZWFrLXRocm91Z2gtcGZpemVyLXZhY2NpbmUtaXNyYWVsaS1zdHVkeS1zYXlzLTIwMjEtMDQtMTAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,South African variant may evade protection from Pfizer vaccine Israeli study says,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/south-african-variant-can-break-through-pfizer-vaccine-israeli-study-says-2021-04-10/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2FuLXZhcmlhbnQtY2FuLWJyZWFrLXRocm91Z2gtcGZpemVyLXZhY2NpbmUtaXNyYWVsaS1zdHVkeS1zYXlzLTIwMjEtMDQtMTAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNtb2luZXNyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9oZWFsdGgvMjAyMS8wNC8xMC9jb3ZpZC12YWNjaW5lLWlvd2Etd2hhdC1rbm93LXZhY2NpbmF0ZWQtaW1tdW5pdHktdHJhdmVsLXNhZmV0eS1wZml6ZXItbW9kZXJuYS1qb2huc29uLWpvaG5zb24vNzE1NTczNTAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Should vaccinated Iowans wear a mask and what's safe to do?,"More than a million Iowans have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

Thousands more have received the first shot in a two-dose vaccine regimen. The vaccines produced by Moderna and Pfizer both require a second dose to reach full effectiveness.

So what changes for fully vaccinated Iowans?

What does the COVID-19 vaccine protect me against? How effective are they?

The major takeaway for all three vaccines available in the United States: They are all ""pretty close to 100%"" effective at preventing the inoculated from becoming severely ill with COVID-19 said Dr. Dan Diekema director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.

Additionally they're about 90% to 95% effective at preventing people from even developing symptoms of the disease he said. They also appear highly effective at preventing illness from the coronavirus variants cropping up around the world and in Iowa though scientists are still studying it for conclusive results.

Scientists are still gathering data about how effective the vaccines are at preventing virus transmission. But early results are promising showing they are 70% to 90% effective at stopping the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

""They're extremely extremely good at protecting the person who received the vaccine but not 100%"" Diekema said in an interview.

But he added we still have to be mindful that the majority of the population has not yet been vaccinated and that many people have conditions that suppress their immune systems potentially diminishing the effectiveness of the vaccine in them.

In response to a Register reader question about immune systems naturally weakening with age Diekema said in an email that vaccine effectiveness is high enough that CDC guidance still applies to older Iowans.

""Even though the immune system does weaken with age the current vaccines remain highly effective at preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19 in older adults (including over 75)"" Diekema wrote.

I'm fully vaccinated. Can life return to normal for me?

Update on May 14:New guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a mask or physically distance in most circumstances. However it advises to continue wearing masks in accordance with state local or business regulations. They can also refrain from routine testing for infection such as due to travel or exposure to an infected person. If they develop COVID symptoms vaccinated people should still seek tests and medical guidance.

Medical professions consider a person fully vaccinated two weeks after completing the vaccine series. That means waiting for two weeks after a person receives the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine or two weeks after they receive their booster shot of Moderna or Pfizer.

But a pandemic is a population-level disaster and Diekema urges people to think of their community when making their decisions. That means you should continue to wear a mask and keep your distance from others in public out of an abundance of caution in case you're carrying the virus but feeling no symptoms as an example. Plus your behavior reinforces the society-wide effort needed to minimize spread of a potentially fatal disease he said.

""Your vaccine is your protection but all the other (mitigation efforts) are population-based community interventions that we all need to continue to adhere to just for a little bit longer until everyone's had a chance to be vaccinated and we're out of this"" Diekema said.

He said he is still watching overall infection rates to gauge virus activity. Those numbers should guide the use of mitigation efforts and the return to normalcy he said. Once vaccinations are more prevalent the infection rate should naturally come down.

That said fully vaccinated Iowans can feel more comfortable doing things they may have been avoiding before he said.

Is it safe to eat indoors at restaurants? What about exercising at the gym or travel?

According to official guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention people who have been fully vaccinated can feel comfortable doing the following:

Visit with other fully vaccinated people — or with unvaccinated people who are not at risk for severe illness — in close quarters without needing a mask.

Travel domestically without pre- or post-travel coronavirus tests and without needing to quarantine afterward

Gather or conduct activities outdoors without wearing a mask except in certain crowded settings and venues. (Added April 27)

Iowa Department of Public Health interim Director Kelly Garcia is deferring to the same guidance for Iowans.

Diekema said he expects the CDC guidance to expand in coming weeks and months to explicitly allow more activities for vaccinated people.

In the meantime Diekema said fully vaccinated people who are otherwise healthy should feel comfortable dining indoors.

They can feel comfortable huffing-and-puffing in an indoor gym as well — though he still recommends people keep their distance and wear a mask while doing so. The mask will keep fully vaccinated people from spreading virus through the air if they are infected.

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds: 'I strongly oppose vaccine passports' will take steps to limit their use

It's been two weeks since my first dose of Moderna or Pfizer. Can I tip-toe back to normalcy?

Even a single dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines confers a degree of protection from COVID-19 an interim CDC study published April 2 showed. But Diekema still encourages people to wait for their second shot before tiptoeing back into pre-pandemic habits.

""The second dose does seem to be quite important"" Diekema said acknowledging that there are varying opinions about it. ""... When we look at antibody levels after dose one and after dose two and immune response after dose two it really does seem to be important to generating the high level of protection that you get after full vaccination.""

He recommended all Iowans who are eligible get vaccinated as soon as they're able.

HOUSTON — Pfizer hopes its COVID-19 vaccine will be available to some children in time for the next school year.

Pfizer announced it submitted clinical trial data for adolescents 12 to 15 years old to the FDA for emergency use authorization. The drugmaker says its COVID-19 vaccine is 100% effective in preventing all symptoms of the virus after completing a clinical trial with 2300 adolescent participants.

While many see the shot as a way to get students safely back in the classroom others wonder why they need a vaccine if most kids show mild or no symptoms.

“That’s probably the biggest concern that everyone is expressing not only parents but people involved in the trials” said Dr. Michael Chang a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at UTHealth.

Chang said most children aren’t seriously affected by the coronavirus but some are. In rare cases older teenagers have been hospitalized with MIS-C.

The CDC has been monitoring clusters of cases across the country centered around youth sports.

“When you look into the details of these outbreaks it’s not necessarily the on-field activities. It’s in the locker room warming up where you’re less likely to have your mask but you’re still indoors and in close proximity” Chang said.

Chang said getting kids immunized protects them and everyone they come in contact with.

“Each person who is infected is someone who can spread it to someone else. Each person who is infected is someone who could be really ill” he said.

When Pfizer submitted for emergency-use authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine for adults it took about a month for the FDA to grant the authorization. Chang says the FDA advisory committee may ask for more safety data this time around since it involves pediatric patients.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvaG93LW11Y2gtdGltZS1zaG91bGQteW91LXdhaXQtYmVmb3JlLXNlY29uZC1jb3ZpZC12YWNjaW5lLWRvc2UvMjQ4MzA3OS_SAXNodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNjaGljYWdvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2hvdy1tdWNoLXRpbWUtc2hvdWxkLXlvdS13YWl0LWJlZm9yZS1zZWNvbmQtY292aWQtdmFjY2luZS1kb3NlLzI0ODMwNzkvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Much Time Should You Wait Before Second COVID Vaccine Dose?,"While planning when to receive the COVID-19 vaccine remember Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots require different lengths of time between doses.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention second shots should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible but can be given up to 42 days after the first dose if necessary.

Here's when to receive the second dose:

The second Pfizer dose should be given 21 days after your first dose

The second Moderna vaccine dose should be given 28 days later

Though the CDC says second doses should not be administered earlier than the recommended interval those given ""within a grace period of 4 days earlier than the recommended date for the second dose are still considered valid.""

Health care providers will likely schedule the second vaccine dose during the first dose appointment typically with the option of picking another location if necessary.

A new CDC study reported that a single dose of Pfizer's or Moderna's COVID vaccine was 80% effective in preventing infections. That number jumped to 90% two weeks after the second dose the study on vaccinated health care workers showed.

Complete vaccination is said to be two weeks after a person receives their second dose of the two-shot Pfizer and Moderna vaccines according to health officials.

If side effects persist after either dose of the vaccine the CDC recommends people take over-the-counter medicines like ibuprofen acetaminophen aspirin or antihistamines after speaking with a doctor.

Feeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter here.

The CDC does not recommend however that people take such over-the-counter medications or antihistamines to prevent side effects prior to receiving the coronavirus vaccine.

Health officials noted that it is not known how those medications might affect the efficacy of the vaccine. For people who take medications for underlying medical conditions the CDC recommends to continue taking."

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXJpem9uYXNwb3J0cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMzU0NzMwMi9mb3JtZXItYXJpem9uYS1wZy10LWotbWNjb25uZWxsLWNvbnRpbnVlcy1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLWluLW5iYS1mb3ItcGFjZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Arizona PG T.J. McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

The government is set to collect over Sh12 billion annually in tax from a newly launched cigarette manufacturing firm Phillip Morris Tanzania.

Speaking at the launch of the factory in Morogoro Municipality the executive director of Mansoor Industries (firm operator) Mr Sharif Mansoor yesterday revealed that the revenue would come from the factory’s installed capacity of producing over 1 billion cigarettes per year. The televised event was graced by President John Magufuli other top government officials Industry Trade and Investment minister Charles Mwijage and Morogoro regional commissioner Steven Kebwe.

“To begin with we’re eyeing the local market before venturing into the international market in future” said Mr Mansoor.

“I also commend the government for its efforts to curb corruption. I can testify that state-run institutions like Tanzania Bureau of Standard have improved in accountability. It took us just fifteen working days to secure permits for selling our products” he added. The cigarette firm an affiliate of Philip Morris International (PMI) previously signed manufacturing agreement with Mansoor Industries for cigarette making to cater for both the local and international markets.

Mr Mansoor who is also Kwimba’s Member of Parliament further revealed that the completion of the cigarette factory will create at least 224 direct jobs to Tanzanians.

For his part President Magufuli expressed his optimism that the newly launched firm would benefit tobacco growers in the region to access reliable market by selling raw materials to the firm.

He further assured the partners of his government’s commitment to create favourable environment with a focus to ensure development projects succeeded.

“I urge the relevant government authorities to show support to investors and provide them with some requisite incentives with the view to continue attracting as many international investors as possible” he said.

He also said he would set up an official tour in the region to survey and assess further implementation of other development projects implemented by development partners in collaboration with stated-owned institutions.

At same occasion Ms Dagmar Bursikova a representative of the Phillip Morris International Ltd (investor) revealed that the firm had invested a total of Sh65 billion to implement the project. “Establishment of this firm in Morogoro justifies our long-term vision and commitment to invest on Tanzanian soil. I commend the government for creating conducive environment for investors. We are looking forward to increasing our investment in other key sectors” she said.

“We are determined to produce high quality products and complement the government in achieving its desired middle income status by 2025 through industrialisation” she added.

For his part Dr Kebwe assured the President of his office’s commitment to closely partner with investors in establishing small medium and large scale industries in the region with the view of complementing the government’s drive to achieve the middle-income vision.

He further revealed that the region had so far established over 3000 small medium and large industries citing that his office in collaboration with partners was eying to embark on constructing more industries.

Commenting on agriculture Dr Kebwe revealed that the region required over 6000 tonnes of Urea fertilizer citing that farmers were experiencing critical shortages.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVjaXRpemVuLmNvLnR6L3RhbnphbmlhL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwvd29ybGQtYW5ub3VuY2VzLTEwLXBvaW50LWRlY2xhcmF0aW9ucy1hZ2FpbnN0LXRvYmFjY28tYXBwb2ludHMtd29tYW4tcHJlc2lkZW50LTI2MjYwODTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,World announces 10-point declarations against tobacco appoints woman president,"Cape Town. The 17th World Conference on Tobacco or Health (WCTOH) has come up with ten declarations as it went on to announce the tobacco epidemic as the biggest public health threat that the world has ever faced.

This was revealed in Cape Town South Africa where anti-tobacco stakeholders called for equity in tobacco control leadership as the WCTOH announced Dr Flavia Senkubuge – the first black woman to be president of the global forum.

In a statement released at the end of the conference on Friday WCTOH called for gender and sex to be incorporated into research as standard and for greater implementation of the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).

The statement outlined ten declarations that anti-tobacco campaigners have come up with in the effort to end tobacco consumption around the world.

“Tobacco use kills more than 7 million people each year and the vast majority of these deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries’’ said the statement.

The global economic cost of smoking amounts to nearly 2 trillion dollars and 2 percent of the worlds GDP in 2016 it added.

“Tobacco use also undermines sustainable development imposing a huge burden on the global economy exacerbating poverty contributing to food insecurity and harming the environment’’ it pointed out.

However the WCTOH is concerned that there is an irreconcilable conflict between the manufacture and marketing of tobacco products and the right to health.

“The tobacco industry is a driver of poverty and linked to child labor violation of workers’ rights food insecurity and exploitation of farmers. African governments need to take concrete and urgent action to implement alternative livelihoods that are the rich sources of income free from tobacco it noted.

Thus the stakeholders unanimously declared to call on governments to unite with civil society to stop tobacco industry interference and accelerate implementation of the WHO FCTC using a whole of government approach.

They also urged governments scientists research entities foundations and civil society organizations to reject or cease engagement with the Philip Morris International-funded Foundation for a Smokefree World and other initiatives of the tobacco industry

In doing so they adopted the Cape Town Declaration on Human Rights and a Tobacco-free World. “We call on African governments to operationalize the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development that recommends increasing tobacco taxes as an untapped sustainable domestic resource mobilization strategy for accelerating the implementation of the WHO FCTC in Africa’’ reads another declaration.

“We call on Parties to actively engage in the development of the WHO FCTC Medium Term Strategic Framework and Plan and to endorse them at the forthcoming eighth session of the Conference of the Parties of the WHO FCTC” said another declaration.

Then the WCTOH said it supports the concept of a tobacco free generation and commit to empowering youth involvement and advocacy as a means to achieving a tobacco free world.

Stakeholders called upon Finance Ministers to actively support the WCTOH 2018 Declarations by prioritizing sustainable funding for tobacco control and ceasing public and private investment in the tobacco industry.

They also called on governments to extend as a priority fiscal policies to continually decrease the affordability and accessibility of tobacco products

“We call on the Parties to the WHO FCTC to integrate gender based data collection and reporting into Party reports to the Conference of the Parties on their implementation of the WHO FCTC by COP9’’ they added.",,,,,,,,,

Jennie Baranczyk has been hired as the ninth head coach in University of Oklahoma women's basketball history. OU Vice President and Director of Athletics Joe Castiglione made the announcement Saturday.



Baranczyk (pronounced bah-RAHN-check) who has served as head coach at Drake the last nine seasons will be formally introduced this coming week at a press conference on the OU campus. She replaces Sherri Coale who retired last month after 25 seasons at the Sooners' helm.



""This is a truly exciting day for our university and athletics department as we welcome Jennie Baranczyk as our new head women's basketball coach"" said Castiglione. ""Her track record of overseeing creative and effective offenses and producing high win totals conference championships and postseason appearances during her time at Drake certainly appealed to our search committee as it evaluated the very competitive candidate pool. But her mastery of the head coaching role extends far beyond the court and it's clear that her personal and professional values align with ours.



""Jennie prioritizes the overall well-being of everyone in her program is passionate about empowering her student-athletes and recognizes that a program is only as good as its people. She is family-oriented and community-minded both of which will help her generate enthusiasm among our fans and as she works to return our program to Big 12 and national prominence. We are thrilled that she and her husband Scott and kids Eli Jordi and Hope have joined the OU family and we are so eager for their arrival in Norman.""



Baranczyk comes to OU after amassing a 192-96 (.667) record at Drake and leading the Bulldogs to six consecutive 20-win seasons (2014-15 through 2019-20) and to three NCAA tournament berths (2017-19). A two-time Missouri Valley Conference Coach of the Year Baranczyk's .667 winning percentage ranks fifth in the league's history.



Known for fostering high-powered offenses Baranczyk is coming off a 2020-21 season that saw Drake lead the nation's 336 teams in assists per game (20.4) and rank sixth in the country in field goal percentage (48.1%) 22nd in scoring offense (76.4 ppg) and 24th in 3-point field goal percentage (36.4%). The Bulldogs finished 18-12 overall and in second place in league play with a 13-5 record.



Baranczyk's teams have dominated the Missouri Valley over the last seven seasons. During that span Drake went 109-17 (.865) in regular season league play - good for the 10th-best conference winning percentage nationally - and finished no worse than second in the league standings each year. Its lowest MVC winning percentage during the stretch was .722 this past season.



Also over the past seven years Drake ranked second nationally in effective field goal percentage (.540) and 2-point field goal percentage (.549) third in assists per game (20.6) and sixth in scoring offense (80.1 ppg) and field goal percentage (.474). It is the only program in the country that has ranked in the top three nationally in assists per game in each of the last five seasons (averaged a nation-leading 21.5 per game during the stretch).



""We're thrilled to have Coach Baranczyk join the Sooner Nation"" said OU President Joseph Harroz Jr. ""Her enthusiastic coaching style fits perfectly in our culture and her track record of excellence will serve our student-athletes and our program well into the future. The Baranczyks will make a wonderful addition to our OU family.""



Baranczyk won back-to-back MVC Coach of the Year awards after her team's historic 2016-17 and 2017-18 campaigns leading the Bulldogs to an 18-0 regular season conference record both years and winning both MVC Tournaments. And after the 2018-19 squad posted a 17-1 league record the Bulldogs had amassed a near-perfect three-year MVC mark of 53-1 (.981).



Drake's 2016-17 team finished with a 28-5 record that included a school- and MVC-record 22-game winning streak. That season Baranczyk was named Mid-Major Coach of the Year by ESPNW.



""It is an honor and a privilege to be named the next head coach for the University of Oklahoma's women's basketball program and follow the highly successful and much-admired Sherri Coale"" said Baranczyk. ""My coaching philosophy is based upon the most powerful human emotion to me and that is love. The players who put on this jersey must love the game love to compete and love OU.



""We are going to compete at the highest level on the court and in the classroom. We will play hard play together and be fun to watch. I'm looking forward to being at Oklahoma where there are amazing people and where we can – and will – compete for championships.""



Under Baranczyk Drake spent multiple weeks ranked in the AP Top 25 poll in 2016-17 and 2018-19 seasons. In November 2018 the Bulldogs climbed as high as No. 24 to earn the program's highest ranking since 2001.



Three of Baranczyk's players combined to win five Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year awards and she produced 24 all-conference selections during her Drake tenure including a league-high 18 first-team honorees and a league-leading 38 MVC Player of the Week winners. In addition she coached four players to MVC Freshman of the Year honors as well as the program's first two MVC Defensive Player of the Year recipients in 2018 and 2019.



Baranczyk began her coaching career in the Big 12 Conference serving first as an assistant coach at Kansas State during the 2005-06 season (the Wildcats won the WNIT) and returning to the league as an assistant coach at Colorado from 2010-12.



Between her Big 12 stints Baranczyk served as an assistant coach at Marquette from 2006-10 helping the Golden Eagles to an 81-53 record and four postseason appearances. The 2007-08 squad won the WNIT title.



Formerly Jennie Lillis Baranczyk spent her collegiate career at the University of Iowa (2000-04) and is regarded as one of the best all-around players in Hawkeye women's basketball history. She was a three-time All-Big Ten Conference selection earning first-team honors as a junior (2003) and second-team recognition as a sophomore (2002) and senior (2004).



The Urbandale Iowa product led the Hawkeyes to four postseason appearances including three NCAA tournament berths as well as the 2001 Big Ten Tournament title. Baranczyk graduated as the only player in Iowa history ranked in the top 10 of five major statistical categories: points rebounds assists steals and blocks. Additionally she was one of only two Hawkeyes to score more than 1700 points and grab 800 rebounds in their career.



Baranczyk earned a bachelor's degree in communication studies from Iowa in 2004. She was the recipient of the 2004 Big Ten Conference's Medal of Honor the award given annually to a student in the graduating class of each university that demonstrated proficiency in scholarship and athletics. She was also a three-time Academic All-Big Ten honoree a WBCA Scholarship Award recipient a CoSIDA Academic All-District selection and a Collegiate Basketball Award for Excellence semifinalist as a senior in 2004.



Baranczyk who obtained a master's degree in counseling and student development from Kansas State in 2006 is married. She and her husband Scott have a son Eli and two daughters Jordi and Hope.

Blue Mountain the westernmost peak in the Maumelle Pinnacles chain lies near Rattlesnake Ridge and Pinnacle Mountain State Park.

The deal is not yet finalized with PotlatchDeltic a timberland real estate investment trust that owns the land where Blue Mountain sits. The commission has submitted grant proposals to the Division of Arkansas Heritage's Natural and Cultural Resources Council and the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund for a significant portion of its $4 million project share according to a news release.

The Nature Conservancy pledged to raise $1 million to help buy the property and at least another $1 million for long-term management of the property and the development of trails and other amenities. It has raised more than 75% of these funds already said Jen Barnhouse director of philanthropy.

""We want to keep it out of development and add it to the broader conservation and recreation landscape that's taking place out there"" she said. ""There's been a lot more demand and desire for outdoor spaces to enjoy. This is kind of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do that with this last pinnacle.""

For recreation the current plan is to design 6-7 miles of low-impact trails that hikers and mountain bikers can enjoy Barnhouse said. It would be similar to those in the Rattlesnake Ridge Natural Area and there could be a possibility of connecting some of the trails.

""It's a real nice mix of rocky outcroppings and tall rugged pinnacle but it also has some low easy slopes at the bottom that could be more friendly for beginner mountain bikers and kids. So it offers a little bit of a different terrain"" she said in comparison with Rattlesnake Ridge.

One of the hopes is that this new natural area can help alleviate some of the crowds at nearby popular spots.

Pinnacle Mountain is Arkansas' most visited state park with an estimated 5000-7000 people per day on Fridays Saturdays and Sundays according to the Heritage Division. Rattlesnake Ridge has had 42000–44000 visitors annually since it was acquired by the commission and conservancy in 2018.

The lands' dessert desertlike and rocky-grassland habitats resemble those more often found in southwest Colorado or Utah than Arkansas and they are home to unique plants and animals said Theo Witsell chief of research and inventory for the commission.

""It's really got this western feel. It's actually a relict natural community left from a hotter drying climatic period of the past"" he said.

""There's a really nice population of a globally rare wildflower called an Arkansas twistflower. It's a real showy hot pink and purple mustard. It's found in a few counties in the eastern Ouachita Mountains and nowhere else in the world.""

The Maumelle Pinnacles are home to several other species of state conservation concern: the Diana fritillary butterfly Southeastern bat Western diamondback rattlesnake and Wright's cliffbrake fern – known from just three sites in Arkansas. The rare Eastern collared lizard also has been spotted in the rock outcrops on the pinnacles by residents according to a commission report on the area.

Blue Mountain also is an important area for protecting drinking water and the water that flows into the Little Maumelle River Barnhouse said.

If all goes through Blue Mountain will be the state's 77th natural area for a total of about 71000 acres.

CORRECTION: Grant proposals have been submitted to the Arkansas Natural and Cultural Resources Council which is housed in the Division of Arkansas Heritage to help purchase a section of land containing Blue Mountain near Pinnacle Mountain State Park and Rattlesnake Ridge.

John Armstrong 32 was sentenced to prison by U.S. District Judge Wendy W. Berger for two 2019 bank robberies an attempted bank robbery a Hobbs Act robbery and three counts of brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence.

Armstrong plead guilty Sept. 22. Armstrong’s co-defendants Tanya Legg 45 North Fort Myers and Daniel Zirk 24 Spring Hill previously plead guilty and were sentenced in December 2020.

Armstrong was free on $125000 bail after an alleged August 2019 hit-and run crash that killed a woman on U.S. 41 when he committed two of the bank robberies police said.

The Aug. 30 crash at U.S. 41 and the access roads to the parking lots of Page Field Commons and Sam's Club resulted in the death of the driver of another car Edith Herrera Zamora 41 and injury to a passenger Maria Ramirez.

The case against Armstrong for the fatal crash is pending and he faces charges of hit-and-run involving serious bodily injury driving without a license causing death driving without a license causing bodily injury burglary trespassing and resisting arrest.

In the robberies according to police and court documents Armstrong used a gun to rob a 7-Eleven convenience store in North Fort Myers on June 14 2019. During this robbery Armstrong struck one of the store employees in the face with his gun.

On July 31 2019 Armstrong used a firearm to steal more than $151000 from a vault at the Bank OZK in Punta Gorda.

On September 25 2019 Armstrong and Zirk attempted to rob a PNC Bank in Davenport.

Zirk carjacked two vehicles earlier that morning holding the victims at gunpoint documents show. Armstrong and Zirk later used one of the carjacked vehicles as a getaway car following the attempted PNC Bank robbery. The robbery failed after the bank’s alarm went off.

The following day Armstrong Zirk and Legg robbed a BB&T Bank in Altamonte Springs during which Armstrong and Zirk threatened to kill the bank employees and used guns to force the employees to open the bank’s vault. They then stole about $22000 in cash from the vault.

Legg helped plan and purchase supplies for the BB&T Bank robbery and the attempted PNC Bank robbery. She also served as the getaway driver for these two robberies.

Information gathered from toll records and from license plate readers helped investigators track a vehicle they believe Armstrong used to travel from Fort Myers to the Orlando area and back. The banks in Altamonte Springs and Davenport are in the Orlando area.

On Dec. 9 2020 Legg was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Zirk was sentenced on Dec. 16 2020 to 22 years and 4 months in prison.

The federal Hobbs Act cited in the charges against Armstrong is used when there is an intent to rob including conspiracy and a scheme of two or more to commit a robbery.

This case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation with assistance from the Altamonte Springs Police Department the Fort Myers Police Department the Hernando County Sheriff’s Office the Lee County Sheriff’s Office the Orange County Sheriff’s Office the Orlando Police Department the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office the Pasco Sheriff’s Office the Punta Gorda Police Department the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office and the Tampa Police Department.

NEW DELHI: UK's Cairn Energy Plc has offered to forego USD 500 million and invest that amount in any oil and gas or renewable energy project identified by the Indian government if New Delhi agrees to honour an international arbitration award and returns the value of loss it incurred because of being taxed retrospectively sources said.The Scottish firm invested in the oil and gas sector in India in 1994 and a decade later it made a huge oil discovery in Rajasthan. In 2006-07 it listed its Indian assets on the BSE. Five years after that the government passed a retroactive tax law and billed Cairn Rs 10247 crore plus interest and penalty for the reorganisation tied to the flotation.The state then expropriated and liquidated Cairn's remaining shares in the Indian entity seized dividends and withheld tax refunds to recover a part of the demand.Cairn challenged the move before an arbitration tribunal in The Hague which in December awarded it USD 1.2 billion (over Rs 8800 crore) plus costs and interest which totals USD 1.725 million (Rs 12600 crore) as of December 2020.The company has in talks with finance ministry officials offered to forego the interest and cost totalling over USD 500 million and invest that sum in any oil and gas or renewable energy project identified by Indian government if the principal of USD 1.2 billion due to it is paid three sources with knowledge of the matter said.The Indian government which appointed one of the three arbitrators on The Hague panel and fully participated in the arbitration proceedings since 2015 wanted Cairn to settle the issue through its now-closed tax dispute resolution scheme Vivad se Vishwas Vivad se Vishwas scheme which closed on March 31 provided for dropping of tax case if 50% of the demand was paid which the company rejected they said.Even if it were to have agreed to the scheme the Indian government had to refund about Rs 2500 crore to the British firm they said adding the value of shares seized and sold dividend confiscated and tax refund withheld totaled to over Rs 7600 crore which was more than 50 per cent of the Rs 10247 crore principal tax demand raised.""The company has a tribunal ruling which says India breached its obligations to Cairn under the UK-India Bilateral Investment Treaty and that compensation in form of return of the value of shares seized and sold tax refund withheld and dividend confiscated was due. Instead you are asking it to pay half of the tax amount raised levying short-term capital gains tax is something that the company's marquee shareholders will never agree to"" one of them said.While Cairn declined to comment on the story finance ministry officials could not be immediately reached for comments.Cairn executives have since held three face-to-face meetings and at least one video call with top finance ministry officials to get them to honour the award.Both sides are eager to resolve the issue quickly without resorting to any harsh measures sources said.The Indian govt has appealed against the tribunal ruling on grounds that tax levied by a sovereign power should not be subject to private arbitration.In the meantime therefore Cairn which is of the opinion that the unanimous ruling of the tribunal was enforceable against Indian-owned assets in more than 160 countries that have signed and ratified the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards has hired asset-tracing firms to investigate the overseas assets that could be seized to recover the amount due.Cairn has already taken steps to have the arbitration award recognised in nine major jurisdictions such as the US UK France the Netherlands Singapore and Canada's Quebec province where Indian sovereign assets have been identified.It hasn't said what it might go after but assets could include Air India 's planes vessels belonging to the Shipping Corporation of India and property owned by state banks.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Mayor's Race Unfolds (Published 2021),"[Live N.Y.C. mayoral race primary results.]

Over the last year New York politics have appeared to lurch ever leftward. First came the primary victories last summer in a series of House and state legislative races then the legalization of recreational marijuana and just this week a state budget agreement that would raise taxes on the wealthy and create a $2.1 billion fund to aid undocumented workers.

But in the New York City mayor’s race the two candidates who have most consistently shown strength are among the most moderate in the field.

The sustained polling leads of Andrew Yang followed often by Eric Adams have made some left-wing activists and leaders increasingly alarmed about the trajectory of the race leaving them divided over how to use their considerable influence to shape its outcome before the June 22 primary.

“From my perspective on the left in New York there’s definitely a little sense of disappointment around how the race is shaping up right now” said Matthew Miles Goodrich who is involved with the Sunrise Movement an organization of young climate activists. “There seems to be a mismatch between who is leading in the New York City mayoral race and the tenor of the times that we’re supposed to be living in.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5d2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9kYXZpZC1ob2dnLXF1aXRzLXByb2dyZXNzaXZlLW15cGlsbG93LWNvbXBldGl0b3ItdHdvLW1vbnRocy1hZnRlci1sYXVuY2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Hogg Quits Progressive MyPillow Competitor Two Months After Launch,"Gun control activist David Hogg announced on Twitter late Saturday that he has exited Good Pillow a progressive MyPillow competitor he and partner William LeGate launched just two months ago apparently before the company produced a single product.

Hogg claims to have divested himself of his Good Pillow shares giving LeGate full ownership over the pillow company in order to focus more intently on his education and his activism; operating a small business was it seems harder than Hogg expected and was getting in the way of more pressing endeavors.

“On Saturday Hogg thanked his Good Pillow partner William LeGate and said he would focus on his college studies and gun-control activism” Newsweek reported.

“Effective immediately I have resigned and released all shares any ownership and any control of Good Pillow LLC” Hogg tweeted. “I want to thank his partnership and wish him absolutely nothing but success with the future of Good Pillow.”

“Over the next several months I will be taking some time to focus on my studies in college and advance the gun violence prevention movement with March for Our Lives and personally” he continued.

“We were met with immediate and overwhelming support. But I soon realized that given my activism schoolwork and family commitments I could not give 100% to being a full time co-founder at Good Pillow” Hogg explained. “After many discussions with William and my friends family and mentors I made the good faith decision to allow William to bring our vision to life without me. That vision remains an ethical company that produces products that people need while creating good union paying jobs and supporting social causes at the same time.”

It is not clear what “shares” Hogg is referring to as “Good Pillow” appears to be structured as a limited liability company (LLC) which does not issue shares.

As The Daily Wire reported in February Hogg intended the company to compete with MyPillow whose CEO was vocally supportive of former President Donald Trump following his November election loss. Hogg called the effort a “pillow fight” and even went so far as to recruit LeGate as a partner. The pair intended not just to run MyPillow out of business they said but to run Fox News out of business on the theory that MyPillow’s advertising dollars were the only factor keeping the news network on the air.

The endeavor quickly became complicated though. Progressive “customers” made an ever-increasing number of demands on Hogg’s fledgling pillow company Hogg and his partner failed to trademark “Good Pillow” or procure associated internet real estate and there was already a progressive competitor to MyPillow on the market.

“According to the trademark application ‘Good pillow’ was being registered for a ‘custom-built pillow’ to use the mark in commerce or in connection with identified goods and services” news website Meaww reported. “The application is now waiting to be assigned to an examining attorney approximately three months after the filing date which will take place in May 2021. The image registered with the application does not match the logo on Hogg’s and LeGate’s Good Pillow co website. At the time of reporting no other applications for the name have been filed under either Hogg’s or LeGate’s name.”

LeGate ignored much of Hogg’s Twitter stream saying simply “It has been a pleasure working with you David” and pledging to send Hogg “pillows from the first batch.”

Shipping LeGate claims is scheduled to begin in July.

Hogg’s announcement was widely met with mockery with social media denizens quick to suggest that Hogg had grossly underestimated how difficult it is to start and run a small business — and making good on bets they’d made when Hogg launched his company that the effort would be short-lived.

“I too have relinquished my imaginary shares in my imaginary company that makes imaginary pillows” announced one Twitter user.

Daily Wire host Michael Knowles said simply “lol.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDQvMTEvZGVtb2NyYXRzLWJpZGVuLWluZnJhc3RydWN0dXJlLWJpbGwtY3V0LTQ4MDY4NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biden's infrastructure plan heads for the Senate shredder,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/11/democrats-biden-infrastructure-bill-cut-480684 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDQvMTEvZGVtb2NyYXRzLWJpZGVuLWluZnJhc3RydWN0dXJlLWJpbGwtY3V0LTQ4MDY4NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3JrZGlzcGF0Y2guY29tL3N0b3J5L29waW5pb24vY29udHJpYnV0b3JzLzIwMjEvMDQvMTEvb3AtZWQtaWYtZ29wLW1pdGNoLW1jY29ubmVsbC1yZWFsbHktd2FudC13b2tlLWNvcnBvcmF0aW9ucy1vdXQtcG9saXRpY3MtaGVyZXMtaG93LzcxODEwOTQwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OP-ED: If GOP Mitch McConnell really wants 'woke' corporations out of politics here's how,"Will Bunch

The Philadelphia Inquirer (TNS)

Some advice for any young readers out there still looking for their soulmate: Find a life partner who looks at you the way Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has looked at America’s CEOs their three-martini lobbyists and their briefcases brimming with campaign cash. It’s the only green new deal the Kentuckian has ever cared about.

Arriving in Washington as a Senate backbencher in the mid-1980s McConnell conceived an unusual but diabolically brilliant path to power: Championing the idea that allowing corporations and their billionaire investors to funnel six- and seven-figure donations to reelect his new colleagues was the ultimate form of “free speech.”

When McConnell lost a battle on the Senate floor in the early 2000s to stop the campaign finance reform bill known as McCain-Feingold he took the radical step of filing a lawsuit and taking it all the way to the Supreme Court. The Kentucky senator lost that case but he got everything he wanted in a later ruling in the Citizens United case. McConnell then rode a wave of Big Business contributions in the 2010s to cut corporate taxes to modern record-low levels and pack the judiciary with the most pro-business judges since the Gilded Age as income inequality soared.

All this time McConnell waxed poetically about the First Amendment as if he were wearing a powdered wig and trying to portray James Madison in a one-man play or something. In 2012 addressing Democratic threats to rein in the rising abuses of the Citizens United age McConnell told the American Enterprise Institute that — in viewing unlimited political spending as free speech — you are producing “a marketplace of ideas that you shouldn’t be afraid of.” He added: “There’s no question that what they” — Democrats — “want to do is intimidate people into shutting up and believe me if you give that power to the government they will do it selectively.”

Last week McConnell who’s never found a height of hypocrisy that he couldn’t scale sounded utterly terrified by the marketplace of ideas and he spoke openly of the government using its power to selectively intimidate people into shutting up.

'Just a game for him': What changed in just nine years? With their valuable brands under pressure from consumers in an increasingly diverse progressive America more corporations are taking stands on issues like LGBTQ rights gun safety or now voting rights — often in opposition to McConnell’s reactionary Republican Party.

Suddenly Moscow Mitch’s beloved Fortune 500 is “dabbling in behaving like a woke parallel government.” He said that they “will invite serious consequences if they become a vehicle for far-left mobs to hijack our country from outside the constitutional order.” The minority leader in the 50-50 Senate didn’t say what those consequences could be — but others in the GOP have tried to strip Delta Air Lines of a tax break after it criticized Georgia’s new voter suppression law or proposed ending Major League Baseball’s antitrust exemption after it yanked its 2021 All-Star Game from the Peach State.

How serious was McConnell? Not very. He was quick to add that he wasn’t talking about campaign contributions — still the lifeblood of the modern Republican Party as it stubbornly clings to political power while its core base of white male voters shrinks.

“It’s all just a game for him” Lee Drutman a senior fellow at the New America think tank and author of the book ""The Business of America Is Lobbying"" told me last week. Drutman and others have chronicled how business — blindsided by the expanded regulatory power of the government in the 1970s — mastered the art of lobbying and of using the obtuse rulebook of Capitol Hill to block legislation and later to buy influence with unchecked donations.

But the nation’s social changes in the 21st century — and a political environment in which culture wars now seem to matter more than Economics 101 — have drastically altered the equation. Corporations competing for the best young talent are under pressure from their millennial and Gen Z employees for socially responsible business practices and social media campaigns can seriously damage a brand. Limits on voting rights have been part of the Republican playbook since the 1990s but today firms like Coca-Cola or Delta feel compelled to speak out.

Brink of change: But here’s the question raised by the new anticorporate fervor on the so-called populist pro-Trump right: Is the new flap over what conservatives call “corporate cancel culture” going to bring momentum for actual measures that would restrain that massive growth of corporate power — which would mean undoing everything that McConnell has accomplished in 36-plus years?

Right now Congress and the Biden administration seem on the brink of the biggest rollback of corporate power since Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal even if the moves have support from only Democrats so far.

— Pay a fair share of taxes. Along with the wholesale regulatory rollbacks that occurred under Donald Trump low taxes has always been the endgame for the Chamber of Commerce crowd even as studies show the extra cash boosted wealthy investors but didn’t lead toward high wages or broad economic gains. President Biden plans to restore some of that balance with his plan to raise the corporate tax rate from the current recent-historical low of 21% to 28% which would still be less than the rate had been for decades before the 2017 Trump tax bill.

But many corporations still pay little or no income taxes at all often through a shell game of shifting profits to overseas tax havens. There’s a pending bill from Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon that aims to both raise the rate and eliminate the loopholes in a weak provision in the 2017 Trump bill supposedly meant to recapture these lost dollars. And the Biden administration has endorsed an even bolder — albeit harder to pull off — plan for a “global minimum tax” that would neutralize the use of tax havens through international cooperation.

— Pass the For the People Act or HR 1. The measure that was approved by the House earlier this year and is awaiting action by the Senate has been in the news lately because the bill aims to expand citizens’ voting rights at a moment when so many GOP-led states are looking to curtail them. But the bill also includes provisions that would roll back corporate influence including a taxpayer-funded 6-1 donor match of small under-$200 contributions to federal candidates and disclosure rules aimed at identifying corporate “dark money” in elections. But lacking any Republican support HR 1 may be dead in the water with the refusal of West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin to reform the filibuster which now blocks it.

— Reduce the influence of corporate lobbyists. “There’s a practical how-Congress-does-its-business approach” said Drutman who has chronicled the rise of these K Street influencers. He said Capitol Hill could combat the modern success of business lobbying by expanding its staffs to bring in more policy experts so that the people drafting bills are wonks looking to improve the country as opposed to lawyers looking to pump up corporate profits.

The result of a true curbing-corporate-power agenda in Washington would be a boon for actual free speech — as it would make the government more responsive to the words of everyday people than to the dollars that flow from Wall Street or Silicon Valley. One shrewd analysis of the “corporate capture” of American government quotes the French economist Thomas Piketty: “If we are to regain control of capitalism we must bet everything on democracy.” Good advice but if you’re going to play this game of high-stakes poker start with the most important rule of all: Mitch McConnell is always bluffing.

In other words you can do what you want in America as long as you're not hurting anyone. So far as rules of thumb go it's an elegant one.

And it also serves as a simple illustration of a difficult truth that isn't often acknowledged in American politics: Freedom is never a zero-sum game.

Since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's presidency for example we've established a minimum wage that (most) employers have had to pay. For workers the minimum wage is an essential freedom to be protected because it ensures that if they work a full week they can afford the basic necessities. But for certain vulture capitalists the minimum wage is a freedom-killing constraint to be derided and overturned. From their perspective the minimum wage is impeding on their freedom to fatten profit margins by paying starvation wages.

Freedom in the workplace

Freedom isn't handed down in pure form by some omniscient higher power. It's determined by legislators enforced by courts and influenced by popular opinion. Like most human institutions the decision of who enjoys more freedom is often rigged toward the most powerful. The last 40 years of outsized corporate influence has marched to the drumbeat of anti-worker laws that restrict the rights of workers to unionize and to keep their home life private. In general the more freedoms your employers enjoy the fewer freedoms you enjoy in your workplace.

This week's episode of ""Pitchfork Economics"" features an interview with Mike Konczal the director of progressive thought at the Roosevelt Institute. Konczal's new book ""Freedom from the Market: America's Fight to Liberate Itself from the Grip of the Invisible Hand"" is about the junction between economics and freedom and how to reclaim some of the freedoms that American workers briefly captured in the middle of the 20th century.

Related stories

Konczal says the concept of trickle-down economics that ruled over American politics since the 1980s has been informed by the concept of prioritizing negative freedoms over positive freedoms. ""Negative freedom is the idea of freedom from the government and the idea that the government can't stop you from doing the things you want"" he explained whereas ""positive freedom is associated with a freedom to — a freedom to be able to get health care or get a good education.""

'Pro-freedom' and anti-government

For too long leaders on the left and right have bought into the libertarian concept that a government's primary role in protecting freedoms should be to limit government's power wherever possible. This anti-government stance is the reason why for instance the ""pro-freedom"" argument over the 2nd Amendment has long been to argue for the freedom of those who own the guns when gun safety advocates could just as logically argue that the freedom of the individual to go to school or participate in public events without fear of being killed in a mass shooting should take precedence.

The popular discourse has for decades been so absorbed with negative freedoms that benefit corporations Konczal says that we've forgotten to prioritize our individual positive freedoms.

""Is the government making us more or less free with the way the economy is structured?"" he said. ""I think it's increasingly less free in the past decades.""

Worker versus employer freedoms

Konczal says the recent debate over secure scheduling laws which require employers to post employee schedules in advance and pay workers extra for shifts added or canceled at the last minute are a good example of a positive freedom. Some workers he said ""don't start their weeks knowing the hours they're going to work over the next week.""

If employers aren't required to tell workers when they will and won't be working Konczal asked ""how do you build a robust social life with that kind of stress?"" Without the freedom to plan even one day ahead ""it's tough to start and maintain a family or to volunteer or join a bowling league — all the things that we think of as having a rich social life"" he explained.

Once you understand that worker freedoms have been trampled over the last 40 years you start to see examples everywhere. Consider the Jimmy John workers who were forced to sign agreements that said they couldn't go to work for another fast food restaurant if they quit or the janitors who unwittingly signed noncompete clauses. Think of how many people feel trapped in their jobs because they can't afford to give up the health insurance their employers provide. Can anyone really make the argument that these workers are anywhere near as free as their counterparts in nations with single-payer health care and stronger worker protections?

The economic power imbalance

In order to reestablish freedoms that benefit the individual Konczal argued that ""we need to decommodify spheres of our lives."" A public health care system and free public college would establish a baseline in which everyone has the freedom to pursue the life that they want and worker protections would allow people to live balanced lives.

And lastly ""we need to do something about the real disparities of wealth and income in this country through very aggressive progressive taxation"" Konczal said.

Freedom can't exist in a country with the kind of economic power imbalance that exists in America today. Your freedom to swing big bags of money around ends when your fortune risks crushing the livelihoods of millions of working Americans."

From a thermodynamic standpoint a change in molecular motion due to heat being added or removed from a system causes changes in temperature. Temperature changes affect various properties differently which makes heating and cooling control essential aspects of optimized functionality. This goes beyond simply hot neutral or cold and instead constitutes quantifying temperature fluctuations with accurate measurements based on how a particular property varies.

Temperature sensors are widely used to quantify temperature fluctuations. This is done by converting thermal energy from an object into electrical signals with either contact sensors or non-contact sensors using one of the two main signal processing methods: equilibrium and predictive. In the equilibrium method thermal equilibrium is reached between the sensor and the object being measured; therefore there is no difference in temperature between the two mediums and consequently no temperature gradients. With predictive signal processing thermal equilibrium is not reached between the sensor and is determined beforehand instead - hence the term predictive.

(Discover temperature sensor suppliers on GlobalSpec.)

As mentioned previously temperature sensors can be either contact or non-contact. Contact temperature sensors are in contact with the object and measure temperature using the predictive method. In other words these devices assume that the sensor and object are in thermal equilibrium. Examples of contact sensors include:

Full system thermometers

Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTDs)

Thermistors: Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) and Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC)

Thermocouples

Bimetallic Thermometers

Non-contact sensors aren’t in contact with the medium being measured and use convection or radiation to measure its surface temperature. The principle behind this technique is based on the infrared ray emitted by the object. This infrared ray is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that lies behind visible light and radio waves. By knowing that all bodies with a temperature above 0 degrees Kelvin radiate infrared energy and applying the Stefan-Boltzmann Law for radiated energy it’s possible to calculate the rate of heat loss by radiant emission.

Examples of non-contact temperature sensors are:

Fiber-optic temperature sensor

Pyrometers (optical and radiation)

Thermal imagers

Radiation thermometers

Top five industrial sensors

Whether sensing involving conduction radiation or convection various options are available for industrial applications. Similarly interested users can choose from different outputs such as analog logic or serial. The type chosen depends on the application and the desired temperature range. The top five temperature sensors are resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) thermocouples optical pyrometers semiconductor and fiber optic sensors.

Resistance temperature detectors (RTDs)

RTDs are contact sensors that are characterized according to temperature sensing elements and configurations. Platinum copper and nickel are the most common temperature sensing metals used in RTDs wheras configurations range from thin-film wire-wound and coiled.

RTDs operate based on the principle that the resistance of the element’s material changes directly with temperature. Platinum nickel and copper have a positive temperature coefficient; as temperature increases the resistance also increases demonstrating a linear relationship between the two. Therefore the sensor's material will determine the temperature range where it can be used. The link between material and temperature change is based on the predictable change in resistance accepted internationally as the standard for specific types of metals.

The most common RTD used in industrial settings is the PT100 made with platinum and has a temperature range of -250 degrees Celsius to 850 degrees Celsius. As a passive sensor RTDs require acceptable current excitation levels that will not alter temperature and introduce an error. A voltage output

Thermocouples

Thermocouples are contact temperature measuring devices that consist of two junctions of dissimilar materials welded together. One junction is kept at the reference temperature (cold) while the other is placed at the measuring medium (hot). Temperature differences between both ends of the junction cause an electric current to flow through the thermocouple. The strength of the current is used to determine the temperature of the medium being measured.

The metal alloys used at both junctions vary and range from Iron-Constantan Platinum-Rhodium Copper-Constantan Chromel-Alumel Tungsten-Rhenium among others.

Each material junction combination is designated as a specific type of thermocouple according to international standards. For example junctions joined with Iron-Constantan are designated as Type J thermocouples while Chromel–Alumel are designated as Type K thermocouples. The most sensitive thermocouples are Type J while the least sensitive are Type S. Thermocouple sensitivity temperature range material type resistance and life expectancy are deciding factors when selecting a particular type of thermocouple. The steelmaking industry process plants and manufacturing sectors are examples of sectors where thermocouples are used.

Thermistors

Thermistors are thermally sensitive resistors that exhibit a change in resistance as the temperature varies. These devices can have a positive or negative temperature coefficient. In negative temperature coefficient (NTC) devices the resistance value decreases as the temperature increases. For positive temperature coefficient (PTC) devices the resistance increases as temperature increases. NTC-type thermistors are more popular than PTC.

Thermistors are more sensitive to temperature changes than RTDs and thermocouples. As a result these devices are suited for application where minimal temperature changes are significant variables. Thermistors are not ideal for high-temperature applications due to being fragile and easily damaged in such conditions.

Thermistors exhibit a non-linear change in resistance that can be linearized with shunting with a fixed resistor. They are constructed from solid-semiconductor materials and are rated according to power rating resistive value and time constant.

(Discover thermistor suppliers on GlobalSpec.)

Pyrometers

Pyrometers are non-contact temperature measuring devices that work using infrared energy. Pyrometers can be optical or use radiation. Optical pyrometers work by comparing the visible light from an object with an electrically heated wire. Radiation pyrometers operate by measuring the infrared or visible light from an object.

Pyrometers have the advantage of not being in contact with an actual surface to measure temperature. Examples of use include monitoring the mains supply unit or measuring the surface temperature of components within specific machines.

(Discover pyrometers on GlobalSpec.)

Fiber-optic temperature sensor

Fiber-optic temperature sensors are non-contact devices suited for applications where specific activities are likely to interfere with sensor functionality. For example in industries where radio frequency interference (RFI) and electromagnetic interference (EMI) can affect operations such as explosion-proof areas or critical turbine areas in power plants. Other applications where fiber optic temperature sensors are used include the semiconductor industry plastics processing automated welding which is known to generate large amounts of electric fields.

Different types of fiber optic temperature sensors exist on the market. One type uses gallium arsenide crystal (GaAs) semiconductor by taking advantage of its material properties in blackbody physics. It's possible to determine the wavelengths and temperature that cause an absorption shift due to the semiconducting crystal's predictable characteristics.

Conclusion

Contact a non-contact sensors can be used for different applications depending on the targeted temperature range metal alloy used to measure temperature sensitivities environment and cost. From well-known PT100 to more advanced fiber-optic temperature sensors molecular motion across a medium is being measured with various technologies.

Just remember that your self-storage tenants are still facing challenges including financial hardship.

Early in the pandemic you might’ve heard about government orders being passed including eviction moratoriums and foreclosure forbearance. As these measures are lifted that piper will need to be paid. Many of your customers will find themselves facing evictions or foreclosure claims for unpaid rent or mortgages which could easily reach many thousands of dollars. This is on top of deferred utility bills credit card payments and other financial obligations creditors haven’t been able to collect. As all this debt comes due your customers may not be able to pay what they owe which may lead them to file for bankruptcy.

If ever you are put on notice that a tenant of yours has filed for bankruptcy you must act appropriately to avoid legal risk. This article explains what you need to know about the filing and what actions you need to take.

Respect the Filing

The problem with bankruptcy law is it’s counterintuitive. What you may think would be right and fair is sometimes exactly the opposite. The law is written to protect the debtor not his creditors. It doesn’t matter if you disagree with that concept. A violation of a bankruptcy order can result in contempt of court. You could face paying damages to the debtor and even be forced to pay his attorney’s fees. Contempt-of-court orders could also include jail time!

It’s also important to know that you can be involved in a bankruptcy even if the debtor doesn’t owe you money at the time of filing. This happens because you can be listed in the bankruptcy petition for reasons other than being a creditor for example holding a security deposit.

In addition (and this is important): Just because you don’t receive formal written notice from the tenant or the court of a bankruptcy any oral or implied notice is good enough. At that point you must assume a bankruptcy has been filed and act in accordance with the rules. So if a tenant or someone who knows him tells you he has filed or plans to file—even if you haven’t received written notice—the burden shifts to you. You must determine whether this alleged filing is true before acting against your tenant or proceeding with collections.

Understand the Automatic Stay

The first concept you need to understand about bankruptcy is the automatic stay. As soon as a bankruptcy is filed with the court an automatic-stay order is issued without the judge even seeing the filing. This gives the debtor protections under bankruptcy law which provides that no creditor may take any action to collect a debt once the bankruptcy is filed. This is true even if you believe it’s filed in bad faith.

These actions include the commencement or continuation of any sort of judicial proceeding. In self-storage that would refer to sending bills late notices automatic texts imposition of additional fees lien notices or conducting lien sales or evictions. As soon as you believe or know a bankruptcy has been filed you must stop everything you’re doing to collect that tenant’s debt. This means halting all automatic services such as automated texts or calls lest you violate the automatic stay.

Get a Social Security Number

Tenant bankruptcy is one reasons why it’s so important for you to obtain the tenant’s Social Security number (SSN) at the time of rental. If ever he files for bankruptcy or alleges he has his SSN is the best way for you to confirm that. It allows your attorney to check the federal government’s court-docket system.

If a tenant says “I’m filing for bankruptcy” and you’re a couple days away from a lien sale you can use his SSN to verify that statement and know whether you need to stop the auction. Without this vital piece of information your hands are tied and you must stop just based on his word. Many tenants will tell a self-storage operator they’re going to file but don’t actually do it. Without the right information you’ll be stymied.

Find Out the Filing Type

Once you have word rumor notice or even innuendo of a bankruptcy it’s time to call your attorney. He’ll ask whether you know the chapter of bankruptcy filed.

Most bankruptcies involving your tenants are Chapter 7 which is an attempt to discharge all unsecured debt and even some secured debt. There’s also Chapter 13 sometimes known as a wage-earner plan whereby the bankruptcy runs for a period and the debtor pays off some or all the debt through garnishment of wages into a plan. If this is the case you’ll need to provide proof of claim to the court to participate. Chapter 11 is a business reorganization similar to a Chapter 13 but more suited for companies rather than individuals.

Work Your Remedy

One of the most common mistakes made by self-storage operators is trying to negotiate some sort of repayment of the past-due rent with the tenant after he files for bankruptcy with or without move-out. This violates the automatic-stay order!

Thankfully you do have a remedy. You don’t have to wait for months or years for the bankruptcy to resolve itself. Rather you can negotiate for the tenant to leave. To be safe your attorney should oversee these negotiations. If the tenant is unable or unwilling to vacate your attorney can file a motion for relief from the automatic stay which the court would be able to grant. This allows you the right to remove the tenant from your storage unit.

Understand though that this approach can be extremely complicated particularly with Chapter 11 bankruptcies. It’s become even more convoluted since the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) was passed in December. It seems to have extended the time for a lease rejection. Thus working with your attorney is exceptionally important.

The CAA also altered the rules for preferential payments which are those you may receive from your tenant before he files bankruptcy. If you plan to take payments from a customer in default speak to your attorney especially if you fear the tenant might file bankruptcy in the near future. Your legal representative can help you potentially avoid these monies being recouped under the new preference guidelines in the bankruptcy code.

Remember if the tenant isn’t going to pay you after filing bankruptcy have your attorney negotiate a move-out. This is your best remedy. Don’t allow a debtor who’s filed to simply remain in your space without payment just because you don’t understand your rights under the code.

Bankruptcy is a tricky area of the law. If you have a tenant who has or could file for bankruptcy don’t think you can handle it yourself. Contact your attorney and let him help you through this. It may cost you a few dollars but the representation will in this instance be well worth the legal fees.

(CBS4) - A clinic administering COVID-19 vaccines in El Paso County was told to pause its operations over concerns about vaccine storage. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment says it issued Dr. Moma Health and Wellness a suspension notice meaning they will not receive doses until the investigation is complete.

CDPHE says El Paso County Public Health visited the clinic where they say storage protocols were not followed. The county then alerted the Joint Vaccine Task Force.

The clinic has administered nearly 4000 vaccines according to the Colorado Immunization Information System. An investigation is underway to determine whether the storage incident was isolated and whether the clinic followed protocols consistently.

""Health officials do not believe patients at this site have cause for concern but are in the process of determining whether those previously vaccinated at this location will need to re-initiate their vaccine series as occasionally happens with similar occurrences involving other vaccines"" said the CDPHE in a news release.

More than 7000 appointments were canceled at the clinic through May 8 including more than 1000 being for April 10.

Kelly signs legislation that made its way to her desk,"TOPEKA Kan. (WIBW) - Governor Laura Kelly has signed several pieces of bipartisan legislation.

Governor Laura Kelly says she has signed several bipartisan bills that will implement changes for Kansans communities and businesses.

“I want to thank the Legislature for their work to get these pieces of bipartisan commonsense legislation to my desk” Governor Kelly said. “These bills are a testament to what we can get done for Kansans when we work together toward mutually agreeable solutions to make life better for the people in our state.”

According to Gov. Kelly Senate Bill 52 establishes the Sedgwick Co. Urban Area Nuisance Abatement Act which authorizes the Board of County Commissioners to order the removal or abatement of any nuisance from any property in the incorporated area of Sedgwick Co. She said all costs associated with the abatement will be the responsibility of the property owner.

Gov. Kelly said before the abatement process could start the bill requires the County to first get a conviction for a county code violation regarding the nuisance no more than one year before the issuance of the abatement order.

According to the Kansas Governor Senate Bill 172 amends the Kansas Criminal Code which regards crimes involving property by eliminating the crime of tampering with a pipeline and establishes four new crimes: trespassing on a critical infrastructure facility aggravated trespassing on a CIF criminal damage to a CIF and aggravated criminal damage to a CIF. She said the bill also allows a judge to order restitution for property damage to any victim of the four new crimes.

Gov. Kelly said House Bill 2022 amends laws that concern the filing of complaints and investigations about abandoned wells responsible parties for plugging said wells and funds used by the Kansas Corporation Commission for plugging abandoned wells.

According to Gov. Kelly House Bill 2050 amends statutes to remove requirements that following be provided to the Legislative Division of Post Audit the Post Auditor or the Legislative Post Audit Committee:

An audited statement of expenditures by a Kansas nonprofit corporation that provides legal service to indigent inmates of Kansas correctional institutions.

A certified summary of the write-off of any accounts receivable or taxes receivable by the Director of Account and Reports.

An annual audit of corporations that contract with the Board of Regents or any state educational institution and are controlled by the Board or such institution.

An annual report by the Secretary of Revenue regarding tax abatements that reduce final tax liability by $5000 or more.

Additionally Gov. Kelly said the bill makes technical amendments to ensure consistency in statutory phrasing and remove an outdated retroactivity provision.

According to Gov. Kelly House Bill 2070 allows private not-for-profit postsecondary educational institutions in the state to collect a surcharge on credit card payments. She said the Kansas Uniform Consumer Credit Code bars sellers from taking a surcharge on credit card payments with exceptions that include Kansas public institutions municipal universities community colleges technical colleges and vocational schools.

Gov. Kelly said Senate Substitute for House Bill 2072 creates the Utility Financing and Securitization Act which allows for the securitization of utility assets to recover energy transition costs for electric public utilities with retail rates subject to the KCC.

According to the Kansas Governor the UFSA also allows electric and natural gas public utilities with retail rates subject to the KCC to pursue scrutinization to help finance qualified extraordinary expenses like fuel costs incurred during extreme weather events.

Gov. Kelly said House Bill 2112 allows online advertisement and sales of abandoned property by self-storage rental unit operators provides for the designation by occupants of an alternate contact and limits claims for loss or damage of stored property to the property value limit provided in the rental agreement.

According to Gov. Kelly House Bill 2126 gives immunity from civil liability for COVID-19 claims for certain covered facilities including adult care homes community mental health centers crisis intervention centers community service providers and community developmental disability organizations.

Gov. Kelly said House Bill 2145 exempts the retail sale of electricity by public utilities for electric vehicle charging stations from the jurisdiction of the state corporation commission.

According to Gov. Kelly House Bill 2155 provides for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment response operations for water and soil pollutant release discharge or escape.

Gov. Kelly said House Bill 2162 amends and repeals reapportionment census data laws to parallel 2019 amendments to the Kansas constitution and to remove certain provisions that are now obsolete.

According to the Kansas Governor House Bill 2214 authorizes the Secretary of Administration of the Department of Corrections to convey land in Mitchell Co. to the City of Beloit.

Gov. Kelly said House Bill 2298 changes requirements of services of process on nonresident drivers and clarifies service of process on certain businesses.

The map of the northern segment of the Ontario Line published by Metrolinx in their October 2020 blog article has been added for reference. Scroll down to the end of the article.

Metrolinx has unveiled a plan for the Ontario Line’s Maintenance and Storage Facility north of Thorncliffe Park. Because of the local terrain green space and the Hydro corridor (not shown on the map below) this is split into three distinct sections:

The main buildings are west of Beth Nealson Drive north of the Don River.

Some servicing areas are in a long spur parallel to the CPR corridor. This will also be the location of a delivery track where vehicles will arrive from the manufacturer.

The storage yard will be in an area now occupied by various shops and offices as well as a mosque.

Here is a satellite view from Google Maps rotated to match the orientation of the map above.

The area to be occupied by the yard at the north end of Thorncliffe Park Drive West is shown below. This was taken before the Costco building went up on the vacant land in the upper right of the photo. The Ontario line will run north from Overlea Boulevard along the west edge of this property.

According to the Metrolinx Blog article on this plan the site was chosen from a list of nine. Metrolinx has not published the other locations that were considered.

The work we did to identify the best site for the MSF and yard will be pulled together as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report that will be available in 2022. We can let you know we looked at land near the western terminus at Exhibition all the way to the east and to the northern end of the alignment. A list of nine sites were brought forward for more detailed analysis some of which were ruled out because they weren’t big enough or they affected too many businesses and jobs. The site in the southeast portion of the Leaside Business Park was selected because our studies showed that it keeps impacts to the local community to a minimum while meeting all of the needs for the project: • it is already zoned for industrial use; • it is close to the main line making it quick and easy for trains to go in and out of service; • it is large enough to meet future needs; • it minimizes community impacts; • has less individual job impacts. Email from Metrolinx Media Relations April 9 2021

While the northern portion that will house the main buildings might only displace a self-storage farm the southern portion where the yard will be located sits on top of buildings that are an integral part of the Thorncliffe Park community. What the reaction will be might be gauged at an online meeting to be held on April 15 2021 at 6:30 pm.

When Metrolinx announced their revised route through Thorncliffe Park in October 2020 they touted the fact that this would avoid disruption of buildings such as the Macedonian Orthodox Cathedral. The map of the revised route is below.

Note the area labelled “MSF Study Area”. This is the location in the updated plan for the Operation and Maintenance building. The area at the north end of Thorncliffe Park Drive West is not touched by the line and there would be no reason for anyone to raise flags about the businesses and institutions already there.

The yard which is now part of the complex is completely new and there was no advance indication that this would be part of the design.

On a related note one of the comments below from Simon Hirst suggests that an alternate location might be the land on the other side of the CPR corridor now occupied by a gravel and cement company. This is visible as a white patch directly above the “MSF Study Area” in the Metrolinx map above (where “north” is to the right and “west” is up) and in the view below which is a closer view of the same area in the usual geographic orientation.

If that area were to be used a connection tunnel would have to go under the CPR to link with the Ontario Line whose main shops and offices would be where the brown-roofed buildings labelled “Toronto Moving and Storage” are in the upper right of the photo.

Because Metrolinx has not published its list of alternative sites we do not know whether this option was considered but rejected for some reason.

Metrolinx does not plan to publish its alternative site analysis until Fall 2022 with the Environmental Project Report but they also intend to let the contract the includes construction of the MSF and yard at roughly the same time precluding major changes in design."

The fine which represents 4 percent of Alibaba’s 2019 domestic sales is three times higher than the $975 million fine China imposed on US chip company Qualcomm back in 2015.

The Chinese government launched an investigation into Alibaba in December to determine whether the company was preventing merchants from selling their products on other platforms. China’s market regulator found that Alibaba’s practices had a negative effect on online retail competition and innovation. Alibaba used data and algorithms to strengthen its own position in the marketplace resulting in an “improper competitive advantage” China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said in a statement. The company will have to reduce its anticompetitive tactics and provide compliance reports to the government for the next three years.

Alibaba said in a statement it accepted the fine and pledged to make improvements to better serve its “responsibility to society.”

“We will further strengthen our focus on customer value creation and customer experience as well as continuing to introduce measures to lower entry barriers and business costs of operating on our platforms” the company’s statement reads. “We are committed to ensuring an operating environment for our merchants and partners that is more open more equitable more efficient and more inclusive in sharing the fruits of growth.”

The hefty fine is not likely to hurt Alibaba’s bottom line too severely however; in February the company reported a third quarter profit — for the final three months of calendar year 2020 alone— of $12 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MxOC5jb20vbmV3cy90ZWNoL3hpYW9taS10by1sYXVuY2gtcXVhbGNvbW0tc25hcGRyYWdvbi04ODgtc29jLW9uLWFwcmlsLTIzLXdpdGgtbWktMTEtdWx0cmEtMzYyOTg0OS5odG1s0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3czE4LmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy90ZWNoL3hpYW9taS10by1sYXVuY2gtcXVhbGNvbW0tc25hcGRyYWdvbi04ODgtc29jLW9uLWFwcmlsLTIzLXdpdGgtbWktMTEtdWx0cmEtMzYyOTg0OS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xiaomi to Launch Multiple Qualcomm Snapdragon 888-Powered Smartphones on April 23 With Mi 11 Ultra,"Xiaomi had earlier this month announced that it will launch its latest flagship the Xiaomi Mi 11 in India on April 23. The company has now announced that it will launch multiple Mi 11 smartphones on April 23. In a new teaser Xiaomi Global Vice President Manu Kumar Jain has said that the company will launch “many Mi phones” with Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC hinting at the launch of the Mi 11 Series in the country. Xiaomi had announced the Mi 11 Ultra launch before launching the vanilla Mi 11 smartphone so it could be assumed that the company will launch both on April 23. The Xiaomi VP shared a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 teaser video with the tweet. “Happy to bring #Snapdragon888 on not 1 but many Mi phones” Jain said indicating that the company will launch multiple Snapdragon 888-powered smartphones.

The Mi 11 series now has five smartphones – Mi 11 Mi 11 Pro Mi 11 Ultra Mi 11i and the Mi 11 Lite 5G. Out of these the Mi 11 Mi 11 Pro Mi 11 Ultra and the Mi 11i are powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC while the Mi 11 Lite 5G is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 780 chipset. For now only the Mi 11 Ultra is the confirmed to launch on April 23 while the other launches remain a mystery.

The Mi 11 Ultra comes with a 6.81-inch AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate and a 480Hz touch sampling rate. This is rated at 1700 nits of brightness and is ready for HDR10+ and Dolby Vision content. The Mi 11 Ultra is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC paired with up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The Xiaomi Mi 11 has a 5000mAh battery that supports 67W fast wireless and wired charging.

There are three cameras at the back—a 50-megapixel main sensor a 48-megapixel periscope telephoto sensor and a 48-megapixel ultrawide. The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra is the first smartphone to use Samsung’s new ISOCELL GN2 sensor. This has large 1.4-micron pixels which when pixel binning is deployed to combine the data from multiple pixels into one becomes 2.8-microns for standard photos. The Mi 11 Ultra does 5x optical zoom 10x hybrid zoom and 120x digital zoom. This also has a 64-point laser focus system. On paper this should be right up there with what you’d expect from a flagship Android phone in terms of photography but a lot will depend on how the image processing algorithms have been tweaked—and that’s something we’ll know only when we get to experience the phone. That’s not all.

The camera module also integrates a 1.1-inch AMOLED display sitting next to the camera module which should be great news for those who tend to take a lot of selfies and can be used for peeking at notifications when the smartphone is placed face down.

A four-month investigation by the State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) concluded (link in Chinese) that the e-commerce titan unfairly squeezed out competition among online retail platforms by forcing vendors to choose between its services and those of its rivals.

The probe also found that the tech giant which was founded by beleaguered entrepreneur Jack Ma impeded the free flow of goods and services stifled innovation among platforms infringed the rights and interests of online sellers and harmed consumer interests.

The penalty is three times as high as China’s previous record antitrust fine which saw U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. pay just over 6 billion yuan in 2015. It comes amid an extensive government crackdown on monopolistic practices on the internet particularly in the e-commerce and fintech sectors.

In a statement on Saturday Alibaba said it accepted the fine “with sincerity” and would “ensure its compliance with determination” adding that the penalty “reflects the regulators’ thoughtful and normative expectations toward our industry’s development.”

The sum is equivalent to 4% of Alibaba’s domestic sales revenue in 2019 and does not include repayments of income deemed to have been obtained illegally. China’s Antitrust Law states that operators which abuse their dominant market positions may be fined an amount corresponding to between 1% and 10% of their annual sales revenue.

By comparison the fine on Qualcomm — which was imposed by a different government body the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) — was equivalent to 8% of the company’s sales at the time.

The SAMR inquiry mainly covered Alibaba’s activities between 2015 and 2019 and focused on a practice known as “picking sides” whereby the company forces merchants on its e-commerce platforms which include Taobao and Tmall to work exclusively with Alibaba and shun its competitors.

Two of Alibaba’s rivals JD.com Inc. and Pinduoduo Inc. have long complained that the practice unfairly cuts them out of potential deals with the same vendors.

The regulator concluded that Alibaba breached a provision in Article 17 of China’s Antimonopoly Law that prohibits companies from “refusing to enter into transactions” with other traders “without justifiable reasons.”

In an article published Saturday in the state-run Economic Daily newspaper Shi Jianzhong a member of an antitrust expert group under the State Council China’s cabinet said SAMR had been “relatively moderate” in settling on a fine equivalent to 4% of Alibaba’s sales revenue.

The comparative restraint “has shown the nation’s attitude and determination to strengthen antitrust regulation of platform enterprises as well as the policy objectives of supporting the development of the platform economy” he wrote.

A person close to the investigation who requested anonymity in order to speak freely told Caixin that the decision may set a global precedent in antitrust cases as no other country had previously dealt with picking sides insofar as the practice pertains to major e-commerce platforms.

China is in the throes of a sweeping clampdown on monopolistic behavior at the country’s major technology and internet firms. Days before the probe into Alibaba was announced in December the Communist Party’s top decision-making body pledged to strengthen antitrust efforts in 2021 to curb what the Politburo has called “disorderly capital expansion.”

That phrase appeared again Saturday in an editorial by the party-run People’s Daily newspaper which described Alibaba’s punishment as a “concrete measure” to prevent haphazard capital growth and an “effective norm” for bringing online platforms to heel.

The government is also in the process of thrashing out changes to the Antimonopoly Law which came into effect in 2008 but has drawn criticism for being ill-suited to combat abuses in China’s fast-growing online sector — especially when it comes to restraining big-tech behemoths operating sprawling platforms with vast influence over businesses and their patrons.

Alibaba’s fine is the latest setback to hit the interests of Ma who has maintained a stake in the New York- and Hong Kong-listed firm since stepping down from its board in 2019.

Amid regulatory concerns Chinese authorities in November abruptly suspended a planned $34.5 billion initial public offering in Hong Kong and Shanghai by Alibaba’s fintech affiliate Ant Group Co. Ltd. which counts Ma as its largest shareholder. The IPO would have been the world’s biggest ever.

A dual SIM phone allows you to easily take advantage of data/texting/calling promotions on various networks it lets you use a foreign SIM when traveling without having to give up your local SIM and you can have separate business/personal numbers on one phone.

The technology is maturing with the advent of 5G too and the first dual SIM 5G phones (5G+5G) have already launched. Here’s what you should know about the feature.

5G+5G dual SIM explained Dual-SIM 5G (or 5G+5G dual SIM as an alternative term) simply refers to the ability to use two 5G SIMs in the same phone being able to connect to two different 5G networks without physically swapping out SIM cards. We’ve also heard of “5G multi-SIM” being thrown around but this generally applies to 5G+4G dual SIM phones at the moment.

In any event dual SIM 5G phones aren’t very common right now. In fact very few phones support it.

Supported dual SIM 5G phones

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

There are several phones available globally that offer 5G+5G dual SIM technology and these are largely budget entries. One of the more notable devices is the Redmi Note 9T coming in at just €230 (~$273) and available in Europe South Africa and several other locales. Another noteworthy device in this regard is the Rs 16999 (~$226) realme Narzo 30 Pro available in India and a few other markets.

We’ve also seen a few more higher-end devices get dual-SIM 5G capabilities such as the Rs 29999 (~$400) realme X7 Pro and the 2198 yuan (~$336) Iqoo Z1. But the latter is limited to China unfortunately.

Either way there’s a decent chance your region has a 5G+5G dual SIM phone available to purchase. Well unless you’re in the US.

Which chipmakers support dual SIM 5G? MediaTek fired off the first shot by supporting dual-SIM 5G on its Dimensity 1000/1000 Plus flagship silicon as well as the Dimensity 820 chipset. It’s since expanded this support to budget chipsets like the Dimensity 800U and Dimensity 700 in addition to its latest flagship processors (Dimensity 1200 and 1100).

The Taiwanese chip designer doesn’t support dual-SIM 5G throughout its Dimensity range though as the Dimensity 800 and Dimensity 720 don’t offer these capabilities. Read: 5G is not going to microwave your brain — All the myths debunked

Qualcomm doesn’t currently have 5G+5G dual-SIM support but confirmed to Android Authority last year that it was indeed working on the technology.

“Our plans are definitely to offer 5G+5G dual-SIM and VoNR coming up (sic)” Alex Katouzian Qualcomm senior vice-president and general manager of mobile told us in an interview in late 2020.

What did Qualcomm say about existing solutions?

Katouzian also questioned the feasibility of competing 5G+5G dual SIM solutions at the time of the interview asserting that it requires Voice over NR (VoNR) tech which in turn requires a standalone 5G network (as opposed to NSA 5G used everywhere today). Current 5G NSA networks only provide a 5G data connection to your handset while calls fall back to 4G LTE. This will change with the future 5G SA network where voice can be handled over the 5G pipe.

“But as of today those networks don’t exist. So we do support 5G+4G dual SIM” the Qualcomm representative stated at the time. “5G+5G dual-SIM all that means is I get a 5G icon on one of the SIMs (sic). It’s not really VoNR.”

For what it’s worth MediaTek’s 5G+5G dual-SIM solutions are listed as supporting VoNR technology and those future standalone 5G networks. So even though the networks still rely on legacy infrastructure to route calls (e.g. VoLTE) it certainly sounds like MediaTek-powered phones will be able to take advantage of the tech once standalone 5G networks are established. Related: Snapdragon SoC guide: All of Qualcomm’s smartphone processors explained

In plain English people buying a MediaTek phone with 5G+5G dual-SIM connectivity can still use 5G data on both SIMs. It’s just that calls will take place over 4G which is what current 5G phones do right now anyway (regardless of whether they’re single or dual SIM). When the required infrastructure is in place for calls over 5G as Qualcomm envisions it it looks like MediaTek phones with 5G+5G tech can hop aboard too.

Then again people likely aren’t buying 5G phones because they were promised better voice calls. So does the argument matter when you’re connected to a real 5G network and getting those super-fast speeds?

MediaTek declined to respond to Qualcomm’s comments at the time but told Android Authority that its publicly shared information regarding 5G+5G dual-SIM remains accurate. Oddly enough it now describes its Dimensity 1200 processor as “the first 5G chip to provide True Dual 5G SIM (5G SA + 5G SA).” This implies that its previous 5G+5G dual SIM functionality wasn’t technically “true” in some form suggesting there may have been more merit to Qualcomm’s initial claim.

We previously asked HUAWEI regarding its plans for dual-SIM 5G technology and phones but the company refused to comment. Samsung also declined to comment on its plans for dual SIM 5G support in Exynos chipsets when we asked the company last year.

The future of dual SIM 5G? Qualcomm’s confirmation that it’s working on 5G+5G dual-SIM support means we should expect to see the tech in many more phones. After all there aren’t many phones powered by MediaTek’s Dimensity chipsets right now. Unfortunately none of the firm’s chipsets launched in late 2020 or early 2021 support this feature yet.

The US chip designer didn’t reveal a timeline for dual SIM 5G tech in its chipsets but we’re guessing that we’ll need to wait until the second half of 2021 at the very least.

It served as the first in-person WWE event to be held since the beginning of the pandemic.

There were long lines of excited fans Saturday as Wrestlemania 37 took center stage in Tampa Bay.

""Everyone’s out here today and they love it! WrestleMania is going down tonight baby"" wrestling fan David Hernandez said.

Many fans were worried if an in-person event would even be possible after WrestleMania 36 was canceled last year due to the pandemic.

""Ain’t nothing else bigger than Wrestlemania man. This is the Super Bowl of wrestling. If you want to see a show you come to WrestleMania. I mean this is it"" Hernandez said.

More than 25000 fans were allowed a seat inside Raymond James Stadium.

To bring this event closer to home two Tampa Bay residents and former wrestlers are serving as the official hosts: the legendary Hulk Hogan a longtime Clearwater resident and Titus O’Neil who has become well known for his philanthropy throughout the Bay Area.

""When I walk out there I think the biggest thing for me the hardest thing for me Will be not to be overwhelmed when I walk out there and hear them for the first time live"" WWE superstar Drew McIntyre said.

Masks are required for the two-day event taking place both Saturday and Sunday. Temperature checks and health screenings are being conducted upon entry.

If you can’t make it out in person the entire two-night event will be streamed live on the WWE Network channel on Peacock TV.

""I’m really excited. Kofi Kingston is my favorite"" 7-year-old wrestling fan Santino Motta said.

As soon as the show was about to begin WWE commentator Michael Cole announced a delay due to weather conditions.

Florida's forecast had predicted thunderstorms on both nights of the Show of Shows and unfortunately the rains came before the wrestling extravaganza could even start.

The harsh wind began knocking over floor seats while traffic outside the arena was reportedly at a standstill.

Fans already inside the Raymond James Stadium were told over the PA system that they were temporarily evacuating due to weather concerns.

It said: ""Ladies and gentlemen please be advised as severe weather including lightning is within the immediate vicinity of Raymond James Stadium.

""At this time we ask that all fans seek shelter on the covered concourse nearest your seats.""

Respected wrestling journalist Bryan Alvarez claimed that such was the severity of the conditions that WWE have put WrestleMania ""on hold"".

The report added that the company's tech department are fixing some minor damage before the pre-show can get underway.

The two-day event that is Wrestlemania 37 is about to get underway in Tampa Florida but inclement weather could be in the cards for the biggest event on the WWE calendar. The National Weather Service is forecasting a 40 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms after 5 p.m. ET with a chance for small hail and gusty winds up to 21 mph.

This radar image is rather ominous.

The event is taking place outdoors marking the second time in three years Wrestlemania has taken place under the stars. It was scheduled to be in Tampa last year but the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in Tampa’s hosting duties getting bumped back one year.

The rain is not ideal for those in attendance at Raymond James Stadium but it likely won’t be a big problem for most of the matches. It would appear from this video that the ring itself should be able to be covered for matches. Of course odds seem decent somebody wants to take a bump off one of the pirate ships and that exposure raises concerns.

This will be something to track throughout the evening. There’s a chance of showers on Sunday but it appears to be less of a concern than Saturday."

Without question the biggest problem are resellers on eBay and other resale sites - or dastardly profiteers according to desperate gamers looking to upgrade their rigs. There are even entire collectives of resellers buying up all available stock using bots and other means to corner the market for these products which are seeing unprecedented demand.

Compounding the problem component parts like RAM and semiconductors are facing supply bottlenecks resulting in shortages of the parts needed to churn out more cards to meet the demand. And since these parts are needed for everything from graphics cards to video game consoles and even to cars this is a much bigger problem than just GPUs.

To make this perfect storm of supply woes even worse just as the latest graphics cards started to hit the market in the fall and winter of 2020 Ethereum and Bitcoin values started to soar. Whether this was a product of the new more powerful GPUs making it to market or just really bad timing in either case demand for graphics cards of all stripes started to soar as crypto-49ers gobbled up whatever they could find looking to make it big in the cryptocurrency boom.

Since returns for mining cryptocurrency suddenly spiked many miners have been willing to pay the premium being charged by resellers online so long as they could make their profitability formulas come out positive in the end. How much of the problem of resellers overlaps with cryptocurrency mining isn't clear not even to Nvidia but unlike all the other issues mining is at least a problem that Nvidia could try to address directly.

The question is whether their solution dedicated cryptomining processors (CMPs) will be enough to help alleviate some of the demand pressure on their new Ampere cards so that these cards can be more easily purchased by the gamers who want them.

Unfortunately some recent reports and leaked specs on one of these new CMPs isn't very promising.

Hashing profits out of graphics cards

To understand why Nvidia's CMP doesn't look like a great solution we're going to compare the newest graphics cards from both Nvidia and AMD and see how well they do when mining Ethereum. To keep things simple we're going to use US dollars for comparison sake since the value itself isn't what matters but the difference between the cards which will be consistent across currencies other than USD.

We're also focusing on Ethereum rather than Bitcoin since ETH is the cryptocurrency that is currently ""booming"" right now and drawing the most attention from miners - especially newbies.

Without going into too much detail about how cryptomining works the thing that matters here is the formula cryptominers use to measure whether its worth buying a graphics card for cryptomining. It's not a complicated formula and the math isn't very hard but to spare us a bunch of equations on the page we use the CryptoCompare Ethereum Mining Profitability calculator.

There are a lot of moving variables when mining including power use hash rates (measured in megahashes per second or MH/s) and the price of ETH so we're going to staple a couple of variables to the wall and focus on hash rates. The power consumption will be left at what the cards specs list as the board's power draw and we're using my current kWh rate of $0.111724. None of our calculations take into account the price of the card itself when determining profitability we'll get to that in a bit.

With these constraints we look at Nvidia's CMP specs and calculate a rough profitability based on what we know. Starting from the lower end the Nvidia 30HX has a hash rate of 26 MH/s the 40HX rate is 36 MH/s the 50HX rate is 45 MH/s with the highest end CMP the 90HX coming in with 90 MH/s.

In our calculations these cards generate $1.94 $2.65 $3.26 and $7.00 of profit a day at current ETH prices. Of all the currently available Ampere and Radeon RX 6000-series cards only the RTX 3060 with the hash rate limiter enabled has a profitability significantly below the CMPs with $1.47 a day. Turn off the hash rate limiter which miners have already figured out how to do and the RTX 3060's profitability jumps to $3.47 a day which is still the lowest profitability of any of the next-gen cards but is greater than every CMP other than the 90HX.

The 90HX's profitability of $7.00 beats out the profitability of every card other than the RTX 3090 which earns about $9.71 a day in profit. The other cards fall in between with the RTX 3060 Ti earning $4.53 the RTX 3070 earning $4.66 and the RTX 3080 earning $6.83 a day. The AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT earns $3.61 a day the RX 6800 earns $4.43 a day and the RX 6800 XT and RX 6900 XT earning $5.19 a day.

Ultimately the only CMP that could make a significant dent in the mining demand for next-gen graphics cards based on profitability alone is the 90HX which isn't going to be available for a few months. Not good.

Why cryptomining processors aren't likely to make a difference in graphics card stock

Earlier this month a bunch of smugglers in Hong Kong got a large cache of 30HX CMPs seized by customs officials which is the first time anyone has really seen these cards in the wild. How the smugglers got their hands on the cards is an open question since the cards don't seem to be on sale anywhere.

The only time we saw a CMP for sale was at Microless in the United Arab Emirates which was briefly selling the 30HX for about $723 before the page was taken down. Price gouging on RTX and RX cards is wild right now so you probably can't get an RTX 3060 for its starting MSRP of $329 - and aftermarket cards are a bit pricier if you can find them online - but they aren't more than double their MSRP. And with the ability to unlock the hash rate limiter the RTX 3060 is still much more likely to break even if the price of ETH crashes.

The problem just scales up as you move on to pricier cards. If the 40HX 50HX and 90HX are priced anywhere near proportional to the price of the 30HX we've seen these cards simply aren't going to be either profitable or resellable. At least an RTX 3090 can be resold to desperate gamers on eBay. If the price of ETH crashes no one is going to want to buy a CMP.

The case of the 30HX smuggling ring also doesn't point to its adoption by large scale mining operations that are hoovering up every graphics card on Earth right now. In fact it points to the probability that even large scale miners can't find any graphics cards either and after turning to RTX 3000-series laptops to fill in the gap a few hundred CMPs are better than nothing - especially if they ""fell"" out the back of a shipping container before leaving the port of Hong Kong.

This all points to CMPs not being replacements for RTX cards but last-resort options for miners for large-scale mining operations. That means these will likely be the first cards they swap out once more RTX and RX cards become available.

Ultimately the only way cryptomining stops diverting graphics cards around the world from the gamers they were originally intended for is the way all such things get resolved. The cryptoboom needs to go bust and the price of ETH and BTC needs to tank at which point we'll see an absolute glut of graphics cards on eBay and other sites from miners looking to get whatever they can for the overpriced graphics cards they bought up during the gold rush. Hopefully that will put an end to resellers buying up new stock and maybe give at least some of us a chance to get our hands on one of these cards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9tb2RkZXJzLWZpbmQtYS13YXktdG8tZW5hYmxlLWdwdS12aXJ0dWFsaXphdGlvbi1vbi1nZWZvcmNlLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Modders find a way to enable GPU virtualization on GeForce graphics cards,"GPU virtualization is now available on client NVIDIA graphics cards.

A group of enthusiasts have found a way to enable GPU virtualization for GeForce cards

A feature to artificially segment graphics card resources into multiple virtual instances is currently limited to Grid/Tesla and workstation Quadro GPUs. This functionality is not available to the gaming GeForce series. At least it wasn’t until now. Thanks to a rather simple mod called “vgpu_unlock” this feature has now been enabled on consumer GPUs.

GPU virtualization is a way of distributing graphics card hardware resources virtually to a number of instances. This allows multiple end-users to use the graphics card for a variety of tasks such as 3D modelling or scientific work. However most users should be familiar with this technology thanks to GeForce NOW platform where NVIDIA themselves use GRID GPUs to virtualize multiple environments for gamers.

NVIDIA GPU virtualization Source: VideoCardz

Theoretically it should now be possible to enable a single GeForce RTX 3090 graphics card to power multiple virtual machines and use that for gaming. It would have been an interesting solution to the GPU shortage. Although it has not been tested Internet Cafes could use a single GPU to power multiple machines.

The mod is actually quite simple it tricks the driver into reading a different PCI device ID. Pascal Turing and Ampere cards are being treated as Quadro or Tesla cards. It works on Linux and KVM virtual machine software. While the host machine cannot be Microsoft Windows-based the virtual machines that will be attached to the main system can.

In order to determine if a certain GPU supports the vGPU functionality the driver looks at the PCI device ID. This identifier together with the PCI vendor ID is unique for each type of PCI device. In order to enable vGPU support we need to tell the driver that the PCI device ID of the installed GPU is one of the device IDs used by a vGPU capable GPU.

The list of all currently supported graphics cards has been published in one of the files:

The hash rate limiter on the GeForce RTX 3060 was cracked on many occasions in different ways. The latest limitation to be cracked is the locked GPU virtualization on GeForce cards. The simple mod 'vgpu_unlock' has enabled GPU virtualization on consumer-level cards.

NVIDIA GeForce Cards Can Enable GPU Virtualization With A Simple Mod That Changes The Device ID To A Supported GPU

GPU virtualization is a way of distributing graphics processing power to multiple users essentially allowing multiple users to use a single GPU. This feature is something that differentiates data center GPUs from consumer GPUs. This technology has many use cases including scientific research done by multiple people on a single GPU but the most notable of all is GeForce NOW which uses GRID GPUs to power the virtual gaming experience.

Source: VMware

The silicon was never the issue with vGPU on consumer cards it was the software that locked out the user. Previously to use vGPU users would have to pay a hefty price for an NVIDIA Tesla or Quadro card. vGPU also requires a lot of software to work well and validation with ISVs. NVIDIA's current vGPU software does not support consumer cards but that could be subject to change as GPU passthrough the software that allows a single VM to access a GPU was added to GeForce cards via a driver update.

The mod to get vGPU working is quite simple. It replaces the device ID of an NVIDIA graphics card with a device ID of an officially supported GPU. This works on GP102 GP104 TU102 TU104 and GA102 GPUs for Linux and KVM VM software. It's hard to think of the use case for consumers needing GPU virtualization since this mod doesn't even function with Windows or VMware.

The code for this mod is available on GitHub and it was originally spotted out by Tom's Hardware. It's unfortunate it does not work on Windows because we could have potentially seen consumers do some crypto mining while gaming."

During a conversation with writer and filmmaker Justine Bateman Moss revealed that she was offered a grandmother role ""the day after my 40th birthday"" according to The Hollywood Reporter.

""I had heard that at 40 everything changed. I didn't believe in that because I don't believe in just jumping on a thought system that I don't really align with"" she said. ""But literally the day after my 40th birthday I was reading a script that had come to me and I was talking to my manager about it. She was like 'Oh no no no it's not that role [you're reading for] it's the grandmother.' I may be exaggerating a bit but it happened overnight. I went from being a girl to the mother to beyond the mother.""

Moss now 53 said it was ""brutal"" swallowing that reality especially as older male actors don't face the same hurdles.

""You don't feel like you've aged much and suddenly you're seeing yourself on screen"" she said. ""I would look at these French and European actresses and they just had something about them that felt so confident in their own skin. I couldn't wait to be that. I strive for that. It's not easy being in this business. There's a lot of external pressure.""

The celebrated actress who also appeared in Jessica Jones will be reprising her role as Trinity in The Matrix 4 moderated a conversation on behalf of New York's 92nd Street Y about Bateman's new book. Face: One Square Foot of Skin explores society's response to women as they age and is a follow-up to Bateman's 2018 book Fame: The Hijacking of Reality.

During the chat Bateman said she felt it was ""psychotic"" that conversations about aging turn into discussions about ""cutting up our faces.""

""It's become normalized"" she said about cosmetic surgery. ""Time out time out! This is not a fact. This is an idea that we can either pull in and make a belief or not. I'm like f--k that.""

In the face of criticism about her looks Bateman 55 said she's not about to bend her philosophy. Instead she chooses to look inward and heal her own insecurities rather than responding to hate.

""It does nothing to make me happier or free. It does everything to tamp all that down. It does everything to mute my life. I'm going to do the opposite then I'll have the opposite result"" Bateman said.

Under the name ""Muama Ryoko"" the company UAB Ekomlita from Lithuania sells a special 4G Wifi router. It works similarly to the router you might use in your home to access the Internet. However and you'll notice this at first glance the Muama Ryoko is significantly smaller than a classic Wifi router. The Muama Ryoko is not only supposed to provide fast Internet - you should also be able to take it with you everywhere. Whether you're visiting friends in a café or traveling the Muama Ryoko is your very own personal WiFi router that you can use at any time no matter where you are to access the Internet securely and quickly. At least that's what the provider promises its customers. In addition to the wifi router you also need a SIM card. This is inserted into the router. This gives you control over how much data volume is available to you via the router each month and how much money you spend on this data volume. After all you can decide for yourself which SIM card with which data package you choose from which provider.

Muama Ryoko rating and recommendation

The technology of the Muama Ryoko is already used in many other mobile routers. However most technologically comparable Wifi routers are usually much larger than the Muama Ryoko. Consequently the Muama Ryoko is particularly suitable for taking it everywhere. In addition the device is characterized by the fact that it is 4G/LTE capable. However the 4G Internet connection can only be used if the SIM card you use is also suitable for 4G. According to the provider the Muama Ryoko can be used in 134 countries - which is quite an advantage especially when traveling. Thus you do not have to constantly worry about whether you can use your Wi-Fi router in your vacation or travel destination. However it is still an advantage to always make sure and check on the provider's website whether the destination country is actually supported. With the specified battery life of eight hours you can use the Muama Ryoko for a whole workday. Thus it is not only suitable for surfing in between or for contacting friends and family but also as an alternative to the stationary router at home. Moreover the Muama Ryoko is suitable as such an alternative as you can use the Internet connection with up to ten devices at the same time. Visit the official website to see more customer reviews!

General information about Wifi router

Mobile WiFi routers hardly differ from conventional DSL or WLAN routers in terms of looks alone. The differences between the two router variants lie in the details. DSL routers have a modem that processes the Internet signal from the DSL line. The Internet signal is then transmitted to the end devices such as smartphones tablets or laptops via network connections or wirelessly via WLAN and you as the user can access the Internet. In contrast there are mobile Wi-Fi routers like the Muama Ryoko. They have a SIM card like the one you normally use in your smartphone. The modem of the mobile router therefore accesses the Internet via mobile communication. How fast the Internet connection is on the mobile devices thus always depends on the cellular reception. In the middle of the forest in a dead zone you won't get an Internet signal even with the best mobile WiFi router. Outdated mobile WiFi routers use the 3G standard.

Modern devices like the Muama Ryoko access LTE frequencies - provided your cell phone plan allows it. Since the mobile Wi-Fi routers have their own Wi-Fi they can be used as a hotspot - for example during family outings or conferences where many devices need an Internet connection at the same time. However some Wifi routers can only be used with a limited number of devices at the same time. In the case of the Muama Ryoko a simultaneous connection with ten devices is possible. Unlike DSL routers some mobile Wifi routers can be used wirelessly i.e. without a power connection. They are powered by a battery and thus enable the highest possible flexibility - for example if you do not have a power connection available when traveling and still want to use your Internet access. However it is important that you always make sure that the WiFi router is fully charged.

The mobile WLAN router works completely independently of a domestic connection. This makes them particularly interesting when traveling since they can be taken anywhere - to a hotel train RV or vacation home. You can also use the mobile router in numerous countries. However the frequency bands used differ in some countries. One example is the frequencies used in Canada for which almost all mobile routers sold in Europe are not compatible. Wifi routers from the USA on the other hand rarely work in Europe. Therefore it's important to make sure that your mobile wifi router is actually usable in your destination country before you start your trip. At the same time it may be worthwhile to use a different SIM card in another country that is either cheaper or offers more data volume.

While millions of Americans are still waiting for their third stimulus check — or an extra ""top-up"" payment — some lawmakers and advocates are pushing for a fourth direct payment. And maybe more.

More than 75 members of Congress say that until the pandemic is over there should be regular stimulus checks. President Joe Biden is being urged to wrap them into the $2.3 trillion infrastructure spending plan he's now promoting.

Just a fourth stimulus check could lift more than 7 million people out of poverty according to an analysis from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

But those pulling for more checks are facing considerable resistance. Here’s where things stand on whether you'll get another ""stimmy"" this year.

'Families shouldn't have to worry'

Millions of Americans are still in financial distress with about 4 in 10 saying their income remains below its prepandemic levels according to a recent survey from the credit bureau TransUnion.

Back in January 56 House Democrats led by Minnesota’s Ilhan Omar sent Biden a letter urging him to consider recurring stimulus payments.

“We are experiencing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression with millions of Americans either unemployed forced out of the workforce or facing a decline in hours and wages” the letter said.

And at the end of March 21 Democratic senators joined the chorus of voices calling for more payments. ""Families shouldn’t have to worry about whether they’ll have enough money to pay for essentials in the months ahead"" the senators wrote Biden in a separate letter.

Many households have used stimulus money to cover basic expenses like groceries and rent according to a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics study of how last year's very first checks were spent.

Once those needs were met some of the cash was used for saving and investing the bureau found or for other expenses that may have included buying affordable life insurance. Demand for those policies has surged during the pandemic.

New checks face major obstacles

Support for more stimulus checks is far from universal. Last month the Democrats who control Congress struggled to push through Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID rescue package which provided $1400 stimulus checks and many other benefits.

The bill passed with simple majorities using a streamlined process that required no support from Republicans — who all voted no.

Even moderate members of the Democratic party weren’t in agreement about the need for the third round of payments so there may not be enough political support for further stimulus checks.

Story continues

“I think it’s unlikely at this time” Raymond James analyst Ed Mills tells CNBC.

Another reason not to hold out hope is that the Biden’s administration has turned its focus to other priorities including the massive infrastructure bill. So far the White House hasn't commented on whether relief payments might be included.

But that's looking less and less likely with more Americans getting vaccinated by the day. The stock market is hitting new highs hiring is booming and life appears to be on its way back to normal — lessening the perception of the need for more economic stimulus.

What to do if you need money right now

If you can’t wait for lawmakers to decide whether to send out more stimulus checks and you need cash ASAP you have some options.

Cut the price of your debt. Credit and debit card spending increased in March by 45% compared to the same period last year according to data from the Bank of America. If you’re relying on your credit card you'll soon be dealing with a ton of expensive interest. Rein in your debt — and pay it off more rapidly — by rolling your balances into a lower-interest debt consolidation loan.

Shrink your insurance bills. Car insurance companies have been offering customers discounts as everyone has been driving far less through the pandemic. If your insurer won't negotiate it's time to shop around for a better deal. And while you’re at it you could save hundreds by comparison shopping find a lower price on homeowners insurance.

Stop procrastinating and refinance your mortgage. If you've got a mortgage and haven't tried to compare rates and refinance your loan in the last year you're missing out. The mortgage data and technology provider Black Knight recently said 11.1 million homeowners still have the potential to save an average $277 a month through a refi.

Grow your spare change. A popular app helps you get investing returns quickly using ""spare change"" — it rounds your everyday purchases up to the nearest dollar and drops the difference into an investment account so you can take advantage of the record-shattering stock market.",,,

Lakeland High School students Daniella Gerbasi Sayani Aggarwal and Sabrina Chen received honors.

Daniella a senior won an American Psychological Association Award for outstanding research in psychological science.

Sayani also a senior won an Excellence in Medical Research Award for projects that improve our quality of life and make people healthier.

Sabrina a junior won an Expanding Knowledge in Science Award which goes to students who exhibit excitement and an enthusiasm for discovery.

“I am so proud of these students for their dedication to their research projects” said Lakeland High School science research teacher Stephanie Massey. “They are very deserving of this recognition!”

Walter Panas High School senior Grace Newcombe won the Mu Alpha Theta Award for the use of math in a challenging original thorough and creative investigation. Her research focused on math test anxiety.

“Grace has been a model research student during her four years in the program” said Frank Tamweber the Walter Panas science research teacher. “I am very happy that her hard work and perseverance resulted in this estimable recognition.”

Students felt gratified that their work was recognized.

“Normally within science research students perform research that falls within intense fields like biology and chemistry. However my project focused on music and its effects on the human mind. Music is something I am extremely passionate about so I am undoubtedly honored that my passion and effort have been noticed” Daniella said. “Psychology is intricate and there is still so much unknown about the human mind and how we process emotions and feelings. I am so grateful for this award.”

Grace explained that her project focused on determining if anxiety in math class affected academic performance and if it affected genders differently.

“I modified an already existing questionnaire to help determine participants’ opinions in math class and developed an original math quiz to measure their performance” Grace said. “I completed my research during the COVID-19 pandemic and while it was a challenge I am proud of what I was able to accomplish during this time!”

Sayani said her research used artificial intelligence to make computerized diagnoses of retinopathy from retinal images of diabetic patients. “Winning this award has become a great source of encouragement to me to continue exploring science” she said.

Sabrina said the goal of her research and similar work by other researchers is to develop a therapeutic agent that decreases obesity and insulin resistance. “The research I completed is only one step toward that” she said. “I’m extremely grateful that I could win an award at WESEF and I hope to continue doing research.”

Shortly after we posted about Moderna Inc.’s October 2020 pledge not to enforce its COVID-19-related patents during the pandemic the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency regulatory approval for two COVID-19 vaccines produced by Moderna and BioNTech (with Pfizer) making these groups the first to ever enter the commercial market with mRNA-based therapies. This little-known and never-before-approved mRNA technology has since been widely administered and represents a primary weapon being used to defeat the pandemic.

While this effort carries on market players are confident that COVID-19 is but one of many indications that the mRNA technology platform might be utilized for and that approval of the mRNA vaccines could open the door for the approval of other mRNA-based medicines creating a wide range of new markets.

With the anticipated increase in market activity and competition we will provide an overview of the mRNA IP and competitive landscape in a series of three posts in the context of certain key players’ patent positions drug pipelines strategic relationships and other attributes. These posts are based on publicly available information are non-exhaustive and do not identify all market players or potential market players in this space.

In Part I we will focus on three mRNA companies: Moderna BioNTech and CureVac. In Part II we will focus on Translate BIO Arcturus and eTheRNA and discuss issues surrounding certain lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery technologies. In Part III we will provide a summary of the competitive and IP landscape as covered in the previous posts and offer conclusions.

mRNA Market Players

Moderna

Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ: MRNA) is headquartered in Cambridge MA and as of April 2021 has a market capitalization of over $53 billion.

Along with BioNTech/Pfizer Moderna was one of the first developers to enter the market in December 2020 with an mRNA product its COVID-19 vaccine mRNA-1273. Moderna’s mRNA product pipeline includes 26 drug candidates directed to an array of indications including therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases oncology rare disease autoimmune disease and cardiovascular disease.

According to Moderna’s website it has four mRNA candidates in Phase 2 clinical trials including a cytomegalovirus vaccine personalized cancer vaccine and myocardial ischemia therapy; eight mRNA candidates in Phase 1 clinical trials including for cancer and infectious diseases; and 14 mRNA candidates in preclinical phase for various oncology infectious disease and other indications.

Figure 1: Overview of certain attributes of Moderna as of April 2021

Moderna has indicated it has over 270 issued or allowed U.S. and foreign patents protecting mRNA-based technology with over 600 worldwide pending patent applications. The company has identified at least seven granted U.S. patents that it alleges protect its COVID-19 mRNA-1273 vaccine.

Moderna appears to have sub-licensed foundational mRNA patents from Cellscript LLC based on advancements made by Drs. Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) in the 2000s. The Karikó-Weissman team addressed adverse immune responses to injected synthetic mRNA by replacing the nucleosides uridine and cytidine in the mRNA with pseudouridine and 5-methylcytidineone. Cellscript itself has a sub-license from its affiliate mRNA RiboTherapeutics Inc. which holds an exclusive license from UPenn.

An exemplary patent resulting from this work is U.S. Patent No. 8278036 which has broad claims (e.g. Claim 1: A method for inducing a mammalian cell to produce a protein of interest comprising: contacting said mammalian cell with in vitro-synthesized modified RNA encoding a protein of interest wherein said in vitro-synthesized modified RNA comprises the modified nucleoside pseudouridine) and reportedly may be included in the non-exclusive sublicense granted to Moderna.

Moderna has also reportedly entered into a research collaboration with Harvard University and its website claims to have in-licensed Harvard patents.

With respect to invalidity proceedings Moderna has filed several inter partes reviews (IPRs) including against CureVac’s U.S. Patent No. 8383340 (IPR2017-02194 filed September 29 2017: all claims found unpatentable); Arbutus Biopharma Corporation’s (Arbutus) U.S. Patent No. 9404127 (IPR2018-00680 filed February 21 2018: all claims found unpatentable); Arbutus’ U.S. Patent No. 9364435 (IPR2018-00739 filed March 5 2018: claims 1-6 9 12 14 and 15 found unpatentable); and Arbutus’ U.S Patent No. 8058069 (IPR2019-00554 filed January 9 2019: no challenged claims found unpatentable).

Moderna has also filed oppositions in the European Patent Office (EPO) including against Arbutus’ EP2279254 (Opposition filed April 2018: amended claims corresponding to Auxiliary Request 1 accepted and revocation denied pending appeal by Moderna) and CureVac’s EP2101823 (Opposition filed August 2017: patent revoked pending appeal).

In August 2018 an anonymous third party sought ex parte reexamination for Moderna’s U.S. Patent No. 9872900 with claims directed to an RNA vaccine. Moderna was successful in the reexam (App No. 90/014167) and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued a reexamination certificate indicating “The patentability of claims 1-26 is confirmed.”

There is no record of Moderna being a party to a patent infringement lawsuit before the federal district courts and it has pledged not to enforce its “COVID-19 related patents against those making vaccines intended to combat the pandemic” during the pandemic.

Moderna has entered into several strategic agreements including with Vertex (September 2020 Moderna strategic research collaboration and licensing agreement for the discovery and development of LNPs and mRNAs for the delivery of gene-editing therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis); Merck (January 2015 Master Collaboration and License Agreement for the discovery and development of vaccines and passive immunity treatments against viral diseases using modified mRNA; N.B. in October 2020 Merck ceded back rights to the adult respiratory syncytial virus vaccine the pair had been co-developing); AstraZeneca (a series of strategic agreements relating to the discovery development and commercialization of certain mRNA therapeutic candidates including for a range of cancers); and Lonza Ltd. (May 2020 Global Long Term Agreement “10-year strategic collaboration” to enable larger scale manufacture of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine and future products).

Notably Dr. Karikó who has been mentioned as a potential recipient of the Nobel Prize for her groundbreaking work mentioned above is reportedly a Vice President with BioNTech.

BioNTech

BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX) is headquartered in Mainz Germany and as of April 2021 has a market capitalization of over $27 billion.

Through its collaboration with Pfizer BioNTech was one of the first developers to enter the market in December 2020 with an mRNA product its COVID-19 vaccine BNT162. According to BioNTech’s website its product pipeline includes approximately 15 mRNA candidates directed to oncology influenza COVID-19 HIV tuberculosis rare disease and other indications.

BioNTech’s website also indicates it has one mRNA drug candidate (BNT122) in Phase 2 clinical trials for metastatic melanoma and other solid tumors (in collaboration with Genentech) seven mRNA candidates in Phase 1 clinical trials for various cancers (itself and in separate collaborations with e.g. Genentech and Sanofi) seven mRNA candidates in preclinical phase for various oncology infectious disease and rare disease indications (itself and in separate collaborations with e.g. Pfizer and Genevant).

Figure 2: Overview of certain attributes of BioNTech as of April 2021

BioNTech has stated that its overall worldwide owned and in-licensed patent portfolio includes more than 200 patent families at least 100 of which are solely or jointly owned by BioNTech. The company has described its mRNA patent portfolio as including patents and applications directed to mRNA structures (e.g. for increased immunogenicity) mRNA formulations (e.g. lipolex formulations lipid nanoparticles) mRNA manufacturing (e.g. mRNA purification and production) and mRNA product candidates (directed to various indications including oncology infectious disease rare disease).

Like Moderna BioNTech has reportedly in-licensed foundational mRNA patents based on advancements made by Drs. Karikó and Weissman. An exemplary patent resulting from this work is U.S. Patent No. 8278036 which has broad claims and may be included in the non-exclusive sublicense Cellscript granted to BioNTech.

With respect to invalidity proceedings BioNTech has filed EPO oppositions against Moderna’s EP3492109 (Opposition filed December 2020: proceedings pending); CureVac’s EP3292873 (Opposition filed January 2020: proceedings pending); CureVac’s EP3319622 (Opposition filed November 2020: proceedings pending); CureVac’s EP3173092 (Opposition filed March 2020: proceedings pending); CureVac’s EP3153179 (Opposition filed March 2020: proceedings pending); and CureVac’s EP3116535 (Opposition filed May 2020: proceedings pending). There is no record of BioNTech filing an IPR before the USPTO to date.

Regarding litigation before the U.S. federal courts Allele Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals (Allele) reportedly sued Pfizer and BioNTech (in one suit) and Regeneron (in a separate suit) claiming that the COVID-19 vaccines BNT162 (by BioNTech/Pfizer) and REGN-COV2 (by Regeneron) were each developed using Allele’s “mNeonGreen fluorescent protein” covered under U.S. Patent No. 10221221 without the company’s permission. These cases are pending in the Southern District of California (BioNTech/Pfizer) and the Southern District of New York (Regeneron). Pfizer and BioNTech recently moved to dismiss the complaint against them.

BioNTech has reportedly entered into a number of collaborations including with Pfizer (July 2018 Research Collaboration License Agreement to develop mRNA-based immunotherapies and a March 2020 Collaboration Agreement to develop and manufacture COVID-19 mRNA vaccines); Genentech (September 2016 Collaboration Agreement relating to BioNTech’s iNeST platform in mRNA drug class) Sanofi (November 2015 Collaboration and License Agreement relating to BioNTech’s intratumoral therapy platform in its mRNA drug class) Bayer (May 2016 Agreement relating to mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics for animal health indications); Regeneron (July 2020 strategic collaboration relating to BioNTech’s BNT111 FixVac mRNA oncology product); The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (September 2019 collaboration to develop HIV and tuberculosis programs that includes an initial equity investment of $55 million) and Genevant Sciences GmbH (July 2018 License and Co-Development Agreement under which Genevant licenses Arbutus Biopharma Corporation LNP technology to BioNTech—more on this in Part II ).

CureVac

CureVac NV (NASDAQ: CVAC) is headquartered in Tübingen Germany and as of April 2021 has a market capitalization of over $17 billion.

According to its website CureVac’s pipeline includes four mRNA-based prophylactic vaccines four RNA-based cancer immunotherapies and four protein-based therapies (including for ocular and lung). As of the date of this article CureVac does not have any mRNA products on the market. However its mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate (in collaboration with Bayer) is reportedly in Phase 3 clinical trials.

Per CureVac’s website it has 3 candidates in Phase 1 clinical trials for rabies melanoma and lung cancer (in collaboration with Ludwig Cancer Center and Boehringer Ingelheim) and approximately 10 mRNA candidates in preclinical development or discovery for an array of indications in the areas of oncology infectious diseases and other indications (in collaboration with entities such as GSK Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) CRISPR Therapeutics Genmab Harvard Medical School and Yale University School of Medicine).

Figure 3: Overview of certain attributes of CureVac as of April 2021

CureVac has stated that it is a pioneer in the mRNA space and has built a U.S. and worldwide patent portfolio totaling approximately 700 issued patents including over 60 issued U.S. patents over 50 issued European patents and over 150 issued patents in other countries with hundreds of worldwide patent applications pending. CureVac has also indicated these patents include claims relating to its mRNA technology platform including its “RNAoptimizer technology platform CV8102 BI 1361849 (former CV9202) CV7202 CV-SSIV our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and our CVCM delivery system.” The company also claims that its patents and applications are “the most cited among mRNA companies’ intellectual property.”

With respect to invalidity proceedings CureVac has filed EPO oppositions against UPenn’s EP2528626 (Opposition filed June 2017: patent revoked). There is no record of CureVac filing an IPR before the USPTO. Defensively CureVac’s patents have been the subject of numerous attacks before the EPO including by BioNTech Moderna and eTheRNA as stated herein and in the forthcoming posts as well as others including: EP1797886 (April 9 2020 Opposition filed by Gerhard Weinzierl; April 14 2020 Opposition filed by Koenig Szynka Tilmann Von Renesse); EP2680881 (December 18 2017 Opposition filed by Strawman Ltd.); EP2680880 (December 18 2017 Opposition filed by Strawman Ltd.); EP3326641 (Four Oppositions filed in Finland on April 28 2020 by Dr. Martin Grund Rainer Friedrich Pfizer Inc. and Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.; Four Oppositions filed in EP by Dr. Martin Grund on March 26 2020 Rainer Friedrich on April 17 2020 Pfizer Inc. on March 26 2020 and Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. on March 24 2020). Europe does not require the actual opponent party in interest to be disclosed therefore any of the market players could be behind these oppositions while using “Strawman Ltd.” for example.

CureVac has reportedly partnered with third parties in connection with mRNA technology including Novartis (March 2021 initial agreement for manufacturing of CureVac’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate CVnCoV); Bayer (January 2021 collaboration and services agreement for the development and supply of CureVac’s CVnCoV candidate); GlaxoSmithKline (July 2020 Collaboration and License Agreement to research develop and commercialize CureVac’s prophylactic and therapeutic non-replicating mRNA-based vaccines targeting infectious diseases); Genmab (December 2019 Collaboration and License Agreement for the development of mRNA-based antibody therapeutics); CRISPR Therapeutics (November 2017 Development and License Agreement for developing CRISPR-based therapeutics in select disease areas and novel Cas9 mRNA constructs with improved properties for gene editing applications); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (February 2015 Global Access Commitments Agreement to develop prophylactic vaccines based on CureVac’s mRNA platform and $52+ million in funding from the foundation) and Boehringer Ingelheim (August 2014 Exclusive Collaboration and License Agreement to develop next generation lung cancer immunotherapy with CureVac’s CV9202).

With respect to LNP delivery technology CureVac has reportedly entered into agreements with Arcturus Therapeutics (January 2018 Development and Option Agreement that provides CureVac with access to Arcturus’s LNP formulation technology for use in CureVac’s mRNA technology); and Acuitas (April 2016 Development and Option Agreement that provides CureVac access to Acuitas’s LNP formulation technology that is used in combination with CureVac’s mRNA technology). More on these entities and LNP technology will be provided in Part II .

In Part II we will discuss Translate BIO Arcturus eTheRNA and certain issues relating to Arbutus’ LNP delivery technology.

Two of those finalists have been selected to represent Hudson County at the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair: Ashita Birla (10th grade) of of McNair Academic High School in Jersey City and Rebeca Fernando (11th grade) of Jose Marti STEM Academy in Union City.

The other high school gold medalists in the 2021 Jersey City Medical Center/RWJBarnabas Health STEM Showcase are: Neil Kadian Ahmed Mahmud and Patricia Okoye of McNair Academic High School; and Dahlia Diaz Harshni Patel Ashly Rivas Ramzi Saber and Zoe Weng of Jose Marti STEM Academy.

Birla’s project “Transforming Telemedicine: Engineering Thermoelectric Health Check System” is a green energy remote health check system that focuses on the new demands and practices of healthcare systems during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Birla also wanted to be able to detect medical problems and COVID-19 at an early stage and provide reliable monitoring for the elderly.

“Due to risk of infection many people are scared and reluctant to visit healthcare facilities in person for even day-to-day problems and check-ups” she says. “I felt that telemedicine should allow patients to be as self-sufficient and healthy as possible from home and provide a cost-effective and safe alternative to in-person doctor visits. This not only keeps the community safe but also ensures that the healthcare staff stay away from infection or impact.”

Fernando’s project “Comparing the Efficacy of Frequently Used Dietary Fibers vs. Acacia Arabic” came about due to her her experiences with several people in her life who suffer from constipation.

Fernando found that people who use over-the-counter enemas and laxatives which aren’t natural have side effects like bloating and stomach cramps.

“There are natural ways for treating constipation such as using dietary fibers like Psyllium Husk and Guar Gum” she says. “In this project we introduce Acacia Arabica (Gum Arabic) a natural fiber found in South Asia which has properties that help alleviate constipation. It carries no side effects and is little to no cost.”

The Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair will be held via video conferencing this year due to the pandemic. It will take place in May with Birla and Fernando competing against students from around the world for awards that go up to a $75000 top prize.

NJCU recently announced that it will offer full four-year scholarships to Birla Fernando and Hudson’s other high school gold medalists.

Jersey City Medical Center will hold a virtual awards presentation in April. School districts will be notified so that students and their families may tune in to celebrate.

Michael Prilutsky president and CEO of Jersey City Medical Center noted that against the backdrop of the current pandemic the need for young minds to explore STEM professions is crucial.

“The past year has highlighted the necessity and urgency of scientific research and innovation” he said. “Jersey City Medical Center and RWJBarnabas Health remain committed to supporting intellectual creativity through our longtime leadership role in the STEM Showcase. Congratulations to students and teachers who modified so successfully their research projects and presentations to this year’s virtual format.”

During the virtually conducted showcase last month independent research projects were evaluated over a period of 12 days followed by a second round of “Super Judging.” Carla Hollis JCMC’s chief operating officer and Dr. Michael Loftus chief medical officer were members of the team charged with selecting the students to represent Hudson County at the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair.

Making production facilities and intralogistics more flexible autonomous and efficient requires appropriate communication networks and comprehensive connectivity. The new 5G mobile network communication standard is opening up new prospects in this area. One of the benefits of 5G is the significantly greater bandwidth that allows much more data to be transmitted much faster than previously. Estimates start at ten gigabits per second which is about 10 times more than with 4G. In addition 5G will have a substantially lower latency and greater reliability than current mobile network technologies.

The last few years were pivotal years for 5G as mobile network operators (MNO)/communication service providers (CSPs) network infrastructure vendors software vendors system integrators and industrial enterprises began to stake their claim in the technology. Industrial companies that deployed private LTE and/or non-standalone (NSA) 5G networks for test cases or trail purposes have already started to realize the benefits of 5G.

Network operators are increasingly seeking ways to grow revenue and cut costs in a low-growth environment which is made more complicated by the demanding requirements of 5G services including high speed low latency and reliability. Network operators therefore need to evolve their networks offerings with new automation and technologies such as virtual radio access network (RAN) edge networking and network automation to meet the demands of the 5G era. Also some global network operators have started diversifying their revenue streams by tapping new business models such as service offerings related to pay TV media entertainment advertising consumer manufacturing and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to seek growth beyond core telecoms services.

5G technology is still evolving with each new specification release. As more tangible use cases are deployed more users will appreciate the benefits of 5G. Awareness and knowledge of 5G are gaining momentum in the global market. However there is wide variation across the globe in terms of intentions to upgrade to 5G and the willingness to pay more for it.

Operators and industrial enterprises require access to sufficient radio spectrum in suitable frequencies in the sub-1 GHz frequency bands and 5G mid and high or millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. Spectrums for private use by enterprise companies are auctioned in some countries such as China France Germany Japan and the US. The evolving global ecosystem includes network operators infrastructure vendors operation technology (OT) companies semiconductor manufacturers software vendors cloud providers system integrators technology associations and industrial user companies. In general the ecosystem aims to develop associated standards technology architectures equipment chipsets end-devices software and services that take advantage of 5G technology.

ARC Advisory Group’s Report on Industrial Private Networks

According to ARC Advisory Group’s recently published report Industrial Private Networks (4G/LTE & 5G) the deployment of private mobile networks has witnessed double-digit growth and has become an important market. Many enterprise users have deployed private LTE networks and laid road maps for adapting 5G standalone (SA) networks. We believe that this growth trend will continue for at least the next 5 years.

Looking at process and discrete manufacturing side the demand for private LTE and/or 5G networks will be driven by the need for data and speed for connecting equipment assets systems and production operations to perform analytics and transform manufacturing/production processes and increase efficiency. Critical applications that will drive demand for private networks include remote operations and monitoring of process control and SCADA systems and assets; end-point metering in gas electricity and water industries; asset or equipment tracking in mining applications; mobile robots and automated guided vehicles (AGV) employed on manufacturing shop floors; augmented reality; remote access; maintenance; and such other applications that enable mobile and remote workforces.

""I can't say when obviously I can't divulge my wife's secrets"" Rollins said. ""That's bad for me. I gotta be home with her every day so I wouldn't wanna upset her. But now she's doing great. Obviously four months postpartum and she's making incredible strides in her recovery.

""And I suggest you'll have some sorta update from her sooner than later about when she may return. But she may not. She just surprises. Because she's full of surprises. So who knows? But either way she's doing great She's healthy baby's healthy. She will be back sooner or later.""

Serenade of the Seas was dispatched to assist residents of the island and we have our first look at the ship's efforts to help.

Royal Caribbean International President and CEO Michael Bayley shared photos of Serenade in St. Vincent following the eruption Friday of La Soufrière.

This is the first time La Soufrière has erupted since 1979 which as covered homes and the countryside in ash along with a strong sulfur smell.

Mr. Bayley praised the efforts of his crew in assisting ""Love and huge respect to our crew who as always come together in unimaginable ways. Over the next few days they’ll be welcoming guests preparing provisions and providing medical attention.""

""I am so proud of our team and all the teams behind the scenes from Royal Celebrity and Carnival Cruises working day and night to make sure we assist the people of St.Vincent in any way we can.""

In addition to Serenade of the Seas Celebrity Cruises’ Celebrity Reflection is also helping out from the Royal Caribbean Group.

Carnival Cruise Line sent Carnival Legend and Carnival Paradise to assist in the efforts.

The cruise ships are ready to take evacuees to nearby islands.

Serenade of the Seas will not be able to handle as many evacuees as normal due to the fact the ship is minimally staffed due to the global health crisis.

Royal Caribbean also confirmed it is evacuating anyone not just vaccinated people.

Mr. Bayley confirmed they would evacuate all people that can pass a Covid test ""We have stated that all passengers to be evacuated will need a negative Covid test.""

As a result of the cruise industry being shutdown the ship is is at ""minimum manning"" meaning there is just enough crew to keep the ship functional.

The Associated Press reports about 16000 people have had to flee their ash-covered communities after the volcano erupted.

While Royal Caribbean International did look at other locations for the ship’s first cruise Israel’s determination to vaccinate its entire population was a major draw. Likewise the travel corridor established between Israel and Cyprus and Greece means cruising the Eastern Mediterranean is far easier to organize than in other parts of the world during the pandemic.

“Thanks to the millions of vaccines we have brought I am proud that Israel will be the first country in the world to launch Royal Caribbean’s new flagship” said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . “Royal Caribbean’s decision to come to Israel is a significant expression of confidence in our policy. This is an important economic touristic moment for the State of Israel.”

The cruises are only for fully vaccinated Israeli adults and children with a negative PCR test. All crew members are vaccinated.

Royal Caribbean teamed up with Norwegian Cruise Line to establish a panel of health experts including epidemiologists. That team created protocols that include 74 recommendations for a return to healthy sailing. Royal Caribbean implemented many of those proposals when it resumed sailing from Singapore at the end of 2020.

“Sailing from Israel is an opportunity we have had our sights on for quite some time” said Royal Caribbean International president and CEO Michael Bayley. “We greatly appreciate the government of Israel for their collaboration and confidence in us to deliver memorable cruise experiences to their residents and look forward to delivering on that promise aboard our newest ship the first [COVID-free] ‘green island’ at sea.”

Royal Caribbean hopes some 70000 Israelis will take to the seas from Haifa during this initial season with the first passengers setting off on a two-day jaunt to Cyprus on June 2.

The Odyssey will dock at Limassol Cyprus and at Athens Greece and pay visits to Greek islands including Rhodes Santorini and Mykonos during two-to-seven-day cruises.

The ship is something to behold: a city on the sea with all the amenities you could want and more and that includes services for the kosher traveler. Part of the main dining room will be fully kosher with another restaurant also offering kosher cuisine as part of the all-inclusive package. There will also be kosher snacks around the ship and synagogues according to demand.

“We’re going to have a rabbi bless the kitchens” the cruise line’s EMEA vice-president Ben Bouldin told the travel edition of The Jerusalem Post’s podcast. The company has tried to think of everything for the religious traveler including electric Shabbat candles because naked flames are “a bit of a no-no” on board.

There will be Hebrew-speaking staff and guest services and announcements will be made in Hebrew in addition to English.

All passengers will enjoy balcony staterooms on the initial sailings. The company is limiting traveler numbers to ensure a COVID-safe atmosphere. The ship will sail at around one-third of its 5500-passenger capacity. That means everyone gets a room with a view.

The Odyssey offers truly international cuisine beyond the inclusive dining experience. Restaurants include Teppanyaki serving East Asian flavors in a traditional Japanese style and Giovanni’s Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar. If you like beverages from the old country there’s a Starbucks and an English pub along with a host of other eateries and bars.

The upper deck is a paradise for kids and parents alike. It features two open-air resort-style pools and four whirlpools with shady casitas and hammocks. There’s also a FlowRider surf simulator skydiving in the North Star all-glass observation capsule that boasts 360-degree views from 300 feet above sea level and robot bartenders at the Bionic Bar.

The ship boasts bumper cars a five-aside soccer court a teen lounge and lots of entertainment for the little ones in English and Hebrew. The theaters will host shows while Israeli DJs and Greek bands bring a local touch to proceedings.

“It’s going to be the newest and most incredible cruise ship to grace the Earth this year” said Bouldin. “We think it’s really an opportunity to put cruises back on the map and I’m excited that it’s happening in this region.”

There are sailings throughout the summer with prices from $493.

You're likely to end up a loser!,"Tony Hetherington is Financial Mail on Sunday's ace investigator fighting readers corners revealing the truth that lies behind closed doors and winning victories for those who have been left out-of-pocket. Find out how to contact him below.

J.S. writes: I have been invited to join the Winners Circle a multi-level marketing company. It seems you earn an income from recruiting other people and also from currency trading signals they send daily. However I can find no address for the company. Is this a legitimate way to earn extra money?

Winners Circle is not legitimate. It is not even a company. It is nothing more than a name used to suck people into the clutches of a dodgy American business called IM Academy which advertises training courses on how to make money by trading on the foreign exchange markets.

'Winners Circle is not legitimate. It is not even a company' says Tony Hetherington

British-based Winners Circle was set up by two experienced MLM (multi-level marketing) operators Simon Brookes and Roger Garth with slogans like: 'Winning at forex is easier than you think. Just follow our system.'

Recruiting material signed by Garth tells recruits that the Winners Circle receives tips from professional forex traders: 'When they identify a trade that they believe will be profitable they send it to you via a mobile phone app; you then follow the instructions given to place the trade including what to buy or sell.'

In a YouTube video Brookes claims the scheme 'is a licence to print money'. He then hands over to Garth who talks about the trading signals they issue to their members assuring them that 'some have all the information you need to trade even if you are a complete newbie'.

The tips on which currencies to trade come from IM Academy. According to Garth: 'Simon and I will continue to analyse every signal sent by IM.' And he pledges: 'We will only send signals we are prepared to put our own money into.'

Now I cannot question Garth about any of this as he died recently. But Winners Circle is continuing under Brookes who told me that members pay $234 (about £170) to join followed by $174 a month.

The joining fee goes to IM Academy but a big slice of the monthly fee goes to the recruiter so Brookes gets a major share of payments made by his recruits. This is how MLM works.

Denial: Boss Simon Brookes says Winners Circle 'doesn't give advice'

The big question is whether all this is legal. I do not believe it is. Telling people how to invest is educational and needs nobody's permission.

But telling them what to buy and sell is financial advice pure and simple and anyone offering this service has to be vetted and authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority or they could face up to two years in prison. Despite all the written claims and the video evidence Brookes insisted to me that he needed no FCA approval saying: 'We are only an educational opportunity and we never give any advice.'

So what about the trading signals and the mobile phone messages telling members what to buy and sell?

According to Brookes this does not count as advice because it is up to Winners Circle members to decide whether to invest. Of course the same could be said of any genuine stockbroker who gave a share recommendation to a client but the broker still has to be authorised by the FCA.

IM Academy and the company behind it New York-based International Markets Live are well known to financial watchdogs.

Regulators in Spain Belgium and France have issued public warnings about them. And in 2018 the Commodity Futures Trading Commission fined the company $150000 for operating an unlicensed scheme which let investors 'mirror' forex trades made by its own traders.

Our own Financial Conduct Authority is well aware of International Markets Live. It warned investors three years ago to stay away from it as it is completely unauthorised.

So what does it think of Winners Circle? A few days ago the FCA told me: 'Where new information comes to light we will always take this into account when dealing with reports of unauthorised business activity.'

Well so much for the FCA's 2018 alert. But now it knows that a British-based bunch is actively recruiting for the very service it warned against will it do anything stronger than simply posting yet another warning on its website?

The FCA long ago lost sight of the fact that it was created to protect consumers from financial harm. It now prefers to devote time and energy to areas such as monitoring 'diversity' in the financial sector. Here is a chance for it to take real action but I am not holding my breath.

Your refund is finally sailing home K.N. writes: My wife and I booked through Planet Cruise to go on Royal Caribbean International's ship Jewel of the Seas. We paid for this in January last year and were due to sail in June last year but due to Covid RCI cancelled the cruise. I have been chasing Planet Cruise for my cash ever since. I do not want a credit for a future cruise as at age 74 there would be too much uncertainty. Planet Cruise did not deny that you were entitled to a refund. Its chief executive Richard Downs told me: 'Often we are waiting for funds to be transferred to us by third party suppliers before we can refund the consumer. 'Additionally each cruise line airline accommodation provider and land tour operator has its own set of rules in relation to any cancellations refunds and credits.' Staff have now been transferred from other work to speed up customer enquiries and refund claims. Planet Cruise has transferred £4354 to your bank account and the original deposit of £400 which you paid by credit card has been transferred back to your card account.

Why did Lloyds hold on to my £700?

Ms C.N. writes: We were due to fly to Florida with Virgin Holidays but this was cancelled due to the pandemic. Virgin refunded the holiday cost some months ago but the initial deposit of £700 is still owed. Virgin says it returned the money to my Lloyds account but Lloyds says it has not received it.

After I contacted Virgin staff there called you to say that the missing £700 had been sent to Lloyds but had bounced back.

And Lloyds said that so much time had passed since you paid the deposit in 2019 that the refund had not been recognised when it was returned.

Apparently the system does not cope well if more than 365 days separate the original payment and the refund. Virgin has sent the payment again so you now have your £700.

Lloyds says it could have done better at handling your repeated enquiries about the missing money – and has therefore added £75 to the total by way of saying sorry.

If you believe you are the victim of financial wrongdoing write to Tony Hetherington at Financial Mail 2 Derry Street London W8 5TS or email tony.hetherington@mailonsunday.co.uk.

Because of the high volume of enquiries personal replies cannot be given. Please send only copies of original documents which we regret cannot be returned.",,,,,,

Photos of destroyed Russian S-300V SAM launchers have been released

Photos of destroyed S-300V SAM launchers of the Russian invaders in the Zaporizhzhia region have been posted online.

The Telegram channel War in Ukraine. Equipment losses published the photo.

As noted elements of the Russian air defense systems were destroyed on the temporarily occupied territory last February.

Preliminarily these were the 9A83M2 launcher and the 9A85-2 launcher-loader of the 9K81M2 S-300V4 system.

The photo captures the powerful burning of two vehicles and parts of transport and launch containers scattered around.

The exact location of the Russian air defense system position and what caused their destruction is currently unknown.

Presumably the SAM systems were hit by the long-range firepower of the Ukrainian Defense Forces possibly by a precision strike from M142 HIMARS which regularly destroys enemy air defense systems.

S-300V air defense system

The S-300V is an air defense system for the ground forces that started to enter service in 1983 under the name S-300V1. All elements of the SAM are self-propelled and mounted on tracked chassis.

S-300V1 air defense system

The system is designed to defend important state military and industrial facilities as well as troop groups against aircraft ballistic and tactical missiles using two types of anti-aircraft missiles.

As a result of the deep modernization of the S-300V the Russian Federation has developed the S-300VM Antey-2500 modification armed with new anti-aircraft guided missiles with an increased range and improved other characteristics.

Last year the drones of Ukrainian special forces neutralized the Russian S-300VM air defense system.

Ukrainian artillery also destroyed elements of the S-300V air defense system in the enemy’s rear in the Kherson region.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy90b20tYnJhZHktYXBwZWFycy1hbmdyeS1qZWZmLXJvc3Mtcm9iZXJ0LWtyYWZ0LWpva2UtbmV0ZmxpeC1yb2FzdNIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy90b20tYnJhZHktYXBwZWFycy1hbmdyeS1qZWZmLXJvc3Mtcm9iZXJ0LWtyYWZ0LWpva2UtbmV0ZmxpeC1yb2FzdC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tom Brady appears angry with Jeff Ross' Robert Kraft joke during Netflix roast: 'Don't say that s--- again',"Tom Brady knew that everything was on the table for his live Netflix roast on Sunday night including the ending of his marriage to Gisele Bündchen.

But when ""roast master"" Jeff Ross said a joke about New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft Brady seemed quick to shut it down.

During Ross’s joke presentation he mentioned Brady being taken 199th overall in the NFL Draft and he said he walked into Kraft’s office to tell him something.

""’I’m the best decision your organization has ever made’"" Ross said.

But Ross wasn’t done.

""’Would you like a massage?’"" he said.

PATRIOTS' JEROD MAYO DOUBTS TOM BRADY WANTS TO PLAY QUARTERBACK FOR HIS OLD TEAM

WARNING: VIDEO BELOW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE

The Los Angeles Forum was a mixture of laughs and groans as Ross poked fun at a serious charge that Kraft had faced in early 2019.

In February 2019 Kraft was charged in a multicounty investigation of massage parlors that included a secret video recording in the spas’ lobbies and rooms. Police said the recordings showed Kraft and other men engaging in sex acts with women and paying them.

Kraft would plead not guilty to the charge issued a public apology in March 2019 and would be cleared of a soliciting sex charge in 2020.

Brady turned toward Ross once the joke was said and as Ross looked over at Kraft in the crowd Brady came into frame and tried to whisper something to Ross. But it was caught by a microphone.

""Don’t say that s--- again"" he said quickly to Ross who acknowledged it with a laugh.

“I made a boo-boo” Jeffrey S. McConney admitted when describing the erroneous math he scribbled on “TRUMP” corporate letterhead.

The former Trump Organization controller testified about the notes he took during a January 2017 meeting that laid out how the family real estate company was going to surreptitiously reimburse attorney Michael Cohen for fronting the $130000 that silenced the porn star Stormy Daniels. That payment kept her from going public about her decade-old one-night stand with Trump in the days before the 2016 presidential election.

The farce was laid out in black and white with handwritten notes explaining the fuzzy math at play.

Cohen would be paid $180000 which was doubled on paper so that it would make up for the roughly 50 percent taxes the Midtown Manhattan resident would have to pay in federal state and city taxes. McConney wrote “180000 x 2 for taxes” in black pen on the bright white paper. On the witness stand he admitted the company was fine having it “grossed up” to ensure Cohen got his proper share.

The sham continued when tallying up Cohen’s bonus. Initially $50000 was marked as “paid to Red Finch for tech services” but that seemed to morph instead to mean $60000 for Cohen himself.

“Michael was complaining that his bonus wasn’t large enough. This was to make up for whatever he thought he was owed” McConney testified.

The total $420000 was then divided by 12 so that Cohen would get $35000 each month for a year. McConney’s notes of that meeting included a mention that stated “Mike to invoice us” the genesis of what prosecutors say would later be Cohen invoices for fake legal work that Trump gladly paid to keep the hush money deal under wraps.

Monday’s testimony also connected Trump directly to the process a major step forward in the case. Prosecutors showed jurors a copy of a March 28 2017 email in which McConney wrote “I’ll check status tomorrow. DJT needs to sign check.”

On the stand McConney explained that authorizing the money transfers would require having someone actually go to the White House have the then-president of the United States approve the payment himself—while he was president.

But in an instance that exemplifies the lack of intellectual rigor involved in this operation at least one of those checks disappeared on its way back north from Washington to New York City.

After three monthly payments to Cohen in January February and March McConney asked an employee in the Trump Organization accounting department Deborah Tarasoff to cancel a check cut in April that didn’t return.

“It looks like we never got a check back from the White House. It got lost somebody couldn’t find it. I guess it’s the same as lost” he testified.

Paperwork showed that after $105000 was paid by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust the bean counters back in Manhattan realized it would be easier to run the next $315000 in payments through Trump’s personal accounts for the rest of the year.

Matt Colangelo a prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office meticulously went through each of Cohen’s 12 invoices. Every month in 2017 Cohen would email Allen Weisselberg a disgraced accountant who was then the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer but has since been convicted of tax fraud and spent three months at New York’s dreaded Rikers Island jail. Cohen would deliver a curt greeting—mentioning some summer fun a hurricane hitting Weisselberg’s Florida home Thanksgiving the winter holidays—then get right down to business.

“Pursuant to the retainer agreement kindly remit payment for services rendered” Cohen would email Weisselberg each time proudly signing his emails: “Michael D. Cohen Esq. Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.”

One by one Colangelo went over every monthly email attached invoice forwarded Weisselberg email and McConney’s copy over to Tarasoff. By the time they got to September McConney was starting to wear down.

“$35000” he said sounding increasingly tired of answering why he knew how much to pay despite there not being any dollar figure on the invoice for supposed legal work. The answer was always the same: that first meeting in January 2017.

“It’s an invoice from Michael Cohen” he groaned when discussing the October paperwork.

When Colangelo asked him to read the email McConney let out a mild whine. “The whole thing?” he asked.

“Why don’t we just do the body this time” Colangelo acquiesced.

The internal Trump corporate emails showed how invoices made their way from Cohen to Weisselberg to McConney to Tarasoff. And the chain would generally end the same way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDYvYXJ0cy9kZXNpZ24vaGFtbWVyLW11c2V1bS1hbm4tcGhpbGJpbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Who's Who of L.A.'s Art World Bids Farewell to a Champion,"The actor Owen Wilson chatted with the artist Ed Ruscha.

Buffington,"LEWISTON – William S. Buffington 81 of South Paris passed away on Monday April 29 2024 from a life well-lived at Central Maine Medical Center. He was born May 22 1942 in Colebrook N.H. to Elmer and Leora (Marsh) Buffington. Willie was the second of five children.

Willie met the love of his life Crystal while working construction in Gorham Maine. They married in 1966 and resided in the Norway-Paris area. Willie got a job at C. B. Cummings until he started hauling house trailers in 1972 for Hardy’s and then Dick Webber at Northeast Housing. He started and opened his first business Willie’s Repair in 1978. This business is still family operated and supporting 3rd generation family. Retirement was driving him crazy so Willie and Crystal built and opened self storage units. Willie also started Willie’s Enterprises which included tractor work snow plowing and hauling gravel. Willie continued to volunteer at the Paris Fire Department and stayed busy and productive right up to the end.

During his younger years Willie spent a lot of time at Oxford Plains Speedway. He had 68 wins and earned 4-track championships in the figure-8 division. He even managed to win one of the crazy enduros. He earned the nickname “Captain Crunch” over the years and added a lot of fans and lifelong friendships during his 20 plus years of racing.

Willie joined the South Paris Fire Department in 1966. He volunteered for over 57 years rising to the rank of Deputy Chief. Willie always gave his all in all situations. He would be the first to respond and the last to leave. He led by example and never hesitated to step in and help. He was instrumental in fundraising for the department coordinating “boot” drives raffles and the food shack at the fair.

Willie is survived by his wife of 57 years Crystal (Fothergill) Buffington. She helped him navigate everything through out the years; his son Christopher Scott Buffington and his wife April of Paris; his daughter Angela Buffington of Lewiston; grandsons Brandon Nicholas and Matthew all of Paris; bonus grandson Ryan Thomas and his partner Rya of Norway; great-grandchildren Charlotte and Marlee Buffington; special sisters-in-law Sharon Tate of Florida and Cheryl Coffman of Buckfield; brother James Buffington of Tennessee; sisters Eleanor and Floyd Ricker of Kentucky and Alberta Flanders of New Hampshire; and many special nieces and nephews.

He was predeceased by his parents; and an older brother Robert of Tennessee.

Confluent's platform can access and process data on the fly allowing it to analyze and act upon the likes of sales information and customer feedback in real-time.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

For example Walmart uses Confluent to track inventory so customers know immediately what's in stock at a store or online. Before Confluent Walmart would track inventory in batches at the beginning or end of a day so there was less visibility for customers into what was in stock which could cause frustrations like shipping delays.

The technology is based on Apache Kafka an open source project that the company's founders started when they were at LinkedIn and those roots mean that Confluent has built a strong developer userbase Buscemi told Insider in March.

Even though Amazon Web Services launched a competing service in late 2018 Confluent is still attracting attention: It raised a $250 million Series E round announced last April led by Coatue Management with participation from Altimeter Capital and Franklin Templeton and existing investors at a $4.5 billion valuation.

While the firm declined to comment on its IPO plans following a report from The Information in March that it was on the path to go public it has made some notable additions to its leadership team recently in addition to Buscemi: In June Confluent hired financial officer Steffan Tomlinson a former Google Cloud exec who also previously led public debuts at Palo Alto Networks and Aruba Networks. More recently it hired former Google executive Cory Scott as its first chief information security officer (CISO) and former Adaptive Insights executive Melanie Vinson as chief legal officer.

Here's why Buscemi decided joining the startup was a good move after Salesforce:

Confluent's massive opportunity ahead

Buscemi said she understands the appeal of Confluent's software because of her time at Salesforce where she realized the importance of data to unlock business value. Companies that aren't able to connect data between different applications can't glean as many insights out of it as firms that do she said.

""If you do not have access to the data — and not just access to the data but the ability to capture the events that are happening in real-time with it — you're tapping into only a fraction of the value of the data and what it can do"" Buscemi said.

Her goal is to help Confluent expand beyond its developer roots to reach C-level executives and help them understand how its products can improve their businesses.

""The company is now at an inflection point where it's hitting a hyper-scale and going from what I would call from developer to C-level"" she told Insider.

Every industry can use Confluent she said and that's part of what she'll be helping to communicate in her role as marketing chief.

For example ridesharing apps like Uber needs to be able to order someone a ride and send the address and payment details to a back end system in real time. Uber uses the technology to run their ridesharing platform.

She plans to use examples like that to grow Confluent's influence and awareness about the product. In addition to focusing on outreach to business leaders she plans to continue growing the developer outreach program Confluent already has.

""Confluent to me it's solving one of the biggest challenges I've been hearing from executives for seven years now"" Buscemi said. ""This real-time conundrum: access to data and the movement of data.""

It's been four months since salesforce.com (CRM 0.72%) announced that it's acquiring Slack (WORK) but the transaction hasn't been completed yet. Should shareholders of the messaging platform continue to hold or does it make more sense to sell and move on? As with many things in investing it depends. On a Fool Live episode recorded on March 17 Fool contributors Brian Stoffel and Brian Withers discuss what investors should be considering to make their decision.

10 stocks we like better than Slack Technologies

When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Slack Technologies wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of February 24 2021

Brian Withers: Let me jump into Slack. Slack's a pretty popular rec [recomendation]. I imagine not as many people own it anymore. But I don't know that everybody goes back and un-favorites stocks that they don't [laughs] own anymore. But there's really not a lot going on with Slack but I did want to give viewers a quick little insight.

Earnings was pretty decent revenue was $903 million for full-year 2020 so they're approaching a $1 billion run rate business it's up 43% Q4 was up 38% so pretty strong. Billings are up 41% showing me that customers are still signing up for Slack even though everybody knows that Salesforce is going to buy them that isn't slowing growth at all. Had a GAAP loss of 29% but a positive cash flow from operations including [that] it spent $8.7 million in the quarter from a transaction expense related to the acquisition.

I think the question everybody is asking is should I hold my stock? I am going to put this in the chat. The acquisition closing price will be $26.79 plus 0.0776 times the Salesforce stock price. I did the math on this yesterday. The current buyout price is 43 bucks and Slack was trading around 40 bucks. If you wait around you will get another three bucks if you want to put your money to work and you have long-term capital gains that's another way to play it as well. But the only thing I would caution is if you have short-term capital gains and you're close to that one-year mark I might wait a little bit of time for that to flip over but we're not tax advisors here.

Brian Stoffel: Brian just about Slack in general do you own the stock first?

Withers: I did I sold after the acquisition [was announced].

Stoffel: Was that because its stock itself couldn't go anywhere did it have to do with your feelings about Salesforce? Because really at this point we're asking people how do you feel about Salesforce correct?

Withers: Well it's not even really a Salesforce question because you're only getting for every one share of Slack stock [laughs] you're getting 7% of a share of Salesforce. You have to have a lot of shares to make it worthwhile. If you had 100 bucks of Slack you'd only get $7 worth of Salesforce stock. I don't know that that's worth hanging around for. If you want to buy Salesforce just go ahead and buy them.

But yeah for me there was a cap on where that stock could grow and when the new stock year came around and my tax situation went to fiscal 2021 I sold and reinvested in another player that has more long-term growth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9lbnRlcnByaXNlLWxldmVsLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwcy1zZW5kLXZlY2hhaW4tdmV0LXByaWNlLXRvLW5ldy1oaWdoc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Enterprise-level partnerships send VeChain (VET) price to new highs,"Real-world partnerships and integrations into thriving industries are some of the best forms of validation for blockchain projects that are seeking long-term sustainability and widespread adoption. They also have the ability to spark rallies that trigger long-term price appreciation as brand awareness spreads.

Since February enterprise-level adoption and a wide array of use cases have worked in favor of VeChain (VET) a blockchain-powered supply chain platform that seeks to use distributed governance and Internet of Things (IoT) technology to optimize supply chain management systems.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that the price of VET has increased more than 400% over the past two months climbing from a low of $0.0263 on Feb. 8 to a new record high at $0.1344 on April 9

Major collaborations ignite VeChain price

A scroll through the project’s Twitter feed shows that VET's price growth in 2021 has largely been stimulated by the adoption of its supply chain tracking technology. On April 8 the team announced a collaboration with the software company Salesforce.

We're pleased to have worked with Daniel Nortje Director of Strategy & Architecture at @Salesforce.



Daniel has chosen VeChain as the blockchain of choice in a sample enterprise adoption case & successfully connected #VeChain ToolChain with Salesforce!https://t.co/YtZIG6Lx7B — VeChain Foundation (@vechainofficial) April 8 2021

VeChain’s technology has also been utilized on several projects that are managed by its partner DNV. DNV uses VeChain's blockchain solution to manage the data from projects with the Danish company ReSea and the Norwegian industrial company Hydro.

The increase in VET price and adoption since the beginning of February has also led to a 1000% increase in the price of VeThor Token (VTHO) which is used to pay for transactions and smart contract interactions on the network.

An early March NFT-related collaboration with VIMworld also helped bring extra attention to VET and VTHO and was followed by a steady increase in price.

The positive benefits of these partnerships were reflected in data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro which shows that the market conditions for VET have been favorable for some time.

The VORTECS™ Score exclusive to Cointelegraph is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment trading volume recent price movements and Twitter activity.

As seen in the chart above the VORTECS™ Score for VET turned bullish and reached a high of 73 on April 3 about two days before a smaller price spike on April 5. Following this move the VORTECS™ Score increased to a high of 87 and remained in the green zone over the next three days as VET price gaine 35%.

Now that institutional investors now taking a serious interest in the crypto sector and the ways that blockchain technology can be integrated into various sectors VeChain’s real-world use cases and growing list of enterprise-level partners indicate that there is potential for further upside.

After the surgical mask and the do-it-yourself mask and the fashion mask: the smart mask.

Image: via The New York Times

The story begins with Marc Benioff CEO of cloud computing company Salesforce watching the MTV Video Music Awards last summer.

To be specific he was watching Will.i.am the rapper entrepreneur and founding member of the Black Eyed Peas cavorting around wearing what appeared to be a cross between a gas mask and an alien space helmet. So he called Will.i.am whose full name is William Adams and who has been a regular at Salesforce’s Dreamforce tech conference since 2010 and asked what in the world he had on his face. Will.i.am said it was an idea he had been noodling. So Benioff told Will.i.am that he really ought to talk to Darius Adamczyk CEO of Honeywell the multinational conglomerate that happened to be responsible for making millions of N95 face masks over the last year. Benioff made the introduction and Thursday the results of that conversation reached the market. After the surgical mask and the do-it-yourself mask and the fashion mask: the smart mask.“It’s a new category” said Will Lange Honeywell’s chief commercial officer for personal protective equipment. Called Xupermask and made of silicone with athletic mesh fabric on the sides it is a joint venture between Will.i.am and Honeywell. It fits snugly around the bottom half of the face and comes with three dual-speed fans a Honeywell HEPA filtration system (which the company is careful to say is not medical-quality) as well as noise-canceling headphones LED lights for nighttime a rechargeable battery and Bluetooth capability. It allows you to play music and take calls has a seal over the nose to keep glasses from fogging and makes the wearer look sort of like a sci-fi rhino warrior. It’s not exactly subtle. The mask costs $299 which is very expensive for a simple face mask but the average top-end price for noise-canceling headphones (less than Sony and Bose more than Apple). It was designed by Jose Fernandez the Hollywood costume designer who created the SpaceX suits for Elon Musk and worked on “Black Panther” “The Avengers” and “X-Men 2.” And it is sold in direct-to-consumer Supreme-style drops. It’s a bet in other words that hypebeast culture will embrace the mask. Coming just as vaccines are being more widely distributed and just as states like Texas Indiana and Mississippi are relaxing mask mandates the debut represents either the future of face masks or yet another fashion-tech misfire. “We are living in sci-fi times” Will.i.am said. The pandemic he said “is straight out of a friggin’ movie. But we are wearing masks from yesterday’s movie. So I wanted to make a mask to fit the era that we’re in.” That means in part learning the lesson of the sneaker. (Well and the smartphone. The sneaker and the smartphone combined!) After all what are shoes Will.i.am said but protective equipment for the feet? We’ve just forgotten that was their original purpose because shoes have become a form of self-expression. You could not he pointed out “walk into a mall or a restaurant or an airplane without shoes on” just as you aren’t supposed to walk into any of those places without a mask. “But you don’t have to tell anyone to wear shoes” he said. Therefore if you can make a mask serve the same purpose (or multipurpose) you win. Will.i.am was speaking via Zoom from his HQ in Los Angeles a space that contains a sound stage a recording studio his “fab lab” (where he makes prototypes) and now his Xupermask team. Will.i.am got the idea for Xupermask last March just before his 45th birthday when he was in Britain filming “The Voice” (he has been a judge on the program for 10 years) and Europe was beginning to go into lockdown. “I was worried about not being able to come in to America and even if I was able to get in about being on an airplane” he said. So he called his hardware team and told them to get working. He has been dipping in and out of technology since helping to found Beats Electronics in 2006. In 2014 he developed a fashion smartwatch called Puls and in 2016 came out with fashion earbuds you could wear around your neck like jewelry — Naomi Campbell and Kendall Jenner were ambassadors — but neither product really took off (arguably the whole wearables market is not exactly a rocket ship). He doesn’t care. He loves research and development. “I think L stands for learn not loss” he said. Now however he has the might of Honeywell behind him and plans for Xupermask-related collaborations with artists and other brands. (He won’t name names though he did talk about how much he loved the North Face-Gucci collaboration.) And he really really doesn’t think masks are going away anytime soon — not if recent history is any indication. “SARS happened in Japan and Southeast Asia and they got over it and they still wear masks” he said suggesting the same would be true in the West especially since masks seemed to have helped limit flu cases too. In any case whatever happens on the ground he expects masks on airplanes to be the new norm. “That’s what I’m hearing” he said. He’s gotta feeling.

The two appointments will increase the number of female directors on Rugby Australia’s board from one to three so that three of the board’s seven voting directors will be women.

The appointment news comes from The Sydney Morning Herald who obtained a member-wide notice issued before the next annual general meeting to be held on April 29.

Currently Pip Marlow CEO of Salesforce Australia and New Zealand is the only woman on the Rugby Australia board.

Matthew Hanning is also expected to be appointed to the Rugby Australia board this month alongside Dr Wilson and Penrose.

Dr Jane Wilson has had a varied career in medicine finance and banking and has two decades of experience as an independent director across a range of organisations including public companies and not-for-profits.

She currently serves as a non-executive director at Transurban Ltd Costa Group and Sonic Healthcare Ltd and as a guardian of the Future Fund Australia’s Sovereign Wealth Fund. Dr Wilson holds a medical degree from The University of Queensland and a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School.

Karen Penrose is an experienced business leader banker and non-executive director. She has twenty years’ experience across business and finance including at Commonwealth Bank of Australia and HSBC.

She is also a non-executive director of Vicinity Centres Limited Ramsay Health Care Limited Estia Health Limited and the Bank of Queensland.

With the appointment of Dr Wilson and Penrose Rugby Australia will soon have some of the highest representation of women on its board among Australian sporting bodies.

It comes after a tumultuous period for women at Rugby Australia following the departure of former CEO Raelene Castle. In 2017 Castle became the first woman to lead one of Australia’s four top football codes. She only held the role for two years before deciding to step down."

After the preview the official presentation of the annual Tiffany high jewelery collection arrives the Tiffany Blue Book 2021. This year the name for the high school jewelery collection is Colors Of Nature (inevitable perhaps given that the environment is increasingly precious). The collection includes over 500 high jewelery creations by Tiffany & Co and Jean Schlumberger and after New York was presented in Shanghai. Creating 500 unique pieces of fine jewelery is perhaps an absolute record. But attention is also drawn to the exclusive preview of the spectacular Empire Diamond of more than 80 carats before it is mounted in the extraordinary re-edition inspired by the 1939 Universal Exposition necklace.



In any case the jewels shown in Shanghai are a selection of those that make up the Blue Book. The text accompanying the exhibition states that «by transforming the bright colors of nature into fascinating works of art the bold aesthetic of the collection inspires the immersive space where the extraordinary jewels are shown on a sensory journey through nature – earth sea ​​and sky. More than 35 different precious stones are on display in Shanghai including Tiffany’s most iconic gems tanzanite morganite and kunzite ».



The grand opening of the jewelry exhibition saw Chinese actress Xu Qing on the red carpet with Tiffany & Co. high jewelry Xu Qing wore an exquisite Tiffany necklace with mixed cut blue purple and pink spinels of over 81 carats and sapphires violet over 39 carats.

Now the company sells internal external and portable storage drives and competes with giants like Micron Technology Western Digital (WD) and Samsung. Recently Seagate announced that it has shipped over 3 Zettabytes (ZB) of data storage products since its inception.

This is a significant milestone that the data storage giant achieved after operating for over 42 years. It crossed the 1 Zettabyte milestone back in 2014 which was 36 years after its inception. However the company reached the 2 zettabytes milestone only after 4 years. But here comes the most surprising number the company has announced that it has surpassed the 3 zettabyte milestone in March 2021. It took Seagate only 2 years to sell the next zettabyte of storage products.

How Much is 3ZB of Storage?

Now as you can tell 3ZB of storage is much more than you can ever imagine. To give you an idea you can store 1.5 quadrillion selfies or 30 billion 4K movies or 7.5 trillion MP3 songs in 3ZB of storage. However if you look at it from a macro level it is not that much storage!

A recent International Data Corporation (IDC) report estimated that the sum of global data generated by 2025 will exponentially accelerate to 175 zettabytes. This is 58 times more than the amount of data storage shipped by the company to date.

Besides with more and more “smart” things around us Seagate says that more data is being generated in a single hour than what was being generated in an entire year about 20 years ago. Today a single self-driving car produces up to 32 terabytes (TB) of data in a day and Seagate estimates that a smart city can generate up to 2.5 petabytes (PB) worth of day in one day. Well 3 zettabytes does not seem like a big number now does it?

Moreover as per IDC companies and enterprises on average only use 32% of the data for their day-to-day operations. The rest 68% data simply sits and hogs the digital storage space.

When she’s not filming the hit Netflix series Dream Home Makeover (season three is currently in production) and designing furniture and accessories for the brand’s ongoing collaboration with Target she’s busy project scheming in the Utah headquarters of Studio McGee. The decorator is known for her brilliant modern interior design approach her clean look that is contemporary yet warm and she’s sharing some styling advice for how to apply her signature style to every room in the house.

LIVING ROOM

Shea's favorite living room idea is to bring personality by what she chooses to display. However “when things are scattered everywhere it tends to feel messy” she says. “Built-ins or freestanding shelving provide an opportunity to group objects such as framed family photos or personal travel mementos in an organized way.”

The designer also believes that every room needs at least one vintage piece whether it be rugs pillows or accessories. “They add character and make a home feel unique.” And fresh greenery goes a long way: McGee loves fiddle-leaf figs rubber trees olive trees and maidenhair ferns.

KITCHEN

The kitchen is perhaps one of the toughest spaces to inject personality and warmth thanks to its sterile quality and why we're always keen to hear more modern kitchen ideas. McGee’s solution? Add organic texture through woven materials and natural woods. “I like displaying trays leaning bread boards against the backsplash and using a wooden bowl for fruit” she says. “It’s also a good idea to corral objects into groupings. So instead of lining the entire countertop with items try putting a crock of utensils a spoon rest and your salt and pepper by the stove and then another collection of items could go on the island. And again don’t forget some vintage pieces.”

BATHROOM

Like the kitchen the bathroom is a functional space and can often appear cold especially if you're focussing on white bathroom ideas. Jars and canisters combine beauty and function according to Shea. “You need to have items such as cotton balls and makeup brushes in the bathroom so they might as well be stored in beautiful containers on the counter” she says. “I also love little dishes or a pretty bowl that can act as a drop zone for jewelry and other small items. And I always have a good bottle of hand soap and a nice hand towel.”

BEDROOM

When it comes to the bedroom it’s all about creating ambience which begins with beautiful bedroom lighting ideas. “You want to make sure you have enough accent lighting so try a combination of floor and table lamps in addition to overhead fixtures” says McGee who appreciates having several options to provide for more ambient lighting at night.

Aside from lighting she says “Candles add coziness and a nice scent which helps create an experience. I also like having pretty stacked boxes around because they are good for holding anything even phone chargers.”

Paint

Paint is one of the most important elements of a room and anyone who has watched Shea's Netflix series knows that she’s a big proponent of a fresh coat of one of the best white paints for interior walls. “The sun bounces off it in a beautiful way and it provides a clean backdrop for layering any style” she says. But what shade is the right shade?

According to Shea true crisp whites are best in contemporary homes while whites with cream undertones are more traditional. “If I’m going to put four samples on the wall I’d start with Benjamin Moore’s White Dove Swiss Coffee and Simply White and Alabaster by Sherwin-Williams. Just be sure to look at the samples throughout the day as the color can really change.”

Other go-to paint shades include Benjamin Moore’s Natural Cream (“a putty tone that pairs well with whites”) and Peppercorn (“a moody color that can look charcoal blue or soft black depending on the light”) by Sherwin-Williams. “When I go for a darker shade it’s in a powder room office or guest bedroom.”",,,,,,,,,

Google reportedly said it was ending support for the Shopping app on Android and iOS and the clients will work through June.

Google has recently worked on expanding shopping functionality through its Search Image Search and YouTube and has also been working on leveraged augmented reality.

“We’ll continue building features within the Shopping tab and other Google surfaces including the Google app that make it easy for people to discover and shop for the products they love” a Google spokesperson said according to the report.

Version 59 of Google Shopping has already started to roll out with a “something went wrong” message which prompts users to “continue shopping on shopping.google.com.” However there’s not much detail on what this message entails for the users not in the know the report says.

The Android and web interfaces are essentially identical experiences. The “Home” feed also comes with a list of recommendations for other products one might be interested in and a list of items one has “saved.”

The report from 9to5Google notes that Shopping doesn’t need its own unique app as many users just end up using Search when looking up products and the tech giant will be able to save resources by shutting down the app.

Amazon which has done as much as any company to bring about the demise of shopping malls in the United States has now come full circle by buying up struggling malls and turning them into distribution centers for its rapidly growing e-commerce empire.

NBC News on Tuesday reported that over the last several months Amazon has gone on a shopping spree with a number of new mall purchases. Last month the Seattle-based retail giant won approval to convert a mall in Baton Rouge Louisiana into a 3.4 million-square-foot distribution center. That same month Amazon won similar approval to turn a mall in Knoxville Tennessee into a 220000-square-foot distribution center.

Those deals followed a December decision by the local planning board in Worcester Massachusetts to let Amazon convert the city’s Greendale Mall into a 121000-square-foot distribution center.

An analysis by Coresight Research found that between 2016 and 2019 Amazon converted about 25 shopping malls into distribution facilities. That pace should quicken amid a bricks-and-mortar retail environment that has not only been hammered by the continued rise of online shopping but been nearly decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This has left owners of shopping malls looking for ways to monetize assets that are failing at an alarming rate.

The Wall Street Journal reported last summer that Simon Property Group the nation’s biggest mall owner was in talks with Amazon to turn Simon’s anchor department stores into Amazon distribution centers. Those talks reportedly focused on converting stores formerly or currently occupied by J.C. Penney and Sears Holdings both of which have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and announced plans to close dozens of stores across the country.

U.S. real estate tycoons couldn’t keep up with their billionaire peers in the pandemic era.

Let’s ponder data from my trusty spreadsheet tracking the ups and downs in the combined wealth of the nation’s 20 richest individual property owners.

Collectively the 20 tycoons were worth $97 billion in Forbes’ 2021 accounting — or an average $4.9 billion each. That was up $13 billion — an average gain of $700 million per tycoon — over 12 dramatic months of a global battle against coronavirus.

While the world was slowly winning the pandemic war and real estate values were recovering from coronavirus damage 16 of these 20 tycoons actually saw their standing drop on Forbes’ global wealth scoreboard. Their combined average ranking falling 126 spots to 688.

Few would say those real estate gains were puny but a deeper look at Forbes’ research tells us a lot about the rarified billionaire world.

A year ago 2095 billionaires from all industries were worth a combined $8 trillion averaging $3.8 billion per fortune. This year 2755 billionaires — yes 660 more — were worth $13.1 trillion. That’s a $4.8 billion average.

So the spreadsheet tells me the assets of the world’s typical billionaire grew $1 billion or 24% in a pandemic-scarred year. The total net worth of the 20 real estate tycoons rose “only” 16%.

Some of this underperformance can be tied to lingering real estate uncertainties such as the future of shopping malls and office towers. But much of the gap is tied to the stock market a wealth-creation machine for far more fortunes than property owners.

The S&P 500 the key benchmark for U.S. shares rose 23% in the same period. The Nasdaq Composite a yardstick for red-hot technology shares skyrocketed 43%. And it’s a worldwide bull market as the S&P Global 1200 index rose 27% in the year.

No sympathy is required for these rich property owners but their portfolios did “suffer” sub-par results when looking through this global wealth prism.

Here’s who they are how their riches fared in the last two years and how their wealth changed all according to Forbes …

The gang including the now infamous Piers 56 smile sweetly for the camera – and Piers bears a remarkable resemblance to his own daughter Elise Morgan.

One fan agreed and wrote: ""Adorable! Elise might have liked your cap!""

Another said: ""Is there a likeness in that picture of you and your daughter""

The snap came as Piers continued his criticism of Meghan Markle.

He recently demanded Meghan name those in Buckingham Palace who she claimed turned their backs on her when she was suicidal.

Interviewed in the US by Fox's Tucker Carlson Piers said Prince Harry's wife had accused two people of being ""unspeakably cruel"".

He added: ""If that is true let's have the names of these people and let's go to them and ask them 'Is this true?'

""Did you tell a suicidal woman who told you she was suicidal not to get help?' because I find that impossible to believe.""

Morgan quit Good Morning Britain after refusing to apologise for saying he did not believe Meghan's TV claims to Oprah Winfrey.

He told Carlson that Meghan and Harry's chat contained 17 allegations that ""have now been proven to be either completely untrue or massively exaggerated or unprovable"".

He added: ""It's not really about Meghan Markle she's a delusional duchess who wants to make millions off the royals while trashing family. It's really about free speech.""

He also insisted in a recent column for Mail Online that he was not making light of Meghan attesting to have had suicidal thoughts while in the royal family but doubted her claim that she was told by court officials not to seek help.

He said it is outrageous that Sharon Osbourne has now quit US show The Talk as she was ""driven out for the crime of defending me"" against her colleague who said Morgan was racist ""simply because I disbelieve Meghan Markle"".

But he said what had happened to him and Sharon Osbourne – who has been forced to leave her role as a panelist on CBS show The Talk – ""isn't really about Ms Markle"".

""She (Meghan) is just one of many whiny privileged hypocritical celebrities who now cynically exploit victimhood to suppress free speech value their own version of the truth above the actual truth and seek to cancel anyone that deviates from their woke world view or who dares to challenge the veracity of their inflammatory statements"" Morgan wrote.

""No it's about a far bigger issue than one delusional duchess and that's everyone's right to be free to express our honestly held opinions forcefully and passionately if we feel like it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtOTQ1NjkwOS9QZXJyaWUtRWR3YXJkcy10aWNrbGVzLWZhbnMtcG9zZXMtc3VsdHJ5LXNuYXAtc3RhaXJzLWNsZWFuZXItcGF0aWVudGx5LXdhaXRzLmh0bWzSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL3R2c2hvd2Jpei9hcnRpY2xlLTk0NTY5MDkvYW1wL1BlcnJpZS1FZHdhcmRzLXRpY2tsZXMtZmFucy1wb3Nlcy1zdWx0cnktc25hcC1zdGFpcnMtY2xlYW5lci1wYXRpZW50bHktd2FpdHMuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Perrie Edwards tickles fans as she poses for sultry snap on stairs while a cleaner patiently waits,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.dailymail.co.uk', port=443): Read timed out.

Cafe Studios is Vox Media’s fourth merger or acquisition in the last three years. In its biggest deal Vox Media in the fall of 2019 bought New York Media publisher of New York Magazine and digital properties including the Cut and Vulture. The company also has acquired Epic a film TV audio and production studio and commenting platform Coral.

“Preet and his team at Cafe have built a successful podcast studio with a compelling perspective — and an equally impressive community of devoted listeners” Jim Bankoff Vox Media’s chairman and CEO said in a statement. “Bringing Cafe into the Vox Media Podcast Network is aligned with our goal of delivering high-quality editorial content at scale and providing audiences highly relevant voices and insights.”

Bharara said in a statement “This is an opportunity for tremendous growth with a company that shares in Cafe’s mission values and commitment to quality. Our creators are bursting at the seams with plans for more thoughtful educational content and in Vox Media we earn a partner with a large audience strategic business and a strong reach across text video and events.”

Last summer Vox Media laid off 6% of its workforce letting go about 70 employees amid a steep revenue drop-off. The company expects be profitable in 2021 and still has cash on hand from $200 million in funding it raised in 2015 that valued the company at more than $1 billion the Wall Street Journal reported.

“We’re actually the busiest we’ve ever been” said Lisa Deal Director of Pharmacy at Sun Behavioral Health in Georgetown.

Sun Behavioral expanded its intensive outpatient telehealth program during the pandemic and did so again recently to allow for evening appointments. Deal says this has allowed the behavioral health center to reach more patients in the region than ever before.

But she adds it’s still not enough to address the growing mental health problem in the region and Dr. David Tam the CEO of the Sussex County health system Beebe Healthcare agrees.

“There is a shortage of mental health providers” said Tam. “We recognized that during the pandemic during the lockdown as people really had trouble with anxiety and with depression that came from being isolated.”

Beebe also started its own tele-psychiatry program last Spring around the time Gov. John Carney as part of his COVID-19 emergency order allowed for Delaware providers to hire out of state psychiatrists to treat Delaware patients via telehealth.

But Tam says its appointments for this service continue to be booked up. He says data suggests patients are still delaying mental health care and the need for services in the region far outweighs the resources.

“That’s the way this integrated approach working with the state is going to help us alleviate suffering in this what I call the next pandemic or the continuing pandemic in terms of the opioid epidemic and behavioral health challenges” he said.

Tam says Beebe is looking into starting a mobile health unit that can visit patients where they live in the county’s more isolated rural areas—a concept that was first piloted in Delaware by the University of Delaware and has also been used by ChristianaCare.

Deal agrees those services are “imperative” in southern Delaware.

“We would love to work with Beebe and other hospitals and health systems to increase the capacity for treatment” she said.

Deal and Tam both agree more inpatient services are needed as well. Deal says Sun Behavioral’s inpatient unit for substance use disorder is at capacity at all times.

“We actually end up having to schedule admissions to get the patients in as quick as we can because they’re just full” said Deal.

Delaware saw a record 446 overdose deaths statewide last year according to the state’s Department of Safety and Homeland Security.

Tam also says psychiatry training is top of mind as the Beebe looks to roll out its planned residency program.

Both and Beebe and Bayhealth are recipients of three-year $750000 federal grants to start doctor residency programs. Bayhealth recently announced its inaugural class of residents.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8veW9ya2Jsb2cuY29tL29ubHl5b3JrL2Fzay1qb2FuLXRydWNraW5nLWhhcmR3YXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ask Joan: Following up on trucking company and hardware stores - Only in York County,"Ask Joan: Following up on trucking company and hardware stores

After hitting a lot of new questions in my last column I thought this week might be a good time to go back and follow up on some previous queries that I’ve received more details about.

What’s inside

1. Following up on trucking company

2. Helping solve the hardware mystery

1. Following up on trucking company

Back in 2018 reader Steve McGinnis wrote about a photo I’ve shared several times of the former York County Shopping Center. He was curious about the trucking company pictured in the lower right corner. I did have a reader Charles Rearich reply some time ago and mention that it was probably Mason and Dixon Trucking Co. I also heard the same from Jerrold Keyes.

But today I have a short story to share from another Steve this one Steve Godfrey. He writes “I’m responding to Mr. McGinnis’s question about the trucking company pictured in the lower right corner of the York County Shopping Center. It was home of Mason-Dixon Trucking Lines.”

He continued “My father and uncle worked there beginning in 1954. They eventually moved to Emigsville before going out of business in 1984. After high school in 1971 I became the third-generation family member to work in the trucking industry. My grandfather got the ball rolling by working at Motor Freight Express. We all put at least 30 or more years in the business. As they used to say back in the day if you bought it a truck brought it.”

As we enter Year 2 of pandemic living I thought that was a particularly good sentiment to share. I am so grateful to all the truckers who’ve kept things moving ensuring a steady stream of goods and groceries that come to my door.

2. Helping solve the hardware mystery

A fun question last week came from a reader named John who wanted me to settle a dispute with a coworker. John thought the former Hechinger hardware used to be where Sheetz and the Hyundai dealer are in Springettsbury Township on Memory Lane; his coworker said it was the building later occupied by Wolf Furniture.

Well fellow Yorkblogger Stephen H. Smith of the amazing Yorkspast was able to play referee for me as it were! He wrote “I often shopped at Hechinger and Lowe’s in Springettsbury Township. After Hechinger went bankrupt Wolf’s eventually moved into their vacant store on the corner of Industrial Highway and Northern Way. Lowe’s was originally in a smaller store when it opened in the mid ’70s along Industrial Highway; that is the building that became a Hyundai dealership; after Lowe’s moved to their present mega-store in the York Marketplace. The Sheetz next to the Hyundai dealership replaced a Roy Rogers Restaurant.”

I had mentioned I was particularly interested in this because I thought I remembered a West Manchester Hechinger’s where the Sheetz is now on Carlisle Road. I was close but not quite and was so excited when Stephen was able to provide more details on this as well.

He continued “When Hechinger had their going out of business sale I remember also seeing Builders Square tags on items. In looking up that connection I discovered a paragraph in an April 8 2000 article in the York Daily Record which concisely answers the second part of your Hechinger query. ‘Last year those west-end residents lost Builders Square on Route 30 which closed after its parent company Hechinger Co. filed for bankruptcy. For years Builders Square in Northwest Plaza Shopping Center served as the only home improvement outlet within miles. In 1998 a Sheetz convenience store had replaced a Leaner Home Center at the corner of Carlisle Road and Brougher Lane.’

So it was not Hechinger’s but Leaner’s that I remember so fondly. I used to go there on Saturdays with my dad a woodworker who was always looking for some new tool or project. I told Stephen I was so happy to have that memory made clearer!"

Flights in and out of Southwest Florida International Airport are seeing delays and even some cancellations due to severe weather.

These delays and cancellations could continue to increase. So far more than 40 flights have been canceled and 60 have been delayed due to the storms.

Antonina Randazzo is from New Jersey. “We got here around 11 for our flight at 1:45 and then it was delayed to 2:30” Randazzo said.

Ben Penner is from California. “We got here to fly out at about 12 o’clock and we’ve been here ever since” said Penner. “I think it got delayed at least five or six times then 5:30.”

Then his flight was canceled. “They finally canceled it and pushed us to have to rebook” he said.

Others weren’t even told when they’d get to leave. Bernadette Troy is from Chicago. “We have no idea when we’re going to be out of here” she said.

The Troy family desperately wanted to get home to Chicago. They even discussed getting RV and driving back.

“It’s her birthday so we want to get home see the kids” said David Troy.

“It’s incredibly frustrating. I want to go home. I want to go to Chicago. Florida’s great but it’s not home. It’s not home” Bernadette said.

As part of an expected surge in domestic summer travel Frontier Airlines has announced 16 new routes this week with a variety of new flights including six new routes from Atlanta.

New Seasonal Routes

From a future crew base in Atlanta the low-cost carrier plans to add six routes. With the addition of these six routes Frontier Airlines expands to 22 routes in the Delta Air Lines hub. In addition to heavy Delta competition on all six of its additions the airline will face competition on its Cleveland Ohio and Dallas/Fort Worth routes via its low-cost carrier counterparts Spirit and Southwest.

“We’re excited to expand in Atlanta with six new nonstop routes” states Daniel Shurz Frontier Airlines’ senior vice president of commercial. “At Frontier we’re focused on delivering ‘Low Fares Done Right’ and constantly look for new travel opportunities for our customers. These new routes will now provide an affordable and convenient option for Atlantans to visit six popular cities. Additionally we’re looking forward to further deepening our roots in the community with our first-ever ATL crew base opening later this year.”

Meanwhile from Philadelphia Frontier Airlines will fly two new routes: to Portland Maine – four times a week – and Providence Rhode Island – three times a week. These moves expand its base to 25 connections.

While facing competition from hub-carrier American Airlines Frontier Airlines faces no low-cost carriers on its routes. Portland Maine is a popular Northeast destination this year due to its presence as an outdoors destination in Maine. In a recent route announcement United Airlines focused on Portland Maine adding six Midwest destinations to the airport.

Additionally Frontier Airlines is launching new flights from Myrtle Beach and Orlando focused on taking advantage of leisure travel to warmer destinations. Places in the Northeast United States like Buffalo New York and Providence Rhode Island will see a new connection to the beach town of Myrtle Beach. These routes will face no competition at all. In the summer of 2021 Myrtle Beach will receive new services on Southwest and point-to-point Midwest flights on United among other new routes. Meanwhile Frontier Airlines will launch a new destination – Rochester New York – with flights to Orlando.

The only international flight in the route announcements added to Frontier’s route network is between Miami and Montego Bay Jamaica. Currently the airline serves Montego Bay seasonally via Philadelphia. The main competition Frontier will face is American Airlines.

Shurz states “We’re excited to grow again in Miami with new nonstop flights to Montego Bay. ‘Mobay’ is an incredibly unique destination with countless activities extraordinary scenery and plenty of warm sunshine. This new service offers travelers unprecedented affordability and convenience to visit this top vacation spot.”

Finally Chicago secures new services to Dallas/Fort Worth and St. Louis Missouri on Frontier Airlines adding to make a total of 19 destinations. Meanwhile Dallas/Fort Worth receives new flights to Nashville Tennessee in addition to the Chicago flight mentioned above. Besides pressure from hub carriers American Airlines and United Airlines on its routes from Chicago Frontier Airlines will face competition via Spirit Airlines on its flight to Dallas/Fort Worth and Southwest Airlines on its flight to St. Louis.

Summer Expansion

Many U.S. airlines are banking on a recovery in the domestic sector during the summer. For example low-cost startup Avelo Airlines announced $19 fares from Burbank Calif. to 11 destinations in the Western United States. Another U.S. startup Breeze Airways is looking to start flights to underserved destinations this summer.

Meanwhile legacy carriers like American Airlines are strengthening their core hubs in preparation for rising leisure demand. In May American Airlines expects to utilize 100% of its aircraft. Meanwhile Delta Airlines has announced a route expansion to destinations it believes will see higher demand this summer including Iceland and Alaska. As mentioned above United Airlines announced a point-to-point expansion focused on leisure travel.

Other carriers have taken advantage of the situation to enter new airports which previously were not possible. For example JetBlue has utilized current travel restrictions to obtain temporary slots at London Gatwick and London Heathrow. Meanwhile a lack of traffic at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport allowed Southwest Airlines to establish a sizable presence at the airport complementing its operation at Midway.

Low-cost carriers have continually added new point-to-point routes throughout the pandemic which they believe can attract leisure traffic. Frontier Airlines is following in these footsteps adding point-to-point flights to places it believes can profit for the low-cost carrier.

According to a press release from the Colombia-based airline the route will be operated by an Airbus A320 aircraft and is in response to passenger demand for direct connectivity.

“We are seeing an important opportunity to strengthen connectivity options for passengers traveling between Costa Rica and Miami United States making us start a direct operation between the two markets in July” said David Alemán regional director for Avianca.

“In addition this decision responds to requests that travelers have been making to us.”

Tickets are on sale for the flights which will be operated as follows:

Departs SJO at 10:35 a.m. and arrives in Miami at 3:38 p.m.

Departs MIA at 2:20 p.m. and arrives in Costa Rica at 3:23 p.m.

Avianca is far from the only airline with nonstop flights between Costa Rica and the Miami area. American Airlines JetBlue and Spirit all offer routes to either Miami or Ft. Lauderdale (FLL). Southwest Airlines also operated a route to FLL but it has been suspended since the pandemic began.

Avianca says it will also maintain flights from Costa Rica to El Salvador and Bogotá with onward connections throughout the Americas.

Tourism is one of Costa Rica’s principal economic drivers. Before the pandemic it contributed to 8.2% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) and created 9% of the nation’s jobs according to the ICT.

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kZWNvZGluZy1zdGFubGV5LWJsYWNrLWRlY2tlci1pbmMtMDUxNDExOTgyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight,"Comprehensive SWOT analysis based on Stanley Black & Decker Inc's latest SEC 10-Q filing.

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit gross margin SG&A segment profit segment margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges such as supply chain transformation costs acquisition and divestiture-related items asset impairments restructuring and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

With this year’s Sakura Frappuccinos about to fade away from the menu as the actual blossoms fall from the trees it’s time to look ahead to a new period at Starbucks with the brand new Chai Chocolate Frappuccino.

Unlike other drinks on the menu though this one can only be purchased via a pre-pay ordering system which the chain has dubbed “Mobile Order & Pay“. Not a lot of people have used this system before so stores have special signboards in place to guide customers through the process.

Our resident Frappuccino expert K. Masami is a dab hand at using the system so let’s take a quick look at her walkthrough for purchasing the drink.

▼ First you have to get out your smartphone and download the app or alternatively you can order through the official website.

Masami recommends ordering via the app because as the system doesn’t allow you to select a pick-up time it’s best to order while you’re actually inside a Starbucks store or at least nearby.

▼ When you open the app there’s a “Mobile Order & Pay” page on the top screen so tap it and select the store and product you want to receive and you’re done.

▼ If you register your Starbucks card in the app a withdrawal will be made from it otherwise you can pay by credit card.

After that your order number and nickname will appear with the expected time of completion at the bottom. In Masami’s case the drink would be ready in 10-15 minutes which gave her ample time to stroll down to her nearest Starbucks and wait for them to call out “Mexico“ her chosen nickname.

Drinks seem to be made as soon as the order is placed so it’s a good idea to get there earlier than the time specified or even better order while you’re inside the store so you can pick it up fresh from the counter.

Bypassing the usual ordering system at the register gives this drink an added aura of exclusivity and uniqueness and when it appeared on the counter our reporter “Mexico” was suitably impressed with its appearance.

The drink displayed mouthwatering shades of chocolate brown due to the chai syrup and chocolate chips blended into its milky base. At the very bottom of the cup even more flavour could be seen with a rich mound of chocolate sauce and whipped cream.

Masami loves chai and she loves chocolate but she’d never had them together before so she was curious to find out whether this would be her new favourite combination or too much of a good thing. Dipping her spoon into the mix she could see tiny choc chip pieces scattered throughout the drink yet when she lifted the spoonful to her mouth the first thing she tasted was the beautiful warming spices of chai.

The chocolate notes followed soon after and as she made her way through the drink the flavour profile became sweeter. The chai was clearly the star of the show however and it was a great casting decision as the varying amounts of chocolate throughout the beverage allowed the chai to shine with different levels of sweetness to complement its spicy warmth.

The crunchy chocolate chips added a nice textural accent to the drink and though it was rich and creamy it was deliciously refreshing at the same time.

Masami absolutely loved this chai and chocolate combination and will definitely be purchasing it again while it’s still available. Only on the menu until 27 July the new Frappuccino retails for 616 yen (US$5.61).

And if you’re looking for a non-dairy Frappuccino alternative don’t forget the Banana ‘N’ Almond Milk Frappuccino is still on the menu until 13 April.

Well look no further because we have found the perfect drink for anyone wanting to feel like a princess!

Thanks to TikTok user @secretmenudrinks we have found this yummy concoction fit for any princess!

Even though she shows us how to order it we’ve broken it down for you using the Starbucks app to make for easy ordering.

First under the Cold Drinks menu select Refreshers and then select the Pink Drink and adjust the size to your preference.

Then underneath the Juice Options select to add regular Guava Juice Blend.

Next under the Add-Ins menu remove the strawberries.

Under flavors add Raspberry Syrup. When you add the syrup depending on the size that you order will depend on how many pumps of syrup will be added. For instance I ordered a Venti which calls for 6 pumps of syrup but I didn’t necessarily want my drink to be super sweet. So I just adjusted the pumps to half of that amount. It’s really up to you and your personal preference.

Finally go to the toppings menu and add the Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Foam.

All this drink is missing is a tiara because it is so good! It’s fruity and with half the pumps of syrup it isn’t too overly sweet. I can definitely see myself sipping on this all summer long!

The other thing I love about this drink just like with most Starbucks beverages is that it’s completely customizable based on your personal palette. If you want to switch it up a bit I would switch the Guava Juice Blend for the Peach Juice Blend and makes a Princess Peach drink!

Have you tried the Princess Drink yet? Let us know your thoughts in the comments!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc2VhdHRsZXJlZmluZWQuY29tL2VhdC1kcmluay9jYWZlLWFsbGVncm8tc2VhdHRsZS1lc3ByZXNzby1iYXItY29mZmVlLWNoYXJtLWNvbW11bml0edIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seattle's original espresso bar is still serving up coffee charm & community,"If you walk down the Ave and you're not paying attention you may miss the sandwich board sign directing you to . Hidden down the alley anchored by Magus Books and MOD Pizza is the unassuming coffee shop a perfect example of not judging a book by its cover — or a cafe by its weathered signage.

Cafe Allegro is Seattle's oldest espresso bar established in the University District in 1975. Dave Olsen opened the business with a menu of quality espresso drinks before expanding to more beverages and pastries from local businesses. Their beans are imported from family farms around the world and roasted onsite. Cafe Allegro also sells their own coffee in-store and online. The cafe even inspired Starbucks espresso and is directly linked to the Seattle juggernaut as Olsen went on to become a Starbucks roaster and head buyer. Current co-owners Chris Peterson and Kate Robinson both started with Cafe Allegro as employees while in college at UW before taking over the helm.

As Seattle's original espresso bar Cafe Allegro has a place in the city's history. It has influenced many coffee companies and businesses that followed while never relinquishing what makes them unique and keeping customers coming back for more.



""Each year we stretch and grow adding and subtracting always keeping in mind what makes Allegro well Allegro"" Robinson said. ""It's the bit of magic absorbed into the space from each person who visits.""

In a city that continues to grow and evolve it's comforting to return to a tried-and-true original that really represents Seattle's quirks charm and appeal.



While the cafe holds on tight to its rich history the company has adapted and changed positively with the times and local competition. Coffee options have expanded to include milk alternatives drip coffee and cold brew and they've updated their space to include WiFi and outlets for computer usage.

""We embrace competition because it forces us to think about our place in the community who we want to be and why it matters we're still here"" Robinson said.



Beyond their top-notch and notable coffee Cafe Allegro offers a taste of Seattle that you don't need to find in a mug. The space is eclectic and bigger than it appears from the outside. Work from local artists hangs on the walls as well as framed paper bills located behind the register. The cafe has three seating areas and a hidden staircase that leads to an outdoor deck and onsite coffee roasting room. The local staple is a great place to study for UW students for city residents and tourists to meet and mingle and for anybody walking by to grab a cup of Joe.

As Robinson endearingly put it ""Once you find us our hidden alleyway location feels a bit like stepping into old Seattle bohemian vibes mixed with working-class Seattle flannels sitting together pondering fates over a strong cup of coffee.""



Community also plays a key role in the essence of the cafe. Proceeds from their Community Blend coffee go to local non-profits and they have a poster wall covered in advertisements and promotions for local events.

""Allegro quickly morphed into a basecamp for the community-conscious to gather organize and support each other helping beyond the self"" Robinson said. ""To this day we honor that history by donating regularly to various non-profits donating time and inventory and helping out where we can. We are a space that connects communities through cups of coffee.""



When the pandemic hit Cafe Allegro had to pivot. Before COVID the business had only been closed one day since 1992 because of a building fire so the closure hit the staff hard.

""Because our business is more than just selling coffee we had to quickly step up our game to keep in contact with our community so that we could continue our relationships while temporarily separated"" Robinson said.



The cafe shifted its focus to online expanding its digital marketing and social media presence. They expanded their online store to be able to ship roasted coffee beans to customers. Online store purchases have kept Cafe Allegro afloat during this time and the encouragement and support from the community and customers has not gone unnoticed.

Griffin Baron 39 and Jonathan Celner met for a coffee at the same Illinois cafe they first encountered each other nearly two decades ago after connecting on social media.

Baron was just 21 and working as a supervisor at the Wilmette branch of Starbucks in Illinois when Celner's mother Lisabeth Rohlck unexpectedly went into labor.

The former barista said he heard high-pitched screams coming from the bathroom but he initially thought that someone had simply locked themselves inside.

Griffin Baron (left) was reunited with Jonathan Celner (right) at the same Starbucks where he had helped deliver him as a baby 18 years ago

A customer Tricia Monico went into the bathroom and came back to report that Rohlck was having a baby and instructed Baron to call 911.

Baron told The Record North Shore: 'I open the bathroom door and there's this woman on the rail huffing and puffing and ready to go and there is the head three-quarters out and there is Tricia holding her hand and saying 'You're doing great you're doing great' and four minutes later: 'Waaaah.''

A baby boy was born just minutes later and EMTs arrived to take the mother and child to hospital.

At the time there was plenty of media interest in the 'Starbucks baby' but in those weeks Baron never came face to face with the child he had helped deliver.

He told Good Morning America that since then he has thought about Celner 'constantly' and often wondered about the sort of child he had turned out to be.

An online search revealed that Rohlck had died from complications relating to breast cancer and her husband Thomas Celner died in 2020.

Baron was just 21 at the time he helped deliver Celner and at the time there was plenty of media interest in the story of the 'Starbucks baby'

On a GoFundMe page attached to his parents' names Baron left a comment in hope that it may connect him to Jonathan. Celner's aunt responded and Baron who now lives in Chicago was able to find Jonathan on Facebook.

Baron and Celner had a coffee together at the Wilmette branch of Starbucks on March 21 and spoke for about an hour. They now plan to stay in touch.

'The story always reminded me of my mom which I really enjoy' Celner who works for UPS and is studying at community college told GMA.

Celner's mother Lisabeth Rohlck would tell her son about the story of how he was born and all the media attention that followed

The Wilmette branch of Starbucks when Baron helped to deliver a baby boy 18 years ago

'She would always tell me the story and would say how insane those next few weeks were for her - just a total media circus.'

'When Griffin [Baron] reached out it came full circle which was cool.'

On Instagram Baron shared picture of the two men in Starbucks writing: 'We were finally able to connect and it was great to fill in a lot of holes that he and I had about each other.'

He added: 'The day he was born was a life-changing experience for me (and obviously him) and not only was it great meeting him but I gained a new friend out of it too.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZm9vZC5uZHR2LmNvbS9uZXdzL3dhdGNoLWdvcmRvbi1yYW1zYXktcGxheXMtYS1wcmFuay1vbi1zdGFyYnVja3MtZW1wbG95ZWUtMjQxMDczNdIBYGh0dHBzOi8vZm9vZC5uZHR2LmNvbS9uZXdzL3dhdGNoLWdvcmRvbi1yYW1zYXktcGxheXMtYS1wcmFuay1vbi1zdGFyYnVja3MtZW1wbG95ZWUtMjQxMDczNS9hbXAvMQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch: Gordon Ramsay Plays A Prank On Starbucks Employee,"Chef Gordon Ramsay is known to joke around at the expense of other people.

Building Hooks Charter Business for Yachts Helicopters Planes | Business,"The Enterprise Fish Co. building in Santa Barbara is being gutted to be turned into a yacht and helicopter/plane charter business.

Construction is underway and visible from State Street.

Santa Barbara company Silver Air plans to adaptively reuse the building at 225 State St. and transform it into a place where people can charter yachts helicopters and airplanes.

The building also will be home to visitor-serving materials and information for people wanting to learn about chartering a yacht or plane.

For the past four decades the building was home to a restaurant until it closed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Enterprise Fish building had been on the market for a year until Silver Air came along.

“The goal is to preserve the historic qualities of the building” said Jeff Hornbuckle an architect with the Cearnal Collective the firm working on the project. “People know the building so well. We want to preserve the character.”

Silver Air is a Santa Barbara-based charter aviation and charter yacht company that was launched 12 years ago. It primarily focused on aircraft management aircraft charter and aircraft sales. The company is shifting its market focus and service offerings. It first operated out of the Santa Barbara Airport then out of several downtown locations and then from an office on upper State Street.

The latest project went before the Historic Landmarks Commission in February and the Santa Barbara Planning Commission last summer.

In order for the company which will be called Silver Air/Silver Water to operate from the site it needs to be considered visitor-serving or commercial recreational. The area is zoned “hotel and related commerce.” The Planning Commission made that determination at its July 9 meeting.

As it stands now the 6800-square-foot building’s brick walls are up but the top is partially open and the inside is hollowed out. Crews removed the rooftop equipment refrigeration units and other equipment in the rear patio. Plans call for restoration of the existing brick and mortar joints and arched storefronts along State Street and a 7-foot-tall wrought iron fence along a portion of the building.

The windows along the parking lot are deteriorated and will be replaced. The Enterprise Fish smokestack — a feature that has been there since the site was home to a laundry facility Enterprise Laundry built in 1909 — will remain. The building was mostly rebuilt after the 1925 earthquake and it existed as a commercial laundry until 1977 when it became a restaurant.

Urban historian Nicole Hernandez prepared a report for the site. Although the building is not a structure of merit it is on the city’s list for consideration of the designation.

“The unique and expressive brick façade with its three large rounded arch openings facing State Street has been an established and familiar feature of State Street since 1977 and the changes to the property have acquired historic significance in its own right” Hernandez wrote in a January report.

At last summer’s Planning Commission meeting Jason Middleton co-founder of the company said he was attempting to pivot into the marine space and do with marine service what the company does with aviation.

“When we start Silver Water we really feel that it is important to be in an area that not only has a lot of visitors but that’s also down by the water” Middleton said. “I think it is going to be very important for us to have access to the waterfront and be more where our customers are actually going to be.”

Each team enters the championship game with a chance to bring home its first title. As the Huskies and Minutemen near the pinnacle of the sport let's take a look back at their journeys.

St. Cloud State Huskies

Regular season

St. Cloud State entered the season as underdogs picked to finish fourth in the NCHC. Yet the Huskies and coach Brett Larson surpassed expectations all season with the ability to rally and win close games. Heading into the NCAA tournament 52% of St. Cloud State's wins were one-goal games. The ability to close out close contests helped the Huskies finish in second place in both conference regular season play and their conference tournament.

NCAA tournament

St. Cloud State entered the NCAA tournament as the second seed in the Northeast region. In the opening game against 3-seed Boston University St. Cloud won 6-2 to advance. In the regional final against 1-seed Boston College the Huskies found themselves down 1-0 early when senior forward Easton Brodzinski broke his leg. Despite the injury the Huskies rallied as a team to score four straight goals to win the game. Brodzinski’s injury has become a defining moment for this St. Cloud State team as they look to “do it for Easton” and win the championship.

Frozen Four semifinals

In Thursday night's Frozen Four matchup against Minnesota State the Huskies entered as the underdogs and undermanned without Brodzinski. The game was a high-scoring affair coming down to the final seconds. Tied 4-4 entering the final minute St. Cloud State's Nolan Walker scored the game-winning goal with 53.2 seconds left. The win marked the 10th one-goal win for the Huskies this season.

Key players this season

Forward Nolan Walker

Huskies forward Nolan Walker is third in points on the season with none bigger than his game-winning goal Thursday night. Walker has eight points through three NCAA tournament games and looks to continue to being a consistent offensive force for St. Cloud State in the championship game.

Forward Joe Molenaar

Entering the Frozen Four freshman Joe Molenaar had played in just 11 games and did not score a goal this season. When inserted into the lineup for the injured Brodzinski Molenaar was thrust into the spotlight. In the biggest game of his collegiate career so far Molenaar scored the game-tying goal with 10:14 to go in the third period.

“When the opportunity came I'm just trying to do the best I can to help the team” said Molenaar postgame.

The Huskies will need Molenaar to step up once again on the big stage this time for a chance at a title.

Forward Will Hammer

As the first St. Cloud-native to play on a Huskies Frozen Four team face-off specialist Will Hammer is vital to St. Cloud State's success. From his spot on the fourth line Hammer scored a key goal against Boston College in the regional final. However it is what Hammer does away from the net that is important to the team's success. Hammer's 56% face-off win rate will be key to St. Cloud State's championship hopes.

UMass Minutemen

Regular season

The Minutemen entered the 2020-21 season looking to redeem themselves from finishing as runner-up in the 2019 championship. Under coach Greg Carvel UMass has ascended into one of hockey's premier teams after winning just five games five years ago. The Minutemen continued their rise to the top winning the program's first-ever Hockey East tournament title to enter the NCAA tournament on a high note.

NCAA tournament

When the puck dropped for the NCAA tournament UMass continued to show it was one of the best teams in the country. The Minutemen defeated its regional opponents by a combined score of 9-1 to advance to the Frozen Four. However the success on the ice came with bad news off the ice as four players were contract-traced for COVID-19 keeping them out for the Frozen Four semifinals. Goalies Filip Lindberg and Henry Graham and forwards Carson Gicewicz and Jerry Harding did not make the trip to Pittsburgh for the semifinals.

Frozen Four semifinals

Once in Pittsburgh UMass entered the Frozen Four against reigning champion Minnesota Duluth as the Minutemen looked to avenge their 2019 3-0 championship loss. Early on Minnesota Duluth showed signs of dominance as it did in the previous meeting outshooting UMass 26-11 through two periods. However UMass never went away tying the game 2-2 with 8:25 in the third period before heading into overtime. In an overtime thriller UMass was able to flip the switch and outshoot Minnesota Duluth 13-2 before ultimately scoring the game-winning goal to advance.

Key players this season

Goaltenders Matt Murray and Filip Lindberg

COVID protocols make each goaltender a key player for the Minutemen. Goaltender Matt Murray was thrown into net for the semifinals after Lindberg was out due to COVID protocols. Up until that point UMass hadn’t lost in its last 13 games but all with Lindberg in net. However Murray had 36 saves against Minnesota Duluth holding his own to help his team get the win.

“He's a good goalie and he made saves that he needed to tonight” said Carvel on Murray’s performance. “I give him a lot of credit for how well he's practiced and his effort and his attitude.""

While all signs point to Lindberg’s return on Saturday night Murray remains a key player in case of the unexpected.

Forward Carson Gicewicz

As the leading goal scorer for the Minutemen Gicewicz’s return is highly anticipated. His hat trick in the regional final put his importance on full display. During his absence in the semifinals UMass struggled during regulation to get shots on goal. If Gicewicz can clear COVID protocol for Saturday’s game the Minutemen offense should get a boost for its most important game.

Defenseman Zac Jones

It’s often said that defense wins championships and UMass defenseman Zac Jones hopes that the cliche proves true. Jones leads the Minutemen in Blocks and is a key defensive force on the ice. But in the NCAA tournament Jones has been able to contribute on the offensive end as well. Jones had three assists in the tournament’s opening round against Lake Superior St. He also scored UMass’ opening goal in the Frozen Four on a power play to give it an early 1-0 lead. While defense may win championships Jones’ well-rounded performance on both ends will be key to the Minutemen’s title hopes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9zdC1jbG91ZC1zdGF0ZS1zLXJ1bi1lbmRzLXdpdGgtc2h1dG91dC1sb3NzLWluLWZyb3plbi1mb3VyLXRpdGxlLWdhbWUvNjAwMDQ0NjMxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. Cloud State's run ends with shutout loss in Frozen Four title game,"PITTSBURGH -- St. Cloud State vanquished two of the top teams from Hockey East Boston University and Boston College on its way to the second Frozen Four berth in program history but it turned out beating a third team from that conference was one task too many for the Huskies.

Behind a suffocating defensive effort and a 25-save shutout from goalie Filip Lindberg Massachusetts defeated St. Cloud State 5-0 on Saturday night in the NCAA men's Frozen Four championship game at PPG Paints Arena. Instead of winning their first national championship the Huskies saw the Minutemen skate off with their first crown after finishing runner-up to Minnesota Duluth two years ago.

In the process the Minutemen (20-5-4) were the last men standing from a Frozen Four that featured three Minnesota teams for the first time – the Huskies UMD and Minnesota State Mankato. St. Cloud State (20-11) was shut out for the first time since Dec. 13 and only the second time this season.

UMass got goals from five different players – Aaron Bohlinger Reed Lebster Philip Lagunov Matthew Kessel and Bobby Trivigno – and rode the momentum of a penalty kill that went 3-for-3 – and supplied a spectacular shorthanded goal by Lagunov.

Lindberg who missed Thursday's 3-2 overtime semifinal victory over Minnesota Duluth while in COVID-19 protocol kept the Huskies in check all night. He faced only six shots through the game's first 30 minutes as the Minutemen built a 3-0 lead.

Huskies goalie David Hrenak made 17 saves.

St. Cloud State had the game's first good scoring chance 1:30 into the first period when Veeti Miettinen stole the puck at center ice made a move into the UMass zone and rifled a shot off the crossbar.

The Huskies had sustained pressure in the UMass zone near the 6:00 mark but Minutemen defenseman Ty Farmer passed to start a breakaway that became two-on-none after a pair of Huskies collided at the blue line. Bohlinger a freshman defenseman finished it taking a pass from Ryan Sullivan and scoring before Hrenak could slide over for a 1-0 lead at 7:26.

The Huskies got the game's first power play at 15:27 when Anthony Del Gaizo was whistled for slashing. Huskies fans howled for another penalty when a Massachusetts player grabbed the puck out of the air and literally threw it out of the zone after Lindberg made a save on Zach Okabe. That helped the Minutemen kill the penalty.

UMass extended the lead to 2-0 at 18:56 when Lebster slammed home a wraparound pass by Cal Kiefiuk who won a puck battle along the boards to start the play.

The Minutemen got their first power play 24 seconds into the second period when Huskies defenseman Seamus Donohue was called for tripping. The Huskies killed the penalty with Hrenak needing to make only one save.

St. Cloud State got its second power play at 3:57 of the second when Sullivan went to the box for tripping. Instead of cutting into the UMass lead the Huskies saw the deficit grow to 3-0 on a shorthanded goal when Lagunov gathered an errant Huskies pass sped into the St. Cloud State zone toe-dragged around defenseman Nick Perbix and beat Hrenak at 5:10.

St. Cloud State got its third power play at 10:31 of the second when Jake Gaudet was called for elbowing. The Minutemen killed that one too and the Huskies were whistled for too many men on the ice at 12:35. Kessel made the Huskies pay with a rocket from the point at 13:50 for a 4-0 UMass lead.

Trivigno boosted the UMass lead to 5-0 at 6:00 of the third period with a blast from the top left circle past Hrenak.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvY29sbGVnZS9ob2NrZXkvMjAyMS8wNC8xMC9uY2FhLWhvY2tleS1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtbWFzc2FjdXNldHRzLWJlYXRzLXVtYXNzLzcxNzkyMjAwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Massachusetts routs St. Cloud State to win first men's NCAA hockey championship,"The Associated Press

PITTSBURGH – Filip Lindberg had 25 saves Aaron Bohlinger scored his first career goal and Massachusetts beat St. Cloud State 5-0 on Saturday night to win the program’s first NCAA title.

After St. Cloud State turnover Bohlinger led a breakaway and dropped the puck to Ryan Sullivan whose one-touch pass set up Bohlinger’s one-timer to open the scoring about 7 minutes into the game. Reed Lebster’s wrap-around goal with about a minute left in the first gave the Minutemen a 2-0 lead.

UMass (20-5-4) which extended its unbeaten streak to a program-record 14 games made its third NCAA Tournament appearance. The Minutemen lost 3-0 to Minnesota Duluth – which UMass beat in Thursday’s semifinals – in the 2019 title game. The 2020 Frozen Four was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.

David Hrenak had 17 saves for St. Cloud State (20-11-0) which made the program’s first title game appearance.

Phillip Lagunov picked up a loose puck near center ice cut back to evade a defender and scored a short-handed goal about five minutes into the second period to make it 3-0.

Matthew Kessel added a power-play goal about eight minutes later and Bobby Trivigno capped the scoring in the third period.

After being announced last month I was able to find the Dynatron A38 quickly in stock at Internet retailers. I ended up picking up the Dynatron A38 for $49 USD from NewEgg.

Testing was done with the Dynatron A38 and compared to the earlier Dynatron A26 as well as being compared to a 4U-optimized Noctua NH-U9 TR4-SP3 heatsink with dual fans. All of the testing occurred within a Rosewill 4U chassis with three 120mm Noctua intake fans and three 80mm exhaust fans throughout all the testing for sufficient airflow for this AMD EPYC Milan server.

The AMD EPYC 7763 280 Watt 64 core / 128 thread CPU was running with the Supermicro H12SSL-i motherboard and 8 x 16GB DDR4-3200 memory and 3.8TB Micron 9300 NVMe SSD.

With each of the tested Socket SP3 coolers in this 4U AMD EPYC 7763 server a wide variety of workloads were run for 8+ hours during testing via the Phoronix Test Suite while it was monitoring the exposed CPU core temperature on a one second interval. The ambient room temperature was of course maintained during testing.

In total 106 benchmarks were run each time while monitoring the CPU core temperatures for the different CPU coolers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlcnZldGhlaG9tZS5jb20vY2lzY28tdWNzLW02LXNlcmllcy1hZGRzLTNyZC1nZW4taW50ZWwteGVvbi1pY2UtbGFrZS1zdXBwb3J0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cisco UCS M6 Series Adds 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Ice Lake Support,"Cisco UCS has been around for some time and as one would expect Cisco’s server line has been updated with the new Intel Xeon Ice Lake processors. The new generation offers perhaps the largest generational upgrade in technology since 2012 and the Intel Xeon E5-2600 V1 series.

Cisco UCS C220 M6 UCS C240 M6 and UCS B200 M6 Servers

Cisco has three models it is upgrading with Ice Lake Xeon. First we are going to cover the UCS B200 M6 then the C240 M6 and finally the C220 M6. This order was decided by the cover image we made above which is the opposite of the AMD EPYC 7003 Cisco UCS launch cover.

Cisco UCS B200 M6

The blade offering is the Cisco UCS B200 M6. This is a dual-socket node that can support 40 core Xeon CPUs which is impressive from a cooling perspective.

Here are the key specs:

1-2 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable Processors (with up to 40 cores per socket)

32 DIMM slots (16 DIMMs per CPU socket) 3200 MHz DDR4 or 16x DDR4 + 16x Optane PMem 200

Cisco UCS Virtual Interface Card (VIC) 1440 modular LAN on Motherboard (mLOM)

One rear slot for VIC (Cisco UCS VIC 1480 or port expander)

One front dedicated slot for a Cisco FlexStorage RAID controller Cisco FlexStorage passthrough or Cisco M.2 RAID controller

Up to two SAS/SATA/NVMe disk drives or up to four M.2 drives

Overall this is a fairly standard blade offering for Cisco but it has the impact of increasing core counts and memory significantly.

Cisco UCS C240 M6

The Cisco USC C240 M6 is the company’s 2U offering. As such it has a much higher degree of expansion capabilities.

Key specs include:

1-2 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable Processors (with up to 40 cores per socket)

32 DIMM slots (16 DIMMs per CPU socket) 3200 MHz DDR4 or 16x DDR4 + 16x Optane PMem 200

Up to eight PCIe Gen4 slots plus modular LAN on Motherboard (mLOM) slot and support for up to five GPUs

Support for Cisco UCS VIC 1400 Series adapters as well as third-party options

Up to 28 SAS/SATA/NVMe disk drives

RAID and M.2 boot options available

Overall this is a fairly standard 2U offering in the industry.

Cisco UCS C220 M6

For higher density applications than the C240 M6 2U system offers Cisco has its 1U offering.

Here are the key specs of the Cisco UCS C220 M6:

1-2 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable Processors (with up to 40 cores per socket)

32 DIMM slots (16 DIMMs per CPU socket) 3200 MHz DDR4 or 16x DDR4 + 16x Optane PMem 200

Up to three PCIe Gen4 slots plus modular LAN on Motherboard (mLOM) slot and support for up to two GPUs

Support for Cisco UCS VIC 1400 Series adapters as well as third-party options

Up to 10 SAS/SATA/NVMe disk drives

RAID and M.2 boot options available

Here one can see that the impact of moving to the 1U form factor is that we lose support for five PCIe slots and three GPUs we also can only get up to 10x 2.5″ drives instead of up to 28x on the 2U offering.

Final Words

Cisco has fewer server offerings than many of its competitors. Dell EMC for example has blade servers but also a wide range of rack servers. Supermicro has over 100 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable designs. Still it is good to see that Cisco is updating UCS and it now has a relatively close parity between its Intel Ice Lake and AMD EPYC 7003 “Milan” designs in the Cisco UCS M6 series.

This week we will analyze the events of the past two weeks with a particular focus on T-Mobile’s Home Internet Uncarrier announcement last Thursday.

Before diving into the rest of the Brief congratulations to two companies who have been good friends over the last decade. Regional data center company DC Blox headed by Cbeyond veterans Jeff Uphues Mark Masi and Chris Gatch reported on March 29 that they had raised $187 million from Post Road Group and Bain Capital to continue their Southeast expansion. We will cover more on their progress in next week’s “Up and Comers” post. We like to think of DC Blox in the same manner as we thought about regional middle-mile fiber providers in the 2000s – making long-term investments with a commercial real estate/ telecom balance.

Also longtime friend and Kansas City-based entrepreneur Rob Oyler announced last Friday that WANRack would be purchased by the investment arm of real estate giant CBRE (press release here). Having known Rob and most of the WANrack team since they formed the company in 2012 (including many meetings at Broadway Coffee in Kansas City that year) it has been terrific seeing them grow and invest. WANRack now has over 68 school networks covering 23 states with many more in construction thanks to a strong 2020. Kudos to all involved.

The week that was

“POP!” is the best word to describe last week’s Fab Five market activity. Over the last two weeks their market capitalization has risen $757 billion and the cumulative market capitalization is just shy of $8.3 trillion. As we disclosed on Friday all of this gain happened the week of April 5 ($785 billion gain from 4/5-4/9 vs $28 billion loss from 3/29-4/2). As best we can tell this is the best single weekly performance ever for the Fab Five. Even Apple who for the 1st quarter of 2021 seemed content to hold on to 2020 gains is now in positive territory. What happened?

As our economy recovers from the COVID-induced recession those companies with healthy balance sheets will accelerate hiring product development marketing and capital investments to improve their competitiveness. The Fab Five had $607 billion in cash and marketable securities entering 2021 with a collective $218 billion in short and long-term debt (a figure that is within $30 billion of AT&T’s projected Q1 debt) . They refused to choke on cheap debt and made most if not all of their 2020 acquisitions in cash (it also didn’t hurt that they weren’t bidders in the C-Band auction). Google Amazon and Microsoft stand to gain from their growing cloud computing businesses while Google and Facebook should also benefit from an improved advertising outlook.

A good case in point is the HoloLens contract awarded to Microsoft by the Department of Defense (announcement here). According to Ars Technica The total value over the next ten years could approach $22 billion (which makes all the fighting over the $10 billion Jedi contract look small). Applying low latency augmented/ mixed reality and instant feedback to prepare for the net war would seem to be something Verizon perhaps in collaboration with Lockheed would trumpet. Did Microsoft just scoop a key 5G use case and steal someone’s thunder? As a matter of fact they did.

To recap Apple gained $198 billion in the last two weeks (the equivalent of 1.2 T-Mobiles in value in a fortnight) Google gained $169 billion Amazon gained $161 billion Microsoft gained $146 billion and Facebook $84 billion. They are on pace to exceed last year’s $2.5 trillion of incremental market cap gains. And if that weren’t enough Amazon fought off an intense effort to unionize their Bessemer Alabama facility (why it failed in a landslide is covered quite well in this New York Times article as well as this Wall Street Journal article).

Meanwhile the Telco Top Five continue to hold on to their 2020 gains. T-Mobile erased half of their 2021 losses (+$8 billion) while Comcast lost $8 billion (inexplicable in our view) and the rest largely marked time. One bright spot for AT&T was the release of Godzilla vs. Kong which has grossed $48 million in domestic box office sales (plus and additional $237 million globally) according to BoxOfficeMojo.com. While the latest blockbuster will not be reflected until 2Q 2021 earnings WarnerMedia’s “day and date” change appears to have been a wise move (in addition to the numbers above Deadline estimates that over 3.6 million households watched at least five minutes of Godzilla vs. Kong over the Easter holiday weekend making it the most watched debut in HBO Max’s short history).

As we have mentioned in other Briefs AT&T is going to increasingly use their content to transform their customer relationships and brand. As we emerge from the pandemic this summer it would not be surprising to see AT&T reinforce moviegoing traditions with some promotion (free or discounted tickets for all new AT&T/ HBO Max customers to selected titles would be innovative and profitable).

Network quality metrics also were updated over the last two weeks. T-Mobile trumpeted their latest results from global testing firm umlaut (results here) which found T-Mobile had the largest fastest and most accessible 5G network in 44 of 50 states (Alaska Arkansas Nebraska Rhode Island South Dakota and Vermont were split between Verizon and AT&T). While this is indicative of the significant progress T-Mobile has made since the merger closed a year ago our tracking of RootMetrics Metro RootScore reports (here) shows that they still have a ways to go.

As the nearby table shows RootMetrics has published the results of 55 out of 125 metro areas (measured every six months). Unlike other testing agencies RootMetrics uses the same device across all carriers (a Samsung S20+ or Note 20 5G device). The results continue a trend we have discussed in previous Briefs: AT&T is challenging Verizon’s long-held pole position at RootMetrics with over half of the markets categorized as a two or three-way tie. These include larger metro areas such as St. Louis (19th largest MSA in the USA) Denver (#20) San Antonio (#24) and Austin (#29). While T-Mobile has also improved they are not showing up in the winner column with the same frequency as AT&T. We expect to see outright T-Mobile wins beginning in 2H 2021 as they complete their upgraded network rollouts to more MSAs. For a good indication of T-Mobile’s progress check out the Philadelphia RootScore results released last week here. The City of Brotherly Love was one of T-Mobile’s first 5G markets and their progress shows with wins in Network Speed and Data Performance.

Is T-Mobile a credible home internet provider?

T-Mobile dominated the communications sector news flow over the past two weeks announcing:

The shutdown of TVision (March 29) An expansion of their relationship with Google including an aggressive YouTube TV promotion to all T-Mobile subscribers (March 29) A enterprise-focused partnership with Level(3)/ Lumen (April 6) Free Samsung Galaxy A32 5G phones to new and existing customers (April 7). Link for items d-f is here A compelling switching offer to AT&T and Verizon customers subscribing to legacy “bucket” rate plans The rollout of Home Internet service to 30 million homes (April 7)

We could fill many Briefs discussing these topics (especially the cozier relationship with Level(3)/ Lumen) but will focus this week on the Home internet proposition. Below we compare T-Mobile to the incumbent telco (CenturyLink/ Lumen Verizon DSL and AT&T) as well as the incumbent cable company (Comcast and Spectrum) for both stand-alone Internet as well as an Internet + TV double play. There’s a lot of information below and we are glad to share our analysis upon request.

To test the value of T-Mobile’s Home Internet service we randomly pulled three addresses from Greeley CO (80634) and Reading PA (19601) and used our former home address in Dallas TX (75244). The first location in Greeley is on the southwest side of town (zip code population = 66043 and grew 25% over the last decade. Average home value according to Zillow is ~$380000 and grew at 6.7% last year). Nearby is the serviceability result we received from CenturyLink.

This result is anything but great. A community growing population at 25% with an average home value at $380000 and mid-single digit growth deserves a corresponding bandwidth choice. 1.5 Mbps for $64/ mo is a dismal alternative.

Comcast had a much more compelling alternative with 200 Mbps downstream service available for $49.99/ mo. on a 12-month contract. But the XFi device is an additional $14.99/ mo. bringing the total cost to $64.99 for stand-alone Internet. And the renewal cost is $70/ mo. ($85/ mo. with modem).

Here’s the service map for the particular address in question (by LTE service band). You can see from this map that the address would receive excellent low-band service and good mid-band. (2.5 GHz may not have been deployed in Greeley yet). On T-Mobile’s 5G map coverage is listed as “fair” so it’s more likely that data would be provided through the LTE network.

T-Mobile’s service includes also the option to purchase YouTube TV for $54.99 (+ taxes). So the double play package would come in at $60 for Internet (modem taxes & fees included) and $54.99 for TV – roughly $115/ mo. plus the cost to pick up a Roku Apple TV or Amazon Fire TV if you don’t already own a smart TV (full compatibility here).

The $115/ mo. is slightly less expensive than Comcast’s new customer pricing once local broadcast fees and regional sports fees are baked in – their double play runs $80.00/mo. for the first year (+$14.99/ mo. cable modem + $14.99/ mo. to connect two TVs + $9 regional broadcast fees + $8 regional sports fee). So $12/ more for Comcast in the first year but $22/ mo. more after the new customer promotions have expired.

The bottom line for T-Mobile’s prospects for Greeley: Much better than Lumen and slightly better than Comcast (unless the family needs the extra 100 Mbps download speeds).

In a more populated area like Reading PA (city with 89000 population and a high percentage living below the poverty line) T-Mobile offers a very compelling alternative to Verizon (this is a non-FiOS area). Using a downtown residential location we were able to easily locate both excellent 5G and very strong LTE coverage. Verizon’s 1.1-3.0 Mbps service costs $40/ mo. but includes a free modem. No other services are offered. A nonstarter for sure.

Like we saw with Greeley Comcast is the provider for Reading and their offer is essentially the same but the added TV fees are slightly higher. The result is $13 more for a TV + Internet bundle versus YouTube TV + T-Mobile Home Internet in the first year of Comcast’s promotion and $23 more for the second year and beyond.

Finally we look at the Preston Hollow area of Dallas Texas (zip code 75224; 18% population growth over the last decade; average home value $524K with 7.4% growth in 2020). Like the Reading address coverage could not be better for T-Mobile Home Internet service.

This is not the case for AT&T Fiber. While AT&T covers much of the zip code with their latest technology (~72%) the specific address we checked (our former address) did not have AT&T Fiber offered. But they did offer an “up to” 75 Mbps service for $55/ mo. including modem cost. Again very disappointing results for a great neighborhood where homes recently sold for $850K and up to have subpar broadband options.

Fortunately Spectrum services this area with cable and their double play is attractive for the first two years of service (existing customers will be more likely to consider T-Mobile Home Internet as an alternative than new movers). Spectrum’s costs are shown nearby. Note the Broadcast TV surcharge of $16.45 per month. That masks a relatively attractive price for a 400 Mbps service (the lowest offered online) and a generous TV offer.

Bottom line: T-Mobile’s offering is going to be much more attractive than folks think particularly for double play. Where AT&T does not offer fiber (which we have discussed above is more parts of town than most realize) costs are high and speeds are lower then Home Internet. Cable TV costs carry broadcast and equipment rental fees that easily add $25-30/ month to the headline rate. After introductory pricing expires T-Mobile’s offer becomes even more attractive. Dropping TVision for YouTube TV was a difficult yet smart move as the examples show. Unlike cable T-Mobile would not be able to follow the “surcharge” model that Comcast and Spectrum regularly use.

The question then becomes “If T-Mobile intended Home Internet to be a user of excess capacity and demand is far greater than expected will they ration or limit the number of customers the service is available to after they have hit their fill rate?” Home Internet will definitely generate excess cash flow (especially at $60/ mo.) but eventually it will trigger new transport circuit orders (10 Gbps becomes multiple 10 Gbps). Can Home Internet scale? Will T-Mobile be able to directly connect YouTube TV servers in a given geographic area directly to the tower to minimize any latency? How will network redundancy minimize the impact of transport outages?

Most importantly will a positive Home Internet experience bring new families into the T-Mobile prepaid and postpaid fold? We remember Mike Sievert’s disclosure that 35% of the Home Internet pilot customers were new to T-Mobile. While we were originally skeptical that a $60 price point would fly it’s now looking competitive in markets where cable has little incentive to extend renewal incentives and the telco option is subpar. And the Netflix bundling options have yet to be tested.

That’s it for this week. We will add three new “Up and Comers” (one of them DC Blox) and also provide a summary of carrier earnings expectations in next week’s Brief. Until then if you have friends who would like to be on the email distribution please have them send an email to [email protected] and we will include them on the list (or they can sign up directly through the new website).

When it was finally confirmed Avi Greengart a longtime consumer tech analyst and president of Techsponential noticed a trend toward nostalgia in the reactions to the news.

“I’m not getting a lot of people saying ‘What will I do to replace my LG G8X ThinQ?’ I’m getting ‘Aw my first phone was an LG flip phone and it was durable and reliable and I loved it.’”

As someone who spent many years covering the digital camera market it’s a very familiar moment to me. We mourn the loss of the brand that gave us our first flip phone or our first camera with a tweet and a broken heart emoji. But truthfully we moved on long ago as did most of the rest of the phone- or camera-buying population.

Through last year LG still held close to 10 percent market share in the US

Things weren’t looking good for LG’s phone business in 2016 when it introduced the modular G5 and the ecosystem’s failure to take off perpetuated what would become years of losses for the mobile division. In 2020 the smartphone business recorded an operational loss of around $750 million for the year; the company promised to “closely review the direction of the business” and we know now how that turned out.

While most shoppers have moved on there are still gaps left in the market when a Kodak or an LG packs it in. “This is a void. When they do leave this will be a void” says Ryan Reith program vice president for IDC’s Mobile Device Tracker division. He says that through last year LG still held close to 10 percent market share in the US.

In particular the company still had a solid foothold in the prepaid device business. Greengart doesn’t think there will be any lack of appetite to snap up that share of the market. “The competition there is brutal. The real question is will US carriers invite a new brand in — someone like Xiaomi would be my longshot.” The company’s Redmi and Poco lineups might be good candidates with a focus on bringing high-end features and solid performance to affordable handsets.

“The real question is will US carriers invite a new brand in — someone like Xiaomi would be my longshot.”

Greengart also notes that OnePlus already has a foot in the door at Metro by T-Mobile the carrier’s prepaid sub-brand. Samsung has already announced that it will sell two of its least expensive A-series phones the A02s and A12 through prepaid brands like Cricket and Metro this spring.

As for the sub-$300 space in general there’s no shortage of brands ready to pounce. “I would say the two brands that are probably going to take that share going to be Motorola and TCL” Reith says. He notes that Motorola is already well-positioned to pick up LG’s Latin American customers which was recently about 30 percent of its mobile phone business. Even on an individual device level there are obvious heirs: one of LG’s last bestselling devices is the Stylo 6 and its sole competitor the Moto G Stylus is quite frankly a better phone.

TCL has also made it clear in the past couple of years that it’s eager to get its own brand devices into more consumers’ hands in addition to the phones the company already makes for other brands. Reith says he’s “bullish” on the company’s prospects as more US shoppers have become familiar with the brand name by way of its TV business. If one thing’s certain it’s that more than a few companies are in a good position to fill that void LG leaves behind. As Greengart puts it “Undoubtedly there will be plenty of substitutes; in fact there already are.”

“Undoubtedly there will be plenty of substitutes; in fact there already are.”

Although LG only had a small presence in the premium market there’s a gap left there too — even if it’s mostly symbolic. The few devices the company still sold were an alternative to the two dominant brands in the US: Apple and Samsung. Especially considering the lower cost of entry to the S21 series this year those remaining customers will likely be easily scooped up by the duopoly. “The market is mostly Apple and Samsung in the United States” says Greengart. “If it was concentrated before it’s even more concentrated today.”

Realistically though the market had already spoken. LG’s efforts at bold unusual designs in the premium space never caught on and spelled serious trouble for the business. Reith points to the LG Wing as an example. “To come up with a design like that… it takes so much money for R&D that when you put that out and it only sells thousands of units — not hundreds of thousands but thousands of units — it’s a big big loss” he says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vd2hhdC1pcy01Z2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is 5GE and How Does It Differ From 5G?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vd2hhdC1pcy01Z2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL3RoZS1rbGFuLXBlb3BsZS12cy1rdS1rbHV4LWNubi8xMDUwODY2MS_SAURodHRwczovL2FiYzdjaGljYWdvLmNvbS9hbXAvdGhlLWtsYW4tcGVvcGxlLXZzLWt1LWtsdXgtY25uLzEwNTA4NjYxLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The People v.

At first Cecelia Perry thought she knew what happened to her younger brother when he failed to return from a late-night trip to a service station on March 20 1981.

Nineteen-year-old Michael Donald was thoughtful and responsible -- working at night and watching Perry's oldest son during the day. He'd been with Perry at another sister's home in Mobile Alabama when he stepped out around 11 p.m. to pick up cigarettes. As the hour grew later with no sign of him ""everybody assumed that he'd gone home to my mom"" Perry says in CNN's docuseries ""The People v. The Klan.""

But Michael wasn't there. While out on his errand the teenager was abducted at gunpoint by two members of the Ku Klux Klan who viciously beat killed and then lynched the teenager. The next morning Michael's body was found hanging from a tree on the residential Herndon Avenue.

The racist hatred that led to Donald's death and his mother Beulah Mae Donald's fight for justice is explored in the CNN Original Series ""The People v. The Klan"" airing Sunday at 9 p.m. ET/PT.

Here's a guide to the key events in the lynching of Michael Donald and the cases that followed.

THE CRIME

March 20 1981

In the CNN series Michael Donald's sister Cecelia Perry describes her brother as quiet and well-mannered. The youngest child of Beulah Mae Donald he worked in the mailroom of the Mobile Press-Register and was studying to be a brick mason.

""If he came home and I was lying down he'd do you know little things to help"" Perry says.

""That's the kind of boy he was.""

He spent his last night alive with his family watching a basketball game.

""We were all gathered at my oldest sister's house Betty"" Perry recalls. ""We would always sit around on Friday night 'cause she lived right round the corner from my mom. ... My niece Vanessa said 'I need some cigarettes.' Michael said 'I'll walk up there and get 'em.'""

March 20 - 21 1981

While out walking Donald was stopped by two White men in a vehicle asking for directions. It was a ruse -- once Donald paused to help one of the men produced a gun and forced Donald into their car.

The two Klansmen Henry Hays and James ""Tiger"" Knowles then took Donald to a secluded location where they beat him strangled him and cut his throat. They then took his body back to a residential area of Mobile where they hung his body from a tree.

That night members of the same local Klan chapter also burned a cross on the lawn at the Mobile County courthouse.

March 21 1981

Word spread quickly through Mobile about the lynching as police arrived on the scene. Donald's wallet was found in a dumpster with an ID card inside identifying the body that hung on Herndon Avenue as Michael Anthony Donald.

Police learned that day that Klansmen were in the area; Bennie Jack Hays the second-highest-ranking Klansman in the state owned the property across the street from where Donald's body was found.

""Nobody saw anything nobody heard anything"" former Mobile homicide detective Wilbur Williams says in the CNN series. ""We just started investigating everything we could.""

THE INVESTIGATION

March 25 1981

Police arrested three men they believed to be involved in Donald's death: Ralph Eugene Hayes and two brothers named Jimmy and Johnny Edgar (a trio that as it would turn out had nothing to do with it). The three had been involved in a domestic disturbance a few blocks away and a tipster named Johnny Ray Kelly claimed to have seen the men in the area that Friday night.

Kelly told police he'd noticed what looked like blood on Hayes' clothes. Kelly said he asked Hayes about it and that the man responded that he'd ""jumped a Black dude"" former Mobile District Attorney Chris Galanos recalls in the CNN series.

The detectives Cecelia Perry says began to inquire about whether her brother was involved in drugs which the family knew wasn't true.

""Mobile had a fairly significant late-night street population. Talking about drug addicts"" Williams says. ""So we obtained permission to search Michael's room. And basically found nothing in his bedroom.""

Adds Perry ""We had to just live and work through it because we knew that he was just an innocent person. He was innocent in this.""

March 28 1981

Michael's mother Beulah Mae Donald held an open-casket funeral saying that she wanted the world to see the horror that had been inflicted on her son.

""I didn't even know what he looked like as my child"" Beulah Mae Donald said. ""The undertaker didn't want me to see where they'd made a footprint on his face with their boots.""

April 1981

Along with her attorney Alabama state Sen. Michael Figures Beulah Mae Donald and the local Black community protested and pushed the Mobile Police Department not to lose sight of justice for Michael Donald. Rev. Jesse Jackson came to Mobile helping the case to gain national attention.

June 6 1981

The three men initially charged in Donald's death were released after a grand jury determined the charges were based on perjured testimony.

It turned out the key witness Johnny Ray Kelly had his own legal troubles -- and the story he'd told police was a lie.

""It was really depressing -- you couldn't eat you couldn't think of nothing else 'cause our life had just come to a standstill"" Donald's sister Cecelia Perry says. She adds that despite the efforts of the Black community ""the Mobile Police Department they sat on it and they would just call and say 'we haven't forgotten you Ms. Donald we still working on the case.' Oh OK. Do something about it.""

Then Sen. Michael Figures and his brother Thomas Figures at the time an Assistant United States Attorney steadily applied pressure on the Justice Department to examine the case.

January 1983

Now retired FBI special agent James Bodman was tapped to look into the murder of Michael Donald.

""The head of the FBI office came up to me and laid a paper file on my desk and he said 'Jim take this case. The Justice Department they will not allow us to close the case'"" Bodman says in the CNN series. ""And I asked him I said 'Sir what do you think I'm gonna do with it? I understand everybody in town's been interviewed three times.' He said 'You take this case and you work it.' ... I get the case. They supposedly kept saying 'It was a drug case gone bad. It was not a racial case. It was a drug case gone bad.' That was not the issue.""

Bodman began to investigate. ""Donald had been hung on a tree the same block where this group of Klan lived and I'm thinking 'Gee whiz what better place to start?'"" the now-former agent said. ""So I started interviewing these people and I approached them with the idea they were not the subject of that investigation other than the fact I want your information. I want to know what you know. And the more I ask questions the more they talked.""

May 1983

Authorities continued to investigate several members of the Klavern 900 the area chapter of the United Klans of America and called some to testify before a federal grand jury.

June 1983

One of Donald's killers James ""Tiger"" Knowles confessed. He implicated Henry Hays the other Klansman who helped him kill Donald that March night in 1981 and both men were arrested. Hays pleaded not guilty.

THE CAPITAL MURDER TRIAL

December 6 1983

Hays' capital murder trial began with Knowles testifying against him after pleading guilty to a federal charge of violating Michael Donald's civil rights.

""The agreement was (that) since Tiger had incriminated Henry Hays Tiger would be allowed to plead guilty to a civil rights violation in the Federal system and was to have been sentenced to a life term and then we would try Henry in state court for capital murder"" former Mobile District Attorney Chris Galanos explains in the docuseries. And by trying Hays in the state of Alabama the prosecution was able to seek the death penalty.

December 8 1983

Knowles testified against Hays going into detail about how -- and why -- Donald was killed. The same week of Donald's murder Knowles said there was a different criminal case that had the attention of Mobile Klansmen: The trial of a Black man named Josephus Anderson.

Anderson was accused of killing a White police officer in an earlier robbery. When the jury couldn't reach a verdict the case ended in a mistrial. Knowles testified that he and Hays went ""hunting"" for a Black person for revenge.

""The Klan wanted the message to get back to the Black people of not just Alabama but the whole United States that we would not stand for a Black person killing a White police officer and getting away with it"" Knowles testified. ""Especially in Alabama. We'd gotten the rope and we got the gun and then I tied the hangman's noose in Henry's car. We were out on a hunt.""

December 19 1983

The jury found Hays guilty of capital murder and recommended life without parole.

February 1984

An Alabama judge instead gave Henry Hays the death penalty.

THE CIVIL TRIAL

June 1984

With Hays sentenced to death and Knowles facing life in prison the men who brutally assaulted and killed the 19-year-old were finally punished.

But the Klan the organization that bred the hate behind Knowles' and Hays' crime was still a threat. Beulah Mae Donald's lawyer then Sen. Michael Figures along with Morris Dees the co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center filed an over $10 million civil suit against the United Klans of America and others.

""My mother she say 'The worst has already been done'"" Cecelia Perry remembers in the CNN series. ""'My child is gone. I want to make them pay for what they've done to my child.'""

February 12 1987

After hearing Donald's case an all-White jury awarded a $7 million judgment. The sum was so significant that it effectively bankrupted the United Klans of America which was known as one of the largest and most violent KKK factions.

In an attempt to pay some of the damages owed the United Klans of America turned over its headquarters in Tuscaloosa Alabama to Beulah Mae Donald. She sold the building and used the money to buy her first home.

THE AFTERMATH

September 1988

Beulah Mae Donald died at the age of 67. Before her death she was honored by Ms. Magazine as the publication's 1987 Woman of the Year.

""I wanted to know who all really killed my child'' she said in response according to The New York Times. ''I wasn't even thinking about the money. If I hadn't gotten a cent it wouldn't have mattered. I wanted to know how and why they did it.''

June 1997

Henry Hays was executed in Alabama. It was the first time since 1913 that a White person had been put to death for a crime committed against a Black person in the state.

May 2006

Herndon Avenue the street where Michael Donald's body was found was renamed in his honor around 25 years after his death.

A similar hack involving scraped personal data for 500 million LinkedIn accounts was also disclosed and the massive database of info was on sale online earlier this week. Then we saw a different data leak that allowed people to obtain the phone numbers of Facebook users who liked a page on the social network. Next up a large number of credit card records and Social Security numbers were hacked on a platform that sells this type of stolen information — that’s to say that data had been stolen before this security exploit but now it has been made available more widely. Finally we also saw malware-spreading Android apps in the wild again and Facebook allowed ads for a malware app on its platform.

To top it all off there’s another vulnerability that millions of people need to be aware of. A small mobile operator failed to protect its customers’ personal data so anyone was able to access account information by simply inputting a phone number into a mobile app.

The carrier in question is Q Link Wireless a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) with around 2 million US customers. A Reddit user first found the security vulnerability a few months ago attempting to notify the carrier a few times via customer support and app reviews that highlighted the bug. Ars Technica followed up on that post and its inquiries might have convinced Q Link Wireless to finally fix the security issue.

The “hack” allowed anyone to install the carrier’s My Mobile Account and then input any customer’s phone number to access the data associated with that account. No password was needed and the information was accessible to anyone aware of the security issue.

The mobile app offers tons of information about users. Examples include a user’s first and last name home address phone call history (outgoing/incoming) text message history (outgoing/incoming) account number email address and last four digits of the associated payment card.

The app can’t be used to make any changes to someone’s account or harm the phone number via a SIM swap or locking someone out. But Ars says that a would-be SIM swapper might try to use the data to social engineer a Q Link Wireless employee into helping. A more simple type of attack involves spying on victims. People aware of the vulnerability could have used the security flaw to keep track of someone’s calls and texts. Abusive spouses stalkers and other people with malicious intentions who might target a particular victim could have done this with ease.

After ignoring the problem for months Q Link Wireless appears to have fixed it so the data is no longer available to anyone with knowledge of a phone number. It’s unclear if the vulnerability was abused with security firm Intel471 telling Ars that it did not find discussions about this particular security flaw on forums frequently used by hackers and criminals. But the report points out there’s no way to know if the leak had been abused on a smaller scale.

It generated a massive amount of negative publicity because the terms of the offer were as follows:

$9.20 cash per share for the 35% of LD Nathan owned by Fay Richwhite and

One Lion share for every one LD Nathan share for all other shareholders.

As Lion shares were worth $6 at the time Fay Richwhite received a premium of $3.20 or 53% compared with all other shareholders.

Media coverage of the merger was intense because of its dual-pricing mechanism and because the boards of the two companies contained many of New Zealand’s leading businessmen at the time.

Board compositions – early 1988 Lion Corporation LD Nathan Gordon Tait (Chair) Keith Coe (Chair) Michael Fam Peter Cooper (MD) John Fernyhough Robin Congreve Alan Gibbs Malcolm Don Doug Myers (MD) Chris Mace George Pearce Syd Pasley David Scott Geoff Ricketts Mike Smith Bill Shaw Johannes van der Werf David Steele

Fam & van der Werf represented Malayan Breweries & Heineken interests

Background

The story began in 1985 when Chris Mace and Peter Cooper backdoor-listed Mace Development Corporation through Woolworths (NZ) Properties. LD Nathan held 20% of Mace Development.

Mace and Cooper had more humble backgrounds than many of the prominent businessmen associated with Lion and LD Nathan. Mace started as a carpenter and Cooper was born in Kaitaia and attended Kaitaia College.

The two young men met at Muriwai Beach where Mace was a lifeguard and Cooper a surfer.

Cooper obtained a law degree and became a partner at Russell McVeagh before branching out to form Mace Development with Mace. Geoff Ricketts and Robin Congreve two other Russell McVeagh partners also joined the Mace Development board.

In 1986 LD Nathan acquired 100% of Mace Development and Congreve Mace and Cooper were all appointed directors of the purchaser. They joined Ricketts who had been an LD Nathan director since 1981.

Ricketts and Congreve were also directors of Capital Markets which was Fay Richwhite’s NZX-listed vehicle at the time.

Lion & LD Nathan

In Sept 1987 Doug Myers the managing director and major shareholder of Lion Corporation announced he would purchase 30% of LD Nathan from Mace and Cooper through his private company Campbell and Ehrenfried.

However the proposed transaction fell through after the Oct 1987 sharemarket crash.

Fay Richwhite which owned 35% of LD Nathan wanted out and Myers was concerned that the Malayan Breweries/Heineken interests which had increased their Lion stake to 22% would purchase this 35% holding and gain control of his company.

Fay Richwhite threatened to sell to another party but in Feb 1988 Lion and LD Nathan announced a merger whereby Fay Richwhite would receive $9.20 cash for each of its LD Nathan shares – worth $351 million – and the remaining LD Nathan shareholders would receive one Lion share for every share in the target company.

LD Nathan chairman Keith Coe wrote: “This price represents a significant premium above the present sharemarket price for Nathan’s shares. However Fay Richwhite is only prepared to sell its holding on a cash basis and consequently Lion has no alternative but to purchase Fay Richwhite’s shares if the merger is to proceed.”

There was no takeovers code at the time although the NZX had an equal-price rule for acquisitions.

A 57-page submission by Lion to the Securities Commission ridiculed the stock exchange’s equal-pricing code. The submission noted this requirement had been “little more than an inconvenience” and had been “essentially voluntary” and asserted it had been “a relatively simple task to avoid the operation of the code”.

Ironically the Lion submission argued that household participation in the NZX which didn’t have a robust equal-pricing regime was as high as 30% while household participation in the United States markets which had stronger equal-pricing requirements was only half this figure.

In other words Lion argued that New Zealand investors liked the wild west characteristics of their domestic market while US investors were relatively less interested in their regulated stock exchanges.

True to form the NZX didn’t enforce its requirement that all shareholders should be treated equally in a merger or takeover.

Conflict

Malayan Breweries was furious with the proposed Lion/LD Nathan merger as it would seriously dilute its shareholding.

Michael Fam who represented the Asian/Dutch brewing interests on the Lion board went on the front foot and attempted to obtain discovery of documents in relation to the Fay Richwhite deal but his application was rejected by the High Court.

The Securities Commission found no evidence of improper conflict and the NZX was unwilling to enforce its equal-pricing requirements.

Lion Corporation held an extraordinary meeting on March 8 1988 to approve the deal. Lion shareholders were required to support it even though the dual-pricing mechanism had an impact on LD Nathan rather than Lion shareholders.

Post offer

LD Nathan delisted on May 24 1988 but it was March 2006 – nearly 18 years after the merger – before Lion Nathan’s share price reached $9.20 the price Fay Richwhite received when it sold its LD Nathan stake to Lion.

The merger was a watershed event for several other reasons including:

It coincided with the demise of Equiticorp and Chase Corporation and demonstrated that a new business group was coming to the fore led by Myers Gibbs Michael Fay David Richwhite Rickett and Congreve.

This group played a leading role in the Business Roundtable which continued to lobby aggressively against sharemarket regulation particularly an effective takeovers code.

The merger also signalled that the NZX – in one of its first big tests after the Oct 1987 crash – continued to be far more sympathetic towards big-business interests rather than individual investors.

The Securities Commission first proposed a takeovers code in 1983 but none was introduced until mid-2001 because of massive opposition from the Business Roundtable big-business interests and the NZX.

It is 33 years since the Lion/LD Nathan controversy and most of the participants have either died or retired.

However Ricketts is chairman of NZX-listed Heartland Group and Cooper has played a major role in the redevelopment of Auckland’s Britomart after making a fortune in the US.

But there haven’t been any recent sightings of Cooper and Mace surfing together at Muriwai Beach.

When Tesla initially dropped the price of solar roof V3 they went too low to get bites. The average wait time for a solar roof installation in the SF Bay Area is 6 months so you can guess they have more orders than they can handle. With the price increase they may include common pre-construction costs which a lot of people were complaining things like permitting new roof vents and possibly roof decking or partial repair of decking. I think most of these were included in the early days then Tesla started charging people for them because Tesla may not even break even with everything inclusive and people cried foul. So if you can get panels instead that would be a better option solar roof is a premium product but I think was priced so low that Tesla was not making much money on it. May be in another year or two when they are caught up with installation they will lower the price again.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vdGVzbGEtYXV0b3BpbG90LWZzZC1jYW1lcmEtYXBwcm9hY2gtZXhwbGFpbmVkLWVsb24tbXVzay_SAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZXNsYXJhdGkuY29tL3Rlc2xhLWF1dG9waWxvdC1mc2QtY2FtZXJhLWFwcHJvYWNoLWV4cGxhaW5lZC1lbG9uLW11c2svYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk explains Tesla’s pure vision approach to Autopilot and Full Self-Driving,"By

A recent set of updates from Elon Musk has revealed that Tesla is looking to eventually update its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving suite to a camera-based system. This means that in the future Tesla’s all-electric vehicles would be navigating themselves and performing driver-assist functions without the use of components such as radar.

Musk’s update came as a response to a post from Tesla owner and FSD Beta user @WholeMarsBlog who shared a clip of his Model 3 navigating away from a parking lot to its destination without input from its driver. In his response Musk noted that FSD Beta V9.0 which has been highly-anticipated by the EV community is almost ready.

Almost ready with FSD Beta V9.0. Step change improvement is massive especially for weird corner cases & bad weather. Pure vision no radar. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 9 2021

Elaborating further Musk explained that the V9.0 update should improve the FSD Beta’s performance in corner cases and bad weather which remain challenging to the advanced driver-assist system today. But this was not all as Musk noted that the update would be “pure vision no radar.” When prodded further the Tesla CEO admitted that Tesla eventually plans to get rid of radar altogether in its future vehicles.

Unsurprisingly Musk’s statements about Tesla’s impending removal of radar attracted its own fair share of critics many of whom argued that a pure vision approach is a step backward. This is especially notable as Tesla is already using fewer sensors for its driver-assist systems compared to competitors like Cruise and Waymo both of whom rely on lidar and high-definition maps to navigate.

Musk responded to these concerns highlighting that ultimately vision has the potential to be far superior to radar.

Sensors are a bitstream and cameras have several orders of magnitude more bits/sec than radar (or lidar). Radar must meaningfully increase signal/noise of bitstream to be worth complexity of integrating it. As vision processing gets better it just leaves radar far behind. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 10 2021

“When radar and vision disagree which one do you believe? Vision has much more precision so better to double down on vision than do sensor fusion. Sensors are a bitstream and cameras have several orders of magnitude more bits/sec than radar (or lidar). Radar must meaningfully increase signal/noise of bitstream to be worth complexity of integrating it. As vision processing gets better it just leaves radar far behind” Musk explained.

Tesla’s approach to full self-driving is partly based on the notion that humans do 100% of their driving through vision alone without any radar or lidar use. This was highlighted by Tesla executives since Autonomy Day back in 2019 when the company unveiled its custom FSD computer. As for concerns about whether cameras could provide the same level of safety as radar in detecting what is happening several cars ahead Musk noted that there’s a high probability that vision could perform just as well.

These things are best thought of as probabilities. There are 5 forward-facing cameras. It is highly likely that at least one of them will see multiple cars ahead. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 10 2021

“These things are best thought of as probabilities. There are 5 forward-facing cameras. It is highly likely that at least one of them will see multiple cars ahead” Musk said.

Tesla is not the only company in the market that is looking into a vision-only approach. Last year Intel Corp released a video of an autonomous car from MobilEye that was navigating around Jerusalem for about 20 minutes. Unlike other self-driving vehicles MobilEye’s car was only equipped with a suite of cameras and nothing else. The brief video was impressive showing the MobilEye autonomous car going through four-way intersections with no traffic lights as well as inner-city lanes that required the vehicle to avoid pedestrians.

In the past this version was hidden but now it’s being advertised on Tesla’s Canadian order website.

There is a good reason for Tesla to offer this low-range model: customer tax incentives. Canada’s government created a $5000 tax incentive for the purchase of a new EV in 2019 but the base price must be under $45000 and cost no more than $55000 with options. All Teslas didn’t qualify because all models started over $45000 at the time.

So Tesla dropped the price to $44999 in order to qualify and calls it the Model 3 Standard Range. The order website has $46389 as the price but that includes destination air conditioning and OMVIC fees.

To get the price down Tesla software-locked the battery pack to 94 miles (151 km) and removed Autopilot. But you can still add Autopilot for $4000 and full-self driving capability (FSD) for $10600.

Tesla claims that the short-range Standard Range has the same 0-60 mph time of 5.6 seconds as the Standard Range Plus model that has a driving range of 263 miles (423 km). The top speed of 140 mph (225 kph) is also the same between the two models.

Very few Canadian customers have opted for the Standard Range because it wasn’t advertised and only those who knew about it ordered it. Now that it’s advertised I’m curious how many more will sell.

94 miles isn't much range but many don’t need that much range and can live without Autopilot if it allows them to afford a new Model 3 after the tax incentive.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vbmV3cy90ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC0zLXByaWNpbmctanVzdC1jaGFuZ2VkLWFnYWluLXdoYXQteW91LW5lZWQtdG8ta25vd9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Model 3 pricing just changed again — what you need to know,"Tesla can’t seem to make its mind up about just how much the Model 3 should cost. As spotted by Electrek the company has added an extra $500 to the cost of its electric Sedan meaning prices for the Model 3 Standard Range Plus now start at $38490 not including the $1200 destination charge.

The price change coincides with a minor design change to the interior as there is now a wooden door trim as shown below.

The $500 price increase also impacts the dual motor Long Range AWD which jumps from $46990 to $47490. In addition to offering a longer estimated travel range (353 miles up from 263) it has a 5 mph higher top speed and can do 0-60 mph in just 4.2 seconds – 1.1 seconds faster than the Standard Range Plus.

(Image credit: Tesla)

The top-of-the-line Performance model of the Tesla Model 3 gets an even bigger price increase jumping by $1000 from $55990 to $56990. You get a higher 162 mph top speed and a 0-60 mph time of 3.1 seconds. Plus the Performance model justifies the higher cost of entry with its 20-inch Überturbine wheels performance brakes a carbon fiber spoiler aluminum alloy pedals and lowered suspension.

All of these prices go even higher if you want anything but the default white coat of paint too. Buyers can expect to pay an extra $1000 for Solid Black Midnight Silver Metallic or Deep Blue Metallic or an extra $2000 for a Red Multi-Coat. An optional black-and-white interior adds another $1000 to the bill and if you want access to the Full Self-Driving beta with Tesla’s Level 2 driver-assist tech you’re looking at a further $10000.

It’s not just the Tesla Model 3 that sees price adjustments in this shake up. The Tesla Model Y Long Range AWD sees a $500 jump from $49990 to $50490 though the Performance version remains static at $60990. There’s still no sign of the entry-level standard range model on the site so it’s unclear if the original $39000 price plan remains in place.

Tesla has made no comment as to why the prices keep shifting but it likely has something to do with the worldwide shortage of semiconductor chips which are impacting everything from PS5 stock to the likes of GM Ford and Honda’s production lines. That would also go some way to explaining the delivery time on all vehicles which now stretches to an agonizing 8-12-weeks for the Model S or 6-10 week for the Model Y.

Police said it happened around 4 a.m. on Miramar Parkway near Southwest 65th Avenue.

Home surveillance cameras captured the moment the Tesla started on the destructive path.

Neighbors said one person was inside the car and was unconscious after the crash. That driver was rushed to Memorial Regional Hospital by first responders.

The driver remains in critical condition and the cause of the crash remains under investigation.

(See crash from nearby doorbell camera.)

An area resident said Miramar police on scene told him the driver was possibly going over 100 mph.

The impact of the car was so rough that it lifted a pick-up truck parked in front of the home and crashed a Mazda also parked.

Neighbors who saw the car speed by on their ring camera described it as looking like “a flash of light.”

The people who live inside the home that was hit told Local 10 News that they are not allowed back into the house because of possible structural damage. Officials will determine if and when the house is safe."

Across various publications experts and reports a recurring critical theme is the state of the middle class in America and its struggles in an increasingly expensive and transforming society. Indeed in much of the country the middle class is facing a bleak financial future. Fortunately that isn’t the whole story. There are some cities where the middle class is thriving.

In order to find out where GOBankingRates conducted a study analyzing the 200 largest U.S. cities in terms of the growth in middle-class incomes households and businesses and industries employing them. But what is considered “middle class”? Middle class is ultimately based on income with educational achievement and status being secondary factors. According to Pew Research middle-class incomes are those that are two-thirds to double the national median. This is crucial because it demonstrates how being middle class actually shifts from place to place.

For example Miami’s median household income is $33999 making its middle-class income range $22666 to $67998. But in San Francisco the median household income is $96265 making its middle-class income range $64177 to $192530. But despite these differences you can still find places where America’s middle class is thriving.

The move accelerates the pace of deal-making by OpenGate following 2020’s pandemic-induced slowdown.



Kongsberg a provider of digital cutting systems and hardware solutions for the packaging and related sectors was established in 1965. The company has 400 employees with operations in Belgium the Czech Republic and Norway.

Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.



OpenGate managed more than $1 billion in assets as of the end of 2020.



“With the heightened focus on digitization in the industrial sector Kongsberg is well-positioned to develop new operational efficiencies and innovative solutions to drive organic growth” Andrew Nikou OpenGate’s founder and chief executive said in a statement.



OpenGate which also has an office in Paris invests in companies that generate up to $1 billion in revenue annually. The acquisition highlights OpenGate’s long history of investing in Europe as well as its focus within the industrial sector.



Kongsberg is the eighth investment and fifth corporate carve-out in OpenGate’s second institutional fund OpenGate Capital Partners II & II-A LP.



OpenGate closed the fund in November 2019 at approximately $585 million which was 30% higher than the firm’s initial target of $450 million.



OpenGate has made more than 30 acquisitions since its founding in 2005 and has seen a steady uptick in its portfolio activity this year.



Last month OpenGate sold the first of two divisions of portfolio company SMAC a global manufacturer of waterproofing and building envelopes based in France that OpenGate acquired just over two years ago.



In one sale OpenGate sold SMAC’s Axter unit which makes waterproofing membranes to shingle manufacturer IKO Industries Ltd. of Canada. OpenGate also plans to sell SMAC divisions Skydome and Essemes Services which it had hoped to divest in March.



SMAC was acquired by OpenGate from Paris-based Colas in February 2019.



Also last month OpenGate agreed to buy the ScioTeq and Treality Simulation Visual Systems divisions from TransDigm Group Inc. in Cleveland. ScioTeq and Treality manufacture “visualization solutions” for military and air traffic control markets.



In March OpenGate portfolio company Duraco Specialty Tapes purchased Illinois-based Filmquest Group from a private seller. Filmquest makes polyester and specialty films.",,,,,,,,,,,,

First up: a visit to Maryland to see family they haven't seen since Christmas 2019.

Ticket prices to Washington D.C. for the late April trip were reasonable but the 29-year-old California woman did a double take when she shopped for a rental car.

Costco Travel her go-to source for rental car deals wanted $750 for a three-day full-size car rental in Washington D.C. more than four times the price she usually pays for a weekend rental in the district.

""It was just ridiculous'' she said.

Ball who works in software sales checked the tourism calendar to see if the National Cherry Blossom Festival or another big event was going on. Nothing.

Searches for the other trips also turned up similarly eye-popping prices compared with previous years. In Newark New Jersey she's paying $691 for a weekly rental of a full-size car in early August. Before the pandemic they paid just $267 for a luxury car rental for five days for the Cape May beach getaway.

""We normally are more concerned about flight prices than we are for rental car prices'' she said. ""Now it's just the opposite.''

Why are car rentals so expensive?

Car renters be warned: surging demand and a shrunken supply of cars equals bad economics as summer travel season looms.

The coronavirus pandemic devastated the travel industry and car rental companies responded by shedding cars in their fleets just as airlines did with planes. Rental giant Hertz which also owns the Dollar and Thrifty brands was forced to file for bankruptcy reorganization in May and quickly started selling thousands of used cars in its fleet.

Pile up in Phoenix: Car rentals stack up at Sky Harbor Airport

Hertz and Enterprise Holdings which owns the Enterprise National and Alamo brands say they are working closely with automakers to add cars to their fleets as quickly as possible a process complicated by a microchip shortage that has temporarily closed some auto factories.

The companies and their competitors concede availability is an issue and will continue to be in the summer as travel rebounds. They are moving cars to areas with high demand spokespeople for both companies told USA TODAY.

Travelers in several vacation destinations including Hawaii; Las Vegas; Phoenix; and Orlando Florida have reported recent problems with availability prices and long airport check-in lines to pick up the car. AutoSlash a car rental search site that applies discount codes coupons and other promotions to help travelers save money said 18 of 20 airports in Florida were sold out of cars during many spring break weekends.

""The problem seems to be getting worse not better'' said AutoSlash founder Jonathan Weinberg.

And it's sure to spread beyond spring break destinations as a rush of newly vaccinated Americans resume travel many emboldened by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's recent announcement that travel poses a low risk to them.

""It's going to happen all at once. It's going to be everywhere'' Weinberg said.

Need a rental car? Book early

Car rentals are often an afterthought for travelers – something to do after booking airline tickets and hotels or vacation rentals.

Dawdling will likely backfire this year.

""If you do that you’re doing it at your peril'' Weinberg said. ""You're going to pay much more.''

And those who are traveling with several people and need a minivan or large SUV in high demand in pre-pandemic times may be shut out.

Hertz recommends travelers book their car when making other travel arrangements this year spokeswoman Lauren Luster said.

Weinberg booked a midsize car in January for his family's May vacation in Bozeman Montana. The price: $30 a day including taxes and fees. The price today: $62 a day.

There is no risk to booking early because car rental companies don't require a credit card or deposit to hold the reservation unless you book a nonrefundable prepaid rate to save money. (Weinberg is not a fan of the prepaid rates for most car rentals unless it's a last-minute trip because prices change frequently and you might lock in a higher-than-necessary price. The service monitors price changes and adjusts reservations when prices drop.)

Tips for saving money on rental cars during the pandemic

►Gather every discount you can find. AAA AARP Costco and Sam's Club other membership organizations and credit card companies are among those offering car rental discounts. Check your employer too as corporate travel discounts might extend to employee vacations. Enter the discount codes on car rental booking sites or use a free service like AutoSlash to shop for deals. (Ball read about AutoSlash which hunts for rental car discounts using applicable coupon codes and other promotions and used it to get her Washington D.C. April rental down to $336 from Costco's original $750 estimate.)

►Try different travel dates if you're plans aren't set. ""Providing flexible travel dates in their search may also help as it often does with airline flights'' Enterprise spokeswoman Lisa Martini said.

►Shorten the length of your reservation – without shortening your vacation. For a trip to Boston and Maine over Memorial Day Costco quoted Ball $800 for a six-day rental. They decided to stay at an airport hotel on the first and last night of the trip to save money. That initially only cut the price to $700 so they kept shopping for four-day rentals and eventually nabbed one for $393 for an SUV.

►Book the car for longer than you need it. Car rental companies would rather rent for a week than a weekend Weinberg said so will often show no availability or higher prices for shorter rentals. His company extends the trip beyond the date the car is needed and has customers return it early. Most of the time they receive a refund for the unused days. ""It's a nice little trick that we've learned'' he said.

►Consider an off-airport location. Airport rentals are more convenient but demand is strongest there and many airports have sky-high taxes that spike the bill. Expedia said renting a car at a off-airport location in downtown Seattle was running 50% cheaper per day than a comparable car at the Seattle airport earlier this week.

Factor in the price of transportation to the off-airport location and be sure to check their hours before booking. Many are only open during traditional business hours which rules out rentals for most evening flights.

One option to check: pick up at an off-airport location and drop off at the airport if allowed to avoid airport taxes.

►Compare a la carte prices and vacation packages. Travel agencies and airlines sell vacation packages that include a car rental so do the math to see which is the better deal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZG91Z2dvbGxhbi8yMDIxLzA0LzEwL3RoZXNlLXByaXZhdGUtamV0LWNvbXBhbmllcy1hcmUtZ29pbmctdnRvbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Major Private Jet Companies Are Going VTOL,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/douggollan/2021/04/10/these-private-jet-companies-are-going-vtol/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZG91Z2dvbGxhbi8yMDIxLzA0LzEwL3RoZXNlLXByaXZhdGUtamV0LWNvbXBhbmllcy1hcmUtZ29pbmctdnRvbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMTEvY3J5c3RhbC1jYWJpbi1hd2FyZHMtZnV0dXJlLW9mLXJlZGVzaWduZWQtYWlycGxhbmUtY2FiaW5zLmh0bWzSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMS8wNC8xMS9jcnlzdGFsLWNhYmluLWF3YXJkcy1mdXR1cmUtb2YtcmVkZXNpZ25lZC1haXJwbGFuZS1jYWJpbnMuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From 'coffeehouse style' seating to a more comfortable economy class take a look at redesigned airplane cabins,"For better or worse airline travel is on its way back.

There were no leftover banners. There were no protests. Only a handful of people wore gear with the game’s logo. And the only booing heard on Friday night — when the Braves played their first home game following M.L.B.’s decision to yank the Midsummer Classic out of Georgia because of a contentious new voting law — was for the visiting Philadelphia Phillies and their outfielder Bryce Harper.

The atmosphere around Truist Park felt almost prepandemic. Two hours before the first pitch the bars and restaurants in the surrounding streets swarmed with fans. The concession-stand lines during the Braves’ 8-1 win were long. The mandatory masks and social distancing appeared optional. The tomahawk chop a chant widely viewed as racist emerged at key junctures in the game.

As for a planned boycott of M.L.B. — as some conservative politicians and fans had threatened — “it doesn’t look like it does it?” said John Swindler as he and his soon-to-be-wife Teri both 48 surveyed the crowd outside the Braves’ publicly funded stadium.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy4xMWFsaXZlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Nwb3J0cy9tbGIvYXRsYW50YS1icmF2ZXMvZnJlZGRpZS1mcmVlbWFuLXN1cnByaXNlcy1waGlsbGllcy1mYW4vODUtNjE4OGViYjEtMDI0OS00NWFjLThkZDItMmViMDBhYjE5N2E40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Freddie Freeman Bryce Harper surprise young Phillies fan,"The young fan was seen giving away a home run ball to another boy in a Freeman jersey.

ATLANTA — A home run ball is a treasure for any baseball fan - something many only dreams of catching. So it was a surprise for those watching the game on television and the commentators when a young Phillies fan gave it up.

Video recorded of that special moment shows the moment during the bottom of the ninth when according to NBC Philadelphia the young Phillies fan came just inches from catching Freddie Freeman's two-run home run. The ball fell into the bullpen but the fan ultimately got his hands on the ball.

That would be a pretty cool moment in itself. But what made this night at Truist Park truly amazing was what happened next. The video shows when this father and son give up the ball - to a young Brave's fan in a Freddie Freeman jersey.

The moment of kindness has sparked a bit of happiness on Twitter and caught the eyes of networks across the country.

Freddie Freeman hit a home run for the Brave’s and a father and son in Phillies gear retrieved it.



Then the son turned right around around and gave the ball to a young Brave’s fan.

It also captured the eye of the guy who hit the home run to begin with. A video shared by the Braves on Sunday shows the two Phillies fans once again in stands when up walks Freeman himself.

Freeman spoke to the young man and shook his hand saying that he saw the video of that moment. He then gave the stunned young fan a ball autographed by Phillies Rightfielder Bryce Harper and himself.

The Phillies meanwhile are planning to send a few more items to this father and son in honor of the now-viral moment showing true class.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2J0di5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9mcmVkZGllLWZyZWVtYW4tc3VycHJpc2VzLXlvdW5nLXBoaWxsaWVzLWZhbi13aG8tZ2F2ZS1oci1iYWxsLXlvdW5nLWJyYXZlcy1mYW4vQVRVTUxUUFhFRkg3M0RBQlpHWkJBT09DRkEv0gGaAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndzYnR2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2ZyZWRkaWUtZnJlZW1hbi1zdXJwcmlzZXMteW91bmctcGhpbGxpZXMtZmFuLXdoby1nYXZlLWhyLWJhbGwteW91bmctYnJhdmVzLWZhbi9BVFVNTFRQWEVGSDczREFCWkdaQkFPT0NGQS8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Freddie Freeman surprises young Phillies fan who gave HR ball to young Braves fan,"We’re Sorry!

ATLANTA Georgia (WPVI) -- A young Phillies fan got quite a surprise on Sunday after a viral moment involving a home run ball during a game against the Atlanta Braves.

On Friday night's Phillies-Braves game first baseman Freddie Freeman crushed a ball into the outfield at Truist Park right into the hands of Joshua a young Phillies fan. But he couldn't hold onto it.

Then Joshua got a second chance when a player threw him back the ball but that didn't work out so well either. The moment gave Joshua's dad quite a giggle.

But Joshua decided not to keep the ball after all. He instead walked over and gave it to a young Braves fan wearing a Freeman jersey.

Before Sunday night's game the Phillies along with the Braves surprised Joshua and his father James Scott with a baseball signed by Bryce Harper and Freddie Freeman.

""Joshua demonstrated what it means to be a great baseball fan on Friday night"" the Phillies posted on Twitter.

Video tweeted by the Braves shows the heartwarming moment Freeman met the father and son.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL2dvbGYvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zMTIzMDQxOS9wcm90ZXN0LW1hc3RlcnMtcHVzaGVzLWJhY2stZ2VvcmdpYS12b3RpbmctbGF3LWdvdi1icmlhbi1rZW1wLWtlZXBzLWF0dGFjay1tbGLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Protest near Masters pushes back against Georgia voting law; Gov. Brian Kemp keeps up attack on MLB,"Opinions about the controversial new Georgia voting law could be found across the state Saturday as a small group of protesters spoke out about the measure near Augusta National while the governor continued to lambaste Major League Baseball for its decision to move the All-Star Game out of Atlanta.

About two dozen protesters turned out near Augusta National to object to the voting law during the third round of the Masters. The group held signs that said ""Let Us Vote"" and ""Protect Georgia Voting Rights"" drawing both jeers and cheers from motorists on busy Washington Road.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp meanwhile spoke at a restaurant miles from Truist Park where the 2021 MLB All-Star Game had been slated to be played before it was moved to Denver's Coors Field earlier this month.

In his remarks Kemp stepped up his attack on MLB saying the move politicized the sport and would hurt minority-owned businesses in the area.

""It's minority-owned businesses that have been hit harder than most because of an invisible virus by no fault of their own"" Kemp said. ""And these are the same minority businesses that are now being impacted by another decision that is by no fault of their own.""

MLB commissioner Rob Manfred has said he made the decision to move the All-Star events after discussions with individual players and The Players Alliance an organization of Black players formed after the death of George Floyd last year and that the league opposed restrictions to the ballot box.

An MLB spokesman said the league had no immediate additional comment Saturday.

Kemp spoke along with Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr also a Republican at a seafood and po'boy restaurant though he said he didn't think the business was minority-owned. Kemp also noted that Denver has a much smaller percentage of African Americans than Atlanta.

Georgia's new voting law had also led to calls for the Masters to be taken out of Augusta National but club chairman Fred Ridley said before the major began that he was against such a boycott.

The law -- which opponents say is designed to reduce the impact of minority voters by making it more difficult to cast a ballot -- has drawn fire from around the country. Among other things the law imposes additional identification requirements for absentee voting gives the GOP-run state elections board new powers to intervene in local election offices and restricts the distribution of water and food to voters standing in long lines.

The state played a critical role in the 2020 election narrowly going for Joe Biden in the presidential race before Georgia's two incumbent Republican senators were defeated in a runoff by Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff giving Democrats control of the U.S. Senate.

Former President Donald Trump made repeated baseless claims of fraud after his presidential loss to Biden. Democrats have assailed the law as an attempt to suppress Black and Latino votes with Biden calling it ""Jim Crow in the 21st century.""

In Augusta the protesters received a mixed reaction. One man passing by shouted an insult against Kemp but another yelled at protesters ""C'mon you can vote! Get out of here!""

""This bill is death by a thousand cuts"" said one of the protesters Marla Cureton who is part of a women's activist group known as No Safe Seats. ""Anytime you put new restrictions on how you can vote that's voter suppression. We should be making it easier to vote. It's the patriotic thing to do.""

Gov. Bill Lee Senator Bill Hagerty U.S. Representative David Kustoff and Humboldt Mayor Marvin Sikes spoke to the gathering of about 700 including employees already working at the plant and invited guests.

Tyson executives Donnie King COO and group president - poultry and John R. Tyson chief sustainability officer and member of the Tyson family also spoke at the event.

But it was Tom McCue the complex manager for the plant in Humboldt who got the largest ovation from the crowd when he was introduced to speak.

Tyson Foods in Humboldt has already hired about 400 of its planned 1500 employees who’ve helped in preparation for the beginning of operations which is set to begin later this month.

McCue said he’s already begun trying to build a family dynamic for the crew from the outset.

“I’ve been with Tyson for 27 years and it is like a family” McCue said. “I look at our team members today and we’re already a family here in Humboldt and a part of the Tyson family.”

The process to the ribbon cutting began in earnest on Nov. 20 2017 when the announcement was made that Tyson Foods was coming to Humboldt in front of a packed conference room at Humboldt Hospital.

In the three-and-a-half years since then the city of Humboldt has had a couple of new roads paved leading to the new facility which is the first tenant in the new Gibson County Industrial Park.

McCue said the plant is set to begin shipping products in the final week of April as it begins the work of increasing to full capacity which is expected to be a two-year process.

“This is emotional for me because we’ve been here for three-and-a-half years since the first announcement” McCue said. “I’m just so happy for the folks that we’ve hired and the ones we’ll hire in the future.”

All of the elected officials touted the economic impact of Tyson coming to Humboldt on the local and surrounding economy.

“This won’t just impact the lives of 1500 people it will impact the lives of 1500 families” Hagerty said.

Lee said he’s glad Tyson chose to invest even more into the state of Tennessee as there are already multiple Tyson facilities in different parts of the state including Goodlettsville Shelbyville and Union City. But he also appreciates this is another step for agriculture to boost Tennessee’s economy.

“Agriculture is the largest industry in the state and this facility is giving 1500 people a chance to be a part of that while helping farmers in the surrounding area” Lee said.

John R. Tyson is a fourth-generation leader of the company his great-grandfather started in Arkansas and he said he’s glad to see the facility open where it did.

“We are incredibly proud to make western Tennessee the home of our first new poultry facility in 25 years and look forward to being part of the community and supporting the local economy” Tyson said.

The US-based Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility which comprises 300 organisations that see their investments in businesses as “a catalyst for social change” yesterday (24 August) announced the filing of five shareholder resolutions for Tyson’s 2017 proxy ballot.

The ICCR said the move reflected Tyson’s “poor performance on environmental social and governance (ESG) issues”. It claimed its members believe the response from Tyson’s management on the issues has been “poor”.

Nadira Narine programme director at the ICCR said: “The risks presented in these resolutions are significant and impact a broad group of stakeholders. Shareholders want the companies they invest in to use their influence to minimise environmental and social risk and to have adequate corporate governance mechanisms in place. Our members continue to call on Tyson to authentically engage its shareholders and other stakeholders to proactively address these important issues.”

On water the ICCR has urged Tyson to put in place a new “water stewardship policy” to reduce the risks of water contamination at the company’s own plants facilities under contract to Tyson and the company’s suppliers. It pointed to a report by lobby group Environment America which claimed Tyson discharged over 20 million pounds of permitted toxic pollutants to waterways in 2014.

On animal welfare a resolution put forward by the Humane Society of the United States asks Tyson to “disclose the risks endangering the company and investors from emerging animal welfare issues” and the steps the company has in place to address them.

Green Century Capital Management a group of what claims to be environmentally-responsible mutual funds has issued a resolution seeks to find out what steps Tyson will take “to address risks to the business from the increased prevalence of plant-based eating”.

Marissa LaFave a shareholder advocate at Green Century said: “The demand for plant-based proteins is skyrocketing and needs to be considered and accounted for in business planning. Failure to see around corners and adjust to changing demands places the company at a great disadvantage relative to its competitors in the food industry who are already innovating in this area.”

The other two of the five resolutions focus on board diversity and lobbying disclosure. Oxfam campaigner Oliver Gottfried said: “Given that nearly two-thirds of Tyson’s workforce is comprised of people of color yet only one person of color sits on their board we believe the company needs to do a better job of more intentionally promoting diversity.”

Tyson had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. The company’s shareholders meeting is likely to take place in early 2017.

In March Tyson released a wide-ranging sustainability report in which for example the company outlined its “commitment to animal well-being”. It also said it would start reporting its “water management and performance efforts” to environment NGO the the CDP in 2016.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxL2Fwci8xMS9oZWFydHMtYmVhdC10b2dldGhlci1mb3Itb25lLWRheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hearts beat together for one day,"Backers of Paint the Town Red the Heart Ball and Go Red for Women will have the opportunity to experience a little of all three signature events on May 21 when the Northwest Arkansas area of the American Heart Association plays host to the Heart of Northwest Arkansas.

But railroad officials won’t let the new crossing open until the city buys a $10 million insurance policy protecting the railroad’s liability at the intersection city officials say.

The longer the Maple and Meadow crossings remain closed the more traffic is diverted to the Caudle Avenue crossing a few blocks south of the crossing.

The Caudle crossing offers nothing in the way of safety mechanisms except for a stop sign. The Maple Street crossing sports lights and gates to make everyone safer said Ernest Cate city attorney.

“It’s ironic it’s closed because now Maple is the safest crossing in the city” said Mayor Doug Sprouse.

City and railroad officials have been negotiating since the fall and will meet again Monday Sprouse said. The city wants to renegotiate an agreement it signed with the railroad in August which included a $25 million policy and other conditions.

“At that time we asked them to concentrate on the Maple project immediately before us so we could get that crossing going” he said.

The city couldn’t find an insurance carrier to cover a $25 million policy Cate said.

“I think the money would be better spent by upgrading other crossings rather than sitting in an insurance policy” Sprouse said. “We think there’s a better solution for the city the railroad and the residents.”

The railroad March 29 proposed a $10 million insurance policy and the closing of the Caudle Avenue crossing to which the city has agreed Cate said. But nothing has been set in stone he cautioned.

The Arkansas & Missouri is a short-line railroad running 150 miles from Monett Mo. to Fort Smith. The railroad has recorded 14 accidents at railroad crossings since 2016 resulting in three injuries and no deaths according to the Federal Railroad Administration.

The railroad serves many of the city’s industrial companies Sprouse said. Those industries also make the city important to the railroad he said.

Railroad officials and the company’s attorney Joel Johnson of Hayes Johnson and Conley law firm in Fort Smith declined to comment on the negotiations.

NEGOTIATION

Sprouse said the railroad asked to close a street crossing at East Meadow Avenue saying it was dangerous. The city closed the street in March 2018. The crossing sat just south of the railroad’s depot for the excursion train which operated on several tracks crossing Meadow. The depot’s buildings and passenger cars blocked motorists’ views of the tracks Sprouse said.

Tyson Foods had just opened its Emma Avenue complex for information technology employees adding more cars to the area he said.

The city agreed to closing Meadow with an understanding a new crossing could be built at Maple Sprouse continued. The Maple crossing is a few blocks south of the Meadow crossing.

City officials thought they had a “gentlemen’s agreement” with the railroad to open a new railroad crossing at Maple.

But the railroad’s owner died and management changed. The new management wouldn’t honor the agreement Cate said.

The agreement Sprouse signed in August also asked for an annual $13000 maintenance fee from the city and fencing around the crossing.

The city also closed Hewitt Street to the east of the railroad’s shop building at the request of the railroad Sprouse said.

He noted the railroad also initially agreed to pay the construction cost of building the Maple Street crossing.

Cate said he feels both sides are close to a new agreement.

The city suggested adding the liability protection to the railroad’s current liability policy with the city paying the extra premium Cate said. The city carries no liability insurance because Arkansas law protects local governments and their officers from most liability lawsuits.

POLICY DENIED

An email in August to Cate provided the city a list of 14 insurance brokers that said no when Farris Insurance Agency acting on behalf of the city contacted them for a railroad protective liability policy.

One of the companies Saville Public Entity of Nor-cross Ga. denied insurance according to records provided by Cate. The company said it had seen liability insurance for railroads only on construction projects and those policies were never that high.

“The agreement is very simple compared to others we have seen and unreasonable” a company official wrote referring to the amount of coverage. Saville specializes in insurance for local governments.

Johnson attorney for the railroad replied all other cities along the railroad complied with its requests.

Fayetteville also seeks a railroad liability insurance for two new crossings it plans. Chris Brown director of Public Works said the railroad agreed to $5 million in liability.

“It’s expensive but doable” he said.

The city hasn’t yet put such a policy in place he said. Fayetteville also will pay for the construction costs of the new crossings and close two current crossings.

“We’ll close one for each one we open” he said.

The amount of insurance required of other cities was lower because they agreed to close more than one crossing according to an email to Springdale officials from Johnson.

Fayetteville wants to add crossings on North Gregg Avenue immediately north and south of the Fulbright Expressway Brown said. These will open thoroughfares to North Garland Avenue.

Garland also holds the designation of Arkansas 112 and the state Department of Transportation has announced plans to improve that highway from Fayetteville to Bentonville.

The city will close the crossing at South University Avenue by the Walmart Neighborhood Market and Jocelyn Lane off North Gregg which serves just one home Brown said.

Fayetteville also will pay a yearly $7500 maintenance contract with the cost increasing with the Consumer Price Index Brown said.

Chugging down the line

The Arkansas & Missouri Railroad was established in 1986 as a Class III railroad running a 150-mile route from Monett Mo. to Fort Smith. A&M’s corporate headquarters is in Springdale with major operations based in Springdale and Fort Smith.

The railroad handles shipments of grain food packaging frozen poultry sand scrap steel and more.

The railroad also operates an excursion train that carries 40000 a year through the Boston Mountains between Springdale and Van Buren.

Irvines Tanzania Limited intends to produce 250000 broiler chicks per week when production commences soon according to managing director Pietro Stella.

“We will breed the best quality chicks for the day using the latest technology” he told journalists at the site recently.

US-based Tyson Foods is a partner in the Sh32 billion venture the fourth largest investment in broiler breeding in Africa by the American food giant.

The company is the world’s leading processor and marketer of chicken and beef among other foodstuffs for the export market.

Dr Stella added that when in full production the facility would satisfy domestic demand for chicken as well as for the export market.

Production is set to double to 500000 chicks a week or two million a month during the second phase of the project implementation.

Installation of structures for the breeding units at the company’s 500-acre Kiliwest farm are in the final stages.

Dr Stella said the company would go for Cobb 500 broiler breed chicks from the United States which according to him were resistant to drought and disease.

The Siha breeding centre for chicks which will employ about 100 workers will be complemented by a hatchery to be established at Kerege near Bagamoyo in July this year.

The hatchery has been established in Bagamoyo because of its proximity to Dar es Salaam the largest market for poultry products in the country.

The MD said poultry was now a profitable business after the government recently waived value-added tax (VAT) on chicken feed.

When fully implemented Tanzania will become the fourth country in Africa to mass produce Cobb 500 breed of chicken after Zimbabwe Botswana and Mozambique.

Mr Hussein Gonga one of the partners in the project said the scheme had high potential and was in line with the government’s industrialisation drive.

He lauded the government for creating a conducive environment which had attracted investors to the agricultural sector which he added would accelerate industrialisation.

Traditional poultry breeding accounts for 70 per cent of chicken production in Tanzania.

Tanzania recently banned the importation of chicks and chicken to avoid bird flu and to protect local industries and poultry farmers."

Simply sign up to the US financial regulation myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

Rules written in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis to limit the potential for a blow-up like Archegos Capital have still not been fully implemented throwing a spotlight on regulators in a fiasco that has shocked Wall Street and raised questions on Capitol Hill.

Crucial parts of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act an 848-page law that was meant to shore up big banks and temper excessive risk taking in the derivatives market have been delayed again and again.

Critics are now arguing that had regulators implemented the rules faster the implosion of Bill Hwang’s family office and the multibillion-dollar losses it caused two banks could have been limited.

In particular rules that would have governed the disclosure of Archegos’s derivatives trades are still not in force and neither are requirements for players like Hwang to post initial margin payments meant to cover potential trading losses. Hwang was able to place more than $50bn of bets on the share prices of a handful of US and Chinese companies and could not pay his counterparties when they started going against him.

Diane Jaffee a portfolio manager at asset manager TCW said that regulators had implemented Dodd-Frank at an “anaemic” pace. The ability of an unknown family office like Archegos to run up such outsize risks “is like the last hurrah . . . before regulations come in” she said.

What we try to do is make sure that the banks understand the risks that they're running and have systems in place to manage them. This would appear to be . . . a failure on that front

Equity total return swaps like those used by Archegos are overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission which has been far slower to write its rules than the Commodity Futures Trading Commission the main derivatives regulator.

SEC rules are due to finally come into force on November 1. Had they already done so the SEC would have had access to data on Archegos’s trades including the size of each transaction and who the family office had traded with — rules already established in other parts of the derivatives market regulated by the CFTC.

“It is a dereliction of duty by the SEC not to have a properly regulated swaps market 13 years after they were at the core of causing and spreading the 2008 crash” said Dennis Kelleher president of the advocacy group Better Markets.

The opacity of Archegos’s positions has proven central to the incident given many of its trading counterparties did not know it had taken similar positions with other banks across Wall Street. It was only when Hwang called Archegos’ many counterparties together for a meeting in late March that it became clear to each bank how large and concentrated the Archegos positions were people familiar with the meeting have said.

“The SEC is 10 years late on implementing rules that would have provided more transparency into what was happening” said an executive focused on government regulation at a large hedge fund. “The SEC completely dropped the ball.”

The SEC declined to comment.

Margin requirements were delayed

The SEC has also not implemented rules on margin requirements for derivatives trades conducted away from exchanges and clearing houses which would affect the broker dealers it regulates.

Broad global rules demanding that asset managers set aside more cash to cover their swaps deals are defined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and International Organization of Securities Commissions (Iosco) the umbrella group for global markets watchdogs. Local regulators are given some leeway to adapt the rules to their markets.

In the US that job is split among a host of regulators. Federal banking regulators have already introduced margin requirements for large banks trading with each other. However as Covid-19 struck last year global regulators agreed to push back the implementation of the rules that covered smaller financial firms trading derivatives from September 2020 to September 2022.

That decision meant a group like Archegos — which held derivatives positions worth more than $50bn according to people familiar with the trades — was not required by any US regulators to post margin when it first initiated a trade.

Had the delay not been agreed Archegos would have likely tripped above the designated size threshold last September requiring it to post margin by Basel and Iosco standards after the value of its notional derivatives exposure eclipsed $8bn. The rules would require enough cash to cover 10 days of possible losses based on the historic performance of the shares.

“The rules were designed to deal with these risks but they were designed on a schedule that ends up being too late to catch this counterparty” said a derivatives lawyer at a large international law firm.

Wider markets were insulated

Multiple derivatives lawyers noted that post-financial crisis capital rules had helped insulate wider markets with some of the banks involved absorbing sizeable losses without the need for state intervention.

Credit Suisse suffered a $4.7bn loss while Nomura has warned it could lose $2bn. Others including Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo collectively sold more than $20bn worth of stock they held as hedges for their trades with Archegos to limit their own losses. So far nine banks have found themselves involved in the tumult including Deutsche Bank UBS Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Mizuho.

The banks’ prime brokerage units that enabled Archegos’s supercharged trades have not disclosed how much margin they required when the fund first initiated its transactions. Lawyers who work with banks said they have not typically implemented regulatory minimums before they come into force because of competitive pressures.

Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell signalled concern telling the CBS news programme 60 Minutes on Sunday that he was concerned trades with a single customer could result in such substantial losses to these large firms.

“What we try to do is make sure that the banks understand the risks that they're running and have systems in place to manage them” he said. “This would appear to be a significant shortfall — a failure on that front.”

Credit Suisse Deutsche Bank Goldman MUFG Mizuho Morgan Stanley Nomura UBS and Wells Fargo declined to comment as did Archegos.

John Armstrong 32 was sentenced to prison by U.S. District Judge Wendy W. Berger for two 2019 bank robberies an attempted bank robbery a Hobbs Act robbery and three counts of brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence.

Armstrong plead guilty Sept. 22. Armstrong’s co-defendants Tanya Legg 45 North Fort Myers and Daniel Zirk 24 Spring Hill previously plead guilty and were sentenced in December 2020.

Armstrong was free on $125000 bail after an alleged August 2019 hit-and run crash that killed a woman on U.S. 41 when he committed two of the bank robberies police said.

The Aug. 30 crash at U.S. 41 and the access roads to the parking lots of Page Field Commons and Sam's Club resulted in the death of the driver of another car Edith Herrera Zamora 41 and injury to a passenger Maria Ramirez.

The case against Armstrong for the fatal crash is pending and he faces charges of hit-and-run involving serious bodily injury driving without a license causing death driving without a license causing bodily injury burglary trespassing and resisting arrest.

In the robberies according to police and court documents Armstrong used a gun to rob a 7-Eleven convenience store in North Fort Myers on June 14 2019. During this robbery Armstrong struck one of the store employees in the face with his gun.

On July 31 2019 Armstrong used a firearm to steal more than $151000 from a vault at the Bank OZK in Punta Gorda.

On September 25 2019 Armstrong and Zirk attempted to rob a PNC Bank in Davenport.

Zirk carjacked two vehicles earlier that morning holding the victims at gunpoint documents show. Armstrong and Zirk later used one of the carjacked vehicles as a getaway car following the attempted PNC Bank robbery. The robbery failed after the bank’s alarm went off.

The following day Armstrong Zirk and Legg robbed a BB&T Bank in Altamonte Springs during which Armstrong and Zirk threatened to kill the bank employees and used guns to force the employees to open the bank’s vault. They then stole about $22000 in cash from the vault.

Legg helped plan and purchase supplies for the BB&T Bank robbery and the attempted PNC Bank robbery. She also served as the getaway driver for these two robberies.

Information gathered from toll records and from license plate readers helped investigators track a vehicle they believe Armstrong used to travel from Fort Myers to the Orlando area and back. The banks in Altamonte Springs and Davenport are in the Orlando area.

On Dec. 9 2020 Legg was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Zirk was sentenced on Dec. 16 2020 to 22 years and 4 months in prison.

The federal Hobbs Act cited in the charges against Armstrong is used when there is an intent to rob including conspiracy and a scheme of two or more to commit a robbery.

This case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation with assistance from the Altamonte Springs Police Department the Fort Myers Police Department the Hernando County Sheriff’s Office the Lee County Sheriff’s Office the Orange County Sheriff’s Office the Orlando Police Department the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office the Pasco Sheriff’s Office the Punta Gorda Police Department the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office and the Tampa Police Department.

GUANGZHOU China — If you talk about chipmaking two companies usually spring to mind — Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung Electronics. The two Asian firms combined control more than 70% of the semiconductor manufacturing market. The U.S. which was once a leader lags behind in this space after monumental shifts in the business models in the semiconductor industry. But a global semiconductor shortage and geopolitical tensions with China have bolstered Washington's scrutiny of the supply chain which is concentrated in the hands of a small number of players and has created a drive to bring manufacturing back to American soil to regain leadership. The U.S. has earmarked billions of dollars and is reportedly looking at alliances with other nations. Semiconductors are critical to everything from cars to the smartphones we use. And they have also been thrust into the center of U.S.-China tensions. ""One characteristic of US policy is that it has heavy emphasis on China. This has now become a national imperative to enhance self-sufficiency in semis production accelerated by the recent chip shortages and the 'tech war' against China"" Bank of America said in a note published Wednesday.

How Asia came to dominate manufacturing

The key to understanding the geopolitics of semiconductors which countries dominate and why the U.S. is trying to boost its domestic industry lies in coming to grips with the supply chain and business models. Companies like Intel are integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) which design and manufacture their own chips. Then there are the fabless semiconductor firms which design chips but outsource manufacturing to so-called foundries. The two biggest foundries are TSMC in Taiwan and Samsung Electronics in South Korea.

Over the last 15 years or so companies began shifting to this fabless model. TSMC and Samsung took advantage as they began to invest heavily in leading-edge manufacturing technology. Now if a company like Apple wants to get the latest chip for their iPhone produced they have to turn to TSMC to do it. TSMC has 55% foundry market share and Samsung has 18% according to data from Trendforce. Taiwan and South Korea collectively have 81% of the global market in foundries highlighting the dominance and reliance on these two countries as well as on TSMC and Samsung.

""In 2001 30 companies manufactured at the leading edge however as semi manufacturing grew in cost and difficulty this number has fallen to just 3 firms"" — TSMC Intel and Samsung according to a note from Bank of America published in December. However Intel's manufacturing process is still behind that of TSMC and Samsung. ""Taiwan and South Korea have become leaders in wafer fabrication which requires massive capital investment; and part of their success over the last 20 years is due to supportive government policies and access to skilled labour forces"" Neil Campling head of technology media and telecoms research at Mirabaud Securities told CNBC by email.

The complex supply chain

While TSMC and Samsung are the dominant manufacturers of semiconductors they still rely heavily on equipment and machinery from the U.S. Europe and Japan. The companies that make these tools required by foundries are known as semiconductor capital equipment vendors or ""semicap"" for short. The top five semicap equipment vendors make up nearly 70% of the market according to Bank of America citing Gartner data. Three of the five are U.S. companies one is European and one is Japanese. Netherlands-based ASML is the only company in the world that can make so-called extreme ultraviolet (EUV) which is required to make the most advanced chips such as those manufactured by TSMC and Samsung.

What is the U.S. planning and why?

So the U.S. is not necessarily falling behind in the semiconductor industry as a whole. Some of its firms are integral to the supply chain. But one area it has lagged in is manufacturing. Under President Joe Biden the U.S. is looking to regain leadership in manufacturing and secure supply chains. In February Biden signed an executive order which involves a review of the semiconductor supply chain to identify risks. As part of a $2 trillion economic stimulus package $50 billion was earmarked for semiconductor manufacturing and research. A bill known as the CHIPS for America Act is also working its way through the legislative process and aims to provide incentives to enable advanced research and development and secure the supply chain.

Meanwhile U.S. firm Intel last month announced plans to spend $20 billion to build two new chip factories and said it will act as a foundry. This could offer a domestic alternative to the likes of TSMC and Samsung. Part of that scrutiny on the supply chain has been prompted by a global chip shortage that's hit the automotive industry. The coronavirus pandemic accelerated demand for personal electronics like laptops and games consoles just as industrials and automakers wound down production. But a rebound in production plus heightened demand for chips in various sectors has triggered a shortage. The concentration of production in the hands of TSMC and Samsung has worsened the problem. The semiconductor supply shortage ""has probably made the U.S. administration realise they aren't in control of their own destiny"" according to Mirabaud Securities' Campling. But there are also geopolitical factors at play informing U.S. policy. ""Over the longer-term the Biden administration wants to continue to encourage both foreign and U.S. semiconductor manufacturers to expand capacity in the U.S. to reduce dependence on manufacturing in geopolitically sensitive areas such as Taiwan and create high paying engineering jobs in the U.S."" Paul Triolo head of the geo-technology practice at Eurasia Group told CNBC by email.

Part of the U.S. policy in the semiconductor space involves forming alliances. Earlier this month the Nikkei reported that the U.S. and Japan will cooperate on supply chains for critical components like semiconductors. The two sides will aim for a system where production is not concentrated on specific regions like Taiwan the Nikkei said. ""The U.S. is trying to cut China out of the equation"" Abishur Prakash a geopolitical specialist at the Center for Innovating the Future a Toronto-based consulting firm told CNBC via email. ""It is trying to redesign how the world's chip industry works in the face of a rising China. This is not necessarily about self-sufficiency although Washington would welcome this. Instead it is about building up critical sectors — from AI to chips — that are insulated from geopolitics. And because several nations share U.S. concerns about China the U.S. is taking a chunk of the world with it.""

China's push for self-sufficiency

China meanwhile is trying to push self-sufficiency amid U.S. moves to cut it off from key supplies. Over the past few years China has tried to boost its semiconductor industry through huge investments and incentives like tax breaks. But China remains well behind everywhere else and that goes back to the supply chain. SMIC is China's largest foundry a competitor to the likes of TSMC and Samsung. But SMIC's technology is several years behind that of its Taiwan and South Korean rivals.

In the United States which has among the worst infection rates globally the number is 9 in 100.

Worldwide about 2 in 100 people are known to have had the coronavirus.

America’s prisons jails and detention centers have been among the nation’s most dangerous places when it comes to infections from the coronavirus. Over the past year more than 1400 new inmate infections and seven deaths on average have been reported inside those facilities each day.

The cramped often unsanitary settings of correctional institutions have been ideal for incubating and transmitting disease. Social distancing is not an option. Testing was not a priority inside prisons early in the pandemic. With little public pressure political leaders have been slow to confront the spread.

The virus shot through many institutions leaving inmates desperate for ways to avoid getting sick. At Pickaway Correctional Institution in Ohio which housed about 1900 inmates they tried to turn bedsheets into tents to separate themselves; four in five inmates were infected anyway.

At an immigration detention center in Farmville Va. nearly every detainee — 339 in all — was infected. And at the Fresno County Jail in California where most inmates are held on charges for which they have not yet been convicted more than 3800 were sickened.

Inmate infections in U.S. correctional facilities State facilities Federal facilities 100 1000 2000 cases HoverTap for more information + – + Note: Only facilities with known cases are shown. Data is through March 31 2021.

Starting in March of last year New York Times reporters tracked every known coronavirus case in every correctional setting in the United States including state and federal prisons immigrant detention centers juvenile detention facilities and county and regional jails.

We measured the pandemic’s excruciating impact on prisoners using records requests and interviews with people from all corners of the system. We spoke with incarcerated people and their families prison wardens jailers prosecutors defense attorneys and civil rights groups.

A year later one in three inmates in state prisons are known to have had the virus the data shows. In federal facilities at least 39 percent of prisoners are known to have been infected. The true count is most likely higher because of a dearth of testing but the findings align with reports from The Marshall Project and the Associated Press U.C.L.A. Law and The COVID Prison Project that track Covid-19 in prisons.

The virus has caused misery and loss in many places but its destructive power has been felt intensely among the incarcerated who have been infected at rates several times higher than those of their surrounding communities.

Early in the pandemic the coronavirus hit the Black population in the U.S. particularly hard with disproportionate rates of deaths which health experts attributed in part to disparities in care. While racial data is not available for cases of coronavirus in prisons African-Americans are overrepresented in the system accounting for 33 percent of inmates but making up just 13 percent of the nation’s population. For that reason public health officials say they are more likely to be among those infected in prisons.

The virus has killed prisoners at higher rates than the general population the data shows and at least 2700 have died in custody where access to quality health care is poor.

A month after a parole board approved the commutation request on his life sentence Bruce Norris 69 was still in custody awaiting the Pennsylvania governor’s signature when he died from the coronavirus. In a crowded Texas federal prison Andrea Circle Bear 30 was serving a two-year drug sentence. She died from the virus shortly after giving birth while on a ventilator.

Alan Hurwitz 79 had lung and throat cancers. He was denied compassionate release several times from the North Carolina federal prison where he was serving for a series of bank robberies. When he was finally freed he fell ill on the flight home. A medical examiner determined that he died of the coronavirus.

These deaths and many of the more than 525000 infections so far among the incarcerated could have been prevented public health and criminal justice experts say.

Prisons and jails are sometimes so crowded that three inmates sleep in cells designed for one person. Prisons have not adequately quarantined sick inmates and have often not required testing for correctional officers. Inmates have also been given low priority to receive vaccinations even as cases have continued to rise.

“Corrections institutions have continuously failed to take even the most basic life-saving measures to protect incarcerated people from Covid-19” said Maria Morris a senior staff attorney for the A.C.L.U.’s National Prison Project.

A year into the pandemic prison officials around the country have acknowledged that their early approach was muddled and based on trial and error. The novelty of the virus some said made early decisive action nearly impossible because so little was known about how it spread. In some states the disorganized response lasted well into the pandemic.

“It feels like we’re holding this together with bubble gum and packaging tape” Todd Ishee the state commissioner of prisons in North Carolina said in an interview in December.

In addition to inmates more than 138000 prison and jail correctional officers were sickened and 261 died according to the Times data.

There were many reasons for the rapid spread of the virus in prisons but several common problems drove outbreaks at every type of facility. The challenges remain steep even now and infections among the incarcerated continue to climb.

Despite warnings many prisons were unprepared to handle the virus.

Alvin MurrayAlvin Murray 71 was relieved when he learned last February that he would be transferred to the Duncan prison a state facility for older inmates about 100 miles north of Houston. The salt and pepper in the chow hall was a sign that conditions were better there than in his previous prisons. At one facility Mr. Murray who was convicted of arson and property theft and was serving a 20-year sentence had nearly died of pneumonia his relatives said.

“We were hoping that when he moved to Duncan he would be safe” said Nelda Cramer Mr. Murray’s sister.

Rufus H. Duncan Geriatric Facility prison Diboll Texas Inmate infections 279 Inmate deaths 21

By then public health officials were warning wardens that prisons needed to take precautionary measures against the virus especially for older inmates. Health officials said that without basic steps including social distancing better sanitation and less crowding correctional institutions had the potential to become incubators for the virus.

Few states heeded these early warnings and many focused their efforts on keeping the virus out of prisons — including prohibiting family visitations — rather than preparing to handle outbreaks once the virus got inside. One Texas prison failed to supply sufficient soap left sinks in disrepair and banned hand sanitizer a court found.

In other states prisons continued transferring inmates from one facility to another often failing to test them first. Others did not enforce rules requiring guards to wear masks.

But inmates and civil rights groups say the most significant impediment to containing the virus has been the crowding that has become prevalent in U.S. prisons. Since the 1980s the nation’s prison population has increased by more than 500 percent and about 1.4 million people — more than half of them Black or Hispanic — are now behind bars.

States have so many inmates that gyms have been converted into housing areas recreational yards have been shrunk or eliminated to accommodate more beds and prisons have shifted from cells to dormitory-style housing with inmates sleeping in double- or triple-tiered bunks that fill nearly every bit of floor space.

The changes have meant that when the virus entered a prison it spread quickly. At Duncan it hopped from bed to bed last summer infecting three-quarters of inmates.

Jeremy Desel a spokesman for the Texas prison system said the authorities did everything possible to keep the virus at Duncan under control including intensive cleaning of the facility extra soap for inmates and extensive testing. He said those actions saved lives.

But in the end 279 inmates and 66 staff members were infected and Mr. Murray and 20 other inmates and one staff member died.

Prisons did not move quickly enough to test employees or provide contact tracing.

Prisons and jails have only sporadically traced the contacts of infected prisoners and guards to understand who was at risk of exposure. This has inhibited their ability to prevent the virus from entering facilities and to limit its transmission public health officials said.

Oakdale federal prison complex Oakdale La. Inmate infections 620 Inmate deaths 9

Early in the pandemic one of the hardest-hit places was the Oakdale federal prison with about 1900 inmates in rural south Louisiana. An outbreak there infected 689 inmates and guards and nine inmates died.

At Oakdale an investigation by the Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector General found that a series of mistakes by prison officials and rules violations by staff members had allowed the virus to proliferate.

The report found the virus appeared to have been introduced by a Bureau of Prisons teacher who visited New York City in March 2020. There was no evidence that the prison had screened the teacher or tested him before he resumed teaching inmates. (The Bureau of Prisons declined comment about the Oakdale outbreak.)

On March 11 the day after the teacher resumed instruction he reported feeling ill. Still he kept teaching and students who were housed in different parts of the sprawling facility mingled in his classroom.

Eight days later inmates started complaining of symptoms. The prison did not screen inmates consistently for the virus and staff members did not wear masks or other protective gear while transporting and guarding sick inmates at hospitals.

It was not until March 26 that protective gear was distributed. By then hundreds were believed to have been infected though the precise number is not known because the prison did not start testing inmates until mid-April.

A later round of contact tracing identified the prison’s Education Department as the common nexus: The first four inmates to test positive shared a class and the first inmate to die was an assistant to the teacher who had fallen ill.

Testing was slow for inmates even for those who showed signs of illness.

A year into the pandemic a vast majority of states have tested all of their prison inmates for the virus at least once though more frequent testing would be ideal for people living in such cramped quarters. And several states including Alabama Georgia and Mississippi have yet to test everyone.

Note: Infection and testing rates are calculated using the maximum population for each state system since May 2020.

Alabama’s prisons have among the lowest testing rates and the second-lowest case rate of all state prison systems — but among the highest coronavirus death rates in the nation suggesting the virus is going undetected until it is too late. In some instances even the deaths may be undercounted.

Colony WilsonA coroner determined that Colony Wilson a 40-year-old inmate at an Alabama women’s prison died last May from a pulmonary embolism — a blood clot in the lung.

Neither the coroner nor the prison tested Ms. Wilson for the coronavirus but inmates said Ms. Wilson had symptoms including trouble breathing. At the time about 10 virus cases had been reported at the prison.

“They say she had blood clots in her lungs — that didn’t sit well with me” said Sylvester Wilson Ms. Wilson’s uncle. “How did she develop that just like that?”

Birmingham Women's Community Based Facility and Community Work Center Birmingham Ala. Inmate infections 17 Inmate deaths 0

On May 10 2020 — a Sunday — two days after Ms. Wilson first complained of trouble breathing she was told to fill out a sick slip other inmates said.

But before her appointment she passed out twice — each time in front of prison staff members inmates said.

The second time Ms. Wilson lost consciousness she died inmates and her family said. She had been serving a 20-year sentence for aggravated child abuse.

Samantha Rose a prison system spokeswoman said Ms. Wilson had not exhibited coronavirus symptoms and therefore did not meet the prison’s medical rules to be tested. She declined to discuss inmates’ descriptions of Ms. Wilson’s illness and officials did not respond to assertions about how staff members responded.

Kristi Simpson deputy to the prison system’s chief of staff wrote in an email that a departmental investigation had been conducted and that “foul play and suspicious circumstances were both ruled out.” Ms. Simpson added that investigators had taken witness accounts into consideration but she declined to comment further.

In the Alabama prison system’s official data there are just 17 infections for inmates and 28 for correctional officers — and no deaths — recorded at Ms. Wilson’s prison. A quarter of inmates have never received a test.

Outbreaks overwhelmed many facilities infecting nearly every prisoner.

“Man down! Man down!”

Inmates say those panic-filled words rang out of the walkie-talkies of guards several times a day as the coronavirus ripped through California’s San Quentin State Prison in June eventually killing 28 inmates and infecting more than 2200 others — about three in every five prisoners.

Some died in their sleep. Some were too ill to stand. Some passed out and never regained consciousness.

Rahsaan Thomas “Fifteen minutes ago a nurse came through they had their mask on all the way on covering their nose and their mouth because she said Covid is everywhere in San Quentin except north block and west block” Rahsaan Thomas an inmate told reporters in June. “So it’s heavy right now.”

Older prisoners placed handwritten signs outside their cells that read “Immune Compromised” so that guards would wear masks around them. Other inmates refused to leave their cells out of fear of catching the virus.

Mr. Thomas said in June that he was primarily concerned about older inmates who make up a large percentage of the San Quentin population. But at 49 he admitted he was also worried about himself.

“I don’t want to see them die” Mr. Thomas said before adding: “I don’t know if I’m tough enough to survive Covid.”

San Quentin State Prison San Quentin Calif. Inmate infections 2243 Inmate deaths 28

The outbreak began after officials transferred more than 100 medically vulnerable inmates to San Quentin from the California Institution for Men a Southern California prison.

The men who had been transferred used the same showers and ate in the same dining hall as other San Quentin inmates. Ninety-one of them later tested positive for the virus.

Within a few weeks a vast majority of inmates at San Quentin were infected. Mr. Thomas was one of the few who were not. Hundreds of prison staff members also were infected and one died.

At least 124 facilities nationwide faced outbreaks that were similar to or more severe than San Quentin’s with at least 60 percent of inmates infected.

Ralph Diaz secretary of the state’s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation was questioned about the flawed transfer by a State Senate committee in late June.

“Could we have done better in many instances? Of course we can” Mr. Diaz said. Weeks later he announced his resignation.

Few governors granted widespread releases of inmates leaving the most vulnerable in custody.

Clarence Givens For months Clarence Givens 70 stayed in his 6 by 8 foot cell at Stanley Correctional Institution in Wisconsin isolating with his cellmate. He had asthma relied on a breathing machine for obstructive sleep apnea and was frightened of getting sick.

Mr. Givens in prison for heroin possession said that he was hoping to be released early though he had not filled out paperwork seeking compassionate release. He died from Covid the authorities said in December.

Only a handful of states have released more than a few thousand inmates early despite calls from a variety of groups and some prosecutors to reduce prison populations amid the pandemic.

Stanley Correctional Institution Stanley Wis. Inmate infections 421 Inmate deaths 3

“We talk among each other” Mr. Givens wrote to a reporter a few weeks before his death. “And the main thing is we are very worried because we think the guards are going to bring it in and make us sick. Who knows if we survive that?”

Ultimately 421 inmates and 135 correctional officers at Stanley were infected and three inmates did not survive.

Once Mr. Givens fell ill in November other inmates said they aided him as best they could. He continued to stay in his cell.

“He wasn’t eating too much for days but I did force him to drink our juices they gave us to eat some fruits water and I finally got him to eat some soup and some cereal the whole pod donated vitamins some Emergen-C vitamin C teas vitamin D and other vitamins from canteen and I just kept having him take them and drink plenty of fluid” an inmate wrote to Mr. Givens’s wife. “I had to assist him in it all cause he couldn’t barely sit up or even dress.”

John Beard a prison system spokesman cited health care privacy laws in declining to answer questions about Mr. Givens.

Tens of thousands of people awaiting trial were held in local jails where the virus was surging.

Local jails are transitory places. Most people in a typical jail will eventually be released usually within a few days. They post bond for charges like shoplifting or public drunkenness or reckless driving and return home waiting for their court date.

The churn of people has meant that some of the nation’s largest virus outbreaks have occurred in county jails.

Last spring courts around the nation canceled trials and hearings to try to stop the virus’s spread. But that pause in the courts left many inmates who could not post bail languishing in jails with a heightened risk of exposure.

Nickolas Lee On Feb. 4 2020 Nickolas Lee 42 was transferred to the Cook County Jail in Chicago accused of violating his parole on an armed robbery conviction. He was initially scheduled to appear in court two weeks later. Then court dates were canceled and then suspended indefinitely.

When the virus started spreading there in late March the jail had yet to distribute face masks to inmates. Instead he wrapped a T-shirt over his nose and mouth said his wife Cassandra Greer-Lee.

Cook County jail Chicago Inmate infections 1491 Inmate deaths 10

The Cook County Sheriff’s Office said that it had initially not distributed face masks to inmates because the C.D.C. said at the time that hospitals were most in need of existing supplies. The jail began providing masks to inmates in April 2020. More than 2600 inmates and guards at the jail have been infected and 14 have died.

“Since the beginning of the pandemic the Cook County Sheriff’s Office has followed and consistently exceeded the guidance of public health experts including the C.D.C. with regard to Covid-19 interventions” Matthew Walberg a spokesman for the sheriff’s office said.

Nearly 60 days after his arrest Mr. Lee was rushed to the hospital where he tested positive for the virus. He died six days later. Barred from visiting him Ms. Greer-Lee said she was on the phone with her husband not long before he passed away.

“I will replay hearing him gasp for air the last day I talked to him — I will remember that for the remainder of my life” she said.

Slow vaccinations and the threat of variants leave an uncertain landscape.

Prisons’ pandemic response has improved by some measures in the past year — testing especially at intake and mask-wearing are more widespread. But prisons were built with security in mind and not to act as hospitals or hospices. Given the age and poor health of many inmates they remain especially vulnerable to infection and illness.

In recent weeks more contagious variants of the virus have appeared in prisons in Colorado Michigan and elsewhere. Public health officials say the presence of variants in prisons is likely to be more widespread than known because most facilities do not regularly screen for them.

Early in the nation’s vaccination program incarcerated people in most states were not given priority to be inoculated though they have an elevated risk of infection and death. By April most states had announced plans to vaccinate prisoners in subsequent months.

Still many inmates and correctional officers have been reluctant to get the shots according to state prison systems and jails. All of it has left the likelihood of eliminating future outbreaks uncertain public health experts say even after much of the nation is vaccinated.

“It’s inevitable once that new strain gets here it’s going to spread like wildfire” James Moore an inmate at G. Robert Cotton Correctional Facility in Michigan said in an interview last month. “It’s inevitable. So we’re basically just sitting back and biding our time until we get sick.”",,,
UBER,Uber,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZmVlLm9yZy9hcnRpY2xlcy9ob3ctY29sb21iaWEtcy1jcmFja2Rvd24tb24tdWJlci1pcy1odXJ0aW5nLXRoZWlyLXRyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLWluZHVzdHJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Colombia's Crackdown on Uber Is Hurting Their Transportation Industry,"In his essay “Transportation in the Free Market” corporate executive Lovett C. Peters complains that “regulation of transportation is not in the best interest of the consumer. Regulation deprives him of access to the free market.”

These lines would not be out of place in an op-ed about the conflict that is currently raging in Colombia between government licensed traditional taxi services and ride sharing apps such as Uber Lyft and Cabify. Mr. Lovett was in fact writing about Boston taxi medallions in 1967.

Wi-fi and smartphones may have changed the way transportation services are delivered but they have not changed the debates over regulation and the free market. The artificial scarcity that Lovett objected to in 1967 Boston is the same as the one created for taxicabs in 2021 Bogota and in many ways the consequences are worse. Free market competition between traditional taxis and ride sharing apps should be allowed in Colombia and other Latin American countries where it will result in faster more efficient and most importantly safer service.

Transportation customers in Colombia have long suffered from poor service inflated prices and assaults perpetrated by Colombian taxi services. Consumers in Colombia complain that taxi drivers often do not want to take them to their destination are not available in peak hours and make them wait for an unreasonable amount of time for service. Furthermore taxi drivers frequently take longer routes in order to charge more. This is even more common when the customer is unfamiliar with the city or an international tourist. Many Colombian taxi drivers use a variety of techniques to overcharge customers. One method is to round the fee up. For instance if the meter shows $6.700 pesos they charge $7.000 pesos. In other cases the taxi driver pretends not to have change forcing the user to give up the remaining value.

What taxi users fear most however are the assaults and the crime that has become known as express kidnapping. In 2013 the DEA agent James Watson was killed in a taxi cab robbery. He was the victim of what is known as “millionaire ride.” During this kind of robbery the “passengers are taken to a spot where a driver´s accomplices are waiting. The victim is then driven to cash machines where they are forced to withdraw money.” At that time around 200 similar cases were reported and the police said that fifty or sixty percent of taxi cab robberies are never reported. In 2018 15 percent of robberies were perpetrated when the victim was using a transportation service. Predictably this long list of abuses has made Colombian citizens reluctant to use taxi services at all.

In 2013 Uber arrived in Colombia as an alternative transportation service offering high quality service at an affordable price. Uber enjoyed a good reception from users. It not only provided fast affordable and convenient service but also provided many unemployed people with a new job opportunity. In 2016 around 30000 drivers worked for Uber Colombia an average of 3 hours per day. By the end of 2019 Uber Colombia had 88000 drivers and 2 million users. Uber brought a short-term economic opportunity for both users and drivers.

In Colombia traditional public transportation services are highly regulated. Taxi drivers must have a special license and purchase a medallion “that gives drivers the opportunity to own the right to operate.”

The Uber smartphone app as well of those of similar ride sharing services also creates an added level of security for users. The service allows users to see the exact mileage charge per mile and amount to be charged to their debit or credit card. Users do not have to worry about having exact change to pay for the service. The information from each ride is recorded and accessible. It is possible to know the driver’s name reviews experience and availability. That information can help reduce the assaults and express kidnappings. The tracking features of the smartphone apps give consumers an extra level of confidence when using the service increasing the frequency of use.

In Colombia traditional public transportation services are highly regulated. Taxi drivers must have a special license and purchase a medallion “that gives drivers the opportunity to own the right to operate.” Also they need to be tax registered. The cost of the medallion or “cupo” is between 75 and 150 Colombian millions ($25000 to $50000 dollars). This can be as much as three times the cost of the taxi itself. The “cupo” creates an artificial shortage where supply is reduced and prices are high. Taxi drivers pass this cost to consumers while Uber drivers do not. Uber drivers also do not have to comply with any of the transport regulations in Colombia which means they can afford to charge less for the service.

Unfortunately the Colombian government has taken extreme measures to prevent innovation in the transportation sector and repeatedly sided with traditional taxi services over Uber and other ride sharing services. Although there was no explicit law banning ride sharing apps in Colombia the drivers’ lack of a ‘cupo’ has made them the target of the Transito police and users have posted multiple reports of police harassment of Uber drivers.

The current status of the transportation market in Colombia is unfair to all parties in different ways and must be changed through pro-market regulation.

The Colombian courts have also been friendly to traditional taxi services. As reported by Cruz Mantilla on December 20th 2019 “the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce ordered the immediate cessation of Uber services in Colombia.” Uber Colombia was accused of unfair competition customer deviation and anti-competitive conduct. On December 30th 2019 Uber disputed the court case and initiated legal actions to protect foreign investments under the free trade agreement between Colombia and The United States of America. Uber left Colombia on February 1 2020. However at the same time it announced that a similar Uber application would work temporarily. It attempts to get around the ruling by calling itself a car and driver rental service. Cotech the company that filed the initial suit against Uber Colombia already plans to sue over the new application.

The current status of the transportation market in Colombia is unfair to all parties in different ways and must be changed through pro-market regulation. As previously discussed the artificial shortage of taxi services created by the government has been inconvenient unfair and even dangerous for consumers. It has impeded innovation in the form of smartphone applications and prevented the additional supply created by tens of thousands of Colombians who are willing to try driving for Uber and other companies. This has created a new unregulated black market for rideshare drivers. It is also unfair to the traditional taxi drivers despite their support for the current system. Due to their higher costs from the ‘cupo’ and other regulations they cannot compete with the rideshare drivers on price. Because the traditional taxis are less accountable to consumers the abusive behavior of some drivers has given all of them a bad reputation.

A free market in which traditional taxis and a variety of ride sharing apps compete on equal terms would help to resolve the problems with taxi cab service in Colombia. Competition will improve the service and prevent abuses by providing better prices faster service flexible payments and greater tracking of rides and drivers. It will also eliminate the demand that drives the ‘black market’ Uber network that currently operates in large cities like Bogota. A free-market for cab services offers workers access to the “on-demand” economy and the possibility of working as independent contractors who manage their own hours location and frequency. Further increased competition in Colombia’s transportation sector will create more available supply and therefore lower prices for the users. If traditional taxi drivers are freed from the high costs and burdensome regulations currently in place they may be able to compete on price and service. The free market will encourage businesses and individuals to continue to innovate and improve services.

Unfortunately governments like the one in Colombia are uncertain as to how they should classify and possibly regulate Uber drivers and Colombia’s track record with taxis has created the current undesirable situation. It is possible that the policy debate will become further polarized or even corrupted resulting in legislation that is heavy handed ineffective or anticompetitive. Voters in Colombian metro areas must demand that their leaders become more efficient reliable and accountable. Perhaps a savvy tech entrepreneur will one day develop an app for that too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL2ZpbmFuY2UueWFob28uY29tL25ld3MvbW9yZS10aGFuLWp1c3QtZm9vZC1kb29yLWRhc2gtZ3J1Ymh1Yi11YmVyLWVhdHMtYWRhcHRlZC10by1jb3ZpZC0xOS1ub3ctcGxvdC1uZXh0LW1vdmVzLTE0MzQyMTk0NS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's how DoorDash Grubhub Uber Eats have adapted — and thrived — amid pandemic,"Delivery apps which have seen explosive growth during the COVID-19 pandemic are continuing to adapt to consumer demands for food grocery items and other necessities to arrive at their doorstep.

DoorDash (DASH) Grubhub (GRUB) and Uber Eats (UBER) are three platforms that have benefited from the online stay-at-home boom. In keeping with the disruptive ""Amazon (AMZN) effect"" these digital platforms are shaking up the delivery business and looking ahead as the mass vaccination effort hits its stride.

DoorDash which acquired Caviar at the end of 2019 currently boasts over 20 million consumers on the platform fielding 273 million total orders in 2020 — up a staggering 233% compared to a year prior as takeout skyrocketed during lockdowns. The company saw $8.2 billion in marketplace gross order volume — a 227% surge from a year earlier.

Grubhub — the app behind brands like Seamless Eat24 and Tapingo — says 30 million diners spent more than $9 billion in food sales in 2020 and donated more than $21 million dollars to organizations and communities in need of support.

Uber Eats’ growth continues to outperform even in the fact of a drop in its parent company's ride-sharing business. Gross bookings were up 130% year-over-year as customers unable to dine out sought delivery. To compare gross bookings for Uber’s ride sharing business plunged 50% year-over-year.

Over the past year Uber Eats which also owns Postmates scored exclusive partnerships with food giants like Shake Shack (SHAK) solidifying its growing momentum in the delivery wars.

In fact DoorDash remains the top food delivery app as of February 22 capturing 53% of U.S. market share — up a whopping 16% from the start of 2020 according to Edison Trends. The company says it’s confident that restaurants are reaching new customers thanks to the platform’s accessibility.

According to data cited by a spokesperson 75% of participating restaurants agreed that they were able to reach a new audience with the DoorDash platform. Meanwhile 65% found they were able to increase profits during the pandemic by partnering with the app.

And while OpenTable has seen a boost in reservations as mass vaccinations get underway DoorDash has linked its services to restaurant solvency. “The odds of staying in business are 8x better for restaurants on DoorDash compared to all U.S. restaurants"" a spokesperson told Yahoo Finance recently.

And the app's continued success may spell bad news for its competitors in the long run. Uber Eats and Grubhub — representing 32% and 14% of the U.S. market share respectively — saw shares decline throughout the course of the pandemic.

Story continues

Restaurants quickly adopting food delivery

The plethora of delivery options however is a boon for struggling restaurants and consumers. According to food analytics company Tastewise 73% of all U.S. restaurants are on at least one delivery platform today with 68% on Doordash 61% on Grubhub and 47% on Uber Eats.

Although DoorDash has experienced the fastest growth in recent months it is still right on par with competitor Grubhub when it comes to year-over-year expansion. Both platforms saw a restaurant increase of 6% verse May 2020.

Tastewise added that momentum for delivery continues to swing to the upside. According to the data only 11% of all U.S. restaurants were available on all four major delivery platforms in January 2021 but that number quickly increased to 16% in early April.

Overseas retail investors have fed into the hype of delivery giants although performance has weakened. On March 31 shares of Amazon-backed Deliveroo opened for trading on the London Stock Exchange. Yet the stock quickly swooned embarrassing the company and raising pointed questions about the future.

More than just food

In February Uber announced it would buy the alcohol delivery service Drizly (Brendan McDermid / reuters)

One of the undeniable trends shaping the delivery business is the consumer's defining need to get what they want when the want it prompting industry participants to seek alternative ways to expand beyond food. Uber's $1.1 billion deal for Drizly back in February underscores how the brand best known for ride-sharing is branching out aggressively.

“In a world where a consumer can go to a centralized spot [for delivery needs] you're starting to see the other categories and the expectation from the consumer side that you should be able to get them instantly"" Drizly co-founder and CEO Cory Rellas told Yahoo Finance recently.

Uber Eats also recently expanded its partnership with prescription delivery company Nimble to Chicago and Atlanta at the end of March.

But they're not the only ones moving beyond their core competency: DoorDash accelerated its convenience category at the height of the pandemic to include 7-Eleven Wawa Casey’s General Store and Circle K. And last August the app brought CVS (CVS) and Walgreens (WBA) into the fold — launching DashMart a digital convenience store to allow local businesses and restaurants to provide household essentials.

In March DoorDash announced its plan to deliver at home COVID-19 tests with Vault Health and Everlywell. And The Wall Street Journal reported recently the company's plans to “launch its own rewards credit card” with offers from more than ten banks and financial tech companies to issue it.

“In many ways this pandemic has sharpened our dedication to empower local economies and deepened our obsession with serving the needs of our customers” Liz Jarvis-Shean DoorDash's VP of communications and policy told Yahoo Finance in an email.

Community Support

DoorDash Partnerships

Delivery apps have also strived to connect with individual communities by being more charitable bridging the gap between local restaurants and socially distanced diners.

At the start of the shutdown Grubhub created its Community Relief Fund that raised over $15 million to provide financial relief for restaurant partners and drivers. The platform also partnered with the Restaurant Strong Fund on a $2 million initiative to grant eligible restaurants $10000.

“We’ve helped restaurants attract retain and maintain customers during these challenging times and we’ll keep working to earn their business and support them through the recovery and beyond"" Kevin Kearns. Grubhub's SVP of restaurant network told Yahoo Finance in an email.

Uber Eats launched a similar campaign in early February titled Eat Local. As part of the initiative Uber pledged to spend $20 million to support local restaurants financially impacted by the pandemic.

DoorDash using its social impact arm Project Dash that launched back in 2018 aimed to tackle the food insecurity crisis that was highlighted throughout the pandemic. Through partnerships with government agencies and nonprofit organizations DoorDash delivered approximately 13 million meals to communities hit by food insecurity and emergency frontline workers in the U.S. and Canada.

Additionally the company has pledged to provide 1 million deliveries in 2021 through Project Dash as part of its five-year $200 million dollar Main Street Strong Pledge to uplift local communities.

But today as Uber is getting the top ranking among the PHV operators we are going to have a clear overview of Uber cars and Uber car rental. If you are planning to join Uber or you are already a member but looking for an Uber car rental London company don’t miss to read this article.

Taking a cab is a vital and viral issue all around the world. This issue made creative people think of a new and unique idea like Uber. Every one of us every day takes taxis to different destinations. But Uber car rental was a new program that was announced in April 2018 in the Uber app. In this article we will get to know this program better and see some important details.

The article includes the following items

Uber car rental in the UK

Requirements of hiring an Uber car rental

What factors to consider when hiring a car

Conclusion

Uber car rental in the UK

Are you in the UK and looking for a PCO car to rent? Then you have 2 options:

Rent a car directly from Uber

Rent an Uber ready car from Uber hire car UK companies

Although Uber itself offers drivers car rentals it is good to know that Uber has a contract with vehicle partnerships so it can’t be considered a direct car rental in London. Besides you can read on the Uber website that they are not responsible for the products and services of other companies. Then Uber hire car UK companies to become a better option so let’s see what they offer.

Uber ready vehicles refer to those cars which have all the requirements of Uber including insurance TfL checklist and any other licenses and documents needed to be sent to Uber. As soon as you choose a PCO car hire in London you can simply start the process of becoming an Uber driver. It is good to know that a great Uber car rental London company offers free documentation upload which can quicken the process of activating your Uber account.

There are a few things you need to provide when you want to have a PCO car hire which can be less or more based on the companies’ standards.

Requirements of hiring an Uber car rental

The company we overviewed for this article was G&M direct hire. Based on this company’s requirements if you want to have an Uber car rental in London prepare the following list of documents:

A valid national insurance number

A valid PCO license

A valid driving license

First-week rental fee (plus the deposit fee if you don’t want an instalment)

The new drivers might not know enough about PCO license so let’s see what it is and how you can receive one.

PCO license

PCO (public carriage office) license is the degree the TfL committee gives through testing you to evaluate if you are a qualified driver in the UK or not. The test is done on:

Map reading (topographical test)

Language proficiency (English test)

Health condition (Medical tests)

Background test (by offering DBS certification)

The results show your status and based on the status it will be decided if you are in good condition to receive a PCO license and become a private hire driver. Once you get a PCO license it is valid for 3 years and you can apply for PCO cars or PHV operators. Note that after 3 years you need to renew it and the renewal has a few steps as well.

What factors to consider when hiring a car?

Now the most important question is what car to hire in the UK? Are all the vehicles provided with a suitable choice? What car would have fewer expenses or make me save more? Well this is what we are going to cover thoroughly in this section.

First of all you are the one who chooses the car among the options. There might be a dream vehicle for you out there which makes you not see any other good vehicle or you might already own a dream car and look for a low-cost vehicle. Therefore this is totally up to you. But if you don’t have any special choice considering a few factors can help you to choose an appropriate PCO car hire in London.

The fuel consumption

Consumption of a car is a critical factor as you may spend up to half your earnings on this issue. Note that the Uber car rental being petrol-based or electric-based can change the expenses as well. For example a full electric PCO car hire is free of congestion fees while normal cars are not so you can save this expense. Besides you can be an environmentally friendly PCO driver by having an electric car. However electric cars are quite more expensive. Thus if you can afford it hire an electric car.

Capacity of the PCO car hire

The more riders you take the more money you make! This is a fact that when you pick a family or a group of friends the fees are higher and you are most likely to earn more tips. You can hire an Uber car rental in London from 4 to 7 passengers through G&M direct hire. Although you can find more ride options by a 4 passenger vehicle.

Weekly rental fee

Rent an Uber car in London that you can afford. It doesn’t make sense to hire a PCO car in London when you can’t pay off the rental fee. If you are a new driver we suggest you hire cheaper vehicles for the first weeks to experience how you can earn. Then decide if you can have a better Uber car rental in London or not.

Hiring a car for Uber can be done in two ways:

Choosing the Uber car rental program.

Choosing a PCO car hire company to rent a car.

The second choice refers to all companies with a similar field of G&M Direct Hire which offer you different PCO Uber ready cars and you can immediately join Uber after renting a PCO car.

Conclusion

Considering the factors mentioned hiring a PCO car to join Uber or other rideshare apps is a better choice. Note that before hiring a PCO car in London search about the car you want and prepare all the required documents to boost the speed of the hiring process. We hope reading this article would be a useful piece of reading and make it easier for you to decide to rent a PCO car in London.

The quartet had just struck at the Interstate Shopping Center off Route 17 on Thursday when Maywood Detective Sgt. William Phayre headed to the Ulta store at Bergen Town Center further down the highway and waited.

Sure enough the four suspects pulled up in the rear parking lot of the Maywood Ulta Phayre said.

Officers Benjamin Singer and Keion Best quickly pulled in and chased the crew a short distance to the intersection of Forest Avenue and Shephard Way in Paramus the sergeant said.

A warranted search of the vehicle turned up $7200 worth of stolen perfume and $1800 or so in suspected illegal proceeds he said.

Arrested were the driver Alexis P. Robinson 23 of South Daytona Florida along with passengers Keyshawn R. Middleton 23 and Quadir T. Barley 21 of the Bronx and Sean Cousine Jasper 20 of Manhattan.

Maywood police charged all four with receiving stolen property and conspiracy. Robinson Middleton and Barley were also charged with money laundering. Robinson also was charged with eluding.

Ramsey police also charged them with similar offenses.

All four were sent to the Bergen County Jail while detectives from law enforcement agencies across the tri-state area assembled information.

The very next day however a Central Judicial Processing Court judge in Hackensack released all four pending further court action.

I didn’t follow anybody. No one knew who I was.”

Mikayla Nogueira didn’t have much of a social media presence when she downloaded TikTok last year. She was on March break from Bryant University and simply looking for something to occupy herself with. She spent hours flipping through videos on the app and eventually stumbled across the viral “Catfish Challenge” wherein people film themselves before and after putting on makeup.

Between the video going viral and her studies going virtual because of the pandemic Nogueira seized the moment and continued posting daily to @mikaylanogueira from her bedroom in East Freetown. She gained a steady flow of followers during her first month on the app but it wasn’t until she uploaded a video featuring her voice that the account truly took off.

“I remember the exact video” Nogueira says recalling the expletive-filled Boston accent-heavy makeup contouring tutorial she uploaded last April. She was “so nervous” about what people might think about her thick Massachusetts accent but was met with overall positive feedback.

“That was like the first video where I was just being fully myself and I was shocked by the response” she says. “That video blew up as well. And from there that just sort of inspired me to start doing tutorials and reviews and more videos where I’m just speaking.”

In the last year Nogeuira amassed over 4.7 million followers and was named the Emerging Makeup Artist of the Year at the 2020 American Influencer Awards. She even caught the attention of Selena Gomez who quoted Nogueira’s “what’s poppin’?” catchphrase in a personalized video to the makeup artist.

“Y’all I am doin’ a giveaway” she says in a video where she offers free makeup to fans. In another clip when she breaks down her lip routine she says “smells like watermelon feels wicked good.” Everything she does is infused with her Boston accent.

Part of the appeal of Nogueira is the sheer volume of her uploads. In a year when maintaining a makeup routine became obsolete for many she made a habit of uploading 15- to 60-second video clips several times a day. Nogueira says she always does her makeup regardless of whether or not she’s going out so the pandemic was no exception.

“I love makeup so much that doing it every single day is the best part of my day” she explains. “To be honest it’s just so exciting. I’m always so happy about it. It’s definitely just passion. I think that translates in my videos for sure.”

Nogueira’s fascination with makeup began at age 10 but she didn’t start practicing on other people until high school. Her mother is an artist as well and she sees similarities in what they do.

“I also love [art] but I do it on my face instead of on a canvas” she says. “So there is that correlation.”

The game changed when she finally got a job at Ulta Beauty in 2019 after repeatedly applying to both Ulta and Sephora. When she received a call saying that they were interested in interviewing her Nogueira says she showed up with a full face of makeup and was hired that day. She worked as a Prestige Beauty Advisor which meant she was trained in every product and had the opportunity to work on people every day. She still credits a substantial amount of her knowledge with her time at the company.

“Ulta was just a great way for me to really build my knowledge as a makeup artist and lover” she says.

Since graduating from Bryant and leaving Ulta she’s turned her TikTok account into a full-time career as a beauty content creator. After the makeup samples began to add up in her parents’ home last fall she found her own apartment where she films her videos.

Nogueira plans to move again this fall in order to find a space where she can create a YouTube studio and expand her brand. Ideally she’ll get to stay in Massachusetts and says that she’d only consider going the way of many makeup artists and moving to Los Angeles if it became necessary for her job.

“I love New England so much. I’m such a Masshole. I really am. I just embody the definition of Masshole” she says. “I really would love so much if I could stay in Massachusetts.”

The singer shared two new snapshots that showed her posing for a new Designer Brand Inc – the company that owns DSW stores – collection after partnering with them last year. In one of the eye-catching snapshots she’s wearing a white mesh dress that includes a hood and white sneakers and in the other she’s showing off an orange jumpsuit that was open in the front and orange heels. Check out the pics HERE.

She also accessorized in the second photo with silver hoop earrings but no ring was seen. “Floating into the weekend 💙 ☁️ 🧡 #JLoJenniferLopez @dsw 📸: @richardburbridge #linkinbio to shop” she wrote in the caption of the pics. Once she shared the post fans were quick to point out how lovely she looked.

“You look amazing” one fan wrote while another told her she looked “flawless.” A third gushed that she was “so pretty” and a fourth called her a “fashion icon.” Many others appropriately left her heart-eyed emojis.

Jennifer’s latest photos without her engagement ring come just a few days after she also went ringless for pics in InStyle magazine. Before that she got attention for not wearing the engagement ring last month when she posted a different professional photo for DSW. These pics come in the midst of speculation that she split from longtime love Alex who she became engaged to in Mar. 2019.

The speculation started after Page Six reported that the couple called off their wedding and their four-year romance on Mar. 12. They denied the report within a day and told PEOPLE “We are working through some things” as Jennifer was in the Dominican Republic shooting her upcoming movie Shotgun Wedding and Alex was at home in Miami. The former New York Yankees player visited her on the island a few days later and they were even spotted kissing but her engagement ring has yet to be seen back on her finger."

U.S. carriers including Southwest Airlines Co. American Airlines Group Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. parked a combined 67 of the workhorse planes Friday about a third of the Max jets currently in service around the world. The manufacturing fault affects aircraft at 16 airlines not the entire Max fleet Boeing said in a statement.

Chicago: Boeing Co. grounded dozens of 737 Max jets to repair an electrical flaw that emerged just months after the planes were cleared to return to the skies forcing airlines to cancel flights and line up replacement aircraft.

While the issue isn’t related to the flight-control system that was at the center of the Max’s nearly two-year grounding it takes the luster off the comeback of Boeing’s most important product. The Chicago-based planemaker has been picking up orders for the Max since U.S. regulators lifted the grounding in November and recently secured a bumper commitment from Southwest which had publicly flirted with a smaller single-aisle jet made by Airbus SE.

Boeing slipped 1% to $252.38 at 9:52 a.m. in New York the biggest drop on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The shares had gained 19% this year through Thursday twice as much as the Dow.

The newest Max disclosure comes as Boeing contends with quality lapses and manufacturing flaws that have damaged its reputation and affected its 787 Dreamliner KC-46 aerial tanker and Starliner spacecraft. The aerospace titan also has fired and sued a subcontractor on another high-profile project: turning two 747 jumbo jets into the next Air Force One fleet to haul U.S. presidents.

The latest issue was discovered by Boeing mechanics “on a production airplane during normal build activity” according to a message to customers that was reviewed by Bloomberg. Operators were notified just hours after a separate email touting the growing number of flight hours and planes in service since the grounding ended in the U.S.

Boeing declined to say how many planes were affected of the 183 Max jets that have been put back into service since December. About 20 operators have been conducting about 400 daily flights according to a separate memo.

“Boeing has traced the issue to a production change made in the installation process that occurred after our last aircraft was delivered before the fleet grounding in March 2019 which means 24 of our 737 Max aircraft are not affected by this issue” David Seymour American’s operations chief said in a message to employees Friday.

Boeing’s wouldn’t estimate how much time the repairs will require. “It could take a matter of hours or a few days” said Jessica Kowal a Boeing spokeswoman.

Airline impact

Southwest said it pulled 30 737 Max 8 jets from its schedule adding that it’s flying only 15 of its 58 Max planes daily and expects “minimal” disruption to its operations. The Dallas-based carrier said it hasn’t experienced any operational problems related to the electrical issue identified by Boeing.

American removed 17 Max planes from service while United stopped flying 16 and Alaska halted flights by four.

The Max Boeing’s latest generation of the decades-old single-aisle workhorse was grounded after two crashes five months apart in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019 in which 346 people were killed.

It was cleared to fly again by U.S. regulators in November with regulators in Europe and most other major markets following suit.- Bloomberg

While millions of Americans are still waiting for their third stimulus check — or an extra ""top-up"" payment — some lawmakers and advocates are pushing for a fourth direct payment. And maybe more.

More than 75 members of Congress say that until the pandemic is over there should be regular stimulus checks. President Joe Biden is being urged to wrap them into the $2.3 trillion infrastructure spending plan he's now promoting.

Just a fourth stimulus check could lift more than 7 million people out of poverty according to an analysis from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

But those pulling for more checks are facing considerable resistance. Here’s where things stand on whether you'll get another ""stimmy"" this year.

'Families shouldn't have to worry'

S.Borisov / Shutterstock

Millions of Americans are still in financial distress with about 4 in 10 saying their income remains below its prepandemic levels according to a recent survey from the credit bureau TransUnion.

Back in January 56 House Democrats led by Minnesota’s Ilhan Omar sent Biden a letter urging him to consider recurring stimulus payments.

“We are experiencing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression with millions of Americans either unemployed forced out of the workforce or facing a decline in hours and wages” the letter said.

And at the end of March 21 Democratic senators joined the chorus of voices calling for more payments. ""Families shouldn’t have to worry about whether they’ll have enough money to pay for essentials in the months ahead"" the senators wrote Biden in a separate letter.

Many households have used stimulus money to cover basic expenses like groceries and rent according to a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics study of how last year's very first checks were spent.

Once those needs were met some of the cash was used for saving and investing the bureau found or for other expenses that may have included buying affordable life insurance. Demand for those policies has surged during the pandemic.

New checks face major obstacles

Support for more stimulus checks is far from universal. Last month the Democrats who control Congress struggled to push through Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID rescue package which provided $1400 stimulus checks and many other benefits.

The bill passed with simple majorities using a streamlined process that required no support from Republicans — who all voted no.

Even moderate members of the Democratic party weren’t in agreement about the need for the third round of payments so there may not be enough political support for further stimulus checks.

Story continues

“I think it’s unlikely at this time” Raymond James analyst Ed Mills tells CNBC.

Another reason not to hold out hope is that the Biden’s administration has turned its focus to other priorities including the massive infrastructure bill. So far the White House hasn't commented on whether relief payments might be included.

But that's looking less and less likely with more Americans getting vaccinated by the day. The stock market is hitting new highs hiring is booming and life appears to be on its way back to normal — lessening the perception of the need for more economic stimulus.

What to do if you need money right now

If you can’t wait for lawmakers to decide whether to send out more stimulus checks and you need cash ASAP you have some options.

Cut the price of your debt. Credit and debit card spending increased in March by 45% compared to the same period last year according to data from the Bank of America. If you’re relying on your credit card you'll soon be dealing with a ton of expensive interest. Rein in your debt — and pay it off more rapidly — by rolling your balances into a lower-interest debt consolidation loan.

Shrink your insurance bills. Car insurance companies have been offering customers discounts as everyone has been driving far less through the pandemic. If your insurer won't negotiate it's time to shop around for a better deal. And while you’re at it you could save hundreds by comparison shopping find a lower price on homeowners insurance.

Stop procrastinating and refinance your mortgage. If you've got a mortgage and haven't tried to compare rates and refinance your loan in the last year you're missing out. The mortgage data and technology provider Black Knight recently said 11.1 million homeowners still have the potential to save an average $277 a month through a refi.

Grow your spare change. A popular app helps you get investing returns quickly using ""spare change"" — it rounds your everyday purchases up to the nearest dollar and drops the difference into an investment account so you can take advantage of the record-shattering stock market.",,,,,,,,,

Most rent out workout gear such as exercise bikes and yoga mats

Sweatspot SG has since seen an average of eight customers daily who took up their SHN package

One firm expanded its catalogue of products for rent to include household items

SINGAPORE — After returning from Canada in December last year Ms Ginny Leow 51 bought books and a small basketball hoop to occupy her 13-year-old son while they served their 14-day stay-home notice (SHN) in a small hotel room for two weeks.

But it did not take long until the feeling of being in a “high-class prison” kicked in so Ms Leow thought the best way to release their pent-up energy was to rent an exercise bike.

“I joked with my friends that I rented the bike to bring out my inner hamster” said Ms Leow who has another daughter aged 17. “Exercising keeps you on a routine makes you feel alive even when you are alone and the endorphins probably help to relieve the stress of being cooped up.”

Ms Leow paid S$350 to rent the bike for two weeks from equipment rental company Sweatspot SG.

Mr Ian Berclaz who founded the company in March last year said they were initially providing equipment rental services to those stuck at home during the circuit breaker last April.

“Almost immediately when Singapore rolled out the mandatory SHN to travellers we thought this is a market we can tap” said the 47-year-old.

And they were right as customers quickly made bookings as soon as they launched.

“One of my customers had run out of ways to exercise in his small hotel room. He actually pushed his bed to the middle of the room and ran around it every day” said Mr Berclaz.

Sweatspot SG has since seen a daily average of eight customers who took up their SHN package which consists of rental of one exercise bike a pair of dumbbells one yoga mat and a subscription to online exercise videos.

Mr Berclaz said the biggest challenge is reaching prospective customers who are usually from out of the country.

BEYOND EXERCISE EQUIPMENTS

With no end in sight for the Covid-19 pandemic more firms offering similar services have also been sprouting up.

In February Ms Mounia Nasser 36 started SHN Sport which provides sports equipment rental to travellers serving SHN.

Along with her business partner Ms Nasser thought of the business idea when her friend asked her to send his exercise bike to the hotel he was serving his SHN at after returning from France.

“He trained for 14 days and rode almost 40km a day on his bike. He found that training not only kept him fit during SHN but entertained and distracted him and allowed him to stay focused during work hours” she said.

With the aim of helping customers “care for their mind body and soul” Ms Nasser said once an order placed on its website is processed the equipment would be delivered on the same day.

Rental rates range from S$128 to S$185 for 14 days according to the type of bike she added.

“We then collect the equipment at the concierge to clean and sanitise for the next customer” said Ms Nasser.

Although she declined to reveal the number of bookings SHN Sport has seen Ms Nasser said their exercise bikes have been highly requested. The pair is also looking to expand their catalogue of items as demand grows.

Workout equipment may be popular among those who want their cardio fix but there are also others who might need items they commonly find at home.

That is why Mr David Lee 35 provides rental services for “anything one might need during quarantine”.

Having experienced SHN twice the founder of Happy SHN provides rental for items such as food steamers laser printers a microwave and even a gaming console.

Customers can also send in a request for products that are not listed in the catalogue said Mr Lee.

He came up with the idea after having to serve SHN upon returning from South Korea in May and the United Kingdom in December where his experiences being confined to two different hotels varied.

While the first hotel had everything he needed — he even had an Espresso machine in the room — the second one left him wishing for things like a vacuum cleaner a humidifier and a fan.

“The room was dry and dusty but all the hotel could provide was a broom which I understood because they couldn't possibly provide a vacuum cleaner for every room.

“I contemplated buying the vacuum cleaner online but after some consideration about the delivery time cost-effectiveness of buying a full product just for 14 days and what to do with it after the SHN I dropped the idea” said Mr Lee.

To rent products from Happy SHN customers place a deposit which depends on the value of the item and the rental fees will be deducted from the deposit while the remaining amount will be refunded after the rental period ends.

It can cost about S$300 to rent an air purifier and S$80 for a vacuum cleaner for two weeks.

“There is definitely a demand for services like this” said Mr Lee. “Since Singapore is looking to become the vaccine distribution hub in Asia I think we will have put in place SHNs much longer than the rest of the countries.”",,,,,,,,,

The company is preparing to sell or list a minority stake in order to draw more global investors who are seeking to capitalize on quickly-growing FinTech assets.

MTN currently has 280 million global subscribers and added almost 12 million new users to its mobile money arm for a total of over 46 million in 2020.

Ralph Mupita company chief executive said that the unit should be worth at least $5 billion to $6 billion. He said the group would be spinning it out within the next year.

MTN is listed in Johannesburg and had rolled out the separation plan last month as part of a shift in strategy. The shift will cut $3 billion in net debt FT reports.

The group is aiming to tap into the burgeoning investor interest for the mobile money business built up by African telecoms over the past decade which allow phone subscribers to send or receive money outside of banks and more often sell ancillary services including microinsurance.

MTN’s mobile money business has over double the 21 million users of rival Airtel Africa FT writes and the group’s financial services interests also have an insurance joint venture with more than 10 million customers.

With the move MTN is also anticipating some regulatory scrutiny in Africa with more complex financial services wholly owned by mobile phone companies.

MTN rival Airtel Africa has recently closed a deal for $100 million which gave Mastercard a 3.75 stake in its business and valued it overall now at $2.65 billion.

Raghunath Mandava chief executive officer (CEO) of Airtel Africa said the investment from Mastercard would help the company’s mission of reaching underserved regions with new financial tools.

That investment also boosted the company’s existing relationship with Mastercard including “extended commercial agreements” and an updated “commercial framework” for numerous geographies and payment methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Opposition party ACT-Wazalendo has criticised the government over newly launched National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) schemes alleging that it sought to exploit people through provision of basic services hence calling it to halt their implementation.

The opposition party claimed further that the insurance packages were aimed at creating social classes in accessing health care services arguing that no human person ever chooses to fell sick or suffer from one kind or other of disease.

However Health Community Development Gender Elderly and Children Minister Ummy Mwalimu yesterday used her Twitter handle @umwalimu to warn various groups and individuals from misleading the public on the new insurance packages.

“Stop misleading the public on the health insurance contribution rate by workers it remains 3 per cent of one’s salary while the employer contributes another 3 per cent. No changes has been done on the contribution rate by employees. This is according to the National Health Insurance Fund Act Cap 395 Section 9” she responded.

The minister further clarified responding to a tweet by ACT-Wazalendo party leader Zitto Kabwe: “My brother let’s not bring politics in this matter. The packages are entirely voluntary. No one is forced to enrol in one form or the other. Besides the packages have not replaced the Community Health Insurance (CHF) arrangement where the annual contribution rate remains Sh30000 for a household consisting of up to six members. In addition children’s and farmer’s packages are still available.”

However she said the ministry would continue receiving opinions and suggestions from the public on NHIF packages with the aim of improving them as the ultimate goal is reaching the universal health cover.

A single beneficiary from the informal sector will contribute starting from a minimum Sh192000 as membership fee compared to Sh1.5 million (per individual) which was previously charged by the national health insurance firm.

Speaking yesterday ACT-Wazalendo party secretary general Dorothy Semu argued that the NHIF new schemes was continuation of turning basic services into business and creating social classes.

“There are classes in the provision of health care services. The procedure of the packages is taken that the issue of someone suffering from a disease is voluntary and that a person can choose to become sick or not” she observed.

New Delhi: National Safe Motherhood Day is an initiative of the non-profit organisation White Ribbon Alliance (WRA) working with an aim to ensure that pregnancy and childbirth are safe for all women and newborns. In 2003 Government of India declared that the country will observe this day on April 11 every year becoming the first country to do so. The country decided to observe National Safe Motherhood Day on April 11 to honour Kasturba Gandhi on her birth anniversary.

Importance Of National Safe Motherhood Day

White Ribbon Alliance decided to observe National Safe Motherhood Day each year with an aim to raise awareness about adequate access to care during pregnancy childbirth and postnatal services along with a focus on reducing anaemia.

The day also calls for the prevention of child marriages because it may be an indirect cause of maternal deaths as per WRA.

It is the right of every woman to take good quality nutrition proper healthcare services during and after pregnancy and childbirth says WRA.

Facts About Maternal Mortality

Approximately 830 women die every day from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth as per WHO.

Worldwide maternal mortality has dropped by about 44 per cent in between 1990 and 2015 reports WHO.

50-98 per cent of maternal deaths are caused by direct obstetric causes – hemorrhage infection hypertensive disorders ruptured uterus hepatitis and anaemia says the WHO.

Skilled care before during and after childbirth can save the lives of women and newborn babies as per WHO.

Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) of India for the period 2016-18 as per the latest report of the national Sample Registration system (SRS) data is 113 per 100000 live births declining by 17 points from 130 per 100000 live births in 2014-16.

Sustainable Development Goal 3

As part of the Third Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) countries have united behind a new target to accelerate the decline of maternal mortality by 2030. The target of this SDG is to reduce the global MMR to less than 70 per 100000 births with no country having a maternal mortality rate of more than twice the global average.

Government Initiative To Ensure Safe Motherhood

There have been many national initiatives by the government to ensure safe motherhood for women. Most prominently Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakaram (JSSK) was launched in 2011 to motivate those who still choose to deliver at their homes to opt for institutional deliveries.

Under the initiative every woman who is pregnant becomes eligible to deliver child in public health institutions for free of cost which also includes cesarean births.

The entitlements also include free drugs and consumables free diagnostics free blood if required and free diet for three days during normal delivery and seven days for C-section. Furthermore JSSK provides free transport from home to institution. These entitlements are also applied to pre and post-natal complications of pregnancy.

Nutrition An Important Aspect To Ensure Safe Pregnancy And Motherhood: Expert

Dr. Meena Sawant Secretary at Indian Society of Perinatology and Reproductive Biology (ISOPARB) suggests that maternal nutrition is the foundation stone for a child’s growth and development. Moreover it is also critical for a woman’s health and well-being across life stages but especially pregnancy. She says

Many mothers face problems of nausea and vomiting loss of appetite and unusual cravings. All of these may affect the nutrition of the mother. Most of these can be tackled with time and doctor’s prescription. Knowledge about the right food is essential for the mother and her family members.

NDTV – Dettol Banega Swasth India campaign is an extension of the five-year-old Banega Swachh India initiative helmed by Campaign Ambassador Amitabh Bachchan. It aims to spread awareness about critical health issues facing the country. In wake of the current COVID-19 pandemic the need for WASH (Water Sanitation and Hygiene) is reaffirmed as handwashing is one of the ways to prevent Coronavirus infection and other diseases. The campaign highlights the importance of nutrition and healthcare for women and children to prevent maternal and child mortality fight malnutrition stunting wasting anaemia and disease prevention through vaccines. Importance of programmes like Public Distribution System (PDS) Mid-day Meal Scheme POSHAN Abhiyan and the role of Aganwadis and ASHA workers are also covered. Only a Swachh or clean India where toilets are used and open defecation free (ODF) status achieved as part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014 can eradicate diseases like diahorrea and become a Swasth or healthy India. The campaign will continue to cover issues like air pollution waste management plastic ban manual scavenging and sanitation workers and menstrual hygiene.

BY LIZWE SEBATHA.

With a population of about 200 000 according to the last 2012 census results Binga is on the shores of the Zambezi River which means lots of water.

There is a lot of boating activity for tourists and villagers who were cut off from their folks in Zambia following their displacement from their ancestral lands in the Zambezi River banks to pave the way of the construction of Kariba Dam.

While the boats mostly single dinghies inflated before being propelled using pedals carry people for visits they also serve as couriers and mini-ambulances for villagers seeking health services in the neighbouring country.

According to Section 76 of the country’s constitution every citizen and permanent resident of Zimbabwe has the right to access basic health care services including reproductive health.

However it is a right that many Binga villagers do not usually enjoy as the district has few clinics with the available ones several kilometres away lacking basic medications and drugs and battling shortages of nurses and doctors.

Private pharmacies price their drugs beyond the reach of many and in United States dollars forcing villagers to canoe to the neighbouring country to buy medication for a fraction of what is charged in the country.

“It’s a disaster. I still remember at one time at Binga District Hospital; they were transferring every case to either St Lukes’ in Lupane or Bulawayo because they could not handle cases because of several challenges facing the institution” said Prince Dubeko Sibanda the former legislator for Binga North.

“The highest point of health care owned and government-run in Binga starts with Binga District Hospital.

“To be very honest Binga District Hospital faces several challenges from human capital to lack of drugs and medicines.

“That is why you find most people finding it better to travel to Zambia for health services.”

Several wards such as Siachilaba Chinonge and Lubu in Binga do not have clinics The Citizen Bulletin established.

Chinonge ward brings together 11 villages such as Kamwabulede Sanungu Tobwe Gwatagwata Kampandu Musazi Sikomena 1 Sikomena centre Muunde Malokota and Kamalundu.

“Then we have Manjolo clinic which we constructed as citizens about 25 kilometres from Binga centre that is not functional” Sibanda added highlighting the sorry state of Binga’s health care facilities.

Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being at all ages is essential to sustainable development the United Nations says.

The right to health care also falls under the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 which speaks to the need to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages.”

“Achieve universal health coverage including financial risk protection access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe effective quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all” reads one of the SDG goals.

The SDGs or Global Goals are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals adopted by member states in 2015 designed to be a “blueprint to achieving a better and more sustainable future for all”.

However for Binga villagers its health care system’s poor state shows the district is far-off from meeting the SDG 3.

Binga Rural District Council CEO Joshua Muzamba bemoaned the poor state of health facilities in the district. He recently sent out an appeal to build new clinics particularly for wards without any.

The Binga council runs four clinics namely Nsenga Sinansengwe Pashu and Chipale clinics and they are located at Sinakoma Sinansengwe Pashu and Sinamagonde wards respectively.

“We will continue to mobilise resources to support the health institutions from our resources and support from partner agencies and development stakeholders operating in the district” Muzamba said.

Currently Binga RDC is constructing two clinics at Malaliya (Pashu ward) and Zambezi (Siansundu ward) using devolution funds.

Farai Marinyame the Binga district development coordinator added: “The health facilities we have are inadequate to cater for the whole district; very much inadequate in terms of reach as people are forced to walk long distances to cross the border.

“We still need more health centres in Binga.”

While Muzamba and Marinyame were coy on the number of clinics needed for the district Sibanda made it clear that they need “at least 30 clinics constructed; that’s two clinics per ward”.

However as resources do not permit villagers have to continue risking their lives crossing the Zambezi River in small boats to access health care services.

The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) insists that the new health insurance packages which were launched at the end of last week aim at increasing healthcare coverage - especially for people who work in the private sector and the informal economy.

Speaking at an NHIF meeting with journalists in Dar es Salaam yesterday the NHIF director general Mr Bernard Konga said the newly introduced packages - namely ‘Najali’ ‘Wekeza’ and ‘Timiza’ - will enable more people to access healthcare products and services as a matter of course. Hitherto Mr Konga said the health insurance scheme mainly covered workers in the formal economy. Under the new packages membership fees are pegged at Sh192000 Sh384 000 and Sh516 000 respectively for Tanzanians aged from 18 to 39 years.

“We introduced the new packages in order to increase health coverage to many people who works in private an informal sectors” Mr Konga said dismissing claims that NHIF have now decided to adopt a business model thereby abandoning the service-based one. The Fund came under criticism from social media users as well as some organization like the Alliance for Democratic Change (ACT)-Wazalendo political party following the launching of the new schemes.

ACT-Wazalendo claimed that the NHIF sought to exploit people through the provision of basic services and urged it to halt their implementation. but the director general played down the allegations. The ACT-Wazalendo further claimed that the insurance packages were aimed at creating social classes in accessing healthcare services.

In response Mr Konga said “The government endorsed our proposals because we are targeting the majority of Tanzanians... The move is very important as we are heading toward universal health coverage.”

He added: “claims that we are sidelining some people who suffer from certain diseases don’t hold water because you can’t fund the treatment of a cancer patient who has contributed only Sh192000 for a year.”

Since the launch of the new schemes last week 700 people have been enrolled as new NHIF members.

Speaking during the meeting Mr Christopher Mapunda director of customer’s services at NHIF said that for the past three years NHIF expenditures for specialized treatment has increased from 15 spent to 20 per cent. According to him NHIF spent a total of Sh204.4 billion in 2015/16 Sh263.48 in 2016/17 and Sh371.11 billion in 2017/18."

UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) has awarded the funding to support the second phase of a £37 million programme that will create new jobs while decarbonising the economy.

The programme is being led by the South Wales Industrial Cluster (SWIC) – a partnership of organisations from the English border to Pembrokeshire’s coastline that’s working to promote green energy and decarbonise industrial areas of Wales.

Phase two of the programme involves engineering studies to explore routes to decarbonisation including the use and production of hydrogen supply carbon capture usage and storage and CO2 shipping from South Wales.

Projects in the pipeline are expected to create around 5000 new jobs in clean energy production securing up to 113000 industry and manufacturing jobs.

Cllr Rob Stewart Chairman of the Swansea Bay City Region’s Joint Committee said:

“This funding is a major step forward for the drive to further carbonise Wales’s economy while creating thousands of jobs and helping Wales achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. “Several projects forming part of the Swansea Bay City Deal investment are also focused on green energy and decarbonisation so this programme will continue to support and complement other on-going initiatives in South West Wales. “Together with other investments the programme being led by the South Wales Industrial Cluster will help accelerate the Swansea Bay City Region’s economic recovery from Covid-19 but in a green and sustainable way that will leave a positive long-term legacy for generations to come. “The City Region supported the bid for this funding so I’m delighted that it’s been successful.”

The South Wales Industrial Cluster deployment programme led by Costain has been granted the phase two funding following the completion of phase one assessments looking at decarbonisation schemes and the infrastructure required for a hydrogen economy in South Wales.

The project is supported by a range of partner organisations from the industrial academic law public and private sectors working across South Wales to create the world’s first net zero emissions industrial zone.

De igual forma está el caso de Marco Fabián que dejaron ir al Eintracht Frankfurt de la Bundesliga por cerca de 5 millones de dólares y después de varias transferencias en junio de este 2021 quedará totalmente libre pues se acaba su contrato con FC Juárez y podría regresar al club de sus amores.

En la medular

Sin duda el mayor aporte que podrían tener sería el de Orbelín Pineda a quien dejaron ir a Cruz Azul por 13 millones de dólares y que actualmente extrañan como interior y su aporte creativo además del tiro de media distancia. Con Cruz Azul no ha renovado y termina contrato en diciembre de 2021 por lo que tiene posibilidades de regresar aunque sean muy escasas.

Un zaguero

El defensa central Carlos Salcedo la quinta venta más cara de Chivas por 6 millones de dólares al Eintracht Frankfurt al igual que Fabián posteriormente ha sido un constante en la Selección Mexicana y aunque ha vivido altibajos con Tigres UANL se trata de un buen aporte en la zaga central.

Estos futbolistas mencionados son parte de las ventas Top 10 del Rebaño de forma que sin duda darían un salto de calidad a la plantilla misma que actualmente parece corta para un club tan importante como Chivas. Estos elementos representan 49 millones de dólares que han hecho un bien a las arcas Rojiblancas pero parecen haber costado más en lo deportivo.

Sin embargo desde la llegada de los monoplazas de F1 híbridos la complejidad técnica que supone manejarlos y manipularlos debido especialmente a su parte eléctrica (incluso por el peligro que ello entraña) hace que directamente estos ejemplares no salgan al mercado.

Sin embargo un Fórmula 1 muy especial parece haber roto con esa condición y ha aparecido en el mercado. Se trata del Toro Rosso SRT14 con el que Pierre Gasly consiguió su primer podio en la Fórmula 1 prácticamente bajo la bandera de cuadros en el Gran Premio de Brasil de 2019. Sí ese mismo que también le dio su primer podio a Carlos Sainz aunque en su caso fuera unas horas después tras una sanción a Hamilton.

Una venta poco habitual

El hecho de que aparezca este monoplaza de F1 híbrido a la venta es aún más sorprendente si cabe porque normalmente los equipos no pueden vender mononoplazas del año actual o de los tres años anteriores sin el consentimiento de la FIA pasa así no revelar secretos sensibles de los propios equipos.

Todo esto hace que encontrarse con el SRT14 que le dió a Gasly su primer podio casi con una foto finish sea una auténtica sorpresa. Los encargados de la venta son GPCars4Sale que señalan que este ejemplar fue exactamente el chasis 04 que llevó Alex Albon desde el GP de España de 2019 y que tras su promoción a Red Bull Racing y consecuente bajada de Gasly al segundo equipo de la bebida energética a partir del GP de Bélgica tras el verano acabó en manos del francés. Sin embargo desde ese momento la suerte de Gasly cambió sacando todo el partido de este Toro Rosso hasta el punto de encontrarse con un inesperado podio en Brasil donde un Safety Car le aupó hasta la tercera posición que posteriormente pasó a ser segunda después del accidente entre Hamilton y Albon. Con el Mercedes dañado Gasly consiguió adelantar a Hamilton y mantenerse en segunda posición a pesar de los ataques del campeón.

El motor Honda se queda en casa

Tras aquel podio este SRT14-04 se vendió a un coleccionista holandés una vez de obtuvo el permiso de la FIA. El coche de hecho mantiene incluso su componentes electrónicos y su caja de cambios secuencial de ocho velocidades aunque por cuestiones que ya se entienden tras todo lo contado no incluye ni su motor ni su ECU ni su sistema hidráulico. El coche se muestra actualmente con el número 23 de Albon aunque parece que el asiento sigue estando hecho a la medida de Gasly.

Y si te preguntas cuánto cuesta hacerse con un F1 moderno hoy en día sentimos decirte que no tenemos la respuesta. GPCars4Sale señala que habrá que estar realmente interesado en él para conocer su precio de venta así que si te sobra un buen puñado de dinero en el banco invertirlo en un F1 como este puede ser interesante.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGljaWFzZGVnaXB1emtvYS5ldXMvZ2lwdXprb2EvMjAyMS8wNC8xMS9pcnVuLWVzdHVkaWFyYS1vcmRlbmFjaW9uLWVqZS12ZW50YXMtMzcwMTIwNS5odG1s0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubm90aWNpYXNkZWdpcHV6a29hLmV1cy9naXB1emtvYS8yMDIxLzA0LzExL2lydW4tZXN0dWRpYXJhLW9yZGVuYWNpb24tZWplLXZlbnRhcy0zNzAxMjA1LmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Irun estudiará la ordenación del eje Ventas-Plaiaundi,"- En los últimos años han sido muchos los pasos que se han ido dando hacía la regeneración definitiva del espacio ferroviario de Irun. La presentación del convenio interinstitucional de Vía Irun la aprobación en Pleno de los criterios y objetivos para la redacción del proyecto la modificación de los estatutos de Zaisa para que pudiese ser la herramienta principal para gestionar toda la actuación o más recientemente la recepción en la casa consistorial de los proyectos de la futura estación intermodal y del tercer hilo que Adif ha elaborado son señales de que la regeneración está cada vez más cerca.

En este contexto el Consistorio ha querido dar un paso más al encargar un estudio de ordenación del espacio ferroviario entre Ventas y Plaiaundi. Se trata de un trabajo que como explicó el delegado de Urbanismo Miguel Ángel Páez “viene a complementar los avances que se están produciendo en todo el ámbito de actuación más inminente de Vía Irun” en referencia al entorno de la estación del ferrocarril la playa de vías más próxima y la antigua Aduana.

Según el delegado el desarrollo de dicho espacio no impide que el Ayuntamiento amplíe la lupa y empiece ya “a pensar en las oportunidades que abre Vía Irun en sus márgenes”. Por tanto el objetivo del documento será elaborar un estudio que integre una visión completa del proyecto urbano en todo el entorno ferroviario de Irun incorporando el análisis de elementos como el corredor verde previsto a lo largo del eje o las opciones que abre la iniciativa para integrar el Topo en la plataforma de Adif.

Al mismo tiempo el estudio también dará pie a ofrecer soluciones a la necesidad de derribar una serie de pasos superiores a causa del proyecto de implantación del tercer hilo en Irun. Otra de las posibilidades que se abren es la de la cubrición de vías y regeneración en torno a la conexión de las calles Lope de Irigoien y Cipriano Larrañaga y entre los puentes del paseo Colón y la variante hacia Plaiaundi.

En palabras de Páez la meta del análisis es “dibujar sobre papel posibles escenarios que se deriven de los pasos que va dando Vía Irun” un proyecto que “va a cambiar por completo la imagen de la ciudad abriendo ventanas a un mayor desarrollo y oportunidades para regenerar estos espacios que necesitan una intervención urbana”. Asimismo el delegado señaló que si el Topo acaba integrándose en Vía Irun la presentación de las oportunidades que se abrirían debería servir de impulso” para activar la regeneración de ámbitos como el de López de Becerra de iniciativa privada con múltiples pequeños propietarios.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZW1hcmtldC5jb20ubXgvbm90aWNpYXMvbWVyY2Fkby1pbm1vYmlsaWFyaW8vMzI2NTAtc2FiYWRvLWNsaWVudGVzLWZyZWN1ZW50ZXMtZGFuLWEtdmlwcy0zMC1kZS12ZW50YXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Clientes frecuentes dan a Vips 30% de ventas,"Clientes frecuentes dan a Vips 30% de ventas

Hace 12 años la cadena lanzó su programa de lealtad cuando fue la influenza AH1N1; con el Covid-19 lo relanzó e integró la tarjeta digital.

El 30% de los ingresos de la cadena de restaurantes Vips están relacionados a su programa de descuentos y lealtad y a la oferta de menús temporales esto ante la adversidad que representó la pandemia derivada del Covid-19 durante el año pasado.

Carlos Sáenz director general de Vips dijo que las ventas de los clientes frecuentes en un trimestre llegan a representar el 30% de los ingresos; “para nosotros es un pilar importantísimo el cómo podemos generar e incrementar las ventas de Vips y 2020 fue totalmente desafiante”.

Hace 12 años la cadena de restaurantes lanzó su programa de lealtad cuando fue la influenza AH1N1 ahora con el Covid-19 relanzó el programa e integró la tarjeta digital pero encontró que con la tarjeta física los clientes asisten cuatro veces más.

“En noviembre registramos casi a 200 mil nuevos clientes y estamos hablando de un mes donde el aforo era limitado eso te habla de la búsqueda de los consumidores por descuentos” mencionó Sáenz a El Financiero.

Durante el año pasado Vips cerró 11 sucursales para finalizar con 282 unidades y aunque ya opera con algunas restricciones la compañía donará el 10% de las utilidades que genere en marzo y parte de abril para apoyar la falta de propinas que han tenido sus 6 mil trabajadores.

“Aun con las restricciones no cerramos ni un solo día continuamos con paquetes navideños y ejecutivos reinventamos el canal de servicio a domicilio que tuvimos un crecimiento del 425% en delivery contra el 2019 habremos vendido aproximadamente más de 2.5 millones de platillos”.

Por otra parte el servicio a domicilio aportó el 7% de las ventas contra el 2019 que era del 1% y de éste canal el 18.3% de los pedidos fue para paquetes como cenas navideñas chiles en nogada en septiembre y el programa ‘Me Cocina Vips’ donde la firma vendía por litros y kilos productos del menú.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tdW5kb3Rvcm8uY29tL25vdGljaWEvbGFzLXZlbnRhcy1jZWxlYnJhcmEtdW4tbWFnbm8tZXZlbnRvLXRhdXJpbm8tZWwtMi1kZS1tYXlvLW9yZ2FuaXphZG8tcG9yLWVsLWNlbnRyby1kZS1hc3VudG9zLXRhdXJpbm9zLzE1NzAxNzfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Ventas celebrará un magno evento taurino el 2 de mayo organizado por el Centro de Asuntos Taurinos,"El Centro de Asuntos Taurinos de la Comunidad de Madrid está cerrando un gran evento taurino en el que estarán presentes las máximas figuras y las principales ganaderías que se celebrará el próximo 2 de mayo día taurino por excelencia en la plaza de toros de Las Ventas al festejarse el Día de la Comunidad de Madrid.

I used to go to phone retail stores with a disturbing regularity.

It was always interesting to look at new phones and ask salespeople what they really really feel about those phones.

COVID-19 has somewhat curtailed my forays into the outside world. This hasn't however stopped carrier store employees from getting in touch and well telling it how they see it.

Today let's listen to Gordon -- not his real name for very good reasons -- who recently left his job at a Verizon store after being in his words ""in the top 1% of the company for multiple years in sales.""

Gordon contacted me in a particular spirit. He told me: ""I'm not a disgruntled ex-employee but someone who legitimately believes that people are being ripped off just because they don't know any better.""

It sounded like there was some vehemence attached here. So I asked Gordon to explain.

""The company is directing employees to only offer a $17 a month insurance offer called Verizon Protect"" he said. ""This is a product that is made up of a bunch of individual products sold as a package. If someone wants coverage on their phone for lost or stolen stuff there is an option for $6.85 a month. However it was forbidden by leadership for retail employees to offer this to customers.""

This sounds a touch peculiar. There's a product you have but you don't want customers to know about?

Gordon believes the more expensive product isn't so good: ""Verizon Protect includes features like Tech Coach which is a third-party technical support line that's absolutely horrible.""

Well yes but upselling is part of the game isn't it? The company wants to make more money so it gets salespeople to push the more expensive items.

Offer You Service? That Could Cost Us.



It was another aspect highlighted by Gordon that made me stop and wonder about the meaning of (commercial) existence.

Gordon explained that previously it had been possible to make ""fairly attractive money"" by ""behaving with dignity and without pushing customers into items they don't need.""

But then came COVID-19.

""During COVID they decided to make the commission a team model"" he said. ""They also took out upgrades as a form of compensation altogether.""

Instead explained Gordon in order to get commission salespeople had to either sell new lines or accessories watches tablets and insurance. There was a new third way to qualify for commission.

""They also added in a new component that directly affected commission -- based off of customer satisfaction surveys"" said Gordon. ""If you open an account the customer got a survey. If that customer gave you an eight or below that would lower the pay for the store.""

Some might mutter this was a good move. Surely incentivizing customer service would create positive results for both customers and employees.

Oh but some salespeople looked at it a slightly different way.

""What happened is that no one would open accounts"" said Gordon. ""If the customer isn't buying something they sent them away to either the website the chat or the call-in customer service.""

Wait I wondered what does ""open accounts"" mean?

""'Open an account' would be asking for a phone number and sending a verification to the customer. You don't need to sell anything. You just go into the account to look at a bill or take a payment. Also if the customer picks up an order 'open an account' would be accessing an account.""

Essentially then some salespeople didn't want to risk being scored poorly by a customer -- and risk lowering their team's commission -- so they tried to send the customer to other parts of Verizon for help.

Which may to some feel like an exalted level of absurdity. Oddly though that's not all.

Your Service Is Not Being Upgraded.



There was another kink when it came to helping those who wanted to upgrade their phones. Explained Gordon: ""If someone upgrades a phone and doesn't buy accessories or get the top tier insurance -- or goes on a low-cost plan -- individuals are judged against that as employees.""

Gordon also pointed me to an online forum where Verizon employees express themselves heartily -- and anonymously.

Here's a sample from a Verizon salesperson addressing the company's bosses. It's a reaction to a recent company email inviting customers to come back to stores.

The salesperson pleads to their bosses: ""You think you are going to get quality when I'm abused all day and our customers had to wait forever... I'm just trying to survive the day. Do you know we are touchless and have to wear masks then catch grief all day about masks from customers?""

This has been an issue across retail and certainly at carrier stores. Yet now says this Verizon salesperson store staffing has been reduced by half.

The salesperson again: ""Do you know our SMB (small and medium business) reps hide at home and we only have the ability to help half as many customers as before and you ask us why SMB sales are down? Do you know how many new lines walk away daily due to not being staffed properly? Of course you don't. Do know how many customers come to get help at the store only to walk away in disgust because of the lack of help? Really? Does this sound like a successful business strategy?""

Not entirely I hear you sniff.

Naturally I contacted Verizon for its reaction on these issues. Has the company I asked actually seen an improvement in customer service scores since adding those scores to employee commission calculations? I will update should I hear back.

Customers Still Want Humans. But Does Verizon?



This salesperson struck on a very important issue. People still want to go to a store and talk to a real person. (I'm one of them.)

Says the salesperson to their bosses: ""You changed retail's entire landscape. Stop placing blame and understand we all want to succeed but your vision handicapped our ability to win. Your customers aren't ready and willing to do the telesales world. They don't want a chatbox. They don't want bad answers from an app.""

And there you were thinking AI is truly wonderful.

Shopping in the future: The tech behind retail

Of course this might all be kvetching from a minority. It may be that Verizon's management is trying hard to do the right thing -- or at least the right thing for its corporate purposes.

I confess I've always experienced kind thoughtful and thorough customer service in Verizon stores -- even during the pandemic. But Gordon believes the company is ""trying to make their corporately owned retail stores obsolete.""

He added: ""What customers don't realize is that a few years ago Verizon laid off all of their technical support people. Not one employee in a Verizon-owned retail store has any type of technical training on devices.""

Which would seem awkward but perversely believable.

Gordon has extremely fond memories of his years at Verizon.

Yet now he says: ""I can sleep at night. The culture was great but the new upper leadership has distorted it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdzbWFyZW5hLmNvbS9sZ192ZWx2ZXRfNWdfdXdfdmVyaXpvbl9hbmRyb2lkXzExX3VwZGF0ZS1uZXdzLTQ4NTk5LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon's LG Velvet 5G UW is receiving Android 11 update,"The LG Velvet 5G got the Android 11 update in South Korea in January and now it's the Velvet 5G UW locked to Verizon's network that's getting a taste of the latest version of Android.

Android 11 for the Velvet 5G UW comes with version number G900VM20a and March 2021 Android security. The new build also brings a new UI and the usual set of Android 11 goodies to the smartphone including chat bubbles.

If you haven't received the Android 11 OTA for the Velvet 5G UW yet you can try checking it manually by navigating to the Settings > About Phone > Software updates menu of your smartphone.

The Velvet 5G UW was announced last year with Android 10 and even though LG has promised Android 12 for a few phones despite exiting the smartphone business the Android 11 update could very well be the last version update for the Velvet 5G UW.

The LG Velvet 5G UW is a variant optimized to use Verizon's ultra-wide-band (or the eponymous UW) new-radio bands. It ran Android 10 on its release through this network and had like many other phones from this erstwhile mobile OEM been left adrift in terms of major upgrades for some time.

In fact LG had only started to roll Android 11 out to the Velvet in early 2021 and only then in South Korea and as a beta to start off with. Now however its 5G UW sibling has finally joined in on running this up-to-date UI. Verizon has just announced the necessary update for its specific version of the phone.

This OTA is termed the G900VM20a software version for the LG Velvet 5G UW and accordingly confers many Android 11-based features on the device. They include a number of new quick-setting icons: Bedtime Mode Focus Mode and Nearby Share.

Therefore Velvet 5G UW users can optimize their device to pause potentially distracting apps during work or sleep hours and also have a new option with which to send files. They can see if for their new and major update has arrived yet by going to Settings -> About Phone -> Software updates -> Check for Update.

If present it will also upgrade the Velvet 5G UW's security patch level to March 2021 which is only slightly outdated at this point.

As expected this is nearly the same smartwatch as 2019’s Fossil Gen 5 smartwatch only with cellular connectivity.

It’s now available on Verizon for $349.

Update: May 4 2021 at 3:40 PM ET: Want to learn more about the Fossil Gen 5 LTE? Be sure to check out our full review! Original article January 11 2021 (8:00 AM ET): Wear OS smartwatches with LTE connectivity are few and far between. Mobvoi has really been the only company committed to LTE Wear OS smartwatches but now we can add Fossil to that list. Fossil has announced the Fossil Gen 5 LTE it’s first-ever LTE-equipped smartwatch.

Having access to an LTE connection on your watch is invaluable to some people. It means you don’t need to have a phone nearby in order to send texts or receive calls. And because all Gen 5 smartwatches have a built-in speaker taking calls from your wrist is that much easier.

However you’ll need to be a Verizon customer to use Fossil’s new smartwatch. The Fossil Gen 5 LTE is Verizon-only at the start though Fossil says it’s working to add support for other carriers in the future. While we’re on the subject of exclusivity this is an Android-only smartwatch too. Fossil is also working on iOS compatibility though it doesn’t have a timeframe for when that may happen. Related: Wear OS in 2020: The most stagnant smartwatch platform

As the name suggests the new watch is almost identical to the company’s previous Gen 5 watches. The Fossil Gen 5 LTE has the same display processor RAM and storage configuration as the version we reviewed in 2019. That means it unfortunately misses out on Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon Wear 4100 series chipset. However we felt the performance of the 3100 chip was perfectly acceptable. Battery life was good too — thanks in part to Fossil’s custom battery modes — though it’ll be interesting to see how an LTE connection affects battery longevity.

There’s one other caveat worth mentioning: the LTE smartwatch somehow misses out on the most recent software update Fossil rolled out last August. It will launch without VO2 max estimates the new wellness app enhanced custom battery modes and more. Fossil hopes to bring this software update to the LTE variant “soon.”

You can grab Fossil’s first LTE-powered watch from its official website for $349. Conversely you can also head to Verizon and buy it there for the same price. You can also take advantage of a Verizon payment plan and pay $14.54 each month for 24 months. Two color options are available: a smoke-tone stainless steel case with black straps and a rose gold-tone stainless steel case with blush straps — both in the larger 45mm size.

But investing in clinical-stage biotech stocks can be extraordinarily risky. In this Motley Fool Live video recorded on March 31 2021 Motley Fool contributors Keith Speights and Brian Orelli discuss three critical things investors should look for before buying clinical-stage biotech stocks.

10 stocks we like better than CRISPR Therapeutics

When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.*

David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and CRISPR Therapeutics wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.

See the 10 stocks

*Stock Advisor returns as of February 24 2021

Keith Speights: There is some news from last week that you and I didn't get a chance to talk about. This is the kind of news that normally you would just overlook. But there was a small very small clinical-stage biotech Odonate Therapeutics (NASDAQ: ODT) -- the company announced that it was discontinuing development of its lead candidate after meeting with the FDA lead it to conclude the drug just wasn't going to win approval.

But what's really striking about this particular situation is that Odonate also said it's going to shut down the company altogether. And so in my view this served as a big reminder for investors about the risks of buying clinical-stage biotech stocks especially those with only one pipeline candidate like Odonate had.

Brian for investors who want to buy clinical-stage biotech stocks what are critical things they should look for to avoid this kind of situation where a company just totally goes out of business?

Brian Orelli: This is an aside I love this move -- I mean obviously not for Odonate shareholders that's obviously horrible for them -- but there's a lot of times the small biotech companies will try to milk whatever they can out of the data and trying to raise more money and that's not fair to shareholders. So shutting down trying to get as much of the capital out of the company as possible is ultimately the best news for the shareholders even though they obviously had this clinical issue with their remaining stock.

In terms of lessons I think the first is to invest in companies with multiple shots on goal. I am a big fan of Ionis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: IONS). It went down 20% earlier this last week or maybe the week before on an apparent phase III failure in Huntington's disease. But the company still has five phase III programs and something like 25 phase II programs. I'm a shareholder and the decline was certainly painful but I'm not worried about the company shutting down.

The other issue here is to make sure companies have enough capital to get them through to the next binary event or maybe even two binary events. Having a partner can certainly help with sharing the cost and the risks. An example there would be like CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP). They're partnered with Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX). They're partnered obviously on a CRISPR lead asset for beta-thalassemia and sickle cell. But they also have three other research stage programs that they are working on together.

Then finally just keep your investments to a small percentage of your portfolio. Don't let any one biotech especially one biotech with only one drug become a large percentage of your portfolio because this can certainly -- you're taking on a lot of risks that way.

The acceptance of digital currencies as a form of payment expanded greatly last week foreshadowing the increasingly important role cryptos such as Bitcoin and Ether will play in our lives going forward.

Both Visa and PayPal announced they will begin allowing the use of cryptocurrencies to settle transactions. This came a week after Tesla said it will now accept Bitcoin as a method of payment and a month after Mastercard signaled it would start supporting cryptos sometime this year.

PayPal’s Checkout with Crypto made available to select U.S. users last Wednesday gives consumers the ability to purchase goods and services at as many as 29 million merchants using Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash Ether or Litecoin.

What’s more there’s no additional transaction fee.

Founded in 1998 by Peter Thiel and Elon Musk among others PayPal has become a trusted household name. 2020 was a record year for the online payment service as people were stuck at home and companies digitized their operations. Total payment volume was a massive $277 billion a 39% increase from the previous year while the platform added 16 million new accounts for a total of 377 million registered accounts.

Very soon every one of these users will be able to use popular digital currencies to buy nearly everything from a cup of coffee to a new car. This represents a huge leap forward for the still-emerging technology.

Meanwhile Visa announced that it became the first payment processing company to settle a transaction with USD Coin (USDC) an open-source stablecoin backed by the U.S. dollar. According to the coin’s website USDC “is issued by regulated financial institutions backed by fully reserved assets” and “redeemable on a 1:1 basis for U.S. dollars.” As of March 28 there were 11.3 billion USDC in circulation.

Not only will Visa users be able to make purchases with USDC but Visa said it would also one day support new central bank digital currencies (CBDC) as they become available. According to the company some 80% of central banks are strongly considering or in the process of launching their own national digital currency.

Mastercard is reportedly doing the same announcing in February that it’s engaging with “several major central banks around the world” as they develop CBDCs. At the moment there’s no word on when Mastercard customers can expect to start paying with cryptos or even which cryptos will be supported but it seems likely we’ll hear something soon now that Visa has taken the first step.

Tesla Now Accepting Bitcoin

Currently the sixth largest U.S. company by market cap having surpassed Visa and Berkshire Hathaway Tesla has been ramping up its accumulation of Bitcoin.Those of you in the market for a Tesla may have noticed that you can already select Bitcoin at checkout only a week after Elon Musk tweeted the news.

If you recall the company disclosed that it bought $1.5 billion worth of the digital currency as part of a corporate policy that allows the electric vehicle (EV) maker to invest in alternative reserve assets including not just cryptocurrencies but also gold bullion and gold ETFs.

Musk often tweets about cryptos to his nearly 50 million Twitter followers which can trigger incredible price swings. Dogecoin surged more than 1000% from $0.007 to $0.080 in as little as 12 days in January and February after the Tesla “Technoking” tweeted about it.

Someone recently developed a bot in fact that automatically buys Bitcoin whenever Musk mentions it in a tweet. This reminds me of the Trump & Dump Bot which used artificial intelligence (AI) to identify publicly traded companies whenever they appeared in one of the former president’s tweets. The bot then shorted the stock and donated the proceeds to charity. Trump’s Twitter account was permanently suspended on January 8.

Gold Off to Its Worst Start in Almost 40 Years. Buy the Dip?

The price of Bitcoin has more than doubled so far this year and on Friday cracked the $60000 resistance level in intraday trading. Ether meanwhile is up more than 180% for the year after hitting a new record high last week.

Not every inflation hedge has been a winner though. Gold is having its worst start to the year since 1982 losing close to 12% for the three-month period even as concerns over inflation are intensifying.

Since touching its all-time high of around $2070 per ounce at the beginning of last August gold has been under pressure from steadily rising bond yields. The yield on the 10-year Treasury is currently trading above 1.7% as investors dump bonds in favor of risk assets. Bond yields rise as prices fall. The U.S. Dollar Index meanwhile rose above 93 last week which also dampened the yellow metal’s appeal.

I think it’s important to point out that gold’s investment case right now remains as strong as ever and investors would be wise to consider using this price dip as a buying opportunity. Money-printing remains at a record clip and the debt continues to be piled on. Last Wednesday President Joe Biden outlined his $2 trillion package to rebuild U.S. infrastructure a plan that will reportedly be paid for over time with tax hikes on corporations and wealthy Americans. This legislation if passed would follow the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package signed into law last month.

No Inflation? Home Prices Surge the Most in 15 Years

More economic data was released last week suggesting that inflation is running a lot hotter than what the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is reporting. Home prices in the U.S. rose 11.2% year-over-year in January marking the fastest rate since February 2006. The median price for a new single-family home in the U.S. increased to $336000 in 2020 up from $321500 a year earlier according to Census Bureau data.

At issue is rising commodity prices particularly lumber which has stalled construction of new homes. According to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) soaring lumber costs have added more than $24000 to the price of a new home.

As a result only a little over 1 million new and existing homes were available for sale in the U.S. in February the lowest level ever in data going back to 1982 the National Association of Realtors (NAR) says.

Homeownership has historically been one of the key ways Americans build wealth. But with prices on the rise buying a home may be out of reach for many families.

The good news is that Americans appear to be getting back to work. In March the U.S. economy added 916000 jobs the most since August. The industry with the biggest share of new jobs was leisure and hospitality which might not seem positive at first glance since such positions tend to be low-paying. However I see it as a further positive sign that the economy is opening back up and Americans are getting back to life before the pandemic.

It is looking like Friday those dancers will get the chance to do what they love in front of a crowd once again.

Lone Star Ballet is scheduled to present “TimeSteps: Rock of the Ages” at 7:30 p.m. Friday and at 3 p.m. Saturday at the Globe-News Center for the Performing Arts.

Unlike the majority of the ballet’s performances this production is centered around rock music from the 1950’s to the 1980’s including music from Prince The Beatles and Madonna.

Roxann Seaton the ballet’s academy director and ballet mistress said the dancers started rehearsing for this production in January in conjunction with the potential of performing “The Nutcracker” in February. Once “The Nutcracker” was officially canceled the dancers put all their energy into this jazz-centered production.

This particular production is the second time Christeen Bernet will play the role of the “Spirit of Music” in TimeSteps. In the role Bernet will narrate the history of rock music and highlight moments of history that really impacted music.

As a former dancer Bernet said she is excited to return to the stage with Lone Star Ballet.

“It brings back the sense of nostalgia of course” she said. “Being back in the studio is great. I spent most of my life here at Lone Star Ballet and then coming and doing the role again it really is just a sense of fulfillment for me. It’s been a long time since I have been on the stage. It’s truly my passion… It’s reopening the book that I’ve been wanting to open for a while.""

With this production Bernet is not the only person returning to the Globe-News center's stage after a long absence. The pandemic has kept the current Lone Star Ballet dancers away from the stage for an extended period of time.

Because of that as well as the content of the show Seaton said there has been a bit of a learning curve.

“We have tried really really really hard to give them what to our knowledge obviously and what Mrs. Vicki (McLean former artistic director for Lone Star Ballet) told us when we did it the first few times this is what’s going on” Seaton said. “This is what was happening in the world. This is how you are feeling. This is how you should be presenting this to the audience.”

But a show like this making dancers more versatile transitioning among various styles of dance will help them succeed in the professional world said Anthony Femath ballet master for Lone Star Ballet.

“They want someone to go from ballet to jazz to modern to lyrical back to ballet” he said. “That’s exactly what this show is. It puts all of that together.”

But even with the challenges of performing multiple styles Femath sees the drive and the desire of the performers wanting to get back on the stage.

“I think everybody is ready for something to happen. We are ready to go out ready to get dressed up go watch a show. I know we are ready to dance” he said. “You can see it in them. They want something. They come in every day they push so much. They are just ready to get on stage.”

Seaton said this show is the perfect way to support the arts in the Amarillo community especially after so many events were canceled and/or postponed because of the pandemic. She said she hopes that people will create memories no matter if they are older and have memories related to the songs or younger and do not know the songs.

“Support these kids. They have been working all year towards a performance and this will be the first one that they actually get to do that we’ve worked towards” she said. “Just come out support. Enjoy. Enjoy life (and) try to get some normalcy back.”

Qatar made a major donation to the Touro University Nevada’s Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities to help the institute provide adequate services for its community after a year of hardship.

Doha’s $3 million donation will allow the centre to rehire staff lost to the pandemic and make up for setbacks it faced last year according to the Las Vegas Sun.

The centre was also forced to close for three months and reduce its staff from 10 therapists who provided services to over 50 children aged 18 months-to-12 years of age to only three. The capacity was reduced to just 11 children Director Lisa Kunz said.

With the new donation “the possibilities will be endless” said Kunz noting that some parents considered transferring their children to other facilities but had now reversed their decision.

“The therapists here are amazing” Katrina Maves mother of eight-year-old Caleb Maves said. “I don’t know where we would be if we hadn’t come in here.”

Touro University Nevada’s CEO and Senior Provost Shelley Berkley also said Qatar’s donation can help extend patient eligibility up to the age of 20 and hire an in-house paediatric neuropsychiatrist.

The move is part of Qatar’s donations to several partners and charities across the US in recognition of World Autism Day and Autism Awareness Month which included The Dan Marino Foundation Touro University Break the Barriers The Westview School Organization for Autism Research [OAR] and NEXT for AUTISM.

“We are committed to enhancing educational resources providing skills-based training and promoting programmes that boost independence for members of the autism community” said Qatar’s Ambassador to the United States Sheikh Meshal bin Hamad Al-Thani.

The gift will also open up more opportunities for charities and centres to conduct research on therapy methods for those with autism and disabilities in the US.

“The State of Qatar is proud to take a leading role in working with partners in the United States to ensure that individuals with autism spectrum disorder can lead full and meaningful lives” added Al-Thani.

Qatar’s embassy to the US is also a partner with Touro University Nevada whose Sharon Sigesmund Pierce and Stephen Pierce Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities was established in 2008.

April 2nd became recognised as World Autism Awareness Day after Sheikha Moza bint Nasser proposed it to the United Nations General Assembly in 2007.

The mayor was joined by leaders from Walgreens' parent company to kick off the new initiative aiming to vaccinate over 10000 people from more than 70 houses of worship in the next three weeks.

Clinics are taking place at four city churches Saturday including JLM Abundant Life Center in Garfield Park.

Miller lives in south suburban Riverdale but he said he was able to get an appointment at JLM Saturday after initially having some vaccine hesitancy.

""I wasn't really scared of that just wanted to see if any side effects would exist"" he said. ""(It's) worth the risk; I wanted to see mom. She's 86 and I'd do anything to take that.""

Now Mayor Lightfoot is imploring faith leaders to reach out to young congregants especially Black adults ages 18 to 39.

""That is the one group where we're not seeing the kind of uptick that we need for vaccine"" she said.

And the mayor once again stressed that these vaccines are safe as she thanked the people getting their shots for taking care of themselves and their families.

White non-Latinx residents have received a much higher percent of first doses compared to Black non-latinx residents in Chicago city data from as recently as March 30 show.

This disparity occurred even though all three groups make up roughly equal shares of the Chicago population according to the city.

The clinic runs until noon and is meant for church members and nearby residents so it is not open to the general public.",,,,,,,,,

This summer hundreds of McDonald’s eateries located inside Walmart stores across the US are slated to close because of sluggish business — a trend that was accelerated by the pandemic.

The decades-old partnership between the largest restaurant chain and largest retailer in the world has been fraying for years. There were about 1000 McDonald’s restaurants inside Walmart stores during their heyday but by 2020 there were half as many McDonald’s stores Walmart confirmed.

MCDONALD'S TO HIRE 25000 STAFF IN TEXAS THIS MONTH

In July McDonald’s said in its second quarter earnings report that it would be closing 200 restaurants in 2020 and that over half of them were at ""lower sales volume"" Walmart locations.

At the end of the summer just 150 McDonald’s stores will remain at Walmart the retailer confirmed.

The accelerated pace of store closures was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

McDonald’s does a significant amount of business via its drive-thrus — more so since the pandemic began — and Walmart lacks that option sources pointed out. Margins at McDonald’s Walmart locations have likewise been hit as ""customers at times loaded up on refills and condiments"" according to the Journal. Walmart also has largely stopped building new stores instead remodeling them which has created awkward situations according to the paper.

""You can’t do a multimillion-dollar remodel in a store and then have a 1980s McDonald’s at the front"" one source told the Journal.

Subway eateries are also pulling up stakes in Walmart stores according to the paper. The franchise is facing its own challenges as The Post has reported with stores closing across the country.

And so when it comes to inspiration for a recent video YouTuber President Chay and his brother Colby decide it's a good idea to spend a whole day walking a marathon. Inside a Walmart. That's right; they set out at 6 a.m. with the goal of walking 26.2 miles in the aisles of their local store.

Their aim is to complete all 26.2 miles in a maximum time of 11 hours and so they try their best to maintain a pace of around 2.5 to 3 miles per hour which would see them finishing the marathon in less than 9 hours. ""Our first mile was way too slow at 28 minutes"" Chay explains ""so we had to use this time to bump up our average speed to 2.5 miles per hour... the reality of what we're doing is really starting to sink in.""

After 6 hours of walking each take it in turns to stop for a lunch break and this is where the physical fatigue of the morning catches up to both of them. ""My knees are burnt toast"" says Colby while Chay finds himself unable to fully extend his right leg.

The challenge gets even more difficult as the day progresses the store gets busier and the soreness and tedium of doing non-stop laps of the store really begins to affect the brothers' morale.

A federal jury in Little Rock ruled that Walmart stole trade secrets from Agtech company Zest Labs a breach that came with a $115 million judgement.

The ruling against Walmart came after a two-week trial in U.S. District Judge James Moody’s court in Little Rock. This is believed to be the largest jury verdict ever in Arkansas.

San Jose California-based Zest Labs specializes in technology to reduce food waste and move food as quickly as possible from farm to table. In their suit Zest contended that while they were doing business with the Bentonville-based retail giant Walmart learned about Zest’s proprietary technology and stole it for themselves.

Little Rock attorney Scott Richardson teamed up with the Texas-based firm Williams Simons & Landis to represent Zest in the lawsuit. Zest Labs Inc. et. al. v Walmart Inc. was filed in August 2018 and the trial began March 29 2021.

Ecoark Holdings (parent company of Zest) released a statement explaining their decision to sue in August 2018:

In March 2018 Walmart publicly announced that after six months it had developed Eden to “keep track of food freshness all the way from the farms to our stores” and to “eliminate $2 billion in waste over the next five years.” “We were surprised and concerned by how similar Walmart’s Eden description was to Zest Fresh” said Peter Mehring CEO of Zest Labs. “Like most innovative companies we believe strongly in the need to protect our intellectual property recognizing the importance of preserving the value for our shareholders and customers. Zest Labs challenged long held beliefs at most retailers by properly identifying the primary contributing factor to pre-consumer waste. We then defined and implemented a breakthrough proactive approach to managing fresh food from the farm to the shelf significantly reducing that waste.”

Court documents show that on Friday April 9 the jury awarded $60 million to Zest for the charge that “Walmart misappropriated Zest Labs’ trade secret.” The jury awarded Zest another $50 million for exemplary (punitive) damages. For breaching the nondisclosure agreement the jury awarded Zest another $5 million.

After Friday’s verdict Randy May CEO of Ecoark Holdings Inc. had this to say:

“We are happy that we had our day in court and that the jury found that Walmart misappropriated our trade secrets and breached the agreement between the parties. The damages awarded were strongly supported by the evidence. The jury verdict also allows us to file motions seeking attorneys’ fees and costs. We do not believe Walmart has any basis to appeal the verdict and doing so will only confirm that the judgment was proper. Intellectual property is key to America’s modern economy. The jury understood that protecting trade secrets is the right thing to do and critical to future business operations in Arkansas. We plan to file an appeal of some of the Judge’s pre-trial rulings to make sure that Walmart is held fully accountable for its actions. The appeal will allow Ecoark and Zest to seek additional liability and damages findings against Walmart to ensure that innovative businesses are protected from misappropriation of their technologies.”

Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove sent this statement on the verdict which he says Walmart plans to appeal:

Zest Labs Inc. based in San Jose Calif. and its parent company Ecoark Holdings Inc. based in Rogers filed the lawsuit in 2018 in U.S. District Court in Little Rock saying that Walmart asked the company to test out its ""Zest Fresh"" freshness management system then stole the technology and used it to develop its own system.

The trial before U.S. District Judge James M. Moody Jr. was conducted under seal because of the volume of trade secrets and proprietary information that was discussed during the proceedings. The verdict was announced Friday afternoon.

The complaint said Walmart and Zest Labs -- which was then known as Intelliflex Corp. -- began discussions in early 2014 about possible solutions for an industrywide food waste problem -- known in the grocery industry as ""Fresh Food Shrink.""

In the original complaint Zest Labs said the company began development of Zest Fresh in 2010 and in early 2014 began talks with Walmart to analyze the retailer's food shrink problem which Zest Labs estimated totaled some $3 billion annually in food losses.

According to a Zest Labs presentation on its website Zest Fresh uses sensors to track perishable food shipments from farms and processors through the supply chain to the store shelves while relaying data that measures in real time the levels of freshness of any given shipment. It also uses predictive analytics to generate dynamic use-by dates on each pallet. By doing so the company said retail shrink can be reduced by more than half by helping to factor in the variables associated with perishable foods and giving retailers options in scheduling and routing.

On March 5 2014 the complaint said Zest Labs and Walmart entered into a confidentiality agreement and document of understanding.

In 2016 Walmart committed to a pilot program and deployment of the Zest Fresh technology which ran through April 2017 during which time the complaint said a large number of Walmart employees had direct access to Zest Labs' trade secret technology.

In November 2017 the complaint said Walmart abruptly canceled the agreement and four months later announced the Eden system which Zest Labs said ""looks sounds and functions very similarly"" to its product and was developed using proprietary technology and trade secrets that the retailer was privy to from 2014-17.

According to the interrogatories and verdict forms filed Friday in U.S. District Court the jury found that Walmart willfully and maliciously engaged in misappropriation of trade secrets violated the two companies' 2015 nondisclosure agreement and fraudulently induced the tech company into a statement of work that Walmart filed a counterclaim accusing Zest Labs of breaching. According to the court records that counterclaim was not upheld by the jury.

The jury awarded Zest Labs $60 million in compensatory damages $50 million in exemplary damages and $5 million for breach of the non-disclosure agreement.

Although the $115 million verdict is nowhere near the $2 billion in damages Zest Labs originally sought Randy May CEO of Ecoark Holdings said the company was satisfied with the verdict and that the damage award was supported by the evidence put on at trial.

""We believe this was one of the largest -- if not the largest -- awards against Walmart by a jury in Arkansas"" May said in an email in response to questions by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

Although Walmart was not specifically enjoined from continuing to use Zest Labs' technology May said the door was left open for further legal action from the company to discourage unlicensed use of its technology.

""We plan to file an appeal of some of the Judge's pre-trial rulings to make sure that Walmart is held fully accountable for its actions"" May said in the email. ""The appeal will allow Ecoark and Zest to seek additional liability and damages findings against Walmart to ensure that innovative businesses are protected from misappropriation of their technologies.""

He said the company plans to file post-trial motions seeking payment of attorneys' fees and court costs as well.

On Saturday a Walmart spokesman responded to a request for comment from the Democrat-Gazette with a prepared statement saying that the retailer plans to file post-trial motions of its own and is considering what steps it will take next.

""Walmart values its business relationships and respects the intellectual property rights of others"" said Randy Hargrove senior director of national media relations for Walmart in an email. ""We have policies in place to prevent the inappropriate use of third-party assets. We believe the jury's verdict is excessive not supported by the facts and should be set aside.""

May said that although Walmart could appeal the verdict he and his company do not believe a basis for a successful appeal exists.

""Doing so will only confirm that the judgment was proper"" he said. ""Intellectual property is key to America's modern economy. The jury understood that protecting trade secrets is the right thing to do and critical to future business operations in Arkansas.""

""Walmart may try to delay justice but we will continue to aggressively pursue this case and enforce our IP rights against Walmart and any other company that violates them."""

A Texas man wanting to raise awareness of diabetes just finished running from Disneyland in Southern California to Walt Disney World in Orlando Florida.

Don Muchow 59 started his goal of running across the United States in February 2020. He didn’t have a specific plan involving both Disney parks but Muchow told CNN affiliate WESH that after a conversation with a friend he decided to include them.

“He said “So I assume you’re running from Disneyland to Disney World?” And I actually hadn’t thought about it that way” he said.

Muchow started long-distance running to bring awareness to Type 1 diabetes a disease he has been living with since 1972 according to his website.

He hoped to finish the daunting feat by May but as we all know Covid-19 had other plans.

In March 2020 he had to put his run on hold due to the start of the pandemic according to his website. He picked it up again in Texas on September 24 and ran to the Texas/Arkansas border where he had to pause for a second time due to spikes in the virus in October.

He restarted his final push to finish on March 2 and made it to Disney World on April 5 a trip of more than 2500 miles.

“I’ve been on cloud nine ever since” Muchow told WESH.

According to the run’s designated Facebook page when he arrived at the park Disney security cast members and guests cheered and loaded him down with a custom Mickey Mouse cap balloons and more. He then was assigned an official photographer and guest relations representative who took them into the park to the front of his favorite ride – “It’s a Small World.”

Before leaving Muchow was granted his one request – a Mickey Mouse ice cream cone.

Two days later Muchow finally made it to the Atlantic Ocean completing his mission.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRldGhlbWFnaWMubmV0LzIwMjEvMDQvZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkLWFiYW5kb25lZC1haXJwb3J0LWFkMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Happened to Disney World's Abandoned Airport - Inside the Magic,"When you think of the word “abandoned” oftentimes you likely do not think “Disney”. That being said there have been many abandoned things on Disney property for quite a while.

From River Country Disney’s abandoned water park of 15+ years to half of Disney’s Pop Century Resort (which was abandoned until Disney’s Art of Animation was built) Disney has a past of building something and subsequently leaving it until they figure out what else to put in that spot.

Well it seems that we can now add “airport” to the list as there was a runway that ended up collecting dust for years until it was converted into a back road used for Cast Members to use for transporting various items.

Thanks to The Mouselets (@themouselets) on TikTok we can take a look at the abandoned history of this wannabe airport!

So when Walt wanted to create the original EPCOT — a community not a theme park — he wanted it to have a regional airport with four runways. That idea never came to fruition however and Lake Buena Vista Airport was built in 1971 to serve as a “STOL” airfield for Walt Disney World Guests and employees right next to Magic Kingdom!

There were only two airlines that used the shortened runway but by the 1980s the dream of having an airport on Disney World property once again began to die. With the construction of the monorail on either side of the airport it became dangerous to use the runway so no more flights were allowed in or out. Then by 2003 Disney World was declared a no-fly zone so the runway officially had no use.

Over time the runway was converted to a roadway but sat purposeless for years before any construction occurred. The demise of the airport is quite sad however because landing your plane on Disney property would have been magical for two reasons.

Guests would have the chance to fly over Disney World and get a bird’s eye view of the theme parks. When the plane landed to give Guests a little extra magic the runway featured a set of grooves like those on the side of a highway that played “When You Wish Upon a Star” when driven over at roughly 45 miles per hour.

Imagine landing to classic Disney music and then heading to Magic Kingdom and looking at Cinderella Castle which by the way you just saw an aerial view of? Doesn’t that sound like the perfect start to a Disney vacation?

I mean Disney’s solution to the Magical Express ending would have — at least in theory — been very easy if they did have a fully functioning airport but alas that will likely never happen again due to the restrictions and size needed on the property.

Would you prefer for Disney World to have an airport? Would you pay more to use it?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd2R3bnQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvcGhvdG9zLXdhbHQtZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkLWN1cnJlbnRseS11bmRlci1zZXZlcmUtdGh1bmRlcnN0b3JtLXdhcm5pbmctZGFuZ2Vyb3VzLXN0b3JtLWFsZXJ0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PHOTOS VIDEO: Walt Disney World Currently Under Severe Thunderstorm Warning Dangerous Storm Alert,"Walt Disney World continues to be battered by wind and rain this weekend. If you’re spending time in the parks or resort hotels this afternoon please be aware that the weather can rapidly deteriorate as we’re currently witnessing at Magic Kingdom.

Walt Disney World resides in both Orange County and Osceola County which are both currently under Thunderstorm Warnings as of approximately 12:30 PM.

The Dangerous Thunderstorm Alert has since been renewed as a thunderstorm in the area “has an increased potential to produce severe weather such as very frequent lightning heavy rain hail and/or damaging winds” as guests saw yesterday. We’re currently experiencing these effects at Magic Kingdom.

We were being rained on at the Magic Kingdom bus loop as guests wearing rain ponchos flocked to the busses.

The heavy rain was leaking through the roof as gutters are unable to hold the tremendous downpour.

Though we took these photos at midday the clouds made it look like evening and the lights around the bus loop came on. Watch our video below of these severe rains.

Outdoor attractions cavalcades and character appearances are currently paused at all four theme parks while the rain continues and the Severe Thunderstorm Warning is in place.

View the current offers here.

One constant of the pandemic has been a never-ending news stream from the wonderful world of Disney.

Parks closing parks re-opening (basically before any other travel or attraction) changes in the guest/park experience and now how the parks will deal with the pent-up demand of Disneyholics. It may sound crazy to head to a busy theme park in a pandemic but thanks to Disney's rules and procedures it's actually a pretty solid choice.

With my vaccinations complete I'm again headed to Orlando this July to meet a couple of other families for some solid Disney exploration and adventure. A trip to Disney World can easily cost thousands of dollars and can be a difficult trip to complete in its entirety on points and miles especially if you like to stay on Disney property.

But I love a good challenge. So here is a recap of how I'm covering the cost of travel tickets and food at Disney World using just my credit card reward points and perks.

Capital One Venture Miles for tickets and campsite

There are very few good options to get great value out of your points and miles for Disney tickets but Capital One Venture Miles from my Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card (currently available with a large limited-time welcome bonus) is a rare example where you can get the desired value out of your rewards.

With Capital One's ability to redeem miles to essentially wipe out travel charges you make to the card you can use Venture Miles to cover any travel expense charged to the card at a rate of one cent per mile. Since you earn 2x Venture Miles on all purchases this is equivalent to using a 2% cashback card to cover your Disney expenses.

For lodging I'll again be driving my RV down to Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground.

We stayed for a week last fall and found the campground to be such a fun Disney experience. It also happens to be the most affordable on-property location though still quite expensive as far as campgrounds go. The campground will cost me about $350 for three nights requiring me to use 35000 Venture Miles to erase the charge.

When it comes to park tickets there is one important note to make here: Disney tickets purchased directly from Disney by themselves do not count as travel and therefore cannot be erased. (They usually do when purchased as part of a larger lodging and ticket package.)

However Disney tickets bought from UndercoverTourist.com do traditionally count as a travel charge and you'll be able to erase the purchase with your Venture Miles.

For my dates this summer the three-day Disney Theme Park Base Ticket will cost $378.91 requiring me to redeem 37 891 Venture Miles to erase the charge. This puts the cost of my lodging and ticket at around 72000 Venture Miles and $0 out of pocket.

The Venture Rewards card currently comes with its highest-ever sign-up bonus: 100000 bonus miles after spending $20000 on the card within the first 12 months of account opening. This is awarded in two installments.

First you can still earn 50000 miles after you spend $3000 in purchases within the first three months of account opening. The second set of 50000 miles is awarded with a total of $20000 in spending in the first year on the card.

I recently picked up the Capital One Venture Rewards card for both my wife and me meaning with 200000 welcome bonus miles plus the miles earned to meet the minimum spend I'm happy redeeming 70000 of them to help make Disney free as far as my wallet is concerned.

Amex Platinum PayPal credits for Disney gift cards

At the start of January 2021 American Express unveiled a new temporary perk for The Platinum Card® from American Express cardmembers: an up to $30 monthly PayPal statement credit. Amex has automatically issued these monthly statement credits for eligible PayPal purchases that I've charged each month.

When I first heard about the PayPal credit I immediately thought of one of my favorite discount gift card websites that I know accepts PayPal: cardcash.com.

While I typically buy discounted gift cards from the site they also sell new gift cards for just about any amount including brand-new Disney gift cards you can order for exactly $30.

When you select checkout with PayPal a pop-up window will show you your linked cards including your personal Platinum Card from American Express which specifically tells you about the PayPal credit right on the pop-up:

Both my wife and I carry a personal Amex Platinum card and this is how I've been using each of our monthly credits.

With $60 in free-to-me Disney gift cards coming in every month by my July trip I'll have $360 in Disney gift cards saved up to cover food drinks and anything else I want to buy in the parks and on property.

Gas programs for free gas

I've written a couple of times about the self-admitted obsession I have with either not paying for gas or at the very least not paying anywhere close to full price for gas.

Whenever I have an RV trip coming up I begin to strategize about a month out how to earn enough credits in a variety of programs to cover the diesel I'll need to buy for the nine-hour drive to and from Orlando from my home in the Atlanta area.

Fuel Rewards GetUpside TruNow Pay with Gas Buddy Marathon's Make-it-Count Kroger Fuel Points and some targeted Amex offers can all make it incredibly cheap or free (depending on what promotions are occurring) for my summer drive to Orlando.

Bottom line

Through a combination of using Venture Miles earned from a sign-up bonus free Disney gift cards thanks to a new Amex Platinum monthly perk and a variety of programs that let you save on gas I should have my summer jaunt to Disney World be entirely free when it comes to cash required from my wallet.

There may likely be some unexpected cost of an RV part repair or something else unforeseen but as it stands I'm pleased with the different redemptions and strategy I have planned to cover my travel lodging tickets and food. Disney is always fun but it's that much more fun when the cost to me is $0.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhdWdoaW5ncGxhY2UuY29tL3cvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMS8wNC8xMS90b3VjaHN0b25lLWFuZC1iZXlvbmQtYS1oaXN0b3J5LW9mLWRpc25leXMtbWlzc2lvbi10by1tYXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Touchstone and Beyond: A History of Disney's “Mission to Mars” - LaughingPlace.com,"Disneyland is set to reopen in just a couple of weeks and what better way to prepare for Walt’s magic kingdom then to catch up with the big screen adaptation (of sorts) of the Disneyland attraction Mission to Mars.

The Plot

Mars 1 is about to launch and for the commander Luke (Don Cheadle) he is excited for this historic opportunity. Celebrating with his last night on Earth Luke is eager for the journey but regrets that Jim (Gary Sinise) is not the one going. For years Jim and his wife Maggie (Kim Delaney) prepared for this mission but with her untimely death Jim pulled himself out of the mission and now Luke is set to make history.

The launch and journey to Mars is a success. Luke and his crew are testing radar on an unknown object on Mars when tragedy strikes the astronauts. Three of the four members of the team are killed and Luke’s whereabouts are unknown. Jim Woody (Tim Robbins) Terri (Connie Nielsen) and Phil (Jerry O’Connell) prep a rescue mission to bring Luke home and to find out what happened on the surface of the red planet.

Their journey to Mars is dangerous and an engine explosion forces Jim Phil Woody and Terri to abandon ship and access the orbiting Recon ship. It takes Woody sacrificing himself so that the other three can reach the orbiting craft and for a moment success looks fleeting. Once they land safely the three find Luke in the Mars habitat. He cannot believe that they came for him and the isolation has caused Luke to doubt for a moment the reality of the reunion. Luke quickly fills them in on what has been happening on the fourth planet from the sun.

The unknown force that killed his crew comes from a sculpted statue face on the surface of Mars. Together they determine that the unknown radio frequency that the face is emitting is testing the astronauts for a response. When the crew realizes what the answer is they investigate the structure themselves. Phil is left behind in the escape craft while Terri Luke and Jim enter an unknown moment for humanity. Inside an all-white room is a being that will unlock the secrets of Earth and the cosmos.

Cinematic Compliments

I like movies about Mars so Mission to Mars had me at the title. The visuals used to create the alien landscape are fantastic and the technology seems realistic and not science fiction. I feel like the film used there NASA support well to present a realistic approach to how these missions would be conducted.

Cinematic Complaints

This film has multiple talented actors headlining the story but for the life of me none of them seem to be comfortable in their roles. While Tim Robbins shines as Woody his death negates the joy he brought to the screen. Gary Sinise is a talented actor who can pretty much do anything on the big screen but his Jim is a character that I just am not able to empathize with. I don’t dislike his character I just have no feeling for him.

Brian De Palma is a fantastic director but I feel like he was the wrong choice for this film. Gore Verbinski would have been a better choice. De Palma is too slow in his direction which makes the film drag and can cause the audience to lose interest in the story. There are moments of interest that hook the audience like the meteor shower that hits the rescue ship but the follow up to these dramatic moments are ridiculous. This billion dollar space ship that the astronauts fly doesn’t have a sophisticated computer that can identify where the leaks in the hull are? It takes Tim Robbins wandering around outside the ship and a leaking soft drink to find one of the leaks. Moreover as the astronauts are ready for their Mars insertion orbit the ship’s computer fails to identify a massive leak in the fuel lines which causes an explosion. How is that even possible.

The conclusion to the film is silly. There is no other way to describe the events that wrap up the movie. For one moment in a flashback scene we hear Maggie describe how Mars has a deeper connection to Earth then we know of which leads to this disorganized and preposterous conclusion.

Fun Film Facts

The film did not garner much love on the awards circuit. The only significant nomination that Mission to Mars earned was a Worst Director Razzie nomination for Brian De Palma.

earned was a Worst Director Razzie nomination for Brian De Palma. Gary Sinise’s son McCanna played the younger version of Sinise’s character.

Armin Mueller-Stahl has an uncredited role as Ray Beck the flight director for the mission.

The score for the film is by legendary composer Ennio Morricone.

The film is inspired by the Disneyland attraction Mission to Mars which opened in 1975 and closed in 1992. A duplicate of this attraction appeared in Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World and lasted from 1975-1993.

The Mars locale was built in a sandpit in Vancouver.

Multiple props from the film were on display at the Mission Space attraction in Epcot.

Gary Sinise was the original narrator for the Mission Space attraction in Epcot.

The timeline of the film takes place in 2020.

Mission to Mars had competition at the box office. In the fall of the same year another Mars themed film Red Planet  starring Val Kilmer and Carrie Ann Moss premiered in theatres. Neither were a commercial success or a critical darling.

had competition at the box office. In the fall of the same year another Mars themed film  starring Val Kilmer and Carrie Ann Moss premiered in theatres. Neither were a commercial success or a critical darling. Gore Verbinski was supposed to direct the film.

This is the second space themed film that Gary Sinise starred in. He won praise for his role in 1995’s Apollo 13.

The weightless scenes were filmed by hanging the actors from wires.

Mission to Mars is the last major film directed by Brian De Palma.

The Golden Popcorn Bucket Award

Mission to Mars gets a ½ Golden Popcorn Bucket rating. The film has a great cast but the story falls short and the conclusion to the film is silly.

A moving video of DMX explaining how to grow orchids has resurfaced in the wake of his death.

The rapper died on Friday aged 50 after suffering a heart attack his family announced in a statement.

He had been placed on life support days prior at a hospital in White Plains New York.

The news of DMX’s death was met with widespread tributes from fans as well as prominent figures in the music industry.

On social media many resurfaced a scene from a 2015 appearance by DMX in the ABC sitcom Fresh Off the Boat.

DMX played himself on episode nine of the show’s second season titled “We Done Son”.

At one point DMX tries to explain the key to romance to Eddie Huang (portrayed by Hudson Yang).

Turning to rows of blooming orchids DMX tells the boy: “When I first started growing orchids I thought they needed the most expensive soil and lights to blossom. They died.

“That’s when I realised that all they really needed was time and attention. You don’t need to get your girl a gift. You need to give her your time.”

The scene took on special meaning following the news of DMX’s death prompting people to reminisce about the moment in their tributes to the artist.

“This was such a pure moment. Today I’m thinking of DMX and his orchids” one person wrote on Twitter.

WM,Waste Management,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy52Y3N0YXIuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY29tbXVuaXRpZXMvY29uZWpvLXZhbGxleS8yMDIxLzA0LzExL2xvbmd0aW1lLXRob3VzYW5kLW9ha3MtdHJhc2gtaGF1bGVyLXRocmVhdGVucy1zdWUtY2l0eS83MTUxNTY5MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Longtime Thousand Oaks trash hauler threatens to sue city over deal with competitor,"Longtime Thousand Oaks trash hauler Waste Management is threatening to sue the city unless it rescinds a new garbage collection contract with competitor Athens Services within 30 days.

In a cease-and-desist letter Waste Management's attorneys sent the city Thursday the company argues the City Council improperly awarded the exclusive 15-year agreement to Athens at its March 9 meeting. The deal starts Jan. 1 and runs through 2036.

Waste Management contends the council violated the state's open meeting law the Brown Act by finding –without adequate notice to the public – that the awarding of the contract to Athens was exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act.

Simi Valley-based Waste Management notes the Brown Act requires a posted City Council agenda to include a description of each item at least 72 hours prior to a meeting.

But in this instance the proposed CEQA exemption was first made public in a memo from Public Works Director Cliff Finley posted on the city’s website only about 2 hours before the start of the March 9 meeting Waste Management says.

Finley recommended the CEQA exemption in part on grounds that since trash collection service is already being provided in the city by Waste Management and another longtime Thousand Oaks waste hauler E.J. Harrison & Sons awarding the agreement to Athens would not have a significantly different impact on the environment.

See related news others are reading:

Waste Management's letter states that by waiting until the day of the March 9 council meeting to post the proposed CEQA exemption the city violated ""one of the cornerstones of our nation ... participatory democracy in which constituents are fully informed and therefore enabled to meaningfully comment on elected officials’ proposed actions.""

In this case that ""eliminated any environmental review of the direct and indirect effects of the franchise agreement"" the letter states.

If the Athens contract is not rescinded within 30 days Waste Management will take ""legal action"" suing the city to invalidate the agreement the letter states.

But Doug Corcoran Waste Management's director of public sector services said Friday he hopes it doesn't come to that.

""Really what we hope is that they'll just do the right thing with it"" he said.

City Attorney Tracy Noonan said Friday she hadn't yet had a chance to review Waste Management's letter in detail.

""We just got it last night"" she said. ""But I will say I'm disappointed with this tactic. We have a long-standing relationship with them.""

Athens officials declined to comment Friday.

Waste Management and E.J. Harrison & Sons have had exclusive trash hauling agreements with the city in various forms since 1998.

Existing agreements with the two companies are scheduled to expire Dec. 31.

They and Athens submitted proposals for new agreements with the city to start Jan. 1 but at the March 9 meeting the council selected Athens exclusively citing the lower rates it offered.

For basic residential service Athens proposed $24.36 Harrison $33.54 and Waste Management $33.75.

For basic commercial service Athens proposed $174.99 Harrison $317 and Waste Management $290.34.

Households will save an average $150 annually under the agreement with Athens city officials say.

Switching to Athens will financially benefit the city too.

The city expects to get about $1.8 million annually in solid waste management fee revenue from Athens compared with just under $1 million it received from Harrison and Waste Management in 2019 the most recent year complete records are available said Helen Cox the city's sustainability division manager.

The extra income will enable the city to recover lost revenue and to among other things help pay to clean out storm drains and feed needy people Cox said.

I've always appreciated garbage men. And garbage women for that matter. Shoot for all I know the terms ""garbage man"" and ""garbage woman"" are considered offensive or derogatory to the people in that line of work. I don't mean to be insensitive or rude; I'm just not familiar with the people culture and terminology of waste management. My point is I appreciate the people and the work done faithfully week after week.

My appreciation however pales in comparison to that of an online account called Twin Cities Trash. With accounts on Youtube and Instagram Twin Cities Trash really strives to highlight the efforts of the men and women keeping Minnesota's streets clean. With some 900+ followers on Instagram and over 3.6k subscribers on Youtube it seems that Twin Cities Trash has a small but supportive following. Previous videos on Youtube include feature videos of different sanitation companies and trucks; one video even follows one garbage truck over the course of an hour from the perspective of a GoPro camera mounted near the ""loading hopper"" (see -- I'm learning things!).

While Twin Cities Trash's past videos have earned a fair number of views (anywhere between 3.4k and nearly 50k) the latest has really found some popularity online with nearly 425k views! Titled ""The Ultimate Minnesota Garbage Truck Compilation"" the account claims the video is its ""biggest work yet."" At 52 minutes long the video features around 75 waste management trucks from ""every corner of the metro area as well as some other areas around the state.""

I took some time to watch the video for myself (not in its entirety...I skipped around a bit). What struck me is the number of different types of garbage trucks; I really had no idea there were so many different types and methods for retrieving and dumping trash bins! It was actually quite fascinating to watch them at work!

I had an appreciation for waste management workers before but I definitely have a greater appreciation and admiration after watching them -- and their trucks -- at work! If you are a garbage-man or -woman thanks so much for the work you do!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwOTU5NjUyNjIxMDAyNTg00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Life-cycle assessment of treating slaughterhouse waste using anaerobic digestion systems,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652621002584 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwOTU5NjUyNjIxMDAyNTg00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb2x1bWJpYW1pc3NvdXJpYW4uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvaG93LWNvbHVtYmlhcy10cmFzaC1jb2xsZWN0aW9uLXN5c3RlbS1tZWFzdXJlcy11cC10by1vdGhlci1taXNzb3VyaS1jaXRpZXMvYXJ0aWNsZV9lMDMxMDY0NC05YTI2LTExZWItODZlZC1lN2U0NWQ0NmJhM2IuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Columbia's trash collection system measures up to other Missouri cities,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

Here's What You Need to Remember: In August the Russian United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) announced that the modernized Tu-95MSM strategic missile-carrying bomber was capable of carrying eight missiles instead of four while the aircraft also received new flight control navigation and communication systems.

""The flight lasted over eight hours"" a ministry spokesperson told Tass. ""At some sections of the route the strategic missile-carrying bombers were escorted by Su-35S fighters of the Aerospace Force.""

Such flights of the Tupolev bomber have become routine.

The bombers which are a key element of the air component of Russia's nuclear triad were upgraded to carry the latest X-101 cruise missiles. Those missiles can be retargeted once the bombers are already airborne.

Nearly Seven Decades:

The four-engine propeller plane was developed in the 1950s after Soviet planners had requested a four-engine bomber that could fly five thousand miles and hit targets across the United States. The choice of propeller-driven engines was made due to the fact that jet engines of the time burned through fuel too quickly.

The Tu-95 ""Bear"" remains one of the oldest designs in active service with the Russian military and the only propeller-powered bomber in service in the world.

Despite the age of the bomber it can still fly great distances and this year has made regular flights near American waters. While this most recent flight by the pair of Tu-95MS aircraft was closer to home the bombers had been making patrol flights near the waters of Alaska.

The aircraft has also been steadily upgraded and much like the United States Air Force's venerable B-52 Stratofortress it shows no signs of leaving service. The current backbone of the Russian strategic bomber force remains the Tu-95MS. What is notable about the Tu-95 is the fact that unlike the American B-52s many of the Tu-95s were actually produced in the 1980s.

This is because the older Tu-95 airframes were not suitable for modernization and in the late Cold War the Soviet military planners made the decision to restart the production lines to produce the Tu-95MS variants. As a result those aircraft – despite being an older design – could be considered relatively young when compared to some NATO aircraft.

The Tu-95MS's primary armament is the Kh-55 air-launched cruise missile (ALCM). The Kh-55 is a subsonic missile with a range of around 2500 km. The current fielded nuclear-armed missile is the Kh-55SM which increases the range of the Kh-55 to 3500 km. Its conventionally armed counterpart is the Kh-555 with a range of 2000 km. The Kh-555 has seen use in Syria fired from Tu-95MS. The regular Tu-95MS6 carries these six of these internally in a KMU-6-5 rotary launcher.

Still Flying High:

The Russian military has continued to enhance the abilities of the Tu-95MS with a further modernization effort the Tu-95MSM variant. The primary purpose of the Tu-95MSM modernization is to give the Tu-95MS the ability to fire the Kh-101 and Kh-102 cruise missiles that are carried by the newer Tu-160 bomber. Because of the increased length of the missile the Kh-10(X) cannot be carried on the internal rotary launcher of the Tu-95MS. As such the Tu-95MSM adds four additional external pylons which can carry two missiles each.

In August the Russian United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) announced that the modernized Tu-95MSM strategic missile-carrying bomber was capable of carrying eight missiles instead of four while the aircraft also received new flight control navigation and communication systems.

This past summer the Tu-95MSM performed its debut flight at the aerodrome of the Beriev Aircraft Plant in Taganrog and the improved Bear was piloted by the crew under the command of a test pilot Andrei Voropayev from the Zhukovskaya flight testing base which is a subsidiary of the Tupolev Aircraft Company. According to state media the flight proceeded in the normal mode at an altitude of nine thousand meters and lasted two hours and thirty-three minutes. The systems and equipment performed as expected and the entire test flight was conducted without a hitch.

With these recent upgrades the Bear is expected to remain in service with the Russian Air and Space Force until at least 2040.

Kelyn Spadoni 33 was taken into custody Wednesday on charges of theft valued over $25000 bank fraud and illegal transmission of monetary funds nola.com and WVUE-TV reported. The reports said she was fired by the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office after her arrest.

Spadoni is being held at the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center on a $50000 bond. It was unknown if she has an attorney who could speak on her behalf.

Spadoni is accused of immediately moving the funds to another account and using some of the money to buy a new car and a house authorities said.

Authorities said a clerical error had caused Charles Schwab a major financial services corporation to deposit more than $1.2 million into her brokerage account when it only meant to transfer about $82 in February nola.com reported. When the bank attempted to reclaim the money the request was rejected because the money was not available according to the sheriff's office.

The sheriff's office said it was later learned that Spadoni had moved the funds into another account.

Capt. Jason Rivarde a sheriff's spokesman said that although the money was put into her account ""it's not her money.""

""She has no legal claim to that money"" he added. ""Even if it was put in there by mistake. It was an accounting error.""

Charles Schwab & Co. sued Spadoni on Tuesday in federal court. The company tried to contact Spadoni several times to have the transferred funds returned but were unsuccessful Rivarde said. So far about 75% of the money has been recovered he added.

The company argued in its lawsuit that Spadoni's account contract with Schwab includes an agreement that if a client receives an overpayment of funds the client is required to return the full amount.

""If someone accidentally puts an extra zero on a utility payment they would want that money returned or credited to them. This is no different"" Rivarde said.

He said Spadoni had been with the sheriff's office 911 center for 4 and 1/2 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvY2FsMTAuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy8yMDIxLzA0LzEwL3BhbnRoZXJzLWFjcXVpcmUtZGVmZW5zZW1hbi1icmFuZG9uLW1vbnRvdXItZnJvbS1idWZmYWxvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Panthers acquire defenseman Brandon Montour from Buffalo,"Brandon Montour of the Buffalo Sabres skates against the Philadelphia Flyers in the first period at Wells Fargo Center on January 18 2021 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania.

SUNRISE Fla. – It was no secret that Bill Zito and the Florida Panthers were looking to bolster the team’s defensive ranks ahead of the NHL’s annual trade deadline.

On Saturday that idea became a reality as Florida acquired 26-year-old Brandon Montour (he turns 27 on Sunday) in exchange for a 2021 third-round pick.

The deal was first reported by Sportsnet 650′s Shane O’Brien.

“Brandon is a capable and talented right-shot defenseman who will have an immediate impact on our club” Panthers General Manager Bill Zito said in a release from the team.

Montour is playing in his fifth season after being selected in the second round of the 2014 NHL Draft by Anaheim.

He is currently playing on a one-year deal worth $3.85 million which means he’ll be an unrestricted free agent once the season ends.

Montour is a decent defender and solid shot-blocker with above-average offensive skills. He can help out on the power play and penalty kill if needed something he’s done through much of his career.

Good at getting shots through to the net and not afraid to skate with the puck Montour could fit in nicely with the style of play incorporated by Panthers Head Coach Joel Quenneville.

He’s logged 14 points (5-9-14) in 38 games with Buffalo this season.

“His two-way acumen and ability to play important minutes make him an exciting addition to the Panthers” Zito said.

On Thursday Florida acquired forward Lucas Wallmark and defenseman Lucas Carlsson from the Chicago Blackhawks for Brett Connolly Riley Stillman and Henrik Borgstrom.

Quenneville said Saturday that Wallmark and Carlsson are expected to join the team next week when the Panthers are in Tampa to wrap up their current road trip.

It is not known yet when Montour will join his new squad.

These units are expected to create 633 jobs for youths. These proposals are expected to get clearance from the single window clearance committe (SWCC) chaired by large and medium industries minister Jagadish Shettar by the end of April.Shettar told TOI that the government has already given nod to 16 pharmaceutical and drugs industries that are investing Rs 962.5 crore and will create 3000 jobs.“Now land has been allotted to seven more industries. Responding to our pro-industry measures 7-8 investors are coming forward every month to set up their units in the state. The proposed pharma park has also evoked interest among pharmaceutical companies of Hyderabad Mumbai and other cities. We visited Kadechur in January and reviewed the developments there. Many industries have already started construction” he shared.Karnataka Udyog Mitra managing director HM Revannagowda said that the seven proposals were cleared during the 83rd Land Audit Committee (LAC) meeting held on March 31 in Bengaluru. “Normally once they get cleared in LAC  there won’t be any hurdle to get the nod from SWCC. The next meeting of SWCC will be held in the third week of this month” he stated.Welcoming the move Kanthilal Dhoka vice-president Yadgir district Chamber of Commerce and Industry  noted that infrastructure development is very slow in Kadechur. “It should be expedited. Though some industries have started construction it requires 6-8 months more to launch production. This whole process is going on from 6-7 years but government should ensure starting production at the earliest” he underlined.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most notable of these have been Sangaku Yuugou and Chiaroscuro with Chiaroscuro having been completed back in 2008. After a long hiatus I completed Morphosis for the Cooler Master World Series 2019 and for the Cooler Master World Series 2020 contest which just announced winners in March 2021 I built something really special.

Meet Ikigai (生き甲斐) a Japanese concept meaning “a reason for being” my latest case mod project. The word refers to having a meaningful direction or purpose in life constituting the sense of one’s life being made worthwhile with actions (spontaneous and willing) taken towards achieving one’s ikigai resulting in satisfaction and sense of meaning to life. In other words It means I really enjoy building computer cases and I devoted four months of my life to bringing this case to fruition working most nights and weekends. It’s a passion project in every sense.

The case started as a simple concept like most of my cases. I wanted a vertical tower style case with less than 20 liters of volume that would take up little space on my desk one that is water cooled and combines my love of handmade wood joinery and Japanese design aesthetics. It also uses CNC machining techniques and integrates the water cooling and electrical systems. Like I said simple. I also wanted to keep the case open to show off every component making sure that every angle of the case was aesthetically pleasing.

Proof of Concept Models

Before I began my build I prototyped with some basic non-functional wooden models. While the models might not be functional they are to scale. I wanted to stay under 20L so I needed to be sure to make use of every mm of space. I decided on a central acrylic panel which would contain the watercooling distribution panel hide the cabling and allow the components to be attached. The top section would hold a SFX power supply and the back would have room for a 360mm radiator with full size fans to provide ample cooling power. I went through several iterations of these wood models because even though I was modeling in cad things change once you have the real hardware in the real world and it’s all part of my design process.

With some of the final components arriving I could mock up the case more accurately. Here I have the radiator and fan assembly in along with the motherboard and graphics card to check for clearances in the watercooling. This would all be hard piped PETG tubing and I was trying to avoid any surprises later on by planning ahead.

Wenge Dovetail Joints

After at least 3 practice mockup cases I finally had my final dimensions nailed down and it was time to start the final case design. I wanted a wood that was beautiful in its own right with a modern-looking grain that didn’t distract from the clean lines of the case design. I decided on Wenge as my wood of choice a very hard dense and brittle wood which seems to be a cross between charcoal and concrete. It was difficult to work with by hand but sharp tools plus perseverance made it happen.

Case Joinery

I started with the main mitered dovetails of the case by first making a practice joint out of cherry. By doing this I not only made a visual reference that I could use later to avoid confusion but I dusted off the mental cobwebs; it’s been a long time since I’ve done a joint like this.

I wanted the grain to flow around the case so I cut the entire frame out of one piece of wood matching the grain around the case as it went along. This also meant my joints would need to be good the first time around or the grain wouldn’t match up.

I used a dovetail guide by Lee Valley to make the dovetail cutting easier. Here I am cutting the tails first.

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

With the first side cut I transferred the lines to the next piece with a marking knife. By using the kerf of the joint as a guide I can be sure the knife marks will be exact.

Next I repeated this process to make the pins of the dovetail joint making sure I am cutting on the correct side of the line. A little pencil marking helps with this also.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Once all of the cuts were made I used a coping saw to remove the bulk of the waste. Then I used a guide block and chisels to creep up to my marking knife lines.

Once the main part of the joinery was done I cut the miters on all four corners with a crosscut handsaw.

To ensure the accuracy of the miters I made a guide block and used a chisel to sneak up on my lines ensuring a perfect 45 degree angle. Given how hard this wood was I had to resharpen my chisels multiple times for this to work well.

After quite a bit of time spent cleaning up the joints testing and refitting as I went while trying not to break them I ended up with tight fitting joints. This process took about two days and a lot of patience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vZWFydGhvYnNlcnZhdG9yeS5uYXNhLmdvdi9pbWFnZXMvMTQ4MTY1L3dlc3Rlcm4tbGFrZS10cmlv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Western Lake Trio,"While passing over California’s Central Valley an astronaut onboard the International Space Station looked east and shot this photograph of Lake Tahoe Walker Lake and Mono Lake. December snow cover accents the climatic transition between the colder higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada and the warmer lower valleys of the adjacent Great Basin desert.

Lake Tahoe the largest alpine lake in North America straddles the state line between California and Nevada. Tahoe is 501 meters (1645 feet) deep making it the second deepest lake in the United States (after Crater Lake in Oregon). This area while popular year-round is a major tourist attraction during the winter because the surrounding mountains make for great skiing and snow sports.

Located on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada. Mono Lake is an endorheic basin; it has no outflow so evaporation is the only natural way water leaves the system. Farther into the Great Basin lies Walker Lake. Fed by the Walker River to the north and by groundwater flow Walker Lake also has no natural outlet. With no outflow the lakes are rich in dissolved salts which leads to high pH and high salinity that can fluctuate depending on their respective water inflows. Some of the historical water levels of Mono Lake are marked by lighter “bathtub rings” around the shoreline that indicate where the lake surface once stood. Past shorelines are similarly visible around Walker Lake.

Perhaps most interesting about this photo is that all three lakes are different colors. This can be partially attributed to varying water depths but Mono Lake is unique. Because of high salinity levels and a dearth of fish brine shrimp call this lake home while feasting on algae. When the populations of shrimp are low the algae can thrive and turn the lake green.

Now the company sells internal external and portable storage drives and competes with giants like Micron Technology Western Digital (WD) and Samsung. Recently Seagate announced that it has shipped over 3 Zettabytes (ZB) of data storage products since its inception.

This is a significant milestone that the data storage giant achieved after operating for over 42 years. It crossed the 1 Zettabyte milestone back in 2014 which was 36 years after its inception. However the company reached the 2 zettabytes milestone only after 4 years. But here comes the most surprising number the company has announced that it has surpassed the 3 zettabyte milestone in March 2021. It took Seagate only 2 years to sell the next zettabyte of storage products.

How Much is 3ZB of Storage?

Now as you can tell 3ZB of storage is much more than you can ever imagine. To give you an idea you can store 1.5 quadrillion selfies or 30 billion 4K movies or 7.5 trillion MP3 songs in 3ZB of storage. However if you look at it from a macro level it is not that much storage!

A recent International Data Corporation (IDC) report estimated that the sum of global data generated by 2025 will exponentially accelerate to 175 zettabytes. This is 58 times more than the amount of data storage shipped by the company to date.

Besides with more and more “smart” things around us Seagate says that more data is being generated in a single hour than what was being generated in an entire year about 20 years ago. Today a single self-driving car produces up to 32 terabytes (TB) of data in a day and Seagate estimates that a smart city can generate up to 2.5 petabytes (PB) worth of day in one day. Well 3 zettabytes does not seem like a big number now does it?

Moreover as per IDC companies and enterprises on average only use 32% of the data for their day-to-day operations. The rest 68% data simply sits and hogs the digital storage space.

So to keep up with the rapid pace of data creation in today’s world Seagate states that it will continue to innovate storage solutions for clients and consumers. In addition the company claims to improve its open standards-based storage system and software and its Lyve edge-to-cloud mass storage platform. This aims to help companies and enterprises cut the cost and complications of managing data at scale.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NkYXkubmcvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL3NvdXRoLXdlc3QtZ3JvdXBzLWluLXByb2plY3QtYWdhaW5zdC1wb3ZlcnR5LXlvdXRoLXVuZW1wbG95bWVudC_SAWhodHRwczovL2J1c2luZXNzZGF5Lm5nL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9zb3V0aC13ZXN0LWdyb3Vwcy1pbi1wcm9qZWN0LWFnYWluc3QtcG92ZXJ0eS15b3V0aC11bmVtcGxveW1lbnQvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,South West groups in project against poverty youth unemployment,"In what the organisers described as a way of reviving the abandoned industrialisation policy of the late political sage and first premier of Western Nigeria Obafemi Awolowo for the Yoruba Nation the leadership of Yoruba Professionals Foundation (YPF) and Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO) have kick-started a project aimed at waging war against poverty youth unemployment and crimes through industrialisation and agriculture.

The project with the theme: ‘Promoting Knowledge-based Entrepreneurship in Yoruba Land’ was envisioned by a pan Yoruba Professional body YPF with the Banji Akintoye-led IOO as a major partner.

In December 2020 YPF and IOO trained 50 youths of Yoruba Descent on Smart Homes Automation and Solar Technology with capacity to compete anywhere in the world.

In January 2021 the groups also trained 40 youths of Yoruba descent including Kwara and Kogi States on several Accounting Technologies and Digital Marketing.

And in continuation of their drives against unemployment and the advancement of Knowledge-based Entrepreneurship in Western Nigeria the pan-Yoruba groups have just completed the training of 45 youths of Yoruba Descent on Advanced Paint Production and Application with the Trainees exposed to how to produce commercially over twenty (20) types of Paints.

The training done in partnership with an Indigenous Paint Company Comfort Paints Propman Ltd was on the production and application of Emulsion Paint Satin or Nylon Paint Texcoat Paint Screeding Putty Matt Paint Gloss or Oil Paint Flexcoat Paint Matte Eggshells Sheen Mamo Satin and Silk Paint.

Other paints the trainees were trained to produce included Flextured Paint POP Emulsion Paint Marble Effect Paint Marble Trowel Paint Base Coat Paint Graffitex Paint Anti Rust Paint Varnish Paint and Under Coat Paint.

Aside being trained on paint production the trainees were also introduced to a three-hour session on customers relations and management so as to aide their drive for business expansion and profit maximisation.

Speaking during the grand finale of the training and products exhibition session a retired Professor of Romantics and Comparative Literature Ade Kukoyi who represented the leader of IOO Banji Akintoye at the event said the programme as designed by the YPF is geared towards reviving the industrialisation policy of late Obafemi Awolowo in Western Nigeria.

In his words Kukoyi said “my generation is tired already so we are encouraging the younger generation to keep on with the battle. As you can see the Industrialisation plans of YPF are about Sciences Technology and Innovations.

“That was what Awolowo envisioned for Yoruba Nation and started for the Yoruba people before our “enemies” subjugated his vision but by the grace of God we are reviving everything and the journey to this redemption has started” Kukoyi said.

In his brief remarks the General Secretary of IOO Opeyemi Akinola said the organisation chose to partner YPF in order to ensure that Yoruba Land does not become another “South Sudan” after actualising its demand for Self-Determination within the Nigerian federation.

He called on the Trainees to ensure they join in the crusade for Self-Determination for Yoruba people saying the present 1999 constitution of Nigeria as severally amended will continue to sustain unemployment until it is repealed and the people are allowed to come up with the constitution they want as a country of many nations.

In his remarks the Founder and President of YPF Maxwell Adeleye said his team alongside other like-minds will increase the tempo of the Entrepreneurial Development Series being championed by the YPF in partnership with IOO and as supported by various individuals corporate institutions and organisations towards Promoting Knowledge-based Entrepreneurship in Yoruba Nation.

He said the level of hunger and poverty mostly caused by unemployment in western Nigeria is gargantuan and must be curtailed in line with the dictates of 21st century hence the decision to adopt a Knowledge-based approach.

“Hunger starvation and poverty breeds insecurity and civil unrest. And the major cause of hunger and poverty is unemployment. Therefore we want to use sciences technology and digital innovations to wage war against poverty in Yoruba Land hence we are here today.

“In our maiden edition at this venue in December 2020 we trained about 50 youths on Smart Homes Automation and Solar Technology. Today they are thriving. In January 2021 we trained 40 youths on various forms of Accounting Technology and Digital Marketing. The Trainees are now in town excelling.

“For almost one week we engaged our trainees on how to produce and apply paints over 20 paints. By the grace of God we shall monitor their progress and ensure they use their acquired skills to tackle unemployment in Yoruba Land” Adeleye said.

He thanked IOO other sponsors and everyone who contributed to the success of the training. He singled out the Legal and Finance Director of YPF Oladapo Kayode for his consistent dedication to duties and commitment towards the professional emancipation of the younger generation.

The resource person on paints production and application Samuel Adegboro Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Comfort Paints and his counterpart on customer relations and management Samuel Fasanmi a psychometrician and personality development expert charged the trainees to maximise the skills they acquired on the platter of gold towards a better life.

They warned the trainees against producing substandard products appealing to them to make integrity and quality service delivery their watchword as they begin a new life in the world of entrepreneurship.

Responding on behalf of his colleagues one of the trainees Hakeem Adebanjo thanked the leadership of IOO and YPF for giving him and his colleagues what he described as a “life-changing opportunity”.

“I never believed what I read online was real until I got here. I am a Yoruba man working for a living in Abia State South Eastern Nigeria; I had to travel down to be part of this free training worth more than a million. I am surprised and yet to believe that some Pan- Yoruba groups like YPF and IOO exists.

“On behalf of my colleagues we thank you for giving us a future. We thank you YPF and Ilana Omo Oodua for changing our lives. May history and posterity be kind to you” Adebanjo said",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlbnRvbmxpbmUuY28udWsvY2FudGVyYnVyeS9uZXdzL3JhaWx3YXktc3RhdGlvbi1jbG9zZWQtZHVlLXRvLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1pbmNpZGVudC0yNDUzOTkv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua2VudG9ubGluZS5jby51ay9jYW50ZXJidXJ5L25ld3MvYW1wL3JhaWx3YXktc3RhdGlvbi1jbG9zZWQtZHVlLXRvLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1pbmNpZGVudC0yNDUzOTkv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Railway station closed due to 'emergency incident',"Emergency services descended on a road near Canterbury West railway station due to an incident this evening.

Train operator Southeastern said the station was temporarily closed as well as the road leading to it while the situation was dealt with.

Emergency services are attending an incident which has shut Canterbury West railway station

It is understood police were called to St Stephens Road which led to the closure at Kingsmead roundabout preventing traffic from reaching Station Road West.

As a result its rail replacement bus services are being diverted instead to nearby Canterbury East station.

No details as to the nature of the incident have yet been revealed.

However the situation has now ended and the station has reopened although Southeastern said: ""There will be fewer buses than normal between Ashford and Canterbury West and Canterbury West and Ramsgate/Margate whilst we work to get things back to normal.""

Kent Police has been contacted for comment.

HOUSTON Texas -- A Houston woman who held the Guinness World Record for the longest fingernails on a pair of hands has had them cut after nearly 30 years.

Ayanna Williams considers herself a nail artist. In 2017 she was confirmed as the Guinness World Record holder. At the time each of her nails was at least 20 inches long. The nail on her thumb set a record at 26 inches.

Back then if you lined up all of her nails they would measure a total of 18 feet. She reportedly needed more than two bottles of polish and 20 hours to do a manicure. Along with her nails that task had grown in enormity as well.

According to Guinness World Records Williams had broken her own record with a new total of more than 24 feet before finally parting with her grand manicure last weekend.

After confirming their length a doctor in Fort Worth used an electric rotary tool to cut the famous nails.

Williams who hadn't cut her nails since the early 1990s told Guinness it was a bittersweet decision.

Her record-breaking nails are now immortalized with the updated record title and new display at Ripley's Believe It or Not! Orlando Odditorium.

""Even though it's just my nails it's going to be awesome"" Williams said. ""It's history for my kids and my grandkids. It's very exciting.""

She is encouraging the next history-making nail enthusiast to grow their nails and go for a title.

""Do what you want to do! Let everyone be themselves"" Williams said. ""If you want to grow your nails long do it!""

One of the most compelling events in our history was the Spirit Lake Massacre expedition from Fort Dodge in 1857. The Spirit Lake Massacre is an iconic Iowa historical event that took place between March 8 and March 12 1857. Following this horrific massacre was a heroic expedition of men from Fort Dodge who traveled to the Spirit Lake regions to provide assistance.

The first settler in Webster County in 1848 was Henry Lott. Known as a rather notorious character and swindler Lott had periodic run-ins with the local Indians over the selling of whiskey and stealing horses. Around 1854 after moving north into Humboldt County Lott and his grandson killed a Sioux Indian chief Sidominadotah and his family. Sidominadotah’s younger brother Inkpadutah became the new leader of the Red Top Bank of Sioux Indians and vowed revenge. Inkpadutah and his Sioux warriors turned their anger on the settlers around Lake Okoboji and Spirit Lake. The agitated warriors bludgeoned and decapitated 38 to 40 pioneer settlers; men women and children living in that region and took four young women captive. The warriors also plundered and burned the settler’s homes and slaughtered their livestock.

News of the massacre around Spirit Lake was brought to Fort Dodge by three men who had taken claims in the Spirit Lake region. The men were visiting their claims on March 15 and found the mutilated bodies of several men women and children. Realizing this was the work of the Indians they hastened back to Fort Dodge to carry the news and secure aid. They reached Fort Dodge on Saturday night March 21. The next day a public meeting was called in the “old brick” schoolhouse and the following day three companies of volunteers were organized by Maj. William Williams to go to the relief of the settlements at the Lakes region.

At the time Maj. William Williams was commissioned by the governor of Iowa to protect settlers from Indian attacks and harassment. Maj. Williams immediately began enrolling men from Fort Dodge; 80 men volunteered. The towns of Webster City and Homer also responded promptly and furnished 40 additional men. By the second morning the 25th day of March Williams had three companies organized consisting of 120 men. The mission of this battalion of volunteers under the command of Maj. William Williams was to track the hostile Indians remove them from the region and protect the settlers. They were also to bury the dead at the Lakes. On the morning of the 25th of March the companies began moving up the west branch of the Des Moines River heading for the Iowa Great Lakes region.

This brings me back to the present. On Jan. 12 I received a phone call from Patricia Woting of Rowlesburg West Virginia. Patricia introduced herself and said that she has never been to Iowa nor does she know anyone in her family that has ever lived in Iowa or been to Fort Dodge. Yet she had in her possession an original handwritten letter written in 1857 by a member of the Fort Dodge battalion of men who traveled to the Spirit Lake area.

The letter had been passed down from generation to generation in her family. In December 2020 Patricia’s mother passed away and going through old boxes that her mother had in storage Patricia came across this intriguing letter that was given to her mother by a relative who had previously passed away. Knowing nothing about Fort Dodge Iowa or the Spirit Lake Massacre Patricia searched the internet and found the History of Fort Dodge website. She then called to inform me about the letter and asked if we would like to have it in our possession and care. Without hesitation I responded with an enthusiastic “Yes!”

One week later I received a large Priority Mail envelope containing the historic letter preserved in a plastic binder. The beautifully handwritten letter was written by William F. Porter to his father. The letter offered a first-hand account of what he witnessed and the challenges that he and the other men experienced in traveling by foot to the Iowa Great Lakes area and then back to Fort Dodge 164 years ago. The letter conveys the gruesome carnage that the men witnessed and the incredible challenges they faced in accomplishing their humanitarian mission.

The winter in 1857 was one of the harshest recorded. The letter states how the men marched by foot up to the Spirit Lake region a 220-mile round-trip journey through blustery cold winds snow banks 3 to 15 feet deep and swollen streams. The challenges and hardships they faced were enormous and at times overwhelming. Every few miles the men had to cross streams marshes and bogs sometimes through chest deep water. They navigated through large snow banks and shoveled out paths so they could pull their wagons and the oxen through the snow drifts using large ropes and the strength of their backs arms and legs. Lacking food and other necessary provisions the men faced enormous fatigue and hunger while coping with the freezing cold as they were wet all day long and then slept on the open prairies at night without tents or any coverings. During the 17-day expedition two men froze to death and others lost fingers and toes due to frostbite. It was said that never were harder services rendered by men than those under Maj. Williams’ command.

It’s not very often that a piece of our history is preserved and presented to us 164 years later. The Fort Dodge Community Foundation is making an archival reproduction of this letter that will be framed for display so people can see and read a first-hand account of the courage and heroism of these men from Fort Dodge and the region. The Foundation is also consigning the original letter to the Webster County Historical Society for preservation.

Here is the original letter transcribed:

Fort Dodge Iowa 11th 1857

Dear Father

Our “Spirit Lake Expedition” has just returned to Fort Dodge after absence of something more than 20 days. I had designed to keep a journal of the trip and when I returned to send the details to some of the editors of the Westmoreland County for publication. But I refrain from the task and prefer waiting until an account is given to the people through the proper authority for I am sure were I to sit down and write the story of our adventures — it’s fearful scenes of trial hardship cold exposure peril hunger etc. and confining myself within the strictest bounds of truth and veracity — I say were I so to do it would be put down as the wildest exaggeration or the fevered imaginings of some crazy fanatic. Suffice it to say that we traveled the distance of two hundred miles on foot walking through swamps and sluices waist deep and over snow drifts from three to fifteen feet deep. We frequently were compelled to travel whole days with snow and ice covering our clothing to the hips and at night lie down on the cold prairie ground with no other covering to shelter us but the wagon covers and at other times no covering at all. Owing to the difficulty of obtaining food and carrying it when obtained we had frequently to march whole days with no other subsistence but a camp biscuit a few cold potatoes or a small piece of raw fat bacon. Our wagons we had frequently to carry or haul over the surface of the deep snow gorges by hand and by oxen and mule were also in like manner dragged over the snow by means of a long rope tied to their heads and legs. Those who are acquainted with the incidents of Col. Fremont’s Rocky mountain trip assert that this was attended with equally as much scenes of real suffering and hardship considering the short duration as was that of the Explorer. And such a scene of blood and butchery as presented itself to the astonished gaze within the limits and vicinity of Spirit Lake. Our men buried 29 persons consisting of men women and children murdered robbed scalped tomahawked cut up and slaughtered in the most inhuman mode of savage warfare- they buried all they could find during a very brief search but from the number of inhabitants living in that section of country who are killed and missing the number is supposed to reach 60 or 70 persons- some were lying on the ground with the head chopped off- others with the body chopped asunder from the hips to the shoulder- others half burnt- others deprived of legs arms? The whole scene presented a spectacle of cruel barbarity revenge murder rapine and bloodshed unparalleled by any of the darkest plots of the Revolutionary border warfare. To such a degree of cold fatigue and hunger were we exposed that two of our hardiest and most robust young men- residents of Fort Dodge froze to death. Though possessing but a frail constitution and unused from boyhood to such hardships yet I endured the trials with a better grace and come off with as few scars and blemishes as any of the crowd- though I would hesitate upon accepting five hundred dollars as compensation for another like expedition of trial and suffering – for I am sure no reasonable amount of money would compensate for frozen toes ears nose and hands.

For by the way my right hand is badly frozen which accounts for the present bad writing.

There will be a full account of the Expedition published in pamphlet form by Major Williams- the Commander-in Chief of the Battalion. As soon as it comes out I will send you a copy- it is designed to give in detail the most interesting incidents of the trip- also a list of the members of each company- their names and places of residents. There will be certificates of invoice issued to each member of the three companies vis A. B. & C. I was enrolled as I stated to you previously in Company A. As soon as convenient an application will be made to Congress by Major Williams for land warrants and soldiers pay for each member of the companies. We have dearly earned such remuneration- And if Uncle Sam don’t see fit to pay us- we will just consider he’s no gentleman. But I must just draw to a close for I am almost used up with hard work and harder fare. I’ll send you a copy of the Fort Dodge Sentinel containing a resolution of thanks tendered by us to our Captain and officers of Company A. Tell Obe to write me- I would write him but I feel so fatigued from the hardship that I will have to postpone it. Give my love and respects to all and believe me.

Former TNA X Division Champion Petey Williams made his return to the company during Saturday's Impact Hardcore Justice event.

Williams was the mystery partner for Josh Alexander. It was previously announced that Alexander TJP and X Division Champion Ace Austin would work the Triple Threat tag team match with partners of their choosing. Alexander chose Williams while TJP went with Fallah Bahh and Austin went with Madman Fulton.

The match opened the Hardcore Justice event and saw Williams and Alexander get the win.

This was a preview for the Impact Rebellion pay-per-view on April 25 which will feature a Triple Threat with Alexander vs. TJP vs. Austin with the X Division Title on the line.

This was Petey's first Impact appearance since late 2019/early 2020. There is no word yet on if Impact has future plans for the veteran talent but we will keep you updated.

Tournament buy-ins range from $300 to $1100 making the series enticing for players at multiple levels. Each tournament features a guaranteed prize pool up to $400000 and satellites are available for the biggest events.

The Wynn Signature Series begins April 26 and runs through May 9. The series kicks off with a $400 buy-in no-limit hold’em tournament at noon on the 26th. That event guarantees at least $100000 in prize money. Players can register for Day 1a and Day 1b (27th).

The Las Vegas poker scene is beginning to slowly return to normalcy and will likely get even closer come May 1 when Governor Steve Sisolak will permit local governments to determine COVID-19 restrictions going forward. Two Nevada counties — Washoe and Nye — have already announced they’ll eliminate most restrictions on May 1. Clark County home to Las Vegas hasn’t made any decisions known publicly. But many experts speculate changes are also coming for the state’s most populous county.

Las Vegas Poker Industry Booming Again

If you need any further proof of the growing Las Vegas poker industry look no further than the upcoming Wynn Signature Series. With $1 million at minimum up for grabs in 12 events it’s clear that the Strip casino is confident they’ll pack the house.

The Wynn poker room which is normally located within the Encore casino side of the resort has been temporarily stationed on the Wynn side since the card room reopened. But it will move back over to its permanent home at Encore in time for the upcoming series.

The series features four tournaments with six-figure guaranteed prize pools including the aforementioned opening event. At noon on the 29th the mega resort will spread a $250000 guaranteed no-limit hold’em tournament for a $600 entry fee. And then on May 3 the $400 buy-in hold’em event with a $100000 guaranteed prize pool begins.

The biggest event of the series which costs $1100 to enter begins on May 6 with the first of three Day 1 starting flights. At least $400000 will be split among those who cash.

If you’re looking for a non-NLH tournament the Wynn Spring Series offers $300 limit Omaha 8-or-better (April 29) $400 pot-limit Omaha (April 30) and $550 pot-limit Omaha bounty (May 6) events.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1jb2x1bW5zL2luc2lkZS1nYW1pbmcvbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXRvdXJpc20taW5kdXN0cnktaG9wZWZ1bC1hZnRlci1icnV0YWwtNHRoLXF1YXJ0ZXItMjMyNjYzMi_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV2aWV3am91cm5hbC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYnVzaW5lc3MtY29sdW1ucy9pbnNpZGUtZ2FtaW5nL2xhcy12ZWdhcy10b3VyaXNtLWluZHVzdHJ5LWhvcGVmdWwtYWZ0ZXItYnJ1dGFsLTR0aC1xdWFydGVyLTIzMjY2MzIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas tourism industry hopeful after brutal 4th quarter,"Executives of the Southern Nevada’s publicly traded gaming and tourism companies would just as soon forget about their fourth-quarter earnings reports.

Online poker play may be on the verge of a comeback in Nevada

Say hello to curling the next competitive sport in Las Vegas

Executives of the Southern Nevada’s publicly traded tourism companies would just as soon forget about their fourth-quarter earnings reports.

But they also have a lot to look forward to in future earnings seasons.

Just as government leaders and health-care professionals have asked the public to be patient about a return to normalcy so must the casino airline and gaming equipment manufacturing companies that represent the local tourism economy.

In the fourth quarter nine of the 21 public companies the Review-Journal business staff monitors reported fourth-quarter profits totaling $716.5 million.

The bad news was that the losses for the other 12 companies came in at an estimated $2.553 billion.

Frankly the first quarter of 2021 isn’t likely to be much to write home about either considering that capacity restrictions will remain in place through at least May 1.

With capacity restrictions still in place Southern Nevada resorts haven’t been able to generate much revenue in their casinos showrooms restaurants and other amenities.

Signs of resurgence

But look at what we have to look forward to in the second half of 2021.

It appears that after a rough start vaccination rates appear to be on track. While having the public receiving their full doses of Pfizer Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines won’t be a cure-all it should instill confidence in people to get back to what they enjoy doing in our resorts.

Casino companies have organized vaccination programs for their employees and even though some may believe they’ve been coerced into doing so by regulators the end result is the same: It’ll convince visitors from afar that Las Vegas is a safe place to go for a good time.

Last week sales representatives from the city’s major casino companies gathered in the Las Vegas Convention Center’s new $989 million West Hall for a panel discussion on the return of the convention business.

The gathering — properly socially distanced with attendees wearing facial coverings — was generally upbeat with journalists from meetings trade publications optimistic about the return of conventions and shows in Las Vegas.

Local elected officials and International Market Centers leaders held a Friday ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the grand opening of the new 315000-square-foot Expo at World Market Center in advance of the five-day Las Vegas Market show.

The event opening Sunday in downtown Las Vegas will be one of the initial events to return since the COVID-19 pandemic started more than a year ago.

In early June the first major trade show and expo — World of Concrete — will make its appearance which should generate some second-quarter revenue for several companies. Representatives of Wynn Resorts Ltd. Caesars Entertainment Inc. Las Vegas Sands Corp. and MGM Resorts International are saying their convention calendars are starting to fill up.

Panelists said their companies have been investing in their products during the time there have been fewer people in their buildings.

Trains planes and automobiles

Attendees of Global Meetings Industry Day were given tours of the new West Hall and media members also got their first look at Elon Musk’s underground people-mover transit system using Tesla electric cars. It’s an attraction that for now is unique to Las Vegas and could draw interest from tourists when The Boring Co. expands the system into the city.

And the recent announcement that Amtrak could return to Las Vegas is welcome news especially to those who have spent untold hours sitting in traffic on Interstate 15 between Southern California and Las Vegas.

Assuming that President Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan includes new side tracks for Amtrak trains to get around priority freight trains a Los Angeles-to-Las Vegas train route could take thousands of cars off the overused highway. Amtrak could also produce some competition for Brightline’s planned high-speed rail project between Southern California and Southern Nevada.

Planes are starting to fill up again as well which is more good news for the city’s resorts.

While first-quarter results for Southwest Airlines and Allegiant Travel Co. aren’t likely to be anything to write home about they’re bound to be a good starting point for the rest of 2021.

Southwest the busiest commercial air carrier at McCarran International Airport and Las Vegas Sands Corp. parent company of The Venetian and the Palazzo are due to be the first to share their earnings with investors toward the end of April.

Both had disappointing fourth quarters but both have expressed optimism in the months ahead.

Southwest’s planes are starting to fill up and the company has announced 17 new destinations including Fresno Palm Springs and Santa Barbara California. The airline also has ordered 100 Boeing 737 MAX jets and will retire the oldest jets in its fleet.

Meanwhile more and more restaurants and entertainment venues are starting to open up to larger crowds. It was announced late last week that the Electric Daisy Carnival will be conducted in May as planned. That huge electronic music festival will bring thousands of people from out of state to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway for three evenings of entertainment.

The only thing that could ruin everything is a setback in COVID-19 cases resulting from overconfident and overexuberent people who refuse to adhere to health guidelines on social distancing and wearing masks.

Investors in publicly traded gaming companies are counting on visitors doing the right thing so that we can all get back to normal.

They’ve continued to launch more and more podcasts during the last few months as well and their latest one involves a significant national figure in NFL Network’s Colleen Wolfe. Wolfe who has hosted everything from NFL Total Access to Good Morning Football: Weekend Edition to NFL GameDay Kickoff on NFLN will be hosting a new NFL Draft miniseries titled On The Clock With Colleen Wolfe for Blue Wire which will launch in April. She spoke to AA via email Wednesday about this and said she was interested in working with Blue Wire given the roster of talent they already had.

“Blue Wire really drew me in because of their roster of creators” Wolfe said. “They have so many talented strong voices across their network and I’m already an avid listener of their podcasts. I really respect their approach of investing in a diverse group of people and their full commitment to helping them grow and thrive in the current landscape. Blue Wire’s energy and support to build something unique and fun is ultimately what sold me. Their excitement was really contagious.”

As for the focus on the draft Wolfe said that’s long been an area of interest for her.

“One of my favorite times of the year is working the Scouting Combine and meeting the prospects. I really enjoy going on deep dives into their stories and discovering what motivates them. With no Combine this year a draft miniseries is my fix to introduce the NFL audience to the rookie class. We hear so much about the prospects’ physical attributes but not enough about their personality and character. I find myself really investing in the players I get to know and I don’t think I’m alone.”

Wolfe is long established in TV at this point but said she enjoyed the chance to explore podcasting for some of the differences that medium offers.

“I love the freedom to pivot and turn conversations in any direction on podcasts. TV and traditionally-structured shows have limitations to where and when you can go to unplanned places and those are often my favorite corners. The unexpected can be very entertaining and the freedom to dive down rabbit holes is like catnip. Sometimes it takes digging to really get someone to open up and when there’s time to really put in that work it’s so rewarding to have a very real and meaningful conversation.”

Wolfe said she hopes to make this a series that can really show off the personalities of these new NFL players.

“You can rely on this series to uncover the weird and wonderful things that make each player so unique. We’ll laugh we better not cry– but it’s not off the table– and we’ll make you smarter about the players you’ll be cheering for or against in the not-too-distant future.”

LOUIS – Marcus Foligno didn't play Friday night against the Blues but the veteran winger made the trip to St. Louis after being sidelined because of injury for the past month.

Foligno will be monitored to see if he can suit up Saturday when the Wild finishes off a back-to-back against the Blues before the three-game series shifts to St. Paul on Monday but coach Dean Evason felt Foligno just skating with the team Friday morning would provide a boost.

""His energy level his presence is a lift for the group regardless if he's playing"" Evason said of Foligno who has been out since taking a shot off the lower right leg on March 12. ""He just has that team mentality that team first that grit that bite that leads a hockey club.""

Different workload same approach

Kaapo Kahkonen's workload has eased up with Friday's start just his second over the past 10 games but the rookie goalie doesn't think his game has changed from earlier in the season when he was almost unbeatable while playing regularly.

""Be patient make the right reads and help the 'D' out as much as I can by talking or communicating playing the puck maybe"" he said. ""Yeah try to do the same thing that I always do.""

Power-play playmaker

Victor Rask is known for being the defensive anchor at 5-on-5 when he's skating with rookie Kirill Kaprizov and Mats Zuccarello a line that was reunited Wednesday when the Wild overwhelmed Colorado 8-3 before getting separated to start Friday's game against the Blues.

But on the power play Rask is emerging as a playmaker along the half-wall — helping set up three goals Wednesday including a redirect by Kaprizov off a stealthy feed by Rask.

""He wasn't on the power play at the start of the year and he wasn't likely playing as much as clearly he is now"" Evason said. ""He's taken charge of the opportunity that's presented to him.""

Milestone goal

Luke Johnson's first NHL goal Wednesday came in front of his family as his parents sister and brother were at Xcel Energy Center that night to witness the milestone in person.

""It was nice to have them down"" Johnson said.

Initially slotted in the lineup when the Wild's manpower took a hit from injury suspension and the NHL's COVID protocols Johnson has found a niche at center on the fourth line playing a seventh straight game Friday.

""He works hard"" Ryan Hartman said. ""He's got a great shot. I've been with him for a while; I was with him in Chicago. Not just on the ice but he works really hard off the ice. He's always on the bike always preparing for these nights. So pretty happy for him to get the first one.""

Boldy debuts

Wild prospect Matt Boldy made his pro debut Friday with Iowa in the AHL on a day where he was named an All-America. The forward turned pro last week leaving Boston College and signing a three-year entry-level contract with the Wild that kicked in immediately. He had a goal and an assist in his debut.

It’s no secret that major corporations rely on tax loopholes to reduce their tax bill and maximize total income. A new report by the Institute of Tax and Economic Policy says that in 2020 55 major companies paid $0 in federal income tax despite collectively earning over $40 billion.

See: Should the Minimum Wage Be $15? Take Our PollFind: Fortune 500 Companies That Haven’t Paid Federal Taxes Recently

Consumer Services Energy and Communications Lead Zero Income-Tax List

The 55 companies identified by the non-profit think tank are among some of the best known brands in the world. In the consumer services section alone companies like Charter Communications (the parent of Spectrum Internet) Dish Network FedEx HP and Nike all either paid $0 in taxes or received a refund.

Energy companies were also among the major sectors that did not pay into the community chest. American Electric Power Consolidated Edison Duke Energy FirstEnergy and Xcel Energy all had either a $0 bill or a negative effective tax rate. Other big brands on the list were motor vehicle conglomerate Penske Automotive Group software giant Salesforce.com and microchip manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices.

How are the companies able to get away without paying taxes? According to the report the decades-long trend was accelerated by the passage of the CARES Act in 2020. Although the bill provided economic stimulus payments to Americans it also allowed companies to “carry back” losses from up to five years to offset income usually taxed at 35%. This allowance created $500 million in tax breaks allowing at least four companies to get to a zero-balance on their tax bill.

Other companies used creative accounting to wipe away some of their tax liability. Over 10 used executive stock option breaks to reduce their tax bills by writing off stock-option-related expenses. At least six companies used federal research and experimentation credits to significantly cut down their tax bill.

Report Comes As Top 1% Called Out for Skipping Out on 36% of Unpaid Taxes

The ITEP report comes on the heels of another investigation suggesting that America’s highest earners are responsible for over one-third of unpaid taxes.

Pizza Hut South Africa recently added the KFC Chicken Pops Pizza to its menu.

Both Pizza Hut and KFC which belong to Yum! Brands are no strangers to experimental food offerings. The short-lived Double Down which replaced burger buns with deep-fried chicken breasts comes to mind. Pizza Hut’s chocolate-coated pizza base as a dessert was not to everyone’s taste.

The KFC Chicken Pops Pizza while new to South Africa has been around in the UK – and other parts of the globe – since February 2020. Pizza Hut introduced the unique pizza to South Africans at the end of March 2021.

BREAKING NEWS! Two of the world’s biggest fast-food brands have just joined forces to create something AMAZING! ???? Pizza Hut + KFC = The KFC Chicken Pops Pizza!!



Now available at Pizza Hut in all sizes all deals and all bases. Order online now at https://t.co/iezoqve7h9 pic.twitter.com/vHnD877Tcf — PizzaHutza (@PIZZAHUTSA) March 30 2021

It’s a simple enough formula. KFC chicken pops are sprinkled on Pizza Hut’s traditional thick crust base (although other crust and base options are available). A mix of mozzarella and cheddar cheese blanket the pizza and bring it all together.

In the UK version the pizza is dotted with sweetcorn and KFC’s famous gravy. This combination received mixed reactions. In South Africa the sweetcorn is replaced with tomato chunks and the gravy with “pizzanaise” which resembles KFC's tangy Finger Lickin' Good Sauce.

Here is what the pops pizza is like

Big chunks of tomato…. Everywhere.

Not-so-finely-diced tomato literally carpets the pizza. There is no standard tomato-paste base – instead the tomato carpet is accompanied by a weird ""pizzanaise"" sauce which resembles KFC’s Finger Lickin’ Good sauce. The result is an overabundance of tomato flavours which is overbearing.

The pops were kind of good – but rather spare and on the bland side

The KFC chicken pops are a welcome reprieve from the tomato flavours although you’d be lucky to find more than two per slice.

Those used to eating pops with a conventional sprinkle of fruit and chutney flavouring could find the ones on the pizza quite bland.

The base and crust are as they should be as is the cheese combo

Pizza Hut’s base and crust cannot be faulted. The heavy mozzarella-cheddar cheese combination compliments the chicken pops.

The verdict: Some things are best enjoyed separately

KFC recently ditched its age-old Finger Lickin' Good slogan – and associated sauce – due to the Covid-19 pandemic - the same firm standards of separation should have been applied to the KFC Chicken Pops Pizza.

A second tester described it as tasting like “a stale braai broodjie” (braai sandwich).

Pizza Hut popularised the pan-baked pizza with its distinctive crispy edge and thick cheese covering. KFC’s brand of southern fried chicken with “Original Recipe"" developed by colonel Sanders himself is especially popular in South Africa.

However the combination of the two does a disservice to fans of both brands.

The KFC Chicken Pops Pizza’s sells for R49.90 (for a small) R89.90 (for a medium) and R119.90 for a large (tradition pizza base). Prices may vary when ordering online.

If you’re really craving Pizza Hut and KFC our suggestion is to order a traditional margherita and a small sprinkle pops. To be enjoyed separately for roughly the same price.
