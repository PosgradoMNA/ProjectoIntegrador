Champion diver Dulanjan Fernando domiciled in Australia is keeping alive his dreams of representing Sri Lanka at the 2022 Commonwealth Games after winning a bronze medal at the 10-metre platform event at the Victorian State Open Championship last weekend.

Representing Mel Am Diving Club from Melbourne he competed in the 1m springboard and his favourite platform event.

“I am a little disappointed about my 1m event as I couldn’t get into finals” he said.

He came fourth in the preliminary round of the platform event held on the same day.

“I managed to do some couple of good dives in the preliminary round and didn’t expect to get into the finals from this platform event but I ended up becoming fourth in the preliminary round which means I qualified for platform finals. I knew I had a small chance of winning a medal and also I knew I need to nail every single dive to get that medal” he stated.

“I remember my coach telling me to visualise my dives before the finals which I did and it helped me a lot for my final dives. And I ended up becoming third in the platform event. My coach was so happy for me and it was a good competition and really good experience for me” said the 21-year-old former Royal College sports star who is studying for a degree in Sports Science at Deakin University in Melbourne.

Axed after being selected to represent Sri Lanka at the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games Dulanjan has reignited his dreams after competing in the 19-24 Men’s category at the Victorian Age National Championship in Melbourne. He won gold in the 1m and 3m springboard events to qualify for Australian Age National Championship in Queensland where he came fourth in the 3m and second in the 1m events. He also achieved personal bests of 278 points (3m) in Melbourne and 287 points (1m) in Queensland.

“It was really good competition for everyone because it was the qualifying competition for the Olympic Games this year. Many Australian professional divers participated in this competition and it was a good experience for me as well. Competing with Olympians is the best experience I had in my life because I met so many Australian professional divers” he stated in an interview with the Sunday Times.

“Unfortunately I couldn’t qualify for the Australian Nationals” said Dulanjan who won three silver medals in diving at the 2016 Singapore Invitation National Championship competing in the 17-22 age category and also a silver and bronze medal in the South Asian Championship held in Colombo.

He still has hopes of qualifying for the Australian Nationals though financial constraints may prevent his participation.

“There’s another qualifying competition in two weeks but I was thinking not to participate in that because I don’t have enough savings to spend that much money. Because in Melbourne when it comes to competition entry fees it’s a bit expensive. It’s like 120 dollars per event and total almost 400 dollars. So I’m going to focus on my next big competition which is in November in Gold Coast. I have enough time to save some money for that” said Dulanjan who was placed among the top eight at the 2016 Asian Championship in Tokyo in the 10m event.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NhbWVyaWNhc25vdy5jb20vY2FyaWJiZWFuLXNwb3J0cy10aGlzLWNhcmliYmVhbi1kaXZlci1pcy1nb2luZy10by10aGUtb2x5bXBpY3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caribbean Sports - This Caribbean Diver Is Going To The Summer Olympics,"By NAN Sports Editor

Not the figurative kind but a literal dream as she slept in the rental studio apartment in South Los Angeles that she was sharing with a friend.

The very next morning — she made an appointment with Mark Alston a local mortgage broker well known in South LA Black community to inquire about purchasing her very own home for the first time.

At around 2 a.m. Norrington remembers ""God said to me 'Why don't you get a mortgage that doesn't move?' And in my head I knew that meant a fixed mortgage.""

The story of housing discrimination is rooted in a long history of racist government policies perpetuated by the real estate industry and private attitudes that began with slavery. The federal government began to push and expand homeownership in the New Deal era through innovations like the 30-year mortgage.

Over the last 15 years Black homeownership has declined more dramatically than for any other racial or ethnic group in the United States. In 2019 the Black homeownership rate was about as low as in the 1960s when private race-based discrimination was legal.

Owning a home is an undeniable part of the American dream — and of American citizenship. It is also the key to building intergenerational wealth. But Norrington's homeownership success story is an increasingly rare one for Black Americans.

Today Norrington and her younger sister MaryJosephine Norrington own a three-bedroom house in Compton where three generations of her family currently live.

Alston has built his lending practice on the hope of expanding access to homeownership for Black Americans. He says they have been systematically discriminated against by the real estate industry and government policy. Unlike most loan officers Alston works with his clients for months — even years — to disentangle a convoluted loan application process pay off bills and boost credit scores so they can ultimately qualify for a home loan.

The West Coast has often held hope as a cultural and political promised land for marginalized groups. During the first and second Great Migrations millions of Black Americans moved west to escape the Jim Crow South in search of more equal treatment and opportunities — in part because legal racist policies and practices were so widespread all across the country at that time.

Today many of the same neighborhoods that were redlined continue not only to have the highest poverty rates but also worse health outcomes that lead to shorter lifespans. And Black Americans are nearly five times more likely to own a home in a formerly redlined neighborhood than in a greenlined or ""desirable"" neighborhood resulting in less home equity than white Americans have.

The vicious cycle and legacy of redlining has persisted: Residents of redlined communities struggled to receive loans to buy or renovate their homes which led to disrepair and a decline of a community's housing stock. That in turn forced businesses to close and depressed tax revenue diminishing school funding.

The Fair Housing Act of 1968 recognized segregationist practices like redlining to be unconstitutional. But the law only prohibited future formalized discrimination rather than undoing the foundationally racist landscape on which homeownership in America was built.

But one way Black people and other minority groups were left out systematically was through a process known as ""redlining"" which labeled certain areas as ""risky"" for a home loan. African Americans and immigrants were relegated to areas marked in red on government-sponsored maps where poverty was most concentrated and housing was deteriorating.

""That was Marvin Gaye's place right there"" says Rha Nickerson who grew up in the area as she points to one such two-story house on Gramercy Place.

Our story begins with one Los Angeles neighborhood known as Sugar Hill where the Black community successfully fought racially restrictive covenants only to later face another threat — from the freeway.

But while Los Angeles one of California's major metropolises would become the battleground for hard-fought civil rights victories for Black Americans it was also a place where housing segregation predatory real estate practices and exploitative lending thrived.

Rha Nickerson remembers her father teaching her about these covenants when she was a young girl and says that it was only because people like Hattie McDaniel fought these restrictions that her family was able to live there.

One of the most prevalent tools white residents used to maintain the segregation — across America and in Sugar Hill — was the racially restrictive covenant. These agreements embedded in property deeds made homeowners promise never to sell to African Americans or other minority groups. In 1940 80% of properties in Los Angeles had these restrictions attached to them.

But Sugar Hill's thriving Black community was an exception: It managed to exist despite systemic efforts to prevent Black people from buying homes in much of Los Angeles.

Siblings Rha and Van Nickerson are now 73 and 72 respectively. They spent formative years of their childhoods in this neighborhood which was once called Sugar Hill — a nod to the thriving Black Harlem Renaissance neighborhood of the same name. Doctors entrepreneurs and oil barons lived in Sugar Hill — even legendary stars like jazz singer Ethel Waters and Gone with the Wind actress Hattie McDaniel.

It's easy to tell from the ornate architecture of the houses the antique street lights and the wide roads that the neighborhood bore witness to a lot of history. But it's hard to miss the loud hum of the Santa Monica I-10 freeway coming from behind a large concrete wall at the end of Marvin Gaye's street.

Racially restrictive covenants were ubiquitous in Sugar Hill at the time like many places in America. But some white homeowners willingly violated them to sell to Black buyers in part because Black people were willing to pay more since there was far less property available to them. The willingness to violate covenants was especially the case around the Great Depression when many homeowners were desperate to sell.

The first African American known to purchase a home in Sugar Hill was entrepreneur Norman Houston who bought property in 1938. In the years following a wave of Black families moved into the area.

But one white homeowners association did not like the way its neighborhood was changing. So members of the West Adams Heights Improvement Association sued their Black neighbors for violating racially restrictive covenants in hopes of having them evicted — even though white sellers had violated the covenants.

McDaniel Houston and their neighbors fought back with their own Black homeowners association called the West Adams Heights Protective Association. Two of Houston's grandchildren Ivan Houston and Kathi Houston-Berryman say they remember their grandfather as a leader in the movement for housing justice for Black Angelenos.

""He always did have a vision and I think he was what is known as a pacesetter ... because he was always moving ahead"" Houston-Berryman says. Ivan still has his grandfather's notebook that documented the West Adams Heights Protective Association meeting minutes including the discussions the group had about fighting racially restrictive covenants.

After years of planning the parties involved with what came to be known as the ""Sugar Hill case"" took to the Los Angeles Superior Court on the morning of Dec. 5 1945. Hattie McDaniel her codefendants and 250 sympathizers ""appeared in all their finery and elegance.""

The white plaintiffs claimed Black homeowners in Sugar Hill would lead to declining property values in the neighborhood even though their Black neighbors had well-maintained properties with increasing home values. Such racist thinking was in line with the dominant logic of the real estate industry at the time — the logic underlying redlining.

In his retort civil rights attorney Loren Miller who represented the Black homeowners used an argument that had never worked in any U.S. court before — that restrictive covenants violated the California Constitution and the 14th Amendment which mandates equal protection under the law.

Taking the packed courtroom by surprise Judge Thurmond Clarke ruled in favor of Miller. ""Certainly there was no discrimination against the Negro race when it came to calling upon its members to die on the battlefields in defense of this country in the war just ended"" Clarke said.

This victory did not just mean the Black residents of Sugar Hill got to stay in their homes — it set a precedent for the 1948 U.S. Supreme Court Case Shelley v. Kraemer also argued by Miller that would deem racially restrictive covenants unenforceable.

Amina Hassan who has written a biography about Miller says the win was monumental because ""housing was the crux of it all."" She says access to safe quality housing meant Black people could ""have their children in better schools they could find jobs in the area. Housing was the key to greater wealth.""

In 1952 a few years after the Supreme Court ruling Rha and Van Nickerson's family moved into the Berkeley Square community of Sugar Hill. The siblings' eyes light up recounting their childhood there.

""We got our wagon and we'd go up and down the street and selling lemonades"" Van recalls. They share a laugh and Rha adds ""We learned how to drive in Berkeley Square because the streets there was no traffic. It was so comfortable then.""

But just months after the Nickersons moved in rumors began to spread that yet another threat to Sugar Hill was looming — a freeway. It was part of a federal push in the 1950s to modernize America's roadways and many of these highways ultimately cut through communities of color. The proposed plans called for the Santa Monica Freeway to run east to west razing Berkeley Square completely and splitting Sugar Hill in two.

""I remember quite vividly and I remember my father being so upset. ...I remember meetings with homeowners in Berkeley Square"" Rha Nickerson says. Some of those homeowners banded together and lobbied against the freeway at the state Capitol.

But this time all they were able to accomplish was delaying the project. The California Highway Commission unanimously approved the freeway that would decimate Rha and Van Nickerson's childhood home. Van remembers looking outside of his bedroom window. ""I watched the tractor bulldoze these homes down.""

The government seized the Nickersons' home through eminent domain — and while the U.S. Constitution requires ""just compensation"" for any property acquired this way residents who lost their homes were not entitled to assistance from the government in finding and moving to new homes.

Rha Nickerson felt her family was cheated. ""I remember my father telling me about eminent domain and how there was no option to stop this. The valuation for our home was quite low; it was not market value that we were compensated for. And so it was quite an upheaval.""

It was an upheaval Rha's father told her would never have happened if Sugar Hill were a white neighborhood. ""He was very very angry. He felt the city government resented Black people living there and this is their way of demolishing a very viable community to support racism"" she says.

At the time highway planners used the language of science to justify building freeways through communities of color says Eric Avila a professor of urban studies at UCLA. ""They presented a kind of dizzying array of charts and graphs to insist that this was the most economically efficient route for this particular freeway. They denied any questions of race they denied any questions of bias.""

What they did instead Avila says was say they were targeting so-called ""blighted"" communities. ""I don't think we know the extent to which Sugar Hill was designated a blighted area because it was affluent. ... But in the discourse of urban planning in the mid-20th century in the United States blight was often synonymous with people of color and with African Americans in particular.""

By 1963 the construction through Sugar Hill began and Rha and Van Nickerson's family home was replaced with traffic lanes. Around that time the California Division of Highways proposed another freeway that would cut through Beverly Hills. But when that wealthy white community protested officials canceled construction.

Almost 70 years later the Nickersons still feel the loss of their childhood home. ""It was just sad"" Rha Nickerson says. ""I didn't know what to expect because that's all I knew was Berkeley Square and I really felt very secure in the community. So I was quite rattled by it all."" She and her brother say that after the freeway forced them out they never quite experienced the same safety and comfort that Sugar Hill provided.

Van Nickerson recalls a particular moment when he knew things had changed. ""We moved over onto Bronson Avenue and I immediately got into some problems. Most of that neighborhood was white and a white boy called me a n***** in front of my house. And pardon my vernacular but I kicked his ass. You know that was the beginning of the real world for us.""

For many of the residents in the area today deafening road noise toxic pollutants and the resulting health conditions they cause are part of everyday life. This pattern has played out in cities all across America — affecting communities of color most.

Before Van and Rha Nickerson parted ways during a recent visit to their old neighborhood they closed their eyes and listened for the sounds of their beloved Berkeley Square one more time — only for Van to hear ""the rumbling of the automobile.""

""That was nonexistent when we were kids. It was quiet"" he said. Rha nodded in agreement adding ""You can't hear the birds anymore."" She headed to the corner to catch the next bus to Inglewood where she lives now.

Van got into his car to begin his journey home to a town more than an hour away. His drive would begin on the Santa Monica Freeway — and take him right through the middle of what was once known as Sugar Hill.

Blockbusting: How a predatory real estate practice changed the face of Compton

As the construction that made Los Angeles ""the city of freeways"" ramped up in the early 1960s white Americans continued to move to newly developed suburbs that dotted the borders of urban city centers.

It had been nearly a decade since racially restrictive covenants had been lifted so slowly more neighborhoods were opening up to Black residents like Robert Lee Johnson's family.

Johnson and his two brothers lived in a public housing complex in South LA until his mother Gaynelle became an X-ray technician and married his stepfather James Ferguson who was an aerospace engineer. In 1961 they bought property from a white couple just north of downtown Compton a suburb just south of downtown Los Angeles.

Johnson remembers moving-in day. ""I see moving vans trucks and everything all down the street"" he says. Johnson was 5 years old at the time so he says he thought ""it was moving day for everybody."" And he noticed that all the other families moving in were were Black too.

In the years before covenants had been deemed unconstitutional Compton was a nearly all-white city. Suddenly when covenants were lifted the real estate industry recognized a new untapped market could be targeted for home sales.

But for Black people to move in existing homeowners would have to make way. So the real estate industry targeted white homeowners to convince them to sell their homes using a scheme known as blockbusting.

The underlying idea was to create panic among white homebuyers by creating the expectation that Black homebuyers were moving in and would in turn lower property values in their neighborhoods. There are accounts of real estate agents recruiting Black people to walk around white neighborhoods with strollers to create the impression that African American families were settling in.

Agents would convince white homeowners that their houses were losing value by the day because of the looming threat of Black neighbors so the homeowners would panic and sell. Then the agents would turn around and sell those homes at inflated prices to Black buyers — who were eager to make a start in better neighborhoods.

Kitty Felde who is white grew up in Compton in the 1960s and remembers a flyer appearing under her family's front door. ""It had one very clear message and it was 'Sell now because you're never going to be able to get the money you want for your house.' And they didn't say this but it was like they are moving in.""

Felde says it was clear the flyers were referring to African Americans. In the years to come she began noticing the neighborhood changing and new faces at school. Her family chose to stay but many white neighbors fled and families like Robert Johnson's took their place.

Johnson has warm memories of the years that followed ""moving day"" in 1961. He says Compton felt like a ""step into another world"" compared with the public housing complex his family was living in prior to their move. Though their new home was shared with his brothers it was spacious. He recalls having fruit trees in his backyard — oranges loquats and persimmons. ""I didn't know what a loquat was until I got to Compton!""

He remembers going to a local recreation center and park to learn how to swim play basketball and perform in community Christmas plays. ""Our parents were involved you know. Your father was out there being a coach the mothers were out there supporting the team selling hot dogs."" He says it was a typical American suburb.

Until the mid-1960s Compton was a thriving Black city with Black political power — it had elected its first Black councilman Douglas Dollarhide who eventually went on to become the city's first Black mayor. Union jobs were opening up to Black workers and Compton was home to better integrated schools and a city college.

But while Compton represented social mobility for many Black Americans it also came to represent their exploitation. Predatory practices like blockbusting forced families to overpay for homes that would eventually decline in value as more Black residents arrived. According to census data the median home price in Compton in 1960 was $12800. Johnson's family paid $17500 — or 37% more — despite it being a smaller home than most in Compton at the time.

Josh Sides a professor of history at California State University Northridge says those numbers strongly suggest Johnson's family was a target of blockbusting. And after more Black residents moved in home prices languished in Compton over the next several generations.

""The really evil part of blockbusting in my view is that it perpetuated the notion that Black people in your neighborhood diminished value"" Sides says. ""And because of that perception it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. That is it became true that a Black person moving to your neighborhood meant your value declined because of course property values are largely the function of social decision and social beliefs.""

By 1970 Compton's Black population had reached 71%. But as more white residents left their businesses and tax base did too. A number of economic factors also led to fewer manufacturing jobs in the area which were the backbone of Compton's steady employment. Around this time industrial jobs had largely moved to LA's suburbs unemployment in Compton was skyrocketing and it continued to worsen into the next decade.

Johnson remembers some neighbors began having trouble making their mortgage payments. ""The first time I really noticed it personally was at school because you're sitting in class and your classmates are gone"" he says.

That's when he recognized something had changed. Wilson Park where he had had taken swim lessons and played basketball was suddenly without paid adult supervision which Johnson remembers resulting from a loss in the city's revenue.

""People in Compton were put in a very bad position"" he says. ""Legitimate jobs were gone and then comes this — it's more than a drug. It was almost like a demonic spirit."" He is referring to the crack epidemic that took hold in Compton during the 1980s.

Nearly three decades after his family had purchased his childhood home in Compton Johnson realized he didn't want to raise his own son in his beloved city.

""One day I'm sitting in front of my house washing my car and some fool from a block away had gotten a new rifle and he starts shooting out the street lights."" To protect his son Johnson felt he had no option but to leave Compton.

When Johnson's family sold their home in 1988 for $64000 it was worth less than what they paid in 1961. Adjusted for inflation that house lost nearly 8% of its value over 27 years.

But even though Johnson left Compton Compton never really left him. He's written a book about the city's history he's a founding member of the city's historical society and you can see his face brighten instantly when he spots an old neighbor during a recent visit.

A window of opportunity: Black flight from Compton to the Inland Empire

Robert Johnson was just one of thousands of Black Comptonites who began streaming out of the city in the 1980s in search of more space and safer neighborhoods. The face of the once majority Black city was changing quickly as its African American residents largely moved inland to newly built exurbs.

Billy Ross now 45 spent the 1980s and early '90s growing up in Compton just as Johnson was relocating his family. ""Compton was changing around us — and fast"" Ross says.

He describes his childhood there as both ""magical"" and ""incredibly challenging."" Magical because it was a largely Black city with political power which meant there was diversity within the Black community. ""It was a spectrum of people a spectrum of Black class ... you know from professional people to people [that] are just getting by. I mean that's magical.""

Ross' eyes crinkle and a smile spreads across his face when he recalls sitting on his front porch as his sister would braid his hair and a neighbor would walk past making spontaneous plans to play a game of dice around the corner. He says there was always something exciting happening on his block. But then his smile fades. ""The Compton I grew up in really doesn't exist anymore.""

But the ""incredibly challenging"" part of growing up in Compton he says came when the crack epidemic and its ripple effects hit. Economic inequality and police violence against Black people in Los Angeles were at a fever pitch. The rising tension between law enforcement and African Americans erupted in the 1992 uprising when four police officers were acquitted after brutally beating a Black man named Rodney King.

Ross' relatives and neighbors began trickling out of the city in search of more space good schools and safety. It was also becoming increasingly unaffordable to purchase property in Los Angeles County. Like many others Ross' relatives turned their gazes to the Inland Empire — a stretch of land that began about 50 miles east of LA. Not long before it had been mostly desert vineyards and factories.

But then a window of opportunity opened for potential Black homebuyers when newly developed cities like Rancho Cucamonga cropped up. Ross remembers visiting his relatives nearby. ""None of this existed. ... These houses were built like '06 '07 '08."" By the early 2000s so many from Compton had relocated to the Inland Empire that one of its neighborhoods became known as ""Little Compton.""

Ross recalls his impression of life in the Inland Empire as a teenager. ""It's like 'You guys are going to buy a five-bedroom house and you're going to have a pool. Like what? That's super fly ... and people were willing to commute for that."" Even though housing was cheaper and more spacious in the Inland Empire most jobs stayed in LA which meant commuters spent anywhere from three to five hours in rush-hour traffic per day.

Ross' parents chose to stay in Compton. Their philosophy was ""don't move improve."" That's a phrase Ross says Black people hear a lot. ""In the places where we are en masse there is often an incentive to leave and that's messed up because you don't get the generational the institutional cultural insulation. You don't get the transfer of energy. And you end up going from where you are rich in so many ways — maybe not financial — but you're rich. And you go elsewhere looking to carve out some economic security. But culturally now you are diluted.""

But even for Ross who holds such allegiance to Compton moving inland eventually became the most practical option. In 2000 after he had graduated college he married his wife Tamara who rented a home and then they briefly owned a condominium 25 miles northeast of Compton. A few years later when they learned they were expecting their first child they decided they needed more space and had new considerations like good school districts.

So in April 2006 the couple zeroed in on a four-bedroom house with a three-car garage in the city of Fontana in the Inland Empire. The entire lot was almost 8000 square feet. It would cost $525000.

Their loan officer offered them terms they could not refuse — something commonly known as a NINJA loan. They would have a minimal down payment — far lower than the standard 20% — and they would need no proof of income or assets. All the officer needed was a credit check which was no problem for the couple because they had high credit scores. It was so easy and they had been told they could always refinance if they needed a more affordable payment later down the line.

""There was this kind of feel that this is a secret and it's being brought to the masses now. That was even part of the pitch. ... You remember this feeling like 'Oh yeah this is like the kind of loan white people use.' You know like 'Why would you use your own money to buy a house?' ""

Immediately Ross threw himself into the pleasures of suburban life. ""The newness of it was cool. This was a one-story house and it had space inside and outside. And I could water my own grass like my father did. I had grass!"" Ross was transitioning into a real estate career at this time Tamara was climbing the ranks as a prosecutor and they were growing their family. Life in Fontana was good.

""And then by the fall of '07 all hell broke loose"" Ross says. The global financial crisis struck and suddenly the oasis that was the Inland Empire was beginning to disappear before his eyes. Nearly 16% of homes in the region went into foreclosure making it one of the hardest hit places in the country.

Many homeowners in the area sought help from the Fair Housing Council of Riverside County where Rose Mayes is the executive director. ""I had to create a whole new [foreclosure] department"" because of the high demand for this kind of help she says. The phone calls from those seeking help were incessant. ""They were experiencing pain"" Mayes says. ""They didn't know what to do. ... people who thought they had done the right thing for the right reasons and it didn't happen that way.""

Many people Mayes remembers helping were buying homes or refinancing for the first time making them more vulnerable to the predatory subprime loans that were widespread during this time. And she noticed that Black and Latinx people were most commonly targeted for such loans.

This is a pattern that has now been tracked all over the United States. Several studies have found that Black and Latinx borrowers were charged significantly more for mortgage loans than white borrowers with similar financial situations between 2004 and 2008.

A financial innovation called ""mortgage-securitization"" incentivized investors to sell as many loans as possible. Lenders would often steer homebuyers who could have qualified for conventional government mortgages into riskier loans that put more money in the lenders' pockets — telling buyers they could have a bigger house lower payments or both.

The people who were disproportionately targeted belonged to the same communities that had been redlined locked out of neighborhoods because of racially restrictive covenants and blockbusted. Now predatory loans would take away the wealth that so many had spent their lifetimes building.

By 2008 Ross says his house was worth half of what he paid for it two years earlier. But his mortgage payments didn't reflect that decreased value. He and his wife were paying two times what neighbors were paying to rent the homes along his street — many of them homes that had been foreclosed on by banks.

Homeownership did not shape up to be what Ross once thought — a promise to pass on wealth and security to his children.

Ross says he tried to refinance time and time again because what he was paying was becoming unsustainable. But the lenders refused — because ironically as long as he kept paying his mortgage every month they had no incentive to cut him a better deal. He thought "" 'Oh I know this game' and that was tough because you have made a commitment ... and the commitment is tied in a way to your identity. You see yourself as a certain type of person.""

But after paying what he says felt like an exorbitant mortgage for several years ""Tamara and I ultimately decided that these people don't give a damn about us. And they are content to bleed us dry.""

So they stopped paying. Ross knew their credit scores would tank and they would have to swallow that hit for years to come. But he also knew this strategy was the only chance they had to hold on to their house.

Eventually about two years after they employed a ""strategic default"" Billy and Tamara Ross' gamble worked. A lender finally agreed to help them refinance. They spent years building up their credit score again. In 2019 they were able to sell the house in Fontana and move into a new one nearby.

Mayes of the Fair Housing Council says many homeowners in the Inland Empire are still reeling from the financial crisis. Others she remembers helping simply disappeared she says.

Billy Ross considers himself one of the lucky few Black people who made it out despite a system he thinks is designed to keep African Americans on the bottom.

""It really makes me sad"" he says. ""There ain't a whole lot of us on this side where we're able to function and kind of take advantage of some of the things that this society has to offer. A lot of us we don't own property. We don't have equity in the stock market. We don't have equity in this country. We don't own stuff. And ownership is equity.""

That is why Ross isn't wasting his second chance. He and his wife have been building what Ross calls his soon-to-be ""forever home."" He recalls a recent conversation with a loan officer who was trying to lock him into a loan now — promising that if he didn't like the terms he could ""just refinance"" down the road.

It was all too familiar to Ross who thought "" 'This guy's asking me to gamble.' And I told him ... 'Dude I'm Black. ... We're going to measure twice and cut once. And we're probably going to keep this house forever whether we live in it or not. It's going to belong to our children.' ""

For Ross passing on that property is not just about leaving behind a house for his kids. It's about passing the baton to the next generation and the one after that — so that one day they have something to call their own.

Black homebuyers today pay an unequal price

A few months ago DonnaLee Norrington celebrated her 60th birthday in the newly purchased Compton home she and her sister MaryJosephine now call their own. Norrington thought she would never own a home again after losing the condominium she and her ex-husband briefly owned before the financial crisis. She said losing that home had turned her credit upside down and from that point on she rented.

""I didn't even consider homeownership just because I thought it was out of my grasp — not so much financially but just the fact that maybe I was too old to own a home and I just didn't want all the responsibility that came with it"" Norrington says.

Then she had that dream in which God told her to go to Mark Alston the mortgage broker to buy a home with a fixed mortgage. Alston says he understood Norrington's vision but ""she started crying before we closed. I told her to wait. Let's get all the way done before we celebrate.""

Alston says he got into real estate because he wanted to do something for his community — for people like Norrington — to change the persistent gap between Black and white homeownership. ""I mean it's pretty unbelievable to me [that] almost 75% of the white community owns houses. ... And in my community you know it's like 2 out of every 10 in LA 4 out of every 10 in the country"" he says.

Alston has mostly Black clients in and around LA. He says there are complex systemic barriers holding Black Americans back from homeownership many of them tied to the process of acquiring an affordable loan that actually allows them to retain and pass on generational wealth.

In order to simply qualify for a loan a potential borrower must be favorably ""creditworthy"" according to the lender. In the existing financial system it is the FICO credit score that primarily determines that creditworthiness but a third of Black Americans do not even have one.

And for those who do Alston says the scores are not as fair or predictive as they could be because the score does not factor in a wide range of payments ordinary people pay. For example cellphone bills utility bills and even rental payments are not included in the FICO scores lenders typically use.

Many financial experts agree that these kinds of payments are good indicators of one's ability to pay a monthly mortgage. Laurie Goodman of the Urban Institute told NPR ""I would assume that if you are looking at my credit score whether or not I make rental payments is far more predictive than whether or not I pay my Macy's credit card — but my Macy's credit card is included and rental payments are not.""

Alston says in the case of DonnaLee Norrington and her sister while they did qualify for decent loans with their existing credit situations a little bit of guidance in paying off bills and waiting for negative portions of their credit history to expire helped them get a better rate and eventually qualify for a refinance. ""A lot of people have disputes with credit over a $200 or $300 cable box bill"" which he says could significantly lower credit score.

Not all mortgage brokers help their clients dig through paperwork and small disputes to get a better loan. But Alston says most Americans lack an understanding of a complex financial system so this kind of guidance goes a long way. ""It has nothing to do with intelligence. It has to do with familiarity with financial operations"" he says.

Beyond credit scoring an additional barrier to homeownership became more prevalent after the financial crisis — risk-based pricing which essentially means the riskier the borrower the more a lender charges that borrower to loan them money.

About half of Black homebuyers get loans backed by the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which primarily use a borrower's credit score and down payment to measure the risk that will determine the cost of the loan. Because the average Black borrower's credit score is about 60 points lower than the average white borrower's score and because Black buyers on average make smaller down payments risk-based pricing tends to drive up costs for the average Black homebuyer.

Prior to the global financial crisis Fannie and Freddie used risk-based pricing to a limited degree but they generally enabled a broad spectrum of borrowers to access fairly similar rates on their loans. But in response to the crisis the mortgage giants got more aggressive with risk-based pricing — which disparately affects borrowers with less wealth and lower credit scores. Alston calls this ""the poor-pay-more fee.""

Economist Ed Golding worked at Freddie Mac during the crisis. Now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology he has analyzed how these extra charges affect Black homeowners' wealth. ""It's inherently unfair that basically we raised the prices during the financial crisis so that these people who were hurt by the financial crisis could bail out the financial institutions"" he says.

Golding says homebuyers with less wealth and lower credit scores are still being asked to pay more today. ""It seems that we're asking the victims to pay and to pay again for what was really not their fault"" he says.

In separate statements to NPR Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac said this type of pricing helps them manage risk and has ""provided stability during the pandemic and enabled homeownership for millions of families including many families of color.""

A third barrier to homeownership that disproportionately affects Black borrowers is mortgage insurance which is typically required if a borrower makes a down payment that is less than 20% of the loan amount. In fact 9 in 10 Black homebuyers pay for mortgage insurance compared to only 6 in 10 white homebuyers. And insurance is just another way the financial system accounts for risk — the cost of which is passed on to the ""risky"" homebuyer.

The Fair Housing Act does not consider any of these risk-based barriers to be illegal. Until now courts have ruled that lenders can price loans in ways that disproportionately disadvantage certain racial groups if that pricing is related to credit risk. But researchers at UC Berkeley have been exploring a fourth barrier that has nothing to do with credit risk: outright discrimination.

The researchers analyzed nearly 10 million home loans and found that Black and Latinx borrowers are still being charged more even after controlling for risk. That means Black and Latinx homebuyers with the same credit score and percent down payment as white homebuyers are still paying more for their loans despite posing no additional risk to the lender — which amounts to illegal discrimination based on past court rulings.

The study also found that the higher the concentration of Black or Latinx residents in a neighborhood the more Black or brown buyers in that neighborhood are overcharged.

""This effect is much more pronounced when we cut by geography"" says Robert Bartlett of Berkeley Law one of the authors of the study. ""And so it is a legitimate concern that basically this is kind of the new redlining that we're faced with.""

In this case rather than refusing to insure loans in Black and brown neighborhoods lenders simply appear to be charging marginally higher rates to people who live in those neighborhoods. And the effect holds true even when computer algorithms are writing the loans. Their findings will appear in a forthcoming issue of the Journal of Financial Economics.

This idea of including Black Americans in the housing market but charging them more to do so is part of what Princeton scholar Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor calls ""predatory inclusion.""

""Once you pay this fee that fee this higher amount of money now you get to participate equally with your white peers"" Taylor says. ""And so not only does that impact the way that housing is supposed to generate wealth for people — it cuts into the wealth the amount of money African Americans have to pay to enter into the housing market in the first place.""

The cumulative effects of these legal policies and discriminatory practices mean Black Americans pay more to own a home — what some experts call a ""Black tax"" on homeownership. It also means they accumulate less wealth over their lifetimes than white Americans — on the order of tens of thousands of dollars of lost savings and investments according to an analysis by MIT's Golding and his colleagues.

And while lenders and mortgage companies may say risk-based pricing is a fair way to account for risk the broker Mark Alston has a different view of what ""fair"" means in America. ""When you've had 350 years of not just unfairness but actual opposition — you had exclusionary zoning laws you had private covenants you had federally institutionalized redlining now you have disparate housing finance policy. When you have actual opposition 'fair' is an interesting concept.""

Alston says ""a good head start beats fast running"" and worries that a 350-year head start for white Americans could mean Black Americans may never catch up — unless the financial system is changed to be more affirmatively equitable.

""I could care less about Black Lives Matter being painted on [a] basketball court"" he says. ""How about an affirmative program to lower the gap between white and black homeownership? How about actual public policy that moves the needle for real? How about a change in employment and pay that narrows the gap the inequities between white and black pay? How about those type of things that will make a difference for future generations?""

In a statement to NPR the National Association of Realtors the largest real estate group in the country acknowledged its past role in housing discrimination and said it has implemented anti-bias training programs for its members.

""Decades of systemic racism have left millions of minority households behind a system NAR regrettably helped perpetuate a half century ago"" the group said. ""Over recent years NAR has recommitted itself to rectifying mistakes of the past dismantling lingering nationwide housing inequities and advocating for policies which ensure the market is more accessible in the years to come.""

Among his first executive orders President Biden in January directed the Department of Housing and Urban Development ""to take steps necessary to redress racially discriminatory federal housing policies.""

Alston plans to continue pushing for policy change that increases access to Black homeownership all the while enhancing access through his own practice for people like DonnaLee Norrington.

Back on her quiet tree-lined street in Compton Norrington sheds tears through a big smile as she reflects on her accomplishment. ""I always feel like a late bloomer"" she says but owning her own home is a relief.

""We don't ever have to worry about you know somebody gonna sell it from up under us or anything like that"" she says. ""We got our own little piece here. ... I feel really good about that you know leaving some sort of legacy.""

It's a legacy that remains out of reach for many Black Americans today.

Just over 33 per cent of people aged 18 across the UK have received both jabs.

The NHS hailed the figures as representing an “incredible milestone” down to “months of hard work”.

Vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi praised a “remarkable performance” from the vaccination team.

“Another remarkable performance by the team. Over two-thirds protected with one dose and now one third protected with two doses” he wrote on Twitter.

Dr Nikki Kanani medical director for primary care at NHS England said: “Yet another incredible NHS milestone has been reached as one in three adults in England have now had both doses of the Covid vaccine meaning that they have maximum protection from the virus.

“Reaching this milestone is no accident. It is down to months of hard work and everyone in the NHS who has played a role in this is helping to protect millions of people from serious illness and saving lives.”

Responding to the figures health secretary Matt Hancock thanked “everyone involved in our national effort”.

Both England and Northern Ireland are estimated to have fully vaccinated 33.6 per cent of adults. Scotland and Wales aren’t far behind on 33.1 and 33.4 per cent respectively.

Meanwhile more than two-thirds of adults in the UK have received their first vaccine dose. Wales has given 73 per cent of its adult population a first jab ahead of Northern Ireland (70 per cent) England (67 per cent) and Scotland (65 per cent).

Cabinet minister Michael Gove said that the “success of the UK vaccination programme” as well as the “good sense of the people of the United Kingdom” mean that the country is set to enter phase three of the prime minister’s roadmap out of lockdown on 17 May as planned.

Mr Gove told Sky’s Sophy Ridge programme that there’s “no indication” that lifting restrictions needs to be slowed down.

From 17 May indoor meetings in groups of up to six will be allowed including in pubs and restaurants and some international travel for leisure purposes will resume.

Community Work and Leadership Roles in Business School:

Awards : Dean’s List

Honors & Leadership : Student Body President of the Anderson Student Association (ASA) Co-President of the Jewish Business Student Association (JBSA) Forté Fellow Sandy Sigoloff Student Leadership Fellow Easton Center Technology Fellow Section-E President Anderson Ambassador Corps (AAC) Student Interviewer

Which academic or extracurricular achievement are you most proud of during business school? Stepping into my role as ASA President I was excited for a challenging dynamic and growth-oriented leadership experience alongside my 14-person cabinet. That being said no one could have known or expected the impending crisis and pandemic that would completely overthrow our student experience. Leading our 700+ full-time MBA students through the COVID crisis and acting as an ally advocate and strategic partner during a time of intense struggle and ambiguity has definitely been the extracurricular achievement I am most deeply proud of.

The past year has not been easy. I was elected to the position of ASA President two weeks before the COVID pandemic hit the U.S. When UCLA moved to remote learning in March 2020 we had no idea how long it would last or how serious the situation was. Students were anxious upset disappointed and scared and were looking for guidance and answers. Working alongside my cabinet and in partnership with the administration I am proud of the ways we have worked to maximize the student experience during the pandemic while working to ensure the safety health and security of our student body and maintaining morale. Since March 2020 we have helped our professors transition to remote learning facilitated a UCLA PPE drive worked with the administration to disburse stipends to financially insecure students advocated for international students around VISA and loan complications due to COVID launched a fully-virtual student storytelling platform called AnderStories to facilitate connection and vulnerability and developed the first-ever MBA Leaders Cohort bringing together executive leaders from across the top 20 MBA schools to strategize on how to improve student experience during the pandemic and beyond. As someone with a deep love of people and their stories I am particularly proud of our AnderStories program which has experienced immense success since its launch in December and will hopefully become a tradition at Anderson moving forward.

Though we have had our fair share of challenges and tribulations during this time committing my time and energy to protect and advocate for my business school peers during COVID as ASA President has helped me develop a deep love and appreciation for my fellow students and leaders. I truly believe we will emerge from this experience as stronger braver and kinder individuals and I am so proud of what we have accomplished together so far.

What achievement are you most proud of in your professional career? The professional achievement that I am most proud of from my career thus far is the work I did at Accenture on the Partnership for Refugees an initiative created to drive awareness and corporate support for the global refugee crisis. On June 30th 2016 President Obama announced a Call to Action to the private sector to make new measurable and significant commitments that will have a durable impact on refugees. In response the State Department and White House jointly launched the Partnership for Refugees initiative to facilitate meaningful corporate commitments to support refugee needs globally. Accenture was asked to serve as the strategic consulting partner for the initiative and I served on the small 4-person team charged with driving this initiative forward. In the lead up to President Obama’s Leaders’ Summit Accenture worked closely with USA for UNHCR the U.S. arm of the global UN agency to launch the Partnership for Refugees and facilitate corporate commitments in response to the Call to Action. After Nov 1st 2016 Accenture facilitated the transition of the Partnership to the Tent Foundation which now serves as the long-term home for the initiative.

Collectively working with both USA for UNHCR and the Tent Foundation our Accenture team helped secure 60 corporate commitments including investments and donations upward of $650+ million for refugees. In addition to the commitments our work and deliverables included a landscape analysis corporate playbook website operating model and robust corporate and NGO engagement. Moreover one of the most exciting parts of the project was the opportunity to travel to the White House in D.C. and help facilitate a Partnership for Refugees event which convened 24 corporate partners and a number of key NGO and UN leaders for a set of impact area focused breakout sessions facilitated by our Accenture team. Walking through the halls of the White House with a worthy mission and purpose to protect and serve refugees was one of the most memorable moments of my career thus far especially during the tumultuous political transition of 2016. This work was further meaningful to me personally as the granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor given that my grandfather was once a refugee to this country many years ago after escaping the concentration camps during World War II.

Why did you choose this business school? People choose to go to business school for many reasons – career growth networking recruiting social life and more. For me personally I came to business school with an intense desire to strengthen my leadership skills and capabilities. I wanted to challenge myself to grow evolve and improve as a leader both in a personal and professional sense. There is no better place to grow as a leader than UCLA Anderson and this became very clear to me after visiting campus and talking to current student leaders.

Anderson is an extremely student-led program and gives its leaders immense opportunity to create change and make an impact. Our Anderson Student Association (ASA) oversees our club ecosystem and council of 70+ club presidents operates its own budget manages its own elections plans school-wide social events and executes new strategic initiatives and programming. On top of that our students fully lead our clubs and play an active role in recruiting preparation for first years with second year students leading interview prep training sessions and facilitating industry career seminars for their peers. At Anderson second year students are even a part of the admissions process acting as student interviewers who help select our next class of MBAs. The administration at Anderson truly empowers its students with the tools resources and independence to lead and create change and I think that is extremely valuable and unique. Looking back on my Anderson experience I am particularly grateful for the leadership opportunities I have been given and believe that I have grown more through those positions than any other aspect of my MBA experience.

Who was your favorite MBA professor? My favorite professor at Anderson is Ian Larkin who taught General Management in my second year. Professor Larkin has a unique ability to facilitate robust and thoughtful case discussions that have deep applications to real life and focus not only on business outcomes but also on values and ethics. He challenges students to simulate tough real-life conversations in our class discussions as a means to facilitate tangible learnings even if uncomfortable in the moment. In addition to having an impressive career you can tell that Professor Larkin is extremely passionate about helping people be the best versions of themselves and giving people the tools to be strong values-driven and strategic business leaders. Moreover Professor Larkin has impressed me in other more understated ways such as his intentional effort to incorporate female pronouns when discussing C-suite leaders in class. This small gesture goes a long way to creating a culture of equity and inclusivity in the business school environment.

What was your favorite MBA event or tradition at your business school? My favorite Anderson tradition is a newly founded one — our annual AnderCup competition a year-long competition across sections that includes sports talent shows culinary skills fundraising and volunteering and more. During COVID our AnderCup turned into QuaranCup and we ran two supremely successful weekends full of virtual competitions including a bake-off tipsy spelling bee pet talent show FIFA competition and more. All the while we nurture section pride and increase our volunteering hours and funds raised for our core charities. It is a win-win for everyone!

What is the biggest myth about your school? That we’re a bunch of bros looking to work in consulting or banking. In reality we have such a robust and diverse community that pursues so many different career paths including but not limited to technology entertainment CPG social impact real estate and more.

What is one thing you did during the application process that gave you an edge at the school you chose? Anderson is not only an MBA program but a very close-knit community. One of our core pillars “Share Success” truly runs through the veins of our institution. Being an Anderson student doesn’t mean coming to school each day thinking about yourself but rather thinking about the ways you can serve and better the lives of others. Therefore a strong desire to give back to the Anderson community is a key value that we look for in prospective students. Doing robust research and speaking to current students and alumni throughout my application process helped me identify the particular areas of the Anderson community that I was excited to invest myself in and give back to and allowed me to brainstorm ideas for tangible ways I wanted to make a difference at Anderson. I believe that exhibiting a genuine passion for giving back and having really detailed responses to those questions in my interview helped me stand out in the overall recruiting process.

Which MBA classmate do you most admire? A classmate of mine that I admire and respect deeply is Parth Chauhan. A fellow second-year Parth has been the epitome of a team player go getter and overall positive life force for our community especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. I believe Parth is one of the most involved and impactful student leaders on campus. He serves as the VP of Social on the ASA Cabinet as Co-President of our Anderson Onboarding Committee as the President of our Anderson Comedy Club and the VP of Challenge for Charity (amongst other significant roles in entertainment and entrepreneurship as well). When not in class or at Ruben’s Taco Truck Parth spends his time creatively planning social events for our whole student body executing incredible and much-needed comedy events co-planning our AnderCup competition executing amazing onboarding programming for new students and more. Having worked with him on the ASA cabinet I know firsthand the amount of passion and drive Parth exhibits for bettering the experience of his peers. He is always the first to volunteer for any task and does so with a smile positive attitude and humility. He is a goofball who loves to make people laugh and has the enviable ability to just truly be himself and be loved for it. He has devoted 110% of himself to his fellow students this year and I am truly honored and inspired to know him and work alongside him. I know he’s going to make it far in life and I can’t wait to see all the smiles and laughs he brings along his ride to success. Thank you Parth for everything you do!

How disruptive was it to shift to an online or hybrid environment after COVID hit? COVID definitely disrupted our learning environment like it did for everyone else. Classes and club events all moved to Zoom global immersion and capstone trips were canceled and the student community dispersed as quarantines took effect and some students traveled home to be alongside their loved ones. It was definitely an abrupt shift in March 2020 but through the combined efforts of the administration student leaders and clubs we have been able to continue learning growing and having fun albeit in slightly different ways. This includes events like virtual career nights that leveraged unique interactive software to create a robust virtual experience virtual wine tastings and paint nights facilitated by our wine club in partnership with local businesses and even our virtual AnderCup competition. Though it is obviously not the same the pandemic has forced us to think creatively and collaborate closely to salvage as much of the experience as we can for our student community.

Who most influenced your decision to pursue business in college? As a college student I studied economics and political science as a means to better understand the world around me how it operated and my place within it. Since I didn’t want to become an economist or politician I looked for the next best path to channel my learnings and skills ultimately landing in consulting at Accenture. I would say that my most recent team members at Accenture and the work we did together helped influence my desire to pursue my MBA. My most recent project was with the Mayor’s Office of New York. Here I helped design and implement a custom software solution to transform NYC procurement saving the city money and driving efficiency but also improving their support of small and minority-owned businesses and driving adherence to policy and equity in the procurement process. Working alongside my team to execute these tangible changes inspired my love for building transformative tech products and my desire to go to business school so I could pivot into product management at a mission-driven company. I credit my manager Kevin my client lead Brandon and my Accenture team members for helping me uncover this passion and desire to grow my product career with an MBA.

What are the top two items on your professional bucket list?

My ultimate goal is to become a product and thought leader at an impact-driven organization. I would love to be able to channel my skills and experiences in technology to drive change in key impact areas I am passionate about such as healthcare education and economic development. For four years when I lived in NYC I volunteered as a lead dance instructor for a nonprofit called House of the Roses (HOTR) which brings dance and movement workshops to kids living in homeless shelters. Leveraging my love for dance to empower and embolden the kids who need it most continues to be a highlight of my life so far. Right now HOTR only operates in New York City. In the future I would love to help the nonprofit execute a local chapter of HOTR in Los Angeles and leverage the city’s robust network of dancers and creators to bring positive change to the many kids living in homeless shelters across the city.

“Helping run our fulltime MBA program during a pandemic has meant that I’ve worked more closely with Shoshana than I have with any previous Anderson Student Association leader. So closely in fact that we recently found ourselves laughing about the fact that her impending transition out of her leadership role feels like we’re both losing a coworker! This is a testament to how Shoshana has risen to the occasion and challenged herself to lead in new ways in a very uncertain landscape. Other students might have been overwhelmed by the impact of COVID and felt that what was now required of them wasn’t what they signed up for. Shoshana didn’t flinch for an instant. She has worked with the administration hand in hand week after week since March of 2020 to ensure that the Anderson community continues to thrive even while we have been 100% remote for an entire year.

This sometimes meant that Shoshana had to tell us things that were hard for us to hear. We had to adjust to brand new ways of operating and we didn’t always get it immediately right. Shoshana was the voice urging us to communicate more often and more transparently with students even when the answers to questions were “We don’t know yet.” She did this with tact and respect trusting our commitment and navigating tough subjects deftly in ways that her peers could not.

Some days I would see Shoshana at an 8 a.m. meeting with our Dean and then again at an evening meeting with our first-year section presidents. She was always present engaged listening and asking the right questions. Even in the hardest moments of the pandemic when student tensions were running high she didn’t falter. She jumped onto last-minute Zoom sessions with us and talked things through from every possible angle until we found the solutions that felt right.

Throughout all of this she maintained her other leadership commitments and a dedication to her studies. Shoshana has always been very intentional about her academics meeting with me every quarter to thoroughly explore her options. While other students ask me “what’s popular” Shoshana took the time to fully consider what she wanted to learn while in business school and made sure she was pointed in the right direction. Her ability to stay true to her own goals and priorities in the face of lots of herd thinking has always impressed me.

Shoshana had enough on her plate keeping up with the demands of being a student leader during COVID and she could have stopped there. But she was committed to also adding new value to the Anderson experience. She made it her mission to develop AnderStories a safe space for students to talk about themselves and their personal experiences behind the mask of perfection that many in business school feel is expected of them. This has created an opportunity for people to be their real vulnerable selves at a time when they perhaps needed that the most.”

By D.N. Vasuki

Industry has entered the education sector.” What does this mean for us academicians and educationists? The issues I have discussed in this article is a result of changing education scenario at all premium institutions like IITs IIMs NITs and some leading Universities in India who are gearing up to realign with changing “in-demand digital fluency” expectations from the industry.

“Being digital used to be an aspiration now it is imperative for survival.” — Accenture

What does this mean for us? How can technical institutions improve the digital fluency of their students? While a lot of changes have already been taking place in the premier circle of education at leading IITs and NITs what is the status in normal engineering colleges across India? How are they placed?

Industry talks about the shift in their business operation mode switching to the digital age. Over 14 percent of industry from all sectors is digitally mature. A lot needs to be done in the workplace.

Many companies including biggies like TCS Infosys Wipro Tech Mahindra and IBM are emphasising on “up-skilling” and reskilling for their employees to increase their “digital quotient” and “technology quotient” to stay ahead of business. Many leading industries have entered the education sector and tied up with leading educational institutions in India.

The new age skills called the “digital skills” also referred to as micro-credentials in western countries have hit our homes.

What is a micro-credential? It is a form of recognition for a skill or expertise typically using a certificate form of learning. It’s a small piece of learning. Micro-credential is for a period of learning typically anywhere between a few hours up to a maximum of 180 hours. Millions of micro-credentials are being offered worldwide through Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) platforms.

What is micro-credentials stacking and how does this change the future of education? Micro-credentials are not just stand-alone certificates. They are a part of a big related complex subject. The complex subject is broken down into a number of bite-sized smaller modules.

Individual micro-credential courses can be built in blocks to learn a complex subject. Student can acquire many of them in a sequential order and stack them as a part of his sensual continuing professional development. Stacking is building up of a skill from a lower level to a higher level under assistance. Complete stack of micro-credentials shall lead to a proficiency award. You can build your stack into a definition of who you are and what you are in terms of your learning and your skills.

Future of learning and work

Continuing professional development and micro-credentials are going to be part and parcel of the whole future of learning and work. There’s no two ways about it. We are going to move into a situation where the requirement is both continuous professional development and lifelong learning.

Now let us look at how industry is driving the inevitable change in education sector. There are two reasons for this.

First reason being the kinds of skills demanded by employers are a whole new area of skills particularly around data and digitisation of content. These are very fluid in nature and called liquid skills. Skills will change continuously. The acceleration of technology change in the world of work is going to mean that the kinds of skills needed around these technologies will constantly be changing.

The skills you learn will constantly need to be upgraded. It’s no longer the case that you study something for a certain period of time and then once you’ve learnt it and that is it and you are going to survive in your professional period.

Skill set upgrade

Second reason industry is getting into education. It’s been provided by individuals corporations typically the technology sector companies like Apple Microsoft and IBM. They are providing micro-credentials around the skill sets and technology skills they require in their business. Students required gaining further skills as a part of their long course.

University degree alone no longer guarantees you a job and even a post-graduate isn’t providing the full range of hybrid skills. Industries believe micro-credentials would supplement the University degree in the absence of a gap in the curriculum which perhaps is not role aligned in terms of learning outcomes.

Perhaps the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 also encourages such options to students to help them build their education qualification by way of mix and match to suit their job relevance in the workplace. May be one can acquire some micro-credentials plus 1-year of University degree and then build up his own portfolio that makes him quite differentiated in the job market place.

Building a portfolio

There will be options available. I don’t need a degree or I don’t need a post-graduation. I don’t need to commit myself to 4 years 6 years or 8 years of study in order to get to the workplace. We may see students dipping in to using micro-credentials getting a job then going back and perhaps doing a full-length degree to deck up his or her credentials.

A demand-driven change

So stacking up of these micro-credentials has become very prevalent. HCL “Techbee” programme is a classic initiative. Many more such changes can be expected. When a student goes back to University can possibly ask I already have all credentials which have been validated why can’t I get credit for those against your existing programme? Why do I have to do everything again?

We will soon see these changes and it’s demand-driven from the point of view of the learner as well as from the point of view of the employer so I think we’re moving into an era where the next five to 10 years everything is going to be really shaken up and I think COVID-19 has probably accelerated that in terms of the way in which we look at and what’s going to be mixed education provision.

Students collect credentials and mix and match and build their proficiency that fit them in workplace. This means you need to have a framework which shall be a part of your offering. Institutions must start to align with industry players in the market who enable them to offer the best possible value in education. Simple curriculum changes may not prove to be a stronger solution in the future. This is more precisely is the purpose of industry connect.

Cementing career growth

Industry connect cements relationship and helps in reviewing your offerings to students in terms of quality education in multiple options and helps you stay afloat in the competitive situation.

Where does this leave the traditional qualifications and development? University/institutions are going to be very important and they’re going to continue with their role in the tertiary education sector. Universities are already offering or developing micro-credentials for their own students in leading IITs and NITs. Efforts are being made all the time and continually to align micro-credentials frameworks with qualifications framework.

It’s not that one will replace the other but you will begin to see the way in which they complement each other. When a student leaves the University he should have basic degree plus micro-credentials in specific skills to be proficient in his learning outcomes and technology ready or industry ready or first hour job ready. Employers are looking for people with more than just a designation or more than a degree in a certain subject.

For instance an accountant is typically a person with accountancy background but also need other hybrid skills. The creation of jobs and job roles are hybrid in nature. An accountant is expected to be proficient in skills around accountancy and further have skills like data management data analytics business intelligence cyber security data governance on predictive analytics artificial intelligence and cloud computing.

Cave syndrome is being defined as a persistent unwillingness to leave the relative safety and security of the home to risk COVID infection or re-infection as the pandemic abates. Psychiatrist Alan Teo in Scientific American likens it to the Japanese hikikomori (or shut-in) syndrome in which an extreme form of agoraphobia takes hold and individuals isolate for six months or longer. This is a useful analogy that might help us understand how toxins in our social and physical environment trigger tendencies to cut oneself off from society—and might offer some solutions as well.

Shut-in syndrome occurs in many cultures and may be becoming more prevalent as technology makes it more viable to live in isolation or near-isolation. Michael Zeilinger wrote about hikikomori in his 2009 book Shutting Out The Sun: How Japan Created Its Own Lost Generation. Zeilinger describes individuals who keep to their rooms for years or decades at a time usually depending on family to meet their basic needs. Most or all of these individuals had experienced severe childhood bullying with resultant fear social anxiety shame and other emotions of disconnection from the social milieu including low self-worth. With concerted and focused mental health efforts Zeilinger described how some hikikomori were rehabilitated back into society—but this required the special attention of professionals and concerned community members. I assume but am not sure that others eventually come out of isolation on their own as well. But there are cases of people who have died in isolation. Social isolation itself also has deleterious effects on mental and physical health especially on those who are most vulnerable including in the U.S. immigrants minorities LGBT individuals and elders.

Resignation syndrome is an even more pronounced psychological withdrawal and was the subject of the Oscar-nominated short documentary Life Overtakes Me by John Haptas and Kristine Samuelson. Resignation syndrome is described in traumatized refugee children who seem to be having a severe survival brain “freeze” response to overwhelming trauma or who some speculate may be subconsciously taking on the martyr role to help their families. Susan Brink reported for NPR:

“The Swedish word uppgivenhetssyndrom sounds like what it is: a syndrome in which kids have given up on life. That's what several hundred children and adolescents have done — literally checked out of the world for months or years. They go to bed and don't get up. They're unable to move eat drink speak or respond. All of the victims of the disorder sometimes called resignation syndrome have been youngsters seeking asylum after a traumatic migration mostly from former Soviet and Yugoslav states. And all of them live in Sweden.”

These unfortunate children have been treated with generous TLC (tender loving care) by family members and other caregivers. This might facilitate at the neurobiological level a sense of safety and trust allowing them to return to conscious awareness and interaction.

A psychological correlate is involution in which thoughts and feelings are turned inward after meeting some kind of interpersonal barrier or setback leading to rumination isolation and social withdrawal.

For Asian Americans the nation’s atmosphere contains risks of not just COVID but the palpable risks of being targeted by violence in an atmosphere of anti-Asian sentiment amplified by aggressive political rhetoric blaming China for the virus. Moreover economic hardship and general distress also create anxiety which is likely bound or overridden by scapegoating Asians and Asian Americans.

Asian American parents have been less willing to send their children back to in-person schooling partly out of fears of facing racist abuse. (Balingit M Natanson H Chen Y. As schools reopen Asian American students are missing from classrooms. (Washington Post March 4 2021.)

Seemingly not a day has gone by recently without new reports of violent incidents against Asian Americans. Asian women attacked with a hammer in Hell’s Kitchen by another woman demanding that they take off their masks. Two older Asian American women slashed by a man with a knife at a San Francisco bus stop. An Asian American man pushing his toddler in a stroller pushed to the ground and punched by another man. On a far lesser scale that reminded me of the aggression that Black men face on a daily basis I’ve been yelled at by White men twice for wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt once in San Francisco and another time in the East Bay town of Livermore. (Far more often though I’ve been met with support and affirmation for wearing the T-shirt. The times are hopefully changing.)

Those who have been traumatized or who fear violence as well as those who fear infection have understandable reasons to be isolative or to be highly cautious about venturing outside into an uncertain environment. This is a psychic burden that must be consciously addressed by individuals media health systems communities and politicians. In many ways the traumatized and anxious are important bellwethers of our society. Their presence raises the questions “How well are we looking out for one another?"" “How well can any of us look out for ourselves?” and “How can we better care for those most vulnerable to infection or violence?”

Certainly making the physical environment more certain will help a great deal. The risk of COVID infection will decrease only as more people become vaccinated and the viral risks around the world abate. We can look out for each other by following CDC and local public health department guidelines using our common sense and empathy getting vaccinated and wearing masks as appropriate.

The risk of violence will only abate if we amplify social cohesion and work diligently at reducing the causes of violence. There is an active media campaign that is amplifying awareness about Asian American identity and issues but I’m not sure how we reach those who are most disconnected or unreceptive to media messages. The long-term solution must lie in promoting non-violent ways to deal with intra- and inter-personal distress and conflict throughout the pipeline that produces violent outcomes and also promoting cultural education awareness and literacy across the lifespan.

There are real toxins in our social and physical environment. Minimizing dangers is ignorant and foolhardy. Maximizing dangers might verge on paranoia but each individual must decide for themselves how they wish to hold perceived dangers.

I believe there is a middle path. We must inform ourselves about the risks and benefits of our social and physical environment. We must develop the quality of our supportive relationships. And we must develop our inner lives to meet the challenges of isolation disconnection and relationship itself. We must reach out to those in need. And we must continue to be brave in service to others because society needs our bravery.

As I wrote in a previous post:

“For this Buddhist psychiatrist the true Self is that which responds creatively to adversity and suffering—and every day of survival growth relatedness expression affirmation self-acceptance and self-compassion can be a victory for the true Self.”

I wish you well in cultivating your own sense of trust safety and social connection as we continue on in the pandemic. If you’re feeling very anxious or anguished reach out for support on available hotlines. No one gets through life alone but life has some very lonely moments indeed.

When hardware manufacturers release new drivers for Windows 10 they get added to the Windows Update as an optional driver update that users can install.

For the past week Windows Update has been pushing a new driver titled 'Advanced Micro Devices Inc. - SCSIAdapter - 9.3.0.221' to users of AMD-compatible motherboards.

Numerous users are reporting [1 2 3 4] that when they install this driver they are prompted to restart Windows 10 and are greeted with a Blue Screen of Death crash (BSOD) displaying an error stating that the PC has an ""INACCESSIBLE BOOT DEVICE.""

""Aorus Elite Master / 5800x owner just rebooted got the same BSOD / BIOS issue as everyone else from the Win10 update from today how do I remove that driver from Windows? ( I'm actually in safe mode )"" an affected Windows 10 user posted to Reddit.

Reports of this issue are also found in the Windows 10 Feedback Hub where users are complaining of the same errors.

Feedback Hub report about bad AMD SCSIAdapter driver

This error is commonly caused when Windows 10 attempts to start the computer and cannot access the configured boot disk for some reason.

Microsoft pulled the AMD driver

Due to the large number of people affected by the driver rollout Microsoft had pulled the driver from Windows Update approximately 21 hours ago as reported by Windows Latest.

""This driver was pulled from Windows Update"" a Microsoft software engineer posted to Reddit.

Based on the comments from the Microsoft engineer the driver was slowly rolled out at first to perform tests on its reliability. As the driver was rolled out to the correct machines during this first phase Microsoft did not see any telemetry causing concern.

A rezoning proposal has residents worried.,"Is Amazon looking to buy (and close) a popular Ohio golf course? A rezoning proposal has residents worried.

CANTON Ohio – This northeast Ohio city is seeking to rezone the Skyland Pines Golf Club property for its “best use” but few details have been released about what that might be.

Steve DiPietro co-owner of Skyland Pines said the rezoning is to better position the property if an opportunity arises. Despite rumors he said the land has not been listed or arranged for sale.

“Skyland’s ready for golf” he said adding that the event center also is accepting bookings.

If Canton City Council approves the rezoning Monday the course at 3550 Columbus Road NE could continue operating as a golf course and will receive a zoning designation of I-1 light industrial like much of the surrounding city property. Its current zoning is primarily general business and community services.

Skyland Pines is comprised of two parcels. The larger 132.9-acre parcel which would be rezoned is located in Canton. Another 6.62-acre parcel along the western portion is in Plain Township.

“Based on past intentions of the current ownership to sell the property planning staff is proposing this change in an effort to preemptively and properly zone this area with the highest and best use of the property if a sale were to occur again” states a memo from the Planning Commission secretary to City Council.

Skyland Pines’ website describes the 18-hole course as “one of the most popular in the area.” There’s also outdoor and indoor driving ranges and an events center that can accommodate up to 500 guests.

The late Joe DiPietro who also founded the Pizza Oven chain purchased Skyland Pines in 1972 and added a banquet facility. It’s since become known for hosting local fundraisers and tournaments.

What’s next for the rezoning?

A public hearing for the proposed rezoning of Skyland Pines and four other properties — including Stark Area Regional Transit Authority property on Gateway Boulevard SE slated for expansion and Stark Metropolitan Housing Authority property on Gonder Avenue SE intended for a collaborative supermarket and health clinic — will be at 7 p.m. Monday at City Hall. The council vote will follow during the regular meeting.

The Planning Department proposed the zone changes to better reflect the properties’ current or potential uses and the Planning Commission recommended City Council approve them. The secretary’s memo states that the rezonings are “in line with the theories of the comprehensive plan as they will promote the city’s competitiveness within the region and strengthen the city’s position to attract more development.”

The golf course is in Ward 6 which is represented by Canton Councilman Kevin Hall. He said he’s heard talk in the community that Amazon is interested in the property “but no one has said that to me.”

A resident of Plain Township who lives near Skyland Pines said he’s also heard rumors of Amazon’s interest from concerned neighbors.

When asked whether Amazon is considering a site in Canton company spokeswoman Jessica Pawl stated by email:

“Amazon is a dynamic business and we are constantly exploring new locations and weighing a variety of factors when deciding where to develop future sites to best serve customers however we have a policy of not commenting on our future road map and are not yet commenting on any specific operations plans.”

In November 2020 Amazon opened a fulfillment center at the former Rolling Acres Mall site in Akron. The facility was expected to employ about 1500 people at full capacity.

I host two Airbnb Olympian Experiences both of which are based on sharing my recipes. I’ve had some unique experiences with individuals or groups around the world which has been really fun. I love that food nourishes my body but also has the potential to nourish my soul. You come together with people around food around the table and tell stories and share memories. I get to have a kind of global kitchen party where I get invited into people’s kitchens – and they get invited into mine – working with people from around the world without having to travel.

Cheesecake with a side of Olympic value

In my ‘treat yourself’ experience we make a vegan cheesecake which is super tasty. We start off by making the recipe then we talk about the ‘why’ behind the ingredients: what’s the difference between whole-food sugar and refined sugar and why that matters. Then we have a competition decorating the cakes – some people’s cakes turn out perfect and others are a bit of a disaster and that’s what makes it fun. I share some fun tips and tricks along the way.

Check out Arianne’s experience here

After that I take my chef hat off and put my Olympian hat on exploring a bit about how I pivoted from professional luger to nutritionist. With cooking you get to learn something and take away a skill – and something delicious! But at the same time I weave in my story of how I got involved in nutrition how it impacts my life and how it can impact your life.

We also discuss overcoming breaking my back and dealing with chronic illness. All of these failures and pain that you as an athlete will have first-hand experience of that’s a global language which you can share with people. I find people relate to my stories and are inspired by them.

As one reviewer said: ‘This is so much more than a cooking class! Arianne’s experience is a combination of storytelling food and a little bit of learning. I walked away with a better understanding of certain ingredients and how they impact the body as well as feeling more confident in my baking skills’.

Building a brand

I think being a host is a great way to share your story and build your personal brand. The best thing is that you can take on experiences whenever you want. The internet makes that possible and I think that’s great way for athletes to build your brand build a little income and potentially discover other opportunities.

For example some of the people I’ve done experiences for host successful podcasts and after hearing a bit of my story have invited me onto them which has been a really authentic media segue. Furthermore one of my favourite parts of being an Airbnb Experiences host has been working with business teams. Airbnb has opened an experience page specifically for corporate teams and that’s a really big focus for me because it’s something I’m really passionate about.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdGlueS1ob21lLXZpbGxhZ2Utc2FsdC1sYWtlLWNpdHktaG9tZWxlc3Mtc2hvcHMtYWlyYm5iLTIwMjEtNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Salt Lake City Building a Tiny Home Village to House the Homeless,"""The most important part is to create an environment socially and physically that facilitates connection with others"" Greeny said.

I really enjoy meeting people through the Airbnb host set up. When I first retired from professional sport I had this feeling that I was really disconnected from the everyday athlete and I shied away from people because I had this internal competitive fire burning. I had to recalibrate my expectations and being a host helped me adapt to life after sport.

I once took a client who had never even seen the ocean let alone been on it out paddling. That was a watershed moment. I recognised that I didn’t need it to be competitive or part of some elite competition. There was just this great joy of connecting with people and sharing an experience to give someone a chance to get out and see the ocean and nature. It’s quite spectacular. That was something that I wanted to do post sport and the host experience is a terrific way to do it.

The way that being an Airbnb host works mean you get to set the schedule and be able to make progress on a venture that you care about. Sports particularly endurance sports can be a very solitary endeavour and the paddling combines a nice mix of social aspects with time out on the ocean and the quiet that comes with it. It can be challenging but you meet great characters and deal with all types of people. It gives me a living and those interactions are in their own way fulfilling. It’s a great way to spend the day.

Starting your own experience

The one thing you think it will be at the beginning is the one thing you can guarantee it’s not! There’s no straight line as everybody knows. Look to make incremental changes not wholesale swings but just adapt to what is happening.

Airbnb’s model is around accessibility so focus on making your experience open. I hope that’s what I’m providing. Paddling can be quite tough for someone who’s intimidated by the ocean so we have six-person paddle boards which are very difficult to fall off and they actually have a bench installed on them so that people with mobility issues can use them. The idea is that you can give it a go whether you’re 17 or 70.

People will come to your experience because of your background as an athlete but you’ll also get plenty of people who don’t and it can be intimidating going up against an Olympian. I find that with some clients but they get here and realise that it’s way easier and more accessible than they thought it was. Guests sometimes think there’s only going to be one mindset because they’re out with a former professional athlete but there’s not: I’m 45 now I’m lazy too!"

It may be early days for the reckoning on the “Other Bets” which have absorbed some $3.2 billion in capital expenditure and reported operating losses of about $24.3 billion since the renaming. After all when Mark Shmulik a Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst recently attempted to value Alphabet’s parts separately to see if the sum of these valuations would be greater than the current whole he suggested that “Other Bets” could be worth $75 per share or more than $50 billion. That’s 2.9% of his full sum-of-the-parts valuation — not bad for businesses that provide between 0.3% and 0.5% of Alphabet’s revenue quarter after quarter.

More than half of that “Other Bets” valuation though would come from Waymo LLC the self-driving taxi company whose chief executive officer John Krafcik stepped down last month after it became clear the promise of self-driving wouldn’t be fulfilled as soon as many tech optimists expected a few years ago. Time was when some investors valued Waymo above $100 billion; that number has reportedly melted to about $30 billion. How the business can make money in the near future is still unclear.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy92YW5lc3NhLWh1ZGdlbnMtanVzdC1yZWxlYXNlZC1yZWZyZXNoaW5nbHktMTY0MzAwODI1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vanessa Hudgens Just Released A Refreshingly Tasty Line Of Cactus Water,"The summer of 2021 may be all about hard seltzer brands like Vizzy White Claw and Bud Light but if you're looking for something a little different to quench your thirst actress Vanessa Hudgens has got the thing you need.

Available in both Wild Prickly Pear and Wild Prickly Pear with Ginger & Lime the organic sip is definitely one that you'll want to keep handy at your next backyard event. And they make super great mixers—just in case you wanted to pour your favorite alcoholic choice in for a slammin' good time.

Each of the Caliwater flavors only include 25 calories per can (which is half the amount of coconut water!) are vegan Kosher and non-GMO. Also known to support hydration Caliwater drinks are proven to help with hangovers too. And we've all needed that (or will need it this summer) from time to time.

Feel like you've seen this brand around before? Well technically you're right. Caliwater first launched in 2014 with a backing from Trevena who eventually purchased the brand from the initial founder. Now however Caliwater is back with a new vision new packaging and a poppin' new taste brought to you by its two new founders.

Caliwater can be found in slim 12-ounce cans and are available through the website in a 4-pack sampler pack (which includes two of each flavor) for $11.99 or single flavor 12-packs for $32.99. But if you join their subscription program you can save a few bucks on the pack of your choice. And really what could be better than that?

It may be early days for the reckoning on the “Other Bets” which have absorbed some $3.2 billion in capital expenditure and reported operating losses of about $24.3 billion since the renaming. After all when Mark Shmulik a Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst recently attempted to value Alphabet’s parts separately to see if the sum of these valuations would be greater than the current whole he suggested that “Other Bets” could be worth $75 per share or more than $50 billion. That’s 2.9% of his full sum-of-the-parts valuation — not bad for businesses that provide between 0.3% and 0.5% of Alphabet’s revenue quarter after quarter.

More than half of that “Other Bets” valuation though would come from Waymo LLC the self-driving taxi company whose chief executive officer John Krafcik stepped down last month after it became clear the promise of self-driving wouldn’t be fulfilled as soon as many tech optimists expected a few years ago. Time was when some investors valued Waymo above $100 billion; that number has reportedly melted to about $30 billion. How the business can make money in the near future is still unclear.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy92YW5lc3NhLWh1ZGdlbnMtanVzdC1yZWxlYXNlZC1yZWZyZXNoaW5nbHktMTY0MzAwODI1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vanessa Hudgens Just Released A Refreshingly Tasty Line Of Cactus Water,"The summer of 2021 may be all about hard seltzer brands like Vizzy White Claw and Bud Light but if you're looking for something a little different to quench your thirst actress Vanessa Hudgens has got the thing you need.

Last summer amid uprisings protesting police murders of innocent Black people and record approval of the Black Lives Matter movement the corporate scramble to appear on the “right” side of history has extended far beyond the bounds of just one month.

The tobacco industry is no exception. Despite trying to pitch itself as a partner to Black-led organizations Big Tobacco has targeted Black communities for generations with multi-billion dollar marketing campaigns and a plethora of deadly products. Far from a partner Big Tobacco’s claims of allyship are shallow and hypocritical.

For George Floyd buying tobacco products proved deadly. On May 25 2020 George Floyd purchased a pack of cigarettes with a suspected counterfeit $20 bill. Shortly after he was arrested and police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds killing him.

Tragically this is not the first “arrest-to-murder” event involving tobacco products. On July 17 2014 police stopped Eric Garner and accused him of selling untaxed cigarettes. Minutes later Eric Garner was killed famously marked by his final words to the police holding him down “I can’t breathe.”

Shortly after George Floyd’s murder Altria the maker of Marlboro cigarettes got right to work positioning its deadly brand. On June 5 2020 Altria announced a donation of $5 million “to address systemic racism faced by Black Americans and advance social and economic equity.” Altria committed to a “Day of Healing” on Juneteenth voiced support for removal of confederate statues and pledged to support racial justice organizations.

The industry’s attempts to infiltrate Black institutions and co-opt moments of reckoning goes beyond the corporate Blackwashing of 2020. For years Eric Garner’s death has been cited by Rev. Al Sharpton and his organization the National Action Network (NAN) as the reason to oppose tobacco regulation. Sharpton has gone so far as to warn of “the unintended consequences of banning cigarettes… giving police new reasons to lock up Black males.”

But police have never needed the rule of law to justify violence against Black people and Black-led tobacco control groups have blasted Sharpton’s industry-influenced viewpoints. NAN has a longstanding financial relationship with RJ Reynolds a major menthol producer. Big Tobacco ties aside Rev. Sharpton’s claims just don’t add up: the Black community loses 1000 lives annually to police violence and 45000 lives from tobacco-related disease. All Black lives matter — so we need to address both systemic police violence and the tobacco epidemic.

The tobacco industry has targeted many Black-led organizations including the NAACP to insidiously insert itself into the Black community. These connections only further Big Tobacco’s intentions to profit off Black communities as much as possible often employing racist stereotypes and marketing tactics to do so.

Beyond today’s marketing strategies the tobacco industry’s intricate ties to slavery and colonizer violence runs deep. In the early 1700s enslaved Black bodies on plantations harvested booming tobacco crops on lands violently stolen from Indigenous peoples holding knowledge of and sacred relationship with the tobacco plant. Fast forward and see the modern portrayal of Jim Crow in marketing to the Black community. Today Altria is headquartered in Richmond Virginia — the former capital of the Confederacy and the birthplace of tobacco farming in the Americas.

The rise of the Black Lives Matter movement in the U.S. has reignited awareness of the link to Pan-African impacts of white supremacy and its damning legacy. These impacts are present in the economic and social dynamics of major tobacco-growing countries on the African continent. Tobacco corporations perpetuate unethical working conditions that prop up the inherent neocolonialism and racism of the tobacco industry. If not for the on-the-ground activists confronting these corporations many in the Global North would not know how deeply Big Tobacco has implemented these strategies across Africa. A long view of history reveals the racist roots of the tobacco industry from seed to cigarette.

The pennies that tobacco corporations donate are a public relations strategy meant to buy public good will — not address this legacy of exploiting Black lives and labor. First we must address that historical truth with reconciliation and reparations. Then we can then begin to talk about the modern reparations tobacco corporations owe in the form of liability for the death and disease their products cause. To say the least: $5 million isn’t going to cut it.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Throughout the pandemic we’ve seen increased attempts by bad actors to commit fraud and offer counterfeit products. Our teams have continued to innovate to protect our store helped our selling partners keep their virtual doors open and ensured that the vast majority of customers continue to shop with confidence from our broad selection of authentic products. Our Brand Protection Report is the first report in which we provide a holistic view of our anti-counterfeiting efforts and I’m proud to share the progress our teams have made as we continue to drive to zero counterfeits.

The 2020 Brand Protection Report shows Amazon’s significant innovation and worldwide progress in combatting counterfeit products and protecting customers and brands. Highlights include information about how:

Amazon invested over $700 million to protect its stores from fraud and abuse.

Amazon employed more than 10000 people to protect its store from fraud and abuse.

Amazon’s verification processes prevented over 6 million attempts to create selling accounts stopping bad actors before they published a single product for sale.

Only 6% of attempted account registrations passed Amazon’s robust verifications processes and listed products for sale.

Amazon detected and seized more than 2 million counterfeit products that were sent to its fulfillment centers before the items were sent to customers. Amazon destroyed those products to prevent them from being resold elsewhere in the supply chain.

Amazon blocked more than 10 billion suspected bad listings before they were published in its stores.

Amazon Transparency

Fewer than 0.01% of all products sold on Amazon received a counterfeit complaint from customers. Those complaints were investigated for accuracy and acted upon as appropriate.

More than 7000 small and medium-sized businesses were connected to trusted law firms in the U.S. and Europe through IP Accelerator

Amazon established its Counterfeit Crimes Unit to build and refer cases to law enforcement undertake independent investigations or joint investigations with brands and pursue civil litigation against counterfeiters.

The Brand Protection Report also outlines Amazon’s anti-counterfeiting approach which includes:

Robust proactive controls. Amazon leverages a combination of advanced machine learning capabilities and expert human investigators to protect its store proactively from bad actors and bad products. Amazon is constantly innovating in this space to stay ahead of bad actors and their continued attempts to circumvent its controls.

Brands know their products best. They know their logos patterns and intellectual property inside and out. Amazon empowers brands to partner with us through tools like Brand Registry Transparency and Holding counterfeiters accountable. Amazon continues to innovate on its robust proactive controls and powerful tools for brands and won’t rest until there are zero counterfeits in its store. However this is an escalating battle with criminals that continue to look for ways to sell counterfeits and the only way to permanently stop these counterfeiters is to hold them accountable through the court system and criminal prosecution.

We are excited by what we were able to achieve in 2020 but we will not rest until we get to zero counterfeits. Amazon will continue to invest and innovate to protect customers brands and our selling partners and we look forward to increased collaboration with brands and law enforcement to hold counterfeiters accountable.

Noah Ruiz 4 loves SpongeBob and popsicles so when he learned there was a sweet treat that combined the two he ordered some off Amazon Prime.

To be exact he ordered 918 of them.

Noah’s mom Jennifer Bryant told CNN she had let the 4-year-old who has autism use her laptop for remote learning. While she was busy in another room Noah apparently navigated to the Amazon Prime account she shares with her sister and ordered the popsicles without telling her.

Three huge boxes each weighing 70 pounds and requiring immediate freezing arrived at Noah’s aunt’s house shortly thereafter according to CNN.

The 51 cases of SpongeBob popsicles cost just under $2619. Amazon said they were non-refundable because they came from a third-party vendor.

The whole ordeal left Noah’s mom a single mother of three and social work student with quite the bill.

A family friend stepped in to help by starting a GoFundMe to cover Noah’s splurge. The campaign quickly raised more than enough for the popsicles reaching more than $23000 in a week.

Bryant says the extra funds will help with Noah’s schooling and the extra educational support he needs because he has autism.

As for Noah his popsicles melted in just two days CNN reports. But his real dream is to meet SpongeBob in person.

Four-year-old Noah Ruiz loves two things: Popsicles and SpongeBob.

And when he discovered both objects of his passion had been combined into one fruity and delicious icy treat he did the only sensible thing: he ordered them.

To be exact he ordered 918 of them. From his mom’s Amazon Prime account. Without telling her.

Noah’s mom Jennifer Bryant had let Noah use her laptop for remote learning when his iPad wasn’t working. She was busy in another room when Noah evidently navigated his way into her Amazon Prime account which she shares with her sister who lives nearby.

In retrospect there were signs something was about to happen.

“He kept saying the number ’51.’ ” she said. “All day he was walking around saying ‘51 51.’”

But Jennifer didn’t think much of it because sometimes he repeats things: “I really wasn’t surprised because he was diagnosed with ASD (autism spectrum disorder).”

A phone call from an exasperated sister

Then she got the call.

“She was fussing and cussing and she said to me ‘You know you really need to stop ordering all this stuff.’”

Three huge boxes each weighing 70 pounds and requiring immediate freezing had arrived at her sister’s house.

“I said ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about.’”

That’s when Jennifer discovered she was the proud owner of 51 cases of SpongeBob Popsicles costing just under $2619.

Suddenly Noah’s repeated mantra of “51 51…” started to make sense.

A frozen headache

Amazon wouldn’t take the ice pops back because they came from a third-party vendor. Her credit card is investigating but so far hasn’t issued a refund. For a terrifying moment Bryant a mother of three with some big school bills of her own had no idea how she was going to pay her tuition this semester.

A friend and fellow student at NYU’s Silver School of Social Work started a GoFundMe for her hoping to help pay off at least some of the Popsicles.

And that brings us to our sweet ending. (And no it’s not that Noah got to eat all 918 Popsicles in some sort of preschool Bacchanalia; they melted in two days.)

The GoFundMe paid off the ice pops within 24 hours and the donations kept coming in climbing way beyond the original target.

Jennifer says she’ll use the extra money to pay for Noah’s schooling and the extra educational support he needs. She’s hoping she’ll be able to send him to a special school for children on the autism spectrum. Noah would like that too but his real dream is just to meet SpongeBob in person.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vamVmZi1iZXpvcy1yZWFkLWJpbGxpb25haXJlcy1hbWF6b24tcmV2aWV3cy1mcm9tLTIwLXllYXJzLWFnby0yMDIxLTXSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2plZmYtYmV6b3MtcmVhZC1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZXMtYW1hem9uLXJldmlld3MtZnJvbS0yMC15ZWFycy1hZ28tMjAyMS01P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jeff Bezos: Read the Amazon founder's entertaining product reviews,"Jeff Bezos' old Amazon review profile has been unearthed.

Bezos wrote a review for the 1997 movie ""Life Is Beautiful"" on March 17 2020. He called the Oscar winner a ""masterpiece.""

The review reads: ""This movie is absolutely all it's cracked up to be. Hysterically funny and simultaneously a tear-jerker – it's ultimately very uplifting. The cinematography is also fantastic – amazing use of color.

""The DVD has dubbed English as an option but I strongly recommend going with the subtitles instead so you can hear Benigni's amazing acting and passion.

Too bad the DVD doesn't include any deleted scenes. With Benigni I think it would be particularly fun to see out-takes. Absolutely a great movie!""

2. Canon 18×50 Image Stabilization All-Weather Binoculars review:

Jeff Bezos reviews Canon binoculars on September 7 2000.

Amazon



In September of 2000 the Amazon founder shared his thoughts on the ""best binoculars"" he'd ever used.







He wrote: ""The problem with high power binoculars is that humans can't hold them steady and that jitter makes it impossible to really look at something without a tripod.

""The image stabilization in this pair solves that problem and holds things rock steady. This is an expensive product that clearly distinguishes itself and one of those products that technology makes seem a little magic.

""I have only two small complaints: First for a product this expensive they should pre-install the neck strap for you — not a big deal but it would be nice for the customer. Second I wish the lens cap covers were higher quality and attachable to the unit so they wouldn't get lost. Again not a big deal.

These are without a doubt the best binoculars I've ever used.""

This was his most popular review with 136 people voting it ""helpful.""

3. ""The Proving Ground: The Inside Story of the 1998 Sydney to Hobart Race"" review:

Jeff Bezos reviews ""The Proving Ground: The Inside Story of the 1998 Sydney to Hobart Race"" on June 10 2001.

Amazon



Bezos reviewed a book of eyewitness accounts about how the 1998 Sydney to Hobart race became one of the most disastrous sailing events in modern history.

The review reads: ""This book is about people – an incredibly interesting assortment of determined competitive people thrust into a circumstance more challenging and dangerous than any of them expected.

Bruce Knecht captures acts of heroism and frailty but in a display of astonishing writerly discipline he never judges these people. Judging these strong people would inevitably over-simplify the reality of human behavior under life-threatening stress. The way Knecht does it as we read we get to wonder how we would react.""

4. ""Project Orion: The True Story of the Atomic Spaceship"" review:

Jeff Bezos reviews ""Project Orion: The True Story of the Atomic Spaceship"" on April 14 2002.

Amazon



A book about a study of a starship intended to be propelled by explosions of atomic bombs appealed to the billionaire's ""dream"" of visiting space.

In April 2002 he wrote: ""For those of us who dream of visiting the outer planets seeing Saturn's rings up close without the intermediation of telescopes or charge-coupled devices well we pretty much *have* to read ""Project Orion.""

""In 1958 some of the world's smartest people including famous physicist Freeman Dyson (the author's father) expected to visit the outer planets in ""Orion"" a nuclear-bomb propelled ship big enough and powerful enough to seat its passengers in lazy-boy recliners. They expected to start their grand tour by 1970. This was not pie-in-the-sky optimism; they had strong technical reasons for believing they could do it.

To pull this book together George Dyson did an astonishing amount of research into this still largely classified project. And maybe because he's connected to Orion through his father the author captures the strong emotion of the project and the team. Highly recommended.""

5. ""Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom"" review:

Jeff Bezos reviews ""Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom"" on January 23 2003.

Amazon



In 2003 Bezos gushed about a 2004 science fiction book. The novel takes place in the 22nd century mostly in Walt Disney World.

After quoting Star Trek the Amazon founder praised the book effusively. He wrote: ""In this fun fast book the clearly talented Cory Doctorow explores a full-on reputation economy. With the help of a sophisticated real-time network people accumulate and lose a reputation currency called ""whuffie.""

""The ideas are an incredibly rich playground and the author doesn't make you suffer through flat characters or clunky prose to get to them. On the contrary these are totally alive characters set in a deeply conjured world (which world is Disney World a place you can feel the author's passion for).

""By the end you'll know the characters well enough to be able to judge what impact this new world has — or doesn't have — on the fundamentals of human nature.

Cory Doctorow deserves much whuffie for this novel. Highly recommended.""

Despite receiving praises from Bezos author Cory Doctorow has been consistently vocal of his criticism of Amazon on his Twitter.

Aiaska Airlines is the newest member of the Oneworld airline alliance formally joining in March.

Flyers will notice better connecting options and increased cooperation between member airlines.

Frequent Alaska flyers benefit the most with elite status carrying over to 13 other carriers.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Alaska Airlines in March became the 14th and newest member of the Oneworld airline alliance joining the likes of American Airlines Qatar Airways British Airways in the global partnership.

Airline alliances are built on the premise that not a group of carriers can better connect the world than just one can. Each of America's three largest international airlines belongs to an airline alliance but the Oneworld alliance is now the only one to include two American carriers: American and Alaska.

By partnering alliances can also offer flyers greater conveniences when flying on member carriers like complementary route networks and single-ticket itineraries across multiple airlines. Elite status holders can also benefit by having greater access to upgrades and airport amenities like priority check-in.

Here's how Alaska flyers can benefit when flying on the new Oneworld partner airlines and how Oneworld flyers can benefit when flying Alaska.

Earning miles on more airlines

Members of Alaska's Mileage Plan program can now earn miles when flying on any one of Oneworld's 14 member airlines. Besides Alaska that list includes American British Airways Qatar Airways Cathay Pacific Airways Finnair Qantas Malaysia Airlines Japan Airlines Iberia Royal Air Maroc Royal Jordanian Airlines S7 Airlines and SriLankan Airlines.

And the same goes when loyalists of other Oneworld airlines fly on Alaska as they can earn miles for their preferred airline's program. The offering gives flyers greater flexibility to fly different airlines especially if one has a better schedule or doesn't serve a desired route while still earning miles that can lead to free flights or elite status.

Alaska flyers wanting to travel outside of Alaska's route network can do so easier now that the airline has 13 partners around the world. Oneworld airlines will be tasked with bringing Alaska's flyers where the Seattle-based airline cannot.

Flying to Europe? British Airways Finnair and Iberia can help with that. Canada Latin America and the Caribbean? American Airlines will be helpful there. Africa and the Middle East? Qatar Airways Royal Jordanian and Royal Air Maroc have a strong network there. Asia? Cathay Pacific Airways and SirLankan Airlines are good bets. Russia? S7 Airlines can help with internal flights.

A flyer wanting to go from Portland Oregon to Doha Qatar can book a single-ticket itinerary through Alaska that includes flights on Alaska and Qatar Airways. Amman Jordan is an easy Alaska flight to New York to meet the non-stop Royal Jordanian flight.

Single-ticket itineraries also mean baggage is automatically brought to the next flight even if on a different airline and fees are only paid once.

More upgrades for frequent flyers

Alaska flyers with MVP 75K status only are eligible for complimentary upgrades on American when flying domestically or between the US Canada Mexico the Caribbean and Central America. Later this year those status holders will also be given certificates to upgrade on American's international flights.







All Alaska elite status holders regardless of rank will be allowed to select American's ""Main Cabin Extra"" seats if available for no extra charge. MVP status holders can do so 24 hours in advance while higher ranks can do so at booking.

American flyers with Executive Platinum status only are eligible for complimentary upgrades on Alaska and will be automatically placed on the upgrade list. The only exception is when Executive Platinum holders book ""saver"" fares on Alaska the equivalent of basic economy.

All Alaska elite status holders regardless of rank will be allowed to select Alaska's ""premium cabin"" seats if available for no extra charge. Gold status holders with certain ticket types can choose the seats 48 hours from departure while higher ranks can do so sooner.

Upgrades on either airline are not guaranteed but are a huge incentive to keep booking higher-priced fares on each airline.

More perks on the ground

Becoming an elite status holder on Alaska also makes you an elite status holder in Oneworld and that means more perks when traveling across the alliance's network even if not on Alaska.

An Alaska MVP status holder is automatically given Oneworld Ruby status which includes access to business class check-in lines preferred and pre-reserved seating and priority on waitlists and standby lists. MVP Gold status holders on Alaska are Oneworld Sapphire meaning they get all the Ruby perks and more including access to business class lounges priority boarding extra baggage allowance and priority baggage handling.

An Alaska MVP 75K status holder is given Oneworld Emerald status which includes Ruby and Sapphire perks plus access to first class lounges first class check-in lanes and priority security lanes.

President Clinton wanted to be able to announce something to look like he was doing something after the event since initially there was speculation that the explosion was terrorist-related rather than an accident.

Airlines have wanted customers to show ID for a long time because they don’t want their tickets to be transferable. Part of making sure every passenger pays as much money for a seat as possible means ensuring that cheap seats can’t be resold. Otherwise the airline wouldn’t be able to sell last minute tickets for the last seat available for a premium – other passengers would just resell their tickets at a profit instead.

You can still fly without ID however. The TSA has a procedure to let you clear security checkpoints without one. People lose their drivers licenses all the time.

American Airlines has a procedure for passengers to fly without ID just like TSA does. However they’re cracking down on the ID requirement when you get a boarding pass from an agent at a gate trying to ensure that gate agents insist on seeing IDs the way that ticket counter agents do.

American Airlines is facing numerous setbacks in South America.

Rising COVID-19 cases in Chile Brazil and Peru forced the airline to cut flights in April.

Civil unrest and protests in Colombia are now further threatening success in the region.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

American Airlines' expansion strategy in South America is experiencing a seemingly never-ending stream of hurdles.

Tourism-dependent Latin America was among the first regions to welcome US tourists during the coronavirus pandemic and American was standing ready to fly eager travelers. Earlier in the year the airline had announced new flights to cities in Chile Colombia and Brazil in a bid to attract leisure flyers as it waited for business travel to recover.

But while the continent appeared to be welcoming at first doing business in South America quickly proved problematic.

Flights to Santiago Chile were among the first to be impacted when the country closed its borders for the month of April. American had planned to launch a new non-stop route from New York using one of its largest aircraft the Boeing 777-200 on May 7.

Chile appeared promising when it opened to Americans in November 2020. But a spike in COVID-19 cases following the country's summer season prompted the government to once again close its borders to tourists.

The state of emergency in the country planned for the month of April has now been extended through June according to the US Embassy in Chile. American as a result pushed back the launch of its inaugural New York-Santiago flight to July 2; though Chile may extend its border closure depending on conditions in the country.

Spiking COVID-19 cases were also the reasoning for flight reductions to Brazil and Peru the airline confirmed to Insider's Brittany Chang in April. Both countries still allow US citizens to enter despite the rise in cases according to the US Embassies in Brazil and Peru.

In Colombia however American faces a new challenge: civil unrest. Protests have gripped the country with some turning violent and taking the lives of at least 26 people according to ABC News. The Washington Post Editorial Board is also predicting that Colombia's levels of unrest could spread to regional countries like Peru.

American in response has issued a travel alert for the Colombian city of Cali where the protests have been the most extreme allowing travelers to change their flight to any day between May 4 and May 18.

The protests could discourage future travelers from booking trips to Colombia or encourage flyers with existing bookings to change away from Colombia at a time when American is deploying some of its largest aircraft to the country.

Rebuilding a lost South American network at the wrong time

American's desire to grow in South American comes as the airline seeks to rebuild following the loss of a partner in LATAM Airlines prior to the pandemic.

Delta Air Lines spent $1.9 billion in 2019 for a 20 percent stake in LATAM significantly growing its presence in South America. The move saw LATAM drop American and the Oneworld airline alliance to join Delta and the SkyTeam airline alliance leaving American to rebuild in a historically profitable region.







""Latin America has for roughly 30 years now been one of American's international beachhead"" Henry Harteveldt travel analyst and cofounder of Atmosphere Research Group told Insider. ""In fact it's been American's most successful region outside of the US.""

With LATAM gone American was left with Brazil's GOL Linhas Aéreas a limited partner in the region. But GOL didn't have the reach of the larger airlines that were now aligned with American's competitors.

Delta bought a new partner in LATAM Airlines alongside its existing partner in Aerolíneas Argentinas while United had Avianca and Copa Airlines. To regrow its South American network American chose to launch new routes from the US with a domestic partner JetBlue Airways.

American launched its routes to Colombia Brazil and Chile in a partnership with JetBlue dubbed the ""Northeast Alliance."" For American the partnership provides access to customers across JetBlue's network that can connect onto the new routes.

""It's understandable that American would be eager to start rebuilding its network in Latin America because it is so strategically important to the airline right now"" Harteveldt said.

Ceding Europe to United and Delta for now

South America isn't totally lost for American as the airline still operates around 30 daily flights to cities across the continent. Cirium data also shows a steady stream of cargo-only flights operating to Santiago from Miami in 2021 which Harteveldt says helps stem the losses.

But while American focuses on South America its competitors are locked in on the reopening European continent. United and Delta were both quick to resume flights to European countries open to Americans like Greece and Iceland while also starting new routes to Croatia.

""I think American is looking at this and saying 'we're going to be very careful about which routes we pick and which battles want to fight'"" Harteveldt said thinking back to 2018 when American launched Iceland flights alongside Icelandair now-defunct Wow Air with flights to Dallas. But the airline hasn't completely ignored Europe nor a gradually reopening Middle East.

A new route between New York and Athens Greece is scheduled to launch on June 2 and existing routes to Athens from Chicago and Philadelphia will resume in June and August respectively. The airline also just launched a new route between New York and Tel Aviv Israel with plans for another route to Israel from Miami which may pay off as the Middle Eastern country starts to accept vaccinated tour groups.

American may also be waiting for the European Union to open its doors to US citizens Harteveldt says so the airline can fly more passengers on its traditional routes to cities like Paris France; Madrid Spain; and Rome Italy.

But success in South America remains challenging as new and unexpected roadblocks appear that are outside of the airline's control.

""It's not American's fault for example that you had a strong surge of virus in a particular country Harteveldt said. ""It's not American's fault that travel restrictions are in place when American may have thought that some of these restrictions would have been eased or removed.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvdW5pdGVkLWFjY2Vzc2libGUtYmxpbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minor hiccups aside United strives to be accessible for the blind,"Like many fellow flyers I severely limited my travel over the last year due to the coronavirus pandemic. And like many I also saw the light at the end of the tunnel when the vaccines began to roll out.

Education workers like myself were placed in a higher priority group under Arizona’s vaccine distribution plan and I was able to get my first dose in early March. Most of my family members in Texas were also getting vaccinated so I decided to book a flight from Phoenix to Houston to see them a few weeks after my second dose.

While exploring my options I learned that United was offering a sale between Phoenix and Houston which would also give me the opportunity to fly on a Boeing 737 MAX. I booked with the carrier for the first time since middle school.

Thereafter I contacted United’s accessibility desk to add my guide dog to the reservation and find out how to submit paperwork required under the new service animal regulations since I couldn’t find the information on its website. I was told that since the new regulations do not require airlines to collect the paperwork ahead of time United is only requiring service animal handlers to carry the completed form with them while traveling.

When I downloaded the form from United’s website I was able to fill it out and print it without issue. United appears to have resolved the form accessibility issues I flagged up in a previous article.

With an actual trip reservation in place I was able to try out some of the functionality within United’s new app that I could not test when writing about it in November. While I could discern all the options available purchasing an upgrade or prepaying for a checked bag was not possible for me through the app because some form fields on the payment info page were not properly labeled. I was however easily able to purchase a first class upgrade for my return flight and pre-pay for a bag on United’s website using my laptop.

The process to check in for my flights using the app had some minor issues. On the page requiring me to acknowledge United’s face mask policy and to confirm that I was not experiencing COVID-19 symptoms there was no check box or other control announced to indicate if these policies had been acknowledged. Despite this I was still able to acknowledge “I agree” to both statements by double-tapping on them.

A few weeks before my flight to Houston I used the seating accommodation request form on United’s website to ask for a non-bulkhead window seat with extra legroom for my guide dog PJ and me since we were in coach for the flight. A few hours after submitting my request I received an email from the carrier’s Accessibility Desk confirming my request and assigning me a seat meeting my needs.

When I pre-boarded the aircraft PJ and I walked down the jetway by ourselves and a flight attendant working in the galley helped me to locate my seat at which time we got settled in for our flight.

Airlines are required to provide individualized safety briefings to passengers with disabilities but a flight attendant never returned to my seat to provide one which was a little disappointing. As a fairly frequent flyer the only real information I ask is how many rows away are the nearest exits.

The coach seats on United’s MAX aircraft feature a device holder and felt comfortable to me. The extra legroom really helped considering I was sharing my foot space with a 70-pound Labrador retriever. Two AC outlets can be found for every three seats.

After takeoff the cabin crew handed out snack bags containing Biscoff cookies pretzels a small bottle of water and a hand wipe followed by a drink service with soda and some hot beverages on offer. While I had intended to listen to a couple of podcasts during the flight the quieter MAX cabin resulted in me napping for about half of the flight.

Houston is among the airports that offer Aira’s free service which connects blind and low vision users with remotely-located trained agents who provide visual interpretation. I opened the Aira app after landing and used it to get from my gate to baggage claim where my family was meeting me.

The first class seat on my return flight was typical. It featured an AC power plug in the center console below the drink area a location I find convenient. After takeoff the flight attendants offered everybody in first class drinks and a choice of a hot chicken and cheese sandwich hot tomato basil sandwich or a snack box. I opted for the chicken and cheese sandwich which was quite tasty. The lead flight attendant was sure to let me know when she was giving me anything or clearing away items that had been used.

I reclined my seat after the meal and slept until about the time we began our descent into Phoenix. The lead flight attendant checked to see if I needed help getting to the lavatory before we landed in Phoenix. I really appreciated the extra effort she showed towards me on this flight.

Since Aira is not offered for free in Phoenix I used the Airport Meet and Assist service to get to baggage claim where I was met by my wife grabbed my luggage and headed home.

Between living in a market dominated by American Airlines and Southwest Airlines and my tendency to stick with companies I am familiar with I had not really considered United as an option before booking this trip. Despite a couple of relatively minor bumps in the road though I had a great experience flying United and would not hesitate to do so again if it is my best option.

CHPE cable project raises numerous concerns over impacts on the Hudson Indigenous communities and more.

Let’s use NY’s valuable incentives to meet our urgent needs for reliable truly clean energy while avoiding harm to the environment and communities.

Updated January 27 2022

Valuable “Tier 4” New York State renewable energy credits are designed to promote the transmission of green carbon-free electric power to New York City on a large scale. Bringing large amounts of renewable energy to New York City is an essential part of New York’s transition to a carbon-free electric grid. One transmission project selected for these incentives the Champlain Hudson Power Express would bury cable in the Hudson – digging up the river bottom – and rely on massive destructive hydropower – energy considered “renewable” but with damaging impacts of its own.

Learn more: Riverkeeper.org/CHPE

The Champlain Hudson Power Express (CHPE) has been on the table for more than a decade and it relies on power from massive hydroelectric dams in Quebec. Such facilities have a long history of destroying rivers and harming Indigenous communities by disrupting their relationship with the land and poisoning the food web with methylmercury. Any dam destroys otherwise free-flowing rivers with profound changes to ecology and water quality; these large dam projects are destructive on a massive scale. What’s more the reservoirs behind dams produce greenhouse gases.

Other proposals by contrast would transmit wind or solar power from within New York State generating jobs and revenue here rather than Canada. Some would use existing rights of way such as rail or highway routes instead of the river. Some would use the river but for fewer miles than CHPE.

Riverkeeper urged New York State to prioritize projects with the least impacts relative to these and other factors in its selection projects to receive the sought-after “Tier 4 renewable energy credits.” In our letter to the Governor July 12 Riverkeeper asked that the selected projects support New York State businesses; that they avoid burying cable in the Hudson; that they spare any harm to Indigenous or other populations and that they use well-sited wind and solar power not river-killing hydropower. [Read the letter here.]

The CHPE project raises alarms on all counts.

Riverkeeper initially negotiated an agreement with the CHPE project when it was the only proposal of its kind assuming at the time that it would be essential to replacing energy needs after the shutdown of Indian Point nuclear plant’s two nuclear reactors. That assumption was incorrect. Increased renewable energy generation and reductions in demand have already “replaced” the equivalent of one reactor and alternative sources of energy are coming online every day. In 2019 Riverkeeper withdrew our support for the project and we remain opposed.

Our concerns over the potential impacts of the CHPE project are many.

Hydropower and Indigenous communities

Hydropower is billed as “renewable.” Rain falls from the sky flows down rivers fills reservoirs and drives turbines. But as a society we need renewable energy that is also sustainable.

Massive amounts of concrete are used to build dams and concrete production is one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters worldwide. And when land is flooded to create reservoirs microbes convert naturally occurring mercury in soils into methylmercury a toxin that bioaccumulates in fish. This poisons the food web.

This Hydro-Quebec promotional video shows the extraordinary scale of these hydroelectric projects.

For Indigenous communities in eastern Canada living in close relationship with the land and fishing and hunting for food the effect is devastating. By poisoning the food web dams poison their bodies and destroy their way of life.

A 2016 Harvard study explored these human health risks and concluded that 90 percent of proposed Canadian hydroelectric projects may expose local indigenous communities to methylmercury. Reservoirs also release methane a potent greenhouse gas.

First Nations are and have been speaking out in protest. (See Quebec Hydro CLA$H Innu Nation and North American Mega Dam Resistance Alliance.) During a videoconference last year Lucien Wabanonik Elected Councilor with Lac Simon’s Band Council in Quebec was asked by an advisor to the Ramapough Lenape community in New York what message he would give New Yorkers about the impacts of hydropower.

“We have been robbed of our future of our land” he responded. “We have been robbed and ignored by governments of Quebec and Canada and of course Hydro Quebec.”

We shouldn’t pretend this is “green” energy when it causes such damage.

Hundreds of people have delivered that message to New York State. Please take a moment to visit this page and add your voice.

Hudson River impacts

To carry power 339 miles from the U.S.-Canada border to New York City the CHPE cable would be laid along 200 miles in Lake Champlain and the Hudson River using a “jet plow” a machine that uses high powered water jets to blast away sediment to create a 7-foot-deep trench. The cable is laid in the trench and covered.

One potential danger from CHPE or any other project routed through the riverbed of the Hudson is the mobilization of legacy industrial contaminants like the PCBs that were dumped by General Electric and remain in river sediment and contaminate fish. The New York State Department of Health cautions women under 50 and children not to eat fish from the Hudson due primarily to PCBs as well as other contaminants.

Churning up contaminants could pose additional risk of PCB exposure – and not just through fish. The Hudson is used as a drinking water source for seven communities in the mid-Hudson region. These “Hudson 7” communities wrote to the state Public Service Commission about its concern that sediments contaminated by PCBs and other pollutants would be churned up near their drinking water intakes and urged that the cable be routed away from the area on land instead of in the river. Bill Carlos chairman of the Poughkeepsie Joint Water Board said running the cable in the Hudson through the Hudson 7 area “represents a direct threat to every one of the 106000 people who get their drinking water from the river.”

Endangered sturgeon

Another potential danger comes from the electromagnetic fields (EMF) produced by these enormous direct-current cables. The CHPE cables would carry a level of power equivalent to one entire Indian Point reactor. There is a growing body of evidence that magnetic fields generated by in-water cables will inhibit the ability of fish to navigate and affect the behavior of various species.

Many fish especially migratory species have evolved highly refined sensory abilities to detect EMFs essential to find prey detect predators and find mates. Studies have shown that human-caused EMFs may interfere with the ability of fish to orient themselves and navigate and that they interfere with the foraging behavior of sturgeon the icon of the estuary and an endangered species.

CHPE’s developers say that there is no “proof” that EMF will reduce the survivability of Atlantic sturgeon and other species. But let’s not forget that although the Hudson supports one of the most viable remaining populations of Atlantic sturgeon the number of spawning-age females which once numbered in the thousands is now estimated in the hundreds. While New York State has celebrated the increasing number of young sturgeon found in the river the key measure – the numbers of adult sturgeon – has remained virtually unchanged in decades. Sturgeon are not recovering so the precautionary principle must apply here.

We wouldn’t know for years how sturgeon are affected by the cable because sturgeon don’t reach spawning age until they’re 18 to 20 years old. We must not use the Hudson as an experiment.

Economic factors

Cables that transmit in-state wind or solar power have the lowest impact and have the major advantage that they generate jobs and investment in New York State. Why would we favor a project that shifts energy jobs and investment to Canada?

The shipping industry has its own concern over cables being routed in the Hudson – that emergency anchoring could snag a cable once they are installed.

New York’s Tier 4 program is an important step in the State’s transition to renewable energy. Initially Riverkeeper and others opposed the Tier 4 credit process because we felt it favored Canadian hydropower but the process was approved anyway. We hope to get a good result from a flawed process.

This step should be taken in a manner that minimizes environmental impacts in New York and elsewhere. Although the first of these proposals was the Champlain Hudson Power Express six other bidders proposed solutions each of which promised to have considerably less impact.

Riverkeeper is not the only organization raising these concerns. A coalition of groups – The Sierra Club Riverkeeper Project Drawdown 350Brooklyn 350 NYC the PEAK Coalition WE ACT for Environmental Justice People’s Climate Movement New York Adirondack Council New York Communities for Change New York Energy Democracy Alliance Sane Energy Project Environmental Advocates NY and Food and Water Watch – submitted a letter to Governor Cuomo emphasizing the potential benefits of in-state generation. It calls for prioritizing economic and job-creation benefits for New Yorkers upholding labor standards respecting the rights of Indigenous people and other priorities.

Both letters from Riverkeeper and from the coalition show that the CHPE cable is the worst option for New York. There are other better options that are more deserving of public subsidies.

We are counting on New York to make the right decision.

The attack is unlikely to affect gasoline supply and prices unless it leads to a prolonged shutdown of the pipeline experts said.

Colonial Pipeline did not say what was demanded or who made the demand. Ransomware attacks are typically carried out by criminal hackers who scramble data paralyzing victim networks and demand a large payment to decrypt it.

The attack on the company which says it delivers roughly 45% of fuel consumed on the East Coast underscores again the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure to damaging cyberattacks that threaten to impede operations. It presents a new challenge for an administration still dealing with its response to major hacks from months ago including a massive breach of government agencies and corporations for which the U.S. sanctioned Russia last month.

In this case Colonial Pipeline said the ransomware attack Friday affected some of its information technology systems and that the company moved “proactively” to take certain systems offline halting pipeline operations. In an earlier statement it said it was “taking steps to understand and resolve this issue” with an eye toward returning to normal operations.

The Alpharetta Georgia-based company transports gasoline diesel jet fuel and home heating oil from refineries located on the Gulf Coast through pipelines running from Texas to New Jersey. Its pipeline system spans more than 5500 miles transporting more than 100 million gallon a day.

The White House said President Joe Biden was briefed Saturday morning and the federal government was working with the company to assess the implications of the attack restore operations and avoid disruptions to the supply. The government is planning for various scenarios and working with state and local authorities on measures to mitigate any potential supply issues.

The private cybersecurity firm FireEye said it’s been hired to manage the incident response investigation.

Oil analyst Andy Lipow said the impact of the attack on fuel supplies and prices depends on how long the pipeline is down. An outage of one day or two would be minimal he said but an outage of five or six days could cause shortages and price hikes particularly in an area stretching from central Alabama to the Washington D.C. region.

Lipow said a key concern about a lengthy delay would be the supply of jet fuel needed to keep major airports operating like those in Atlanta and Charlotte North Carolina.

A leading expert in industrial control systems Dragos CEO Robert Lee said systems such as those that directly manage the pipeline’s operation have been increasingly connected to computer networks in the past decade.

But critical infrastructure companies in the energy and electricity industries also tend to have invested more in cybersecurity than other sectors. If Colonial’s shutdown was mostly precautionary — and it detected the ransomware attack early and was well-prepared — the impact may not be great Lee said.

While there have long been fears about U.S. adversaries disrupting American energy suppliers ransomware attacks by criminal syndicates are much more common and have been soaring lately. The Justice Department has a new task force dedicated to countering ransomware attacks.

The attack “underscores the threat that ransomware poses to organizations regardless of size or sector” said Eric Goldstein executive assistant director of the cybersecurity division at the federal Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency.

“We encourage every organization to take action to strengthen their cybersecurity posture to reduce their exposure to these types of threats” Goldstein said in a statement.

Ransomware scrambles a victim organization’s data with encryption. The criminals leave instructions on infected computers for how to negotiate ransom payments and once paid provide software decryption keys.

The attacks mostly by criminal syndicates operating out of Russia and other safe havens reached epidemic proportions last year costing hospitals medical researchers private businesses state and local governments and schools tens of billions of dollars. Biden administration officials are warning of a national security threat especially after criminals began stealing data before scrambling victim networks and saying they will expose it online unless a ransom is paid.

Average ransoms paid in the United States jumped nearly threefold to more than $310000 last year. The average downtime for victims of ransomware attacks is 21 days according to the firm Coveware which helps victims respond.

U.S. law enforcement officials say some of these criminals have worked with Russia’s security services and that the Kremlin benefits by damaging adversaries’ economies. These operations also potentially provide cover for intelligence-gathering.

“Ransomware is the most common disruptive event that organizations are seeing right now that would cause them to shut down to prevent the spread” said Dave White president of cybersecurity firm Axio.

Mike Chapple teaching professor of IT analytics and operations at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business and a former computer scientist with the National Security Agency said systems that control pipelines should not be connected to the internet and vulnerable to cyber intrusions.

“The attacks were extremely sophisticated and they were able to defeat some pretty sophisticated security controls or the right degree of security controls weren’t in place” Chapple said.

Brian Bethune a professor of applied economics at Boston College also said the impact on consumer prices should be short-lived as long as the shutdown does not last for more than a week or two. “But it is an indication of how vulnerable our infrastructure is to these kinds of cyberattacks” he said.

Bethune noted the shutdown is occurring at a time when energy prices have already been rising as the economy reopens further as pandemic restrictions are lifted. According to the AAA auto club the national average for a gallon of regular gasoline has increased by 4 cents since Monday to $2.94.

Anne Neuberger the Biden administration’s deputy national security adviser for cybersecurity and emerging technology said in an interview with The Associated Press in April that the government was undertaking a new effort to help electric utilities water districts and other critical industries protect against potentially damaging cyberattacks. She said the goal was to ensure that control systems serving 50000 or more Americans have the core technology to detect and block malicious cyber activity.

Since then the White House has announced a 100-day initiative aimed at protecting the country’s electricity system from cyberattacks by encouraging owners and operators of power plants and electric utilities to improve their capabilities for identifying cyber threats to their networks. It includes concrete milestones for them to put technologies into use so they can spot and respond to intrusions in real time.

Wind Energy Capital of North America” painted across the 160-foot structure.

What You Need To Know Texas produces more wind energy than any other U.S. state.



While wind-generated energy is environmentally friendly decommissioned wind turbine blades are difficult to dispose of any thousands have piled up in landfills



New technology is being created to recycle the blades including hundreds of blades stored in fields in Sweetwater Texas

The blade stands as a symbol of the importance of the wind energy industry to this city on the edge of the Texas plains. Texas produces more wind energy than any other state in the country much of it here off of Interstate 20. If Texas was a country it would rank fifth among the world’s wind energy producers.

Sweetwater’s wind energy industry started in the late 1990s and has fueled the local economy with turbine-related jobs and a boom for landowners. Today President Joe Biden’s call for investing in America’s clean energy resources including wind fuels hopes of more opportunities to come.

But for all the benefits the wind turbines have brought to Sweetwater a critical question remains: What to do with the worn-out wind turbine blades when they are replaced?

Wind turbine blades last an average of about 25 to 30 years. When they are replaced the old blades become a challenge from transporting them out of the field to finding a place to store the blades which can be longer than a Boeing 747 wing.

Finding an environmentally friendly and economical way to dispose of the blades will become a growing problem. In the U.S. alone there are an estimated 54000 turbines in operation at the moment with 164000 blades according to Global Fiberglass Solutions. Over the next two years an estimated 35000 of those blades will be decommissioned and need somewhere to go.

Last year G.E. Renewable Energy a division of General Electric announced that it would begin recycling the blades by shredding them into raw material for use in cement manufacturing. In the Netherlands one city turned the old blades into a playground. Cork Ireland is experimenting with using retired blades to construct bridges.

Still thousands of old blades have been cut into pieces and laid to rest in landfills where the fiber-reinforced plastic will never break down. A municipal landfill outside of Casper Wyo. another wind energy hub in the U.S. has been the resting place for more than 1120 blades and the city expects to receive another 250 in the coming year.

The U.S. currently has very little regulation regarding the disposal of wind turbine blades. Adding to the problem is the fact that blades have gotten longer during the last 30 years as wind technology has advanced creating longer blades and shorter turbine towers for better energy production.

In Sweetwater two “graveyards” for retired turbine blades have appeared in recent years. Here hundreds of the football field-sized blades have been cut into thirds and laid out in pastures. The sawed edges of the blades stacked on top of each other and spread out over a 10-acre field can be seen just off Highway 70 south of Sweetwater. Another blade graveyard stretches across an industrial field across from the city’s only graveyard off of Interstate 20.

It’s a sight Sweetwater residents have grown as accustomed to as the hundreds of massive wind turbines that operate day and night on the sprawling wind farms south of the city’s quiet center.

Global Fiberglass Solutions a Washington-based company owns the two blade graveyards in Sweetwater. The company which did not return requests for interviews has said it will recycle the blades into construction-grade fiberglass pellets and panels.

Wind energy creates substantially less pollution than energy generated by fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas another important industry in Texas’ economy. While wind energy production has brought financial benefits to Texas and many see potential in furthering the development of the industry it has not stopped it from irking proponents of the state’s huge oil and gas industry.

In February when Texas was hit with the worst winter storm in a decade and the state’s power grid failed Gov. Greg Abbott was quick to falsely accuse the wind production industry of being a key cause of the rolling blackouts across the state. According to the state’s power grid wind power contributes about 20% of the total power generation while coal and natural gas-powered generation account for almost 70% and nuclear about 10%.

Figuring out a way to dispose of or repurpose decommissioned wind blades will be important for Texas if the state continues to develop its substantial share of the industry.

“I joke with my husband that we have one graveyard for relatives but two graveyards for the blades” said Abigail McLaughlin who works at a local hotel. Behind the hotel’s front desk wallpaper depicts the local landscape of wind turbines along the raised plateau."

What are Cashback Credit Cards?

The simple answer to this question is in the name: You are given cash back for purchases made on a credit card. Similarly to the way cashback websites work banks and credit card companies can be prepared to share some of their merchant fees with consumers in order to incentivise spending. These Cashback Credit Cards are popular in the United States but haven’t really been utilised so much Down Under. The launch of the American Express Cashback™ Credit Card looks as if it may change this.

Inside the American Express Cashback™ Credit Card

Amex launched its Cashback Credit Card on April 21 2021. Not only does it offer cashback on purchases but it comes with a number of other benefits outlined below! You can read more about the card on Amex’s website here.

Gary Woodland is seeking his first victory since his 2019 U.S. Open win at Pebble Beach. Getty Images

Gary Woodland is just happy to be playing without pain this week.

It’s been a long road for the 2019 U.S. Open champion who revealed that he had a torn labrum in his left hip after missing the cut at the 2020 U.S. Open at Winged Foot.

Woodland did not have surgery and instead spent most of December and January on a recovery and conditioning plan.

“We worked on strengthening everything around the hip” Woodland told Golf Channel at the American Express where he finished T16. “We were so focused on pain in the hip. I’ve been out of pain for about a month now and it’s starting to feel pretty good. My speed is back I’m able to hit shots I haven’t been able to hit in a long time.”

Despite Woodland’s optimism results didn’t follow and the pain returned. In the eight events since Woodland has only one top 10 (a T6 at the Valero Texas Open) and missed four cuts. At last week’s Valspar Championship Woodland shot 77-71 missing the cut by a wide margin at six over par.

“Last week was pretty much rock bottom for me” Woodland said after firing a second-round 69 at the Wells Fargo Championship on Friday. “Golf course that I’ve had success on won on and went out and played absolutely miserable missed the cut. Made a change went back talked to Butch on Saturday worked with him over the phone. And then Pete Cowen was in town working with Rory so Pete came down and we worked in person on Sunday. Went back to really set down and seeing what I’ve been doing the last year compared to what I was doing three four years ago when I was hitting it well. Saw the difference visually and then we kind of tried to get back to that.”

Woodland’s coaching sessions appear to be paying dividends this week. He shares a one-shot lead at the tournament’s halfway point with Matt Wallace and Patrick Rodgers and credits the changes he’s made to his swing with allowing him to play pain-free this week.

“If I was going to continue to play the way I was last week then it was probably time to shut it down this week” Woodland said. “But I’ve seen the difference why I was swinging the way I was. I’ve seen that I can go out this week — you know it’s only been five days I think since I’ve been doing this but I’m in no pain and I’m able to hit the golf ball the way I want to and if I can continue to do that I’ll be fine.

“The swing that I’ve been doing the last year is because of the hip” Woodland continued. “When the hip started acting up I had to make changes just to play which is obviously looking hindsight I wish I wouldn’t have done that but I wanted to play. That’s all I know how to do is play golf. So I worked around the hip and I got into some bad bad habits. My misses have been absolutely horrendous they’ve been off the map. So even when I have good rounds I hit a ball out of play and a big number adds up to not a good score. So Pete showed me that Butch showed me that so it was nice.”

Regardless of what happens this weekend Woodland’s performance through two rounds seems like a meaningful corner turned for the four-time PGA Tour winner.

“I’ve seen some shots this week that I just haven’t seen in a long time” Woodland said. “The golf swing feels so much better. Confidence has gone way up which I did not have really in the last year. Even when I had good rounds I haven’t been confident. I can lie to myself and tell myself I was excited to be there but I haven’t been excited to play to be honest with you for the last year. It’s nice.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZnJlcXVlbnRtaWxlci5jb20vZ2V0LTcway1hbWV4LWRlbHRhLWdvbGQtb2ZmZXItd2l0aC0yMDAtc3RhdGVtZW50LWNyZWRpdC13aGVuLW1ha2luZy1hLWR1bW15LWJvb2tpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,(Update: 70k + $200 Still Available) Get 70k Amex Delta Gold Offer With $200 Statement Credit When Making A ...,"Update 5/8/21: The best offer for the Amex Delta Gold that it’s possible to provide a direct link to dropped this past week to 40000 miles plus a $50 statement credit for restaurant purchases. However it’s still possible to get the 70000 miles plus $200 statement credit version of the offer that we wrote about below by following the instructions provided in the post.

Unfortunately the way that Delta displays the application form while making a dummy paid booking means that we’re unable to provide a direct link to the increased offer otherwise we’d add that link to our Best Offers page. The 90000 bonus SkyMiles offer while making a dummy booking appears to have expired but this 70k + $200 offer is still a solid welcome offer especially when compared to 40k + $50. The downside is that it’s only possible (as far as I’m aware) to get the 70k + $200 offer by doing a dummy booking rather than being able to generate the offer for P2 via P1’s referral link as that would be even more rewarding. Having said that it might still be possible to generate a 75k referral offer (i.e. without any statement credit) – see this post for more.

Update 3/13/21: As per Brian’s comment below some people are seeing an offer for 90000 SkyMiles rather than 70000 SkyMiles + $200.

American Express came out with a host of increased offers on its cobranded Delta credit cards last week (See Awesome new Delta offers for 70-90K miles up to 20K MQMs and more).

One of those increased offers was 70000 bonus miles on the Delta Gold card with no annual fee in the first year. Miles to Memories has noticed that it’s possible to get an even better offer which includes a $200 statement credit when making a dummy booking on Delta’s website.

Key Terms

Quick Thoughts

70000 SkyMiles with no annual fee the first year is a decent offer but having a $200 statement credit thrown into the mix makes this even more tempting if you’re eligible to earn a bonus on the card.

To get access to this offer you have to make a dummy paid booking on Delta’s website. After you’ve selected which flights you want scroll down a little and you should see this box:

As always when applying for a new card be sure to take a screenshot of what’s being offered to you. If you’d like to apply check the box in the bottom-left corner and continue through the booking process (you don’t have to actually book the flights).

When continuing the booking process a popup will appear where you complete your details and get a decision. Once again take a screenshot at this point to make sure the offer matches what you’re expecting.

Note that the $200 statement credit is only triggered when you make a Delta purchase. In the past these types of statement credits have been triggered when paying the $5.60 fee when booking an award flight so you shouldn’t need to spend $200 on Delta flights in order to earn the $200 – any kind of Delta spend should trigger it. With one-way award flights from only 2000 SkyMiles it shouldn’t be hard finding a way to earn the $200.

Another method that worked in the past to trigger these types of statement credits was to buy a Delta gift card (n.b. this type of statement credit was different to the airline fee credits on Amex Platinum cards). I’ve no idea whether or not that still works; the terms of the $200 statement credit specifically exclude Delta gift card purchases but that doesn’t necessarily mean it won’t work.

Another option which might work would be to buy a Delta gift card in the Fluz app. Delta gift card purchases in the app code as travel but I’m far from certain it’ll trigger the statement credit as the merchant category is 4722 which is ‘Travel Agencies and Tour Operators’. The transaction would likely appear on your statement as something like ‘BT*FLUZAPP*DELTA NEW YORK NY’ which might be enough to trigger the statement credit seeing as Delta is mentioned. However with a minimum transaction amount of $50 for Delta gift cards in the Fluz app the gift card exclusion already mentioned and no data points to support that it’ll work this option isn’t ideal.

As a result paying $5.60 to earn $200 will likely be the easiest option for most people if you don’t have any other plans to spend anything with Delta in the next three months. Delta’s flexible cancellation policy is another option but with this being Amex then there’s the potential for a clawback of the statement credit if your Delta payment is reversed in the future.

Amex will dish out holders of its Preferred Rewards Gold credit card £10 every month when ordering from Deliveroo.

Cardholders will be able to receive up to £5 twice each month for Deliveroo purchases charged to the card.

New and existing American Express Preferred Rewards Gold cardmembers can tuck into an exclusive new benefit with Deliveroo.

To take advantage Gold cardmembers simply need to enrol by saving it to their card via the Amex app or their online account by 6 May 2023.

This means that over the course of a year a cardholder could receive up to £120 cashback based on their Deliveroo purchases alone.

The boost to its Gold reward card came hours after the card provider announcing it will be slashing the amounts customers will earn using its cashback credit cards.

From 4 August cashback rates will be cut by as much as 50 per cent in some cases.

The cashback cuts relate to its free Platinum Cashback Everyday Card and its Platinum Cashback Card which comes with a £25 annual fee.

Its free customers currently receive 1 per cent cashback when spending more than £5000 annually but under the changes any spending up to £10000 will only earn 0.5 per cent.

Paying card holders will earn 0.75 per cent cashback on spending up to £10000 down from the current rate of 1 per cent.

The new Deliveroo perk may sway some of its cashback cardmembers as well as new joiners to seriously consider Amex's Preferred Rewards Gold Credit Card.

How do the Amex credit card cashback changes stack up? Card Old cashback on £5000 New cashback on £5000 Old cashback on £10000 New cashback on £10000 Old cashback on £20000 New cashback on £20000 Platinum Cashback £25 £12.50 £75 £50 £200 £175 Platinum Cashback Everyday £25 £25 £75 £50 £175 £150 Santander All in One Mastercard N/A £-11 N/A £14 N/A £36 Barclaycard Rewards credit card N/A £12.50 N/A £25 N/A £50 Source: This is Money/Head for Points (figures are net including fees)

The Deliveroo offer compliments a host of other benefits that come with the gold card such as global lounge access and travel inconvenience insurance.

It is also already one of the best when it comes to rewarding spending doing so in the form of American Express points.

These points can be converted into airline air miles hotel points or retail gift cards through Amex itself.

As a result it is the top pick in This is Money's guide to the best credit cards around - but you must play by the rules and pay off your balances as you go along because of the chunky interest it charges.

It comes with a 22.2 per cent rate on purchases but a representative APR of 56.6 per cent thanks to an annual fee of £140 due after the first year.

New card members can also earn 20000 points if they spend £3000 within the first three months which is enough for a £100 gift card from Amazon.

'Amex has been proactive in seeking out new ways to offer benefits to cardholders at a time when its more traditional perks centred around airport lounges dining out and events have been harder to take advantage of' said Chris Lilly credit specialist at the personal finance comparison site Finder.

'The Deliveroo offer reaffirms that Amex is always on the hunt for diverse sweeteners to help retain existing customers and entice new ones at the same time.

'This is a card that's suited to people who will use it frequently and really engage with all the perks the card can offer but won't carry a balance from month to month – instead always paying their monthly bill off in full.

This is a card that's suited to people who will use it frequently and really engage with all the perks the card can offer but won't carry a balance from month to month. Chris Lilly Finder

'Those who do carry a balance from month to month stand a good chance of paying more in interest and fees than they earn in rewards.'

Should you apply?

Choosing the best credit card like with many things boils down to whether the benefits on offer are best suited to your circumstances.

It may be that you are looking for a card to clear debt – and in that case a balance transfer credit card might work best.

This allows customers to pay off debts by transferring the entire debt over to the new card often with the promise of 0 per cent interest for a fixed period of time.

Or equally you may be optimistic that with the vaccine rollout in full swing you'll soon be making up for lost time by holidaying abroad and therefore require a credit card best suited to overseas spending.

But if you decide a rewards credit card is for you then a lot will depend on how much money you spend and how you spend it.

For example there are cards geared towards flyers supermarket spenders and fitness fanatics.

'The most suitable reward card will depend on how someone spends their money so if they are in a habit of using their credit card it may be worth taking a step back and taking a look at the different retailers that form their spending pattern' said Rachel Springall finance expert at Moneyfacts.

The Amex Gold card is our top pick for rewards but beware of the £140 fee after year one

'At this stage consider the current reward or cashback cards available to see if they could be taking advantage of a scheme instead by using that credit card for spending.

'However its important spenders clear their balance before interest applies as this could wipe out any benefits.'

A major issue for those considering Amex's Gold card is the £140 annual fee that you will begin paying after the first year.

For those looking for cheaper reward or cashback card there are other options out there.

'Putting aside the ultra-elite charge and credit cards on the market the Preferred Rewards Gold card offers perhaps the most diverse and engaging perks scheme around' said Lilly.

'For those who can't stomach the fee Amex offers alternatives such as the Platinum Cashback Everyday Card.

'Whilst for those hoping to finally holiday abroad in the coming months Santander's All in One offers cashback plus fee-free currency conversion could be a great alternative.'

As protesters take to the streets to fight for racial equality in the United States experts in digital technology are quietly tackling a lesser known but related injustice.

It’s called techno-racism. And while you may not have heard of it it’s baked into some of the technology we encounter every day.

Digital technologies used by government agencies and private companies can unwittingly discriminate against people of color making techno-racism a new and crucial part of the battle for civil rights experts say.

“It’s not just the physical streets. Black folks now have to fight the civil rights fight on the virtual streets in those algorithmic streets in those internet streets” says W. Kamau Bell host of the CNN original series “United Shades of America.” Bell explores this digitized form of racism in tonight’s episode which focuses on the role of race in science tech and related fields.

We talked to some experts to gain a deeper understanding of what techno-racism is and what you can do about it.

What’s techno-racism?

Techno-racism describes a phenomenon in which the racism experienced by people of color is encoded in the technical systems used in our everyday lives says Mutale Nkonde founder of AI For the People a nonprofit that educates Black communities about artificial intelligence and social justice.

The term dates back at least to 2019 when a member of a Detroit civilian police commission used it to describe glitchy facial recognition systems that confused Black faces.

It gained new traction last year as the title of a webinar with Tendayi Achiume a UN special rapporteur on racism based on a report she wrote. Achiume and other experts argue that digital technologies can implicitly or explicitly exacerbate existing biases about race ethnicity and national origin.

“Even when tech developers and users do not intend for tech to discriminate it often does so anyway” Achiume told the UN Human Rights Council last year. “Technology is not neutral or objective. It is fundamentally shaped by the racial ethnic gender and other inequalities prevalent in society and typically makes these inequalities worse.”

Or in other words as Bell says in Sunday’s “United Shades” episode:

“Feed a bunch of racist data collected from a long racist history … and what you get is a racist system that treats the racism that’s put into it as the truth.”

So facial recognition systems are an example of it?

Yes they can be.

Facial recognition technology uses software to identify people by matching images such as faces in a surveillance video with mug shots in a database. It’s a major resource for police departments searching for suspects.

But research has shown that some facial analysis algorithms misidentify Black people an issue explored in the Netflix documentary “Coded Bias.” The American Civil Liberties Union describes facial surveillance “as the most dangerous of the many new technologies available to law enforcement” because it can be racially biased.

Police used an image of the suspect taken from a fake driver's license left at the scene (left) to run a facial recognition scan. It returned a ""high profile comparison"" to Nijeer Parks (right). Woodbridge Police Department

“Although the accuracy of facial recognition technology has increased dramatically in recent years differences in performance exist for certain demographic groups” the United States Government Accountability Office wrote in a report to Congress last year. For example federal testing found facial recognition technology generally performed better when applied to men with lighter skin and worse on darker-skinned women.

A false facial recognition match even sent a New Jersey man to jail for crimes he didn’t commit. Nijeer Parks who is Black spent 11 days behind bars in 2019 after the technology mistakenly matched him with a fake ID left at a crime scene. The match was enough for prosecutors and a judge to sign off on a warrant for Parks’ arrest.

In a similar case Detroit police in January 2020 arrested Robert Williams outside his suburban home based on a bad facial recognition match. Williams who also is Black spent 30 hours in jail before his name was cleared.

“I never thought I’d have to explain to my daughters why Daddy got arrested” Williams wrote in a column for The Washington Post. “How does one explain to two little girls that a computer got it wrong but the police listened to it anyway?”

A study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology of over 100 facial recognition algorithms found that they falsely identified African American and Asian faces 10 to 100 times more than Caucasian faces.

Some police departments government agencies and facial recognition vendors are now cautioning that facial recognition matches should be used only as investigative tools not as evidence.

What are some other examples of techno-racism?

Unemployment fraud systems

Some states are using facial recognition to reduce fraud when processing unemployment benefits. Applicants are asked to upload verification documentation including a photo and their images are matched against a database to verify their identity.

“This sounds great but commercial facial recognition technologies used by Amazon IBM and Microsoft have been found to be 40% inaccurate when identifying Black people” Nkonde said.

“So this will lead to Black people being more likely to be misidentified as attempting to commit fraud potentially criminalizing them.”

Risk assessment tools

One such tool is the mortgage algorithms used by online lenders to determine rates for loan applicants.

These algorithms are still using flawed historical data from a period when Black people could not own property Nkonde said.

In 2019 a study by UC Berkeley researchers found that mortgage algorithms show the same bias to Black and Latino borrowers as human loan officers. It found that bias costs people of color up to half a billion dollars more in interest every year than their White counterparts.

The passage of the Federal Fair Housing Act in 1968 which prohibited discrimination based on things such as race and national origin has not stamped out racism in that industry Nkonde said. The Department of Housing and Urban Development sued Facebook in 2019 accusing it of targeting housing ads on the platform to select audiences based on race gender and politics.

Finance professor Adair Morse co-author of the UC Berkeley study said that discrimination in lending has shifted from human bias to algorithmic bias.

“Even if the people writing the algorithms intend to create a fair system their programming is having a disparate impact on minority borrowers — in other words discriminating under the law” she said.

Are tech companies doing anything about it?

Last year Amazon announced it would temporarily stop providing its facial recognition technology to police forces as part of a commitment to fighting systemic racism. So did Microsoft.

IBM also canceled its facial recognition programs and called for an urgent debate on whether the technology should be used in law enforcement.

Nonprofits such as AI for People are working with Black communities to educate them on how technologies are used in modern life. It produced a film with Amnesty International as part of the rights group’s Ban the Scan campaign.

How else can we fight techno-racism?

When technology reflects biases in the real world it leads to discrimination and unequal treatment in all areas of life. That includes employment home ownership and criminal justice among others.

One way to combat that is to train and hire more Black professionals in the American technology sector Nkonde said.

She also said voters must demand that elected officials pass laws regulating the use of algorithmic technologies.

In 2019 federal lawmakers introduced the Algorithmic Accountability Act which requires companies to review and fix computer algorithms that lead to inaccurate unfair or discriminatory decisions.

“Computers are increasingly involved in the most important decisions affecting Americans’ lives – whether or not someone can buy a home get a job or even go to jail” said Sen. Ron Wyden one of the sponsors of the bill. “But instead of eliminating bias too often these algorithms depend on biased assumptions or data that can actually reinforce discrimination against women and people of color.”

It’s time to be more skeptical about Silicon Valley and the supposed benefits of technology said Christiaan van Veen director of the Digital Welfare State and Human Rights Project which was established at NYU law school to research digitalization’s impact on the human rights of marginalized groups.

“It’s good to remember that digital technologies and digital systems are still built with human involvement not imposed on us by some nonhuman entity” he said. “Like with other expressions of racism the fight against techno-racism will need to be multipronged and will likely never end.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMTYvd29ybGQvYXNpYS9pbnRlcnByZXRlci1hZmdoYW5pc3Rhbi13YXIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Contradiction That Doomed America's Mission in Afghanistan (Published 2021),"It took barely two months after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001 for the United States mission to point itself toward defeat.

Aiaska Airlines is the newest member of the Oneworld airline alliance formally joining in March.

Flyers will notice better connecting options and increased cooperation between member airlines.

Frequent Alaska flyers benefit the most with elite status carrying over to 13 other carriers.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Alaska Airlines in March became the 14th and newest member of the Oneworld airline alliance joining the likes of American Airlines Qatar Airways British Airways in the global partnership.

Airline alliances are built on the premise that not a group of carriers can better connect the world than just one can. Each of America's three largest international airlines belongs to an airline alliance but the Oneworld alliance is now the only one to include two American carriers: American and Alaska.

By partnering alliances can also offer flyers greater conveniences when flying on member carriers like complementary route networks and single-ticket itineraries across multiple airlines. Elite status holders can also benefit by having greater access to upgrades and airport amenities like priority check-in.

Here's how Alaska flyers can benefit when flying on the new Oneworld partner airlines and how Oneworld flyers can benefit when flying Alaska.

Earning miles on more airlines

Members of Alaska's Mileage Plan program can now earn miles when flying on any one of Oneworld's 14 member airlines. Besides Alaska that list includes American British Airways Qatar Airways Cathay Pacific Airways Finnair Qantas Malaysia Airlines Japan Airlines Iberia Royal Air Maroc Royal Jordanian Airlines S7 Airlines and SriLankan Airlines.

And the same goes when loyalists of other Oneworld airlines fly on Alaska as they can earn miles for their preferred airline's program. The offering gives flyers greater flexibility to fly different airlines especially if one has a better schedule or doesn't serve a desired route while still earning miles that can lead to free flights or elite status.

Alaska flyers wanting to travel outside of Alaska's route network can do so easier now that the airline has 13 partners around the world. Oneworld airlines will be tasked with bringing Alaska's flyers where the Seattle-based airline cannot.

Flying to Europe? British Airways Finnair and Iberia can help with that. Canada Latin America and the Caribbean? American Airlines will be helpful there. Africa and the Middle East? Qatar Airways Royal Jordanian and Royal Air Maroc have a strong network there. Asia? Cathay Pacific Airways and SirLankan Airlines are good bets. Russia? S7 Airlines can help with internal flights.

A flyer wanting to go from Portland Oregon to Doha Qatar can book a single-ticket itinerary through Alaska that includes flights on Alaska and Qatar Airways. Amman Jordan is an easy Alaska flight to New York to meet the non-stop Royal Jordanian flight.

Single-ticket itineraries also mean baggage is automatically brought to the next flight even if on a different airline and fees are only paid once.

More upgrades for frequent flyers

Alaska flyers with MVP 75K status only are eligible for complimentary upgrades on American when flying domestically or between the US Canada Mexico the Caribbean and Central America. Later this year those status holders will also be given certificates to upgrade on American's international flights.







All Alaska elite status holders regardless of rank will be allowed to select American's ""Main Cabin Extra"" seats if available for no extra charge. MVP status holders can do so 24 hours in advance while higher ranks can do so at booking.

American flyers with Executive Platinum status only are eligible for complimentary upgrades on Alaska and will be automatically placed on the upgrade list. The only exception is when Executive Platinum holders book ""saver"" fares on Alaska the equivalent of basic economy.

All Alaska elite status holders regardless of rank will be allowed to select Alaska's ""premium cabin"" seats if available for no extra charge. Gold status holders with certain ticket types can choose the seats 48 hours from departure while higher ranks can do so sooner.

Upgrades on either airline are not guaranteed but are a huge incentive to keep booking higher-priced fares on each airline.

Becoming an elite status holder on Alaska also makes you an elite status holder in Oneworld and that means more perks when traveling across the alliance's network even if not on Alaska.

An Alaska MVP status holder is automatically given Oneworld Ruby status which includes access to business class check-in lines preferred and pre-reserved seating and priority on waitlists and standby lists. MVP Gold status holders on Alaska are Oneworld Sapphire meaning they get all the Ruby perks and more including access to business class lounges priority boarding extra baggage allowance and priority baggage handling.

American Airlines is facing numerous setbacks in South America.

Rising COVID-19 cases in Chile Brazil and Peru forced the airline to cut flights in April.

Civil unrest and protests in Colombia are now further threatening success in the region.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

American Airlines' expansion strategy in South America is experiencing a seemingly never-ending stream of hurdles.

Tourism-dependent Latin America was among the first regions to welcome US tourists during the coronavirus pandemic and American was standing ready to fly eager travelers. Earlier in the year the airline had announced new flights to cities in Chile Colombia and Brazil in a bid to attract leisure flyers as it waited for business travel to recover.

But while the continent appeared to be welcoming at first doing business in South America quickly proved problematic.

Flights to Santiago Chile were among the first to be impacted when the country closed its borders for the month of April. American had planned to launch a new non-stop route from New York using one of its largest aircraft the Boeing 777-200 on May 7.

Chile appeared promising when it opened to Americans in November 2020. But a spike in COVID-19 cases following the country's summer season prompted the government to once again close its borders to tourists.

The state of emergency in the country planned for the month of April has now been extended through June according to the US Embassy in Chile. American as a result pushed back the launch of its inaugural New York-Santiago flight to July 2; though Chile may extend its border closure depending on conditions in the country.

Spiking COVID-19 cases were also the reasoning for flight reductions to Brazil and Peru the airline confirmed to Insider's Brittany Chang in April. Both countries still allow US citizens to enter despite the rise in cases according to the US Embassies in Brazil and Peru.

In Colombia however American faces a new challenge: civil unrest. Protests have gripped the country with some turning violent and taking the lives of at least 26 people according to ABC News. The Washington Post Editorial Board is also predicting that Colombia's levels of unrest could spread to regional countries like Peru.

American in response has issued a travel alert for the Colombian city of Cali where the protests have been the most extreme allowing travelers to change their flight to any day between May 4 and May 18.

The protests could discourage future travelers from booking trips to Colombia or encourage flyers with existing bookings to change away from Colombia at a time when American is deploying some of its largest aircraft to the country.

Rebuilding a lost South American network at the wrong time

American's desire to grow in South American comes as the airline seeks to rebuild following the loss of a partner in LATAM Airlines prior to the pandemic.

Delta Air Lines spent $1.9 billion in 2019 for a 20 percent stake in LATAM significantly growing its presence in South America. The move saw LATAM drop American and the Oneworld airline alliance to join Delta and the SkyTeam airline alliance leaving American to rebuild in a historically profitable region.







""Latin America has for roughly 30 years now been one of American's international beachhead"" Henry Harteveldt travel analyst and cofounder of Atmosphere Research Group told Insider. ""In fact it's been American's most successful region outside of the US.""

With LATAM gone American was left with Brazil's GOL Linhas Aéreas a limited partner in the region. But GOL didn't have the reach of the larger airlines that were now aligned with American's competitors.

Delta bought a new partner in LATAM Airlines alongside its existing partner in Aerolíneas Argentinas while United had Avianca and Copa Airlines. To regrow its South American network American chose to launch new routes from the US with a domestic partner JetBlue Airways.

American launched its routes to Colombia Brazil and Chile in a partnership with JetBlue dubbed the ""Northeast Alliance."" For American the partnership provides access to customers across JetBlue's network that can connect onto the new routes.

""It's understandable that American would be eager to start rebuilding its network in Latin America because it is so strategically important to the airline right now"" Harteveldt said.

Ceding Europe to United and Delta for now

South America isn't totally lost for American as the airline still operates around 30 daily flights to cities across the continent. Cirium data also shows a steady stream of cargo-only flights operating to Santiago from Miami in 2021 which Harteveldt says helps stem the losses.

But while American focuses on South America its competitors are locked in on the reopening European continent. United and Delta were both quick to resume flights to European countries open to Americans like Greece and Iceland while also starting new routes to Croatia.

""I think American is looking at this and saying 'we're going to be very careful about which routes we pick and which battles want to fight'"" Harteveldt said thinking back to 2018 when American launched Iceland flights alongside Icelandair now-defunct Wow Air with flights to Dallas. But the airline hasn't completely ignored Europe nor a gradually reopening Middle East.

A new route between New York and Athens Greece is scheduled to launch on June 2 and existing routes to Athens from Chicago and Philadelphia will resume in June and August respectively. The airline also just launched a new route between New York and Tel Aviv Israel with plans for another route to Israel from Miami which may pay off as the Middle Eastern country starts to accept vaccinated tour groups.

American may also be waiting for the European Union to open its doors to US citizens Harteveldt says so the airline can fly more passengers on its traditional routes to cities like Paris France; Madrid Spain; and Rome Italy.

All 12 competitors put their hearts into every run but veteran Meagan Martin was in her element in a way we haven’t seen in quite a few years. She cleared the Qualifying course hitting her first buzzer since season eight. Meagan cleared the 10-obstacle course next a huge accomplishment. In the Power Tower playoffs she trusted her skills soundly winning her match against Mady Howard.

But to get to the $50000 Meagan would have to face Jesse Labreck on the Power Tower. Jesse was nearly unstoppable on the course all of season 12 and this special episode was no different. When Jesse tore off for a fast lead on the Power Tower we thought it was over. But Meagan didn’t let the gap get to her. By pushing herself and making a bold final move she found herself with her hand on the buzzer before Jesse.

You can find a full recap of the episode here.

Meagan Martin is our 2021 American Ninja Warrior Women’s Champion.

What makes this accomplishment even more impressive? This was all recorded in ONE day. Meagan ran two courses (that’s 16 obstacles) and two Power Tower races in the span of several hours.

We couldn’t have picked a more deserving competitor. Her work over the years has shaped expectations for women on the show. She’s inspired so many others to start their own Ninja journeys.

We had a chance to speak with her just one day after her triumphant success. Read on to find out how she mentally handled the competition and what it means for the seven-time competitor.

How do you physically feel right now after running all of those courses in that one day?

MM: I think I’m most sore in my glutes from the Spider Trap especially because I was in there for a while because the top was pretty slippery and those doors are really heavy. But everything else is feeling a lot better. I made sure to move a bit yesterday but we’ll see once I start warming up but it was a lot of obstacles and races in one day.

I was watching you during the course walkthrough and rules. You were like a mama hen. Every time you noticed something on the course you stopped and explained it to all the other women. What were you feeling in that group of women beforehand?

MM: I mean honestly it was just so nice for us to all be together because for the most part we only get that when we’re in Vegas (for National Finals). So it was nice to be going through everything together and yeah I just wanted it to be a fair playing field for everyone. So if I was noticing something I just wanted to make sure we all knew what was happening. I feel like we all want to help each other out so I was happy to do so.

How were you feeling that day? Your presence was so much more relaxed than I’ve seen you before honestly.

MM: You know I think it got more relaxed after I hit that first buzzer. I think that the fact that I haven’t been hitting buzzers in a bit had really gotten to my head. To a point where it was overwhelming and made me so nervous and then I would just keep messing up. So just getting that out of the way I feel made me more relaxed and also just... I’ve known these women for quite a few years now and I felt really comfortable and supported by them. And I think that really made it more fun and it made it feel lighter as well. I definitely felt more relaxed and was having way more fun.

What was going through your mind when you realized you were at the Spider Trap and you were going to take on the full 10 obstacles?

MM: When I got to the Spider Trap all I could think was I have to do this. I am not giving up. I can’t give up here. All you have to do in that obstacle is just fight as hard as you can. For the most part there’s nothing too finicky other than I guess the slipping a little bit but compared to the other obstacles it’s really just about fighting. And so I just had to make sure I finished. I could not let that slip through my fingertips. I just had to. So I was psyched I was able to pull it off.

What were your impressions of the Power Tower because I can’t even look at that thing without getting anxious.

MM: I was so intimidated by the Power Tower. It’s funny because when they did the demo I asked if the women who demo-ed could stop after the first steps once they got to the top of the platform because I wanted to see how they did that and then be able to come around the side. I really had no idea how the Power Tower was working. And it’s overwhelmingly tall and it’s all about speed. It really took me back to Ninja vs. Ninja that feeling of “Oh you’re on a start line and you have to explode and everything’s happening so fast.” So you really have to have a plan in place. After the first one (race) I felt a little better just having been on it but yeah it’s pretty intimidating.

What was your game plan for your championship round with Jesse Lebreck?

MM: My plan was just to try and move as quickly as I could. I knew that she would be really fast. She’s super strong super explosive. She’s so fierce. I just knew I was going to have to lay it all out there in order to have a shot. And the other thing I really planned on was no matter if she is ahead of me at one point it doesn’t matter. Just keep running and keep trying to catch up if that happens because it’s not over till it’s over. Basically that is what happened. I was able to somehow catch up and then get past and hit that buzzer. So I’m glad I had that plan of just sticking with it until the very very end.

What does it mean to you that you hold the title of American Ninja Warrior’s first female champion?

MM: It’s honestly such an honor. These women are so strong and it’s just crazy how much the women have progressed in the seven years I’ve been on this show. I couldn’t think of a better stronger more supportive and amazing group of women to be competing with. So it definitely means so much to me. And I’m so excited I got to experience it with all of them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWVyaWNhbm5pbmphd2Fycmlvcm5hdGlvbi5jb20vMjAyMS81LzkvMjE2NzcyNzQvYW1lcmljYW4tbmluamEtd2Fycmlvci0yMDIxLXdvbWVucy1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtcmVjYXAtd2lubmVyLXJlc3VsdHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Recap: Who won the American Ninja Warrior Women’s Championship?,"Oh we have waited SO long to be able to celebrate American Ninja Warrior’s first-ever Women’s Champion!

Sideways

Warped Wall

Ashley McConville: After hitting her first buzzer in season 12 Qualifiers Ashley was ready for more. Her smooth run across Burn Rubber came to an end on Sideways.

Result: Out on Sideways

Sandy Zimmerman: Ninja Warrior is a family affair for the first mom to hit a buzzer making it fitting that Sandy was competing on her 22nd wedding anniversary. While chatting with the women on the sideline Sandy calmly handled the course to earn another buzzer.

Result: Complete

Michelle Warnky Buurma: As the second woman to defeat the Warped Wall and the second woman to complete a City Finals course Michelle was the inspiration for many of these female competitors. The Ninja Warrior icon ended her run on Beehive.

Result: Out on Beehive

Tiana Webberley: Tiana was riding high after her first buzzer in the regular season and she was flying through the course. She tumbled off Burn Rubber and had a scary transfer on the end of Sideways. But Sweet T got it done and nabbed another buzzer!

Result: Complete

Okay we got a little freaked out on Sideways there but congrats to @SweetTee_02 on that sweet buzzer! #AmericanNinjaWarrior pic.twitter.com/PTYNpfr4r7 — Ninja Warrior Nation (@anwnation) May 9 2021

Jeri D’Aurelio: Jeri ended her run on Beehive.

Result: Out on Beehive

Mady Howard: Mady also joined the buzzer club in season 12 and she looked comfortable and confident on the course. She hit the buzzer with the fastest time to this point.

Result: Complete

Meagan Martin: Meagan was newly engaged when this special was recorded and her beaming fiancé was on the virtual sideline. She missed out on any buzzers in season 12 but dodged a repeat of her fall on Burn Rubber. Meagan cracked a smile on Sideways. She knew she had this in the bag. Meagan broke down in tears as she hit her first buzzer since season eight.

Result: Complete

Once @MeaganMartin89 cracked a smile on Sideways we knew she was going to end that drought. :) #AmericanNinjaWarrior pic.twitter.com/TAAmt1l0I4 — Ninja Warrior Nation (@anwnation) May 9 2021

Rachael Goldstein: The member of the Fantastic Four took a season away to become a mom. This run ended with a bad fall on Beehive.

Result: Out on Beehive

Allyssa Beird: Allyssa is still only the second woman to clear Stage One of the National Finals. She scored another buzzer in the Qualifiers of season 12 but this time around she was out on Sideways.

Result: Out on Sideways

Jessie Graff: Jessie worked on the latest Wonder Woman film as a stunt professional. The film’s director Patty Jenkins actually tuned in to be on her virtual sideline! If Jessie wanted to make a good impression on her boss she knocked it out of the park when she hit the buzzer.

Result: Complete

We think @JESSIEgraffPWR might have made a good impression on her boss @PattyJenks with that run. #AmericanNinjaWarrior pic.twitter.com/MmqOO8Q4iR — Ninja Warrior Nation (@anwnation) May 9 2021

Zhanique Lovett: Unfortunately Zhanique joined the group of Ninjas who didn’t survive Beehive.

Result: Out on Beehive

Jesse Labreck: Jesse’s season 12 was pretty darn spectacular. She hit her sixth regular-season buzzer. She made the top eight and she earned her second extended course buzzer. But Jesse had us terrified with this latest run. She looked nervous on Burn Rubber. Her strategy on Sideways was slightly off leading her to actually fall on the last board. In a miraculous moment she pitched herself towards the landing pad and the wall at the end of the obstacle spun her towards safety instead of the water. Using that rush of relief Jesse sprinted up the Warped Wall to safety and success.

Result: Complete

Do we ever get tired of seeing @flexlabreck hit buzzers? That's a nope. #AmericanNinjaWarrior pic.twitter.com/E9PTvw9tQI — Ninja Warrior Nation (@anwnation) May 9 2021

With that the six Ninjas who hit buzzers moved on to the extended course.

Round Two

The course

Shrinking Steps

Off the Hook

Beehive

Burn Rubber

Sideways

Warped Wall

Salmon Ladder

Corkscrew

The Dungeon

Spider Trap

Mady Howard: Mady is such a pro on the course that it’s easy to forget this is only her second season. Proving that point she made it all the way to obstacle nine before her grip gave out.

Result: Out on The Dungeon

Sandy Zimmerman: We joined Sandy’s run just before she flexed her way up the Warped Wall. The Corkscrew tested her ability to hang on but the exhaustion finally trapped her in The Dungeon.

Result: Out on The Dungeon

Jesse Labreck: Jesse wanted that prize money to make her pool dreams come true. After a much less scary journey across Sideways Jesse dug into the back half. She was the first of the night to traverse The Dungeon. But what was left of her energy? The Spider Trap was a nail-biter for her and the viewers. She looked worried. She looked exhausted. It looked like her feet were sliding. But she was slowly making progress and moving those doors. It was bitter pill for all of us to swallow when she tumbled to the safety mat.

Result: Out on Spider Trap

Meagan Martin: Meagan was able to smile about her risky landing on Burn Rubber. That moment set the tone for the rest of her incredible run. Her rock climbing grip put Corkscrew behind her. In The Dungeon she looked... Great. Strong and confident! With her power on full display she pumped her way up the Spider Trap and earned her first extended course buzzer.

Result: Complete

.@MeaganMartin89 is on FIRE tonight and we love every second of it! #AmericanNinjaWarrior pic.twitter.com/MNdTv0qn8T — Ninja Warrior Nation (@anwnation) May 10 2021

Tiana Webberley: Tiana made quick work of the Salmon Ladder and survived Corkscrew which officially bumped Sandy out of the top four. She tried to make a beeline for the end of The Dungeon before her hands gave way but she wasn’t quite able to make it there.

Result: Out on The Dungeon

Jessie Graff: This was probably the most shocking run of the night and not for great reasons. It looked like Jessie started second-guessing her hand placement on the middle slider of Sideways causing her to sway in circles. That peeled her off the obstacle and sent Mady Howard to the final round.

Result: Out on Sideways

Meagan Martin vs Mady Howard

Jesse Labreck vs Tiana Webberley

Meagan Martin vs Mady Howard

It was the veteran versus the young gun and experience paid off. After a close start Meagan showed zero hesitation with any of her big moves creating a lead. Mady stayed in the running but Meagan had this win in the bag.

Winner: Meagan Martin

Jesse Labreck vs Tiana Webberley

This was a battle! With no clear lead at the start and matching one another move for move it could have gone either way. Jesse edged out the win in the end.

Winner: Jesse Labreck

Championship match: Meagan Martin vs Jesse Labreck

With these two competitors and $50000 on the line we knew this was going to be good. But we didn’t know how good. Jesse had a strong lead heading up the steps. Her lead maintained as she traversed the Dropping Shelves. It looked like Jesse had it until Meagan once again trusted her big moves and started almost linking leaps. The result was Meagan coming from behind for the win with both her and Jesse looking a bit bewildered about the outcome.

Richard Arnold United’s group managing director was told on Friday that THG had pulled out of a contract which was due to start on 1 July.

The branding of Myprotein a Cheshire firm owned by THG was due to appear on United’s training kit and replace the branding of AON sponsors of the club’s Carrington training centre.

Last Sunday’s supporter protest against the Glazers outside Old Trafford led to United’s game with Liverpool being postponed until the coming Thursday. THG it is understood was taken aback by the subsequent social media and online backlash against United’s partners.

An anonymous United fans group with the hashtag NOTAPENNYMORE launched an online campaign to boycott the club’s major partners which include Adidas TAG Heuer and Cadbury and wrote an open letter to them vowing to target their products.

It is understood THG a multibillion pound company with offices near Manchester Airport was concerned that as a local business it would be targeted by disaffected fans in Greater Manchester.

AON’s agreement expires on 30 June which means United may struggle to strike a new deal of similar value to that proposed with THG.

The Glazers’ move to join the now defunct European Super League heightened the supporter opposition towards the American family. There was also some disillusionment and embarrassment within the club at senior level about how the ESL breakaway was presented.

The Glazers have recently been targeted by United supporters over the club's failed bid to join the now defunct European Super League.

The fans expressed their frustration at the American owners by storming Old Trafford ahead of United's clash with Liverpool.

Hundreds of fans protested outside the stadium while a select few even made their way into the stadium.

As a result Manchester United's Premier League fixture against the Reds was postponed.

THG were allegedly alarmed by the subsequent backlash against Manchester United's partners on social media.

An anonymous group took to Twitter to call for a boycott of the club's major partners - Adidas TAG Heuer and Cadbury - using the hashtag NOTAPENNYMORE.

Having seen the campaign on social media THG were worried they would be targeted by fans in Greater Manchester.

Therefore the multibillion pound company - who are located near Manchester Airport - pulled out of the deal.

The decision will come as a blow to United - who will see their contract with AON expire on 30 June.

They were due to replace AON with the words MyProtein a firm owned by THG on the tops in a ten-year deal.

They issued an open letter to all the commercial partners claiming their products would be targeted causing The Hut Group to pull out.

This has happened a week after protests at Old Trafford and the club’s Lowry hotel base forced their home game against Liverpool to be postponed.

There was already a huge dissatisfaction with the owning Glazer family - who have cost the club £1.5billion in servicing the debt they lumbered the club within their 2005 takeover.

They had not engaged with fans in their sixteen years in charge. Co-chairman Avram Glazer has not been to Old Trafford in four years while Joel Glazer has not been for two.

This week Joel Glazer tried to placate fans with statements and letters promising to right the wrongs of the past by engaging more.

But they have received a lukewarm reception from the Manchester United Supporters' Trust who want fans to have a shareholding in the club and a say on important matters.

What you need to know

Apple announced a new Developer Academy coming to Detroit back in January.

It will open later this year and serve to empower young Black entrepreneurs creators and coders.

A new report says the academy will occupy the First National Building in the downtown area.

A new report states Apple's Detroit Developer Academy will be housed in the First National Building in the downtown area of the city.

From Crains:

The Apple Developer Academy is going into Dan Gilbert's 850000-square-foot First National Building in downtown Detroit. The Apple Inc. and Michigan State University developer training hub will be located in Dan Gilbert's First National Building in downtown Detroit Crain's has learned. A building permit application filed with the city in early April and obtained by Crain's on Friday morning identifies a project in the building at 660 Woodward Ave. as a ""developers academy"" and names Anthony Rhodes a Michigan State University project manager as a contact for the occupant. The permit says the project is on the second and third floors of the building and encompasses some 37000 square feet.

Apple announced its first-ever US Developer Academy back in January stating in a press release:

Later this year Apple will open an Apple Developer Academy in Detroit — the first of its kind in the US. Detroit has a vibrant Black entrepreneur and developer community with over 50000 Black-owned businesses according to US Census data. The academy is designed to empower young Black entrepreneurs creators and coders helping them cultivate the skills necessary for jobs in the rapidly growing iOS app economy. Launched in collaboration with Michigan State University Apple Developer Academy courses will be open to all learners across Detroit regardless of their academic background or whether they have any previous coding experience.

The academy will offer a 30-day introductory program for learners considering a career in the app economy as well as a 10-12 month program to help aspiring developers hone their skills.

ADVERTISEMENT

Apple announced on Friday that it's delaying its plan to scan US iPhones for images of child sexual abuse saying it needs more time to refine the system before releasing it.

The company revealed last month that it was working on a tool to detect known images of child sexual abuse which would work by scanning files before they're uploaded to iCloud. It had also planned to introduce a separate tool to scan users’ encrypted messages for sexually explicit content.

""Based on feedback from customers advocacy groups researchers and others we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features"" Apple said in an update.

Apple's delay 'the right move'

The tech giant had said in its initial announcement that the latest changes will roll out this year as part of updates to its operating software for iPhones Macs and Apple Watches.

Matthew Green a top cryptography researcher at Johns Hopkins University told AP in August that the system could be used to frame innocent people by sending them seemingly innocuous images designed to trigger matches for child pornography. That could fool Apple’s algorithm and alert law enforcement.

Not long after Green and privacy advocates sounded warnings a developer claimed to have found a way to reverse-engineer the matching tool which works by recognising the mathematical “fingerprints” that represent an image.

Green said on Friday that Apple’s delay was the right move and suggested that the company talk to technical and policy communities and the general public before making such a big change that threatens the privacy of everyone's photo library.

""You need to build support before you launch something like this"" he said.

""This was a big escalation from scanning almost nothing to scanning private files"".

Green said Apple might have been blindsided by the widespread pushback to a policy aimed at child safety because it was so secretive in developing the new technique treating it the way it launches a new consumer product.

Reddit begins to tackle COVID misinformation

Reddit has banned an anti-vaxx and anti-mask subreddit after over a hundred popular Reddit communities went dark in protest against the platform's inaction on COVID misinformation.

Reddit initially refused to ban the subreddits spreading misinformation. However it announced on Wednesday that it had removed r/NoNewNormal which had been identified by other users as being a mass purveyor of COVID misinformation.

The subreddit had 124000 subscribers and had taken part in brigading which is an activity where users are sent to rival discussion groups to flood the comments and harass them. It was this behaviour that led to the ban.

Reddit also said that it is quarantining 54 other COVID-19 denial subreddits. This means it has flagged the groups’ content as having the potential to be “highly offensive or upsetting” and prevents it from showing up on the normal homepage.

It also promised to “build a new reporting feature for moderators to allow them to better provide us signal when they see community interference”.

These changes came about after other subreddits went dark in protest. r/Futurology which has over 15 million members announced their decision to take part in the protest saying: ""Futurology has gone private to protest Reddit’s inaction on Covid-19 misinformation. Weaponised misinformation is a key problem shaping our future. Reddit won’t enforce their policies against misinformation brigading and spamming"".

Apple to roll out digital driver’s licence and State IDs

Eight states in the US will roll out a feature allowing users to add their driver’s licence and state IDs to Apple Wallet for iPhone and Apple Watch to use at security at participating airports Apple announced on Wednesday.

The plan was first unveiled in a presentation in June. But there are some privacy concerns about handing over smartphones to police or security officials.

Apple says that there won’t be a need to unlock the phones or hand them over when going through airport security.

""The addition of driver’s licences and state IDs to Apple Wallet is an important step in our vision of replacing the physical wallet with a secure and easy-to-use mobile wallet"" said Jennifer Bailey Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet.

""We are excited that the TSA and so many states are already on board to help bring this to life for travellers across the country using only their iPhone and Apple Watch and we are already in discussions with many more states as we’re working to offer this nationwide in the future"".

Arizona and Georgia are the first states to adopt the feature and Connecticut Iowa Kentucky Maryland Oklahoma and Utah will follow though the company did not specify a timeline.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vd2hhdC1kYXRhLWlvcy1zaGFyZS1hcHBsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Data Does iOS Share With Apple?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vd2hhdC1kYXRhLWlvcy1zaGFyZS1hcHBsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvd3RvZ2Vlay5jb20vNzI1ODQyL3doYXQtaXMtYXBwbGVzLWZpbmQtbXktbmV0d29yay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is Apple's Find My Network?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvd3RvZ2Vlay5jb20vNzI1ODQyL3doYXQtaXMtYXBwbGVzLWZpbmQtbXktbmV0d29yay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Yet they can be cracked if their encryption is predictable. Now researchers reporting in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces have printed complexly encoded data with normal ink and a carbon nanoparticle-based invisible ink requiring both UV light and a computer that has been taught the code to reveal the correct messages.

Even as electronic records advance paper is still a common way to preserve data. Invisible ink can hide classified economic commercial or military information from prying eyes but many popular inks contain toxic compounds or can be seen with predictable methods such as light heat or chemicals. Carbon nanoparticles which have low toxicity can be essentially invisible under ambient lighting but can create vibrant images when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light – a modern take on invisible ink.



In addition advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models — made by networks of processing algorithms that learn how to handle complex information — can ensure that messages are only decipherable on properly trained computers. So Weiwei Zhao Kang Li Jie Xu and colleagues wanted to train an AI model to identify and decrypt symbols printed in a fluorescent carbon nanoparticle ink revealing hidden messages when exposed to UV light. Their results published in the ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.

With regular ink a computer trained with the codebook decodes “STOP” (top); when a UV light is shown on the paper the invisible ink is exposed and the real message is revealed as “BEGIN” (bottom).



The researchers made carbon nanoparticles from citric acid and cysteine which they diluted with water to create an invisible ink that appeared blue when exposed to UV light. The team loaded the solution into an ink cartridge and printed a series of simple symbols onto paper with an inkjet printer. Then they taught an AI model composed of multiple algorithms to recognize symbols illuminated by UV light and decode them using a special codebook.



Finally they tested the AI model’s ability to decode messages printed using a combination of both regular red ink and the UV fluorescent ink. With 100% accuracy the AI model read the regular ink symbols as “STOP” but when a UV light was shown on the writing the invisible ink illustrated the desired message “BEGIN”. Because these algorithms can notice minute modifications in symbols this approach has the potential to encrypt messages securely using hundreds of different unpredictable symbols the researchers say.

(Singapour) Brochettes de poulet satay ou bœuf rendang en version végétarienne : un nouveau laboratoire high-tech à Singapour recrée sans viande des classiques de la cuisine asiatique pour assouvir l’appétit grandissant de la région pour l’alimentation durable.

Martin Abbugao Agence France-Presse

Des scientifiques et des professionnels de l’alimentation en blouse blanche testent différents extraits végétaux pour concocter ces mets d’Asie en imitant au plus près les saveurs traditionnelles.

Ce laboratoire a été créé par le géant américain de la transformation et du négoce de matières premières agricoles Archer Daniels Midland (ADM).

La demande pour l’alimentation durable en Asie est encore émergente mais elle progresse surtout dans les pays les plus développés comme Singapour à mesure que les consommateurs cherchent une alimentation plus équilibrée et un impact moindre sur l’environnement.

Des burgers ou croquettes végétaux sont déjà vendus dans la région mais la société américaine cherche à séduire les palais des clients asiatiques avec des plats locaux.

« Nous travaillons avec des cuisiniers et des clients locaux pour développer et adapter des saveurs qui sont recherchées ici en Asie » explique Dirk Oyen vice-président et directeur de l’alimentation humaine de la société pour l’Asie du Sud-Est.

« C’est vraiment la clé de créer une saveur locale ».

Le laboratoire a déjà conçu des versions aux légumes du satay (habituellement des brochettes de viande à la sauce aux cacahouètes) et du rendang (curry de bœuf cuit dans du lait de coco avec des épices).

Inquiétudes pour la planète

Mais son objectif est d’inventer des mélanges protéinés à base de soja et de pois avec une texture et une saveur similaires à la viande.

Ces produits imitent le bœuf le porc ou le poulet et peuvent être utilisés pour cuisiner des plats locaux traditionnellement à base de viande.

Les consommateurs asiatiques sont déjà habitués au tofu et tempé (spécialité indonésienne à base de soja fermenté) mais ADM espère élargir encore l’offre.

Il veut notamment proposer une solution à ceux qui aiment le goût de la viande mais s’inquiètent de l’impact de l’élevage intensif sur la planète.

L’élevage intensif pour la consommation de viande est une source de méthane gaz qui favorise l’effet de serre. Dans certains pays comme le Brésil ce secteur contribue à la destruction des forêts barrières naturelles au réchauffement climatique.

Les fabricants de nouvelles protéines à base de plantes font cependant face à de nombreux défis comme ceux de persuader les consommateurs de changer leurs habitudes ou d’affronter une concurrence qui s’intensifie.

Singapour abrite déjà plusieurs jeunes pousses dans le domaine de l’alimentation durable comme Karana qui fabrique des raviolis à base de fruits au lieu de porc ou Sophie’s BioNutrients qui expérimente les micro-algues en guise de substituts aux fruits de mer et à la viande.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Le procureur près du tribunal de Soubré Koné Alexandre a mis en garde les auteurs de la traite et de l'exploitation des enfants dans la cacaoculture assurant que la phase de répression contre les coupables de ce délits est ouverte dans sa localité.



Après la phase de sensibilisation le gouvernement a décidé de passer à un autre cap.



""Il s'agit aujourd'hui de la phase 2 ou phase de la répression avec une tolérance zéro. Au cours cette opération de 48 heures des procédures seront ouvertes pour tous les auteurs pris et en cas d'infraction ils seront jugés avec des décisions rendues"" a-t-il expliqué.



Des mesures rigoureuses notamment des poursuites judiciaires et des sanctions seront appliquées contre tous les auteurs de ces infractions conformément à la loi a ajouté le magistrat.



Le procureur Koné Alexandre a fait cette déclaration lors d'une rencontre avec la presse en marge de la vaste opération lancée dans la localité par le Comité de lutte contre la traite l'exploitation et les pires formes de travail des enfants vendredi 07 mai 2021 au tribunal de Soubré.



Selon M. Koné Alexandre face à un phénomène ayant fortement terni l'image de la Côte d'Ivoire à l'international l'Etat ivoirien a pris des dispositions afin de protéger l'intégrité physique et moral des enfants pour les aider à grandir dans un environnement sain.



""La place des enfants se trouve à l'école et non dans une plantation. Et tous les efforts doivent être déployés pour gagner ce pari"" a indiqué le procureur de Soubré exhortant les uns et les autres particulièrement ceux qui s'adonnent à ses pratiques à faire en sorte d'assainir l'environnement des enfants. ""Il faut donc mettre fin à l'exploitation des enfants"" a-t-il conseillé.

Smith is disappointed with Patrick Beverley for his behavior toward a fan and a producer following the Bucks' loss. (2:30)

INDIANAPOLIS -- Indianapolis police announced Wednesday they've opened an investigation into an ""NBA player and citizen"" altercation that happened at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on the night Milwaukee Bucks guard Patrick Beverley threw a ball at a fan in the final minutes of a season-ending loss to the Indiana Pacers.

Police said in a news release the case has been forwarded to detectives ""who are currently investigating this situation and take all accusations seriously.""

Detectives will present the case to the Marion County Prosecutor's Office at the conclusion of the investigation the release stated.

Cameras showed Beverley sitting on the bench and tossing a ball into the stands hitting a fan in the head with about 2½ minutes left in Thursday's contest. After a different fan threw the ball back to Beverley who was holding his arm out for it the Bucks guard fired it back at that spectator.

Beverley spoke about his behavior on an episode of ""The Pat Bev Podcast"" that was released Wednesday. He said he was called a word that he'd never been called before but added that his own actions were ""still inexcusable.""

""I will be better"" he said. ""I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said that should have never happened. Simple as that.""

Beverley added the atmosphere in Indianapolis ""was great"" aside from ""a handful of fans"" who crossed a line. The Pacers beat the Bucks 120-98 eliminating Milwaukee in six games in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.

""I will be better. I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said that should have never happened. Simple as that.""

""I ain't bringing a basketball on the bench no more"" Beverley said. ""That ... threw my whole vibe off.""

After the game Beverley wouldn't allow ESPN journalist Malinda Adams to ask him a question in a group interview in the locker room. He said it was because she didn't subscribe to his podcast. Beverley told her to get her microphone out of his face then eventually asked her to leave the interview circle.

On his podcast Wednesday Beverley said he had asked that of reporters who interviewed him ever since he launched his podcast. Beverley said he told Adams that ""it was never my intent to disrespect you.""

A day after the loss Bucks coach Doc Rivers said Beverley's behavior was ""not the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way.""

""We're better than that"" Rivers said. ""Pat feels awful about that. He also understands emotionally -- this is an emotional game and things happen -- unfortunately you're judged immediately and he let the emotions get the better of him.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOC91cy9iZXJuYXJkLXBvbGl0ZS1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtcGFzdG9yLWNvdXNpbi9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFPaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNS8wOC91cy9iZXJuYXJkLXBvbGl0ZS1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtcGFzdG9yLWNvdXNpbg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The man who allegedly tried shooting a pastor in the face at church is now charged with homicide in his cousin’s death,"CNN —

Hours before Bernard Polite allegedly tried to kill a Pennsylvania pastor in front of his congregation Sunday the suspect shot and killed his cousin at their home police said.

Polite 26 is now charged with criminal homicide in the death of Derek Polite 56 and is awaiting arraignment. Even though the two were cousins the suspect often referred to Derek Polite as his “uncle” Allegheny County Police Superintendent Christopher Kearns said.

Bernard Polite Allegheny County Jail

The motive for the killing in North Braddock remains unclear Kearns said.

“There’s no indication there was any kind of disturbance in the residence. We saw no evidence that there was any type of altercation” he said. “It appears the victim was shot as he was walking up the steps from the first floor to the second.”

Ballistics testing revealed the gun used to kill Derek Polite was the same gun recovered Sunday at nearby Jesus’ Dwelling Place Church where Bernard Polite allegedly pointed a gun at Pastor Glenn Germany’s face and pulled the trigger police said.

But the bullet got stuck in the gun’s chamber and a church deacon managed to tackle the gunman before he could fire another shot.

The pastor told CNN he was shocked by how narrowly he missed getting shot in the head since the same gun proved to be deadly earlier in the day.

“The gun worked in the incident (involving) shooting his cousin to death” Germany said.

“When he came down to the church it was the same gun. And he pulled that (trigger)” the pastor said. “I thank God that the gun jammed. The police officer showed us because he took the (bullet) out of the chamber. It was stuck in the chamber. You can see the dents in the bullet where it was stuck.”

After the church deacon disarmed the gunman Germany held the suspect to the ground and told him he forgave him before police arrived and arrested him early Sunday afternoon.

Bernard Polite faces charges of attempted criminal homicide aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person in connection with the church incident court records show.

After learning about the church incident Sunday concerned relatives went to the cousins’ home to check on Derek Polite “and discovered him deceased inside” Allegheny County police said.

The police chief said a combination of ballistics evidence and witness statements helped link suspect Bernard Polite to both crime scenes.

“One witness for him (was) on the porch of the residence just before 10 a.m.” Kearns said. “We had another witness who heard what they believed to be a gunshot around 10 a.m.”

Bernard Polite remains in custody at the Allegheny County Jail. It was not immediately clear if he had an attorney. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for next Monday.

It was a frenzied moment of both nostalgia and hope that the past and present will collide to bring more triumphs with Pope as the coach at his alma mater.

On the one hand Pope has yet to win an NCAA Tournament game across nine total seasons as a coach at Utah Valley and BYU. Though his career 187-108 record is solid his resume pales in comparison to national-title winners such as Billy Donovan Dan Hurley and Scott Drew who were each connected to the UK opening at some level.

But on the other hand Pope knows firsthand what it takes to reach the pinnacle of college basketball while wearing a Wildcats uniform. Kentucky went 62-7 during Pope's two seasons under Rick Pitino earned a pair of No. 1 seeds in the NCAA Tournament and won the trophy that Pope toted on his way off the bus.

Pope averaged 7.6 points 5.2 rebounds and 1.2 blocks in 20.3 minutes per game for the 1995-96 title team earning him a spot in the lore of a proud program.

""Guys it is the greatest honor that I will ever have in my professional...career to be able to come back here and do this with you"" Pope said. ""The difference between Kentucky and every other program in the country is that this is not my team. It is not even our team. It is our team.""

Time will tell whether the passionate reunion between Kentucky and Pope yields the results UK fans are hoping for. They don't have to look far for an example of how a joyous reunion can go wrong. Kenny Payne won a national championship as a player at Louisville in 1986 but flopped as a coach posting a 12-52 mark in two seasons from 2022-24.

Recent history shows that coaches returning to the schools where they once played produce a mixture of results ranging from horrendous to triumphant. Here's the ranking of big hits big misses and a look at some of those who fell somewhere in between.

The coaches ranked are either active now or were hired by their former school within the past 15 years.

Big hits

1. Matt Painter Purdue (2005-present)

Painter spent one season as a college head coach at Southern Illinois before returning to Purdue to be the Boilermakers head coach in waiting in 2004. After one season working under Gene Keady his former coach Painter took over the head job. Now 19 years in his stardom has never been higher. The Boilermakers are coming off consecutive outright Big Ten titles and just reached the Final Four for the first time since 1980.

2. Fred Hoiberg Iowa State (2010-15)

With no collegiate coaching experience Hoiberg took over at Iowa State just a few years after retiring as a player. He produced stunning results for a program that had posted four straight losing records before his arrival. After going 16-16 in Year 1 Hoiberg took ISU to four straight NCAA Tournaments before he was hired as head coach of the Chicago Bulls.

3. Hubert Davis North Carolina (2021-present)

Davis is doing a nice job through three seasons as he navigates the unenviable task of replacing Roy Williams. He started by leading the Tar Heels to the Final Four in 2021-22. Although the 2022-23 season was a big flop UNC rebounded by winning the ACC regular season title and reaching the Sweet 16 as a No. 1 seed in 2023-24. Next year's squad is shaping up quite nicely as UNC stands at No. 3 in Gary Parrish's Top 25 And 1.

4. Jamie Dixon TCU (2016-present)

TCU had been to just two NCAA Tournaments since expansion in 1985 before Dixon took over in 2017. The former Horned Frogs guard has guided his alma mater to four appearances in the Big Dance and six 20-win seasons in eight years. TCU was a Big 12 punching bag before Dixon's arrival. Now it has made three consecutive NCAA Tournaments for the first time in program history.

5. Jon Scheyer Duke (2022-present)

Elevated to replace Mike Krzyzewski at just 34 Scheyer has kept the Duke standard high in his first two years by winning the ACC Tournament in his first season and reaching the Elite Eight in his second. Scheyer has another big challenge ahead as he builds his 2024-25 roster around No. 1 ranked freshman Cooper Flagg. His legacy is mostly undetermined at this point but he's been good so far.

Big misses

Kenny Payne failed to find the success success at Louisville that he had as a player. USATSI

1. Kenny Payne Louisville (2022-24)



After years as an assistant at Oregon Kentucky and with the New York Knicks Payne landed the head coaching job at his alma mater in 2022. His tenure an unmitigated disaster. The Cardinals lost an exhibition game to Division II Lenoir-Rhyne before Payne's tenure officially began and things never improved. He was fired after going 12-52 in two seasons.

2. Kim Anderson Missouri (2014-17)

Unlike many of the other busts Anderson actually entered with significant experience running a college program. His Central Missouri team won the 2014 Division II national title and that achievement catapulted Anderson to the top seat at Mizzou. But the Tigers never won more than 10 games in his three seasons and Anderson's tenure concluded with an 8-46 mark in SEC play.

3. Eddie Jordan Rutgers (2013-16)

Jordan starred for Rutgers' 1976 Final Four team and enjoyed a fruitful NBA playing and coaching career. But he couldn't replicate that success at Rutgers. Faced with the difficult task of navigating the Scarlet Knights from the Big East to the Big Ten Jordan posted a 7-25 (1-17 Big Ten) mark in his third and final season.

4. Patrick Ewing Georgetown (2017-23)

Ewing's tenure began in somewhat respectable fashion as the Hoyas finished 19-14 (9-9 Big East) with an NIT appearance in his second season. Then in Year 4 he led the Hoyas on a stunning Big East Tournament title run that resulted in a surprise NCAA Tournament appearance. But the bottom fell out during his last two seasons as Georgetown went 13-50 overall and 2-37 in the Big East which led to a change following the 2022-23 season.

A three-time Big East Player of the Year during his time in college Mullin landed the St. John's job in 2015 and steadily improved culminating with an appearance in the 2019 NCAA Tournament. But on the whole it was a struggle. The Red Storm never posted a winning record in Big East play during Mullin's four seasons as he finished just 20-52 in conference games.

Mixed bag

These prominent coaches who were hired by the schools where they played are a mixed bag of success and frustration.

Mike Woodson Indiana (2021-present)

Neither of Woodson's two most-recent predecessors at Indiana did anything worth mentioning in their first three seasons and by the time Archie Miller was fired in 2021 it had been five years since the Hoosiers reached the NCAA Tournament. Woodson came in and immediately got IU to consecutive NCAA Tournaments. Though IU regressed to 19-14 and missed the Big Dance in 2024 Woodson has a strong class of transfers entering. This one could still go either way.

Juwan Howard Michigan (2019-24)

Howard took Michigan to an Elite Eight as a No. 1 seed in his second season and led the Wolverines back to the Sweet 16 the following season. It ended in flames following an 8-24 season and plenty of drama. But his five-year roller-coaster of a tenure featured some highs that should be acknowledged.

Penny Hardaway Memphis (2018-present)

Memphis has won 20+ games in all six seasons of Hardaway's tenure which is impressive for someone who entered the job with no coaching experience beyond the high school level. But the Tigers have yet to reach the second weekend of the NCAA Tournament. Given the big game Hardaway talked early in his tenure the lack of postseason pop is disappointing.

Shaheen Holloway Seton Hall (2022-present)

Holloway just led Seton Hall to a 25-win season and NIT title after the Pirates were left on the wrong side of the NCAA Tournament bubble with a 13-7 Big East record. Normally that type of season would be a harbinger of big things to come. But the portal hit Seton Hall with force leaving Holloway on uneven footing entering Year 3 on the job.

The Therapists Quit.,"In spring 2023 members of the American Friends Service Committee a prominent Philadelphia-based social justice organization published a letter renouncing one of their own. It alleged that Raquel Saraswati its chief equity and inclusion officer who for years had claimed to be a person of Arab South Asian and Latino descent was in fact a white woman.

Saraswati who had often spoken publicly about LGBTQ+ rights BIPOC empowerment and Islamophobia denied the allegations. Nonetheless she resigned from the organization in February as well-regarded local news outlets picked up the story. In February 2023 The Intercept quoted Saraswati’s mother saying that her daughter who legally changed her last name from Seidel years ago was “as white as the driven snow.”

Some activists compared Saraswati to Rachel Dolezal the disgraced former president of the Spokane NAACP chapter who was born to white parents but claimed she was Black.

Saraswati found a place to land after her disgrace: Full Spectrum Therapy an LGBTQ+ psychotherapy clinic in Portland that focuses on serving low-income trans and nonbinary clients. She handles equity and human resources for the clinic.

The refuge was short-lived. Soon after her hiring therapists at Full Spectrum found out who she was and raised objections to her hiring in a Sept. 22 email to the clinic’s founder. But Saraswati stayed employed. (By all accounts Saraswati works remotely from Philadelphia.)

By the beginning of 2024 more than half of the therapists at Full Spectrum had left because of Saraswati’s hiring.

Full Spectrum is one of a handful of clinics in the city that specializes in counseling for trans and nonbinary clients—a type of care that’s in increasingly high demand. In fact the absence of culturally specific and gender-identity-specific therapy is so pronounced that the Oregon Legislature recently directed $80 million to building up culturally responsive behavioral health providers—$235000 of it to Full Spectrum.

The exodus from Full Spectrum widened the desert of clinics that work specifically with trans and nonbinary clients.

“There are such limited resources for trans and nonbinary clients who can’t do private pay. That’s what makes this extra painful and heartbreaking for us” says Kaspar Woods one of the clinicians who left Full Spectrum in the fall. “It’s heartbreaking to have to bring this level of conflict to a trans person.”

Full Spectrum CEO Sam Skye says that “calling Raquel a danger to clients and staff echoes the anti-Muslim bigotry rampant today. It is very disappointing that any former staff would perpetuate these prejudices.”

Saraswati echoed that in a statement.

“The tropes of a ‘sneaky conniving manipulative woman’ and ‘untrustworthy lying infiltrating Muslim’ are deeply harmful discriminatory and hateful’” Saraswati said adding that she won’t resign. “If anything this has opened the door for me to experience further harassment and harm.”

Skye opened a small therapy practice in Portland in 2017. His aim: to serve a population that’s increasingly seeking therapy but has few places to turn.

More than 90% of Full Spectrum’s clients are on Medicaid. That means the practice serves a population that’s doubly marginalized both for their gender identity and because they’re low-income. Over the past few years Skye expanded the clinic to include more than 20 licensed and pre-licensed therapists.

Skye had joined a slice of the therapy market that the Oregon Legislature was trying to build up. Since May 2022 the Oregon Health Authority has provided $350000 in grants to Full Spectrum two-thirds of which came from a state program aimed at recruiting and retaining behavioral health providers that serve underrepresented communities.

On Sept. 8 the clinic’s clinical director announced the hiring of a woman named Raquel as the Director of People and Culture. The email did not include Raquel’s last name nor any information about her work experience. That woman was Saraswati.

In a Sept. 18 staff meeting Saraswati introduced herself. Former clinicians WW spoke to said she made vague reference to a smear campaign she’d endured earlier that year.

That rang a bell for one of the clinicians who found Saraswati’s backstory in news clips. That clinician told others what they’d found and word seemed to have circled back to Skye. On Sept. 20 Skye sent the staff a 1200-word telling of Saraswati’s story in which Skye painted Saraswati as a victim.

“Raquel shared a laundry list of conspiracy claims she’s suffered from being accused of having two husbands to wearing a prosthetic nose to being a double agent for a foreign government” Skye wrote. “She described the events that transpired at her former workplace and the ongoing harassment death threats and targeting by groups motivated by their racist Islamophobic misogynistic and homophobic aims.”

Skye called Saraswati a woman of color in his email and said Saraswati’s story was a “tale of leadership identity and overcoming adversity.”

Two days later a handful of clinicians sent an anonymous letter to Skye demanding that he fire Saraswati immediately.

“The staff of Full Spectrum Therapy assert that [Raquel’s] presence at FST presents a clear and immediate threat to the wellbeing of our clients our staff and the Portland community” they wrote on Sept. 22. “FST staff demand immediate removal of [Raquel] from all responsibilities at FST. …Staff is united in our demands and prepared to stop work to protect ourselves and our clients from further harm.”

Clinicians exchanged worries about Saraswati’s hiring in a September email chain.

One wrote of their concerns “So even while I can critique and question the social construction of race in America I am also aware that we need strong opposition to the Rachel Dolezal’s of the world from appropriating the language of gender dysphoria to justify their behavior.”

Later that day Skye scheduled a Monday Zoom meeting with clinicians about Saraswati. He instructed clinicians not to record the meeting for “legal” reasons.

Skye opened the meeting with a long statement his voice sounding tired and quivery. He called the anonymous email sent by staff the “antithesis of collective liberation” and said that “veiled threats are not acceptable here.”

One at a time staff asked Skye questions about Saraswati’s hiring process. He explained he’d hired Saraswati as a contractor in February and then hired her full-time that fall. He’d met Saraswati because she was a friend of the then-chief operating officer at Full Spectrum Trystan Reese. There was no job posting and no other candidates were considered Skye said.

“When you have a candidate whose resume is ideal and is also a diverse candidate” Skye said “there’s no reason to bring white candidates into the picture.”

To Eli Cuda a former clinician who left in November it felt like Skye had been hiding Saraswati. “It felt like we were unwilling participants in this secret” Cuda says.

By mid-December at least 10 clinicians had left the practice because of Saraswati’s hiring and Skye’s refusal to fire her. All were trans or nonbinary and several were people of color.

Quinn Rivenburgh a licensed therapist who worked at Full Spectrum from 2021 to November 2023 and supervised 12 of the clinic’s pre-licensed clinicians says Skye instructed them during the height of the Saraswati backlash to “defend the interests of the company.”

“That was a huge red flag for me” Rivenburgh recalls “due to the potential to compromise my ethics and responsibilities as a clinical supervisor.”

Rivenburgh was laid off in November after many of their direct reports quit. Some of the clinicians who departed started private practices. Others joined existing clinics. All tell WW they felt Saraswati’s hiring at Full Spectrum had the potential to hurt their vulnerable clients.

Skye called the therapists’ letter “a demonstration of discriminatory harassment containing falsehoods lies libelous statements regarding fraud and theft and malicious distortions of the truth” and added that staff turnover is typical while a business is shifting.

Saraswati says she takes her job seriously. “Under no circumstances have I ever compromised confidentiality or put any colleague at risk” Saraswati said. “This is a problem some have created in order to force an outcome.”

The current staffing level at Full Spectrum is unclear.

Some clinicians say they felt like they abandoned their clients some of whom were estranged from their families and had formed a deep connection with their therapist.

“The secure attachment that’s formed between a therapist and a client is incredibly healing” Cuda says. “When it’s disrupted it’s really disruptive to the client.”"

Foundations of NLP Explained — Bleu Score and WER Metrics

A Gentle Guide to two essential metrics (Bleu Score and Word Error Rate) for NLP models in Plain English Ketan Doshi · Follow Published in Towards Data Science · 10 min read · May 9 2021 -- 7 Listen Share

Most NLP applications such as machine translation chatbots text summarization and language models generate some text as their output. In addition applications like image captioning or automatic speech recognition (ie. Speech-to-Text) output text even though they may not be considered pure NLP applications.

How good is the predicted output?

The common problem when training these applications is how do we decide how ‘good’ that output is?

With applications like say image classification the predicted class can be compared unambiguously with the target class to decide whether the output is correct or not. However the problem is much trickier with applications where the output is a sentence.

In such a case we don’t always have one universally correct answer — we could have many correct answers. When translating a sentence for instance two different people may come up with two slightly different answers both of which are completely correct.

eg. “The ball is blue” and “The ball has a blue color”.

The problem is even harder with applications like image captioning or text summarization where the range of acceptable answers is even larger.

The same image can have many valid captions (Image by Author)

In order to evaluate the performance of our model we need a quantitative metric to measure the quality of its predictions.

In this article I will cover two major NLP metrics which you are likely to use fairly frequently with your NLP models.

Also if you are interested in NLP I have a few articles that explore other fascinating topics in this space.

Automatic Speech Recognition (Speech-to-Text algorithm and architecture using CTC Loss and Decoding for aligning sequences.) Beam Search (how Beam Search enhances predictions in NLP models)

NLP Metric

Over the years a number of different NLP metrics have been developed to tackle this problem. One of the most popular is called the Bleu Score.

It is far from perfect and it has many drawbacks. But it is simple to compute and understand and has several compelling benefits. Even though it has many alternatives it continues to be one of the most frequently used metrics.

It is based on the idea that the closer the predicted sentence is to the human-generated target sentence the better it is.

Bleu Scores are between 0 and 1. A score of 0.6 or 0.7 is considered the best you can achieve. Even two humans would likely come up with different sentence variants for a problem and would rarely achieve a perfect match. For this reason a score closer to 1 is unrealistic in practice and should raise a flag that your model is overfitting.

Before we get into how Bleu Score is calculated let’s understand two concepts first viz. N-grams and Precision.

N-gram

An ‘n-gram’ is actually a widely used concept from regular text processing and is not specific to NLP or Bleu Score. It is just a fancy way of describing “a set of ’n’ consecutive words in a sentence”.

For instance in the sentence “The ball is blue” we could have n-grams such as:

1-gram (unigram): “The” “ball” “is” “blue”

2-gram (bigram): “The ball” “ball is” “is blue”

3-gram (trigram): “The ball is” “ball is blue”

4-gram: “The ball is blue”

Note that the words in an n-gram are taken in order so “blue is The ball” is not a valid 4-gram.

Precision

This metric measures the number of words in the Predicted Sentence that also occur in the Target Sentence.

Let’s say that we have:

Target Sentence : He eats an apple

: He eats an apple Predicted Sentence: He ate an apple

We would normally compute the Precision using the formula:

Precision = Number of correct predicted words / Number of total predicted words

Precision = 3 / 4

But using Precision like this is not good enough. There are two cases that we still need to handle.

Repetition

The first issue is that this formula allows us to cheat. We could predict a sentence:

Target Sentence : He eats an apple

: He eats an apple Predicted Sentence: He He He

and get a perfect Precision = 3 / 3 = 1

Multiple Target Sentences

Secondly as we’ve already discussed there are many correct ways to express the same sentence. In many NLP models we might be given multiple acceptable target sentences that capture these different variations.

We account for these two scenarios using a modified Precision formula which we’ll call “Clipped Precision”.

Clipped Precision

Let’s go through an example to understand how it works.

Let’s say that we have the following sentences:

Target Sentence 1 : He eats a sweet apple

: He eats a sweet apple Target Sentence 2 : He is eating a tasty apple

: He is eating a tasty apple Predicted Sentence: He He He eats tasty fruit

We now do two things differently:

We compare each word from the predicted sentence with all of the target sentences. If the word matches any target sentence it is considered to be correct.

We limit the count for each correct word to the maximum number of times that that word occurs in the Target Sentence. This helps to avoid the Repetition problem. This will become clearer below.

Clipped Precision (Image by Author)

For instance the word “He” occurs only once in each Target Sentence. Therefore even though “He” occurs thrice in the Predicted Sentence we ‘clip’ the count to one as that is the maximum count in any Target Sentence.

Clipped Precision = Clipped number of correct predicted words / Number of total predicted words

Clipped Precision = 3 / 6

NB: For the rest of this article we will just use “Precision” to mean “Clipped Precision”.

We are now ready to go ahead and calculate the Bleu Score.

How is Bleu Score calculated?

Let’s say we have an NLP model that produces a predicted sentence as below. For simplicity we will take just one Target Sentence but as in the example above the procedure for multiple Target Sentences is very similar.

Target Sentence : The guard arrived late because it was raining

: The guard arrived late because it was raining Predicted Sentence: The guard arrived late because of the rain

The first step is to compute Precision scores for 1-grams through 4-grams.

Precision 1-gram

We use the Clipped Precision method that we just discussed.

Precision 1-gram = Number of correct predicted 1-grams / Number of total predicted 1-grams

Precision(Image by Author)

So Precision 1-gram (p₁) = 5 / 8

Precision 2-gram

Precision 2-gram = Number of correct predicted 2-grams / Number of total predicted 2-grams

Let’s look at all the 2-grams in our predicted sentence:

Precision 2-gram (Image by Author)

So Precision 2-gram (p₂) = 4 / 7

Precision 3-gram

Similarly Precision 3-gram (p₃) = 3 / 6

Precision 3-gram (Image by Author)

Precision 4-gram

And Precision 4-gram (p₄) = 2 / 5

Precision 4-gram(Image by Author)

Geometric Average Precision Scores

Next we combine these Precision Scores using the formula below. This can be computed for different values of N and using different weight values. Typically we use N = 4 and uniform weights wₙ = N / 4

Precision Scores (Image by Author)

Brevity Penalty

The third step is to compute a ‘Brevity Penalty’.

If you notice how Precision is calculated we could have output a predicted sentence consisting of a single word like “The’ or “late”. For this the 1-gram Precision would have been 1/1 = 1 indicating a perfect score. This is obviously misleading because it encourages the model to output fewer words and get a high score.

To offset this the Brevity Penalty penalizes sentences that are too short.

Brevity Penalty(Image by Author)

c is predicted length = number of words in the predicted sentence and

r is target length = number of words in the target sentence

This ensures that the Brevity Penalty cannot be larger than 1 even if the predicted sentence is much longer than the target. And if you predict very few words this value will be small.

In this example c = 8 and r = 8 which means Brevity Penalty = 1

Bleu Score

Finally to calculate the Bleu Score we multiply the Brevity Penalty with the Geometric Average of the Precision Scores.

Bleu Score (Image by Author)

Bleu Score can be computed for different values of N. Typically we use N = 4.

BLEU-1 uses the unigram Precision score

BLEU-2 uses the geometric average of unigram and bigram precision

BLEU-3 uses the geometric average of unigram bigram and trigram precision

and so on.

If you look at different resources on the Internet you might also encounter a slightly different way to write the Bleu Score formula which is mathematically equivalent.

Implementing Bleu Score in Python

In practice you will rarely have to implement the Bleu Score algorithm on your own. The nltk library which is a very useful library for NLP functionality provides an implementation of Bleu Score.

Now that we know how Bleu Score works there are a few more points that we should note.

Bleu Score is computed on a corpus not individual sentences

Although we used examples of matching single sentences Bleu Score is calculated by considering the text of the entire predicted corpus as a whole.

Therefore you cannot compute Bleu Score separately on each sentence in the corpus and then average those scores in some way.

Strengths of Bleu Score

The reason that Bleu Score is so popular is that it has several strengths:

It is quick to calculate and easy to understand.

It corresponds with the way a human would evaluate the same text.

Importantly it is language-independent making it straightforward to apply to your NLP models.

It can be used when you have more than one ground truth sentence.

It is used very widely which makes it easier to compare your results with other work.

Weaknesses of Bleu Score

In spite of its popularity Bleu Score has been criticized for its weaknesses:

It does not consider the meaning of words. It is perfectly acceptable to a human to use a different word with the same meaning eg. Use “watchman” instead of “guard”. But Bleu Score considers that an incorrect word.

It looks only for exact word matches. Sometimes a variant of the same word can be used eg. “rain” and “raining” but Bleu Score counts that as an error.

It ignores the importance of words. With Bleu Score an incorrect word like “to” or “an” that is less relevant to the sentence is penalized just as heavily as a word that contributes significantly to the meaning of the sentence.

It does not consider the order of words eg. The sentence “The guard arrived late because of the rain” and “The rain arrived late because of the guard” would get the same (unigram) Bleu Score even though the latter is quite different.

Speech-to-Text applications use Word Error Rate not Bleu Score

Although Automatic Speech Recognition models also output text the target sentence is unambiguous and usually not subject to interpretation. In this case Bleu Score is not the ideal metric.

The metric that is typically used for these applications is Word Error Rate (WER) or its sibling Character Error Rate (CER). It compares the predicted output and the target transcript word by word (or character by character) to figure out the number of differences between them.

A difference could be a word that is present in the transcript but missing from the prediction (counted as a Deletion) a word that is not in the transcript but has been added into the prediction (an Insertion) or a word that is altered between the prediction and the transcript (a Substitution).

Count the Insertions Deletions and Substitutions between the Transcript and the Prediction (Image by Author)

The metric formula is fairly straightforward. It is the percent of differences relative to the total number of words.

Word Error Rate computation (Image by Author)

The WER calculation is based on the Levenstein distance which measures the differences between two words.

Although WER is the most widely used metric for Speech Recognition it has some drawbacks:

It does not distinguish between words that are important to the meaning of the sentence and those that are not as relevant.

When comparing words it does not consider whether two words are different in just a single character or are completely different.

Conclusion

Hopefully this gives you an understanding of two of NLP’s most important metrics along with its pros and cons.

MEMPHIS Tenn. — It's the home of the blues the birthplace of rock and roll and a hotspot for world-famous food.

It's no wonder the Memphis hotel market is booming.

Nicholas Janysek the director of sales marketing and events at the Hyatt Centric on Beale Street said the comeback is being fueled by tourists and locals alike who have spent the better part of last year dealing with the global pandemic.

""We see it in the occupancy and numbers obviously pre-Covid"" Janysek said. ""We took a little bit of a stumble over the past year but we’re seeing it come back.""

In the just Downtown area more than 400 hotel rooms have been added since January 2020.

Some of Memphis' other new hotels include the Canopy by Hilton across the street from AutoZone Park and the Memphian Hotel in Overton Square. These iconic locations draw in investors who see potential with hotels just steps away.

It's not all leisure travel and activity that's picking up at these hotels. Economist Dr. John Gnuschke said companies are planning trips to different cities again.

""We’re seeing more and more interest in revitalizing the economy"" Gnuschke said. ""With that is going to come meetings and conferences and celebrations.""

It opens with an unnerving sequence that culminates in a close-up of a human eye. The eye belongs to Anthony as he turns the camera on himself to reveal the optic nerve which subtitles inform us connects the eye to the brain yet itself carries no visual information. Or per the film: “At the exact point where the world meets the seeing of the world we’re blind.” This declaration coupled with the hallucinatory shots of Anthony’s eye are startling in their directness and intimacy. In a matter of seconds Anthony establishes his governing intentions namely to indict illusions of objectivism associated with sight including his own as the maker of this film.

The blind spots—the elisions and distortions that come with framing recording or merely seeing—that particularly obsess Anthony concern those in the realm of surveillance technology. All Light Everywhere follows several strands that are united by two themes: the encroachment of surveillance hardware and software into everyday life and the fact that such developments are as riven with racist classist biases as any other element of society. Two of the strands tackle the rise of body cameras in law enforcement from complementing angles from the point of view of the Arizona-based company Axon Enterprise which manufactures the Taser and has a near monopoly on body camera technology and from that of Baltimore police officers taking a training seminar on how to use the cameras in the field. In each strand chilling dystopian euphemisms are used (such as “non-lethal weapons”) to justify a new form of justice-as-commodity. Certain scenes particularly with Axon exec Steve Tuttle pridefully sometimes oxymoronically promoting various cameras and weapons suggest that the brutal corporate satire of Paul Verhoeven’s RoboCop is close to reaching actual fruition.

An irony becomes evident early on in All Light Everywhere as the surveillance technology that’s being developed for law enforcement suggests a form of capitalism as ass-covering. The ghosts of so many young black people killed by police haunt this film—Freddie Gray is explicitly mentioned at one point—and the cameras appear to be less an aid for helping citizens than a new form of manipulatable alibi for cops. The cameras are worn on officers’ chests and as Anthony vividly demonstrates utilize a wide-angle lens that distorts its field of vision making human movement appear sharper and more aggressive than it may be in reality. This footage is then uploaded into a software program that’s guarded by intellectual property laws and therefore subject to little government scrutiny. This footage can also allow the officers to refresh their memories or by implication reframe a story.

Anthony is aware that the money being pumped into these innovations could be spent to improve the communities being policed which is to say that these surveillance devices epitomize yet again the ongoing debate regarding the respective roles of social service and law enforcement in America. Social service is advocated wrenchingly by Baltimore citizens in the film’s third strand in which Ross McNutt the founder of Persistent Surveillance Systems attempts to sell the notion of allowing his drone hardware to fly over the city rendering a Google Earth-style recording of neighborhoods from a God’s-eye view.

Astonishingly McNutt’s recording was taking place without even the mayor’s permission and was eventually shuttered and he now finds himself going to community meetings to sell his covert project. The citizens at the meetings are almost entirely black and many of them wonder why the surveillance is occurring primarily in low-income neighborhoods of color. McNutt who’s white doesn’t have an answer for that though Anthony doesn’t score easy points on a man who’s allowing his tech obsessions to override common concerns. In fact Anthony also films citizens who support the technology and he also shows himself filming the meetings—rhyming his invasion of privacy with McNutt’s.

As fascinating as these various strands are in their own right All Light Everywhere is cumulatively extraordinary for its open-mindedness and sense of poetry. This isn’t a film with a reductive political ax to grind. Anthony is justifiably skeptical of our surveillance culture yet he also sees the wonder of it and empathizes with people on all places on the social ladder and on all sides of various volatile subjects. Particularly notable is the carefulness with which he films the (also mostly black) police in the training seminar capturing their curiosity and trepidation in a matter of seconds refusing to shirk away from their humanity.

Filming the police Anthony reveals how these cameras can disserve them as well as everyone else turning them in the public eye into a kind of militarized machine. This association is deepened by the history Anthony offers of the developments of cameras and of cinema which have always been linked to weaponry as early cameras were shaped like guns (hence the photographic term “shot”) and recording and magnifying technology was quickly utilized to refine military warfare. Not even these montages are routine as they’re inflamed with Anthony’s obsessiveness—his determination to divine the corruptibility of sight and the essential link between violence and surveillance as mutual actions of war—for dominion. (There’s even a short tutorial on eugenics the deeply racist pseudo-science that’s connected here devastatingly to the broadly black features of a law enforcement practice dummy.)

Filmmaking especially of the nonfiction variety is itself a form of surveillance and it can be utilized as an instrument of both expression and investigation—two modes that Anthony blends here with seeming effortlessness. There’s especially a sense of awe in the fourth nearly abstract strand which is composed primarily of close-ups of people’s faces as their responses to various media stimuli is measured with headgear. These faces accompanied by Dan Deacon’s poignant rapturous trance-out of a score appear to be in a meditative bliss suggesting that technology is at its base a drug—a notion that Steven Spielberg mined in his similarly themed and similarly visionary Minority Report.

All Light Everywhere captures many paradoxes and biases of sight and photography from the hellish to the transcendent even deconstructing itself along the way to reveal its own omissions and selective emphases. Besides Anthony’s consistent presence in the film in which he’s shown manipulating performances shots and editing rhythms subtitled information and a ruminative resonantly robotic narration by Keaver Brenai suggest alternate haunting almost ephemeral points of view as if the film is at war with itself as an embodiment of all its critiques. All Light Everywhere is head-spinning serving as proof in the tradition of Frederick Wiseman and Robert Greene’s cinema that political works can also be beautiful.

While we expected an official announcement shortly after that didn’t happen. Now the device has been officially listed on ZTE’s global website along with some key specs.

The listing reveals the ZTE Blade A51 has a 6.52-inch full view HD+ display with a waterdrop notch. ZTE has adopted what it calls a diamond geometric division design for the back of the phone and also given it a textured finish for a comfortable feeling and better grip. The phone is available in Steel Blue and Pearl Gray.

The back of the phone is home to two rear cameras – a 16MP sensor and a depth lens. Both sensors and an LED flash are housed in the same housing. There is a fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone and you also get face recognition.

The listing does not say the chipset powering the phone neither does it state the RAM storage capacity and front-facing camera specification. However it is revealed that the phone has a 4000mAh battery capacity which is different from the 3200mAh capacity the FCC listing.

We don’t know when the Blade A51 will be available for purchase which countries will get it and how much it will cost but we hope more details will be revealed soon.

These standards cover a range of issues from emissions to corporate governance.

“We’re very aware of the environment and the concerns that everyone has about how we treat the environment” said President and CEO Mike John adding that it’s critical to the company and the dry natural gas industry to step up and be measured and accountable for what they produce and how they produce it. “We believe we’re part of the solution to cleaning up the air not part of the problem.”

Northeast is headquartered in Charleston with a Morgantown office. It has extensive operations in Monongalia County. Two of its Morgantown Industrial Park wells are Marcellus Shale Energy and Environmental Laboratory research projects conducted by the National Energy Technology Laboratory WVU and Ohio State University.

Responsible Energy Solutions will audit Northeast’s production pertaining to two separate certification standards.

NNE will use Baker Hughes LUMEN Terrain continuous emissions monitoring technology at one of its well pads to certify production under the MiQ methane standard. Northeast explains that the standard is independent third-party audited quantitative and graded across a sliding A-F scale based on three metrics: Methane intensity company practices and methane detection technology deployment.

Equitable Origin is a nonprofit that certifies energy production in accordance with its EO100 Standard for Responsible Energy Development. Equitable Origin-approved assessors will evaluate Northeast against the five principles: Corporate governance and ethics; social impacts human rights and community engagement; Indigenous Peoples’ rights; occupational health and safety and fair labor standards; and environmental impacts biodiversity and climate change.

Matt Sheppard owner of Sheppard Communication Strategies notified The Dominion Post of Northeast’s efforts and said Northeast will be the first natural gas exploration company in West Virginia and the first in the entire Marcellus region to have its entire operating field certified under the dual standards.

Northeast is a dry gas producer John said meaning just methane. “We’re excited about the concept of measurement of demonstrating to everyone ‘Let’s all be measured let’s all be transparent to what we do and how we do it.’ … We’re confident that we’re going to score very highly.”

Brett Loflin vice president of regulatory affairs said the EO100 will be an expensive process involving a self-assessment questionnaire. They also will send out an auditor interview employees look at the field operations and review documentation to substantiate the self-assessment.

The emissions portion is a pilot project and they may do some aerial surveys in the future he said. “That will obviously help us in the long run and we’ll know better how to improve and how to monitor our other pads.” He added that they have conducted leak detection and repair since they drilled their first well.

Northeast’s goal they said is to certify its entire field for ESG standards.

”This is an ongoing thing. This is not a one-time check a box” John said. “This is a commitment to ongoing evaluation and measurement of what we do to continue to refine our processes to continue to improve what we do.”

In the context of environmental responsibility The Dominion Post asked about a Department of Environmental Protection settlement of administrative consent order issued in June.

John said that the violations were tied to sediment in ephemeral streams associated with building a water line from the Monongahela River. A third-party consultant has been hired to inspect operations daily for erosion sediment control.

John said “We understand and accept that the environmental impact of what we do is going to continue to be the focus of most folks so we need to make sure it’s our focus.”

Northeast’s 2021 Sustainability Report notes that the company already has met its 2025 goal of reducing methane emissions to less than 1%. From 2017 to 2019 it has decreased emissions by 38% while increasing production 110%. All operations begin every shift with a pre-job safety meeting and each employee and contractor has stop-work authority.

She also remembers how much she loved her children.

""My childhood was very loving"" she tells 9Honey. ""I remember my mum was always working and studying and she also had her three kids so life was super busy"".

Eloise is the youngest of the three and was just 13 when her mother Janet died in 2002 and her brothers were aged 15 and 20.

""Now I've got a one year old I think about her constantly"" she says. ""I think of her every day.""

Eloise grew up in Box Hill in Melbourne. Her ""very clever"" mother was a business analyst at Medibank Private and outside of her work hours was studying accounting.

The day of her mother's death Eloise learned she was on her way home from work and stopped off to buy flowers for her mother's birthday.

""We were meant to go to dinner that night"" she says. ""She had a heart attack at the florist. She collapsed and an ambulance was called. The poor florist did CPR for 20 minutes but I think she'd already pretty much passed away. Her heart had stopped and they managed to kick start it again.

""At the hospital they worked on her for five hours before she was transferred to the ICU. She was on life support for two days before she died.""

Her father later told Eloise he was meant to pick her up from the train station but she never arrived. He kept trying to call her and eventually a staff member at the hospital answered.

""We didn't turn off the life support she just passed away"" Eloise recalls. ""We didn't get to say goodbye because she was unconscious.""

Janet had been diagnosed with Myocarditis inflammation of the heart muscle. (Supplied)

""They think maybe two weeks before she caught some sort of cold or virus but obviously I was so young I don't remember everything being such a trauma it was wiped from my memory any events prior to her death.""

Prior to her death her mother had been diagnosed with Myocarditis inflammation of the heart muscle.

""The poor florist did CPR for 20 minutes but I think she'd already pretty much passed away.""

Eloise says it was ""quite hard to get over"" the death of her mother and adding to her struggle with it following the birth of daughter Matilda one was the loss of her nan Hilda in 2020 at the age of 94.

Hilda had stepped in to help care for her grandchildren following her daughter's death.

Before her death Eloise remembers cooking breakfast in bed for her mum each Mother's Day.

""I have a lot of cute memories of growing up"" she says.

Following her mother's death the family would gather with Hilda to remember her.

""I often buy her favourite flowers - irises and pansies - and she loved a skinny cappuccino so sometimes I'll order one and have a champagne for her.""

This will be Eloise's second Mother's Day.

Hilda got to meet Matilda shortly before her death in 2020. (Supplied)

""I really wanted to have a girl because I wanted to have that mother-daughter relationship that I lost with my mum dying so young"" she says. ""I just appreciate every day with her. It's such a blessing.""

Eloise is sharing her story for this year's Draw Her Wings campaign which sees motherless daughters craft a set of angel wings in memory of their mother and share it on social media.

To support important causes and campaigns like Motherless Daughters Australia amaysim has launched their Big Love Legends program to shine a light on the positive impact that its customers are having in their own communities.

Eminent banking executive dedicated philanthropist and beloved husband father grandfather and uncle William John “Bill” Reuter passed away on May 5 2021.

Born June 2 1949 Bill was raised in East Baltimore where he attended Our Lady of Fatima parochial school followed by Archbishop Curley High School.

His successful school career included graduating from the University of Maryland School of Banking and receiving his bachelor’s degree from the University of Baltimore. He also received an honorary doctorate degree from Millersville University.

He married his high school sweetheart Selina and the union lasted 53 years until Bill passed. Their marriage produced three children and five grandchildren.

Bill was preceded in death by his parents William F. and Dolores Reuter; and his brother Donald J. Reuter.

He is survived by his wife Selina A. Reuter; his children Lisa Fink (Gary) William B. Reuter and Jason J. Reuter (Erin); and his grandchildren Nicholas Custodero William Reuter (Blake) Jason K. Reuter Zhen Reuter and Rayn Reuter.

Bill’s greatest love was his family. He adored spending time with them being their role model and offering a constant source of love and support. In his own words the things he valued most included: “Honesty character integrity hard work not being something you’re not being realistic reaching out touching people’s lives.”

He was proud to have served his country in the U.S. Air Force; after 23 years he retired as master sergeant with the Maryland Air National Guard.

Professionally Bill spent more than 45 years in the banking industry. His career started in 1973 at Equitable Bank in Baltimore Md. In 1989 he became the president and chief executive officer of Farmers and Merchants Bank in Hagerstown Md. Later Farmers and Merchants was acquired by Susquehanna Bancshares based in Lititz Pa. and Bill became chairman and president in 1997. In 2002 he was appointed chairman president and chief executive officer. He retired from his role with Susquehanna Bancshares in 2015 and went on to serve on the board of directors for BB&T from 2015 to 2019.

Bill had a lifelong sense of civic responsibility and held numerous leadership positions with nonprofits and charities. Though he relocated due to his professional positions he always enriched and served the communities in which he lived. His philanthropic commitments were many and he served on the board of several organizations including the Maryland Symphony Orchestra the Greater Hagerstown Committee (he was a charter member) Meritus Health (formerly Washington County Hospital system) and Hagerstown Community College.

Groups that he volunteered with included (but were not limited to): the Pennsylvania Bankers Association; the Maryland Bankers Association; the New Jersey Bankers Association; the Bank Administration Institute; the United Way of Lancaster County Pa. (where he served as chairman in 2006 and was the recipient of the Thomas H. Bamford Volunteer of the Year Award in 2008); the United Way of Washington County Md. (he was the recipient of the Jesse L. Kagle Distinguished Service Award in 1992); The Maryland Theatre in Hagerstown; the Maryland Chamber of Commerce of Washington County; the Community Foundation of Washington County Md.; Leadership Maryland-Leadership Washington County; the Young Bank Presidents of America; the Jaycees of Baltimore; the Special Olympics; the Economic Development Company of Lancaster Pa.; The Lancaster Alliance; and Archbishop Curley High School in Baltimore. He also received recognition from the U.S. Small Business Administration Hagerstown Rotary Club Hagerstown YMCA and was named the 1995 Business Person of the Year by the Hagerstown-Washington County Chamber of Commerce.

An avid golfer Bill loved playing at different courses but his home greens were particularly close to his heart: Fountain Head Country Club Bent Creek Country Club Caves Valley and Grey Oaks. He served as club president at both Fountain Head Country Club and Bent Creek.

Bill’s legacy of service and selfless dedication will live on always. In the words of Thucydides: “What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments but what is woven into the lives of others.”

Guests are invited to pay their respects to the Reuter family at Charles F. Snyder Funeral Home and Crematory 3110 Lititz Pike Lititz PA 17543 on Sunday May 9 2021 from 2 to 4 p.m. and 6 to 8 p.m.

They Want You Back At Work.,"If you’ve been thrust into working from home for the last year-plus your routine of Zoom calls walking the dog at lunch and avoiding seeing your boss in person are likely to be coming to an end.

With more people being vaccinated and life returning to a semblance of normal many employers around Charlotte are quietly laying the groundwork to try to make their workplaces more like normal too.

It’s a tricky time for companies as they work to assess changing government rules shifting health guidance and drastically different employee expectations while trying to run their businesses efficiently.

Some local companies have set back-to-the-office dates for this summer and even some of Charlotte’s largest employers have started making noises about bringing workers back. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said last month that the bank is a “work-from-office company because the productivity and the culture and mentoring that can take place is just better” and that the bank will be “generally moving toward being back to normal” after Labor Day.

The Ledger talked with local employment lawyers human resources advisers and others about some of the key issues related to returning to the office in-person — and what that might look like when it happens.

Timeline: Smaller Companies Back Earlier

Although Charlotte’s big banks seem to be eyeing a return around Labor Day many small and mid-sized companies are headed back to the office sooner setting deadlines of bringing everyone back by June 1 or July 1. That’s because with fewer workers it’s easier to make it happen logistically. And unlike a major bank a 15-person insurance office doesn’t have to worry about making headlines when it happens.

“If you see a big financial institution come back in September we’ll see the small and medium-sized companies start to beat that” says Brett Gray managing principal in the Charlotte office of Cushman & Wakefield a real estate services firm. “They’re starting to come back in.”

Of course some companies already have allowed workers to return to the office if they want to. Workers’ preferences vary: Some enjoy working from home while others can’t wait to get out of the house. Expect more encouragement if not requirements to head back to work. Many employers believe that “this idea of bringing people back whenever they feel like it defeats the purpose of creativity of working with your team” Gray says.

Schedule: Probably Not Full-Time All At Once

Most employers probably won’t demand that their entire workforces show up in the office full-time on Day 1. With social distancing guidelines still in place that could be tricky. Most seem to be adopting a hybrid approach at least initially though that requires a lot of planning and discussions with individual employees.

What If You Don’t Want To Go Back?

One of the biggest questions employers are asking Kenny Colbert co-CEO of Catapult (formerly The Employers Association) is what to do about workers who have grown too comfortable staying home.

“A lot of people are saying ‘I just don’t want to come back at all because I have gotten used to this work-at-home lifestyle wearing my pajamas all day long and not fighting traffic and not spending a lot of money’” he says.

It’s a dicey question for employers Colbert says because while they could probably legally force workers to return on the threat of being fired the tight job market is making a lot of companies back off from pushing the issue. “Good people can find jobs somewhere else” he says. “If you’re not meeting the needs of your workers you’re at risk of losing some good people right now.”

Vaccinations: Probably Not Required

Employment lawyers say the main questions they get from companies continue to be whether they can require employees to be vaccinated. The answer is usually “yes” — but businesses need to make sure they allow exceptions on religious and health grounds which could be a legal minefield. As a result many are not requiring vaccinations.

“Everybody is scared to death of asking anything that they think has anything to do with a health-related issue” says Grainger Pierce an employment lawyer with Van Hoy Reutlinger Adams & Pierce. Bosses can ask if workers have been vaccinated but they shouldn’t ask for additional information on why not unless they are making vaccinations mandatory. Some companies are offering incentives to workers who are vaccinated which is fine Pierce says.

Masks: You’ll Probably Have To Wear Them

North Carolina’s mask mandate remains in effect and Gov. Roy Cooper has said it will continue until at least two-thirds of N.C. adults have received at least one vaccination. Right now the figure is at about 50% and at the current pace it could take a while.

Under the current executive order  masks are required in office settings in which there are people from different households.

Meredith Jeffries an employment lawyer with Alexander Ricks says that she has received questions from employers asking if masks are required even if 100% of the company’s workforce is vaccinated. The answer is yes. “The governor’s orders do not make any exceptions for being vaccinated” she says.

Office Configuration: No Major Changes

Although some companies have thought about shaking up their office layouts most are taking a wait-and-see approach to big changes. “They’re saying ‘We don’t want to go blow up the office unless we have to” Gray says. Some companies with expiring leases or new construction already underway might have more unassigned desks flexible layouts and work pods but most firms are in long-term leases and aren’t making changes to existing office furniture or set-ups.

And they’re still continuing to follow recommendations for stepped-up cleaning he says.

Office Attire: 'Slightly More Comfortable And Casual'

Sorry athleisure lovers. It’s time to trade the yoga pants and workout shorts of COVID-19 for real work clothes.

Jon Simon president of Paul Simon Co. which has men’s and women’s clothing shops in the Village at SouthPark said he expects both men and women will want to dress well when they head back to the office for two reasons: They’ll be jockeying for position with both their bosses and clients and they’re tired of casual COVID-19 attire.

Still he’s seeing a nod toward slightly more comfortable and casual work clothes.

What does that look like? Simon said to expect to see more pullover knit shirts with sports jackets casual five-pocket pants instead of dress pants and dress shoes with rubber soles. He said 90% of the men’s pants he’s selling now are five-pocket pants which made up 60% of his pants business pre-COVID-19.

“Most business leaders will set office dress expectations geared toward getting the most productivity out of their workers and having a professional-looking staff” Simon told The Ledger.

Simon said he’s been hearing the same refrain from customers for the last three months: They’re tired of Zoom tired of mixing their work and home lives and tired of not dressing well for other people.

“They are excited to put on nice clothes again” he said.

Kennedy Boulevard in Center City is an astonishing 548-foot tall structure that was completed in 1901 (though occupation first started in 1877) at the intersection of Market Street and Broad Street. The nine-story structure is the world’s tallest freestanding masonry building and has a lovely Second Empire style architecture (also known as Napoleon III style) with the municipal floors and the clock tower decked out with decorative cornices and pillars. The building was designed by John McArthur Jr. and Thomas Ustick Walter. McArthur has also designed the First National Bank and Walter was the fourth architect of the Capitol building in Washington DC having designed the Capitol dome on top of the Capitol Building.

Construction started in 1871 at a site that was once home to a large park called Center Square one of William Penn’s and Thomas Holme’s five original parks formed within the city layout in 1682 four of which still remain. The building is clad in limestone granite marble and glass making the structure stand out during the day with its bright materials. The municipal and office floors wrap around an open courtyard that is accessed through four corridors on each side. In the middle of the north side stands the clock tower which is topped by the 37-foot-tall William Penn statue. The 53348-pound statue was lifted in 14 sections in 1894 making the tower the tallest office building in the world until the Singer Building in New York City took the title in 1908.

For nearly a century after completion a “gentlemen’s agreement” restricted buildings from rising above the height of the William Penn statue was eliminated in 1984 with the approval of One Commerce Square which topped out at 565 feet in 1986. In the same year City Hall was covered in 15 stories of scaffolding and had its wooden components within the clock tower replaced with steel to avoid structural failure. In September 1986 the steel beams of Independence Blue Cross Tower Three Logan Square Two Liberty Place and BNY Mellon Center had joined the skyline by 1990 with the top of the clock tower being uncovered in the summer.

Silver prices surged to an eight-year high in January after retail investors piled into exchange traded funds holding the precious metal. But their mistaken reasons for doing so — and subsequent losses — have led to renewed debate about silver’s role in investors’ portfolios.

Around $1bn flowed into silver-backed ETFs on a single day in January after comments on the Reddit online forum called WallStreetBets erroneously suggested that US investment banks were suppressing the price of the metal. This encouraged a group of investors to try to oppose the banks by buying silver ETFs to push up the metal’s price. Reddit users were exhorted to buy into the funds to create losses for investment banks such JPMorgan as “payback for the bailouts and manipulation”.

In that same month the Reddit forum had urged investors to buy shares in retailer GameStop for a similar reason: to force losses on hedge funds that were betting on a fall in the share price.

Experienced market participants were horrified by the statements about silver which triggered frenzied buying of the iShares Silver Trust requiring it to increase the number of shares in issue by 37.05m or 6.1 per cent on January 29. This was the biggest one-day increase since the ETF started trading in April 2006.

Shares in the ETF are 100 per cent backed by physical silver held in secure vaults so it has to purchase more of the metal whenever it receives new investments. Prices for silver coins bars and mining company shares also rose.

However Ross Norman a veteran precious metals trader warned at the time that Reddit users were on “a fool’s errand”. He was proved right when the buying abated and the silver price dropped from just above $30 an ounce at the end of January to $26.33 within a week. Norman estimated that retail investors lost $250m during the correction.

It marked another chapter in the chequered history of the “devil’s metal” — so named for its price volatility and capacity to create painful losses. But might it be repeated?

Chris Mellor head of ETF equity and commodity product management in Europe at Invesco says a repeat of the “Redditor” spike is unlikely. Instead he sees the overall rise in silver prices from the middle of last year as evidence of genuine investor appetite for an asset that was out of favour for much of the past decade.

Silver is poised to benefit from its use in solar panels electric vehicles and charging points

“Investors have been buying silver for similar reasons as gold” argues Mellor. “Silver provides a potential safe-haven asset in the depths of a crisis a portfolio diversifying asset and as protection against the risk of renewed inflation.”

This rising investor demand pushed ETFs’ silver holdings up by a record 10229 tonnes last year — more than double the previous record increase which came in 2009 after the global financial crisis. It also pushed total silver holdings in ETFs beyond 1bn ounces for the first time reaching 1.07bn ounces (33182 tonnes) by the end of December 2020 according to the Silver Institute a trade association.

Inflows are expected to slow to 4666 tonnes in 2021 but that is still a big increase by historic standards. Slowing investor demand will be offset by increased industrial usage say analysts.

“Silver’s growing use in electronics and in photovoltaics (solar panels) should buttress demand as the energy transition and electrification of our energy systems gathers pace” reckons Nitesh Shah research director at WisdomTree the New York-listed asset manager.

US president Joe Biden’s plan to spend $2.3tn on US infrastructure will also bolster industrial demand for silver according to Suki Cooper precious metals analyst at Standard Chartered bank in New York.

“Silver is poised to benefit from its use in solar panels electric vehicles and charging points” explains Cooper.

Nevertheless Standard Chartered is forecasting that the price of silver will ease from an average $30 an ounce in the final quarter of this year to an average $25 an ounce in 2022 due to weaker investment demand and increased supply.

James Steel HSBC’s chief precious metals analyst also cautions that improvements in industrial demand for silver will be offset by a “very strong rebound” in mine output in 2021 following widespread production disruptions due to the pandemic. He adds that silver jewellery demand has been hit by the coronavirus too particularly in the key Indian market.

HSBC is therefore forecasting that the price of silver will be down to about $24.90 an ounce by the end this year — it was $25.92 at the end of April — due in part to lower investor demand. The recent rally means silver “no longer looks like a bargain” compared with gold warns Steel.

Still he believes investor demand will not disappear given worries about ultra-low interest rates expanding central bank balance sheets increases in fiscal spending and rising debt levels. “These factors will not necessarily drive the silver price higher but they will raise support levels and cushion any corrections” concludes Steel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHlhbS5jb20vc3F1YXJlLW1pbGVzLWxhcmdlc3QtZW1wbG95ZXJzLWVtYnJhY2UtaHlicmlkLXdvcmtpbmctdGhlLWRldGFpbHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Square Mile's largest employers embrace hybrid working the details - CityAM,"Square Mile’s largest employers embrace hybrid working the details

London

The majority of the largest employers in the City of London have vowed to continue with some sort of hybrid approach to working after pandemic-led restrictions forced the biggest home working experiment in history.

With Covid-19 cases falling and millions of people successfully vaccinated staff are trickling back into London’s offices and companies are turning their attention to what the workplace will look like when government guidance around home working eases.

If countless surveys are to be believed most employees have reported enjoying the flexibility of working from home.

Not having to commute to the office five days a week has been welcomed and many feel their work-life balance has improved as a result of spending more time at home.

However employees also appear largely in agreement that collaboration is more challenging remotely. ‘Zoom fatigue’ is a real phenomenon and some staff have reported missing their colleagues and the idle chit-chat that comes with office life.

It is perhaps unsurprising then that the vast majority of the Square Mile’s biggest employers are leaning towards the hybrid model for the post-pandemic world.

City A.M. canvassed the Square Mile’s 10 largest employers by office size to find out what a week day in the City of London might look like after Covid-19 restrictions are eased.

Though the finer details are still being worked out at most of the firms – and many bosses are awaiting guidance from the government – the majority plan to continue to grant staff more flexibility over where they work.

BoE to embrace hybrid working

City A.M. understands the Bank of England – the Square Miles’ third largest occupier of floor space according to July 2020 data from the City of London Corporation – is moving to a hybrid model and is in the process of reviewing its approach to work with the ‘new normal’ in mind.

Japanese holding company Nomura is also understood to be moving to a hybrid way of working with corporate staff expected to be in the office for around 50 per cent of the time.

Big Four firm Deloitte like rivals PwC and KPMG is also going down the hybrid route with a spokesperson saying: “We will continue to look at how we enable flexibility for our people to work where when and how they wish to.

“Our hybrid working model will also see continued investment in our office space design to facilitate collaboration connection and innovation for both our people and our clients.”

Deutsche Bank too is actively working towards a hybrid model and is in consultation with employees to work out the finer details on what that might look like.

A spokesperson for the German investment bank said most staff will be offered the chance to work remotely two to three days per week after 90 per cent of staff that responded to an internal survey said they wanted some degree of remote working following the pandemic.

UBS – 796000 square feet

Bank of England – 709000 square feet

Deloitte – 536000 square feet

Nomura – 500000 square feet

CMS – 220000 square feet

JP Morgan Chase – 360000 square feet

M&G – 332000 square feet

Deutsche Bank – 312000 square feet

Schroders – 310000 square feet

Bank of New York Mellon – 300000 square feet

Staff at BNY Mellon meanwhile will not be expected back into the office until “at least” September according to a spokesperson.

During its Q1 earnings announcement BNY Mellon CEO Todd Gibbons said the bank would embrace hybrid working arrangements post-pandemic after a successful year.

“We’ve proven our ability to maintain high-quality service for our clients adopt and deploy new technologies quickly” he said speaking of pandemic-led changes at the bank.

“We’ve collaborated with one another virtually over this past year. We’re going to take the best of what we’ve learned to continue to innovate and drive enhanced value for our clients and our employees including assessing what our workforce and workplaces will look like.”

Asset manager Schroders last year announced it had embraced “permanent flexible working” for staff.

“We believe re-thinking the rulebook on flexibility will ultimately prove a huge shot in the arm for Schroders’ productivity in the long term while also highlighting Schroders as a forward-thinking employer of choice” global head of HR Emma Holden said at the time.

Similarly it will be business as usual at CMS as the international law firm operated a flexible model before the pandemic.

A spokesperson said: “Recognising that everyone’s circumstances are different we continue to encourage our staff and lawyers to discuss with their managers the support they need.

“We have always supported and continue to support agile and flexible working.”

City A.M. was unable to get a response from investment manager M&G however last summer it said it wanted to make savings by extending remote working beyond the duration of the crisis with staff expected to come to the office no more than two or three days a week according to the Financial Times.

Caution around the ‘new normal’

Not all of the Square Mile’s 10 largest offices plan to embrace flexible or hybrid working with such gusto.

For Goldman Sachs the employer with the largest footprint in the City of London hybrid working will soon be a thing of the past.

Goldman Sachs employees in the UK will return to the office by 21 June in line with the government’s easing of lockdown that should see the UK largely restriction-free.

In an internal memo circulated among staff and seen by City A.M. chief executive David Solomon said: “We know from experience that our culture of collaboration innovation and apprenticeship thrives when our people come together.”

In what looks like a more moderate adoption of flexible working Swiss investment bank UBS – the Square Mile’s second larger occupier of floor space – is understood to be offering “case-by-case” flexibility to employees.

Speaking to Bloomberg earlier this month chairman Axel Weber said he saw “very little need to be in a race to get back to the office” and that the new normal would see a greater number of people in the office but there would be no hard-and-fast rules around it.

However he said critical and high-risk roles like traders were likely to return to the office.

For JP Morgan many of its roles will continue to be performed full-time in the office including retail bank staff as well as jobs in vaults lockbox sales and trading critical operations functions and facilities amenities security medical staff and many others.

However “some” employees will work under a hybrid model and around 10 per cent of staff overall will work from home full time.",,,

Jessica Biel just shared what she did to get ready for this year's Met Gala and it's definitely...unusual.

""I know some people like to party before the Met ball and party all weekend and all the things and I have total respect for that"" the 42-year-old shared while wearing a white fluffy robe in a TikTok video. ""This is what I do to get ready for the Met ball"" she continued before counting bags of Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt perched on the side of a tub.

""Twenty pounds of Epsom salt in a bath"" she said before dumping the bags into a bath. ""With water as hot as you can take it. Thirty-minute soak [the] night before"" she said. ""Drink tons of water then and off to bed early.""

The comments of Biel's video were packed with messages from people who wondered whether this was safe — and why she even did it in the first place. ""Genuine question here: What's the purpose of this?"" one person wrote. ""I once panicked because I used five cups instead of the recommended four"" another said. ""Wow that's a lot of salt!"" someone else chimed in.

Epsom salt baths are typically used to lower pain and inflammation but it's fair to wonder about things like skin irritation and dehydration if you're surrounding yourself with that much salt. Before you run yourself a bath we tapped three doctors to weigh in Biel's practice — and whether or not it's actually safe.



Is Bathing in 20 Pounds of Epsom Salt Safe?

Epsom salt is a naturally-occurring mineral salt that's a compound of magnesium and sulfate per the Cleveland Clinic. There are no definitive studies to support this but fans swear that Epsom salt baths allow the magnesium and sulfate to be absorbed into your body through your skin. According to claims Epsom salt baths can help with muscle pain bloat and even stress levels.

But most people recommend using much much less Epsom salt than 20 pounds. ""I would not recommend using 20 pounds of Epsom salt— that seems a bit excessive"" says Ife J. Rodney MD dermatologist and founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics.

Gary Goldenberg MD a board-certified dermatologist practicing in New York City also used the word ""excessive"" to describe Biel's practice.

That said it's possible to bathe in that much Epsom salt and feel fine Dr. Rodney tells PS. There is a low risk of getting sick from bathing in this much Epsom salt ""unless you have sensitive skin and are prone to rashes"" says women's health expert Jennifer Wider MD (more on this later!).

How Much Epsom Salt Is Too Much?

There's no hard and fast science on this but the directions for Dr. Teal's Pure Epsom Salt recommend pouring ""at least two cups"" of Epsom salts under warm running bath water and soaking for 20 minutes to relieve sore muscles.

""Two cups in a bath full of water is ideal"" Dr. Rodney says. ""I don't recommend higher than this.""

What Are the Potential Benefits of Epsom Salt?

Again it's not entirely clear how effective Epsom salt is but some doctors will recommend Epsom salt baths to help with a range of things including to ease muscle soreness tamp down on bloat and pamper skin.

""Epsom salt is magnesium and sulfate which has been shown to ease inflammation and soothe dry rough skin"" Dr. Rodney says. ""Anybody with rough skin dryness or an inflammatory skin condition like psoriasis may benefit from this.""

Dr. Goldenberg agrees. ""Epsom salt can help moisturize the skin and help smooth the skin"" he says. It may also help you chill out. ""People have taken Epsom salt baths for hundreds of years as a means of relaxation"" Wider says.

What Are the Risks of Epsom Salt?

When used as directed Dr. Rodney says there aren't many risks associated with taking an Epsom salt bath. But if you have it in excessive amounts it could bother your skin. ""If you're soaking in such a high salt concentration for a long period of time it could cause a rash and irritation"" she says.

Soaking in a high concentration of Epsom salt could also ""affect the fluid balance in your body"" potentially leading to dehydration Dr. Rodney says. If you ingested high amounts of Epsom salts — which Biel didn't do — you would be at risk of diarrhea dizziness and an irregular heartbeat Dr. Wider tells PS.

While doctors say you're just fine to have a bath with two or so cups of Epsom salts they don't recommend taking it to the same extreme as Biel. As with most things in life it's best to enjoy Epsom salt in moderation.

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

Whimsical wordplay aside the question would become a serious one for mid-century America as parsons and priests blamed jazz for soaring juvenile crime rates drugs and extramarital sex. A 1960 poll found that among Black preachers just 1 in 5 wanted to let jazz or blues into their services. Decades before a religion editor at the Pittsburgh Courier had denounced Louis Armstrong’s “sacrilegious desecration of Spirituals.” Duke Ellington’s music was “considered worldly” counseled the Rev. John D. Bussey explaining why the local 1966 Baptist Ministers Conference had unanimously passed his resolution opposing a performance.

But whatever commandments they were breaking—and there were plenty from slighting the Sabbath to serial adultery—Duke Louis and king of swing Count Basie all seemed to take the Christian faith they’d been raised in seriously. And that faith found its way into their music.

For Louis Armstrong the connection was there from the very beginning when he learned to sing in his mother’s Sanctified church. “The ‘whole ‘Congregation would be “Wailing—‘Singing like ‘mad and ‘sound so ‘beautiful” he wrote with his characteristic expressive idiosyncratic punctuation. “I’d have myself a ‘Ball in ‘Church especially when those ‘Sisters ‘would get ‘So ‘Carried away while ‘Rev’ would be ‘right in the ‘Middle of his ‘Sermon. ‘Man those ‘Church ‘Sisters would ‘begin ‘Shouting ‘So—until their ‘petticoats would ‘fall off. … My heart went into every hymn I sang” he added. “I am still a great believer and I go to church whenever I get the chance.”

With Saturday night performances that stretched into Sundays that wasn’t often. But nearly half a century later Armstrong released an album the church sisters would have loved Louis and the Good Book with gassed-up versions of spirituals including “Go Down Moses” and “Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen.” He recorded “When the Saints” the anthem of the Big Easy more than 100 times.

Count Basie was raised in the Black church too. Two of his uncles were ministers; his father was a founder and pillar of Pilgrim Baptist Church in Red Bank New Jersey. In oral histories and writings fellow musicians and friends use the word spiritual to describe what Basie brought to the band. Sideman Harry “Sweets” Edison compared their group to church organists and singers who inspire congregants to “get up to shout.” Basie was a spiritual presence offstage too. “Prior to eating he would do this elaborate silent prayer” recalls tenor saxophonist Eric Schneider. If the food came before he was finished “it was understood that we should go ahead and eat.”

Duke Ellington was perhaps the most pious of the three maestros. Growing up he attended two services each Sunday: African Methodist Episcopal Zion with his father Baptist with his mother. As a young man he consulted the Bible twice a day sometimes taking the book into the bathtub and reading until the water got cold. Though he shunned most jewelry he wore a gold crucifix around his neck and carried a St. Christopher medal in his hip pocket. His Christmas card bore a simple message in gold lettering: LOVE GOD.

In the last ten years of his life Ellington devoted himself to a series of sacred concerts performances that brought together jazz and classical music spirituals gospel and the blues. Suddenly he was getting more invitations to play in churches than in dance halls. Synagogues too. “These are things people don’t know about him” said singer-songwriter Herb Jeffries. “He had a great ministry. It was hidden in his music. … He was practicing his ministry moving about here and there making people happy!” When a reporter asked how he “as a religious man” could “play in dark dingy places where depravity and drunkenness reign” Ellington whispered “Isn’t that exactly what Christ did—went into the places where people were bringing light into darkness?”

He also pushed back against preachers who accused him of defiling their churches with his concerts. “Some people ask me what prompted me to write the music for the sacred concerts. I have done so not as a matter of career but in response to a growing understanding of my own vocation” Ellington wrote in his memoir. “I think of myself as a messenger boy one who tries to bring messages to people not people who have never heard of God but those who were more or less raised with the guidance of the church.” The sacred concerts this most accomplished of composers and bandleaders added were “the most important thing I have ever done.” They were important to audiences too. Take the girl who approached Ellington after one performance telling him “You know Duke you made me put my cross back on!”

Sacrilegious then isn’t the word to describe these jazzmen. Yes their faith was unorthodox and imperfect. But it also was warmly ecumenical and personally sustaining. You can hear it not just in their Christmas tunes but in all of their jazz music rooted in the gospels and Negro spirituals they grew up with. Their abiding belief in God all three maestros made clear is what emboldened and empowered them to write the soundtrack to the Civil Rights revolution to shape the soul of America.

According to his son Mercer Duke Ellington “was quite taken with the story of the ‘Juggler of Notre Dame.’” It’s a parable that applies to Armstrong and Basie too. “The man was a great juggler who would sneak into the church and juggle before the altar. As the story goes the priests found out about it and kicked him out. God intervened and told the priests to leave him alone. The man was celebrating His presence by using the gifts that He gave him.”

Health Department fills a syringe with Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Read more

In the early stages of the COVID pandemic as most of the world sought hope amid soaring death tolls and sinking economies a New Jersey company looked ahead and readied itself for the moment when a medical solution would arrive.

Anticipating the development of vaccines as well as a red-hot worldwide demand for its products Becton Dickinson the world’s leading syringe manufacturer ramped up production at plants in the U.S. Asia and Europe early in 2020.

Hundreds of millions of orders poured in from across the globe and in response the Franklin Lakes-based company produced 1 billion more needles and syringes than in a typical year an increase of more than 2000 a minute.

“There was such an aggressive time frame for the vaccines that governments wanted them by the end of 2020 or early 2021” said Troy Kirkpatrick a BD vice president. “We tried to push out as many as we could. By the end of last year we had more than 300 million delivered around the world.”

In the fight against COVID the hastily developed vaccines are the stars of the story. But the inoculation of billions also requires billions of syringes and BD and its competitors here and abroad have been working overtime to churn them out.

“This is the type of global health challenge BD was built to address” CEO Tom Polen wrote in a letter to shareholders.

The company which manufactures medical devices medical supplies lab equipment and diagnostic products has 70000 employees and operations in 50 countries. It reported $17.1 billion in revenue in 2020 with sales of its syringes and other injection devices accounting for $3.6 billion. Its stock closed at $239.39 on Friday just a little higher than three years ago.

Most of America’s COVID needles come from BD’s four Nebraska plants and one in Connecticut places that already were operating around the clock to make the injection devices needed for annual flu shots childhood vaccines and everyday medical uses.

“That’s why we started contacting governments so early” said Kirkpatrick. “When you’re going to need billions of additional devices even for a company like ours that already makes multiple billions it takes time. And we didn’t want to impact existing production.”

Despite the surge BD has hired very few new workers according to spokesperson Alyssa Kretlow instead tweaking existing procedures to accommodate the additional output.

“For some new lines there might have been increases in the work force but in general those facilities were already going 24-7” said Kretlow. “What we’ve been really able to do to is use our flexibility and offer our employees additional training.”

While BD has produced conventional 1- and 3-milliliter syringes for this vaccination effort it’s also made millions of low dead-volume syringes which are designed to minimize empty spaces and limit waste.

A recent Food and Drug Administration ruling permitted low dead-volume syringes to extract six doses from each vaccine vial. Traditional needles had a maximum of five.

Made of stainless steel and plastic or glass the syringes are packed and shipped not to pharmaceutical firms to be filled with medication but to federal government warehouses where they are then distributed to states either in bulk or as part of pre-packaged vaccine kits.

“Traditionally we go through distributors and then our customers order through them” Kirkpatrick said. “But with COVID it’s been the government placing the orders and doing the distributing.”

Shipped in glass vials most of the COVID vaccines require refrigeration. BD’s needles arrived at their destinations empty unlike those that are pre-filled and used for say flu shots. That required a new learning curve for many countries especially in Europe.

“In Europe where there are mostly state-run health systems the governments were used to buying vaccines for their populations” said Kirkpatrick. “But almost all were given in pre-filled format. They never had to worry about ordering the injection system separately. So we had to educate them.”

Most of these COVID devices used in the U.S. also have safety caps to prevent accidental sticks a necessary precaution since so many of those working at the sites have never administered shots before.

Founded in 1897 BD produced the first hypodermic needle used for insulin injections as well as the first disposable syringe. Its first major acquisition in 1904 was the Philadelphia Surgical Co. Major competitors in the injection-device market now include American firms like Retractable Technologies Inc. Smiths Medical Inc. Cardinal Health as well as several Chinese manufacturers.

While the COVID-generated surge has helped its bottom line Kirkpatrick said the BD-produced item that had the biggest impact last year was a new diagnostic test.

“While we’re certainly seeing an increase in syringe sales” he said “the rapid and molecular COVID tests we developed actually did better for us.”

BD recently partnered with the U.S. government on a $70 million expansion of its manufacturing capacity at the Nebraska plants. That will allow the U.S. to stockpile the devices for future outbreaks.

Here's Why He's Right,"Today’s corporate virtue signaling is the 1990s version of greenwashing given that the promotion of doing ‘good’ is superseding outcomes derived from it.

Nevertheless the impetus for addressing environmental social and governance (ESG) issues as depicted within the UN’s Sustainability Goals is proving itself to be a global mandate for firms of all types. This is worrisome given the limited understanding of long-term implications or even proper forms of their application.

Warren Buffet renowned investor and philanthropist has even had reservations regarding ESG standards and just this week he opposed proposals for annual reports on climate change and diversity initiatives. His stance is running counter to Wall Street’s expectations given the growing attractiveness of investing in sustainable ventures.

The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the World Economic Forum (WEF) support efforts for establishing “a globally accepted system for corporate disclosure” to report ESG information in addition to financial performance. The WEF attests that businesses are adjusting strategies according to environmental and social factors at a remarkable pace and pressure for urgent action is mounting as the espoused ethos of the Great Reset promulgates and the setbacks from the pandemic unveil sustainability shortcomings.

The implementation of ESG metrics and the adoption of new tools for combating global challenges sounds admirable but it is important to note that what benefits the planet and what benefits people rarely align in perfect harmony.

For instance a community impact initiative that benefits the livelihoods of people (such as investing in irrigation systems for improving food security) could have an adverse environmental impact (disrupting the natural state of the water cycle). And it goes without saying that any initiative has an economic impact and so consideration must be given to resource constraints and opportunity costs.

Infamously Patagonia’s Black Friday New York Times advertisement of “Don’t Buy this Jacket” perfectly highlighted the ethical dilemma of production practices by demonstrating the equifinality of a firm’s environmental impact.

Humanity is inherently disruptive to nature and nature is usually not conducive to human flourishing without adjustments being made. To stay warm cool and safe is a primary concern for those without modern luxuries. And yet human-centered approaches to living on this planet can be positioned as unethical practices for Mother Earth (see the Green New Deal).

Given this complexity firms should adhere to Buffett’s advice featured within the Financial Times on “why companies cannot be moral arbiters” and heed his view of ESG spending as being a contestable use of the shareholder’s money.

Advancements in infrastructure and agriculture have propelled human progress to the detriment of biodiversity and environmental concerns continue to attract academic alarmists—and crises callers never quit. In the 1970s focus centered on global cooling and reigning in overpopulation (prompting repressive policies for both resource use and reproduction). Today global warming is center stage and the decline in birthrates is raising concerns due to the costs associated with such trends.

Fortunately Steven Pinker’s acclaimed essay Enlightenment Environmentalism paints a different picture.

“Humanity is not on an irrevocable path to ecological suicide. As the world gets richer and more tech-savvy it dematerializes decarbonizes and densifies sparing land and species. As people get richer and better educated they care more about the environment figure out ways to protect it and are better able to pay the costs” writes Pinker a cognitive psychologist at Harvard University. “Many parts of the environment are rebounding emboldening us to deal with the admittedly severe problems that remain.”

Therefore a people-first approach lends itself to preservation methods.

Clearly there is a need to think reasonably and rationally about how social and environmental issues intersect and given the presence of push pull factors ethics and ecological concerns should not be conjoined. Yet this is what firms are being asked to do when adopting ESG metrics.

Consumer audiences and academics are pressuring firms to go above and beyond traditional forms of corporate social responsibility (CSR) yet neither have a clear understanding of what that means. Historically literature regarding ethical consumption piggybacked on environmental studies and it was common practice for studies on ethical consumer behavior to employ dependent variables relating to environmentalism. The rationale for doing so was based on the assumption that environmentally conscious behavior could be viewed as a subset of the socially conscious category. Therefore in regard to marketing strategies the link between ethics and the environment was not a major issue and environmental and ethical consumers were viewed as one in the same.

The grouping of these two types of consumers has resulted in companies aiming to have a broad appeal regarding sustainability and certification systems tend to attempt a multi-pronged approach. For instance Fairtrade seeks to empower disenfranchised producers combat climate change and prompt policy changes relating to human rights and gender equality. But in trying to solve “all the things” Fairtrade runs into its own roadblocks. For instance the Fairtrade brand is most closely associated with poor farmers given the popularity of certified coffee yet a major issue Fairtrade wishes to address is deforestation which farming is a primary driver of.

Arguments for distinguishing between ethics and the environment have come about over time particularly since ethical concerns serve as a more complex determinant for consumer behavior. Indeed ethics is difficult to measure given that it is culturally and contextually dependent. However what is consistent is that consumers in advanced nations now look beyond price and quality factors when making their purchase decisions and to a greater degree consumption is based on moral principles and conditions of production practices.

The oddity of conscious consumption is that customers may not fully understand why they are willing to buy or pay more for a product featuring a social label. Consumer understanding of what truly makes a product “environmentally friendly” or “socially responsible” tends to be based only on the interpretation of what a company shares and what that consumer is willing to research. The overall valorization relies on people to not only be interested in social marketing but to believe it to be true—and interest is clearly there and sales prove a level of trust is present.

According to Nielsen millennials are contributing to the influx of sales for eco-friendly goods and as for the companies they seek employment from BCG research finds 67 percent of millennials want the companies they work for to have societal impact.

Is it no wonder then that firms are employing marketing strategies for improving the perception of sourcing strategies rather than focusing on improving the product itself. It is not about what the product can do for the consumer but rather what the business is doing for people and the planet.

The charge for stakeholder capitalism from on high along with the desire to cater consumers downstream has made the promotion of sustainability a dominant and lucrative competitive strategy. And sustainability stamps continue to promote certain elements of the supply chain that have a charmed appeal rather than focusing on the linkages of supply-side and demand-side of business transactions that can propel economic development.

Fortunately a more nuanced approach to environmentalism is gaining ground as attention is given to works by Johan Norberg (see Progress: Ten Reasons to Look Forward to the Future) and Michael Shellenberger (see Apocalypse Never: Why Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All).

Overall businesses and their consumers should be mindful of Pinker’s assertion that “In contrast to the lugubrious conventional wisdom offered by the mainstream environmental movement and the radicalism and fatalism it encourages there is a newer conception of environmentalism which shares the goal of protecting the air and water species and ecosystems but is grounded in Enlightenment optimism rather than Romantic declinism. That approach is called ecomodernism.”

For years the question of whom the feted investor would anoint as his successor to run the giant conglomerate has been the subject of boardroom gossip. The world now knows the answer though only because of a slip of the tongue by Mr Buffett’s 97-year-old right-hand man Charlie Munger at the annual shareholders’ meeting on May 1st. That forced Mr Buffett to confirm that his heir apparent as chief executive is Greg Abel 58 a trusted lieutenant who runs Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses.

The cack-handed way in which the succession plan became public fits a bigger pattern. Berkshire is a huge public company with a stockmarket value of $645bn and an army of devoted retail investors. It is though structured and run in much the way it was when Mr Buffett took it over in the 1960s. He has never hidden his reluctance to retire. He once joked that he’ll step down five years after he dies.

""I don't know if that'll be 10 deals or 50 deals"" Van Tuyl said. ""We'll just see what the opportunities are.""

After the March 2015 sale of Van Tuyl Group of Phoenix then the largest privately held dealership group in the U.S. to Berkshire Hathaway Van Tuyl said he spent five years as chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Automotive.

He told Automotive News that he had agreed to stay on as chairman for that time period. And once a noncompete agreement with Berkshire ended Van Tuyl said he bought a BMW store late last year in Glendale Ariz. He said he also owns a Volvo store which he acquired from Berkshire Hathaway Automotive and a new Jaguar-Land Rover dealership also in Glendale.

Van Tuyl said he just didn't want to stay out of automotive retailing.

""We just wanted to get back into it because we love the business and all the people associated with it"" he said. ""And so we're excited.""

He called Berkshire Hathaway ""fantastic"" and said it would ""continue to be fantastic.""

Van Tuyl's most recent acquisition came when he bought Team Gillman Honda West last week from Chris Gillman. The store has been renamed Easy Honda.

Bill Scrivner CEO of Pinnacle Mergers & Acquisitions in Frisco Texas said he represented Van Tuyl in that transaction. And he said he is working with Van Tuyl to help him find more acquisition targets. The two have known each other for nearly three decades Scrivner said and have done ""probably 50 deals"" together.

Scrivner who described Van Tuyl as a friend said he got a call from him this year indicating he wanted to get back into the business and wondered what stores were available.

Scrivner's firm had just represented Penske Automotive Group Inc. in the sale of two Texas Honda dealerships to Gillman in December. His firm reached out to Gillman to ask whether he'd consider selling one of them.

""Larry and Chris Gillman and I got together and had lunch in Houston and talked about a deal and we were able to reach an agreement very quickly that I feel like they're both very happy with"" Scrivner said.

Van Tuyl is close to signing contracts on several other acquisitions Scrivner said.

""He loves to be in Texas and Arizona obviously"" he said. ""He's got a home in Arizona. He has a home in Texas. He likes both states and wants to be able to buy dealerships in both states.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5iaXRjb2luLmNvbS9hcm5vbGQtc2Nod2FyemVuZWdnZXItd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHRzLWNyeXB0by1pbnZlc3RtZW50LXN0cmF0ZWd5LWJpdGNvaW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arnold Schwarzenegger Follows Warren Buffett's Crypto Investment Strategy Keeps Away From Bitcoin – Featured ...,,,,

Buying a second home or vacation home rental can be a huge responsibility. After all just like your own home it will require regular maintenance and tax payments. Plus if you're planning on using the second home yourself it needs to be in a location that's attractive to you as well as the vacation makers who'll rent if from you.

Above all however a vacation home has to be financially viable to ensure you don't lose too much money on it. So – well located and accessible attractive to people going to vacation financially lucrative. Tahoe as it happens has it all.

The best of California and Nevada

Apart from its stunning beauty – it's the second deepest natural lake in the United States – Lake Tahoe has an important unique characteristic: it straddles two states California and Nevada. This puts it at an enormous geographical advantage as a vacation destination and as an attractive opportunity for buyers.

Tahoe is the best alternative to buying in the over-crowded areas of California that already have too many hotels. According to Departures 'to make a vacation home financially worthwhile you have to steer clear of Los Angeles Orange County San Francisco and Napa Valley.' The over-abundance of vacation options there 'decreases the vacation rental value.' This is not the case in Lake Tahoe which is not so built up.

Of course if you do buy on the California side taxes will be high. However given that Lake Tahoe cabins go for over $200 a night in high season you will more than cover your costs.

And if you buy on the Nevada side your property taxes will be significantly lower even if you buy in one of the counties close to California. As Tahoe real estate specialist Linda Granger puts it 'Generally I tell people that if they buy a $1000000 house in CA their tax bill will be about $1000/month while in Douglas County the property tax on a $1000000 house is +/- $3500 per year.' That's a real difference.

An all-season destination

While the summer season is the busiest at Tahoe it is actually an all-season destination with ski resorts in winter and foliage hotspots in the fall. Of course if generating an income is your top priority you will need to rent out the home during the summer months when occupancy and prices are both at their peak.

The good news is that you don't have to buy the more expensive properties by the shore. Amanda Adams of Paradise Real Estate writes that 'a lot of people think that a VHR has to be located on the shores of the Lake. But that just isn’t the case... some of the most popular VHRs are miles away from the Lake.' Some of the most popular destinations on Lake Tahoe have a mountain woodland or meadow setting so you really don't need to worry about buying on the beach.

Should I buy a vacation home?

Ultimately any decision to purchase a second home should rest primarily on you being prepared to reap longer-term benefits. Vacation homes in popular locations appreciate in value over time always even if the profits you'll be making from renting out initially may be small. Ultimately if the vacation home is in a location you find attractive it could be a great backup plan for retirement.

The disadvantages are mainly the high mortgage costs that come with vacation homes high taxes dependent on the state you're buying in and low rental incomes outside the peak vacation season. If you can afford it however a vacation home is an excellent long-term investment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9yZXZpZXcvbWljcm9zb2Z0LXN1cmZhY2UtbGFwdG9wLTQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Surface Laptop 4 (15-Inch AMD) Review: Battery Champion,"Microsoft's Surface Laptop 4 is everything I'd hoped the previous version would be which is to say an excellent all-around well-made machine with a speedy AMD chip. It isn't the most powerful laptop around nor is it the cheapest but it's powerful enough for most people and wraps Windows in a package that competes well with Apple's hardware.

Same Package Better Performance

The Surface Laptop 4 looks like the Surface Laptop 3. Technically it's slightly thinner but unless they're side by side you won't notice. At just over half an inch thick (0.58 inches) and weighing only 3.4 pounds this is a remarkably portable 15-inch machine. For comparison that's half a pound lighter than the lightest configuration of Dell's XPS 15. (It's also available in a smaller 13.5-inch screen size.)

There's a new ""Ice Blue"" color option but most of what was good about the Laptop 3 remains unchanged here. The build quality is still excellent the all-metal construction doesn't flex or bend when carried and while it's not the easiest laptop to open with one hand it's manageable.

The 3:2 screen ratio also remains as does Microsoft's proprietary charging port along with one USB-C one USB-A and a headphone jack. I appreciate the latter two but it's disappointing that neither the Intel nor AMD Surface Laptops support Thunderbolt on the USB-C port.

I mention this mainly because both the Dell XPS 15 and MacBooks support Thunderbolt which means better connections to external monitors and faster data transfer speeds. Depending on your situation the USB-A port on the Surface Laptop 4 might be more of a win than the lack of Thunderbolt. At least the USB-C port can be used to charge the thing helpful if you carry an external battery capable of charging laptops.

What's different in this update is that you can now get both the 13-inch and 15-inch models with either Intel or AMD chips (this was previously only a luxury for the 15-incher). If you opt for Intel you'll get 11th-generation Core i5 or i7 chips. If you prefer AMD you'll get Ryzen 4000 series processors. If you're not sure which is best for your use case check out our laptop buying guide.

While chip updates are pretty standard for a new laptop release Microsoft claims these changes along with some other tweaks deliver not only better performance but also improved battery life compared to the previous Surface Laptop. I have to agree. Performance-wise the Laptop 4 is a huge step up. It runs circles around the Laptop 3 in every CineBench benchmark I ran. More impressive the new version doesn't get nearly as hot even when I was pushing it with benchmark tests.

I tested the 15-inch AMD Ryzen 7 4000 series configuration with 16 gigabytes of RAM and a 512-gigabyte SSD. As configured this model is $1700. That's roughly comparable to Dell's 15-inch XPS or the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The Ryzen 7 Surface fared well against the i9 Dell in benchmarks though of course the latter was faster (much faster in some cases). I have never tested the 16-inch MacBook but the Surface Laptop 4's results beat many of the MacBook benchmarks available online. It's worth noting though that if you're in the market for a larger laptop Apple is expected to release an M1-based MacBook Pro later this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvcnF1ZW5ld3MuY29tLzEwODQvNC1tb3N0LWV4cGVuc2l2ZS1vbGRlci1zdWJhcnUtbW9kZWxzLW1haW50YWluLWFuZC02LWJlc3QtYnV50gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG9ycXVlbmV3cy5jb20vMTA4NC80LW1vc3QtZXhwZW5zaXZlLW9sZGVyLXN1YmFydS1tb2RlbHMtbWFpbnRhaW4tYW5kLTYtYmVzdC1idXkvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 4 Most Expensive Older Subaru Models To Maintain And The 6 Best To Buy,"Follow us today...

With the cost of used cars skyrocketing you want to make sure you buy a used vehicle that is reliable. Consumer Reports ranked the least and most expensive ten-year-old cars and SUVs to keep on the road. What Subaru models make the list? The study comes from owners who reveal how much they spend on repairs.

Consumer Reports says three Subaru models that make the new list. CR checked ten-year-old models (2011 model year vehicles) to find the least and most expensive cars and SUVs to keep on the road. The study shows Subaru has three 2011 model year vehicles to check out thoroughly before you buy. The 2011 Subaru Forester compact SUV 2011 Subaru Outback midsize SUV/crossover and 2011 Subaru Legacy sedan.

The 10 most expensive ten-year-old cars to maintain and repair

The most expensive ten-year-old cars under $10000 to maintain and repair per year are the BMW 5 Series ($1200) BMW 3 Series ($800) Audi A4 ($550) and the Subaru Legacy ($500).

The most expensive ten-year-old SUVs under $10000 to maintain and repair are the Acura RDX ($700) Chevrolet Traverse ($590) Cadillac SRX ($530) Buick Enclave ($505) Subaru Forester ($500) and Subaru Outback ($500).

The 2013 Subaru Outback

According to another report from online automotive resource CarComplaints the 2013 Subaru Outback is a year you should also be aware of before you buy. CarComplaints listed 337 complaints about the 2013 Outback with twenty-four complaints being about the engine. Torque News reported in 2014 Subaru was sued over excessive oil consumption and the 2013 Subaru Outback was on the list.

What are the best used Subaru model years?

For the first time the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and Consumer Reports collaborate to recommend the best used vehicles you can buy under $20000. CR and IIHS say the best used Subaru models are the Subaru Forester (2016 or newer) Subaru Outback (2014 or newer) Subaru Crosstrek (2018 or newer) Subaru Impreza (2014 or newer) and Subaru Legacy (2013 or newer).

If you cannot buy a new model now which is the best year if you shop for a three-year-old SUV? Consumer Reports ranked the most reliable three-year-old midsize SUVs and the 2018 Subaru Outback scores one of the eight best used SUV choices.

Consumers looking for the best used cars under $10000 have lots of choices. The 2011 Forester Outback and Legacy make the most expensive to maintain and repair list. Some older Subaru Forester Outback Crosstrek Impreza and Legacy models make the first-ever combined Consumer Reports and IIHS best vehicles to buy recommendations list.

Interested in ETFs? Visit our ETF Hub for investor news and education market updates and analysis and easy-to-use tools to help you select the right ETFs.

BlackRock has hit back at suggestions from the Bank for International Settlements that bond exchange traded funds might have short-changed market makers during the March 2020 market sell-off.

The BIS paper suggested that large price dislocations opened up last year between bond ETFs and the prices of their underlying securities because ETF managers deliberately handed authorised participants baskets of low-quality bonds. This would have discouraged underlying trading and jammed the arbitrage mechanism designed to bring the share price of an ETF back into line with its net asset value.

But in a report released on Monday the world’s largest asset manager says the data it has compiled prove it did not do this and that these so-called redemption baskets contained a mix of securities that fairly reflected the underlying holdings of each ETF.

APs and market makers are the engines for ETFs not only providing liquidity but also performing an intermediary role — accepting baskets of securities from the ETF provider and returning them to the provider on a daily basis trading in the ETF’s underlying securities and controlling the amount of ETF shares in existence by creating and redeeming them. This process is supposed to keep ETF prices close to the underlying net asset value of the securities they own but in March last year there was a huge price dislocation.

BlackRock’s analysis shows that between February 19 and March 12 the worst day of the crisis 95 per cent of the 1000-plus securities held by the $21.8bn iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) appeared in the redemption baskets received by APs at some point.

Likewise 67 per cent of the 2000 or so credits held by the $41.6bn iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) appeared in the baskets. The figures for a suite of five European-domiciled fixed-income ETFs ranged from 80-89 per cent except for one corporate bond fund that actually saw net inflows during the crisis period.

BlackRock argued that these figures show the baskets were highly diversified during the sell-off leaving little wriggle room for it to have stuffed the redemption baskets with disproportionately lower quality securities even if had been inclined to do so.

Unlike those for equity-based ETFs redemption baskets for bond ETFs typically do not contain every security as the relatively high minimum trading size of bonds means it can be impractical to hand an AP a tiny sliver of potentially hundreds or even thousands of credits.

There has been scrutiny of how bond ETFs traded during the Covid-driven market sell-off in March-April 2020. Large parts of the $1.2tn fixed-income ETF universe plunged to unprecedented discounts to net asset value with Vanguard’s $55bn Total Bond Market ETF (BND) and BlackRock’s $71bn iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) closing at discounts of 6.2 per cent and 4.4 per cent respectively on March 12.

An array of other junk bond municipal debt bank loan and US government bond ETFs also traded at extraordinary discounts even though ETFs are purposely designed to closely track the value of their underlying holdings.

Further data from BlackRock on the average duration bid-offer spread and liquidity of the contents of the redemption basket vis-à-vis the ETFs themselves show relatively little difference between the two although in some cases the spreads were a fraction wider for the basket securities.

“The [BIS] paper suggested some issuers would try to deliver more concentrated baskets. It was actually the opposite” said Samara Cohen co-head of iShares markets and investments of a period she described as “the mother of all stressed bond markets”.

“In a volatile market with a lot of difficulty around price transparency the best way to make sure we did deliver out a representative basket was to widen the basket” said Cohen. “A more diversified basket was also what the market maker community wanted. It relieved them from having to sell any concentrated positions.”

Moreover the higher the level of redemptions the more necessary it is to broaden redemption baskets in order to avoid an ETF becoming increasingly skewed relative to its underlying index she added.

The BIS analysis covered a longer time period than the BlackRock study without an artificial March 12 cut-off. It also scrutinised a broader range of subsectors including Treasury bond funds and a wider range of ETF providers.

In contrast to the BIS study Cohen said it was the discounted price of many bond ETFs that was truly reflective of the market’s perceptions of fair value during the crisis not the prices of the underlying bonds used to calculate the fund’s NAV.

BlackRock said for example that on March 12 last year at the height of the market storm LQD traded almost 90000 times compared with an average of just 37 times each for the ETF’s five largest holdings.

Throughout March more than half of LQD’s holdings traded between zero and five times a day on average it added.

The combined company is valued at $2.2 billion and will have $700 million in cash on hand when the deal closes in the second half of 2021.



The Gores Metropoulos II Inc. transaction will include a private placement of $200 million from investors Fidelity Management & Research Co. as well as funds and accounts managed by BlackRock Inc. and Senator Investment Group.



The SPAC raised about raised $450 million through an initial public offering in January.



San Francisco-based Sonder which offers refurbished properties for short-term rentals works with real estate developers who build properties Sonder operates under its name.



“With its enormous market opportunity and experienced leadership team Sonder has already proven the resiliency and scalability of its business and has tremendous potential to continue expanding globally amid tailwinds created by the impending travel recovery” Gores said in a statement.



Gores chairman and chief executive of The Gores Group did his first SPAC in 2015. He has created 13 SPACs to date — more than anyone else on Wall Street — and closed eight of the 13 deals with transaction values totaling more than $38 billion.

His Beverly Hills-based private equity firm raised a combined $1.1 billion on three SPACs in March alone.



Gores also closed the largest SPAC transaction to date with a combination of Pontiac Mich.-based United Wholesale Mortgage and Gores Holdings IV Inc. The January merger had a valuation of about $16 billion.



Sonder expects to achieve about $4 billion of revenue by 2025 and believes its technology-driven service model can reduce operating costs by half compared with traditional hotels.



Chief Executive and co-founder Francis Davidson came up with the idea for Sonder while managing apartments for short-term stays as a university student in Montreal.

Sonder which has collected more than $560 million in investor funding since it launched in 2014 partners with companies including Airbnb Inc. Booking.com and Expedia Group Inc. to reach customers.



The company has 4500-plus listings in 30 cities in eight countries. Sonder estimates that it attracts more than 1 million guests annually for its 300-plus properties.



SPACs are essentially a corporate shell through which investor money is raised via a public offering.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

This press release and the schedules hereto include Adjusted EBITDA for the RDS segment which is a financial measure that has not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or GAAP and is therefore referred to as a non-GAAP financial measure. We have provided a definition below for this non-GAAP financial measure and have provided tables in the schedules hereto to reconcile this non-GAAP financial measure to the comparable GAAP financial measure.

This press release also includes a forward-looking full year Adjusted EBITDA outlook. A reconciliation for the forward-looking full-year 2021 Adjusted EBITDA outlook is not being provided as we do not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such reconciliation. Our management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort the impact these variables and individual adjustments will have on its reported net income and its reported effective tax rate because these items which could be significant are difficult to predict and may be highly variable.

We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure provides valuable information regarding our earnings and business trends by excluding specific items that we believe are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of our businesses providing a useful way for investors to make a comparison of our performance over time and against other companies in our industry.

We have provided this non-GAAP financial measure as supplemental information to our GAAP financial measures and believe this non-GAAP measure provides investors with additional meaningful financial information regarding our operating performance and cash flows. Our management and board of directors also use this non-GAAP measure as a supplemental measure to evaluate our businesses and the performance of management including the determination of performance-based compensation to make operating and strategic decisions and to allocate financial resources. We believe this non-GAAP measure also provides meaningful information for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. Furthermore the non-GAAP measure presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

The General Presidency for the Affairs of the Saudi Grand Mosque and the Prophet’s Mosque released photos of the al-Hajar al-Aswad or the Black Stone as part of a series showing a number of holy artifacts that play a role in the hajj.

The General Presidency which oversees the holy sites in Mecca said 1050 high-resolution photographs were taken in a seven-hour session. The images are up to 49000 megapixels in size and took more than 50 hours to photograph and develop the religious agency said.

The stone which Islamic tradition holds fell at the time of Adam and Eve is framed in pure silver at the southeast corner of the Kaaba itself said to have been constructed by Abraham and his son Ishmael.

During the hajj which Muslims are instructed to complete at least once in their lifetime pilgrims perform Tawaf or circumambulation seven times counter-clockwise around the Kaaba.

Astonishing images of the al-Hajar al-Aswad said to date back to the time of Adam and Eve were unveiled by the General Presidency for the Affairs of the Saudi Grand Mosque on Monday.

They took more than 50 hours to capture and develop with the General Presidency working with the Two Holy Mosques' agency to take some 1050 photographs in a seven-hour session.

Astonishing images of the al-Hajar al-Aswad (above) were unveiled by the General Presidency for the Affairs of the Saudi Grand Mosque on Monday

The revered Islamic relic thought to be a meteorite is set in the eastern corner of the Kabba at the centre of the Grand Mosque in Mecca.

Stone said to date back to Adam and Eve may have fallen from space The Black Stone has often be described as a meteorite and Islamic tradition holds that it fell from heaven as a guide for Adam and Eve to build an altar which became the first temple. It is widely believed that it was originally pure white but has since changed colour because of the sins of the people who touch it. The Islamic relic has long been associated with the Kaaba. According to tradition it was set intact into the Kaaba’s wall by the prophet Muhammad in 605 CE. It plays a central role in the ritual of istilam where pilgrims kiss the Black Stone or touch it with their hands. Advertisement

According to tradition the stone was set into the building's wall by the Islamic prophet Mohammed in 605 CE.

The Black Stone has since been broken into fragments which are cemented into a silver frame in the side of the Kabba.

New images of the ancient stone were taken using a technique called focus stacking which combines several images with different focus points according to CNN.

The relic appears a reddish brown colour despite its name with scattered grey.

Afifi al-Akiti a fellow in Islamic studies at the University of Oxford said the photographs are significant because 'in a sense this is unprecedented.'

He added: 'One sees that it's not actually black for example... As I understand it it's the first time there is a magnified digital photo of the stone and one can see the stone up close and personal.

'In the Muslim tradition this is considered to be a holy relic but reason plays a major role in the Muslim tradition.

'So while it is unprecedented to see a picture of the stone I think Muslims are down to Earth and science plays a major role in the religion'.

Mohammed is said to have received his first revelations in Mecca in the early 7th century not long after it is claimed he placed the Black Stone in the Kabba."

Much has changed since he went to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University but the Boeing employee still pursues civil rights and breakthroughs in chemistry. And he's been honored for his ongoing efforts in both areas.

Johnson 80 of Columbus works as the chemical technology lead at the Boeing Guidance Repair Center in Heath where he’s worked for 25 years. He previously worked in films research and development at Dow Chemical Company in Granville where he invented a special blend of polymers for labels on plastic bottles.

2021 Black Engineer of the Year Modern Day Technology Leader Award

U.S. Black Engineer and Information Technology a publication devoted to engineering science and technology and promoting opportunities in those fields selected Johnson for its 2021 Black Engineer of the Year Modern Day Technology Leader Award.

“My nomination for an award caused a reaction of disbelief” Johnson said. “The award was an acknowledgement by my peers of the value of my hard work and my contributions in the workplace.”

As a materials and process engineer Johnson tests chemical compounds materials and processes used in the navigation systems of intercontinental ballistic missiles nuclear-capable submarines and aircraft to determine their safety and suitability in extreme conditions.

He also conducts the monthly safety inspections that helped keep the Boeing labs injury-free for five years. In 2016 he improved the site’s safety and technology capabilities by helping secure funds for new technology in the labs that saved time and money.

Boeing spokesman Josh Roth said ""He’s in a leadership role. He’s doing great. He hasn’t missed a step. It’s incredible.”

'I’m still working to ensure young people have opportunity'

In 2006 Johnson was recognized by the International Civil Rights Center and Museum for his participation in the 1960 Greensboro North Carolina sit-in.

Johnson said his family’s history helped give him the courage to join the protest which led to his arrest.

“My grandmother’s experience as the daughter of a slave and having to drop out of school after the third grade to work in the fields was one impetus” Johnson said. “Also the teachings of my Sunday school instilled a strong sense of self-worth in me.”

Asked how he would assess the country’s progress on civil rights Johnson said his focus is on today’s youth.

“I’m still working to ensure young people have opportunity” Johnson said. “It’s a challenge but one thing I’ve committed myself to is giving back because so many people gave back to me.”

Johnson has continued working to improve access and equity for others. He once served on a city council as a racial equality liaison and today engages with the Boeing Black Employees Association and Boeing Generation to Generation Business Resource Groups.

'I was learning in an environment that demanded I be engaged'

In a story written by Rosemary Lane and Josh Roth in Boeing News Now Johnson explains how his interests in chemistry and civil rights became intertwined when he was in college.

Following is an excerpt from their story:

“I realized I was learning in an environment that demanded I be engaged” Johnson said. “I was constantly trying to make things better because as one student put it ‘Oscar you get a degree but where are you going to work?’ I wanted to make a better world for African Americans to live in by removing barriers.”

Johnson carried his chemistry books with him to sit-ins at the Woolworths’ lunch counter joining in the historic Greensboro sit-in to desegregate the five-and-dime store — a peaceful protest that catalyzed sit-ins across the country.

After being arrested during protests and later in sit-ins at segregated theaters Johnson learned his chemistry books offered a good distraction from the jail’s rough floors and helped him keep up on his studies.

'I would like to see more young people pursue a career in STEM'

Johnson said his interest in chemistry dates back to helping his grandmother do household chores.

“Growing up in Greensboro North Carolina my grandmother taught me how to mix and heat cooking grease to create lye soap” Johnson said. “Watching the chemical process unfold sparked my lifelong interest in chemistry and chemical engineering.”

He hopes to instill that same interest in young people today especially in science technology engineering and math.

""I would like to see more young people pursue a career in STEM"" Johnson said. ""That’s the reason I participate in STEM outreach programs at Boeing. I try to be a window to what could be available to students if they choose to be in STEM — to ensure young people have opportunity.""

Specifically we flew American Airlines from Tampa to Dallas to Maui with the second segment being operated by a Boeing 777-200.

In this post I wanted to review the experience on that 7hr40min flight both to a give a sense of what service is like on American in the coronavirus era and also to review American’s 777-200 business class as I’ve never written about it before. On the return flight I flew United’s 787-9 business class from Maui to Chicago and you can read that review here.

How I booked American Airlines business class

For our four tickets I redeemed miles for three and paid cash for one:

Business class awards from Tampa to Dallas to Maui were available for 45000 American AAdvantage miles one-way each which is quite a good deal

I booked a paid business class ticket for ~$900 one-way for myself which is quite a good price and that will earn me lots of elite qualifying and redeemable miles

American 777-200 business class layout & seating

American has two types of business class seats on Boeing 777-200s. Some planes still have Zodiac business class seats while others have Collins Aerospace Super Diamond seats.

Our flight from Dallas to Maui was operated by a 777-200 with Collins Aerospace Super Diamond seats which I’d consider to be the better of the two business class seats. Ultimately this is a pretty generic product which is to say that lots of airlines have these seats. However I have to say that I find American’s version to be among the sleeker ones out there.

American has 37 business class seats on the 777-200 — there’s a forward cabin with 21 seats and then a rear cabin with 16 seats. The two cabins are separated by the second set of doors where there’s also usually a walk-up bar on long haul flights though nothing is being offered there at the moment.

I assigned us the four seats in the last row.

I was in seat 10L the seat in the last row of the cabin on the right side.

I really do like the Collins Aerospace Super Diamond seats — they’re functional and they have plenty of storage with two compartments along the side of the seat.

American Airlines business class seat storage

The power outlets and entertainment controller are located inside one of the compartments.



American Airlines business class power outlets & entertainment controller

Then the seat can be controlled from a monitor next to these compartments.



American Airlines business class seat controls

The personal entertainment screen is in a fixed position in front of the seat and underneath that is the tray table. This can be pulled out or pushed in and when you pull it out far enough you can double the size of it.

The one downside to these seats is that the footwell is on the fairly small side so when you recline your seat all the way it might feel a bit tight (but not problematically so in my opinion at least compared to some other seats).



American Airlines business class seat footwell

I appreciate how American has individual air nozzles on Boeing 777s since not all airlines do. That really helps to avoid feeling too warm.

For what it’s worth below is a picture of the premium economy cabin on the 777-200 which is similar to American’s domestic first class.

And since most of us are flying a lot less right now than in the past here are some wing views from departing Dallas and arriving in Maui — ah I love flying!

American business class food & drinks

Waiting at each seat upon boarding was a printed menu — the front side had the food selection while the back side had the drink selection. Keep in mind that American still has scaled back service and for that matter service may never return to how it was pre-coronavirus.

The menu & drink list read as follows:

While there were no pre-departure drinks each passenger was handed a bottle of water during boarding.

Bottled water in American Airlines business class

About 30 minutes after takeoff carts were rolled down the aisle with drinks and packaged mixed nuts. I ordered some still water and a Diet Coke — all drinks were served in plastic cups.

American Airlines business class drink service

Shortly thereafter the meal service began — meals were all served on a single tray with everything covered with an appetizer main course dessert and bread roll. Fortunately American Airlines lets you pre-order your main course so you can be assured that you receive your first choice.

The meal consisted of:

A sundried tomato tartar with white balsamic vinaigrette farro salad and microgreens

For the main course I selected the steamed sea bass with cilantro rice and ginger soy glaze

A raspberry cheesecake tart for dessert



American Airlines business class meal service

I am so so embarrassed by my horrible trip reporting here as this clearly shows you how rusty I’ve gotten. I took a picture of the meal with all the packaging (to show how it’s presented) then meticulously removed all the packaging to get a picture of the meal without it and then somehow forgot to take said picture.

I didn’t realize this happened until I later went to retrieve the pictures only to find I didn’t capture one. If you can find the kindness in your heart to forgive me please do. Ugh.

Anyway the meal itself was fine. The sundried tomato tart had a bit of an odd flavor the sea bass was decent but not really restaurant-quality the bread roll could have doubled as a weapon based on how hard it was and the cheesecake tasted exactly like those Philadelphia Cream Cheese cheesecake tarts I would sometimes have a couple of decades ago.

After the meal I had a cup of coffee.



American Airlines business class drink service

A little over two hours before landing a pre-arrival snack was served. This consisted of two options — a fruit and cheese plate or a protein bowl. The fruit and cheese plate had cheese and grapes while the protein bowl had a slice of turkey half of a hardboiled egg dried apricots a slice of apple and some grapes.

Both snacks were served with packaged sea salt flatbread and some packaged chocolate.

All things considered the food was decent enough especially given the times. While the main meal was a good size I will say that I wish the pre-landing snack would have been a bit bigger given that this flight is longer than a London to New York flight.

American business class bedding

While perhaps not as good as United’s Polaris bedding American’s Casper bedding is solid. Each business class passenger was offered a blanket and pillow which made it easy to get comfortable.

American Airlines business class bedding

There were no amenity kits offered on this flight for what it’s worth.

American 777-200 entertainment & Wi-Fi

American Airlines has a partnership with Bang & Olufsen and each passenger was offered headphones. While these are objectively pretty good headphones personally I far prefer the Bose headphones that American used to offer — I don’t find that these have very good noise cancelation. Am I the only one who feels that way?

American Airlines has an excellent entertainment selection on 777s though the only thing I watched was the moving map since I took the opportunity to work for most of the flight.

Speaking of getting work done American’s 777s have Panasonic Wi-Fi though pricing sure has increased over time. A full flight pass cost $35 while in the past the most expensive pass was somewhere around $20 if I recall correctly. On the plus side at least speeds were decent (for long haul Wi-Fi) and there were no data caps.

American business class service

The crew on this flight was lovely. The flight attendants serving my aisle were informal and genuinely friendly and caring. They quickly responded to all requests and were even proactive about further service whether it was another cup of coffee or a water refill.

While the crew was fairly senior I was surprised they weren’t more senior frankly. Dallas is a senior flight attendant base and I figured with international flying opportunities being fairly limited that it wouldn’t get much more senior than a Maui trip like this.

Bottom line

We had an excellent flight on American Airlines from Dallas to Maui. While service has been scaled back significantly it’s a treat to fly reverse herringbone seats domestically the bedding was excellent I was able to get work done the crew was friendly and the food was edible.

It’s definitely a sign of the times that this is the first time in 16 months that I flew in a reverse herringbone seat.

If you’ve flown American’s 777-200 business class what was your experience like?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3VuaXRlZC03NjctY3Jldy1yZXN0LXNlYXRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to snag the 4 best coach seats in United Airlines’ fleet,"Your coach seat just got upgraded — but not to business class or premium economy.

Instead if you're flying on a United Airlines Boeing 767 on a domestic or short-haul international flight you can sit in the crew rest that's usually reserved for flight attendants on the carrier's longest flights — but you'll have to monitor the seat map to see when they open up.

Want more airline-specific news? Sign up for TPG's free new biweekly Aviation newsletter!

While some jets feature crew bunks above or below the passenger compartments United's 767s — both the -300 and -400 variants — are outfitted with four extra-reclining coach seats for flight attendants. There's a thick curtain that can be closed to cordon off the seats from the rest of the cabin when the crew rest is in use.

While flight attendants use these seats during downtime on long-haul flights domestic hops and shorter international jaunts don't include breaks for the crew.

That's when they're available to passengers — and they're a major upgrade compared to a typical coach-class seat.

The four seats are located in the last two rows of the cabin on the port side of the jet. They feature a leg rest footrest a ton of extra legroom and generous recline.

They also sport an oversized tray table that pops out from the fixed armrest making it easier to work during the flight.

You'll find the standard coach amenities like personal TVs and power outlets at these seats as well.

Of course some flyers might prefer to be closer to the front of the plane far away from the galley but I'd personally sacrifice seat location in exchange for added space and comfort.

United generally blocks these seats in the weeks and months leading up to a flight as you'll see in the ExpertFlyer screenshot below with the blue boxes and white X's in Row 43 and Row 44 Seats A and B.

(Screenshot courtesy of ExpertFlyer)

Then within a day or two or departure they're released for assignment. United labels them as extra-legroom Economy Plus seats so they come at an upcharge for regular flyers. Premier elites can choose these seats for free depending on their status tier.

(Screenshot courtesy of United)

For an upcoming flight between New York-JFK and Los Angeles United was charging $72 to upgrade. That's the exact same cost as the other standard extra-legroom seats except those don't feature a leg rest footrest or nearly as much additional space.

Premier Platinum and 1K members can choose extra-legroom seats — including the crew-rest versions —for free for themselves and up to eight companions any time after booking subject to availability. Mid-tier Gold flyers can bring one companion for free and can reserve them any time after booking as well. Silver members also get one free companion but they can only snag the extra-legroom seats beginning at the 24-hour check-in window.

New renderings have been released of the 320-metre skyscraper showing the development eclipsing the nearby Chrysler Building.

Designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox (KPF) and developed by Boston Properties the building will contain 69548 square metres of office space as well as retail and a connection to the future East Side Access project and Grand Central Terminal.

The building is roughly divided into thirds separated by small step-backs and large bronze-coloured multi-storey trusses.

Each of these has outdoor terraces and seating while the building’s crown contains space for greenery and trees.

Above : The 320-metre supertall is expected to be completed by 2026. Image courtesy of KPF.



Demolition work is already underway on the site with excavation for the tower due to commence in 2022. Construction is expected to be wholly completed by 2026.

Midtown Manhattan underwent a dramatic rezoning in 2017 paving the way for a series of supertall skyscraper developments.

The first and most high profile of which was the recently completed 67-floor 427-metre One Vanderbilt.

While the New York City construction industry is still recovering from COVID-19 the demand for commercial office space has continued unabated allowing for even more proposals of supertall commercial buildings.

Other major proposals include two projects from Foster + Partners: the 426-metre 270 Park Avenue and the 365-metre Penn 15.



270 Park Avenue will stand as the third tallest building in New York by roof height while its dramatic tapering form will have a profound impact on the city’s skyline.

A 500-metre 85-storey mixed-use tower has also been proposed by Skidmore Owings & Merrill (SOM).

175 Park Avenue - otherwise known as Project Commodore - will be a state-of-the-art sustainable tower providing extensive improvements to the surrounding transportation infrastructure while also creating new public spaces.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Case Competition – Minority Key Bank Case Competition 2nd Place Winner

Which academic or extracurricular achievement are you most proud of during business school? One of my foremost goals coming into business school was to become president of my class. I knew should I get the position that I would bring an innovative perspective spawned from the unique circumstance of being both Black and queer to bring about positive change – not only my current classmates but also future Katz students well.

Working tirelessly over the next year as a member of the Student Executive Board I cultivated the skills and relationships necessary to achieve my goal. Upon hearing I got elected I immediately realized that I had the opportunity to become the first president responsible for providing innovative meaningful events in a completely online environment. Through diligent inspired work my team was able to accomplish a tremendous amount this year. One event that was particularly successful was the first Katz Walk-a-Thon. Through discussions with both first- and second-year students we found that several of them noticed a distinct lack of physical activity throughout the semester especially around finals. Particularly since COVID-19 had increased our screen time and perpetuated increasingly sedentary lifestyles I knew that this event would be readily embraced by the student body. We had over ten teams join which surprisingly included several members of the faculty. As a group we walked a total of 9329610 steps. After the event we received several glowing testimonials from both the faculty and students about how much they loved the competition and felt inspired to walk for hours each day.

What achievement are you most proud of in your professional career? Entering the MBA program as someone whose primary experience was within the operations and customer service industry my goal of moving into the information technology industry was daunting to say the least. It was nothing short of serendipitous that I became a part of the operational excellence team at Bristol Myers Squibb.

Admittedly I was anxious to be starting the internship within a powerhouse company in an industry I am unfamiliar with as many of my cohorts had trained their entire undergraduate and graduate lives to be in the field. However throughout the internship they provided me first-hand knowledge of the tremendous impact that information technology could have on a company and actually gave me the chance to make a meaningful impact. One of the projects I worked on that I was particularly proud of was helping recreate one of the sites off the main sites’ IT page. My work and research were pivotal in helping the organization align its strategy with its goals thus providing a strong base for continued development. This internship blessed me with knowledge from some of the top minds in the IT world and gave me an intrinsic sense of pride in knowing that I was able to leave an indisputably positive impact.

Why did you choose this business school? Anytime someone asks me why I chose Katz I must start with my career management counselor Dana Romano. From the first interaction at our interview to our weekly meetings about planning school events she has always made me feel like family. The “secret sauce” to Katz is how family-oriented the school is while providing an enriching experienced-based learning program. When I interviewed with Dana she took the time to get to know me and made sure I understood what Katz would be able to provide for me. I was invited to participate in Admitted Students Weekend and by the time I left campus I had made up my mind to commit to Katz. Meeting all the outstanding faculty staff professors and students (particularly one of my closest classmates Dan King) made what should have been a challenging decision simple. At the end of the day the biggest reason I decided to attend this wonderful program is that both Dana and Katz faculty/students made me feel wanted. Katz was the only school out of all my offers to make me truly feel this way and has continued to do so throughout my time here. There is no more incredible feeling when you are pursuing higher education and life goals to meet a group of people who want nothing but the best for you and will actively work to facilitate the achievement of your goals.

What was your favorite MBA event or tradition at your business school? Without a shred of doubt in my mind I can confidently say that the best tradition at Katz is Friendsgiving. Being a part of the Student Executive Board we pioneered this event with the express purpose of learning about each other’s culture. Katz is a melting pot where we have students who come from places such as Mongolia India Pakistan and Japan. This event was designed so that we could foster collaboration between all students and give everyone a chance to share their culture with their colleagues. This event served to expose people to foods and traditions from a wide variety of cultures and gave those international students who had traveled so far to be with us a little taste of home. In addition the international students get a little taste of home and have a platform to share their cultures and delicacies which demonstrates that Katz truly is a community.

Looking back over your MBA experience what is the one thing you’d do differently and why? Looking back on my MBA experience I wish I had explored the city of Pittsburgh and the surrounding area more. I think it is essential to get to know the city you are living in. However due to the arduous workload accompanying a new student in graduate school I did not have the opportunity to explore the city my first semester. Obviously the opportunity became harder once COVID-19 shut everything down. Pittsburgh is filled with many rich cultures and I encourage all future Katz students to dedicate time to explore this city with a storied past and bright future.

What is the biggest myth about your school? My school’s biggest myth is that we have a small network and constrained learning experience because our school is small. However what I found was that the smaller cohort facilitated the creation of indelible bonds with not only my classmates but faculty and professors as well. At Katz you are not just a number

I am resolute in the belief that these strong intimate relationships are going to serve me well throughout the rest of my time at Katz and beyond. Through the smaller class sizes Katz has developed a strong and widespread network of alumni who are actively seeking to give students the tools and opportunities necessary for success. Simply put the alumni love giving back and anyone would be lucky to have the chance to work with them.

What surprised you the most about business school? The biggest surprise about business school for me was undoubtedly how critical your cohort is to your experience. As with nearly all my colleagues I entered Katz not knowing what to expect of my new classmates. In the end though they turned out to be some of the most memorable and talented individuals I have had the privilege of knowing. Before business school I heard that an MBA program could be very competitive. I found that true at Katz in the best way. Katz fosters and environment that is both competitive but emphasizes teamwork over individualism. The Mariana Trench itself is not deep enough to hold the sheer amount of knowledge wisdom and kindness that I found within this truly spectacular student body. To say that my MBA experience was elevated because of my colleagues would be a gross understatement as they have made these two years the greatest of my life. The fact is I came into this program with 66 strangers but will be leaving with 66 family members.

What is one thing you did during the application process that gave you an edge at the school you chose? I am a fighter. I fought hard throughout my life to develop the skills and experience necessary to achieve this dream and that was made clear to all those who interviewed me. They saw immediately that I had the courage and mettle to confront all trials and tribulations that accompany an MBA program. While my passion and experience got me in the door my drive and willingness to take on all challenges proved that I belonged.

Which MBA classmate do you most admire? The person I admire most in my program though I do admire all of my colleagues is my dear friend John Sopko. John is the epitome of a selfless individual with the kindest of hearts. I came to realize the quality of John’s character during our first semester. John and I were in the same financial management course where I struggled to comprehend the difficult concepts and felt as if I was not capable of successfully getting through the class. John volunteered his time and wisdom to me with no expectation of receiving anything in return. Through his kindness and wisdom I was able to persevere and find an interest in finance and even take the next level of financial management. Anytime I did not understand the material John would go out of his way to ensure that I could comprehend the concepts and truly grasp the material.

Another reason I admire John came during our second semester. John took a fantastic co-op opportunity with IBM. While working hard at IBM John still made it a priority to help Katz students from afar. Whether it was guidance on finance homework or a quick chat about life you could always depend on John to impart advice with patience understanding and wisdom. After his work at IBM he returned in the fall and took 21 credits and did it again the following semester to ensure that he would be able to graduate with the colleagues he had grown so close to. John’s dedication to the students earned him the position of Vice President of the Student Executive Board and he has been instrumental in our quest to provide the students at Katz the best experience possible. Without John’s hard work Katz would not be where it would be today and I will always admire him for that.

How disruptive was it to shift to an online or hybrid environment after COVID hit? To be honest when I first learned that we would not be returning to in-person classes I felt defeated. A foray into a solely online academic environment represented a tremendous deviation from the conventional educational models that nearly all students had become accustomed to working. As such many were fearful as to whether or not such classes would provide a setting conducive to learning. However thanks to the career management team staff and faculty the transition went off without a hitch. The professors were able to move their courses into the online sphere without compromising upon quality. It is truly a testament to the Katz faculty that the professors were able to embrace such a radical shift in course structure whilst simultaneously providing an experience that did not hinder any student’s educational journey. A great example of this came during my SAP certification course with Professor James Kimpel or we know him as “Prof K.” Having taught for decades the move away from in-person classes was likely as fraught with ambiguity and anxiety for him as it was for us. However Prof K adapted brilliantly and as a direct result of his teachings I am proud to say that I passed the certification with a global passing rate of just 65%. This would not have been possible without Prof K’s continuous hard work and dedication to providing students the tools and techniques necessary for success regardless of the medium.

Who most influenced your decision to pursue business in college? My grandfather Ozzie B Payton influenced my decision to pursue my MBA. If you ask any family friend what my grandfather’s hobby was the answer is his grandkids. His dedication to my brothers and my success is something I will always cherish. He was always instilling pivotal lessons and one was higher education. (Shout out to my younger brother for graduating Harvard Law School!) He understood the importance of higher education as he received his master’s from the University of Illinois and his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan. He also was an educator his entire life as both a teacher and principal.

My grandfather worked his hardest to provide for our family and he worked his whole life to be able to provide generational wealth to his family. My grandfather was instrumental in paving the way for me to get to where I am today. I learned from my grandfather that I could do whatever I put my mind to so long as I approached it with passion and a willingness to work hard. My grandfather would always joke that I would eventually be managing his funds one day and he was right. Even though he is no longer with us I will be managing his funds and building upon his work setting up wealth for our family’s future generations.

What are the top two items on your professional bucket list?

Become CEO of my own company and be a board member of a Fortune 100 company. Convince my company to give back to an organization that means the world to me. My mentor Ms. Renee Fluker created a Midnight Golf Program giving Detroit youth a place to learn about the game of golf etiquette and life skills. I was a part of this high school program and it made a meaningful impact on my life. I gained many life skills from this program and even got my own set of golf clubs (I still own to this day). I would love to get my company to sponsor this organization in a meaningful way.

CNN —

This is my first Mother’s Day without my 2-year-old son Blake. It’s been 25 days since he died in my arms after battling brain cancer for nearly a year and a half. I’ve received supportive messages from family friends and strangers reminding me that I will always be Blake’s mom. But every day — and especially today — I mourn the daily joys of being Blake’s mom that pediatric brain cancer stole.

I mourn not being able to give Blake a bath hold him or hear his angelic voice. What’s worse is the fact that so many mothers across the country experience this agony; each year about 2000 children die from cancer in the US. Today I’m sending out a call to action to every mother and every woman who yearns to be one: Let’s use our power in the fight to save children from cancer.

Mothers have a long history of activism when it comes to fighting for voting rights ending segregation and preventing drunk driving. It’s time for us to tackle pediatric cancer by addressing the insufficient research funding and lack of treatments developed specifically for children.

Big pharma’s aversion to unprofitable pediatric cancer drugs

What many don’t realize is that brain cancer is the deadliest form of pediatric cancer. Nearly 5000 children in the US are diagnosed with brain tumors each year. Despite that fact no drug has ever been developed and approved specifically for children with brain tumors.

Pediatric cancer is often more aggressive than adult cancer and the two can differ in molecular makeup. However children are often forced to rely on adult cancer drugs that have dangerous toxicities and side effects including killing healthy cells in children’s developing bodies. The pharmaceutical industry has not prioritized the research and development of cancer drugs for children who represent a much smaller portion of the market compared to adults. When will corporate responsibility become en vogue for this industry that for decades has put profits ahead of doing what’s right?

Children don’t stand a chance in this profit-driven industry when you consider each year adult cancer drugs are some of the best-selling pharmaceuticals for companies like Merck & Co. Pfizer AstraZeneca Bristol-Myers Squibb and Johnson & Johnson.

According to an Evaluate Pharma analysis in 2020 the industry made $145.4 billion on oncology drugs alone and is projected to rake in $311.2 billion by 2026 making up 21% of the pharmaceutical industry’s total sales.

Dispelling the misleading metric of success

On their face the statistics surrounding pediatric cancer look promising and suggest we ought to all breathe a sigh of relief. When you read “Over the last 50 years the survival rates for childhood cancer have risen from 10% to almost 80%” it’s easy to miss the dire need that still exists for more funding for pediatric cancer research and development of more effective — and less harsh — cancer treatments for children.

Although it is true that technology and treatments have improved over the last 50 years resulting in a better overall survival rate the optimistic statistics surrounding pediatric cancer do not tell the whole story.

First of all doctors and researchers use the term “survival rate” to refer to patients who have survived five years since diagnosis. This metric is from the 1930s when surviving cancer for more than five years was a nearly unattainable goal. Second it includes not only children in remission but children still undergoing treatment and children dying from incurable cancers according to Dr. Douglas Hawkins a clinician at Seattle Children’s Hospital and chair of the Children’s Oncology Group. Finally the metric ignores relapses after five years deaths after five years and the burden of chronic health issues among the children who do survive.

According to a 2006 study that tracked the health of adults who were diagnosed with childhood cancer between 1970 and 1986 nearly 40% face severe or life-threatening complications 30 years after diagnosis including kidney failure heart failure secondary cancers loss of hearing or sight and premature death. These complications in most cases are a result of the cancer treatments according to Dr. Greg Armstrong of St. Jude Children’s Hospital.

The consequence of the misleading metric of “survival rates” is that what is not properly measured is not effectively managed. In other words Congress government agencies like the National Institutes of Health and other policy makers are using data that gives only a partial picture of the burden of cancer on children as they develop health policies and make research funding decisions.

A call to action

Mothers can use our collective power to shift how the federal government and pharmaceutical companies prioritize children in the fight against cancer. That means using our platforms to raise awareness about the issue letting our elected officials know we support and expect more funding for our children with cancer. Specifically you can sign this petition and share it with others. The petition urges the Biden administration and Congress to have a comprehensive plan to end pediatric cancer as part of its national plan to eradicate the disease. This should include a plan to both partner with the pharmaceutical industry to incentivize more aggressive development of pediatric cancer drugs and to urge Congress to increase government research funding.

You can also donate to a reputable pediatric cancer charity that allocates a majority of your donation to meaningful research. I chose the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation to honor Blake and because there’s still so much about pediatric brain cancer that’s not understood.

In the fiscal year 2018 the budget for the federally funded National Cancer Institute earmarks just 5% of the agency’s nearly $6 billion budget specifically for pediatric cancer research so giving to legitimate organizations devoted to pediatric cancer is important.

In this movement to make pediatric cancer a national priority we are protecting our children’s futures and their ability to live out their dreams. We are protecting the experiences we hope to share with them as they grow up. A mother’s love is powerful. A woman’s love is powerful. Let us use that power to protect our nation’s most precious resource.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZHBhZ2V0b2RheS5jb20vaGVtYXRvbG9neW9uY29sb2d5L3NraW5jYW5jZXIvOTI0OTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Doubling Down on Immunotherapy in Advanced Melanoma,"Almost 30% of patients with advanced melanoma that progressed on prior checkpoint inhibition responded to pembrolizumab (Keytruda) plus low-dose ipilimumab (Yervoy) according to updated findings from a prospective trial.

Overall 20 of 70 patients had objective responses to the combination including five complete responses. Median duration of response was 16.6 months and the cohort had a median overall survival (OS) exceeding 2 years.

Responses occurred in multiple tumor phenotypes and duration of prior anti-PD-1/L1 treatment did not influence likelihood of response to pembrolizumab and ipilimumab reported Jason J. Luke MD of the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center in Pittsburgh and co-authors in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

""The combination of pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab demonstrated significant antitumor activity and tolerability in a multicenter clinical trial"" they concluded. ""This study demonstrated long-term responses suggesting that durable survival -- a hallmark of immunotherapy activity -- may be possible even after failure of an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody. These findings warrant further investigation and support the ongoing effort to directly compare combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies with ipilimumab in the anti-PD-1/L1 antibody-refractory setting.""

Checkpoint inhibitors (primarily anti-PD-1/L1 and anti-CTLA-4) have revolutionized treatment for advanced melanoma providing durable responses for a substantial fraction of patients. However patients whose disease progresses during or after checkpoint inhibition have few treatment options and a poor prognosis. No prospective trials had evaluated ipilimumab alone or in combination with an anti-PD-1/L1 inhibitor in that setting the authors noted.

A retrospective study of ipilimumab following pembrolizumab failure showed a response rate of about 15%. A more recent retrospective analysis of 355 patients showed response rates of 13% with ipilimumab and 32% with ipilimumab plus an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody.

The retrospective data provided a rationale for a prospective evaluation of the pembrolizumab-ipilimumab combination in patients whose disease had progressed on anti-PD-1/L1 therapy. Luke and co-authors reported findings from a phase II trial evaluating the combination in 70 patients who received standard-dose pembrolizumab and low-dose (1 mg/kg) ipilimumab. An initial report from the study showed that eight of 17 patients responded.

The published update included results for the entire 70-patient cohort. The median time on prior anti-PD-1/L1 therapy was 4.8 months. The authors reported that 60 patients had progressed during treatment with a PD-1/L1 inhibitor and 10 progressed on treatment with an anti-PD-1/L1 combination. The results showed an objective response rate of 29% with the combination of ipilimumab and pembrolizumab. Three additional patients had unconfirmed responses.

Among 66 patients with archival tissue responses occurred in 15 of 39 (38%) PD-L1-negative tumors as compared with four of 27 (15%) PD-L1-positive tumors.

Median progression-free survival was 5.0 months for the entire cohort and median OS was 24.7 months.

Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 62 of 70 patients the most common being pruritis rash diarrhea fatigue nausea and transaminase elevations. Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 27% of patients led by colitis/diarrhea rash and transaminase elevations. The only grade 4 TRAE was concurrent lipase elevation in a patient with grade 3 pancreatitis.

Following a presentation at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting invited discussant Douglas B. Johnson MD of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville found the response rate impressive given the patient population and the tolerability profile favorable. An upfront combination also appeared superior to sequential treatment with a PD-1/L1 inhibitor and ipilimumab he added.

In response to the published findings Johnson told MedPage Today via email ""This is an important study that prospectively shows that adding ipilimumab to anti-PD-1 even after failure of anti-PD-1 alone can be a very active treatment regimen for patients in need of good options.""

During her confirmation hearing in 2022 Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson introduced herself to Congress as an originalist. This surprising move from a presumptively liberal justice signified to many the triumph of originalism as the accepted methodology of the Supreme Court. Jackson was following in the footsteps of Justice Elena Kagan who famously declared that “we are all originalists now” during her own confirmation.

Kagan however came to regret that quip after watching her conservative colleagues implement a series of GOP policy preferences in the name of applying the Constitution’s “original” meaning which is what originalism claims to be. She is surely not the only progressive with second thoughts: The legal left’s embrace of originalism was a major influential development in the 12 years between Kagan’s and Jackson’s elevation to the court—one that’s arguably waning today despite Jackson’s appointment. After three terms of precedent-smashing activism by the Supreme Court’s 6–3 conservative supermajority almost always under the banner of originalism the methodology looks more intellectually bankrupt manipulable and dangerous than ever.

Some liberals have responded with accusations that this supermajority peddles “fauxriginalism” cherry-picking history to fit Republicans’ favored results. This allegation is certainly true but doesn’t answer the underlying question: Is it even a good idea to concede that the “original meaning” of the Constitution—even if it could be reliably ascertained—is the authoritative one? Jackson’s approach illustrates the benefits and risks of trying to beat originalists at their own game from the left. And with each passing term the payoff looks smaller and smaller.

For progressives the problems begin with the origin of the theory. Conservative scholars politicians and activists developed the idea of originalism in response to Brown v. Board of Education—yes the decision that desegregated public school—arguing that the Framers of the 14th Amendment would never have intended to integrate public education. They may have been right about that claim: The same Congress that proposed the 14th Amendment in 1866 segregated the District of Columbia’s public schools while a supermajority of states that ratified the amendment also strictly separated education by race. That doesn’t mean the push toward integration was the wrong move for our country and our 20th-century understanding of what equal rights ought to mean legally. Regardless in the coming decades the burgeoning conservative legal movement refined and pushed the theory to combat other contested Supreme Court decisions including Roe v. Wade Griswold v. Connecticut (birth control) Miranda v. Arizona (self-incrimination) Reynolds v. Sims (malapportionment) and Regents v. Bakke (affirmative action).

Today originalism is the house style of the Federalist Society the lavishly funded network of conservative lawyers who provide intellectual cover for the Republican Party’s preferred policies. It’s propounded to some degree by all six conservative justices who have placed it at the center of their continual smash-and-grab campaign against progressive precedent. When the Supreme Court overruled Roe its justification boiled down to a single claim: Abortion was largely illegal when the 14th Amendment was ratified so it may still be criminalized today. When the court established a new right to carry guns in public it deployed the same reasoning: People could allegedly carry guns in public when the Second Amendment was ratified so they have a right to do so today. And when the court struck down affirmative action? Same story: The original meaning of the equal protection clause requires the law to be “colorblind” the court declared.

This last decision gave Jackson an opportunity to flaunt her skills as a progressive originalist as did an earlier case designed to gut the Voting Rights Act’s remnants. In both she delivered: The justice drew heavily upon the work of historians like Eric Foner who reject the “colorblind” conception of the 14th Amendment in favor of a nuanced interpretation that allows for “race-conscious” remedies to protect minorities’ equal citizenship. Jackson pitched this theory in a lengthy monologue during oral arguments in the voting rights case—her second day on the bench—as if to warn her conservative colleagues that their bogus originalism would no longer go unchallenged. And perhaps her shaming strategy worked since the court ultimately delivered an unlikely victory for the Voting Rights Act.

Jackson’s approach here echoed the work of advocacy groups that seek to employ originalism for progressive ends most prominently the well-respected Constitutional Accountability Center. The goal here is to engage with conservative judges on their own turf demonstrating that their own methodology would actually yield a liberal result if they did it honestly. In short these advocates try to out-originalist the originalists. And on select topics the tactic can work marvels. Race is one example since the conservative fixation with a “colorblind” Constitution so obviously contradicts the historical record. Federal power is another since the Framers clearly gave Congress sweeping powers to regulate commerce. (That’s why Jackson’s most important majority opinion so far is an originalist defense of Congress’ ability to create private rights through its spending power.) Many protections for criminal defendants too like the right to trial by jury and the guarantee against self-incrimination have strong historical foundations.

Other liberties treasured by progressives however do not end up saved by progressive originalism. The Supreme Court’s historical analysis in Dobbs may have been sloppy and inaccurate but that doesn’t change the fact that there’s no evidence Americans thought the 14th Amendment safeguarded abortion back in the 1860s when it was written. Selectively deploying originalism when it bolsters progressive aims does not solve the underlying problem: that as Hawaii Supreme Court Justice Todd Eddins has put it the theory champions the views of “the few white men who made laws and shaped lives during the mostly racist and misogynistic very old days.” This flaw may be most pronounced in cases involving the civil rights of those whom the authors of the Constitution scorned or ignored.

Consider for instance a group of people who were excluded from the political process—indeed from public life—when the 14th Amendment was ratified: women. Sex equality is rooted in the amendment’s equal protection clause which became law in 1868. During this period though in most of the country women had virtually no rights at all. Married women could not own property sign contracts or file lawsuits under the doctrine of “coverture” which subsumed their legal identity into that of their husband. Men could legally beat their wives under the doctrine of chastisement which allowed for “moderate” physical violence in the home. As one court put it in 1868 while upholding the acquittal of a man who whipped his wife the judiciary could “not interfere with family government in trifling cases.” (This history suddenly became relevant when the lower courts struck down a law barring domestic abusers from possessing firearms.)

Conservative litigants are not even shy about citing this evidence when defending discriminatory laws. South Carolina placed it front and center when arguing for same-sex marriage bans in 2015. The state cited congressional debates over the 14th Amendment’s impact on coverture laws that denied women equal citizenship. At the time of the amendment’s adoption some congressmen fretted that the new amendment might restrict the ability of states to discriminate against women. Contemporaneous comments from the primary author of the 14th Amendment himself Rep. John Bingham assured them that the new promise of equality would not interfere with state control over “domestic relations.” His comments reflected a broad consensus from the time reflected in the congressional record that the amendment would not establish equality or even a baseline of civil rights for women. (South Carolina cited this history to show that discrimination against both women and gay people remained constitutional by the way.) If the Supreme Court adopted this reading of the equal protection clause it would have to overturn every past ruling against sex discrimination making husbands the “head and master” of their households once again.

Progressive originalists generally respond to this obstacle by defining rights at a higher level of generality. The Constitutional Accountability Center for example argues that the equal protection clause forbids discrimination against women and gay people by outlawing “class-based” legislation. By denying rights to an entire group of people the theory goes the government condemns them to second-class status stamping them with an impermissible badge of legal inferiority.

It’s a fine idea—but is it really originalism? The answer probably depends on whether you want to salvage originalism or supplant it. If you want to salvage it then sure: It’s perfectly acceptable to define rights so broadly on such an abstract level that they can be squared with the “original meaning” of the Constitution. As George Washington University law professor Peter J. Smith has persuasively argued that is in fact precisely what today’s conservatives already do when mounting an originalist defense of Brown v. Board of Education. Evidence that the 14th Amendment’s Framers supported school segregation is overwhelming. So Brown’s defenders on the right define “equal protection” with sufficient abstraction to mandate integrated public education.

Should progressives want to salvage originalism though? Why step in to shore up a flailing theory that was born out of contempt for Black children women and criminal defendants? A theory that the Supreme Court is currently manipulating to impose conservative policy goals like nationwide public carry under the thin guise of judicial review?

Because originalist justices like Clarence Thomas are so incredibly bad at interpreting history cherry-picking facts and crediting debunked sources it may be tempting to conclude that they’re just doing it wrong. But why do it at all? The strong argument for progressive originalism is the hope that advocates can convince conservative judges to issue liberal decisions if they just present enough historical evidence. That hope feels increasingly hollow. When Thomas is presented with proof that his past views were rooted in bogus history he simply dismisses it. Activist scholars flood the nation’s law journals which are not peer-reviewed with tendentious or outright false historical claims which conservative justices then cite as the gospel truth. This is less like a legitimate judicial or academic enterprise than like a scam to reverse-engineer outcomes to fit a partisan agenda. Pointing out inaccuracies is not going to change the outcomes.

With originalism’s reputation so tarnished maybe progressives should stop co-opting the right’s brand altogether. Maybe they should embrace constitutional values like equality without squeezing them into a framework that was literally designed to shut out minorities from full citizenship. Maybe rather than trying to beat conservatives at their own game progressives should present a competing vision of constitutional interpretation to the public—one which acknowledges that original meaning is often unknowable and too frequently shackled to the antiquated views of dead white men.

“He’s always trying to help somebody. He helps everybody” she said outside their apartment Wednesday.

Police haven’t yet revealed a motive in the slaying but law enforcement sources said the shooting which occurred opposite the Chelsea Career and Technical Education High School may have been school-related.

The slain teen was a student at the nearby Broome Street Academy Charter High School sources added.

It wasn’t immediately clear if Brown was the intended target but sources said the gunfire may have erupted following a dispute between two groups of girls earlier that day.

“The only time you see Mahki is when he’s walking with his girl” the friend said. “I was crying earlier. It just hit me… I thought I was going to push it off but I couldn’t. I did cry.”

Family friend Lakesha Jenkins told The Post the family didn’t know what led to the shooting – only that Brown was helping a friend at the time.

“He is a caring person. He is a respectful kid” Jenkins said outside the teen’s apartment. “We all have love for him.”

His basketball coach Jessica Jenkins echoed that sentiment.

Meanwhile a nearby parking attendant said he ran for cover after hearing at least two gunshots.

“I was protecting myself because you didn’t know where the sound was coming from” he said. “People were running so I also ran.”

In the Las Vegas market its revenues were down just over 39% year-over-year from $822 million during the first quarter of 2020 to $497 million during the opening quarter of this year.

Caesars officials said they expect business in Las Vegas will continue to improve as the year goes on.

“The numbers don’t tell the story this quarter” Reeg said. “We had Illinois and Pennsylvania still closed when we started the quarter. In Nevada we didn’t have the state open to 50% until two weeks were left in the quarter so we saw demand build through the quarter.”

Immersion down through the ages has represented renewal. We wash away what was so that we can embrace what will be. The bigger that submersion the bigger the renewal or at least that’s how it feels floating in the Arabian Gulf. Head half out the slight crackling of fish feeding underneath providing the soundtrack to the reverie as I hang in the water and survey the scene. Ahead of me it’s a study in blue. The cerulean of the shallows gives way to turquoise and then darker azure as the sea reaches out to meet the horizon. The perfect celeste sky stretches up from that intersection punctuated only by the silver crescent moon its lingering presence in daylight adding an ethereal quality to the portrait.



Dipping below the waterline the cool morning sea washes over me that act of immersion sweeping away the world and worries. Emerging invigorated I pan my gaze back to the beach. I’m at the gorgeous Caesars Palace Dubai – its towering grandeur simply titanic a fitting description as exploring this castle by the ocean it appears as if the ill-fated liner had escaped the ravages of the iceberg and pressed on through the decades finally coming to rest here on the shores of the emirate.



Location love

Situation off the coast of Jumeirah Beach Residence and is accessible by bridge – the property overlooks Ain Dubai the soon-to-be world’s tallest observation wheel. The Dubai Marina is just minutes away while it is a 20-minute drive to The Dubai Mall and Burj Khalifa and a further five minutes to the airport.



Living like a Caesar

From the moment me and my husband checked in the property with the friendliest and warmest staff immediately cast its spell on us. The smiles so warm and genuine that they are just infectious!

We are then whisked off to our oasis- the One Bedroom Suite which happens to be one of the finest ones we have stayed at.

We loved the floor-to-ceiling windows and the terrace afford unobstructed views of the Gulf. There are subtle nods to Rome in the room too with coin artworks and horse-head cushions to give a historical feel alongside modern touches such as tablet devices media hubs and Nespresso machines (although the air-conditioning controls prove hard to decipher). There are a couple of hidden gems such as the two-way cabinets that allow guests to have their laundry taken care of by the service team without being disturbed and the pop-up mirrors in the dressing table. Another highlight is the statement curved throne-like tub that could easily fit two people with room to spare and has its own blow-up pillow and accompanying Lorenzo Villoresi Firenze bathroom amenities that are packaged more like store-bought toiletries than the travel-size ones I’m used to.



The 178 sleek rooms and suites in chic cream and slate grey tones feature Romanesque details like horse head cushions Roman coin artworks and chariot-esque high-backed bathtubs alongside 21st-century tech like suite pads to order room service media hubs for connecting your devices via Bluetooth and Nespresso machines.

Home comforts include down bedding Frette linen pillow menus and luxe Lorenzo Villoresi Firenze toiletries with thoughtful touches like pop-up lighted mirrors in the dressing table and discreet two-way valet cabinets allowing laundry to be delivered or used plates removed without disturbance. Suite guests benefit from butler services such as in-suite check-in packing and unpacking and shoe shining.



The chill life

What we loved the most was the private beach that has unobstructed sea views (a rarity in Dubai). The Cove Beach boasts of a stunning seafront locale that comprises a restaurant the one-of-a-kind Rosé Lounge and not one not two but three temperature-controlled infinity pools to splash away the stresses. You can also do your workouts in the Fitness Gallery a 24-hour gym equipped with the latest Technogym equipment. If you prefer more guidance yoga meditation high-intensity training kickboxing and aqua fit classes are on offer.

Meanwhile if you’re looking for a bit of adventure choose from an array of water sports like jet skiing wakeboarding stand-up paddleboarding and kayaking.

With plenty of entertainment options the hotel is as much about going on a fun island vacation as it is about getting away from it all — though you’re less than a 30-minute drive from Dubai’s top tourist attractions.

I would wake up to a glass calm ocean and head l out to my balcony the aroma of my morning coffee mixed with the view from my lofty tower. A sea fret covers the land in a gossamer mist and I sit somewhat spellbound frozen in time. Another showstopper here is the Qua Spa where time melts merely away given the best-in-class treatments and facilities it boasts. It is an award-winning wellness concept from Las Vegas where Japanese technologies and luxurious spa treatments soothe the mind and body.



Spa sojourns

The first of its kind in the UAE the Iyashi Dome at Qua Spa uses state-of-the-art infrared rays to deeply cleanse the body restore its balance and gain efficient and long-lasting slimming effects. Inspired by traditional Japanese practice ‘Suna Ryoho’ – where the locals bury themselves in the sand near hot springs on the beach to eliminate toxins this spa treatment also burns up to 600 calories a session making it a must for wellness connoisseurs looking for a serious detox.

I love how an array of wet facilities such as rock saunas aroma steam rooms experience showers and ice fountains help you unwind before a treatment.

As a spa connoisseur it’s worth pointing out that what stands out about this spa is that there is no attempt at forcing the idea of tranquility here; instead it’s all very contemporary with earthy gray tones light wooden beams a bright reception area with a boutique and well-lit corridors.

I tried the Signature Senses collection massage combined with a Golden facial by Carol Joy on the innovative ultra-relaxing and easing Quartz bed.

Based on hot sand therapy originally used in Ancient Egypt to treat medical ailments the groundbreaking Psammo Concept Quartz Bed is derived from the age-old concept of thermal therapy for mental and physical relaxation. Integrating the multiple benefits of sand therapy aromatherapy inversion therapy and wave-like massage the quartz sand bed treatment offers the chance to experience something truly special.

A relaxation session on the warm quartz bed is combined with herbal compresses of frankincense a cedar wood massage and the application of a spicy muscle balm to banish stress.

The massage is followed by an exceptional facial using the Carol Joy London products that have 24 carat gold to encourage cell regeneration. I drifted into a slumber filled with visions of tropical wellness and then emerged two hours later with my skin feeling creamier tighter and more even and my body and mind rejuvenated to the core.



The food factor

Invigorated if a little fuzzy it’s time for dinner at the celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay’s world-famous restaurant Hell’s Kitchen. While Ramsay is not a permanent fixture the celebrity chef does visit and has a strong culinary team to keep things cooking when he’s not around. The signature eatery has an enormous illuminated pitchfork marking the entrance and is decked out in red and blue modelled on the show’s kitchen. It’s not just about the theatre of service but about the quality of the food. The Signature Beef Wellington and Hell’s Kitchen Beef Burger scream craftsmanship in every bite and are definitely worth forking out for and leave us sated satisfied and sleepy.

Also worth trying are authentic dim sum and hand-pulled noodles at pan-Asian restaurant Zhen Wei where signature dishes include whole Beijing duck Cantonese sea bass and kung pao lobster.

Furthermore we loved the smashing desserts (think Passion fruit Cheesecake Citrus Mille Feuille the finest fruit tarts) and coffee at the Roman Lounge- the best we’ve had. The Venus Pool & Bar also offers a sophisticated adults-only pool experience along with light treats and cocktails. Our pick here is the addictive Truffle Mushroom Pizza that is sure to tantalizingly tease your tastebuds.



Verdict

While the property totally owns it all: exceptional food facilities service location views beach and more. However having said that the secret to the Caesars Palace Dubai isn’t however the food or the view the room or even the sea. It is the army of staff by the pool or the restaurant front-desk or housekeeping that surprises us with rose-petal bath setups and delectable desserts by bed. It is the janitor who asks me and husband when we can come back next and bids a heartfelt goodbye. Also several team members too numerous to mention who epitomise hospitality.

You recognise as you drive away from this resort that you were able to immerse yourself in a brief moment out of everyday life and thus leave renewed and ready to dive into what comes next.

As I leave I have a sense of being lost in a delirious soup of cosmic consciousness. To me clearly emerging as the king of the crop is Caesars Palace Dubai and reaffirms the emirate as the Vegas of the Middle East. There is an incredible natural high that comes from being surrounded by the great spirit of the place. It is being polished primed and opened up with reverence; so too are you.

Double rooms from AED 1545 (£330) in low season; and from AED 2745 (£590) in high.

Online poker play may be on the verge of a comeback in Nevada

Say hello to curling the next competitive sport in Las Vegas

Sports wagering still hasn’t begun in Arizona but that hasn’t stopped professional sports franchises from preparing for that startup when it occurs later this year.

Caesars Entertainment which acquired the William Hill franchise in Nevada announced last week that it is partnering with the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball to place a sportsbook sports bar and a broadcast studio at the location formerly known as Game 7 Grill on the Plaza at Chase Field the Diamondbacks’ home stadium. The deal additionally enables Caesars/William Hill to provide mobile wagering within the state.

The new deal has spurred conversation about whether stadium sportsbooks should be considered in Nevada.

The legislation for sports wagering in the Grand Canyon State offers licenses for 20 locations — 10 for Arizona sports franchises and 10 for tribal casinos.

The state’s major franchises include the Diamondbacks the NFL’s Arizona Cardinals based at State Farm Stadium in Glendale; the NHL’s Arizona Coyotes who play at Gila River Arena not far from the football stadium; and the NBA’s Phoenix Suns who play at downtown Phoenix Suns Arena.

That leaves room for other potential sportsbook-supporting venues involved in PGA tournaments and Phoenix Raceway the home of an annual NASCAR Cup race.

There are 20 Indian tribes based in the state from the Apaches to the Zunis with some of them already closely engaged with the state’s sports community. It shouldn’t take long for the state to sort out who will be sportsbook licensees.

The new Arizona sports venue sportsbook model has generated new conversations about whether sportsbooks should be located in Nevada stadiums.

Jeremy Aguero whose Applied Analysis firm serves as the staff for the Las Vegas Stadium Authority said he has heard some of the conversations about stadium sportsbooks.

“I think from the beginning it was determined that Allegiant Stadium was going to be neutral ground for sports wagering and that’s why it has been written into our agreements that there won’t be gambling devices installed on stadium property” Aguero said. “It hasn’t been brought up as a proposal by anybody but that doesn’t mean that couldn’t happen at some point.”

The likely reason it hasn’t come up is that the sports wagering market in Las Vegas is vastly different from Arizona’s and other places where in-stadium sportsbooks have been developed such as Washington D.C.

Nevada has several sportsbooks close to our stadiums. Mandalay Bay and Luxor have their BetMGM books in those casinos.

New York-New York and Park MGM are next door to T-Mobile Arena where the NHL’s Vegas Golden Knights play. Red Rock Resort is near Las Vegas Ballpark home of Triple-A baseball’s Aviators and when it opens the AHL’s Henderson Silver Knights’ Dollar Loan Center arena will be near Green Valley Ranch. The Knights’ current home is at Orleans Arena which has its own book.

It’s also true that most serious sports bettors have at least one or two sportsbook apps on the phones in their pockets and bettors are able to make wagers whenever they want during a game. The Nevada Gaming Control Board reported last month that more than 60 percent of sports wagers were made with an app in March.

Aguero concedes that it’s always possible something would change the dynamic that could lead to changing the rules at Allegiant Stadium. He said the Las Vegas Raiders haven’t initiated any requests for sports betting at the stadium.

What could change that? Possibly new sports wagering legislation in California. If California’s NFL teams — the Rams Chargers and 49ers — could create a financial advantage over the Raiders with an in-stadium sportsbook sponsorship there could be a conversation about evening the playing field.

Right now that looks like a long shot at best considering that California has yet to legalize sports betting and the direction California tribes want that to go.

Tribes have submitted an initiative petition that calls for sports betting at California’s 69 tribal casinos and four commercial racetracks a measure that would be on the state’s 2022 ballot.

Professional sports teams meanwhile are considering their own sports-betting initiative.

There’s no clear path as to how or if sports betting would arrive in California.

In the second half of 2020 online gambling stocks were some of the hottest growth stocks on the market. DraftKings (DKNG -1.13%) started a trend when it went public via SPAC merger but Penn National (PENN -1.57%) Rush Street Interactive (RSI -0.48%) Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG) and Gan Ltd (GAN 2.50%) all joined the party by hitting public markets or making deals to expand in online gambling.

The euphoria that drove those gains is quickly being unwound in 2021 partly due to the sell-off in growth stocks and partly because expectations may have gotten too high for online gambling. Here's how you should be looking at the market and the leading stocks in the space.

Casinos are open again

One of the reasons online gambling stocks did so well in 2020 was because physical casinos were closed. People who wanted to gamble needed to do so online and revenue jumped as a result.

We haven't seen a decline in online gambling revenue yet but we are starting to see very bullish signs from physical casino operators. Caesars Entertainment (CZR -0.36%) said this week that weekends are essentially sold out and they are expecting a big rebound in revenue in the second half of the year.

If there are limited discretionary entertainment and gambling dollars to be spent a rise in spending at the casino could translate to less spending online. That's at least one reason online casino stocks have been down recently.

Online gambling is far from profitable

Investors are also starting to see that online gambling companies are far from profitable and likely won't make money for years. It's very expensive to reach new customers resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on sales and marketing and it's far from clear when these companies will report net income.

Let's take DraftKings as a proxy for the industry because it's the biggest publicly traded pure-play company in the U.S. You can see below that revenue is growing quickly but sales general and administrative expenses exceed revenue and losses are accelerating.

This could reverse course as the company gets larger and customer acquisition costs fall but that could be years from now. And with sky-high valuations investors have soured on the long runway these companies may have to profitability.

Waiting in the wings

What I'll be watching in 2021 is how established casino operators react to the online gambling market. Companies like Caesars MGM Resorts (MGM -1.48%) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN -1.52%) have their own online gambling operations and established brands. They will be able to use cash flow from their existing businesses to fund online gambling growth and if they take market share from digital players who are burning cash it could be bad for stocks like DraftKings Rush Street Interactive and Golden Nugget Online.

If stocks continue to fall we could even see these companies poach online gambling stocks to bolt onto their own operations. Las Vegas Sands (LVS 0.11%) has indicated its interest in buying online gambling assets in some form and that could be a possibility if stock prices fall.

Until online gambling companies prove they're sustainable long term I'm going to have a hard time betting on the industry. For now my money is on MGM Resorts translating its industry-leading brands and growing online gambling business into a juggernaut in the industry. And it can wait years for the online gambling market to mature something online-only companies may not have the financial flexibility to do."

The Chicago-based carrier restarted flying to New York-JFK on March 28 a move that came nearly six years after pulling out of the market. In October 2015 the carrier consolidated its JFK routes to Newark where it has a hub. Current United CEO Scott Kirby once described the move as a strategic mistake and ""the wrong decision"" since the carrier ultimately lost lucrative corporate contracts to its competitors that continued flying to JFK.

For now the carrier is flying just two routes to New York's largest airport — from both Los Angeles (LAX) and San Francisco (SFO) — and pending slot constraints more may be on the way.

With the premium transcontinental designation — and some intense competition — United's current JFK flights are some of the highest-profile ones in the entire domestic network.

Exactly one month since the relaunch I decided to give United's newest flagship flight a try. Here's how it went. (Note that United knew I was onboard so this isn't a formal review and I won't be commenting on any of the service elements in this story.)

Swankiest jet in the fleet

To underscore the importance of the JFK flights United's deploying its swankiest jet — the ""high-J"" Boeing 767-300ER — on the new transcons.

This plane is outfitted with just 167 seats spread across three cabins with a whopping 46 Polaris biz pods 22 Premium Plus recliners and 99 coach seats 43 of which sport extra legroom.

With 16 rows the single Polaris business-class cabin occupies nearly half of the entire plane's interior.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

When this premium-heavy configuration was first devised United's strategy was to send the plane on key business routes like New York and Chicago to London.

Of course the pandemic has essentially wiped away much of that demand so the carrier is getting creative with its aircraft assignments.

Throughout the summer the carrier will fly the ""high-J"" Boeing 767 on flagship leisure routes like Newark (EWR) and San Francisco (SFO) to Maui (OGG) in the hopes that it can command a revenue premium for the top-notch onboard product.

As for JFK United is making a splashy entrance. There seemingly isn't enough demand right now to occupy 46 business-class seats but it sets the carrier up for success when that demand eventually returns.

Easy upgrades

If you're looking to score the fancy seats this is the route to fly.

As mentioned the jet's outsized business-class cabin means there are often unsold Polaris pods in the days and weeks leading up to departure frequently making for an easy upgrade.

Case in point: on my flight 17 biz upgrades cleared including a handful of which were non-revenue standbys.

Anecdotally I've heard similar reports from other travelers and taking a look at the upgrade list for the next few days seems to confirm that the nice seats are being filled with last-minute upgrades.

You can upgrade to either premium economy or business class using PlusPoints or MileagePlus miles. (You earn the former as a top-tier Premier elite member.) The transcon route requires 20 PlusPoints for a bump to either premium economy or biz. If you're already booked into premium economy you can save 10 PlusPoints for the biz upgrade.

If you're looking to upgrade with miles check out the upgrade award chart to determine how many miles and dollars are required.

Lounge access is limited to the West Coast

If you're flying in biz on United's premium transcon service your ticket includes lounge access.

United operates clubs at both its LAX and SFO hubs but the carrier doesn't have an outpost in its JFK home Terminal 7. The carrier gave up its lounge there when it moved out in 2015. United is ""working on"" setting up lounge access at JFK for premium flyers but there's nothing to report yet.

Right now I personally wouldn't consider this a major drawback — at least not right now. Most lounges that have reopened are operating with limited services and some are once again overcrowded.

Unlike American Airlines United's premium transcon flyers aren't invited into the business-class-only Polaris lounges

Priority Pass members can normally access the Alaska Airlines lounge in JFK's Terminal 7 but it's temporarily shuttered due to the pandemic.

Polaris pods are a great way to fly

On my flight I purchased a $219 premium economy ticket and then applied 10 PlusPoints for the biz upgrade — a worthwhile investment in my opinion.

The Polaris cabin is arranged in a 1-1-1 configuration offering direct aisle access to every traveler. The one downside to this arrangement is that couples can't sit next to each other.

Some window seats are adjacent to the aisle though my personal preference is to select one that's flush with the fuselage for added privacy.

I was quite happy with my seat choice 17L for this leg. It's next to the window and provides a good overview of the 16-row cabin.

The only drawback is the proximity to the lavatory but I didn't find it bothersome for a five-hour day flight.

Each seat converts into a lie-flat bed at the touch of a dial.

The tray table slides out from under the inflight entertainment monitor and it's equipped with a built-in tablet stand that makes it easier to simultaneously watch a show and eat.

Finally there's a small storage compartment next to each seat which doubles as a vanity mirror when opened.

For more details about United's Polaris pods check out TPG's full review.

An amenity boost

During the height of the pandemic United trimmed the Saks Fifth Avenue amenities distributed on premium transcon routes. Previously biz passengers would receive a plush Saks-branded duvet.

That's since been replaced with a much flimsier throw blanket.

The good news however is that to coincide with the JFK debut United has added the cooling gel pillow that's usually reserved for long-haul international flights.

As for the other amenities biz flyers receive a standard pillow and bare-bones amenity pouch with a postcard eyeshade dental kit earplugs and Sunday Riley-branded lip balm.

A pandemic cut to food service

While United has cut meals from most domestic routes premium transcons remain an exception. Biz flyers are served an individually wrapped single-course meal with the ability to choose from one of two entrees.

Unfortunately however the quality of the food has declined substantially from before the pandemic. Previously those in the pointy end of the plane were presented with a menu card and served a multi-course meal consisting of a welcome drink and mixed nuts an appetizer course with a bread basket a choice of three entrees and a dessert trolley featuring a create-your-own ice cream sundae bar.

On my flight I was served breakfast with the choice between an egg frittata and French toast. I asked for both — there were empty seats in biz — but neither were great.

I recognize that breakfast is one of the weakest airplane meals and United is still streamlining its catering due to the pandemic but I was nevertheless disappointed with the offerings.

After all take a look at what JetBlue serves for lunch in its Mint cabin on the exact same route in April and May 2021. There's no comparison.

United has also cut the pre-arrival sandwiches from the premium transcon routes due to the pandemic. If you're still hungry after the first meal you can ask for some nosh from the (well-stocked) snack basket.

Drink up

Despite United's uninspiring meal service the carrier has recently invested in its drink options.

In addition to the standard assortment of non-alcoholic drinks UA recently unveiled a revamped alcoholic beverage menu which features Michelob Ultra Breckenridge Brewery juice drop hazy IPA Kona Brewing Co. Big Wave Golden Ale and White Claw mango-flavored hard seltzer a United exclusive.

They join the existing liquor selections including my personal favorite the On The Rocks Old Fashioned. Despite the early hour I tried some of the new options and definitely appreciated the investment United is making to offer a differentiated beverage menu.

Premium Plus isn't a bad deal either

If you're looking for a bit more space without breaking the bank you might want to consider premium economy instead of Polaris. The 22 recliners are arranged in a 2-2-2 configuration with no middles.

The seats are essentially the same as domestic first-class with a few added bells and whistles like a leg rest and footrest.

The seat-back entertainment monitors are a bit larger than coach and the inflight service on this leg largely mirrors that in biz.

You'll receive a single-course meal after takeoff as well as a choice of non-alcoholic drink followed by a snack basket before landing.

Bottom line

United's new JFK flights are some of the highest-profile ones in the entire network.

The carrier deploys its premium-heavy Boeing 767 with a ton of lie-flat pods occupying nearly half of the plane. While the Polaris hard product is top-notch United could consider restoring the pre-pandemic meal service.

After all as the transcon competition heats up and travel picks up once again United ought to bring its A-game if it wants to win back the customers it lost five years ago when it pulled out of JFK.

It is also one of the busiest feeding a whopping 68 million people per day—about 1% of the world's population. You could say that Mickey D's is the unofficial cafeteria of the world. So how is it possible that there still remains one U.S. state capital that doesn't have a single McDonald's restaurant?

The chain currently operates restaurants in every U.S. state capital except in Montpelier Vt. which is incredible when you think about it. That means you can get a Big Mac as far out as Honolulu—even Juneau. But if you're looking for Golden Arches in the Green Mountain State's capital you'll need to keep on trucking.

Chick-fil-A May Not Be Welcome in This State

Make no mistake: McDonald's does business in Vermont. As of 2016 the franchise had 30 Vermont locations—not the strongest presence but at least better than North Dakota which has just 29. So what could account for McDonald's absence from Montpelier—culturally and politically one of Vermont's most visible cities? Vermonters over on Reddit have their theories. Some believe it comes down to the fact that there's already a McDonald's in the neighboring town of Barre. Another speculated that Montpelier is simply holding out for bragging rights.

McDonald's has attempted to set up shop in Montpelier before. In 1996 a Montpelier landlord Jeff Jacobs applied for a permit to convert a historic bank building into a McDonald's restaurant. Jacobs' request was denied on the grounds that a Mcdonald's at the proposed location (a busy intersection) would create traffic problems. Jacobs appealed the decision to Vermont's Supreme Court and initiated an $8 million lawsuit but neither case made it to court.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Jacobs' story is in keeping with larger trends in Montpelier. As Business Insider noted in a 2017 article on the topic Montpelier is better disposed to local businesses than it is to large national chains and so the fast-food giant's absence from the capital city is in some ways unsurprising. A case in point: nether of McDonald's top two competitors—Burger King and Wendy's—has restaurants in Montpelier.

Ultimately being the only state without a McDonald's in its capital does remain one of Vermont's calling cards. Bernie Sanders one of Vermont's most famous residents certainly has no problem tweaking the fast-food chain. It's not personal though. Just a Vermont thing.

Instead if you're flying on a United Airlines Boeing 767 on a domestic or short-haul international flight you can sit in the crew rest that's usually reserved for flight attendants on the carrier's longest flights — but you'll have to monitor the seat map to see when they open up.

While some jets feature crew bunks above or below the passenger compartments United's 767s — both the -300 and -400 variants — are outfitted with four extra-reclining coach seats for flight attendants. There's a thick curtain that can be closed to cordon off the seats from the rest of the cabin when the crew rest is in use.

While flight attendants use these seats during downtime on long-haul flights domestic hops and shorter international jaunts don't include breaks for the crew.

That's when they're available to passengers — and they're a major upgrade compared to a typical coach-class seat.

The four seats are located in the last two rows of the cabin on the port side of the jet. They feature a leg rest footrest a ton of extra legroom and generous recline.

They also sport an oversized tray table that pops out from the fixed armrest making it easier to work during the flight.

You'll find the standard coach amenities like personal TVs and power outlets at these seats as well.

Of course some flyers might prefer to be closer to the front of the plane far away from the galley but I'd personally sacrifice seat location in exchange for added space and comfort.

United generally blocks these seats in the weeks and months leading up to a flight as you'll see in the ExpertFlyer screenshot below with the blue boxes and white X's in Row 43 and Row 44 Seats A and B.

Then within a day or two or departure they're released for assignment. United labels them as extra-legroom Economy Plus seats so they come at an upcharge for regular flyers. Premier elites can choose these seats for free depending on their status tier.

For an upcoming flight between New York-JFK and Los Angeles United was charging $72 to upgrade. That's the exact same cost as the other standard extra-legroom seats except those don't feature a leg rest footrest or nearly as much additional space.

Premier Platinum and 1K members can choose extra-legroom seats — including the crew-rest versions —for free for themselves and up to eight companions any time after booking subject to availability. Mid-tier Gold flyers can bring one companion for free and can reserve them any time after booking as well. Silver members also get one free companion but they can only snag the extra-legroom seats beginning at the 24-hour check-in window.

Health Department fills a syringe with Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Read more

In the early stages of the COVID pandemic as most of the world sought hope amid soaring death tolls and sinking economies a New Jersey company looked ahead and readied itself for the moment when a medical solution would arrive.

Anticipating the development of vaccines as well as a red-hot worldwide demand for its products Becton Dickinson the world’s leading syringe manufacturer ramped up production at plants in the U.S. Asia and Europe early in 2020.

Hundreds of millions of orders poured in from across the globe and in response the Franklin Lakes-based company produced 1 billion more needles and syringes than in a typical year an increase of more than 2000 a minute.

“There was such an aggressive time frame for the vaccines that governments wanted them by the end of 2020 or early 2021” said Troy Kirkpatrick a BD vice president. “We tried to push out as many as we could. By the end of last year we had more than 300 million delivered around the world.”

In the fight against COVID the hastily developed vaccines are the stars of the story. But the inoculation of billions also requires billions of syringes and BD and its competitors here and abroad have been working overtime to churn them out.

“This is the type of global health challenge BD was built to address” CEO Tom Polen wrote in a letter to shareholders.

The company which manufactures medical devices medical supplies lab equipment and diagnostic products has 70000 employees and operations in 50 countries. It reported $17.1 billion in revenue in 2020 with sales of its syringes and other injection devices accounting for $3.6 billion. Its stock closed at $239.39 on Friday just a little higher than three years ago.

Most of America’s COVID needles come from BD’s four Nebraska plants and one in Connecticut places that already were operating around the clock to make the injection devices needed for annual flu shots childhood vaccines and everyday medical uses.

“That’s why we started contacting governments so early” said Kirkpatrick. “When you’re going to need billions of additional devices even for a company like ours that already makes multiple billions it takes time. And we didn’t want to impact existing production.”

Despite the surge BD has hired very few new workers according to spokesperson Alyssa Kretlow instead tweaking existing procedures to accommodate the additional output.

“For some new lines there might have been increases in the work force but in general those facilities were already going 24-7” said Kretlow. “What we’ve been really able to do to is use our flexibility and offer our employees additional training.”

While BD has produced conventional 1- and 3-milliliter syringes for this vaccination effort it’s also made millions of low dead-volume syringes which are designed to minimize empty spaces and limit waste.

A recent Food and Drug Administration ruling permitted low dead-volume syringes to extract six doses from each vaccine vial. Traditional needles had a maximum of five.

Made of stainless steel and plastic or glass the syringes are packed and shipped not to pharmaceutical firms to be filled with medication but to federal government warehouses where they are then distributed to states either in bulk or as part of pre-packaged vaccine kits.

“Traditionally we go through distributors and then our customers order through them” Kirkpatrick said. “But with COVID it’s been the government placing the orders and doing the distributing.”

Shipped in glass vials most of the COVID vaccines require refrigeration. BD’s needles arrived at their destinations empty unlike those that are pre-filled and used for say flu shots. That required a new learning curve for many countries especially in Europe.

“In Europe where there are mostly state-run health systems the governments were used to buying vaccines for their populations” said Kirkpatrick. “But almost all were given in pre-filled format. They never had to worry about ordering the injection system separately. So we had to educate them.”

Most of these COVID devices used in the U.S. also have safety caps to prevent accidental sticks a necessary precaution since so many of those working at the sites have never administered shots before.

Founded in 1897 BD produced the first hypodermic needle used for insulin injections as well as the first disposable syringe. Its first major acquisition in 1904 was the Philadelphia Surgical Co. Major competitors in the injection-device market now include American firms like Retractable Technologies Inc. Smiths Medical Inc. Cardinal Health as well as several Chinese manufacturers.

While the COVID-generated surge has helped its bottom line Kirkpatrick said the BD-produced item that had the biggest impact last year was a new diagnostic test.

“While we’re certainly seeing an increase in syringe sales” he said “the rapid and molecular COVID tests we developed actually did better for us.”

BD recently partnered with the U.S. government on a $70 million expansion of its manufacturing capacity at the Nebraska plants. That will allow the U.S. to stockpile the devices for future outbreaks.

And should COVID vaccinations continue in years to come BD anticipates a transition to pre-filled syringes.

“Pre-filled is a lot easier more efficient” said Kirkpatrick. “You don’t have to draw vaccine out of a vial which typically involves some waste. We don’t know what’s going to happen in the future but if the demand spikes we want to be ready.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

This will undoubtedly be a worry for booked guests especially with more than a year of suspensions and uncertainty on resuming operations this summer.

Where Are August Cruises?

The Miami-based cruise line has now removed most cruises in August except for three vessels. Currently the Carnival website shows bookings for Carnival Breeze and Carnival Vista out of the Port of Galveston in Texas and the Carnival Horizon out of PortMiami Florida. Only from September are more ships currently available to book

The cruise line has not released any reason why most cruises are removed through August but there is a likely reason. Carnival removed most sailings except for those same three cruise ships through July and here was the reason:

So it’s likely to be the same case for the August sailings which are now no longer available for booking. The cruises may just be closed for new bookings are not actually canceled. However many times now when the cruise line removed cruises from its site there is often a further suspension announced not long after.

Carnival Website

With the ongoing situation between the cruise industry and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention on resuming cruises anything is possible. Cruise lines are not happy with Phases 2B and 3 released from the CDC on May 5 2021. Those instructions cause even further restrictions and a lack of clarity which have already been called a “joke” by Florida’s Governor and “absurd” by Norwegian Cruise CEO Frank Del Rio.

It’s looking more possible that Carnival Breeze Carnival Vista and Carnival Horizon are the very first ships in the fleet that will restart operations this summer. With Carnival Breeze and Horizon already arriving back in Galveston Texas prorations have already started including crew member vaccinations.

Carnival Horizon is a Miami-based ship and we already know that PortMiami has commenced crew vaccinations across Royal Caribbean Celebrity Cruises and MSC cruise ships.

Carnival Cruise Line has also extended the final payment date to May 31 2021 to provide further confidence for guests. It means guests can request a full refund and cancel without any penalty.

For now we’ll just have to wait and see what Carnival decides doing this summer. The CDC has said it’s aiming to allow cruises by mid-summer and has been working with the cruise lines to make it happen.

Will Carnival Cruise Line go down the pathway of simulated sailings or will it decide to skip them and offer cruises with fully vaccinated crew and passengers?

The idea of signing up for a complimentary (free) test cruise and be able to get back to sea first as well as help test out new protocols for the cruise lines is very appealing to many cruise fans.

Part of the CDC's plan for cruise ships to resume sailings is for each cruise ship to conduct a simulated voyage where the crew can go through a variety of scenarios and demonstrate the different rules and changes cruise lines have made can keep passengers and crew members safe from the global health crisis.

It is not clear yet if or when cruise lines will ask for help from the public to come onboard for a test sailing but if they do here is what you need to know.

Who can volunteer for a test cruise?

The CDC says any test cruise must rely on volunteers simulating the role of passengers and there are rules about who can (and cannot) sign up as a volunteer.

Here are the rules to be a volunteer:

Volunteer passengers must be at least eighteen years old or older on the day of the simulation and at the time that their consent to participate is obtained.

All volunteers must have either: Proof of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19

or Written documentation from a healthcare provider or self-certified statement that the volunteer passenger has no medical conditions that would place the volunteer at high risk for severe COVID-19 as determined through CDC guidance.

Volunteers cannot be paid and/or be part of the test as part of a condition of employment or in exchange for consideration or future reward.

All volunteer passengers must be evaluated for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 prior to embarkation and disembarkation.

All volunteer passengers must agree in writing to post-disembarkation specimen collection for COVID-19 testing at 3 to 5 days after completion of the simulated voyage.

What do volunteers have to do on a test cruise?

Test cruises are not just regular cruise vacations. These are intended to put the crew members and new rules through their paces and ensure the vessel can operate in a safe and effective manner despite the global health crisis.

While volunteers will be onboard to enjoy a cruise their primary function is acting as support for the necessary tasks the cruise line has to complete in order for a ship to given permission to sail.

Each ship has to conduct at least one test sailing in order to gain permission from the CDC to sail. Each test cruise must be between 2-7 days in length with a least one overnight stay.

The CDC recommends a minimum voyage length of 3 days with 2 overnight stays.

The following activities must be simulated onboard each ship for which the cruise ship operator intends to commence restricted passenger voyages before applying for a COVID-19 Conditional Sailing Certificate:

Embarkation and disembarkation procedures as approved by U.S. port and local health authorities as part the cruise ship operator’s Phase 2A agreements including procedures for terminal check-in.

Onboard activities including seating and meal service at dining and entertainment venues.

Medical evacuation procedures.

Transfer of symptomatic passengers or crew or those who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 from cabins to isolation rooms.

Onboard and shoreside isolation and quarantine as per the terms of the cruise ship operator’s Phase 2A agreements of at least 5% of all passengers and non-essential crew.

Recreational activities that the cruise ship operator intends to offer as part of any restricted passenger voyages e.g. casinos spa services fitness classes gymnasiums.

Private-island shore excursions if any are planned during restricted passenger voyages. The following measures must be observed on the private island: Only one ship can port at the island at any one time. A routine screening testing protocol must be implemented for island staff who are expected to interact with volunteer passengers or crew. Mask use and social distancing must be observed on the island.



Port of call shore excursions if any are planned during restricted passenger voyages. The following measures must be observed on port of call shore excursions: Self-guided or independent exploration by passengers during port stops must be prohibited. Shore excursions must only include passengers and crew from the same ship. Cruise ship operator must ensure all shore excursion tour companies facilitate social distancing mask wearing and other COVID-19 public health measures throughout the tour. Cruise ship operators must have a protocol for managing persons with COVID-19 and close contacts at all foreign ports of call. At a minimum the protocol must include the following: Disembarkation and housing of persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 needing shore-based hospital care and their travel companion(s) for the duration of their isolation or quarantine period. Commercial repatriation of U.S.-based persons with COVID-19 and close contacts only after meeting criteria to end isolation and quarantine per CDC guidance. For commercial repatriation of foreign-based persons with COVID-19 and close contacts cruise ship operators must consult with all relevant public health authorities.



It is up to the cruise line if they will do all of these in one test sailing or do some across many test sailings.

Cruise lines can skip test sailings if they choose a different option

In lieu of conducting a test cruise the CDC has given cruise lines a new choice that allows them to completely skip the test cruises if they require vaccines for passengers.

If a ship has at least 98% vaccinated crew and 95% vaccinated passengers the CDC will allow a ship to bypass test cruises.

It is not yet clear if cruise lines will go for this choice although Norwegian Cruise Line wanted to restart cruises with 100% vaccinated passengers and crew prior to this new option.

How to sign up as a volunteer for a test cruise

Thus far only one cruise line has provided a means of signing up for a test cruise although there has been no updates on how volunteers will be picked.

Royal Caribbean has a form set up where you can sign up as well as a Facebook group where you can talk with other people interested in volunteering.

Royal Caribbean’s call for volunteers in November received 100000 signatures in the first week. At least an additional 150000 have reportedly signed up since.

Norwegian Cruise Line Carnival Cruise Line MSC Cruises and Disney Cruise Line have not announced any way to sign up for a test cruise yet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiczcuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMTAvbG9jYWxzLWVuam95LWZpZXN0YS13ZXN0LXRleGFzLWFzLWl0LWNvbWVzLXRvLWFuLWVuZC10aGlzLXdlZWtlbmQv0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzNy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8xMC9sb2NhbHMtZW5qb3ktZmllc3RhLXdlc3QtdGV4YXMtYXMtaXQtY29tZXMtdG8tYW4tZW5kLXRoaXMtd2Vla2VuZC8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Locals enjoy Fiesta West Texas as it comes to an end this weekend,"ODESSA Texas (KOSA) -Fiesta West Texas is the largest outdoor gathering in the Permian Basin since the state reopened.

Avelo Airlines emerged in April as one of two new U.S.-based low-cost airlines—the other being Breeze Airways—and has already committed to equipping its fleet of Boeing 737s with in-flight connectivity (IFC) in the future. However adoption of IFC by low-cost carriers in the U.S. and globally remains mixed with many airlines opting for flights with no internet access to keep operating costs down.

While airline passenger surveys in recent years consistently show the demand for in-flight internet is there for air travelers the economics of modifying aircraft and paying a broadband service bill to offer the service onboard still don’t add up for most operators using the low-cost model. Avelo’s April debut and forward-looking strategy provide a glimpse into why IFC adoption among this segment of the commercial airline industry remains low.

Operating a fleet of 189-seat Boeing 737s fares for Avelo start as low as $19 and their primary focus is connecting their initial base at Hollywood Burbank Airport with 11 destinations in the western U.S. Flights average as low as pre-tax $48 to $68 based on a search of flights to various destinations from Burbank on Avelo’s website. Considering Avelo’s preference to keep fares overwhelmingly low will it be possible to integrate the cost of modifying their aircraft with antennas and modems that also require investment in associated broadband internet service for passengers?

Avelo Airlines Boeing 737s will feature no seatback screens and their future in-flight connectivity investment will be focused on providing Internet access on passenger mobile devices. Avelo

Victoria Stennes vice president of customer experience for Avelo told Avionics International that the airline does eventually expect to introduce in-flight internet and explained how they’re keeping fares low while allowing for connected aircraft investment.

“We haven’t announced more details yet around in-flight internet availability but we do plan to offer this to our customers in the future. We plan to charge a nominal fee for internet access to simply recoup the cost of operating this service but this is not profit-driven” Stennes said.

Since their launch of a daily round-trip flight from Burbank to Sonoma County California on Apr. 28 Avelo has added five other routes to small and mid-sized airports in the western U.S. They have also established their first east coast base at New Haven Airport in Connecticut.

Currently their in-flight service includes free bottled water and a light snack while other beverages and snacks are offered for purchase.

“One of the advantages of being a smaller new airline is that our cost structures are inherently lower and we’re able to pass those savings on to our customers. Our low everyday fares include no change fees or call center fees for customers who choose to make reservations by phone unbundled travel-enhancing options at industry-low prices that give customers the flexibility to pay for what they value whether that’s priority boarding ($10) a checked bag ($10) or pre-reserved window or aisle seats (starting at $5) – and eventually in-flight internet” Stennes said.

Stennes brings to Avelo an understanding of how to make an in-flight connectivity business model work for a low-cost carrier. She retired from her position as JetBlue’s first-ever vice president of in-flight experience in 2014 a year after the airline introduced IFC on its first aircraft in December 2013.

Avelo’s Boeing 737s feature 189 seats in a single-class layout. At the moment the only onboard offerings to passengers are a free bottle of water a snack and other beverages and food available for purchase. Avelo

When they ultimately do introduce a new connectivity service for passengers the focus will remain on providing more engagement for passenger mobile devices as none of Avelo’s aircraft feature seatback IFC screens.

“Most customers bring their content on the plane and they bring their own screen their phone or other devices. Their screen is often a lot more technologically advanced and reliable than others. So to save money that we can pass on to our customers it is not our intention to invest in old seat back technology but to focus on providing a superior Wi-Fi offering for customers who value it in-flight” Stennes said.

The service that Avelo eventually invests in will also have to compete with in-flight internet offered by other low-cost and non-low cost carriers alike.

“The new next-generation Wi-Fi technology we’re aiming to roll out will eliminate a lot of the frustrations that customers experience today on airlines equipped with old technology allowing for a more enjoyable in-flight experience for our customers” Stennes said.

The next immediate technology-related investment though will come in the form of a new mobile app for Avelo passengers.

“We plan to launch our app soon – giving Customers even more flexibility with how and where they book. We know that mobile booking is a priority for many of our Customers and an app will be key to helping them manage their journey. Launching our app will continue to give our customers an easier and smoother travel experience – from booking a trip from the convenience of their phone to planning their arrival at some of the best airports in the country” Stennes said.

Other low-cost carriers express different opinions about the value of providing passengers with airborne access to the internet. Minnesota-based Sun Country Airlines for example was a low-cost leisure carrier before the impact of COVID-19 caused passenger demand for leisure travel to increase.

With popular routes going from Minnesota to several vacation destinations including Aruba Honolulu Turks & Caicos and St. Thomas among others Sun Country’s leadership has not seen an overwhelming demand for in-flight connectivity from leisure travelers.

“Many of our customers are leisure travelers – they want to stay entertained in-flight but don’t necessarily need to check email or work on a shared spreadsheet. Rather than charge our guests for Wi-Fi we offer complimentary onboard entertainment options passengers can enjoy on their own personal devices as well as in-seat power to keep them charged throughout the flight” Brian Davis chief marketing officer for Sun Country Airlines wrote in an emailed statement.

Sun Country Airlines’ fleet of 737s feature no in-flight Internet although the Minnesota-based carrier hasn’t completely ruled out a connectivity investment in the future. Sun Country Airlines

Although Sun Country passengers cannot stream or use mobile applications that require an internet connection the airline has made another type of streaming available to them thanks to their 2018 selection of AirFi to supply wireless in-flight entertainment to every seat across all of their Boeing 737s.

AirFi the Netherlands-based wireless IFC supplier provided Sun Country with its 2-kilogram AirFi Box with an embedded server ARM processor and mass storage device that run off aircraft power and alternatively an internal battery to autonomously deliver wireless IFC content to passenger mobile devices.

Davis said the AirFi solution is more than enough IFC for their leisure passengers.

“In 2017 we began a significant transformation spending a great deal of time assessing the onboard passenger experience. Part of this exciting change included introducing complimentary IFC inviting passengers to connect to AirFi to stream a unique library of popular movies television shows games music and more. For a while we experimented with in-flight tablets but found they required more maintenance and most folks prefer to bring their own tech onboard like smartphones tablets or laptops” Davis said.

Along with the wireless IFC investment Sun Country also equipped each of its seas with USB ports and power outlets. The 2017 transformation also included an increase to the seat pitch on their aircraft which currently sits at 29-34 inches for the 737-800 and 36-38 inches for the 737-700 compared to the industry average range of 29 to 32 inches.

Davis said Sun Country has not completely ruled out a possible IFC investment in the future.

“We are constantly evaluating our customer experience but we believe we offer our guests a really comfortable product at a price point that stimulates leisure travel. We are focused on keeping transferrable costs down while meeting the needs of our customers. Our current onboard digital experience fulfills this. We are able to offer an enhanced onboard experience while keeping fare prices down for folks who fly with us. We will continue to evaluate the option of adding Wi-Fi in the future but at this time we’re happy with our current onboard entertainment options” Davis said.

Sun Country’s 737s also feature no seatback IFE screens. Sun Country Airlines

As the most glaring example Europe’s two largest low-cost carriers Easyjet and Ryanair have never featured in-flight Internet access and still in 2021 have announced no plans for consideration of adopting connectivity. In the U.S. by contrast the two most recognizable low-cost carriers JetBlue and Southwest have both offered tiered access to in-flight Internet for more than five years.

The perspectives on investing in IFC expressed by Stennes and Davis are reflective of a global trend among low-cost carriers.

According to a September 2020 report published by Euroconsult there were approximately 9200 aircraft equipped with IFC globally at the end of 2019 and despite the impact of COVID-19 the firm expects that number to grow to between 15000 and 18000 by 2029. Xavier Lansel a senior consultant for Euroconsult told Avionics that it is difficult to estimate how many of those newly connected aircraft will be operated by low-cost carriers.

“We can definitely observe an increased adoption of IFC by LCC but with regional disparities” Lansel said in an emailed statement. “The Asia-Pacific region is dominated by LCCs and some of the major ones like Air Asia are driving the adoption. North America where IFC is more common than anywhere in the world is seeing an increasing adoption by LCCs for instance Southwest Airlines JetBlue and Spirit Airlines. In this region some connected LCCs like JetBlue are paving the way towards free IFC. Europe is lagging behind as few LCC currently offer IFC.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAzNzgzODIwMjEwMDE1MzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Study of defluidization of iron- and manganese-based oxygen carriers under highly reducing conditions in a lab-scale ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378382021001533 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAzNzgzODIwMjEwMDE1MzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHRpbWVzLmNuL3BhZ2UvMjAyMTA1LzEyMjI5MzUuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China's rocket debris falls to Earth as 'accurately predicted',"Photo:Xinhua

China's space authority announced on Sunday that remnants from China's Long March-5B Y2 carrier rocket reentered the Earth's atmosphere most of it burning up on entry with some remnants falling in the Arabian Sea. Amid an intense China-US relationship and increasingly fierce competition in technology between the two great powers some Americans have been racking their brains and grasping every chance to hype the ""China threat"" theory with the latest episode being they accusing China of being ""irresponsible"" for leaving rocket debris ""uncontrolled causing threats to objects on Earth"" despite the fact that it is a global common way to deal with rocket debris practiced by all space powers including the US itself.Chinese aerospace experts mocked that they felt ""surprised"" that some people would buy such absurd logic as it is common sense in the science field. Analysts of foreign affairs pointed out that it reflects the double standards of the West in an attempt to sabotage China's space station construction plan exposing their military intentions to track China's space hardware.Debris from China's Long March-5B Y2 carrier rocket reentered Earth's atmosphere at 10:24 am Beijing time on Sunday with most parts burning up during the process China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) said. The location of the re-entry is 72.47 degrees east longitude and 2.65 degrees north latitude indicating somewhere on the Arabian Sea west of the Maldives.Despite clarification by China's space industry insiders and Foreign Ministry that the probability of the rocket remnants causing harm was extremely low a number of Western media outlets including CNN and The New York Times as well as the US' Pentagon and NASA claimed the debris was heading back to Earth in an ""uncontrolled"" manner and criticized China of being ""irresponsible"" for the ocean landing.""The accusations were false groundless"" said Song Zhongping an aerospace expert and TV commentator. ""The so-called 'uncontrolled' trajectory refers to the loss of propulsion but in no way means that China has lost track of its flight path and real-time location.""Every movement of the rocket fragments is being closely watched by China's space tracking network and accurate predictions on its landing site were made accordingly and the flight course would avoid densely inhabited areas in the designing phase Song told the Global Times on Sunday.Wang Ya'nan chief editor of Aerospace Knowledge magazine said it is ""completely normal"" for rocket debris to return to Earth and it is a common practice carried out by all global participants in the aerospace field including the US.""The wreckage's fall is within the normal range under widely accepted standards with most parts burnt up during re-entry and a few were insufficiently burnt due to differences in the atmospheric environment"" Wang said.""Except for the SpaceX reusable rockets all remnants from the first and second stages of traditional launch vehicles return to Earth in an uncontrolled manner. And all countries conducting such practice track the falling pieces and calculate their trajectories as China does"" Wang noted.The Tianhe space station core module's successful delivery to orbit has proven the reliability and controllability of the Long March 5B rocket Wang added.Following the successful launch of the Long March-5B Y2 which sent the first section of China's space station - Tianhe core module cabin - into orbit China kicked off an intense construction phase of the country's first space station project where a busy schedule of another 10 launches has been set for the next two years. The space station is expected to be operational by 2022.Estimated to be the only operational space station in orbit that will be open to foreign partners after the retirement of the International Space Station scheduled in 2024 some Western countries especially the US are jealous of how rapidly China is growing in aerospace technology. ""Therefore any progress in the aerospace sector will touch a nerve in the US strategic community"" Li Haidong a professor at the Institute of International Relations at China Foreign Affairs University told the Global Times on Sunday.The US has continued suppressing China on science and technology field after US President Joe Biden took office. It tried to use the issue of the rocket debris to smear China's image in the globe accusing the country of damaging world peace and on the other hand it attempted to play up the ""China threat"" theory as not every country can develop Long March rockets Li said.Space debris is an issue faced by all countries in the process of space development. Space needs protection from all countries just like Earth. However it is a scientific and technological issue and should not be politicized Li stressed.Several Chinese space industry insiders reached by the Global Times on Sunday revealed that China did its homework during the initial rocket design phase on the liftoff position trajectory planning and related technical preparations which all took into consideration the falling of rocket debris.Before the debris reentered the Earth's atmosphere the US military and certain EU agencies closely tracked the debris and predicted the landing time and location. Experts noted that Western predictive analysis of the wreckage of the final stage of the Long March-5B Y2 carrier rocket is a kind of anti-missile training for them.""Although the upper stage of this rocket is not a real missile the prediction of its flight trajectory and reentry performance parameters can be used as an exercise to predict the reentry parameters of a real missile warhead. It is a reference for their future precise anti-missile operations"" said Huang Zhicheng an expert in the space industry.Huang noted that the treatment of rocket debris around the world is basically at the same level. The main problem is that the debris of the upper stage of the rocket may cause a small amount of debris but the probability of causing harm is very small. However this problem has not been finally solved by any country.In stark contrast to media reports on China's rocket debris burning rocket remnants of the second stage of the US SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket which crashed on a farm in Washington state in March were described by media like Associated Press as ""leaving comet-like trails"" as the vessel streaked across the Pacific Northwest sky.The different descriptions of the two rockets reflects the double standards adopted by some Western forces in the way China is treated said Song as ""they are not really worried about causing harm to people but since it's a Chinese rocket they have politicized the matter put a label on it and then hyped it.""Xing Jianwei vice chief designer of the Long March 2C carrier rocket told media that China is developing the capability to control the rocket's fairing (when the nose cone that protects the payload is jettisoned in space) after separation so that the attitude of its re-entry to Earth can be controlled.During the nearly 60 years of space activity no case of rocket debris causing human casualties has been reported. The risks for all rocket debris are fairly close hence it is seriously anti-intellectual to claim that Chinese rockets have a particularly high risk analysts said.""I now really doubt the common sense of science in Western society since they believe in such logic"" Wang Yanan noted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb2dpc3RpY3NtaWRkbGVlYXN0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8zNzI1NC1hdGxhbnRpYy1jb250YWluZXItbGluZS1pcy1lbmhhbmNpbmctcmVmcmlnZXJhdGVkLW9wZXJhdGlvbnMtd2l0aC1jYXJyaWVyLXRyYW5zaWNvbGQtcHJpbWVsaW5lLXVuaXRzLWFuZC1seW54LWZsZWV00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Atlantic Container Line is enhancing refrigerated operations with Carrier Transicold PrimeLINE Units and Lynx Fleet ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.logisticsmiddleeast.com/business/37254-atlantic-container-line-is-enhancing-refrigerated-operations-with-carrier-transicold-primeline-units-and-lynx-fleet on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb2dpc3RpY3NtaWRkbGVlYXN0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8zNzI1NC1hdGxhbnRpYy1jb250YWluZXItbGluZS1pcy1lbmhhbmNpbmctcmVmcmlnZXJhdGVkLW9wZXJhdGlvbnMtd2l0aC1jYXJyaWVyLXRyYW5zaWNvbGQtcHJpbWVsaW5lLXVuaXRzLWFuZC1seW54LWZsZWV00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9mbHllZ3lwdC1uZWVkLXRvLWtub3cv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Egyptian Low-Cost Carrier flyEgypt: What You Need To Know,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9mbHllZ3lwdC1uZWVkLXRvLWtub3cv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Situated in the heart of Hosur Therpet Lake serves as both an important source of water and gathering place for the community. But the 7.5-acre body of water — about the size of 4 soccer fields — had never been cleaned and was drying up at an alarming rate. What water remained was filled with untreated waste high in nitrate and phosphate content and overrun with algae and water hyacinths.

Left in this condition it was only a matter of time before Therpet Lake would die shrinking groundwater levels and hampering Hosur’s ability to fight drought — an unacceptable outcome in this water-scarce area.

That led The People Society of Hosur to approach the Industrial Power Systems Division (IPSD) Hosur team part of Caterpillar India Pvt Ltd (CIPL). Members of the group had heard about CIPL’s commitment to increasing access to clean water sanitation and hygiene and asked the company to lead the reclamation efforts.

A community commitment to clean water

With support from the United Way as well as local and state governments the IPSD Hosur team guided the community in transforming Therpet Lake from a dirty dying body of water to a thriving self-sustaining water source. The two-year project involved:

Pumping out 8 million gallons (30 million liters) of sewage water

Permanently diverting sewage water to avoid future encroachment

Removing 22 tons (20 metric tons) of water hyacinths and 5730 tons (5200 metric tons) of solid waste

Strengthening tank bunds small barriers that discourage runoff

Clearing clogged entry and exit points

Adding stone pitching on the shore to prevent erosion

To enhance residents’ enjoyment of the lake — and to encourage them to help sustain this revitalized water source for the future — the team also installed a new pathway with lights and benches planted trees and created an island.

Today Therpet Lake’s water-holding capacity has risen to 16 million gallons (61 million liters) — enough to recharge the groundwater and supply water for local families. The project was replicated on three nearby lakes and the IPSD Hosur team received recognition from the government of Tamil Nadu for their efforts in “restoring the original glory of four water bodies in and around Hosur.”

The Indiana Department of Natural Resources says that weather permitting it will begin spraying during the week of May 10 to kill gypsy moth caterpillars in selected areas of Allen Miami and Wells counties.

That spraying will release particles containing a type of bacteria that's deadly to the moth's caterpillar-like larvae.

Earlier this year Gardeners’ World presenter Monty Don shared photos on his Instagram account showing how his box hedges had been “ravaged” by box blight. Box blight is a devastating fungus which causes leaves to turn brown and the growing tips to shrivel. To ensure the disease had been completely eradicated Monty said he “grubbed and burnt” the hedges.

They appear because female box moths lay their eggs on the underside of box leaves. Once these hatch the caterpillars rapidly feed on leaves which can cause “almost complete defoliation” of the plant. Nick branded the caterpillar “one of the top garden pests in the UK”. The horticultural pro spoke to fellow gardener Rosie Fyles who has been battling the pest. The expert explained what the main signs are for box tree caterpillar. She said: “What you see here is leaves that have been eaten and then some webbing. Where there is webbing the caterpillar tends to be hiding in leaves.”

READ MORE Gardening expert shares warning over buying basil in the supermarket Rosie said you can pick off the caterpillars individually but you have to spot them first. Box caterpillars usually appear in May but according to Rosie it can depend on the weather. Instead of controlling the problem Rosie is planning to replace the box hedging in Ham House’s kitchen garden. In other areas once the caterpillars are spotted they are targeted using a biological spray. Chris Poole the chairman of the European Boxwood and Topiary Society and his team have been testing out unique new ways to tackle the problem. They were contacted by a German company who have a deterrent which could stop the female moths laying their eggs. In gas permeable pouches Chris and his team put caterpillar excrement into the hedge. Another more simple solution is using the herb thyme.

Chiefs at the Forestry Commission have called on members of the public to be “on their guard” against oak processionary moths (OPM) which are highly toxic in their caterpillar stage.

3 Hairs on the caterpillars - which feed off oak trees - contain toxins called thamentopoein which can cause severe skin rashes

The toxic critters invaded the UK in 2006 after oak trees were imported from Holland - and were later found in London parks before spreading to surrounding counties.

Now the pests have been found as far north as Inverness in Scotland and as far west as Glamorganshire in Wales.

Hairs on the caterpillars - which feed off oak trees - contain toxins called thamentopoein which can cause severe skin rashes and asthma attacks.

The hairs can also cause eye and throat irritations vomiting dizziness and fever.

Each creature contain 63000 hairs - and experts have warned you don’t even need to be in direct contact with the bug to be affected as they can be carried in the wind.

A spokesman for The Forestry Commission issued a warning to Brits this week stating: “The Forestry Commission urges the public to report sightings of oak processionary moth (OPM) caterpillars.

“The greatest risk period is May to July when the caterpillars emerge and feed before turning into adult moths. The pest is established in London and surrounding areas.

“The Forestry Commission runs an annual programme in place to tackle OPM and works with partners to monitor treat and research the pest in order to slow the spread and reduce the intensity of the pest.”

What are oak processionary moths? Oak processionary moths are dark in colour and around 25mm in length.

The caterpillars which later turns into a moth are covered in long white hairs.

The barbed hairs have a protein in them which causes irritation they can often get caught in breezes and land on people's skin.

Experts warn that if they get in contact with human skin they cause cause itchy rashes eye problems and sore throats.

Andy Hall Forestry Commission Operations Manager said: “At this time of year many people are enjoying green spaces and it’s really important for the public to be aware of the risk of tree pests like oak processionary moth.”

He said that Brits should “report any sightings” using it TreeAlert website or to contact them directly adding: “This will help us with our programme of treatment and enables us to slow the spread of this pest.”

Trish Mannes Deputy Director for Health Protection for Public Health England South East said Brits should ‘keep away’ from the caterpillars adding: “We strongly advise people not to touch or approach the caterpillars or their nests because of the health risks posed by the hairs.

“Pets and livestock can also be affected and should be kept away as well.

“People should see a pharmacist for relief from milder skin or eye irritations following possible OPM contact or consult a GP or NHS111 for more-serious reactions.”

She said that a government-backed programme - which has cost £37m in the past nine years - was in place to “limit their spread from areas where they are present”.

A spokesman for the National Trust urged Brits not to touch the fluffy critters and to keep dogs on a lead to avoid contact with the bugs."

The 10-year lease is for a Sares Regis Group property measuring roughly 87500 square feet at 3550 Carson St.



Lee and Associates’ Doug Marshall and Ian Ameche represented Morf3D in the lease. CBRE Group Inc.’s John Schumacher and Bret Quinlan represented Sares Regis.



Morf3D already occupies a 13000-square-foot space in El Segundo but needed to expand.



“We put them in El Segundo five or six years ago next to Boeing” Ameche said. “They were limited by the space on the amount of printers they could have. The reason for this space is they can stack 50 or 60 of the printers that are very expensive and really uptick the manufacturing capability of the company.”



Ameche said that for now the company will retain its El Segundo office “but their plans with that space remain to be seen. There’s going to be some overlap with the build-out time for their new space.”



Beyond the size of the Long Beach space he said the area was appealing for a few other reasons.



First Ameche said rents in the area are less expensive than in some other industrial markets. The building is also part of Pacific Pointe a large master-planned development.



The building “is a brand-new turnkey facility” according to Ameche who said there are other tenants in the same industry in the surrounding buildings which is a huge plus.

In fact according to a report issued by the CBRE Group Inc. during 2020 Ulster County saw the second-highest growth in the state behind only the Hudson metropolitan statistical area in Columbia County.

The firm analyzed data from 29 million address changes filed with the U.S. Postal Service to reach its conclusions.

According to its findings 3411 people moved into Ulster County from the New York metropolitan area – primarily Manhattan and Brooklyn – in 2020 a 124.4 percent jump from the 1520 people who moved up from the city in 2019.

In a reversal from historic trends that have seen younger people gravitate toward urban centers the report found the majority of those leaving urban areas like New York City during the pandemic were young well-educated childless adults who had the ability to work remotely.

“What you’re seeing in Ulster County right now is part of a greater trend” said Matthew Mowell a senior economist with CBRE. He said the same migration patterns occurring in Ulster County are also happening elsewhere in the country including places like the Napa Valley and Lake Tahoe in California.

“People are being drawn to these really attractive rural settings” Mowell said. “Ulster County certainly ticks a lot of boxes.”

Most of the people fleeing the city for the countryside are moving only a few hours away explaining the influx of people into Ulster and Columbia counties.

Mowell said that may also suggest that for many the moves aren’t necessarily intended to be permanent. “A lot of the zip codes in the urban centers have a high proportion of young and single people. Those people are quite likely to have this rubber band effect of moving back when the pandemic ends.”

Ulster County Executive Pat Ryan said he believes the new arrivals are a mix of people moving to the area and those who already owned second homes there choosing to make it their permanent home.

“We don’t know the exact breakout of that yet” he said “so I don’t have any further detail but knowing the town-by-town dynamics we know many of our towns had a pretty significant second home population.”

Ryan said the influx of new residents is likely responsible to some extent for the spike in enrollments in the Kingston school district as well as an overall increase in the county’s sales tax revenues. But he added the pandemic and the migration out of New York City have exacerbated the county’s housing crisis.

“There’s no doubt that the price increases in housing are definitely driven by a mismatch of supply and demand. Prices are obviously up significantly” Ryan said. “I definitely think it’s fair to say that COVID overall the number of people who lost jobs or their income plus the new people who are coming is definitely exacerbating the housing problem.”

The county recently completed a housing study that showed in part that nearly one-third of homeowners and half of the county’s renters are living in housing that is unaffordable to them and that a significant portion of county residents spends more than 50% of their income on housing.

“I don’t necessarily think it’s going to get better before it gets worse” Mowell said. “Unless we can expanse the housing stock in a serious way I don’t think we’re going to see a lot of relief in terms of housing prices.”

Ryan has made the creation of affordable and workforce housing a priority of his administration. The county is now in the process of working with a developer to convert the site of the former county jail into a workforce and senior housing complex and county leaders are looking to identify other sites for similar development.

The expanding plaza has at least a few vacant areas and room for growth as discussions continue with retailers. A map posted March 12 on the CBRE Retail real estate page showed a vacant spot next to where Dick’s Sporting Goods will move is “proposed” to Maurice’s which is currently a women’s clothing store at the mall. The location would be next to Five Below.

The March map was taken off the website several days ago and was replaced with a map dated May 3 which does not mention Maurice's.

An employee at Maurice’s at Lycoming Mall said she was not aware of discussions to move to Lycoming Crossing. However Maurice's corporate is pushing for stores to leave mall locations according to an employee.

At the other end of the plaza is the vacant former Gap Factory store which closed in July and is now vacant. The most recent CBRE map shows that the Shoe Dept. another current Lycoming Mall tenant is proposed to go in that space. An employee at the Shoe Dept. said he was not aware of any plans to move.

The map also shows a lease is being negotiated with Marshalls to go into the former Bed Bath & Beyond store. Katie Babb spokeswoman for Marshalls said Marshalls has not announced a store opening in Muncy at this time.

In addition the latest map also shows that a lease is being negotiated with Bath & Body Works another mall store.

A Starbucks near the plaza's south entrance also is shown on the map. The Lycoming County Planning Commission approved plans to build the Starbucks at the March 18 meeting. A lease has not been signed yet. The possibility of having a Chick-fil-A restaurant on the property also was discussed at the meeting but those plans are currently on hold.

Neither CBRE nor Vision Group Ventures Lycoming Crossing's current property and asset manager would comment on plans.

Construction of Dick's Sporting Goods began in March and is coming along as the store is expected to move out of the Lycoming Mall location by September.

Old Navy moved out of the Lycoming Mall in March and into a space formerly occupied by Dressbarn and Cato's. Since the move the store has expanded their hours on week days to 9 p.m.

The Lycoming Mall has about 25 stores left including junior anchor Burlington Coat Factory Books-A-Million and several smaller stores and restaurants.

The six-building complex is home to 4.3 million square feet of offices that account for the lion’s share of Mack-Cali’s total 6.8 million square-foot portfolio. Most are in the interlocked buildings known as Harborside 1 2 and 3.

Previously associated with back-office space they’re nearing completion of more than $100 million in improvements aimed at drawing a more diverse tenant roster for headquarters use and better integrating the commercial buildings into the thriving Jersey City community around them.

“We’ll be much more proactive in pursuing tenants from Manhattan” said senior vice president of leasing Ed Guiltinan. Realty Check readers long knew him as top leasing honcho of Rockefeller Group where he played a key role in repositioning that firm’s Sixth Avenue towers including the former Time + Life Building.

Guiltinan was recruited to Mack-Cali last October as part of the publicly traded developer’s full-court press to revitalize and re-tenant Harborside. About 40 percent of its office space is currently available. However the figure is misleadingly high since it includes 420000 square feet at Harborside 1 which was kept mostly vacant as it underwent a sea-change in improvements. Also on board are crack CBRE leasing teams including a Manhattan group headed by regional CEO Mary Ann Tighe.

Mack-Cali took the Harborside plunge in 1996 when it bought buildings 1 2 and 3 -– 1920s structures that were the Pennsylvania Railroad’s New York terminus prior to the construction of Penn Station in Manhattan.

Although functional the complex soon became dated as newer properties offered better amenities and more sophisticated infrastructure. Friends who worked at Harborside years ago recalled a joyless “nowhere” atmosphere lacking in shopping eating and service options.

Mack-Cali started a “cool factor” turnaround about four years ago. In 2019 it installed a high-quality District Kitchen food hall in Harborside 3. It added attractive artwork throughout the complex upgraded lobbies and created new pedestrian corridors. Lounges were given the industrial-aesthetic treatment in homage to the area’s past.

A 1980s-vintage glass-roof atrium between buildings 2 and 3 is being warmed up with new seating. A big Whole Foods store –- which is also an office tenant -– will open soon at a different building at the site.

The redevelopment of Harborside 1 which will open to tenants by year’s end is the icing on the cake. The eight-story building has a new facade a redesigned lobby with direct access to indoor retail chosen to support Harborside tenants and a fourth-floor tenants’ terrace with views of Manhattan and the river. The building aims to achieve LEED-Gold certification for new energy-conserving mechanicals.

Guiltinan said Harborside 1’s 65000-square-foot floor plates high ceilings and open views should appeal especially to media and creative tenants in contrast to the more traditional corporate appeal of 1-million square-foot Harborside 5 to the west.

CBRE’s Tighe said the repositioning “is designed to meet this moment. The virtually column-free large floors” and “waterfront-facing light-filled spaces” accommodate a broad range of uses.” Current Harborside tenants include Omnicom Whole Foods’ regional offices E*Trade Brown Brothers Harriman and Arch Insurance. Asking rents are in the low $40s to low $50s per square foot Guiltinan said.

Meanwhile Mack-Cali is making Harborside more welcoming to local residents as well as to tenants. (The company also owns apartment buildings adjacent to the office sites). Brooklyn-born open-air food market Smorgasburg will open this summer at a parking lot site. The eastern side of Hudson Street which runs parallel to the office buildings is being turned into a pedestrian plaza with seating a beer garden and what Guiltinan called “fun things” starting in June.

Great Performances founder Liz Neumark shows off the kitchen of her new Bruckner Building headquarters.

We reported in January 2019 that premier caterer Great Performances –- which serves the Plaza Hotel grand ballroom and Jazz at Lincoln Center -– was moving from Hudson Square to a much larger facility in the Bronx. The 41000-square-foot commitment later swelled to 51000 square feet. And last week after a $7.7 million buildout owner Liz Neumark and state and city officials cut the ribbon on the new home in the redeveloped Bruckner Building a former factory at 2417 Third Ave.

The facility includes a state-of-the-art 19000-square-foot kitchen three times larger than the original as well as a warehouse offices training space and the nonprofit Sylvia Center for educating kids in the connection between food and health.

“It’s an exciting new chapter in our 40-year history” Neumark said that expresses optimism “in our future that of the Bronx and of the city’s hospitality sector as a whole” in the pandemic’s wake."

Which academic or extracurricular achievement are you most proud of during business school? I am most proud of the work that I have done to push diversity and inclusion forward across not only the entire Foster MBA program (including students faculty and staff) but also the University of Washington and the broader Seattle community.

I am part of the first Consortium cohort at Foster and coming into the program I knew it would be challenging to be ‘the first’. My parents were ‘the first’ to come to America and I am ‘the first’ in my family to go to college in the US and now pursue an MBA. But I also knew that alongside the struggle there was power in being ‘the first’: I broke through the mold and could now pave the way for others. As one of ‘the first’ at Foster I was going to do whatever I could to make the program better for current and future students – especially those with underrepresented identities. I became a trailblazer for diversity and inclusion:

* Students: I created spaces for people from underrepresented identities to come together and elevate their voices. I built a coalition of diversity leaders (who all used to work in silos) and facilitated quarterly meetings for the group. I pushed for the creation of the ‘Diversity Update’ that now kicks-off every Foster Forum (our monthly all-student meetings) and I use that space to highlight campus initiatives and spotlight diversity leaders and their clubs – whether veterans international students and LGBTQ. I challenge my Fritzky leadership cohort to bring intention into their first-year coaching and have become a trusted resource and sounding board for my classmates who are on their learning journey. And finally following the murder of George Floyd I organized a student-only town hall that gave my Black and brown classmates a platform to share their perspectives and experiences. This event was attended by 165 students and had a ripple effect: students were now empowered to take a more active role in building an inclusive experience for each other and not just look to others to do so.

* Faculty: I have been a panelist on several faculty workshops on the importance of inclusive teaching. Within Foster I met with fall core professors and provided them with tangible changes they could incorporate in their respective courses many of which were implemented. And I continue to advocate for changes to curriculum and the data sets and cases used with the end goal that ALL students feel seen in the classroom not just a few.

* Program Office: I advocated for the formal integration of DEI into the MBA Program. Now MBA Orientation includes workshops on community building and identity. After fall quarter students participate in quarterly trainings about microaggressions DEI definitions and allyship. This programming did not exist in my first year at Foster and I am proud to have worked with the Programs Office to institutionalize this change.

Equity work and systemic change take time but I am proud that as one of ‘the first’ at Foster I became a catalyst whose impact will last beyond the MBA. I am proud to know that I am leaving the Foster program better than when I arrived that I have empowered my community to keep inclusion top of mind rather than an afterthought and that I have already seen changes in how my classmates speak up for one another and carry intention into what they do. That is my legacy one that I am extremely proud of and one that I hope ‘the next’ build on.

What achievement are you most proud of in your professional career? I am most proud of Juma’s 25th Anniversary Gala: a fundraising event I led that raised $500K to support Juma’s programming. Fundraising events are already high stakes for nonprofits since they are one of the largest sources of revenue for the year. Additionally Juma was celebrating 25 years of impact major supporters were flying in from around the country to celebrate over 350 guests were expected (100 more people than usual) and for all you football fans out there: the headline speaker was Steve Young (Go Niners!). The gala was critical to our organization and there were a lot of expectations riding on it — and I was responsible for every last detail. I was a team of one and the only staff dedicated to the event full-time so it was a crazy year-long marathon to the finish line. But all in all the event was the most successful event in Juma history. We raised $500K – (1) exceeding our ambitious $350K goal (2) becoming the most money raised at a Juma event ever(!) and (3) setting a new precedent for Juma events moving forward.

Why did you choose this business school? The people. I knew I wanted to go to a school partnered with the Consortium (CGSM) and to be part of a smaller student body. I didn’t want to be just another face in the crowd and valued being in an environment where I could meet all of my classmates and Foster staff and faculty and genuinely know them. I found that and so much more at Foster. A lot of my decisions are guided by intuition and something just felt right when I visited Foster during Welcome Weekend. I just knew that those were my people – people who value community and care about the world. It’s unfortunate that my class will have spent 2/3 of our time in business school physically separated from one another but I am thankful to have gone through this crazy experience alongside them.

Who was your favorite MBA professor? It’s tie between Crystal Farh and Ryan Fehr who teach the core leadership classes. I loved the energy that they both brought to the classroom and their passion for organizational culture and inclusive decision-making. Their courses challenged me to think critically about my life experiences and how they informed who I am my values and how I lead and work with others. I also appreciated that they structured class to give us time to connect with our classmates and those small group discussions have been so invaluable in my growth throughout the MBA.

What was your favorite MBA event or tradition at your business school? I recommend any event that the Foster Creative club puts on such as Foster Idol (talent show) or Foster Connects (open mic night). Don’t get me wrong I love going to tailgates (also Sailgate which is a tailgate on a boat) with my classmates… but the Foster Creative club creates respectful spaces for classmates to be vulnerable and share what matters most to them – whether it’s by singing their favorite song doing a culturally symbolic dance or storytelling the crucible moments that have shaped who they are today. These events are so special.

Looking back over your MBA experience what is the one thing you’d do differently and why? I wouldn’t change a thing – and let me tell you why. I started business school with two goals: (1) go after the academic and professional opportunities that would push me outside of my comfort zone; and (2) connect with as many classmates as possible despite the social anxiety I would inevitably feel. And I really did put myself out there whether serving on student government or taking challenging classes. But all the while I made sure that every decision I made at business school was because it was something I wanted to do — rather than something that I felt like I was expected to.

I definitely felt imposter syndrome particularly as a first year and in trying to navigate an internship search during the start of the pandemic. But all in all those struggles helped me realize my resilience and the impact that I can and did have on the MBA community and the Foster School of Business. Those experiences adversities and decisions led me to who I am today and I am proud of the legacy I am leaving.

What is the biggest myth about your school? Business schools have a bad reputation for being self-serving — i.e. Elon Musk’s comment last year about how MBAs are ruining corporate America. I fundamentally disagree and I think Foster is a great example of that. We genuinely care for each other and for shared learning; we love the outdoors and thereby want to preserve it; and we care about equity and want to leave the world better than how we left it. My full-time class has also grown more comfortable having conversations around inclusion and racial equity. I’m proud to be part of Foster’s Class of 2021 and look forward to seeing the impact they make beyond Foster.

What is one thing you did during the application process that gave you an edge at the school you chose? I met as many people as possible so that I could get a better sense of the school and its culture whether it was through admissions conferences or chatting with current students and alumni. The MBA program is only two years — and my personal opinion is that the journey will be a lot more fun if you like the other people along with you for the ride. It also helped me hone in on my ‘Why Foster’. I could speak to the school’s culture and values and how they aligned with mine.

Which MBA classmate do you most admire? Preeyel Dalal. She has become one of my rocks in this program. We were both nonprofit fundraisers prior to Foster and share similar life experiences and values. She is one of the hardest-working people I know and I love that she stays true to herself even when the churn of business school might pressure you otherwise. She’s positive and always up for the challenge and is doing incredible work as UW’s Social Entrepreneurship Fellow to make financial institutions more inclusive and accessible to entrepreneurs of color (a cause I am also passionate about). Alongside that work she is the co-President of Women in Business co-runs the Net Impact Service Corps program and all in all is an incredible human being and mother to the sweetest 3-year-old boy.

How disruptive was it to shift to an online or hybrid environment after COVID hit? The abrupt shift to virtual was not fun. Neither students nor faculty and staff knew how to navigate online learning and we all had to adjust to this new normal and its pain points together. We had to navigate Zoom fatigue and synchronous and asynchronous learning as well as learn how to set boundaries between our school and non-school lives. My laptop was also not a fan of all of the time on Zoom: my computer fan broke and I had to send my laptop to the repair shop for three weeks! I’m sad that the virtual environment has meant that my classmates and I were not able to study abroad – something I was personally excited to do – but I’d like to think that once this pandemic subsides we’ll plan some post-graduation activities together to make up for the time lost.

Who most influenced your decision to pursue business? It’s too difficult for me to pick one person so I’ll say this: I am at business school because of Juma. The leadership team taught me about the double- and triple- bottom line and the different types of businesses (i.e. social enterprises and B-corps). Juma’s board made me curious about ways to enact change beyond working at a 501c3. Corporate volunteers exposed me to CSR and corporate philanthropy. Juma staff taught me to be scrappy and resourceful all the while keeping impact at the forefront. And finally the young people in Juma’s program reminded me time and time again about what really matters: that all people deserve an opportunity to reach their highest potential and businesses have the ability to help transform the communities in which they operate. I pursued an MBA to reach my highest potential and in turn use what I’ve learned to make the greatest impact I can and challenge others to do the same.

What are the top two items on your professional bucket list?

(1) Work and live in another country

(2) Speak at a conference in front of my peers and be seen as an industry leader

What made Kelly such an invaluable addition to the Class of 2021?

“Kelly’s passionate people-centered approach to leadership has made her not only a well-respected classmate but also an active change-maker here at Foster. In her role as VP of Diversity she has spent hours deeply listening to the concerns of her peers and organizing opportunities for all members of the community to share listen & learn. In May of 2020 Kelly (in the span of a few days) organized a large MBA town hall meeting in an effort to address the long-time racialized injustices that were now bubbling up into the general consciousness of the country. In typical Kelly fashion storytelling was a strategy she employed to build not only awareness but connective tissue between her classmates. She used this platform to amplify and center voices that had often been silenced or relegated to the margins. After the event many of her peers commented that that was one of the most powerful moments of their MBA experience thus far.”

Melissa Uyesugi

Associate Director Diversity & Inclusion

“Kelly Yu has made an outsized impact on the Foster community and she embodies the characteristics of modern effective leadership; she is empathetic courageous dedicated and values-driven. She brings to Foster a rich history of social advocacy and activism and has used her skills to create a more inclusive community in big and small ways from facilitating conversations about the racial unrest in the US to using her position to center the voices of students most deeply impacted by these events to looking for unique ways to create belonging in our virtual environment. In discussing Kelly a fellow Foster MBA student remarked “She is making us all better”—which to me is the most resounding accomplishment of any leader!”

In fact Xcel's earnings included $27 million in commodity trading profits stemming from the storm. The company said its power-trading operations also saved its customers about $190 million during the big freeze which paralyzed major gas producing regions and sent prices skyrocketing. Gas is a major fuel for both home heating and electricity generation.

CenterPoint tallied $2.2 billion in extra gas costs — including about $500 million in Minnesota — while Xcel incurred $965 million with $215 million from Minnesota. Consumers in Minnesota and other states will likely pay those costs adding potentially hundreds of dollars to their annual gas bill.

That's because Minnesota and most other states treat wholesale gas costs as a pass-through to consumers.

""Because the higher natural gas costs are passed through they did not impact this quarter's results"" CenterPoint CEO David Lesar told analysts in a conference call Thursday. ""We are off to a great start for the year so let's check the utility earnings box as being on track.""

With a pass-through utilities don't mark up the price of gas. Consumers benefit from lower prices and are hurt by higher prices. Usually gas price swings basically even out; but not this time leaving many consumers outraged judging from comments filed with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC). Both CenterPoint and Xcel recently reported first-quarter profits that were comfortably higher than Wall Street forecasts.

Houston-based CenterPoint is Minnesota's largest gas utility; it also has gas and electricity operations in several other states particularly Texas which was blasted by the February storm. Minneapolis-based Xcel is Minnesota's second-largest gas provider and its largest electric utility. Minnesota and Colorado are its primary markets and the latter was hit harder by soaring gas costs. Xcel's Texas operations also were hit.

During the first quarter Xcel's electricity income gains were anchored by an $88 million increase in electricity rates and riders — its main source of earnings as a regulated utility.

But in the first quarter Xcel also booked $27 million in net gains from ""proprietary trading"" according to a federal securities filing. Sizable proprietary trading gains — or losses — are unusual for Xcel.

Like all large utilities Xcel hedges against swings in commodity prices a strategy approved by the PUC and one that is primarily aimed at protecting ratepayers. But Xcel also does some in-house or proprietary trading.

A ""small percentage"" of those in-house trading profits flow to customers Xcel said in a statement. Most gains go to shareholders — though shareholders also bear any losses from proprietary trading the company said. The $27 million trading gain came primarily from Xcel's ""structured origination positions"" in electricity trading markets the company said.

Essentially Xcel had electricity generation capacity beyond its customers' needs thus selling excess power as prices rose during the storm which provided profits while also reducing consumers' bills.

CenterPoint does not do proprietary trading but the practice isn't unique to Xcel. ""There are some utilities that have a small trading business though many have sold them off"" said Michael Doyle a stock analyst at Edward Jones.

The big price run-up is rooted in failures in gas-producing regions such as Texas where temperatures plunged and equipment froze. Supply cratered as demand soared.

But the gas-supply plans of utilities in Minnesota and many other states also came up short during the crisis.

The PUC is investigating the gas-price spike which will cost Minnesota consumers around $800 million. The average CenterPoint customer would get hit the hardest paying $354 for storm-related gas costs more than 50% of a typical annual gas bill. The average Xcel gas customer would pay $270.

By law those costs would be recovered from ratepayers over 12 months starting in September. Both companies have asked the PUC to extend that period to 24 months to ease the sticker shock. CenterPoint initially proposed a finance charge of $40 per month for its average Minnesota customer. The Minnesota Attorney General's Office sharply criticized the charge which CenterPoint said is needed to cover its own gas financing costs.

On April 30 the company told the PUC it had lined up financing and that it would cost $50 million less than initially estimated. CenterPoint said that equates to a $4 per-month financing charge for consumers. Xcel has not proposed a financing fee.

BUFFALO N.Y. — Friday was a busy day for City of Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown.

He received his COVID-19 vaccine and announced that the city has opened up a new broadband access survey for residents to fill out.

""I think it's important to know with certainty who has broadband who doesn't who has access who doesn't and to get the community involved in the process of getting broadband that is reliable that is fast throughout the entire city"" Brown said.

As 2 On Your Side previously reported the city used CARES Act funds to hire ECC Technologies to conduct a study of broadband access in the City of Buffalo.

Part of that study was the deployment of this survey that residents are encouraged to fill out.

""Our action will be to figure out potentially how we can use stimulus money to bridge the digital divide to make sure that families that don't have broadband access in the City of Buffalo have it to make sure that it's just not a one-time thing"" Brown said. ""But that on an ongoing basis families and our community are able to access fast reliable internet.

When the pandemic hit thousands of Buffalo Public Schools students were left scrambling for access to computers and broadband. In the fall the Buffalo Bills announced a $500000 gift and partnership with Spectrum to help close the digital gap.

That funding and partnership will expire at the end of the current school year.

2 On Your Side asked Mayor Brown if the development of a municipal broadband network would be on the table if it's determined that it could be feasible based on the survey results.

""We're open to to that we've talked to County Executive Poloncarz and the county about that"" Brown said. ""So we're absolutely open to whatever option to provide broadband access to 100% of our city population.""

While Mayor Brown has expressed support for the Erie Net project in the past this is the first time he's expressed an opinion about a municipal network within the city limits.

Erie Net is what's referred to a middle-mile network. Erie County would deploy fiber on strategic routes and service providers would lease space from the Erie Net fiber lines to then connect to homes often referred to as the last mile.

A municipal system is one in which a local government controls and deploys to the last mile directly and becomes a service provider.

The most successful example and often the model of effective local government is the municipal system in Chattanooga Tennessee.

Charter Communications which operates Spectrum and is the largest provider in the city had no comment when asked about the survey.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Takito Street (2423 N. Lincoln Ave.; http://takitostreet.com/ ) is the third in the Takito line of restaurants (along with Takito Kitchen and Bar Takito)—a string of restaurants offering playful vibes fresh fruit margaritas and Mexican cuisine.

Takito Kitchen offered modern Mexican items such as Three Sisters polenta shrimp ceviche chipotle margaritas and pork-belly tacos. Bar Takito offered similar compelling fare but had its own memorable decor thanks to the omnipresent typewriters—a take on Takito Kitchen’s photographs.

So what does Takito Street offer? Decor-wise there are festive colors and offbeat signs (such as “Education is important. Tacos is importanter”—a probable nod to the fact that the restaurant is a stone’s throw from DePaul University’s Lincoln Park campus).

Food and drink options are pretty similar to the other two spots. Things started very well as my dining companion ordered a pineapple-serrano margarita (a drink that had her saying “Wow” after every sip—because of the serrano’s kick and the cocktail’s strength) while I had a very refreshing strawberry agua fresca. (However in all honesty I chose that drink after being informed the place didn’t serve horchatas—a Mexican restaurant staple.)

Appetizers were similarly impressive. The traditional guacamole is among the best I’ve had—tasty while being simultaneously chunky and creamy. The esquites (roasted corn with butter lime queso fresco and chili powder) had my friend going back for seconds—and thirds. Even the standard chips-and-salsa combo seemed a little elevated thanks to the flavorful and chunky salsa.

However our paths diverged regarding entrees. I thoroughly enjoyed my al pastor tacos with grilled pineapple and morita sauce (that had just the right amount of heat); however my friend wasn’t so thrilled with her crispy-fish tacos saying they weren’t seasoned enough. I also really liked the salmon Veracruz prepared with capers and tomatoes. Dessert ended on a high note with my friend delightedly sipping her abuelita hot chocolate while I had an unconventional-looking tiramisu.

Takito Street is a paean to Mexican street food—one that you’ll enjoy. My only request is that horchatas find their way onto the menu.

Note: COVID-related protocols include servers with masks and there is a face-mask requirement upon entry. Also there are QR-code menus. Some other protocols have been relaxed although the spot is adhering to the current capacity requirements.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9lY29ub215L2pvYnMtcmVwb3J0LWNvc3Rjby13YWxtYXJ0LXBlcmtzLXdvcmtlcnPSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vZWNvbm9teS9qb2JzLXJlcG9ydC1jb3N0Y28td2FsbWFydC1wZXJrcy13b3JrZXJzLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Costco Walmart lead job pay hikes perks to lure workers,"Many states have recently reinstated work search requirements and return-to-work incentive programs to get workers back on the job.

After April’s disappointing jobs report it's evident companies are having trouble filling positions and trying different ways to get Americans back to work and boost the U.S. economy.

US HIRING SHARPLY MISSES EXPECTATIONS IN APRIL WITH JUST 266000 NEW JOBS ADDED

The U.S. economy added just 266000 new jobs in April according to data released Friday by the Labor Department. The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.1%. Economists surveyed by Refinitiv expected employers to add nearly 1 million jobs and the unemployment rate to fall to 5.8%.

But as the economy continues to recover from the devastating effects of the coronavirus pandemic companies are taking initiative and offering benefits such as more pay and added bonuses to get people back to work.

Here are some of the major companies offering return-to-work incentive programs.

(KOLN) - If you are traveling in far northern Sioux County you might want to drive by the Montrose Church which is located on the Oglala National Grassland.

We caught up with Mary Jayne Jordan to talk about some of the memories she had of attending services at the Montrose Church while growing up.

“What I remember is no air conditioning” Jordan said. “I also remember in the summer time the windows were open and you would smell sage in the air. Whenever I smell sage I go right back to Montrose in my mind.”

The Montrose Church can be found on Hat Creek Road and Road 958 in Sioux County.

“The church was built in 1887” Jordan said. “The immigrants who came to that area were mostly all Catholic so they chose to build this church. They wanted to have a gathering place to worship.”

There was a former village named Montrose that was established there for a time. The village no longer exists.

“My dad and his sisters went to school across the road from the church” Jordan said.

Amazingly the structure that still stands today is the one that’s been there since the beginning. It’s never moved or been damaged. A local family now provides funding to keep the building looking good.

“At one point they built a rectory for the priest to stay in” Jordan said. “But again it’s so remote priests are in high demand so we always had a traveling priest. They eventually sold the rectory and it moved north of Ardmore. The church closed in 1973.”

We are told supporters of the church try to hold an honorary mass there once a year.

“My older brother and I were my sister’s godparents in 1968” Jordan said. “She and a cousin of ours were the last two children to be baptized here when it was an active parish in 1968. There have been weddings since then but it’s not been an active parish since 1973.”

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

Companies including Toyota JetBlue and Cigna are still donating thousands of dollars to the lawmakers who voted against Joe Biden's certification as president.

After a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6 to try and prevent Congress from certifying Biden's win many top US companies scrambled to cut ties with the 147 GOP lawmakers who voted against the results.

Dozen of companies including Walmart Amazon Morgan Stanley and AT&T said they would stop giving donations to these specific lawmakers and Hallmark even asked Hawley and Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall to return its donations.

Other companies including Microsoft Deloitte and Goldman Sachs said they would instead pause all political donations to both Republicans and Democrats. Many gave a set timescale for their pause.

A further group of companies said they would review their contribution policies or would take the January 6 events into account when awarding funding.

Jeffrey Sonnenfeld founder of Yale's Chief Executive Leadership Institute told Axios in March the companies that halted political donations are unlikely to lift this ban any time soon. However recent Federal Election Commission filings show that some companies are still giving to these lawmakers.

Color of Change which says it is America's largest racial justice organization and has more than 7 million members is urging these companies to halt the donations.

Jade Ogunnaike senior campaign director at Color of Change told Insider that Trump's presidency ""undermined faith in our democracy.""

She said lawmakers including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley who voted against Biden's certification ""would have been very happy to do anything possible that they could to ensure that Trump remained in the office.""

""You can't forget that these are not congresspeople that we can trust"" Ogunnaike added.

""It's incredibly important that corporations understand that and refuse to back people who were supporting violence in the transfer of power"" she said.

The vast majority of corporations who pledged to stop funding these GOP lawmakers have stayed true to their word — but some companies who made vaguer promises about assessing PAC criteria have restarted donations while others gave money instead to various Republican committees that in turn fund these lawmakers.

Atalia membutuhkan waktu 21 hari untuk pemulihan setelah dinyatakan positif pada 17 April 2021.

""Alhamdulillah Bu Cinta sudah negatif COVID-19 kemarin. Sekarang kami sudah bisa kumpul lagi setelah terhalang semuanya. Saya terharu sekali saat surat cinta (negatif COVID-19) keluar dan langsung memeluk Bu Cinta. Sudah tiga minggu"" kata Kang Emil sapaan Ridwan Kamil Sabtu (8/5).

Atalia menceritakan perjuangannya untuk sembuh dari COVID-19. Awalnya dia memutuskan tes usap pada 17 April 2021 karena kepala terasa pening.

Gejala yang dideritanya tidak berbeda dengan sakit kepada pada umumnya sebab sebelumnya dia kehujanan saat berkegiatan.

""Hari pertama saya kaget. Bingung juga ketularan di mana karena memang saya bertemu banyak sekali orang dan masyarakat. Saat itu saya berharap teman-teman dan orang-orang yang berkontak dengan saya tidak ada satu pun yang tertular"" kata Atalia.

Atalia kemudian berkonsultasi dengan tim dokter dan bersepakat menjalani perawatan dengan isolasi mandiri di Gedung Pakuan.

Selama menjalani isolasi berbagai gejala ia alami sampai akhirnya dinyatakan negatif COVID-19 pada Jumat (7/5).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vaGFycGVyc2JhemFhci5jby5pZC9hcnRpY2xlcy9yZWFkLzUvMjAyMS8xNTE0Ni9zdXJhdC1jaW50YS11bjF0eS1rZXBhZGEteWFuZy10ZXJzYXlhbmfSAWJodHRwczovL2hhcnBlcnNiYXphYXIuY28uaWQvYW1wL2FydGljbGVzL3JlYWQvNS8yMDIxLzE1MTQ2L3N1cmF0LWNpbnRhLXVuMXR5LWtlcGFkYS15YW5nLXRlcnNheWFuZw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Surat Cinta Un1ty Kepada yang Tersayang,"Studio Harper's Bazaar Indonesia hari itu penuh dengan canda tawa. Sudah dari pagi-pagi sekali boyband Indonesia yang tengah diidolakan remaja kini Un1ty bergantian di-grooming oleh penata rias (tentu dengan menerapkan protokol kesehatan ya). Sang leader Farhan dengan santai duduk di sudut ruangan sambil mendengarkan musik. Seolah ia mengalah untuk ""dikerjakan"" terakhir mengingat rambutnya yang selalu ""ekstra"".

Shandy juga sama fokus dengan smartphone sambil sesekali bercanda dengan anggota yang lain. Berbeda dengan Fiki yang terlihat diam tapi sebenarnya gugup. Ya menurut bisikan Fiki kerap tegang jika harus berurusan sendiri di depan kamera. Semua personel Un1ty ini begitu hangat dan ceria mereka selalu menyapa siapa saja yang masuk ke ruangan.

Fajri dan Zweitson paling rajin membuat video via smartphone-nya demi konten. Sedangkan Gilang tertangkap beberapa kali senang bersenandung.

Kalau Fenly dan Ricky tampak selalu memastikan tatanan rambutnya kepada sang stylist Vero Arviana apakah sudah sesuai dengan konsepnya.

8 personel band yang dibentuk 1ID Music ini akhirnya Bazaar satukan di depan kamera. Sehari penuh kami melakukan banyak aktivitas diawali pemotretan kemudian memberikan tantangan atau #BChallenge lewat beberapa permainan sampai akhirnya menuju sesi curhat.

Rupanya sudah hampir dua tahun lamanya yakni sejak debutnya pada 9 Desember 2019 lalu Un1ty tidak dapat berkumpul bersama keluarga. Mereka harus berdiam di base camp untuk melalui segala pelatihan dan promo. Ditambah pandemi Covid-19 yang akhirnya benar-benar membatasi pertemuan mereka bersama keluarga.

Melalui single terbaru mereka yang bertajuk Restu Waktu mereka seakan menumpahkan perasaan rindu. Perasaan yang (mungkin) hanya bisa dituangkan sementara secara virtual seperti salah satu liriknya:

Khusus di Bazaar 8 anggota Un1ty ini menuliskan Love Letter atau ""surat cinta"" yang ditujukan kepada orang-orang tersayang mereka maupun untuk diri sendiri sebagai bentuk penyemangat diri. Ini adalah isi surat yang mereka tulis secara personal tanpa Bazaar ubah sedikit pun:

Hi Papa karena aku sering banget ngobrol sama mama jadi surat kali ini buat papa ya. Papa apa kabar? Semoga sehat selalu ya porsi makannya masih banyak kayak dulu gak? Selalu sayang sama adik-adikku kan? Dan aku yakin papa masih jadi ayah yang punya banyak waktu buat keluarga. Gak kerasa ya waktu berlalu cepet banget sejak pertama aku naik travel menuju ibu kota sampai saat ini sudah 3 tahun kita belum ketemu lagi aku inget banget ongkosnya papa sama mama yang kasih beserta bekal beberapa ratus ribu untuk uang pegangan ditambah modal nekat aku berangkat. Pamit sama mama dipeluk sambil dia bilang semua doa dan harapannya buatku. Sama papa pamitnya cuma salaman sambil bilang hati-hati dengan nada canggung. Walaupun gengsi but I know that u love me so much. Mau cerita sekarang nasibku sudah berubah sedikit Pa selangkah demi selangkah pelan pelan satu persatu cita-cita ku mulai tercapai ibu kota memang tempat yang tepat untuk merealisasikannya satu persatu walaupun pola pikir kita beda walaupun cara kita beda tapi akhirnya aku sampai di titik ini. Mau bilang makasih sebanyak-banyaknya karna sudah jadi ayah yang supportive dengan apa yang ingin aku lakukan dari dulu tanpa papa aku gak akan ngerti apa-apa. Ya walaupun aku tahu kadang papa jengkel dan juga kadang-kadang aku yang jengkel ya namanya juga cowo biasalah hhahah. Sekarang aku rindu pulang dan pengen banget ngobrol panjang lebar sama papa karena sejak aku remaja-sekarang belum pernah kan kita ngobrol yang panjang. Pengen bilang langsung kalo aku sayang juga sama Papa sama kayak sayangku ke mama gak ada bedanya. Pengen ngobrolin banyak hal yang dulu kita belum pernah lakuin karena kesempatan buat pergi jauh-jauh ngejar cita-cita itu banyakkkkk banget tapi gak sebanyak kesempatan buat pulangnya ya karna kerjaan jadwal pandemi dan segala macemnya. Dah pa segitu saja sampe ketemu ya kalo aku pulang nanti jagain mama dan adik adik.

Aku Farhan Helmy Hasan Ali Jawas. Aku mau berterima kasih ke diri sendiri karena sudah berjuang tegar sampai saat ini.



Aku mempunyai pengalaman hidup yang sangat luar biasa dan punya banyak cita-cita terima kasih sudah menjadi Farhan yang sudah melewati banyak hal dalam hidup terima kasih Farhan kamu sudah menjadi pendukung dan teman terbaik buat aku terima kasih kamu sudah sangat sabar dan tenang untuk melewati semua ujian hidup. Dan aku tahu tidak mudah untuk kamu Farhan untuk selalu tersenyum menghadapi hari-hari. Terima kasih Farhan kamu sudah menjadi orang yang terbaik dari yang terbaik. Terima kasih karna tidak pernah menyerah untuk mencoba sesuatu hal yang baru dan selalu semangat. Aku bersyukur banget karena kamu Farhan terlahir sebagai anak pertama dari seorang ibu yang selalu punya kasih sayang lebih untuk membahagiakan aku. Aku tahu hidup itu memang tidak mudah tapi kamu Farhan selalu tegar menjalaninya. Aku sangat bersyukur dan bangga menjadi Farhan yang sekarang di mana ego adalah salah satu hal tersulit untuk aku taklukan and you made it farhan. Terima kasih aku Farhan yang selalu berusaha berpikir positif. Karena aku yakin ketika aku berfikir positif akan membuat kehidupan yang aku jalani akan terasa mudah tanpa merasa terbebani aku bangga sama kamu yang sekarang Farhan liat deh kamu itu sudah membanggakan orang orang yang kamu sayang kamu itu sudah berhasil menjadi cerminan banyak orang sekarang. Ingat semakin kita menaiki tangga kehidupan yang lebih tinggi lagi maka pasti kita akan bertemu dengan problema yang lebih sulit lagi akan bertemu dengan pilihan yang lebih banyak lagi dan tentunya tidak ada yang mudah.



Terima kasih untuk tidak pernah menyerah dengan keadaan terima kasih sudah mau bangkit walaupun rasanya sulit tapi kamu akan lihat bahwa kamu kuat bisa melewatinya. Just don't give up everything its gonna be fine!



Terima kasih Farhan karena kamu kuat dan tidak menyerah di saat cobaan dari tahun ke tahun yang terus datang silih berganti. I love to be me I love you Farhan."

The first case detected in the cluster on May 5 is an 88-year-old Singaporean cleaner who works at Changi Airport Terminal 3. On Saturday three more workers at the airport tested positive - a cleaner a safety coordinator and an aviation officer.



Four new cases at the airport were detected on Sunday - two cleaners a Certis Cisco officer and a SATS passenger escort. All of them work at Changi Airport Terminal 3.

On May 9 his test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection and he was taken to Sengkang General Hospital.

""I'm always hesitant to give advice because it sounds like I did everything right"" Dimon said ""but I assure you I did not.""

To start Dimon told the graduates about the importance of learning from failure.

""All of you have been affected by Covid-19 in different ways. Your future is bright but as you get older it is inevitable that you will face tough times and failure both personally and professionally"" Dimon said. ""How you deal with failure may be the most important thing in whether you succeed.""

Throughout his career Dimon has dealt with obstacles himself — in 1998 he was fired from Citigroup by his own mentor after the pair had worked together for 15 years. But two years later Dimon became CEO of Chicago-based Bank One which was later bought by JPMorgan Chase.

Under his leadership JPMorgan Chase overcame the Great Recession and became the nation's largest bank.

""Learning is a lifelong pursuit"" Dimon said. ""It's your job to constantly learn and it doesn't end now that you're college graduates. Regardless of what you do in life to be successful you need continuous learning and endless intellectual curiosity.""

Lifelong learning is important to Dimon he said adding that he spends ""about 50% of my time reading and learning. It's even more important in today's increasingly complex and rapidly moving world.""

Along with reading Dimon urged students to learn from other people and their actions.

""You can learn more from speaking to someone in 15 minutes than spending your life doing something"" Dimon said. ""I learned a lot about what to do and what not to do by watching other people.""

Dimon received his bachelor's degree from Tufts University in 1978 and his master's degree from Harvard Business School in 1982. He also received an honorary degree from Ohio State University on Sunday.

His current net worth is $1.9 billion according to Forbes.

Special to Foster's

In the past few months several Dover residences of historical and/or architectural significance have come on the market. It might be of interest to track some of the owners or residents over the course of the years.

The first was mentioned in a recent article on the Coffin family being the building at 49 Arch St. one of Dover's earliest homes constructed some time shortly after the 1720s. It was inhabited by Coffins until the mid-19th Century then by a series of owners until the 1930s when Harold Holbrook a vice president at the Strafford National Bank his wife Rachel and two children Robert and Ruth occupied the property. In the 1950s it was the home of George and Miriam O'Neil and two daughters Eleanor and Shirley (the latter is identified as a teacher at Old Orchard Beach). A son Kenneth lived close by on Richmond Street.

George O'Neil was the owner of Kenmore Motors an auto dealership (Oldsmobile as I recall) and garage at 142 Washington St. a former Henry Law property which was located to the rear of what is now the Citizens Bank parking lot with a separate used car location at 519 Central Ave. O'Neil served for a time on the Dover City Council and was a trustee at Wentworth Douglas Hospital. By the mid-'70s the family had added a real estate office at 493 Central Ave. the dealership was gone and Ken O'Neil was now living at 49 Arch where he died in 2003. (He was another honoree from the Dover Sports Hall of Fame having been a standout basketball player for DHS and for many years coach of the basketball program at St. Mary's Academy.) A subsequent resident at the property was Leo J. Rochefort who was employed as a manager at Liberty Mutual.

The next three homes are all on Summer St. and two were constructed on what had been known in the mid-1800s as Ricker's Field. The owner of the land was John Ricker who lived at the corner of Silver and Belknap and it stretched from Silver Street in the north to what became Fisher Street and from Locust to Rutland Street in the west. John was married to Marilla Ricker considerably his junior in age and when he died in 1868 she inherited the property consisting of close to 35 acres quickly selling it to three of Dover's leading citizens - Andrew Young Samuel C. Fisher and Daniel Hall. (The proceeds then allowed her to afford several years of travel in Europe law studies in Washington D.C. and her subsequent career as a women's rights activist.)

Andrew Young's home was the first to be built on the former Ricker property in 1870 and this became 37 Summer St. Young had served as Register of Deeds in the 1850s was Clerk of Court just prior to the start of the Civil War where he rose to the rank of colonel in the Union Quartermasters Corps and afterward became Collector of Internal Revenue for the 1st NH District. In later years he became a director of the Portsmouth & Dover Railroad. In 1891 his widow sold the property to W.W. Hayes who with Eldridge A. Shorey had a dental office in the Strafford Bank Building on Washington Street. In 1903 Hayes sold to George Tolman a medical doctor graduate of both Bowdoin College and their medical school. He served for a number of years as the Deputy County Medical Examiner (he was called in to assist on the Walter Sterling autopsy) and was one of several local physicians who provided services to the Hayes Hospital then conveniently located just westerly of Tolman's house on Summer Street.

By 1917 No. 37 was the home of Fred N. Beckwith manager of Beckwith Box Toe Company on Sixth Street at the location of today's Purdy's Storage. It appears that Beckwith was a serious golfer a member of both the Portsmouth Country Club and the still existing Middlebrook Golf Club located on Sawyer property off Stark Avenue but at the time of his purchase of 37 Summer St. he had enough spare time to serve as mayor for one term. After making substantial improvements and upgrades to the home it was sold to Gerald D'Arcy the owner of the D'Arcy Company on Maple Street producer of windows doors and other wood products. (His son Donald D'Arcy lived for a brief time in an apartment at 5 Elm St. on a lot that had been created from the Beckwith property.) Gerald's widow Edith D'Arcy continued to live there for several years and around 1942 it was purchased by Edwin J. York prominent purveyor of wood coal and grain at 255 Locust St. the location in later years of the Diamond Match (Diamond National) Company lumber and building supply yard. By 1948 the residents were his widow Addie and his daughter Grace Zetterberg also a widow and her children. That family continued to occupy the home through the '70s. In 1980 it was purchased by Kenneth Chadwick and his family.

A third property recently sold (for the rather staggering sum as reported of $2 million) is at 50-52 Summer St. It was originally built in 1890 as a two-family home and after her travels in Europe and her time in Washington D.C. Marilla Ricker returned to Dover and lived at No. 52. She apparently maintained that as her legal residence although for several years prior to her death in 1920 she was to be found living at The Parker House in Boston. At some point No. 50 was turned into four living units and being apartments people came and went but one family Luther G. Ingram his wife Velma and son Luther Jr. remained in place for well over 30 years (Velma for many years as surviving widow). Other relatively long-term tenants were Philip P. and Jessie M. Caswell; he was employed at the NH State Probation office in Dover for many years and following his death Jessie moved next door into No. 52 which was still a single residence.

In 1943 we find Sidney Robbins originator of Robbins Auto Supply living at No. 52. Five years later the space is occupied by Catherine Robbins (widow of Hyman) while Sidney is located at 2 Elm St. Several years later we find Sidney and family living in a newly constructed 41 Summer St. to the left of the Zetterberg house. Thus the very newest house and the very oldest house in the former Ricker's Field became next-door neighbors.

One more house to come.

""I basically came very close to dying"" he says.

Known as ""the most photographed man on Wall Street"" Tuchman has an amazing expressiveness that tells you instantly if stocks are up or down. He contracted COVID-19 early on and has had health issues ever since. Tuchman didn't return to the trading floor full time until November.

Since the stock market reopened its iconic trading floor last May after a temporary closure it has operated with a skeleton crew on-site.

Starting Monday that will change. If 100% of a firm's traders are fully vaccinated it can start sending more of them back to the floor. They will be able to eat lunch in their booths again. Masks will be optional in some parts of the floor.

For Tuchman this is another step forward on the path to normalcy. ""We as the ones who are still left here are significant and relevant and important"" he says.

The exchange is an outlier

The New York Stock Exchange stands out among its rivals. These days most markets don't have trading floors; they are all-electronic. Last week the CME Group announced it won't reopen most of its trading pits in Chicago which it closed during the pandemic.

In 2020 when the New York Stock Exchange decided to send its traders home there was speculation it could portend a permanent change.

""Many of us thought well maybe they'll take the opportunity to get rid of it once and for all"" says Joel Hasbrouck the Kenneth G. Langone professor of business at New York University. ""But they didn't. They brought it back.""

He says there continues to be an argument for having a traditional trading floor. It can make complicated transactions easier and there is a benefit to conducting some negotiations face to face.

Stacey Cunningham the president of the New York Stock Exchange embraces its status as an outlier.

""It's absolutely true that you can run a market without a trading floor"" she says. ""The difference is you get a much better result when you combine people with technology in a well-integrated way.""

And that's the pitch she and her colleagues make to companies that are considering selling stock to the public.

The lure of the iconic bell

Cunningham also likes to play up the institution's long history. The familiar loud ringing of a big bell signals the opening and closing of the day's trading. The New York Stock Exchange's website points out that the ringing of the bell — the ding ding ding played up by TV news — is more than just a colorful tradition that started in the 1870s. It is critical to the orderly functioning of the marketplace assuring that no trades take place before the opening or after the close of the markets.

The sound of the bell was even trademarked with an expert describing it this way:

""The sound of a brass bell tuned to the pitch D but with an overtone of D-sharp struck nine times at a brisk tempo with the final tone allowed to ring until the sound decays naturally. The rhythmic pattern is eight 16th notes and a quarter note; the total duration from the striking of the first tone to the end of the decay on the final one is just over 3 seconds.""

The bell is part of the pomp and ceremony that comes with an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Executives of companies have always crowded onto a small balcony overlooking the trading floor and they'd ring the opening bell on the day their stocks first started trading. These days there are no crowds and executives often appear via video link.

But companies are eager to restart the tradition and Cunningham says she expects the exchange will welcome them back into the building soon.

Cunningham doesn't expect everyone to return immediately and despite the change in rules she believes traders will come back to the building gradually.

""One of the guiding principles that we've had throughout this process was to react to local conditions and increase and ease restrictions as those conditions change"" Cunningham says.

This past weekend Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the positivity rate in New York City has dropped below 1.5% and almost half of New York state's adult population has been fully vaccinated.

KO,Coca-Cola Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vY29jYS1jb2xhLWZhY2VzLXRocmVhdHMtb24tZGl2ZXJzaXR5LWNpdmlsLXJpZ2h0cy1zdGFuY2VzLTIwMjEtNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coca-Cola Faces Threats on Diversity Civil-Rights Stances,"Coca-Cola can't catch a break.

In late March voting-rights activists in Georgia expressed dismay that Coca-Cola and other big Atlanta businesses hadn't come out against their state's new voting law. Now after the company's CEO condemned the law it's in the spotlight for replacing its top lawyer just after he rolled out one of the industry's boldest diversity programs.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Bradley Gayton one of the most prominent Black in-house lawyers in the US joined Coca-Cola from Ford Motor Co. in September. In February he unveiled a policy that required his outside law firms to have 30% of the hours they bill worked by women lawyers from racial or ethnic minorities or lawyers with disabilities. Half of that time would have to be billed by Black lawyers. Failing to meet the goal would mean a 30% fee cut.

Gayton abruptly resigned in April with some speculating that it was because of his aggressive push for diversity — specifically for Black lawyers. Others indicated that his effort to restructure Coke's legal department rubbed some the wrong way.

Regardless of the explanation his successor Monica Howard Douglas has said Coca-Cola is pausing Gayton's diversity policy. Douglas is a Black woman who has been at Coke since 2002.

But the program has already caught the attention of the anti-affirmative-action activist Edward Blum who is well known for backing Abigail Ficher's lawsuit against affirmative action at the University of Texas and Shelby County Alabama in its lawsuit that overturned key parts of the Voting Rights Act. In late April Blum's lawyers wrote a letter to Douglas saying they believed Coca-Cola's outside counsel program was illegal. Blum told Insider that several small law firms are willing to sue Coca-Cola over the policy.

Businesses have been under pressure from investors employees and other stakeholders to go beyond what the law requires when it comes to their impact on the world. BlackRock and other major shareholders have pressured companies to cut carbon emissions. Activists have asked businesses to oppose certain policies like foreign-government censorship or the deportation of undocumented migrants and to do more to elevate Black Hispanic and female workers.

""It's really about this conversation in corporate America"" said Jean Lee who leads the Minority Corporate Counsel Association. ""Does a corporation have a moral voice and should they use that?""

The attack on Coke's diversity effort comes just weeks after the company took heat from more liberal groups urging it to take a stronger stand against an election law backed by Georgia Republicans. The law includes some provisions that Democrats said would disempower minority voters and give the state's legislative Republican majority undue influence over conducting elections.

Now Coca-Cola is being attacked from the right. Blum's lawyers at Boyden Gray & Associates have worked against several corporate racial initiatives including Nasdaq's proposed rule on board diversity. Jonathan Berry a lawyer at the firm said it has also represented Blum's group in opposing a housing-assistance program for Black people that the city of Evanston Illinois called reparations for discrimination.

Wesley Longhofer a professor of organization and management at Emory University Goizueta Business School said Coca-Cola is no stranger to taking stances on racial-justice issues going back to 1964 when it got white Atlantans to turn out for an event in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. He said the company's cachet can make it a focus for activists.

""Social-movement organizations oftentimes will target these iconic brands because they know these brands care about reputation but also just to raise awareness"" he said.

Coca-Cola isn't the first company to set diversity requirements for its outside law firms

There are about a dozen companies whose corporate legal departments have set expectations for the gender and racial composition of the law firms they hire according to the Minority Corporate Counsel Association. HP Novartis Microsoft and Facebook are among those known to do so. It's common for legal departments to take a carrot-and-stick approach; Novartis has threatened to withhold up to 15% of a law firm's fees if it doesn't meet diversity standards and Microsoft will give firms that meet diversity targets up to a 3% bonus on their fees.

Some companies set bars that are arguably higher than Coke's. Facebook spokeswoman Nneka Norville said in a written statement that the company now requires that 50% of the lawyers on its teams be diverse — including women LGBTQ people racial and ethnic minorities and people with disabilities — up from 33% last year. It doesn't impose an hours requirement like Coke but it does require that women and minorities be given more than token assignments. These lawyers are expected ""to serve as a relationship manager make significant contributions in the courtroom or on deals etc."" the spokeswoman said.

No one who spoke to Insider can recall any of those companies facing a potential lawsuit over their diversity programs.

Kim Rivera HP's former chief legal officer said companies investors law firms and stakeholders see the harm that can come from ""a persistent lack of inclusion and equity."" HP said it will hold back 10% of the bill from law firms whose invoices don't reflect that at least 10% of the time was done or overseen by women and minority lawyers.

Rivera said a small portion of law firms shared negative feedback but added that feedback was motivated by a misunderstanding of what HP's program actually does. HP said just 46% of its law firms were compliant with the program's requirements when it was rolled out in 2017 a number that now stands at 100%.

Blum said in an email Thursday that his group's public letter to Coca-Cola triggered ""numerous calls and emails"" about similar policies. He said they would be investigated ""and challenged in court if necessary.""

Blum calls Coke's program a 'racial quota'

It's not clear whether any lawsuit over Coca-Cola's diversity requirement would succeed. In a letter to Coke Blum's lawyers cited a provision of federal law that bans race discrimination in private contracting. Blum in a phone call said his group has ""no objection to companies casting a wide net looking for unique law firms unique contractors unique individuals companies that are owned by women companies that are owned by racial minorities companies that are owned by white men.""

""We have no squabble with that"" he said. ""We have a squabble with Coke because these are racial quotas and racial quotas are completely forbidden in American civil-rights jurisprudence.""

Stacy Hawkins a professor at Rutgers University said the private-contracting law likely doesn't apply to this situation. Law firms are owned by their equity partners and while the exact breakdown of law firm equity is often confidential law firm partnerships are overwhelmingly white.

""None of these policies or practices that have been adopted ... speak to the difference between majority- and minority-owned law firms"" she said. ""They speak to majority-owned firms and their use of minority lawyers.""

Coca-Cola wouldn't make Gayton or Douglas available for an interview but released a statement that said: ""When there is a leadership change it takes time for the new leader to review the current status of the team organization and initiatives. Monica is fully committed to the notions of equity and diversity in the legal profession and we fully expect she will take the time necessary to thoughtfully review any plans going forward.""

Tom Mars a former top lawyer at Walmart who helped the company add Black and Hispanic lawyers to its legal department expressed disbelief that any law firm would take a public stance against Coke's policy.

""What law firm wants to be known ... as the law firm that's opposed to promoting diversity in the legal profession?"" he said. ""That would be strategically insane.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlY3ljbGluZ3RvZGF5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2Rhay1zdGFsa2luZy1ob3JzZS1iaWctY2FyYm9ubGl0ZS1yZWFkaW5nLXBhLXBldC1yZWN5Y2xpbmctcGxhbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DAK Americas seeks to acquire CarbonLite's Pennsylvania plant,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVucXVlZW4uY29tLmhrL2J1cmdlci1raW5nLXVzLWxhdW5jaGVzLWdyZWVuLXBhY2thZ2luZy1waWxvdC1wcm9ncmFtLWV4cGFuZHMtbG9vcC1yZXVzYWJsZXMtdGVzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Burger King U.S. Launches Green Packaging Pilot Program Expands Loop Reusables Test,"4 Mins Read

In a recent announcement fast-food giant Burger King U.S. is testing sustainable alternatives for its cutlery straws drink lids frypods Whopper wrappers and napkins and will be further expanding its Loop reusables testing program through its partnership with The Coca-Cola Company and Kraft Heinz.

Burger King U.S. has launched a green packaging pilot program to create scalable solutions for eight of its most used items like Frypods that are developed with renewable unbleached virgin paperboard; cutlery created with cPLA a plant-based plastic; and napkins made out of 100% recycled fiber that will be tested in 51 of its restaurants in Miami.

In addition the company will test paper and plant-based straws along with strawless lids in an effort to phase out up to 500 million single-use plastic straws every year from all its participating restaurants in the country. This would mean that 910 metric tons of GHGs per year would be eliminated which is the equivalent of 196 vehicles driven for a year.

For Burger King’s Whopper sandwich wraps the company will test two new options that translate into a 13% and 34% reduction in the paper compared to previous wraps that could help eliminate 500 to 1500 metric tons of paper waste annually across the country.

In a press release seen by Green Queen head of innovation and sustainability at Burger King Matthew Banton said: “Sustainable packaging is a cornerstone of our restaurant brands for good journey and this new pilot represents a huge opportunity for us to make a difference. We’re optimistic about our progress and are committed to reducing waste to do our part in creating a more sustainable future.”

Once these solutions are available for patrons to test Burger King will use the feedback from consumers and accordingly improve the products and its overall alternative packaging system to launch these solutions on a larger scale next year.



Following its partnership with circular packaging startup Loop in October of last year to pilot reusable packaging for items like the Whopper and drinks the fast food giant plans to expand its solutions from existing locations like New York City Portland and Tokyo to Paris and London. To help facilitate this the fast-food giant will be joining hands with the Coca-Cola Company and Kraft Heinz and will use all the firm’s resources insights and packaging expertise to maximize the national potential of these solutions in the future.

Global companies and global brands have the power to help shape the world for good and Kraft Heinz is committed to a better future with responsible recycling and reusable initiatives Peter Hall president U.S. Away From Home Kraft Heinz

Vice president Global RBI Customer Team of The Coca-Cola Company Barry Danckert said that the team is always innovating and rethunking how consumers enjoy Coca-Cola beverages. “We are excited to partner with Burger King to offer a reusable packaging alternative for their guests. This effort supports The Coca-Cola Company’s World Without Waste initiative and virgin plastic reduction goal.”

“Burger King has been leading the charge in foodservice sustainability and Kraft Heinz is excited to partner with them and Loop to offer reusable packaging around the world. Global companies and global brands have the power to help shape the world for good and Kraft Heinz is committed to a better future with responsible recycling and reusable initiatives” concluded Peter Hall president U.S. Away From Home Kraft Heinz.

Several companies supermarkets and governments are innovating and thinking of sustainable alternatives and solutions to end single-use plastic packaging for instance recently as part of an environmental bill French grocery chains will be switching to food refill stations in an effort to completely end the use of disposable plastic packaging and even major brands like Unilever PepsiCo and Colgate-Palmolive will be discussing ways on implement circular solutions for olastic and packaging with biotechs such as LanzaTech and Modern Meadow in an upcoming two-day virtual Rethinking Materials conference that will be held between May 19-20.

First produced in May 1886 Coca-Cola was sold to 155 countries by the mid-1980s.

In Fiji it was bottled by Island Bottlers Limited. Peter Lee the marketing manager of Island Bottlers said the three factories in Fiji-in Suva Lautoka and Labasa had so far produced 30 million bottles of Coke since the factory in Suva went into production in 1972.

In 1886 an American pharmacist Dr John Pemberton developed the drink and it was sold then at 5c a glass.

He first sold it at Jacob’s Pharmacy in Atlanta Georgia.

In the first year Dr Pemberton sold an average of 13 drinks a day and his revenue amounted to just $35. Coca-Cola now (1986) averages 400 million servings daily worldwide.

The Coca-Cola Company was first registered in Fiji in 1942 but it was not until February 1972 that Island Bottlers brought the franchise to produce the product.

“The success of the product lies in its formula which has never changed in the last hundred years” Mr Lee said.

In 1936 the Coca-Cola Company produced a new formula used in making Diet-coke.

The new product had sugar removed and was a drink for diabetics and diet fanatics he said.

From one iconic drink Coca-Cola is now a total beverage company with over 200 beverage brands and 700000 employees across company and bottling partners."

The Teaneck New Jersey-based company’s digital revenues grew 15% year-on-year and contributed 44% to the total revenue in the March quarter up from 39% in the year-ago period.

“Within digital there are multiple areas we were able to make a significant difference overall. Visual engineering has grown significantly as a segment of our business; we have seen a lot of growth in digital experiences…These are all actually giving us a lot of confidence that we will continue to grow that segment"" Nambiar said in an interview.

“In terms of bookings much of the growth is actually coming from the digital space rather than the traditional space. The digital portfolio and the priority areas of our digital battleground are meaningfully outperforming the total company"" Nambiar said.

Cognizant chief executive officer Brian Humphries said during the earnings call that the company has successfully executed its strategy of embracing digital in the first quarter ended March. “Cloud migration and digital adoption create a significant opportunity for Cognizant in the coming years"" he said.

Cognizant has acquired four companies in the digital space in the March quarter alone. It announced acquisitions of Linium Servian Magenic and ESG Mobility targeted at strengthening its focus areas in cloud data digital engineering and internet of things (IoT).

The Texas resident is using his experience with the game to share his favorite stories through a new podcast bringing to life the golden age of baseball.

Spending an afternoon in Eddie Robinson's study in his longtime Fort Worth home is like spending a day in a baseball museum.

""I like to think that I played in a golden era of baseball. DiMaggio and Mantle and Vera and Ted Williams and I knew all those guys intimately well. In fact they were friends of mine. I had a great experience and look back on those days with a lot of interest"" Robinson said.

The 100 year old is the oldest living former major league baseball player and has stories for days including during his playing days in the 1940's when he assisted Babe Ruth in 1949 as the great Bambino's health was failing as he was honored in front of Yankees fans for the final time.

""They were going to retire a number. That was his last appearance at Yankee Stadium. It came time for him to go up to home plate for the presentation the ceremony. And I could tell that he was a little wobbly and I just felt that he needed some support. And the batting... bat rack was here. All the bats were there and I just reached in the bat rack and pulled out a bat and handed it to him and he took it and he took that bat and used it as a cane and went up to home plate had the bat. They had the ceremony I took a picture of him standing at home plate looking out toward centerfield. They took the picture from behind. And he's holding that bat. That was a Pulitzer prize-winning picture that year"" Robinson said.

it was an assist on one of the greatest baseball moments ever.

Robinson played on seven of the then eight teams in the American league before an eventual career in baseball front offices that included a five-year stint as the Texas rangers general manager in the 70s and 80's.

He's not shy about who he believes is the best player he ever saw in person.

""If I had to choose one guy I'd choose Ted Williams. He would be my guy because I think he's the best hitter ever lived"" Robinson said.

And it's baseball stories and opinions like those that's led Robinson to now begin his own baseball podcast. Yes at 100 years old it's called the Golden Age of Baseball with Eddie Robinson in which he shared stories of his more than 65 years as a baseball player scout coach and front office executive.

""I didn't even know what a podcast was. I never heard one sounded like something we could do"" Robinson said.

It was something he could easily do with charming baseball stories that never seem to end.

""Those pictures bring back memories. And you know there's so many stories to tell when you've been in the game as long as I have"" Robinson said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vY2lvLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9jb3Jwb3JhdGUtbmV3cy9yYWtlc2gtYmhhcmR3YWotam9pbnMtb2xhLWFzLWdsb2JhbC1jaW8vODI0ODAwNjPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rakesh Bhardwaj joins Ola as Global CIO,Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yMjgxODI4L2NsaWVudC1vbmJvYXJkaW5nLXNvbHV0aW9uLW1hcmtldC1vdXRsb29rLTIwMjEtYmlnLXRoaW5nc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Client Onboarding Solution Market Outlook 2021: Big Things are Happenings | Xerox NexJ Systems Onboard ...,"Client Onboarding Solution Market Outlook 2021: Big Things are Happenings | Xerox NexJ Systems Onboard Software Cognizant

CMCSA,Comcast,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9pc3BzLWZ1bmRlZC04NS1taWxsaW9uLWZha2UtY29tbWVudHMtb3Bwb3NpbmctbmV0LW5ldXRyYWxpdHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ISPs Funded 8.5 Million Fake Comments Opposing Net Neutrality,"The largest Internet providers in the US funded a campaign that generated “8.5 million fake comments” to the Federal Communications Commission as part of their fight against net neutrality rules during the Trump administration according to a report issued Thursday by New York state attorney general Letitia James.

Ars Technica This story originally appeared on Ars Technica a trusted source for technology news tech policy analysis reviews and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company Condé Nast.

Nearly 18 million out of 22 million comments were fabricated including both pro- and anti-net-neutrality submissions the report said. One 19-year-old submitted 7.7 million comments supporting net neutrality under fake randomly generated names. But the astroturfing effort by the broadband industry stood out because it used real people's names without their consent with third-party firms hired by the industry faking consent records the report said.

The New York Attorney General's Office began its investigation in 2017 and said it faced stonewalling from then FCC chair Ajit Pai who refused requests for evidence. But after a years-long process of obtaining and analyzing ""tens of thousands of internal emails planning documents bank records invoices and data comprising hundreds of millions of records"" the office said it ""found that millions of fake comments were submitted through a secret campaign funded by the country's largest broadband companies to manufacture support for the repeal of existing net neutrality rules using lead generators.""

It was clear before Pai completed the repeal in December 2017 that millions of people—including dead people—were impersonated in net neutrality comments. Even industry-funded research found that 98.5 percent of genuine comments opposed Pai's deregulatory plan. But Thursday's report reveals more details about how many comments were fake and how the broadband industry was involved.

""The broadband industry could not in fact rely on grassroots support for its campaign because the public overwhelmingly supported robust net neutrality rules"" the report noted. ""So the broadband industry tried to manufacture support for repeal by hiring companies to generate comments for a fee.""

The report said the industry campaign was run through Broadband for America (BFA) an umbrella group that includes Comcast Charter AT&T Cox and CenturyLink. Broadband for America also includes three trade groups namely CTIA which represents the wireless communications industry; NCTA–the Internet & Television Association; and the Telecommunications Industry Association. Verizon isn't listed as a Broadband for America member but it is part of the CTIA.

""BFA hid its role in the campaign by recruiting anti-regulation advocacy groups—unrelated to the broadband industry—to serve as the campaign's public faces"" the AG report said.

The ""primary funders"" of Broadband for America's campaign ""included an industry trade group and three companies that are among the biggest players in the United States internet phone and cable market with more than 65 million American subscribers among them and a combined market value of approximately half a trillion dollars"" the report said.

Comcast Charter and AT&T are the biggest members of Broadband for America. Comcast has 31.1 million residential customers in the broadband phone and TV categories combined. Charter has 29.4 million such customers. AT&T has 14.1 million internet customers and 15.9 million TV customers but it's not clear how much overlap there is between those two categories given that many DirecTV users don't live in AT&T's wireline territory.

The report mentions Comcast Charter and AT&T specifically without naming other internet service providers. And the sole mention of those ISPs came in a sentence saying ""Net neutrality refers to the principle that the companies that deliver internet service to your home business and mobile phone such as AT&T Comcast and Charter … should not discriminate among content on the internet.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vcGhpbGx5eWltYnkuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhLXlpbWJ5LWNvbXBhcmVzLW1hc3NpbmctcmVuZGVyaW5ncy1vZi10aGUtMTk4Ny1hbmQtMjAyMC1za3lsaW5lLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philadelphia YIMBY Compares Massing Renderings of the 1987 and the 2020 Skyline,"Over the decades the Philadelphia skyline has seen many transformations with different iconic images such as when City Hall stood all alone in the early 1900s. One of the key years in the high-rise history of the city is 1987 when One Liberty Place dramatically surpassed City Hall in height and opened later in the same year. Another key year is 2018 when the skyline gained its first supertall tower with the completion of the Comcast Technology Center. Today Philly YIMBY compares the skyline’s appearance in 1987 to its state in 2020.

In 1987 the citizens of Philadelphia looked on as the Liberty Place project transformed the skyline at a time when the development was often heavily criticized by people who insisted that the development would destroy the skyline. Among the opponents was city planner Edmund Bacon (the father of actor Kevin Bacon). The steel of One Liberty Place passed the William Penn Statue in September 1986 the floors topped out in December the spire was topped on May 27 1987 and the tower opened August 17 1987 as a gigantic blue glass and stone skyscraper rising high above the limited towers that could not pass 548 feet.

Flashing forward to last year the Liberty Place towers are now among the most admired skyscrapers in the skyline. However a taller development had risen in the skyline since then after being proposed in 2014. The 1121-foot-tall high-rise formerly known as the Comcast Innovation & Technology Center was also met with criticism mostly regarding its blocky design and how the lantern cooling towers and glass elevator shafts appeared to show West Philadelphia an obscene gesture. The tower started construction the just a few months after it was proposed and the steel reached the roof by the beginning of 2017. The lantern was topped on November 27th and the towers office portion opened in October 2018 while the Four Seasons opened in August 2019 giving the skyline its first supertall skyscraper.

Rainfall began in the morning and continued throughout the early afternoon.

The Mother's Day game — the finale of a three-game series — has been rescheduled for July 16 at 2:10 p.m. as part of a split doubleheader with the nightcap at 7:10 p.m. The doubleheader occurs on the first day back after the All-Star break.

The Tigers and Twins split the first two games in the series with the Tigers picking up a 7-3 victory Saturday behind a five-run seventh inning. They've won two of their past four games but have a 10-24 record for a .294 winning percentage.

TOP PROSPECT: Why the fixes for struggling Tigers prospect Spencer Torkelson are all in his head

MIZE UPDATE: How Casey Mize is 'finally putting in the effort on the mental side'

SHAWN WINDSOR:How have Tigers become a mess during rebuild? Al Avila bears most of the blame

Left-hander Matthew Boyd was supposed to start Sunday so his start will be pushed back to Tuesday — after the team's day off Monday. He is returning from left knee tendinitis which forced him to miss one start.

The Tigers will host the Kansas City Royals to Comerica Park for a three-game series from Tuesday-Thursday. After Boyd pitches Tuesday right-handers Casey Mize (Wednesday) and Spencer Turnbull (Thursday) are next up in the starting rotation.

[ The last MLB team to 10 wins the Tigers find success doing little things right ]

Then the Chicago Cubs arrive for a three-game series from Friday-Sunday before the Tigers hit the road to play the Seattle Mariners (May 17-19) and Royals (May 21-23). Before the Mother's Day contest was postponed lefty Tarik Skubal was slated to follow Turnbull in the rotation.

Therefore it seems likely Skubal will now start the series opener with the Cubs.

Only hours earlier he made the journey from Toledo where he was with the Triple-A squad to rejoin the Detroit Tigers for the first time since 2019.

The 26-year-old catcher is still considered a prospect by industry standards. But manager AJ Hinch gave a different assessment: ""He's not a young kid anymore. He's maturing and he should be able to handle this.""

There's a lot of pressure on Rogers — the name of a future Hall of Famer is attached to his baseball biography. He was acquired from the Houston Astros in the 2017 Justin Verlander trade. And when he arrived to the big leagues in 2019 the results were discouraging.

CLOCK TICKING: Jake Rogers finding solace and chasing his goal of being 'the guy'

Nearly two years — 588 days to be exact — after his last appearance for the Tigers Rogers gets another chance to prove his value. He was called up because starting catcher Wilson Ramos went to the 10-day injured list with a lumbar spine strain. If he plays well especially on offense he could stick around as the backup.

""There's an opportunity here"" Rogers said Saturday ahead of his first game. ""I want to make the most of it. I'm going to run with it. Hopefully I do pretty well up here and make a name for myself. If I stay up here I do. If I don't I'm going to go back down serve my time and wait. I'm just trying to help the team win.""

VERLANDER TRADE: Where do prospects from Justin Verlander trade fit in future?

TWO COOL:10 years later why Justin Verlander's 2nd no-hitter had him saying 'Swing the bat'

In 2019 Rogers went 14-for-112 (.125) with four home runs eight RBIs 13 walks and 51 strikeouts. Already an above-average defensive catcher he has refined his swing over the past three years with hitting instructor Doug Latta at Ball Yard Hitting Academy in Northridge California.

He knows improving his offense is how he'll stick in Detroit.

""I think that little stint in '19 helped me get my feet wet"" Rogers said. ""Now it's just trying to earn a job stuck up here and help the team win. That's what the big thing is: Get up here catch a W help the pitcher out there and get a few hits and drive some runs in.""

[ Jake Rogers' plan to work with AJ Hinch in spring: 'I hope he gets on me' ]

Yet Rogers did not return to the majors in 2020. With the minors canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic he spent his time at the alternate training site in Toledo. He admits missing out on a call-up made him ""a little angry"" but he tried to stay positive.

At the alternate site he faced his teammates in intrasquad games at Fifth Third Field. This allowed him get comfortable with his simplified swing. He has ditched the leg kick and extra head movement he had a few years ago.

""I feel like it's there"" Rogers said about his swing. ""It's close. Just trying to get that thing honed in to where we don't have to worry about it when it comes game time. ... I'm there. I believe I'm there and I think we're pretty close.""

HELPING HAND: How AJ Hinch plans to rewrite the story on prospect Jake Rogers

NEXT ARM UP: Lessons Matt Manning learned in Triple-A debut and more from Opening Day in Toledo

In spring training Rogers went 3-for-22 (.136) with one double one RBI one walk and 10 strikeouts. The Tigers gave him many opportunities to make the big-league squad but his lack of offensive production made them hesitate.

So the organization sent him to Triple-A.

He started at catcher for Toledo's Opening Day on Tuesday but he struck out three times and walked once in his four plate appearances. Now that Rogers is back in the majors Hinch is going to split his in-game reps with fellow catcher Grayson Greiner. (Greiner 28 will continue to catch rookie Casey Mize because Hinch ""likes how that's evolved."")

Greiner won the backup job over Rogers in camp.

""It's an opportunity for him"" Hinch said. ""I know he's going to handle the catching fine. I know he's going to be able to control the running game. There's going to be a microscope on his bat so we'll see.""

[ Why Detroit Tigers chose Grayson Greiner to be backup catcher over Jake Rogers ]

While Rogers' recall to the Tigers in 2021 has now-or-never vibes the aging prospect doesn't want to become overwhelmed. Ramos is set to return soon meaning a roster move is coming.

Rogers can't afford to let the pressure attack him.

""I don't really think of that"" Rogers said. ""If it's make or break it is what it is. I'm not a kid. I'm 26 and I want to be up here and stay with all these guys. I don't really think it's make or break. I just think I'm here to play and do my best.""

Managers of the operation which was purchased by E. & J. Gallo along with about 30 other Constellation wine and spirits brands for $1.7 billion in January held a meeting Thursday at 10 a.m. and told employees they were being laid off immediately.

“They told us in the meeting that sales went from $4.5 million to $1.8 million” said Kevin McDonald a Clos du Bois senior laboratory technician until Thursday. “And that’s because from my perspective Constellation stopped investing in the wineries they were selling.”

The winery employed about 37 workers McDonald said and all but about five lost their jobs. All of the winemakers were laid off he said. Others who lost their jobs included lab personnel the legal compliance team the barrel team and almost all of the cellar workers he said.

“I know of one foreman one manager and two or three other people who are going to be staying with the facility as babysitters basically” said McDonald who lives in Santa Rosa.

Lon Gallagher director of trade media and community relations for E. & J. Gallo Winery pointed to “changing market dynamics over the past two years” in an emailed statement Friday.

“We are transitioning the bulk of our production from the Clos du Bois winery to our other wineries in Sonoma County” Gallagher wrote. “We will maintain some operations at Clos du Bois moving forward but the current staffing levels are not needed for future production.”

The winery is located in the county’s Alexander Valley appellation. It was co-founded in 1974 by Frank Woods and former Secretary of the Air Force Tom Reed in 1974 with its first commercial wines being a chardonnay and a pinot noir.

The winery’s name French for an enclosed vineyard in the woods was a play on Woods’ own name.

The pair grew Clos du Bois quickly into a premium label before selling it in the late 1980s.

According to the winery’s website Woods was “a true pioneer in the California wine industry. He worked hard to bring Sonoma County wine to the world stage while also pursuing Chardonnay varietal wines specifically.”

With wines often priced in the $8 to $15 range the winery changed hands several times as the industry consolidated and shifted assets. Constellation bought the brand in 2007 as part of an $887 million transaction that included several others.

At the time Constellation Brands sold a number of its wineries the future of the Clos du Bois label was murkier than others according to analysts. Its legacy as Sonoma County’s first Bordeaux-style red blend and as a local premium brand during the 1980s faded over the years and the wine was priced as low as $7 per bottle when Gallo bought it.

On Saturday afternoon the winery’s gate was closed and the place looked deserted. A tasting room employee at the winery across the street Trentadue said the tasting room at Clos du Bois had been closed since the pandemic began.

Possibly because of smoke taint caused by the recent wildfires that affected county vineyards the winery contracted with no grapes had been delivered to the Clos du Bois facility for some time McDonald said.

“We didn’t have any wine in the cellar because they weren’t giving us any grapes” he said.

Up until Thursday he said employees were cross-training at other sites and other wines were being brought in for the staff to blend bottle and put their label on. McDonald said he was feeling good that during the pandemic he was working in agriculture which was considered an essential industry.

The company may use the Clos du Bois facility for storage he said.

Gallo’s Gallagher said in the email that the company is assisting laid-off employees to find other jobs “both within Gallo as well as externally. To aid these employees we will be providing one-on-one support along with a number of employment services.”

Gallagher did not respond to follow-up questions through email and voicemail Friday night or Saturday.

Gallo offered employees severance pay giving them credit for time worked when they were employed by Constellation McDonald said.

“That was nice of them” he said. “They are allowing us to apply for some internal positions.”

McDonald said he received 16 weeks of severance pay. He had been employed at Clos du Bois for between eight and nine years.

He has already revised his resume and has been looking for positions on winejobs.com.

“This provides a little fear” McDonald said. “It’s not a great time to not have a job.”

The United States is expected to play a supporting role in an international campaign to monitor greenhouse gas emissions from space.

Through the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites nations are coordinating efforts for space-based monitoring of air quality greenhouse gases the ozone layer and natural climate drivers like solar energy. China Europe and Japan are making major investments in satellites to help verify how well countries are fulfilling commitments they made to reducing greenhouse gas emissions as part of the Paris climate agreement.

The United States in contrast is preparing to demonstrate sophisticated greenhouse gas sensor technologies but currently has no plans for ambitious atmospheric monitoring missions.

“Other countries are making great contributions and pushing as hard as they possibly can” said David Crisp a NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory atmospheric physicist helping to coordinate efforts to track carbon dioxide and methane by the 34 space agencies that make up the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites. “We are relying on their contributions. There’s no way around that at this point but I would like our country to lead.”

Through the Paris climate pact signed in 2015 174 countries and the European Union agreed to take steps to mitigate global warming and report their progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Those reports called the global stocktake are due every five years beginning in 2023.

NEW PRIORITIES

The Trump administration announced plans in 2017 to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement and did not support greenhouse-gas monitoring initiatives. It’s not yet clear whether that work will get a significant boost from the Biden administration.

Hours after taking office President Joe Biden signed an executive order recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement and Biden often refers to “tackling the climate crisis” as one of his top priorities.

Still there are many ways the federal government works to address climate change aside from monitoring greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.

NASA develops and demonstrates technology to monitor the ozone layer air pollution ocean chemistry and changes in sea and land ice. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides long-term monitoring of those conditions in addition to offering extensive observation of global temperatures precipitation ice and ocean conditions.

NASA OR NOAA?

Experts disagree on whether greenhouse gas monitoring is a job for NASA or NOAA.

“NASA is the pathfinder” said Barry Lefer NASA’s Tropospheric Composition Program manager. “We build the first one prove that works and then we hope that there are NOAA follow-ons.”

NASA for example proved it could measure carbon monoxide in the troposphere with the Microwave Limb Sounder on the Aura Earth observation satellite launched in 2004. NOAA now provides similar data with the Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite on the Joint Polar Satellite System.

Monitoring carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is trickier. To provide the global stocktake reports mandated by the Paris Agreement the United States would need to measure atmospheric carbon with great precision and high spatial resolution.

“NASA is probably the only agency that could build that system” said Crisp who was the principal investigator for NASA’s first carbon dioxide monitoring mission the Orbiting Carbon Observatory. “However once built and launched it could be delivered to NOAA for use as an operational system.”

Europe plans to make weekly global measurements of methane and carbon dioxide with the two-satellite Copernicus Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide Monitoring CO2M mission. Japan plans to make similar observations with its GOSAT satellite series as does China with its TanSat satellites.

Neither NASA nor NOAA have similarly ambitious programs underway. That could change if Congress approves the Biden administration’s plan to increase NASA and NOAA budgets.

BIDEN BUDGET

The Biden budget blueprint calls for adding $1.4 billion to NOAA’s 2022 budget partly “to expand its climate observation and forecasting work and provide better data and information to decisionmakers.”

The new administration also proposes a 12.5% increase in NASA Earth science funding or about $250 million above 2021 levels “to initiate the next generation of Earth observing satellites to study pressing climate science questions” according to the budget summary released April 9.

It’s too soon to say how the agencies would spend the money.

NASA funding could be directed toward a series of missions recommended in the 2017 Earth Science decadal survey to determine how Earth’s climate water cycle soil and vegetation are changing. The decadal survey also mentioned greenhouse gas monitoring as an option for a future Explorer-class mission but little has been done to flesh out that concept.

Instead NASA is continuing to gather data with atmospheric sensors in orbit and demonstrating new technologies to measure greenhouse gases.

Two NASA sensors are scheduled to travel to geostationary orbit as hosted payloads on commercial satellites within two years.

The Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring Pollution sensor or TEMPO is designed to provide hourly pollution reports for North America with a resolution of 10 square kilometers during the day.

“If things happen like hurricanes or fires we can look at part of the field of regard more frequently” said Kelly Chance TEMPO principal investigator at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. “For example we can observe a sixth of North America every 10 minutes.”

Geostationary Carbon Observatory or GeoCarb is a staring sensor to track atmospheric carbon dioxide carbon monoxide and methane over North and South America.

NOAA plans to include an instrument similar to GeoCarb on its next generation of geostationary weather satellites scheduled to begin launching in the early 2030s.

For now NASA identifies CO2 sources and sinks with the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 launched in 2014 and the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 mounted on the International Space Station in 2019.

OCO-2 and OCO-3 were designed to show that NASA could make measurements from space with the necessary accuracy and precision to monitor global carbon dioxide emissions in areas roughly the size of Texas.

Based on that criteria the sensors have been extremely effective. To verify Paris Agreement emissions targets though the United States would need a satellite constellation offering higher resolution data and greater global coverage.

COMMERCIAL DATA

Could the private sector play a role in making those observations?

“The technology is here today to do that kind of work with very small satellites” said Charles Beames chairman of the SmallSat Alliance. “Startups with ambitions to do that are in various phases of fundraising. Frankly I think the government needs to either buy commercial satellites or buy the data whichever is in their best interest.”

Commercial small satellites tend to focus on detecting methane rather than carbon dioxide.

“Atmospheric CO2 has a long lifetime” said Ken Jucks NASA Upper Atmosphere Research program manager. “You need a very precise measurement because the new CO2 emitted during a particular hour produces a very small change in the total amount of CO2.”

Canada’s GHGSat is identifying important methane sources with 15-kilogram satellites. MethaneSAT LLC a subsidiary of the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund is preparing to launch a 350-kilogram satellite in late 2022 or early 2023 to pinpoint faint methane emissions from oil and gas fields.

All the publicly and privately funded satellites have roles to play in the global greenhouse gas observing system Lefer said.

Japan’s GOSAT-2 measures CO2 and methane within 10-kilometer-diameter areas that are separated by about 150 kilometers. The Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument on Europe’s Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite obtains global daily observations with 49-square-kilometer resolution.

When those satellites detect atmospheric methane they can share the data with GHGSat which can pinpoint sources down to 50 square meters or MethaneSAT which will offer 1 kilometer resolution.

UNCERTAIN FUTURE

Beyond TEMPO and GeoCarb NASA has no greenhouse gas missions underway.

“It’s to be determined what NASA’s next move is going to be after GeoCarb” Lefer said.

If Crisp could chart the course he’d encourage the United States to gather and share global greenhouse gas data like it does weather data.

“If we add a U.S. system to the European and Japanese systems just like we do for weather forecasting we might even get China to share its contributions” Crisp said. “Once we get some big players involved there’s more incentive for everyone to share data.”

Design

The OnePlus 8 Pro has a large 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 3168 x 1440 resolution. It also packs a fast 120Hz refresh rate for smoother gaming and better web scrolling among other features. It’s protected with Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3D. The near bezel-free display has a punch-hole front-facing camera on the top left corner. It uses glass on the back with an aluminum frame. The rear cameras are set up in the upper center part of the phone’s back inside a raised stretched-out oval design.

The iPhone 12 Pro has a smaller 6.1-inch OLED display with a resolution of 2532 x 1170. There’s no fast refresh support for this phone but it is made of a new material called Ceramic Shield which uses nano-ceramic crystals for better protection against falls. Unfortunately you still have to deal with a big notch on the top of the display. It houses the front-facing camera and its facial recognition sensors. The iPhone 12 Pro’s rear cameras are placed on the top left corner of the phone’s back in a raised square design. The device uses a stainless-steel chassis.

Both of these phones lack a headphone jack. Both also are IP68 rated for water and dust resistance which means they should keep working even if you accidentally drop them in the pool.

Hardware

David Imel / Android Authority

The iPhone 12 Pro uses Apple’s latest in-house processor the A14 Bionic. It includes a six-core CPU and a four-core GPU. It also has a neural engine chip with 16 cores for better machine learning performance. The OnePlus 8 Pro uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor. Both are fast chips for their respective platforms (iOS and Android) but the A14 Bionic is the winner according to our benchmarking tests.

Both phones support 5G networks. The unlocked OnePlus 8 Pro supports low-band and mid-band 5G hardware but there’s no mmWave support. The iPhone 12 Pro supports 6Ghz networks but the ones sold in the US also support mmWave networks found on Verizon Wireless.

The iPhone 12 Pro has 6GB of RAM and its onboard storage includes 128 256 and 512GB models. You can buy the OnePlus 8 Pro with either 8GB or 12GB of RAM and there are 128GB and 256GB storage options. It should be noted that the 8GB/128GB option is not available in the US. Neither phone offers expandable storage via a microSD card slot.

The iPhone 12 Pro has a 2815mAh battery. If you use an optional 20W wired charger the phone will go up to 50% of its full capacity in 30 minutes. The phone also sports a feature called MagSafe. Accessories that support MagSafe use magnets that attach to the rear of the iPhone 12 models. That includes wireless chargers and when connected to the iPhone 12 Pro they will charge the handset at 15W speeds. It also still supports Qi-based wireless chargers but with 7.5W speeds.

The OnePlus 8 Pro has a 4510mAh battery and includes a Warp Charge 30T wired charger for 30W speeds. It also supports 30W wireless charging as well.

Cameras

David Imel / Android Authority

The OnePlus 8 Pro goes all out on the camera front at least in terms of hardware. It includes a 48MP main sensor an 8MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom and a 48MP ultra-wide sensor. It also has a 5MP color filter that is supposed to process light differently to give images different looks. There’s also a 16MP front-facing camera. In our review of the phone we thought the cameras took solid images but the hardware color filter sensor was more of a gimmick.

The iPhone 12 Pro has three camera sensors each of which is 12MP in size. The rear camera setup has the main sensor a telephoto camera and an ultrawide camera. It also has a LiDAR scanner in the back which is used to record pixel depth information. This is supposed to reduce capture time for images and video clips along with improving AR experiences. There’s also a 12MP front-facing camera.

Additionally the iPhone 12 Pro supports recording video with HDR and Dolby Vision HDR support at up to 60fps. In our review we felt that the image quality was solid from the phone along with good stable video recording.

Software

David Imel / Android Authority

The iPhone 12 Pro ships with the new iOS 14 out of the box. It includes new features like supporting widgets on the phone’s home screen along with the App Library that helps to better organize a user’s phone apps. It also adds picture-in-picture support for watching videos or conducting FaceTime calls while continuing to use another app on the phone. Apple has a solid track record on providing both security and major OS updates for its previous iPhones and we expect the iPhone 12 Pro won’t be an exception.

The OnePlus 8 Pro ships with Android 10 and its in-house OxygenOS 10 skin out of the box. However recently the company started rolling out the big OxygenOS 11 update for the phone based on Android 11. It includes a major UI revamp along with an always-on ambient display improvements to Dark Mode Zen Mode and more. OnePlus has promised to offer at least two more OS updates for the OnePlus 8 Pro.

It’s the most affordable phone in the Mi 11 series that you can get but of course it’s got a few drawbacks from its flagship-grade siblings and even to its 5G edition. We’ve been using it for more than a week now and this is our full review.

Design and Construction

When Xiaomi said “lite” they probably meant it literally too since this device is seriously lightweight at 157g. It’s even lighter than most budget smartphones today which makes it a bit awkward to hold as someone who’s used to hefty phones. It takes some getting used to—especially if you have man-sized hands.

Then again it doesn’t give a cheap impression at all. Its smooth frosted glass back and dazzling design give off an elegant touch that’s a lot similar to the other higher models in the Mi 11 series. What sets it apart though is its flat structure which doesn’t really bother us that much as its feathery weight makes it easy to grip. We also like how it doesn’t attract many fingerprint smudges. The unit we have is in the Bubblegum Blue colorway and this 4G version is also available in Boba Black and Peach Pink.

Its camera module inherits the square-shaped Mi 11 design with a slim bump that can be fixed when topped with a case. It has three lenses in it together with the LED flash. Then at the bottom part of the rear is some subtle Xiaomi branding.

For buttons and ports there’s nothing on the left side but on the right are the volume rocker and the slightly curved power button which doubles as a fingerprint scanner.

Up top there’s an IR blaster and a secondary microphone.

While at the bottom are the loudspeaker USB Type-C port main microphone and a hybrid card slot for either 2 nano-SIM cards or 1 nano-SIM plus a microSD card. There’s no headphone port here but we do get a free Type-C to headphone jack adapter in the box.

Display and Multimedia

Focusing on display the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite is fitted with a 6.55-inch AMOLED screen with a resolution of 2400 x 1080px and a pixel density of 402ppi. It doesn’t have some curved sides like its siblings but we do still get a 240Hz touch sampling rate and up to 90Hz refresh rate that you can tone down to 60Hz if you want to save battery life.

The bezels all around are slim and on the upper right side resides the selfie camera. Of course on top of the display is the call speaker. We get Corning Gorilla Glass 5 for protection and it’s worth mentioning that the 5G edition gets a layer of Gorilla Glass 6. This LTE version also supports HDR10 while the 5G one supports HDR10+.

Either way if we’re not gonna compare this AMOLED display looks vibrant on its own with accurate colors and inky blacks. It supports 10-bit color as well so it can display up to 1.07 billion colors—which is something that we can find in a few flagship smartphones today.

In the display settings you can switch between the usual Light Mode and Dark Mode; turn on Sunlight Mode to adjust the brightness to intense ambient light when automatic brightness is off; and you can even take advantage of the Reading mode which asides from reducing the amount of blue light it has a Paper mode that gives an additional paper texture for your reading sessions.

You can also change the color scheme to the Original Saturated and Auto option that automatically blends the colors based on your current lighting. The Always-On Display feature is also available and it is packed with numerous themes that are all customizable.

As for audio quality its dual speakers can get loud enough for a medium-sized room and it’s actually outstanding for a mid-range device. There’s clarity and noticeable highs and mids however don’t expect much bass on it.

Cameras

When it comes to cameras unlike its Mi 11 big brothers that have high-grade camera systems the Mi 11 Lite gets a few trimming in this category. Its triple rear shooters are composed of a 64MP F1.8 main an 8MP F2.2 ultrawide and a 5MP F2.4 telemacro lens that promises 2x magnification compared to normal macro lenses. As for selfies it has a 16MP F2.5 front camera.

The camera app itself should be familiar for old-time Android users and you can still find here some of Xiaomi’s quirky camera features such as short video vlog mode dual video long exposure clone and movie effects for those awesome transitions.

Quality-wise shots taken from the rear cameras often look sharp with accurate colors and decent dynamic range especially under good lighting conditions. Leaving the AI turned on gives off a small image boost that still maintains good color reproduction. The standard mode also gives a depth effect which is nice.





































You can zoom in up to 10x but if you want to see extra details you can switch the picture quality in the settings to high or simply use its 64MP lens!

The wide-angle camera provides almost the same quality as the standard mode however it tends to have some subtle fisheye effect sometimes. Macro mode on the other hand works very well. We get good subject background separation and high-quality details. For night photography using its dedicated night mode gives a slight boost in exposure but it can still seem shadowy oftentimes.





As for its front camera there’s no wide-angle option available but quality-wise photos look natural a bit smooth and fall more on warmer tones. When you use the portrait mode though it struggles in dynamic range. But then if you use the normal selfie camera the HDR works fine. It’s weird but hopefully it can be fixed with a software update.











Talk about video quality you can record up to 4k at 30fps however you can only use the steady video stabilization for 1080p at 30fps. It comes with cool native video features like tracking moving objects beautify and movie filters. Moreover you can also use the Pro mode for shooting videos.

OS UI and Apps

Running the software is Xiaomi’s MIUI 12 based on Android 11 and it features a familiar organized interface that offers a number of customization options. It still comes with a few ads and pre-installed apps such as Google Facebook Netflix and some Xiaomi proprietary apps that you can uninstall if you don’t plan on using them.

Now MIUI 12 also provides the option to use either the usual Android drop-down notification and control center format or the newer style that’s a lot similar to the iOS design. Moreover you can navigate with gestures or the on-display buttons and you can also use an app drawer if you prefer. If you want to keep things simple you can turn on the Lite mode launcher in the home screen options.

With an IR blaster on board you can use the Mi 11 Lite as a universal remote via the Mi remote app. While other features include second space Video Toolbox floating window one-handed mode digital wellbeing and parental controls.

Out of the 128GB of internal storage we get a usable 111GB that’s expandable up to 512GB through the hybrid card slot.

Performance and Benchmarks

Under the hood the LTE Mi 11 Lite is equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 732G chipset an Adreno 618 GPU and 8GB of RAM. It is lower compared to other smartphones in the Mi 11 series but nonetheless it runs smoothly for basic tasks such as video streaming web and social media browsing messaging and even recording videos.

For gaming it can run heavy titles such as Genshin Impact Asphalt 9 and PUBG Mobile steadily with some occasional frame drops every now and then. You can turn on the Game Turbo for a boosted gaming experience or switch the graphic settings to the lowest available for better optimization.

Here are the results we got in our standard benchmark apps:

AnTuTu v8 – 289578

Geekbench 5 – 485 (Single-core) 1651 (Multi-core)

(Single-core) (Multi-core) PCMark – 8107 (Work 2.0)

(Work 2.0) 3DMark – 2615 (SSE – OpenGL ES) 1104 (SSE – Vulkan)

(SSE – OpenGL ES) (SSE – Vulkan) AndroBench – 505.91 MB/s (Read) 271.88 MB/s (Write)

For biometrics you can unlock the device via facial recognition and the side-mounted fingerprint scanner. Both are snappy and reliable but surely expect the physical fingerprint sensor to work faster.

Connectivity and Battery Life

The Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite is equipped with dual SIM 4G LTE WiFi Bluetooth 5.1 GPS Android Auto screencast and NFC.

With a slim body the Mi 11 Lite is loaded with a decent 4250mAh battery with 33W fast charging. It comes with a complete charger in the package that can juice up the device within 1 hour from 0 to 100%.

We ran it through the PCMark’s battery test under a 90Hz display and it got a fair 12 hours and 54 minutes. Meanwhile in our standard video loop test which entails playing a 1080p video on loop at 50% brightness 0% volume and airplane mode turned on it yielded a very good 21 hours and 10 minutes. So it can last you a full day if you’re not a heavy user.

Conclusion

The Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite has an official price of PHP 14990 which sure is more affordable than the other smartphones in the Mi 11 series. As a mid-range device on its own it’s pretty straightforward and ready for your day-to-day casual use. Of course you don’t get much of the flagship features but it still stands out with its utterly slim design a good set of cameras and vibrant AMOLED display. It’s a very good phone to consider in its price range although there are other Xiaomi mid-rangers that have tad bit better specs compared to it.

And that wraps up this review. Share with us what you think about the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite in the comments.

The Huawei P8 is the latest flagship smartphone from Huawei. The P8 incarnates everything fancy about the Chinese smartphone manufacturer and is one of the finest Android smartphones on the market right now.

Avid Huawei fans might have noticed the notable absence of the iconic ‘Ascend’ tag that has existed on all Huawei premium smartphones. Huawei retired the Ascend brand earlier on in the year and as a result the smartphone is simply refered to as the P8.

Here is what the Huawei Ascend P8 has to offer.

Technical Specifications

Display

Display Size: 5.2 inches

Display Type: IPS LCD

Screen Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels

Screen Resolution Density: 424 ppi

Screen Protection: Corning Gorilla Glass 3

You get a 5.2 inches 1080p Full HD display with the P8. Most expected that the Huawei P8 will like most of its peers sport a fancy 2k display.

Huawei was however clear that for now it will stay clear from 2K/4k displays citing battery draining issues. You therefore have to settle for the 1080p display which is something similar to what you get on the Huawei Ascend P7.

The 1080p display on the P8 isn’t exactly a deal breaker. However if you the kind of buyer that goes straight for what is Grade A on the market you should direct your attention to the 2K displays on the Samsung Galaxy S6 and LG G4.

Design

Frame Dimensions: 144.9 x 72.1 x 6.4 mm

Weight: 144 g

The design profile of the Huawei P8 is an aspect that i believe simply embarasses most of its rivals. You get a solid all-steel uni-body exterior treated by what Huawei describes as Diamond Blasting.

By the way by a uni-body design i imply a concept where the smartphone is compact with no removable rear cover.

I really liked HTC One M9 design but frankly i like the P8 design much better. The Huawei P8 has a super slim profile and is the thinest among the mainstream flagship smartphones.

Performance

Operating System: Android OS v5.0.2 (Lollipop)

CPU: Quad-core 2 GHz Cortex-A53 & quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53

RAM: 3 GB

Internal Memory: 16/64 GB

Micro SD: Yes up to 128 GB

The perfomance profile of the Huawei P8 is nothing but impressive. You get two quad core CPUs one clocked at 2 Ghz while the other is clocked at 1.5 Ghz.

If you couple this with the ample 3GB RAM everything from the intensive gaming to multitasking between open application becomes a flawless affair.

The P8 is available in 16/64 GB variants. The 64GB model features some a slightly beefed up perfomance profile.

Camera

Rear Camera: 13 MP

Secondary Camera: 8 MP

LED Flash: Yes

The Huawei P8 has a 13MP rear camera and a 8 MP selfie snapper. The camera does an excellent job in terms of image clarity but recording is however limited to just 1080p.

Battery and Extras

Battery Capacity: Li-Po 2680 mAh

Extras

Dual SIM

Rivals of the Huawei P8

Rivals of the Huawei P8 includes the Samsung Galaxy S6 and HTC M9.

Verdict

Android smartphones are becoming bigger and better. Design is now a critical factor that gives flagship smartphones an edge over competition.

The Huawei P8 is a smartphone that is first and foremost perfect for buyers who prioritize design over everything else. Second the P8 is for someone who simply wants a smartphone rather than on undersized phablet.

Price

The Huawei P8 has a suggested retail price of Ksh.54999 in Kenya.

The Zero3 features a significant number of upgrades that makes it one of the best mid-range smartphones on the market.

In fact to be fair the Infinix Zero3 largely features a range of high-end flagship features and its affordable price tag is what gives the smartphone the mid-range tag.

That said here is what the Infinix Zero 3 has to offer.

Infinix Zero3 Technical Specifications

Camera

Rear Camera: 20.7 MP

Secondary Camera: 5 MP

The Camera of the Infinix Zero3 is a stand out feature of the smartphone. You get a 20.7 MP primary camera that promises to over deliver.

The 20.7 MP packs a SONY IMX230 CMOS sensor which is optimized to achieve excellent focus tracking of fast-moving subjects. The Infinix Zero3 camera is in addition to this able to capture HDR-grade images.

The Infinx Zero3 camera also supports a 4K video recording a feature you will fall in love with.

Display

Display Size: 5.5-inch

Display Type: IPS LCD

Screen Resolution: 1920 x 1080 Pixels

Screen Resolution Density: 400 ppi

Screen Protection: Corning Gorilla Glass 3

You get a 5.5-inch IPS LCD display with the Infinix Zero3. The 1920 x 1080 Pixels Full HD display and 400 ppi display resolution density. A 400 ppi screen resolution density is high but still not as impressive as the 576 ppi you will find on the Samsung Galaxy S6.

Also it is quite disappointing that Infinix replaced the Amoled display found on the two previous smartphones from the Zero range with an IPS LCD. You might argue differently but the benefits of an Amoled display are well documented.

Other than that you get a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection layer an excellent feature that gives the Infinix Zero3 an edge over its rivals.

Design

Dimensions: 154×76.7×7.85 mm

The Infinix Note 8 packs a 6.95-inch IPS LCD display. The display has a 720 x 1640 pixels resolution and a screen resolution density (a measure of sharpness) of 258 ppi. The smartphone’s display is therefore bright and vibrant even under direct sunlight.

The display size of Note 8 is identical to that of the Infinix Note 7.

Dimensions: 175.3 x 78.8 x 9 mm

The Infinix Note 8 assumes the typical Infinix Note series look. So the smartphone is quite large primary due to the generous screen real estate.

The other noteworthy bit is that the placement of the camera of the rear section of the smartphone gives the smartphone a premium feel something that I liked.

Operating System: Android 10

I mean with deals like these on popular items we love how could you not be a mega fan?! While we’re constantly on the lookout for what’s new at Costco we also make sure we stock up on all of our favorite products whenever we get the chance. After all it is so disappointing when items sell out — or worse — disappear for months.

Well we just found out that Costco has a sneaky way of letting shoppers know if an item won’t be restocked in the near future. Introducing: the Costco ‘Death Star’ an asterisk you might see on the price tag next to a few products on your next trip. Read on to find out exactly what it means and what you should do if you see the death star on your go-to picks.

Popular Costco fan account @costcohotfinds shared the info on TikTok and said: “My favorite coffee has the dreaded asterisk on the price tag also known as the death star at Costco. This means that it won’t be restocked at least for a period of time maybe not even again this year.” They added: “If you see the death star on your favorite item you may want to think about stocking up.”

In summary: an item with an asterisk on the price tag means either that the item will not be restocked or the item was discontinued. While there’s no official solution to ensuring your products get restocked a few people in the comments did have some suggestions.

“Leave feedback/suggestions in the box! Costco employees say it’s the best way to get something in/back” wrote one user while another chimed in to confirm: “YES THIS!!! As an ex Costco employee the feedback box is the way to go to gauge interest.”

It might not be a sure-fire way but at the very least it brings it to Costco’s attention — which can’t hurt.

Another solution for Costco members? Well it might be time to just stock up.

And the same goes for the food court at Costco. The eat-in section of the beloved warehouse is growing and old discontinued favorites are being made available again. Plus even the way the food court operates is being updated.

Bringing back ice cream and smoothies.

For many there's nothing quite like a sweet cool treat after a successful warehouse run. Unfortunately Costco took them off the menu when the pandemic started but now ice cream and smoothies are back! There's no word yet on any price or ingredient changes unlike other items.

If you're trying to stay healthy it may be best to avoid some menu items after you shop. Here are The Best & Worst Menu Items at Costco's Food Court.

Bringing back churros.

Yep churros are back too. But in case you haven't heard they got a makeover during their pandemic menu hiatus. The new churros are bigger which means there's more crunch and cinnamon sugar. What's also bigger is the price: they're now $1.49 instead of $1.

Adding touchless soda dispensers.

One Reddit user recently discovered a new addition to the food court that follows along with coronavirus era rules—a touchless soda machine.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

According to commenters it works exactly how you think it will: by placing your cup underneath the sensors pick up the movement and begin to pour. One Reddit user says it's just like the touchless sinks in bathrooms.

The original poster didn't mention exactly where the machine is but another said a Costco in Seattle has one but that it's a little different.

Adding outdoor seating (and maybe indoor soon!).

After grabbing a new or classic food court treat you no longer have to sit in your car and eat it. Costco is adding outdoor seating to warehouses again according to CNN. Since masks are still required inside and samples are to-go only it may be a little while until indoor seating is available again too but it's reportedly in discussion (so keep your eyes and ears peeled!).

Keeping condiments straws and cutlery behind the counter.

Unlike adding touchless soda machines so customers can get their own drinks Costco is still keeping condiments straws cups cutlery napkins and more utensils behind the counter. You'll still have to ask an employee for anything you need (like ketchup mustard onions or relish for your $1.50 hot dog and soda combo). It can be tricky to clean the stations after each customer touches them so removing them altogether was a choice many retailers and restaurants made last year.

While this isn't really a recent change it's a pandemic food court rule the warehouse chain is keeping around for a little while longer.

Adding a chicken sandwich to the menu…in Canada.

You probably have a favorite fast-food chicken sandwich but if you live in one area it could have a new rival. Costco just debuted a Crispy Chicken Sandwich in Canada and one Instagram account @costcodeals posted all the details.

The sandwich comes with chicken and spicy mayo on a soft cheese bun. Some Costco shoppers who've had it say it's delicious and others simply want to get the chance to try it themselves soon but they'll have to wait. A Costco spokesperson told Eat This Not That! that the chain has no comment on whether or not the sandwich will be available in the U.S. anytime soon.

Strang said during a briefing that ""it is not the time to go to Costco for sandals you heard were in stock. It's critical you limit your trips.""

King Arthur Carrousel once again shines like the crown jewel of Fantasyland after Disneyland’s maintenance crew replaced the carousel’s steel canopy and freshened up the hand-carved horses during the 13-month coronavirus closure of Disneyland. The Fantasyland carousel returned with the reopening of the Anaheim theme park on April 30.

The Fantasyland centerpiece closed in January 2020 a few months before the park was shuttered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The carousel project was expected to take four months. Aerial views of Disneyland showed the carousel remained behind construction walls throughout the closure. After 15 months away King Arthur Carrousel is back and looking better than new again.

REVIEW: Disneyland reimagines Snow White ride just as Walt would have wanted

King Arthur Carrousel dominates the central courtyard behind Sleeping Beauty Castle — rotating and galloping like the beating heart of the land. Along with the neighboring Dumbo the Flying Elephant King Arthur Carrousel brings a kinetic energy to Fantasyland that puts the themed land’s classic stories of youth into motion.

After more than a year away the Disneyland carousel is again the perfect place to people watch and see the land from a unique perspective at the very center of the action.

Disneyland’s maintenance team worked closely with Walt Disney Imagineering on the project that refreshed one of the park’s most iconic attractions.

Imagineering took the canopy back to an older color scheme with parchment whites purples and magentas. The shields and heraldry along the carousel’s perimeter represent the Knights of the Round Table. Artisans retouched the paint on all the horses reset the bridle jewels and applied new gold leaf.

The refreshed ride looks stunning. The freshly painted horses gleam in the midday sun. The gold leaf trim that adorns the mesmerizing ornate carvings inside the canopy glistens amid rows of amber lights. Purple bunting flutters as matching canopies slowly sway in the breeze.

Overhead support beams above the horses pop with regal color in vibrant purples baby blues and burnt oranges. A central pipe organ plays familiar Disney songs — transporting riders back to the early days of amusement parks when carousels were the big draw.

At night King Arthur Carrousel sparkles like a bedazzled jewel. The glowing merry-go-round beckons visitors through the castle gates — like a glimmering magnet pulling people through the entry to Fantasyland.

King Arthur Carrousel is older than Disneyland. The vintage ride was built in 1922 and moved to Disneyland for opening day in 1955. The classic Dentzel merry-go-round operated at Sunnyside Beach Park in Toronto before it was relocated to Disneyland.

The latest refurbishment of King Arthur Carrousel was less comprehensive than past work on the ride.

In 2002 and 2003 King Arthur Carrousel underwent an extensive yearlong restoration project that rebuilt the rotating platform and added a computer-controlled ride system. New bench seats reduced the number of steeds from 72 to 68.

The carousel was moved farther away from Sleeping Beauty Castle in 1983 as part of the New Fantasyland project. A 1975 overhaul of the carousel painted all the horses white and added custom-designed color schemes and decorative jewels to the bridles saddles and breastplates.

The most recent makeover included touch-up paint for the horses and ride structure along with a new metal canopy. The canopy roof panels were painted in place to ensure a consistent look of the design elements.

The pandemic closure of the park actually made it easier to work on King Arthur Carrousel — which is right in the middle of Fantasyland with no backstage access. Materials and cranes could be brought in without concern for disturbing visitors — who were kept out of Disneyland by the coronavirus closure for 412 days.

Occasional park visitors may not even notice any difference now that the work is done on the carousel — beyond COVID-19 precautions requiring every other row of horses be left empty with one party per row. Longtime Disneyland fans will recognize the colors popping a lot more on the Fantasyland centerpiece.

Linguists will note that Disney spells King Arthur Carrousel with two Rs as opposed to the more traditional carousel with one R. Disney isn’t consistent with the spelling though. Jessie’s Critter Carousel and the former King Triton’s Carousel of the Sea and Carousel of Progress all employ the single R spelling.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpbmNvbG5zaGlyZXdvcmxkLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Blb3BsZS90b3AtZmlsbWluZy1sb2NhdGlvbnMtaW4tbGluY29sbnNoaXJlLTMyMjgyNjDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top filming locations in Lincolnshire,"With a wealth of stately homes stunning gardens and historic buildings many films and TV series have been filmed in Lincolnshire over the years.

Some are more well-known than others so how many of these did you know were used as locations for some of these popular films and TV shows?

Burghley House - With such a stunning manor house and surrounding grounds it's not surprising that Stamford's Burghley House has been featured in so many Hollywood period dramas. Just some of these include the 2005 remake of Pride and Prejudice Elizabeth: A Golden Age and Middlemarch. Filming is also currently underway at Burghley as the exterior of Bruce Wayne's home Wayne Manor for The Flash set to be released next year.

Belvoir Castle - The Crown Netflix's hit show about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II was filmed at Belvoir Castle's Regency Castle which stood in for Windsor Castle in the hit series which stars A-list celebrities including Olivia Colman Helena Bonham-Carter and Claire Foy as the royals. Also filmed at Belvoir was 2000's drama The Golden Bowl starring Kate Beckinsale James Fox and Uma Thurman.

Boston (various locations) - Hollywood star Rob Lee was spotted several times around Boston during the filming of 2019's ITV series Wild Bill which sees a US cop flee to the fens of Lincolnshire with his teenaged daughter. As well as the famous Boston Stump the Sessions House Dolphin Lane West Street Tunnard Street High Street the town bridge the Market Place Antons Gowt Freiston Shore Butterwick and Bicker Fen were also used as filming locations for Wild Bill.

Lincoln Cathedral - The city's famous cathedral has stood in for Westminster Abbey on several occasions most notably in the blockbuster films The Da Vinci Code in 2006 - starring Tom Hanks Audrey Tatou and Sir Ian McKellan - and Young Victoria in 2009 starring Emily Blunt as well as Netflix film The King in 2018. According to IMDB Lincoln Cathedral's bell was silent for the first time since the second world war while filming took place.

City of Lincoln - Fans of the hit BBC motoring TV show Top Gear may recall the episode in series 17 where then-presenters Jeremy Clarkson and James May appeared in Lincoln as part of their filming segment on electric cars. After their cars ran out of power near Brayford Waterfront they stopped at Lincolnshire County Council to find out where the nearest charging stations were but at the time there were no charging points for electric cars nearby. After they broke down near the marina by the University of Lincoln campus they recharged the cars through university windows and were seen trying to entertain themselves while the cars charged by eating lunch at the waterfront and visiting Lincoln Cathedral.

Belton House - Another popular manor house to be used for period drama is Belton House in Grantham which has been used for the 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice 2006's Jane Eyre and crime drama Bleak House.

Gainsborough Old Hall - The 2018 film Peterloo starring Maxine Peake and Rory Kinnear tells the story of the 1819 Peterloo Massacre where British forces attacked a peaceful pro-democracy rally in Manchester but did you know some of the filming actually took place at Gainsborough Old Hall? The English Heritage-owned stately home stood in for the streets of London in several scenes.

RAF Scampton and Hemswell - Of course the Dam Busters are on this list! RAF bases at Scampton and Hemswell were used for the filming of the 1955 film starring Richard Todd which told the story of The story of how the British attacked German dams in World War II by using an ingenious technique to drop bombs where they would be most effective.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on CSX’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.

View our latest analysis for CSX

What is CSX worth?

The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 13.86% above my intrinsic value which means if you buy CSX today you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $90.58 there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since CSX’s share price is quite volatile we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.

What kind of growth will CSX generate?

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 39% over the next couple of years the future seems bright for CSX. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock which should feed into a higher share valuation.

What this means for you:

Are you a shareholder? CSX’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price with shares trading around its fair value. However there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CSX now may not be the most advantageous time to buy given it is trading around its fair value. However the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

In light of this if you'd like to do more analysis on the company it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. You'd be interested to know that we found 2 warning signs for CSX and you'll want to know about these.

The age-old problem of completely stopped trains blocking major city thoroughfares is rearing its head again however.

Muncie's Deputy Mayor Richard Ivy has said this issue has become almost a daily inquiry to the city administration. The city has received over 50 complaints from numerous stakeholders in Muncie just at the start of the year.

""Angry people people saying it's not good city workers as well as fire and police"" Ivy said.

Issues are arising on many of the busiest roads through the city all of which are affected by east to west railroad lines. These include crossings crossings on McGalliard Road Tillotson Avenue Batavia Avenue Walnut Street and more that crisscross the city.

A network of trains causes headaches for drivers

When last reported in 2017 CSX Transportation said it moves around 20 trains and Norfolk Southern said it moves 25 trains through Muncie every day on a variety of tracks.

Those who try to avoid trains have to take the Madison Street underpass when trains block areas near downtown. Other routes can be used but you have to know the city streets well enough to know where the next unblocked crossing might be.

Even for lifelong residents that's not always easy.

Star Press archives:Frustrations mount over stopped trains but answers are few

Ivy said those not familiar with the city's roads especially truck drivers are left waiting at trains that sit at intersections. In 2019 The Star Press talked with residents who would wait at blocked intersections for upwards of an hour.

Not only are blocked intersections becoming an issue but Ivy said that residents are reporting the rail company is no longer following the quiet zone ordinance around the Washington Street area.

A few years ago when the hotel downtown was built city officials worked with the railroad companies in 2015 to implement a quiet zone.

That project cost roughly $5 million and closed several crossings to limit the amount of roads actually crossing the tracks. It should have eliminated a lot of the horn noise in the downtown area but the effort has been criticized ever since it took place because residents say train horns can still be heard.

More:Despite signs railroad company says no train increase

While stopped trains are a problem for commuters one of the biggest issues may be that trains can cause havoc for emergency service vehicles in some situations.

Paul Singleton director of the Delaware County 911 Emergency Operations Center said that trains stopped at intersections have become more of an issue lately.

It's something that's always concerning for dispatch as they try getting emergency services to people in the fastest possible manner.

“There has been an increase that we’ve noticed and I’ve noticed it personally too” Singleton said. “We make sure that first responders are aware that there is a train blocked.”

Singleton said that fortunately emergency services from police fire and EMS are on all sides of the tracks. It's a rarity that they have delays for emergency services but it does happen. The Star Press has reported several times when first responders were having to navigate around a stopped train on Tillotson Avenue to respond to emergencies.

“There is usually someone available where we might have an emergency” Singleton said.

Railroad oversight doesn't fall to local officials

Trains have been a problem examined by nearly every city administration since well before former mayor Dan Canon.

So what can be done?

Oversight of the rail lines falls to the federal government meaning there is little that even state officials can do to help with the situation. The deputy mayor through even more research has basically been told that there nothing the municipality can do on their own to regulate trains that cross the city.

""Our roads run across their train tracks not the other way around"" Ivy said.

In 2018 the Indiana Supreme Court struck down a state law that allowed municipalities to fine railroads when stopped trains blocked a street for longer than 10 minutes. The move was heavily criticized by former Muncie Mayor Dennis Tyler who faced mounting problems with stalled trains.

There just really isn't any power that city officials have to fix the issue. That said officials are hoping opening a dialogue again with the rail companies may help things improve.

""I'm open to anything that resolves it"" Ivy said. ""I don't know why Muncie has become so bad with this lately.”

Ivy said that the administration is supposed to have a meeting with Norfolk Southern in the coming week.

What do the rail companies have to say about the issue?

“Stopped trains especially at a crossing are a concern for Norfolk Southern across our entire network” Jeff DeGraff a representative with Norfolk Southern said. “We work hard to provide quality efficient service to our customers that are moving the freight that drives the economy and at the same time acknowledge the needs of the community.”

DeGraff said that trains like those in Muncie may be stopped for several reasons including mechanical issues congestion on tracks further ahead or it may be waiting for a train to pass in the opposite direction.

“Regardless we try to minimize the amount of time they are stopped while keeping the safety of our crew in mind” DeGraff added.

DeGraff said that if issues arise from multiple or repeated events they communicate and work with local officials to address the problems.

“As such we are meeting with city officials next week and look forward to discussing how we can minimize impacts to residents of the area” DeGraff said.

So what to do if your intersection remains blocked longer than 10 minutes? These are the phone numbers you might want in that sort of situation:

First off do not call 911. A blocked railroad crossing is not an emergency.

However you can call 765-747-4838 (the city non-emergency dispatch number) or 765-747-7878 (the county non-emergency dispatch number) to notify local authorities so that there can be a start to the communication between local dispatchers and railroad dispatchers. The following numbers may also be useful:

INDOT railroad services at 317-232-1491

INDOT customer service at 1-866-849-1368

Call the railroad company directly using the 1-800 number posted at the crossing (if you can see it of course)

CSX emergency number is 1-800-232-0144; CSX Transportation office is 904-359-3100

Norfolk Southern police at 800-946-4744

This is some pretty twisted fun.

YouTuber Westen Champlin has a penchant for big diesel trucks including semis. When he’s not playing with his many trucks the guy does even crazier things like swapping a Cummins diesel engine into a Ford Mustang. Just what kind of sick twisted cool individual is this guy? You really have to watch the video accompanying this article because words cannot completely describe this build.

The journey to building this Cummins-powered Mustang wasn’t an easy one something Champlin has documented for a while. Swapping the engine into the muscle car took some maneuvering but even with it installed there were some big issues like diesel pouring out of it like a civ. Yeah that shouldn’t be happening.

And just when Champlin thought he was out of the hoods the injectors started leaking. Honestly things could be so much worse with such a crazy build.

Anyway Champlin must be a pretty determined guy because along with his crew he soldiered on and fixed his weird Frankenstein pony car again and again until it now seems to run well enough. After all it does some pretty sick burnouts and who isn’t a fan of that? Plus it rolls coal with the best of them right out of a short stack from the engine bay. That’ll anger some people for sure.

With such a lightweight car packing all that diesel-powered torque this Mustang should absolutely destroy a set of tires in no time. Hopefully Champlin has a good tire guy because he’s going to need some solid discounts.

Funny enough this isn’t the first time we’ve seen a big truck engine dropped in a car with hilarious results. For example we covered a Nissan 240SX with a Nissan Titan V8 plus a massive supercharger swapped in. Needless to say there was no installing a hood on the car without cutting about 40% of it out and then what’s the point?

The tournament was cancelled amid a surge of COVID-19 cases in India and a shortage in hospital beds and oxygen supply.

Cases popped up in the IPL bio-bubbles as well leading to the season being postponed.

The actress told Self that she first experienced anxiety and depression in college: “It was just a generalized dark cloud over me.”



Bell 40 says she’s finding the right tools to help her through hard days.



Kristen Bell is no stranger to opening up about her mental health. But in the wake of the worst days of the COVID-19 pandemic when far too many of us experienced our own crises the actress is getting even more candid about her struggles stemming back decades—and how she’s coping with tough days.

Bell’s first experience with anxiety and depression came at age 18 when she left Michigan to study acting in New York City. “I wasn’t suicidal” the Frozen actress told Self but “it was just a generalized dark cloud over me. I felt like my real personality was in a tiny cage inside my body.”

“‘Why do I feel terrible and exhausted every day?’” Bell 40 recalls asking herself back then.



Bell’s mother a registered nurse helped her out of that initial spiral The Good Place actress explains pushing her to try SSRI medication and revealing a family history of anxiety and depression. Another lifeline was walking; Bell would take long strolls around the city to clear her mind.

Those simple solutions—medication and exercise plus a few extra mindfulness hacks she picked up along the way—helped the actress find her way from unknown college student to household name. “I am someone who has to check myself” Bell told Today in 2019. “Sometimes if I’m feeling really low [I] make a checklist of good and bad things in my life to see if it’s my mental state or if we really have a problem.”

“I know that I present someone who is very bubbly and happy all the time and a lot of the time I am because I have really good tools” Bell continued in her Self interview. But when COVID-19 hit she found herself in a “mental zone that wasn’t healthy for my family to be around.”

This time it was her husband Dax Shephard who helped her find a way through: “‘Are you helping anyone right now by sitting and crying in your bed or are you just being self-indulgent?’” Bell remembers him saying. “‘Either get up and donate money or donate your time’” he said or “‘come out here and be a good mom and a good wife and a good friend and live your life in honor of the suffering that happens in the world.’”

She was outraged at first but realized the truth behind her husband’s words prompting her to help their daughters Lincoln 8 and Delta 6 navigate the stresses of the pandemic too. The actress also picked up new penchants for knitting and completing puzzles during the past year she noted which offer moments of peace in an otherwise busy family schedule.

Quarantine also took a toll on Bell and Shepard’s marriage: “This is as physically close as we’ve been in a couple of days because we’ve just found each other revolting” she said with a laugh during an Instagram Live interview last April. But thanks in part to couples therapy and some brutal honesty about their lives—Shepard even revealed that Bell “saved” his life when he relapsed last summer—they’re still going strong.

For now Bell is working to make sure that her fans know they aren’t alone in grappling with their mental health. “I still have this desire this knee-jerk to present perfection” she explained to Self. But she feels she has “a responsibility … to try and make the world a safer better place for other human beings.”

Around 300 seniors over the age of 62 who live in six HUD Section 202 communities will receive COVID-19 vaccinations Jan. 11 as part of the initial Phase 1A priority group. Walgreens will vaccinate residents staff and volunteers at the AHEPA 78 Senior Apartments at West 79th Street and on Madison Street in Merrillville.

“The vaccine is to be celebrated and we appreciate the federal government for making affordable elderly housing communities a priority in the initial phase of distribution"" said AHEPA Affordable Housing Management Co. President and CEO Steve Beck. ""We have collaborated with these pharmacies to ensure we are prepared properly for the distribution of the vaccine in our communities based upon Indiana’s order of prioritization to help protect one of our nation’s most vulnerable populations and to limit the virus’s spread.""

AHEPA Senior Apartments offer low-income seniors including many married couplets independent apartment home living with voluntary support services such as meals transportation assistance enrollment assistance for public benefit programs help with housekeeping health care fitness programs and case management that can be ramped up as they age.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is partnering with Walgreens CVS and Managed Health Case Associates Inc. to distribute the vaccine against the coronavirus that's killed more than 1.8 million people worldwide including more than 350000 Americans to such facilities at no cost.

""COVID fatigue is real. I am proud of our personnel who ensured our residents continued to have safe access to the vital supportive services they need to live independently during this pandemic"" Beck said. ""It is a testament to their training and experience in the field.”

More than 60 seniors and about a dozen staff members signed up for the voluntary shots in two of the six apartment buildings said Joyce Dunson resident service coordinator. She did not know how many total signed up but estimated it likely would be in the hundreds.

""We're going to keep it simple and give them their shot at their apartment door before moving onto the next floor"" she said. ""Not everyone's going to get it but they will have a second chance when they come back for the booster shot in 28 days and when they come back for a flu shot. The response has been good. They have a lot pulling at them from different sides: television written social media family in their ear. They're making decisions based on all of these factors.""

AHEPA Senior Apartments has been giving them a lot of information about the importance of a vaccine.

""They're getting information from trusted sources placed on their doors on a weekly basis"" she said. ""We're not pressuring anyone. It is an important decision and we feel more people will do it next time after they've talked to their neighbors. Some folks are excited about the prospect. They feel it's going to give them a freedom to see their grandchildren. That's a big thing. Many have been coping with isolation issues with the pandemic and they are excited this will give them the freedom to do the things they have been doing in the past.""

Walgreens and CVS have been vaccinating residents at nursing homes across Northwest Indiana. Community Hospital in Munster Methodist Hospitals in Merrillville and Gary and Franciscan Hospitals in Hammond Crown Point and Michigan City also have vaccinated thousands of health care workers in the Region.

COLUMBUS Ohio (AP) — Rado Parapunov had 13 kills seven digs two blocks and three aces and Hawaii won its first national championship in men’s volleyball with a dominating 25-21 25-19 25-16 victory over BYU on Saturday night.

Parapunov was named the most outstanding player after his 18th straight match this season with double-digit kills.

“It's about the heart it's about your teammates it's about doing your best it's never about stats"" Parapunov said. “It's about this right here (trophy). I lost it once and second time thankfully I got it.”

The top-seeded Rainbow Warriors (17-1) didn't lose a set during the NCAA Tournament.

Parapunov had five kills in the first set and freshman Chaz Galloway added three. Hawaii was never challenged in the second set going on a 6-0 run and jumping out to a 16-8 lead.

Hawaii kept it going in the third building a 11-5 advantage and finishing with 41 kills 10 aces and just 11 service errors while hitting .381.

It has been ranked 53rd in the list of Global Powers of Retailing improvement from 56th earlier according to the Deloitte report.

The list is topped by US giant Walmart Inc which retains its position as world's top retailer. Amazon.com Inc improved its position to rank second. Costco Wholesale Corporation of US slipped a rank to be placed third followed by Schwarz Group of Germany.

The top 10 has seven US retailers and one from the UK (Tesco PLC at 10th position). Other US retailers in the top 10 include The Kroger Co (ranked 5th) Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (6th) and CVS Health Corporation (ranked 9th). Germany's Aldi Einkauf GmbH & Co. oHG and Aldi International Services GmbH & Co. oHG is placed at 8th position.

Reliance Retail is the only Indian entry in the global list of 250 retailers. It features consecutively for the 4th time in the list of Global Powers of Retailing and World's Fastest Retailers.

""Reliance Retail last year's Fastest 50 leader dropped to second place. The company recorded YoY growth of 41.8 per cent driven primarily by a 13.1 per cent increase in the number of stores in its consumer electronics fashion and lifestyle and grocery retail chains to 11784 stores across 7000+ towns and cities in India at fiscal year end (FY20)"" Deoitte said.

E-commerce it said is a second growth driver through both digital commerce (B2C) and B2B.

""The company is partnering with WhatsApp to further accelerate Reliance Retail's digital commerce business on the JioMart platform using WhatsApp and to support small businesses on WhatsApp"" it said. ""Reliance Retail acquired the 29 stores of Shri Kannan Departmental Store at the end of FY2019 and in August 2020 announced it would acquire Future Group's retail wholesale and logistics units for USD 3.4 billion.""



When fully approved the deal will almost double Reliance Retail's store space.

Reliance Retail also made two e-commerce acquisitions in 2020 buying Vitalic Health and its online pharmacy platform Netmeds in August and a 96 per cent stake in online home decor company UrbanLadder in November.

On global outlook Deloitte said in the early months of 2021 the world was faced with both promise and peril.

""On the positive side the distribution of vaccines for COVID-19 was under way offering the promise that sometime later in the year the negative impact of the virus could abate significantly. On the negative side the virus continued to threaten economic stability especially in those parts of the world where it was still prevalent and threatened to be a problem elsewhere if new and virulent strains of the virus were spread widely"".

Even in places where the outbreak was limited there was a negative economic impact from social distancing measures to avoid a further outbreak it said adding the challenge for policymakers was to control the current outbreak protect those who have been disrupted by it and speed up the distribution of approved vaccines.

The speed and success of these three imperatives will determine the path of the global economy in the year ahead it added."

The family-owned business stayed in the same location at the corner of Trapp Road and Route 235 for almost 90 years.

In that time it grew from an auto service center to a business specializing in agriculture lawn and garden compact industrial equipment marine engines parts sales and service.

Forced to Shut Doors

Unfortunately after decades as a John Deere dealer they were forced to temporarily close the doors of this family business in 2020.

Back In Business

But Rick’s daughter Andrea Carroll wasn’t going to let her family legacy go. She reopened the business under the name Carroll’s Service Center a short time later.

Andrea started working at the family business as a kid and joined the company full time when she finished college. At first the re-opened Carroll’s concentrated mainly on servicing equipment but as time went on they’ve been able to add new lines of equipment.

Currently they are a STIHL dealer and have recently added Gravely’s line of zero-turn mowers. “The residential models are built with some of the same high-quality features as the commercial models. Easy to learn and operate zero-turn mowers help you achieve shorter mowing times use less fuel and cover more ground over the course of the machine’s lifetime.”

Andrea hopes to carry Yanmar tractors and UTVs soon.

Moving Forward

She says Carroll’s can service all brands of equipment including John Deere.

“Now we work on all brands of equipment. We do tubes tires hydraulic lines and more. We’re a one-stop shop. Along with my dedicated and hardworking staff I am excited to grow and continue to support the tri-county area for all their equipment needs.”

Right now her top goal is to let Southern Maryland know that Carroll’s is here to stay. “We’re still trying to get the word out that we’re open again.”

This fourth-generation business owner says Carroll’s strives to offer superior customer service. “We care about our customers. Our number one goal is to make them happy. That’s always been our motto. You don’t get that in a big box store. We want to find the right equipment to meet your needs.”

Stop by and see Andrea at 17723 Three Notch Rd in Dameron Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday from 9 a.m. to noon.

Delta Air Lines and United Airlines have added flights to the three mainstream European countries open to Americans: Iceland Croatia and Greece.

All three countries are welcoming US tourists with proof of vaccination with some also allowing for just a negative COVID-19 test.

American Airlines hasn't been as nimble focusing more on South America and only launching flights to Greece and Israel for the summer.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Europe is once again just a flight away for many Americans.

US airlines were quick to adjust their route maps when coronavirus pandemic travel patterns shifted towards domestic destinations. And with Europe gradually opening up to American tourists airlines are making similar adjustments to accommodate the international jet set.

Delta Air Lines announced its latest international route between New York and Dubrovnik Croatia scheduled to start on July 2. Flights will operate four-times-weekly with departures from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on Tuesdays Thursdays Fridays and Saturdays and return flights from Dubrovnik Airport on Wednesdays Fridays Saturdays and Sundays.

It's Delta's first and only route to the Southern European country which has seen newfound interest from Americans as vaccinated travelers as well as those presenting a negative COVID-19 test or proof of recovery will be able to enter the country. Croatia is situated on the Adriatic Sea and boasts countless historical towns and villages on its over 1000 miles of coastline.

United Airlines will also serve Croatia with flights between Newark and Dubrovnik launching on July 8. The three-times-weekly flights from Newark Liberty International Airport depart on Mondays Thursdays and Saturdays and return from Dubrovnik Airport on Sundays Tuesdays and Fridays.

Both airlines will use Boeing 767-300ER wide-body aircraft on their respective routes to Dubrovnik.

Croatia also borders Montenegro another European country open to vaccinated Americans according to the US Embassy in Montenegro. Dubrovnik itself is only 25 miles from the border with Montenegro and US citizens need only present proof of recent vaccination or recovery or a negative COVID-19 test less than 72 hours old when entering.

Delta and United have been the most eager to serve the reopening European continent and have also launched flights to Iceland and Greece the two other mainstream European tourist countries opening to Americans.

Iceland will be served by United this summer from Newark starting June 3 and Chicago starting July 1. Delta serves the Land of Fire and Ice via Reykjavik from New York and begins flights from Boston and Minneapolis on May 20 and May 27 respectively.

Greece also welcoming vaccinated Americans or those with a negative COVID-19 test is also served by the two airlines.

United will fly to Athens from Washington DC starting July 1 and resume its Newark-Athens route on June 3. Delta will similarly resume its New York-Athens route on May 28 and launch a new route between Athens and Atlanta starting July 2.

American Airlines has been less nimble than its competitors on Europe's reopening focusing instead on the Americas. Some additions east of the Prime Meridian have been the New York-Athens route starting on June 3 Miami-Tel Aviv route starting on June 4 and New York-Tel Aviv route that launched on May 6.







While Greece is opening its doors to all vaccinated or COVID-19-negative Americans however Israel is being more restrictive with its opening and is only slated to welcome vaccinated group tours on May 23 but not individual tourists yet.

South America has been American's main focus with new flights to cities in Chile Colombia and Brazil starting this year. American has not yet relaunched flights to Iceland or Croatia despite serving both countries prior to the pandemic.

But American could soon shift to Europe as more countries welcome US citizens. For now airlines can rejoice that European route launches are once again common after more than a year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL2RlbHRhLWR1YnJvdm5pay1mbGlnaHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Adds New Service To Croatia Greece And Iceland,"Delta Air Lines announced new seasonal summer service to Croatia on Friday.

New Delta Flight To Dubrovnik Croatia

In April United Airlines announced it would add service to Athens (Greece) Dubrovnik (Croatia) and Reykjavik (Iceland) this summer three nations which are now open to Americans.

Days later Delta followed by introducing expanded service to Iceland and Athens. Now Delta has decided to challenge United directly on the Dubrovnik route with its own service from New York.

The flight will operate three days per week from New York (JFK) to Dubrovnik (DBV):

Route Flight Dep Arr Operating Days JFK-DBV 184 7:30 p.m. 10:45 a.m. Tue/Thu/Fri/Sat DBV-JFK 185 1:00 p.m. 5:15 p.m. Wed/Fri/Sat/Sun

Delta will utilize a Boeing 767-300 on the route with 226 seats including:

26 Delta One (business class)

35 Comfort+ (extra-legroom)

165 Economy class

United is also using a 767-300 on the route and operating three times per week. Delta notes that if the route is successful it may continue it into the autumn schedule.

In addition to the new Dubrovnik route Delta will increase service to Iceland and Greece.

New Delta Service To Athens Greece

On May 28th Delta will resume its annual service from New York (JFK) to Athens (ATH) suspended since 2019. But Delta has also announced new service from Atlanta (ATL) to Athens on July 2nd. Delta will use an Airbus A330-300 on both Athens route with 293 seats including:

34 Delta One pods (business class)

40 Comfort+ seats (extra legroom economy class)

219 Economy class

The new Atlanta flight will operate according to the following schedule:

Route Flight Dep Arr Operating Days ATL-ATH 222 4:25 p.m. 10:00 a.m. Daily ATH-ATL 223 12:20 p.m. 5:35 p.m. Daily

Expanded Delta Service To Reykjavik Iceland

Finally Delta will operate service to Reykjavik Iceland (KEF) from three routes including:

Boston (BOS)

Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP)

New York (JFK)

Delta will use a 767-300 on the JFK route and a 757-200 on the Boston and Minneapolis route. The JFK service will feature lie-flat beds in business class while the BOS and MSP service will utilize a “domestic” 757-200 that has only “Premium Select” recliners (the sort of seats you can expect in first class on most Delta domestic flights).

The routes will operate according to the following schedule:

Boston (BOS) – Reykjavik (KEF) Schedule On Delta

Route Flight Dep Arr Operating Days BOS-KEF 266 10:25 p.m. 7:45 a.m. Daily KEF-BOS 267 10:15 a.m. 12:00 p.m. Daily

Minneapolis (MSP) – Reykjavik (KEF) Schedule On Delta

Route Flight Dep Arr Operating Days MSP-KEF 260 7:30 p.m. 6:40 a.m. Daily KEF-MSP 261 9:30 a.m. 11:00 a.m. Daily

New York (JFK) – Reykjavik (KEF) Schedule On Delta:

Route Flight Dep Arr Operating Days JFK-KEF 246 10:25 p.m. 8:05 a.m. Daily KEF-JFK 247 11:15 a.m. 1:15 p.m. Daily

Will American Airlines Match?

American Airlines is the only U.S. carrier that has actually served Dubrovnik but it has not announced service yet. Meanwhile AA will operate service between Philadelphia (PHL) and Reykjavik (KEF) and launch service between New York (JFK) and Athens (ATH) this summer.

CONCLUSION

The summer transatlantic market is heating up with Delta bolstering service to countries where Americans can travel with proof of vaccination or negative PCR test. Tickets for Delta’s new Dubrovnik flight go on sale today.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlbHRhLWJvc3Rvbi1saWUtZmxhdC13YXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta retaliates against American JetBlue with more lie-flats to LA,"The lie-flat wars are heating up.

Over the weekend Delta Air Lines made a notable schedule update for its transcon route between Boston (BOS) and Los Angeles (LAX). Beginning on July 7 the carrier will deploy a Boeing 757-200 on the 2611-mile cross-country jaunt instead of the previously scheduled Boeing 737-800 confirmed by Cirium schedules and the carrier's website.

Delta didn't change the route's frequency — it's still up to four times daily — but the aircraft swap spells great news for those sitting in the pointy end of the plane.

That's because Delta's internationally configured Boeing 757 sports 16 lie-flat business-class pods arranged in a 2-2 configuration compared to the standard domestic first-class recliners that the previously scheduled 737 offers.

In addition to lie-flat biz the 757 is outfitted with 44 extra-legroom Comfort+ seats as well as 108 standard coach ones in a 3-3 arrangement.

Along with the upgauge Delta will market the service as one of its signature Delta One transcon routes.

If the current schedule sticks — anything can change especially due to the pandemic — it'd mean that every Delta transcon from BOS to LAX would be outfitted with a true biz cabin.

That's quite the break from Delta's thinking roughly a month ago. In mid-April Delta pulled all the Boeing 757s from the BOS-LAX route and replaced them with 737s. The Atlanta-based carrier explained to TPG that demand didn't warrant lie-flats but Delta was ""in a position to adjust quickly to demand"" if and when it returns.

Now four weeks later it would appear that demand for the fancy biz seats is expected to return come the summer. But that might not be Delta's only motivation to upgauge the route so quickly.

Two weeks after Delta pulled lie-flats between BOS and LAX American Airlines and JetBlue announced another slew of new routes and increased coordination as part of the Northeast Alliance which includes — as you might've guessed — service between Boston and Los Angeles.

On April 21 American announced that it'll deploy its premium-heavy Airbus A321T on the aforementioned route beginning on Nov. 2. The plane outfitted with just 102 seats is arranged in a three-cabin configuration with 10 first-class pods 20 business-class lie-flat beds and 72 coach seats half of which are designated as extra-legroom Main Cabin Extra.

More Northeast Alliance: 7 key takeaways as American JetBlue expand again in Northeast

As AA and JetBlue cozy up they're planning to offer a premium transcon experience and metal neutrality on the routes between New York and Boston and both Los Angeles (LAX) and San Francisco (SFO). JetBlue will fly its Mint-equipped Airbus A321s and American will use its Airbus A321T.

Now with Delta deploying a 757 on the route the carriers will go head-to-head to capture the premium demand for flights between the coasts.

United on the other hand hasn't (yet) responded to the competition. The Chicago-based carrier is still planning to fly Boeing 737s between BOS and LAX though the BOS to SFO route is slated to be upgraded to a lie-flat equipped Boeing 757 on Aug. 1.

Boston isn't the only city in the Northeast corridor feeling the Delta love. Flyers traveling from Washington D.C. to Los Angeles are also in for an upgrade.

As part of the latest schedule update Delta will fly its internationally configured Boeing 757-200 between Washington Reagan National (DCA) and LAX on its one daily frequency beginning on July 7."

A Brazilian reader of 9to5Mac was sent a survey enquiring about Apple Watch health-tracking habits and asking which of the current watchOS features are the most useful. The survey then went on to ask respondents whether they use third-party apps to track workouts track and eating habits and crucially whether they use apps to monitor medications and blood sugar levels.

It’s more evidence that the company’s long-running ambition to launch an Apple Watch with built-in non-invasive blood glucose monitoring is close to being fulfilled. While an Apple survey isn’t cast-iron proof as such they have often signalled the way the company will imminently turn as anybody who received the survey about old iPhone chargers will know.

The Holy Grail of health tracking

Blood glucose tracking has been a target for Apple for years and CEO Tim Cook was even seen wearing what appeared to be a prototype device way back in 2017.

The long road to it becoming a feature is a reflection of both how difficult the challenge is and the importance of getting it right. While blood sugar levels are a useful metric for people looking to lose weight for diabetics the knowledge is of paramount importance and a flakey inaccurate sensor just wouldn’t do.

But if the implementation is done right it could be a game changer — not least because the current medical-grade hardware is so expensive. As we explained last year some third-party hardware is compatible with Apple Watch but it’s extremely expensive. A continuous monitoring system such as Dexcom costs $245 for transmitters and $1035 for a three-month supply of sensors and even a cheaper manual system like One Drop costs between $31 and $90 a month depending on how many daily tests you administer.

Last week rumors of Apple’s plans became even stronger when it was revealed that the company was the biggest customer of Rockley Photonics a U.K. business that specializes in accurate sensors for various blood signals including glucose and alcohol levels. In its SEC documents Rockley claims that its lasers offer “up to 1000000 times higher resolution 1000 times higher accuracy and 100 times broader range in wavelengths” than existing wearable LEDs.

That all sounds very promising but the big question is whether this implementation will make the Apple Watch 7 or whether it won't arrive until the 2022 version of the wearable. Rockley CEO Andrew Rickman said he expected the technology to be in wearables next year which certainly makes it sound like an Apple Watch 8 thing.

But that’s not to say that Apple won’t have something in place for the Apple Watch 7. It wouldn’t be the first time the company had introduced a basic feature and then improved it over subsequent generations after all.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It was wiped out in 2016 by sea-level rise. (Credit: Ian Bell/EHP/State of Queensland/Wikimedia Commons)

This article appeared in the June 2021 issue of Discover magazine as ""Do We Really Need to Protect Every Species?"" Become a subscriber to support our science journalism.

Extinctions of species occurred long before humans arrived on Earth. By that definition it’s a natural process. But today extinctions are increasing rapidly — and very often linked to human activities. Take the Bramble Cay melomys a small rodent on a remote island uninhabited by humans. In 2016 it became the first mammal to be erased from the planet due to climate change. Some conservationists mourned but others questioned whether every extinction is something to worry about.

In the face of tough decisions about human lifestyles and the climate crisis a split among scientists is surfacing. Losing one species may not change life as we know it so perhaps our limited conservation resources should focus on preserving the biodiversity in those systems where it benefits humans. Sometimes such as when dense forests prevent landslides a great diversity of species isn’t needed to perform this function. Essentially we must ask the question: How should we value life?

The Claim: Protect Ecosystems Not Species

Peter Kareiva: President and CEO of the Aquarium of the Pacific (Credit: Andrew Reitsma/Aquarium of the Pacific)

For Peter Kareiva the president and CEO of the Aquarium of the Pacific the term biodiversity crisis wrongly inflates the role of individual nonhuman species in human well-being and prosperity when in reality holistic ecosystems are more important. A marshland th

at stifles tidal waves may not need 16 different species of shellfish to hold it together. It’s a “dramatic extrapolation” he says to conclude that the extinction of one species would imperil the coastline and thus human well-being.

Kareiva adheres to a metaphor developed by biologist Paul Ehrlich: Nature is like an airplane and species are the rivets that hold it together. Without a few rivets a plane can still fly but if you take too many out the plane will fall apart and crash. The trouble is Kareiva says we don’t know how many rivets we can take out. Instead of trying to nail down that number we would be better served focusing on an ecosystem’s functions — that is keeping the plane in the sky rather than saving every rivet. “The first question you ask is if this species goes functionally extinct what will be different about the world?”

A scientist’s role he says should be to answer that question as the evidence society uses to decide whether a species needs to be saved. Some conservation biologists however have turned into activists when instead it is up to society to weigh social and cultural values against what it would take to protect a species. Often that means deciding whether to spend hard-to-find money in conservation or elsewhere.

The Counterpoint: Morals Matter

Tierra Curry: Scientist and Activist with the Center for Biological Diversity (Credit: Center for Biological Diversity)

Tierra Curry is both a scientist and activist with the Center for Biological Diversity and she’s well acquainted with the nonprofit cash crunch. Sometimes she feels pushed to concentrate efforts on protecting a more famous species like the monarch butterfly rather than the seemingly mundane freshwater mussels in the art that line her walls.

A focus on preserving ecosystem services can often bolster financial support but for her allowing a species to go extinct is wrong. The funding exists for conservation but we choose not to use it. “Extinction is a political choice” she says. “ ‘We only have $100 million what can we save?’ That’s not the question. The question is ‘How do we get a billion dollars?’ ”

Valuing the natural world in terms of how each individual species benefits humans may be too narrow a view Curry says. “We’re not always looking at the right metrics.” For instance genetic diversity can make ecosystems resilient in the face of drastic changes like climate change and disease she notes. A single invasive species may replace native species and accomplish an ecosystem function in the short term but a disease would more easily wipe it out in the future.

Diversity also brings honest allure Curry says. “It’s the box of 128 crayons versus the box of eight crayons. No kid wants the box of eight crayons on the first day of school when they could have the box of 128 crayons.”

Curry’s main motivation however is morality. Mass global extinctions have happened five times before but humans have the capacity to understand that we are causing this one. “Because we know” she says “I think we have the moral responsibility to take care of our fellow earthlings.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

It's difficult to tell which supermarket chain takes the top spot in the market. Cub says it is at the top of a Nielsen market survey. Target edged out Cub according to Chain Store Guide which measures market share in a different way.

Regardless of who's No. 1 the race for market share shows no sign of slowing. ""There's more money chasing grocery now because of its success during the pandemic"" said C.E. Pugh chief executive of National Co-op Grocers.

As stay-at-home restrictions took hold restaurants in Minnesota could only offer takeout and even when restrictions eased they had to follow social-distance guidelines. Plus the work-from-home era opened by necessity.

As a result supermarkets saw big gains. U.S. grocery sales increased 10% last year according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

""That's a phenomenal increase"" said Burt Flickinger managing director of Strategic Resource Group in New York. ""Normally it's 1 to 2% growth.""

Now grocery stores are flush with cash ready to expand or upgrade to keep customers coming back whether it's in person or through online orders.

And the Twin Cities supermarket battle has heated up again.

The new ballgame includes Target and Walmart as stronger competitors after the pandemic; dollar stores and drugstores eating up a share of the market; and Costco and Aldi as more than ""alternative"" grocers.

""They are no longer the 'alternative' but rather the largest and most well-capitalized grocery incumbents in many markets"" said Scott Moses managing director at PJ Solomon.

Since the 1990s Cub Foods has dominated the Twin Cities market at its peak holding a 40% market share. But Target Walmart Costco and newer competitors such as Hy-Vee and Fresh Thyme are eating into that share the surveys show.

In fact a dozen stores get enough sales to show up on the market surveys from the local Lunds & Byerlys and Kowalski's to Trader Joe's.

Chain Store Guide — which among its measures are total purchases made giving megastores such as Target and Walmart the advantage — gave Target an 18.3% market share. Cub including its franchisees such as Jerry's Foods had 18.1%.

A broader look from Metro Market Studies in Tucson Ariz. gives Cub a 25.7% market share with Walmart at 18.8% and Target at 8.8%. Metro Market compiles data from Chain Store Guide Nielsen Progressive Grocer union store records and public company reports.

Target declined to talk about its market-share data.

Cub said Nielsen is the industry standard and at the end of 2020 it ranked the chain No. 1 in the Twin Cities market.

""Market share can be subjective and results can differ depending on the survey's methodology such as what types of products to include and the physical boundaries grocery stores need to be located within"" said Darren Caudill the chain's vice president of sales in an e-mail.

Cub has stayed competitive despite being on the market. Its old parent company Supervalu was acquired in 2018 by United Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI). Immediately UNFI said it wanted to sell the corporate-owned Cub stores but so far has not found a buyer.

Since then Cub sales have improved under new leadership said Flickinger the supermarket analyst. Yet major players have jump-started expansion plans that were mostly delayed during the early part of the pandemic adding even more pressure for the Cub chain. More than a dozen stores should be added to the market by 2022.

Hy-Vee plans to open three new stores by fall. Lunds & Byerlys is opening one store in Minneapolis' Nokomis neighborhood on May 20 and another in Apple Valley in 2023. It also will expand a store this year and next. If Aldi follows through with plans to add three or four Twin Cities locations by the end of 2022 it will surpass Cub's 78-store volume for the first time.

The rebuilt E. Lake Street Target store in Minneapolis.

While Costco hasn't announced any more stores nationally it has looked at shuttered Macy's Herberger's and Bon-Tons as possible new locations Flickinger said. The company generating the most buzz — Amazon — isn't saying a word. Building on its online Amazon Fresh food delivery the company has been opening up physical stores with the same name building on its Whole Foods business. Bloomberg reported that new Fresh stores will carry Amazon's newest technology making some of them cashierless by tracking purchases as shoppers move around the store.

Unnamed grocery stores being developed in Eagan Burnsville Coon Rapids and Arden Hills could be Fresh stores according to reports. An Amazon spokeswoman says any reports are ""rumor and speculation"" at this point.

If Amazon Fresh does enter the Twin Cities market analysts expect it to be a game changer.

""Amazon is the best capitalized retailer in the world. Its market value is worth more than all the other grocers combined including Walmart Target Costco CVS Walgreens Dollar General Kroger and Albertsons"" said Moses of PJ Solomon. ""Mathematically it has the ability to make much larger truly extraordinary investments in price wages advertising and technology.""

Amazon Fresh stores have already opened in California and Illinois and nearly 30 more are in the works.

""We'll see a lot of these stores pop up quickly"" said Phil Lempert retail food analyst and founder of Supermarketguru.com. The stores average 30000 to 40000 square feet smaller than a Cub but larger than an Aldi.

""Every competitor is vulnerable from traditional stores to supercenters like Walmart"" he said. Still Lempert said that after Amazon's newness wore off in the California market many shoppers returned to their former favorites such as Ralph's.

Retailers from co-ops and to Target Lunds & Byerlys Kowalski's Coborn's and Cub are counting on consumers' buy-local commitments that have grown since the pandemic.

""We learned how to compete with Walmart and we'll do the same with Amazon"" said Pugh the National Co-op Grocers' CEO.

If Amazon expands its grocery footprint in the Twin Cities grocers' online and delivery innovations developed during the pandemic will need to continue and improve. Online grocery ordering moved from 3 to 10% last year and is expected to climb further according to Supermarket News. Most consumers chose to pick up their online orders in store but they spent more when the order was delivered according to 1010 Data in New York.

As a result of the changes during the pandemic Target accelerated plans to roll out fresh and frozen grocery items for order pickup and delivery and it has paid off said Rick Gomez Target's chief food and beverage officer.

""Guests who first shopped for fresh and frozen food items through order pickup and drive-up last year made about one extra trip each month and increased their spending between 20 and 30 percent"" on food and beverage items he said.

A continuation of pre-pandemic trends of updated produce and prepared foods sections will continue in the coming years as well said Greg Houck associate principal at Cuningham Group Architecture in Minneapolis which works with supermarkets on store design.

Even the once popular salad bar is being reimagined since the pandemic.

""We've had to ask ourselves if the consumer will be apprehensive about open food bars"" said Chief Executive Tres Lund of Lunds & Byerlys. ""We're looking at side greens and side proteins being repackaged differently.""

While supermarket retailers expect 2020's pantry loading could slow sales again in the packaged goods aisles most analysts believe the changes both by grocers and in how people work — and a rediscovery of cooking — will make 2021 another good year for grocers.

The horse came from a humble background and sold for a mere $1000 as a yearling.

Breeder Gail Rice used to whisper in his ears that he would be a champion.

Two old friends got reacquainted with a kiss last Sunday morning. One was the 59-year-old blonde from Ocala.

The other was a 3-year-old horse who usually isn't into such things.

""They were surprised he let me do that"" Gail Rice said. ""But I used to grab him by the face and kiss him when he was a baby.""

He is Medina Spirit. Talk about a local boy made good the pony won the Kentucky Derby last Saturday afternoon.

It came with a blanket of roses a $1.86 million payout and a charming back story.

""It's crazy totally crazy"" Rice said. ""This should be a movie.""

This time-worn plot never gets old. An underdog from the wrong side of the tracks comes out of nowhere to win the world's most famous race.

In this case the tracks were about 10 miles north of Ocala in Sparr (population: one Subway one Dollar General). The heroine would be the vivacious Rice who is suddenly flying high as one of the world's greatest matchmakers.

""I'm not going to walk on the ground for a long time"" she said.

She's the breeder who literally brought Medina Spirit into the world. The film's opening scene might take place when Rice was a little girl in Lebanon Pennsylvania and first climbed on a pony.

She promptly fell off.

""I was scared of horses after that"" Rice said.

About 15 years later she married into the horse business. Her husband Wayne was a jockey. They eventually moved to Florida and started raising three kids and a bunch of horses.

Breeding horses is almost a total crapshoot. Rice spends weeks studying bloodlines and racing forms. But after all the raw analysis a gut feeling still has its place.

""You listen to God and listen to a little voice"" Rice said. ""Then — BAM! — here's the one!""

That little voice has to take money into consideration. Stud fees can run far into six figures but Rice didn't run a high-falutin' operation.

The price tag for Medina Spirit's mother Mongolian Changa was $9000. Rice bred her to a stallion named Prontonico partially because the stud fee was only $6500.

Nobody saw the BAM! coming.

Rice knew Mongolian Changa was pregnant but it was the horse's first foal. She didn't swell much or develop a milk sack. Rice went into the barn on April 5 2018 and saw Mongolian Changa lying on her side.

""I saw these little feet trying to poke through"" she said.

Rice and her daughter former jockey Taylor Rice wrestled the baby out. It didn't take long for them to notice how smoothly the new addition galloped. He had the confidence to venture away from his mother in the pasture. And he didn't like to be out-run by any other horse.

""You're going to be a champion"" Rice would whisper in his ear. ""You're going to be a superstar.""

Rice and her husband were divorcing and she had to cut expenses. She put the un-named yearling up for auction at the 2019 Ocala Breeders Sales hoping to get $10000.

It drew the minimum bid — $1000.

""Nobody wanted him"" Rice said.

The winner was Christy Whitman a ""pinhooker"" who tries to find overlooked undervalued horses and re-sell them. She told Rice she'd offer the colt at the 2-year-old sale the next year.

That's where he was spotted by a scout for Amr Zedan a Saudi tycoon and professional polo player who thinks nothing of paying $1 million for a potential stakes winner. Zedan got this one for $35000 and named him after the holy city of Medina.

I think ""Sparr Spirit"" would have been more appropriate but I didn't have 35 grand to spare on a horse last year.

And unlike Zedan I couldn't afford to hire Bob Baffert. The legendary trainer noticed the dark bay colt from Florida would outrun the high-dollar horses he was training.

Medina Spirit was competitive in four stakes races this spring but nobody thought the blue-collar colt would win the Derby.

Nobody except Rice.

She'd been to only one Kentucky Derby before and got a ticket this year through her daughter's jockey connections. Rice went to Macy's at the Paddock Mall and got a black white and pink pattern dress suitable for Derby Day. A friend loaned her a fancy hat.

Medina Spirit was a 12-1 underdog but he took an early lead and held it to the top of the home stretch. In the movie this would be where they dub the words Rice used to whisper in the colt's ear.

""You're a champion. You're going to be a superstar.""

Medina Spirit held off three horses to win by a half-length.

""That little horse is all guts” Baffert said. “His heart is bigger than his body.”

It was Baffert's record-setting seventh Derby win. Medina Spirit also became the seventh Florida-bred horse to win the big one at Churchill Downs.

Rice didn't have a credential to get into the winner's circle but she barged through with the owner's entourage hollering to security guards ""I raised that horse! I pulled him out of his mother!""

Rice hopes the win will spur a few Zedan types to ask for her breeding advice. But for now she has more pressing concerns.

The Preakness is Saturday and an NBC crew is coming to town to interview her. And Rice has to find another outfit for the day at Pimlico Race Course.

""I can't wear the same dress"" she laughed.

Rice thinks Medina Spirit might have an even faster gear than he showed at Churchill Downs. If he does he could become only the second Florida-bred horse to win the Triple Crown.

But even if he never wins again Rice's movie has its final scene.

Her baby the $1000 yearling nobody wanted won the Kentucky Derby. And Rice's feet may never touch the ground.

chuckdawg1999 wrote: Authentics Barricade is probably the best Bravo Class figure I've handled. The transformation is solid and while the joints are a little looser than I prefer the figure isn't a floppy mess. Definitely worth the purchase.



At the tail end of April several fans found the new Authentics bravo class Barricade in the US at Dollar General. That's been the main place to buy these toys. If you saw him and were wondering if he was good well fellow Seibertronian Chuckdawg made a review. This Barricade is based on the evergreen design which adapts the TLK movie design into a more ""G1"" style.

Stylistically it shares a lot with the Cyber Battalion Shockwave from a few years ago while borrowing from the Cyberverse aesthetic and adding some nice touches like knee articulation. While not the best figure from the Authentics line it's a solid entry and worth the purchase.





Once again fellow Seibertronian Chuckdawg takes a bullet for us by buying the latest authentic figure Shockwave to let us know if he is worth looking into. Turns out he is pretty good for a cheaper figure aimed at younger fans. Posted by william-james88 on May 31st 2021 @ 8:45am CDT

The authentics line gets very little attention and that's kind of the point. They are meant to simply be exist and be available at stores that don't often carry Transformers. Be it Dollar General in the US or Canadian Tire in Canada or a myriad of other shops in South America and Asia. They are just affordable Transformers toys of classic characters and now we have a first look at two more Wheeljack and Arcee. Wheeljack takes a major cue from his Earthrise toy while Arcee has a rather neat transformation giving it a lot more alt mode integration in robot mode the most we've ever seen for a toy basing itself on the G1 character model. These images are from ACD distribution . There will be no further reveal than this from Hasbro and you will find them this year in any store that stocked the previous releases. Arcee is 4.5 inches tall while Wheeljack is 7 inches tall. Posted by william-james88 on January 23rd 2022 @ 1:39pm CST

WOW a decent-to-good Arcee that's actually affordable and plentiful enough to show up at any store from the 5-Below in every other large stripmall to the last dollar store you stumble across in the middle of nowhere. The kind of thing so many of us have dreamed about since '86.



Now I can add her to my 3rd cousins' TF box in Illinois this summer instead of the rereleased Cyberverse Arcee (starting to think it's impolite to horde that toy since the new open-window packaging has cursed her with disappearing-head-syndrome; saw it first hand in a Target last week - tragic) Posted by Bumblevivisector on January 23rd 2022 @ 3:19pm CST

Yeah I wouldn't mind it at all if they took that Arcee design and made a mainstream release of it in Generations. Just have the back kibble raise up a bit and split (and paint the interior at least) lengthen those forearms and you have a really solid design that still looks like G1 Arcee.

I've got the Shockwave Ratchet and Barricade figures. Shockwave is pretty good; if the aesthetic wasn't so obviously Cyberverse-inspired he could fit in all sorts of collections. That Ratchet looks a tad better if you fiddle with the shoulders a little. Barricade is essentially perfect for the size and price.



I'm definitely looking for that Arcee and would certainly buy an upscaled version in a more mainstream line; perhaps the only improvement that would be needed would be fixing the forearm proportions.



And I'll probably buy that Wheeljack even though I don't really need a Voyager-sized 'Jack. What I need is a proper Cyberverse Deluxe Wheeljack.

I get this feeling like they designed Prime and Bumblebee first and then realized they could do a lot more at this price point articulation wise. If I'm not mistaken they're the only ones that don't have elbows which is odd considering their popularity.

Ratchet is a figure that would be incredible at a larger size with a few more moving parts but is still pretty neat for a $5 figure. His leg transformation is nothing short of genius for how effective it is and should really be replicated in a future figure. Basically the whole top of the rear van pops off and folds around and inside the bottom of the van hiding it completely and filling in all the lower leg gaps. He doesn't have knees or proper feet but that could easily be fit into a larger figure. Chuck did a review that shows them well. There is definitely a ""shell"" around the legs but again at a higher price point they'd be able to do more with them.







Likewise Barricade has basically the same leg transformation as Kingdom Tracks but it's much better done despite being simplified. That is a great figure right there all the art details are present and he's a fun figure to mess around with just needs a lot more paint to really do the mold justice (and fill in his windshield ""eyes"").

The transformation is satisfying for both. Optimus is surprisingly big and solid. The surprise is the same with Megs who become tiny and a bit flimsy.

Seriously I like that Megatron more than Core Megatron he borrows a lot from Legends class Megatron. It's nice to see a Megatron that knows how to integrate its treads and not have a ridiculously restrictive backpack. I wish his torso was a little bulkier but he makes for a nice futuristic tank.

Yeah I've been hearing quite a few say this actually works as a G1 arcee since the transformation style fits late G1. So in the end the simplicity and lack of articulation works to its merrit from that perspective.

chuckdawg1999 wrote: Authentics Arcee is a mixed bag. On the one hand it's a neat figure that transforms without being a shell former and it has some good articulation. On the other hand due to the nature of Authentics there are some tolerance issues with the legs and arms coming together while the articulation could be a bit more functional. In general the plastic doesn't feel as good as it could be. If you're looking for a simple Arcee then the Authentics version might be worth the look.

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

After over two years of sitting empty the building that once housed the Hogansville Piggly Wiggly and Family Dollar spaces will soon have a new occupant.

Georgia Wholesale located in Newnan is opening in the Highway 29 building in June and will hold its ribbon cutting ceremony on July 1 said Cindi Harris Taylor owner of Georgia Wholesale.

Georgia Wholesale sells a variety of items including clothes electrical appliances and furniture for a fraction of the cost of other stores Taylor said.

“We sell a little bit of everything” Taylor said. “It’s like all the stores mixed into one.”

The former Piggly Wiggly space not only accommodates the store’s needs but also allows the business to evolve in the area.

“We thought it was a good space to move into since Hogansville is growing and we will grow right along with it” Taylor said.

At roughly 23000 square feet Taylor estimates the space Georgia Wholesale will occupy is actually larger than the 16000 square foot one she currently occupies in Newnan she said which will allow her to add more products such as plants and food.

On occasion Taylor will get in unique or singular items. Recently she acquired a casket that she sold to a family for far below the retail price she said.

These standards cover a range of issues from emissions to corporate governance.

“We’re very aware of the environment and the concerns that everyone has about how we treat the environment” said President and CEO Mike John adding that it’s critical to the company and the dry natural gas industry to step up and be measured and accountable for what they produce and how they produce it. “We believe we’re part of the solution to cleaning up the air not part of the problem.”

Northeast is headquartered in Charleston with a Morgantown office. It has extensive operations in Monongalia County. Two of its Morgantown Industrial Park wells are Marcellus Shale Energy and Environmental Laboratory research projects conducted by the National Energy Technology Laboratory WVU and Ohio State University.

Responsible Energy Solutions will audit Northeast’s production pertaining to two separate certification standards.

NNE will use Baker Hughes LUMEN Terrain continuous emissions monitoring technology at one of its well pads to certify production under the MiQ methane standard. Northeast explains that the standard is independent third-party audited quantitative and graded across a sliding A-F scale based on three metrics: Methane intensity company practices and methane detection technology deployment.

Equitable Origin is a nonprofit that certifies energy production in accordance with its EO100 Standard for Responsible Energy Development. Equitable Origin-approved assessors will evaluate Northeast against the five principles: Corporate governance and ethics; social impacts human rights and community engagement; Indigenous Peoples’ rights; occupational health and safety and fair labor standards; and environmental impacts biodiversity and climate change.

Matt Sheppard owner of Sheppard Communication Strategies notified The Dominion Post of Northeast’s efforts and said Northeast will be the first natural gas exploration company in West Virginia and the first in the entire Marcellus region to have its entire operating field certified under the dual standards.

Northeast is a dry gas producer John said meaning just methane. “We’re excited about the concept of measurement of demonstrating to everyone ‘Let’s all be measured let’s all be transparent to what we do and how we do it.’ … We’re confident that we’re going to score very highly.”

Brett Loflin vice president of regulatory affairs said the EO100 will be an expensive process involving a self-assessment questionnaire. They also will send out an auditor interview employees look at the field operations and review documentation to substantiate the self-assessment.

The emissions portion is a pilot project and they may do some aerial surveys in the future he said. “That will obviously help us in the long run and we’ll know better how to improve and how to monitor our other pads.” He added that they have conducted leak detection and repair since they drilled their first well.

Northeast’s goal they said is to certify its entire field for ESG standards.

”This is an ongoing thing. This is not a one-time check a box” John said. “This is a commitment to ongoing evaluation and measurement of what we do to continue to refine our processes to continue to improve what we do.”

In the context of environmental responsibility The Dominion Post asked about a Department of Environmental Protection settlement of administrative consent order issued in June.

John said that the violations were tied to sediment in ephemeral streams associated with building a water line from the Monongahela River. A third-party consultant has been hired to inspect operations daily for erosion sediment control.

John said “We understand and accept that the environmental impact of what we do is going to continue to be the focus of most folks so we need to make sure it’s our focus.”

Northeast’s 2021 Sustainability Report notes that the company already has met its 2025 goal of reducing methane emissions to less than 1%. From 2017 to 2019 it has decreased emissions by 38% while increasing production 110%. All operations begin every shift with a pre-job safety meeting and each employee and contractor has stop-work authority.

The 50th specifically was delivered in Virginia (Loudon County Public Schools).

As part of phase one of Dominion Energy’s Electric School Bus Initiative Thomas Built Buses will deliver a total of 50 electric school buses in the state.

The company is delivering EVs also in other states and earlier this year received the nation’s largest electric school bus order in Maryland (326 units).

More about the projects:

""In 2018 TBB and Proterra unveiled the high-performance Jouley electric school bus. Now these 50 nationwide deployments represent the first Thomas Built Proterra Powered battery-electric school buses to hit the roads as cities towns and school districts transition to all-electric school bus fleets. • In Virginia TBB and Sonny Merryman Inc. were selected as the exclusive provider of 50 electric school buses to 15 public school districts for the first phase of Dominion Energy’s electric school bus program. The first of these buses which represent the first battery-electric buses in Virginia were delivered in November of 2020. • In Michigan Ann Arbor and Roseville Public Schools are operating six Jouleys in partnership with DTE Energy. DTE Energy will also initiate a Vehicle to Grid (V2G) study to obtain data regarding the energy efficiency and environmental benefits of electric vehicles and develop programs that benefit the schools based vehicle capabilities. • In Massachusetts the City of Beverly and Beverly Public Schools recently unveiled its first Jouley in partnership with Highland Electric Transportation a solutions provider for electric school buses based in Hamilton Mass. The bus will further participate in a V2G strategy deployed by Highland Electric Transportation and utility provider National Grid. • In Alaska Tok Transportation is operating the first battery-electric school bus in the state a Jouley in partnership with the Alaskan Energy Authority. • In Indiana Monroe County Community Schools and Delphi Community Schools both recently received their first Thomas Built electric school buses.""

The buses are powered by Proterra's EV tech including 226 kWh battery packs (top configuration) that allow driving for up to 135 miles (217 km).

The partnership with Proterra is not accidental as Thomas Built Buses is a subsidiary of Daimler Trucks North America and Daimler is a shareholder of Proterra since 2018.

What this all essentially means is that those who order pizza through the Domino’s app can now pay for it through Apple Pay on their iPhone or iPad.

This Apple Pay functionality has also been found on Domino’s website. The company’s stores accept Apple Pay in them as well.

Apple Card users will now be able to get 2% in Daily Cash on their orders that are made through the app when they tap on the “Check out with Apple Pay” button.” Previously customers were only getting 1% because they would have to manually type in the Apple Card info into their order.

Sleeping on the job is one thing but getting paid to do it?

That’s what eachnight a company focused on sleep health is offering: $1500 for taking a nap every day for 30 days.

Eachnight which offers mattress reviews and sleep guides and tips is hiring a team of “Nap Reviewers” to “test a few theories behind the pros and cons of napping” the company said.

“We know that in general different length naps have different benefits but we are keen to put this to the test and we need your help!” the company posted on its website.

The catch is that “Nap Reviewers” have to review their sleep time so even though applicants may live anywhere in the world they must have “strong English skills” for reviewing their naps and following instructions according to the post.

“Over the course of 30 days our dedicated nappers will be required to take part in a variety of experiments testing out theories such as the best nap duration for feeling refreshed the effects of napping on overall levels of fatigue and the effects of napping on memory motivation and productivity” eachnight wrote.

Applicants must also be at least 18 years old.

In recent weeks investors have received positive economic news that usually would push markets higher.

So why haven’t the large-cap indexes really gone anywhere?

That’s the gist of the question that our technical analysts John Jagerson and Wade Hansen tackled in their latest issue of Strategic Trader.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News Stock Advice & Trading Tips

In today’s Digest let’s find out their answer.

As importantly let’s discover how long these experts believe stocks will be stuck in neutral.

Let’s get right into it.

***If things are good why are we trading sideways?

For newer Digest readers John and Wade are the experts behind Strategic Trader. It’s an elite options service in which they combine insightful technical and fundamental analysis with market history to take advantage of all sorts of market conditions.

To identify profitable trade set-ups they analyze a variety of data points ratios and chart patterns. This information helps provide clues about where the market and specific stocks are likely headed.

In their update from Wednesday John and Wade turned their analysis to why markets haven’t risen much in recent weeks despite what appear to be supportive data.

Here they are beginning with the good news that would seem to support market gains:

According to Zacks Research of the 70% of the S&P 500 that have already reported earnings profits are up 49% and revenues have jumped 10.6%.

This shouldn’t be surprising when compared to market conditions in the first quarter of 2020. However even when compared to pre-pandemic trends growth is solid and is approaching records.

Factset also shows that average estimates for the second quarter are at their highest since the first quarter of 2018. These expectations are the second-highest since 2002.

In addition expectations are high because the tone of the outlook for earnings has been extremely positive this season.

With all that good news why haven’t the major large-cap indexes made any progress since mid-April?

To make sure we’re all on the same page let’s see exactly what John and Wade are referencing.

We’ll start with the Dow which has performed the best in recent weeks.

As you can see below since April 19th the Dow is up 1.5%. Notice that most of these gains have come in the last two days.

Moving on to the S&P it’s up just 1%.

The Nasdaq brings up the rear. It’s down 1.7%

So… if this earnings season has been so strong why aren’t stocks continuing their upward march?

Story continues

Taking the question one step further is this sideways action a precursor to a larger market correction? If not when will things kick back into gear?

Here’s John and Wade:

We feel that there is minimal risk that the market will drop significantly in the short term. However two significant factors could extend this “pause” for a few more weeks while traders wait for more data.

Let’s see what these significant factors are.

***Inflation fears have traders acting cautiously

From the Strategic Trader update:

We have addressed concerns about inflation in nearly every weekly update since stimulus checks first started going out last year. Yes the Fed is using unprecedented levels of quantitative easing and direct stimulus payments from the U.S. Treasury could be inflationary.

What appears to be making traders nervous is the future threat of inflation not something that is happening right now.

Investors tend to “overprice” the unknown which leads us to believe that market volatility related to this issue is itself inflated.

Now is there a way we can pinpoint volatility related to inflation concerns compared to broad market volatility? We need to ask this question since any number of issues could be leading to market jitters.

John and Wade suggest we look at “TIPS”:

The following chart below shows the yield on special bonds the Treasury issues that protect against inflation.

These Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) have a yield that will fall when inflation is expected.

(NOTE: remember the inverse relationship between yields and prices. A falling yield means prices are rising – in other words there’s demand for the asset which is pushing the price higher. In this case there’s demand for TIPS which are designed to protect against inflation.)

As you can see investors are pricing these as they did in 2013.

Two things to highlight about this chart beyond the levels that John and Wade just pointed out.

The first is how yields have been dropping since November 2019 – this is the broader trend.

Second notice how the recent upward reversal in trend has changed course. Since March 18th yields have resumed their broad trend downward trajectory.

You can see this easier in the chart below which zeroes in on 2021.

Back to John and Wade:

An appropriate question at this point is whether this pricing has been accurate in the past?

The short answer is mostly no.

Inflation excluding food and energy prices has remained trapped within a reasonably tight range around 2% for the last 20 years.

Because we believe inflation poses minimal short-term risks the market is likely to continue rising once these concerns die down a little.

However there are enough long-term warnings for potential inflation to keep our strategy flexible as more data is released.

So long-term John and Wade have their eye on inflation. But for now they believe this inflation-related sideways market action will be short-lived.

What about the second factor weighing on the major indexes?

***Profit-taking has been a headwind to additional market gains

Back to John and Wade:

A pattern that emerges in bull markets is for consolidations to occur once the market has rallied 161% of its prior drawdown. We attribute this cycle to normal profit-taking and rebalancing.

As you can see in the following chart below the market recently reached that technical level following the 2020 drawdown.

This level also lines up with a similar short-term analysis based on the March 2021 drawdown.

While it’s comforting to learn there’s a technical precedent for stocks taking a breather after such a long climb let’s turn to the logical question…

How much longer will it last?

From the Strategic Trader update:

Technical pauses like this are expected. Based on prior consolidations we should probably plan for this holding pattern to last for another 3-6 weeks.

While this doesn’t change our bullish outlook we can use the data to set timing expectations for the next breakout.

I’ll add that John’s and Wade’s options-selling service doesn’t need a bullish market environment to generate cash. This type of sideways market can be similarly profitable. If you’d like to learn more about how it works click here.

Wrapping up this stuck-in-neutral market isn’t fun to sit through but such consolidations are a normal part of investing. Fortunately if John and Wade are right the major indexes will be kicking back into gear soon enough.

We’ll continue to keep you updated here in the Digest.

Have a good evening

The 50th specifically was delivered in Virginia (Loudon County Public Schools).

As part of phase one of Dominion Energy’s Electric School Bus Initiative Thomas Built Buses will deliver a total of 50 electric school buses in the state.

The company is delivering EVs also in other states and earlier this year received the nation’s largest electric school bus order in Maryland (326 units).

More about the projects:

""In 2018 TBB and Proterra unveiled the high-performance Jouley electric school bus. Now these 50 nationwide deployments represent the first Thomas Built Proterra Powered battery-electric school buses to hit the roads as cities towns and school districts transition to all-electric school bus fleets. • In Virginia TBB and Sonny Merryman Inc. were selected as the exclusive provider of 50 electric school buses to 15 public school districts for the first phase of Dominion Energy’s electric school bus program. The first of these buses which represent the first battery-electric buses in Virginia were delivered in November of 2020. • In Michigan Ann Arbor and Roseville Public Schools are operating six Jouleys in partnership with DTE Energy. DTE Energy will also initiate a Vehicle to Grid (V2G) study to obtain data regarding the energy efficiency and environmental benefits of electric vehicles and develop programs that benefit the schools based vehicle capabilities. • In Massachusetts the City of Beverly and Beverly Public Schools recently unveiled its first Jouley in partnership with Highland Electric Transportation a solutions provider for electric school buses based in Hamilton Mass.

Police identified Tyrell Antar Cohen 25 after he was reported missing and later found dead at the Duke Energy substation.

Deputies with the Wake County Sheriff's Office responded to the Duke Energy substation around 9 a.m. after an employee found Cohen's body inside the perimeter.

Authorities believe Cohen died of electrocution while attempting to climb equipment while fleeing from law enforcement.

According to the Wake County Sheriff's Office Cohen was reported missing with the Raleigh Police Department on Saturday night after not returning home.

Wake County Sheriff Gerald Baker said North Carolina State Highway Patrol tried to initiate a traffic stop before Cohen went missing.

Cohen was reported missing on Saturday night after he didn't come home.

The 25-year-old is the brother of NFL running back and former NC A&T and Bunn High School star Tarik Cohen.

Tarik Cohen has talked about the search for his twin brother in recent social media posts.

Shortly after 9 a.m. Sunday Wake County Sheriff Gerald Baker stated that deputies responded to the Duke Power substation near Lead Mine and Six Forks roads after an employee discovered the body of a man inside the substation’s perimeter. It’s believed Cohen died of electrocution while attempting to climb some of the equipment.

Cohen's family and friends are having a hard time wrapping their heads around his death.

""All around he was truly a beautiful person"" a family friend told WRAL.

The family friend says this behavior isn’t like Tyrell.

""Don't try to color my boy bad because he's not here to defend himself"" the friend said.

A spokesperson with the Wake County Sheriff’s Office told WRAL Cohen was involved in a single-car crash near I-540 and Six Forks Road at 2 a.m. Saturday.

Officers with Raleigh Police Department say he ran from the scene and investigators could not find him.

They continued their search Sunday morning after family members filed a police report when Cohen didn’t return home.

The Chicago Bears issued a statement late Sunday night offering condolences to the Cohen family.

“We are heartbroken to learn of the death of Tarik Cohen’s twin brother Tyrell"" the statement said. ""Our immediate thoughts and prayers go out to Tarik his mother Tilwanda and the rest of their family and loved ones. On behalf of the entire Bears family we extend our most heartfelt sympathies to all who mourn his loss.”

Duke Energy spokesperson Jeff Brooks said Cohen's death was tragic and their agency is working with law enforcement to help their investigation.

""Substations contain high electric voltages and should only be accessed by highly trained personnel with authorized access"" Brooks said. ""Our stations are equipped with robust fencing safety signage and other measures to protect the public and to deter trespassing and access to equipment inside the substation.""

I hope I have lived up to both” du Pont said in announcing his longshot presidential bid in September 1986.

As a presidential candidate du Pont attracted attention for staking out controversial positions on what he hoped would reverberate with voters as “damn right” issues. They included random drug testing for high school students school vouchers replacing welfare with work ending farm subsidies and allowing workers to invest in individual retirement accounts as an alternative to Social Security.

Some of those ideas have since become more mainstream.

He won the endorsement of New Hampshire’s largest newspaper but failed to gain traction among voters. He ended his campaign after finishing next-to-last in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.

Afterward du Pont remained engaged in politics. He frequently wrote opinion pieces for publications such as the Wall Street Journal and co-founded the online public policy journal IntellectualCapital.com. He also served as chairman of Hudson Institute the National Review Institute and the National Center for Policy Analysis a nonpartisan public policy research organization.

Pierre du Pont IV was born Jan. 22 1935 in Delaware. After attending Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire he graduated from Princeton University in 1956 with an engineering degree. Following a four-year stint in the Navy he obtained a law degree from Harvard University in 1963.

He joined the Du Pont Company where he held several positions resigning as a quality control supervisor in 1968 to begin his political career.

After running unopposed for a state House seat in 1968 he immediately set his sights on Congress running as a fiscal conservative and winning the first of three terms in 1970.

Elected governor in 1976 du Pont fought successfully to restore financial integrity to a state he had declared “bankrupt” shortly after his inauguration. He presided over two income tax cuts; constitutional amendments restricting state spending and requiring three-fifths votes in the legislature to raise taxes; and establishment of an independent revenue forecasting panel.

After a rocky start with Democratic legislators including an embarrassing override of a 1977 budget veto du Pont forged successful relationships with lawmakers from both parties to tackle thorny issues including prison overcrowding and corruption and school desegregation. He was re-elected in a landslide in 1980 winning a record 71 percent of the vote and becoming the first two-term governor in Delaware in 20 years.

In his second term du Pont signed landmark legislation that loosened Delaware’s banking laws including removing the cap on interest rates that banks could charge customers. The Financial Center Development Act made Delaware a haven for some of the country’s largest credit card issuers.

Under du Pont’s leadership Delaware also established a nonprofit employment counseling and job placement program for Delaware high school seniors not bound for college. It served as the model for a national program adopted by several other states.

Prohibited by law from seeking a third term du Pont briefly withdrew to the private sector joining a Wilmington law firm in 1985. A year and a half later he announced his bid for the GOP presidential nomination becoming the first declared candidate in the 1988 campaign. George H.W. Bush won the GOP nomination that year and was subsequently elected president.

During an appearance at the Hotel du Pont in downtown Wilmington where du Pont announced he was abandoning his presidential campaign he praised an electoral process that gave a shot at the White House to a former small-state governor with unorthodox ideas.

“You’ve given me the opportunity of a lifetime. You listened you considered and you chose. I could not have asked for any more” du Pont said. “For in America we do not promise that everyone wins only that everyone gets a chance to try.”

Du Pont is survived by his wife of over 60 years the former Elise R. Wood; a daughter and three sons; and 10 grandchildren.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic a memorial service will be held at a later date Perkins said.

Pete du Pont dies at 86,"WILMINGTON – Former Gov. Pierre Samuel “Pete” du Pont IV who spearheaded Delaware’s landmark 1981 Financial Center Development Act that convinced many of the nation’s largest banks to move operations to the First State died Saturday at age 86 after a long illness his family announced.

A scion of the famed du Pont family the two-term governor was the son of Pierre S. du Pont III a DuPont company executive and the great nephew of Pierre S. du Pont who served as president of both DuPont and General Motors while also founding Longwood Gardens.

Like many in the family Pete worked for a time at DuPont before striking out in a career of public service. In 1968 he was elected to the state House of Representatives and two years later successfully won the race for Delaware’s lone congressional House seat as a Republican.

Du Pont would serve three terms in Congress before turning his sights back to his home state and running for governor in 1976 defeating Democratic incumbent Sherman Tribbitt. He would serve two terms as governor from 1977 to 1985 working with a Democratic-majority state legislature to pass two income tax cuts and measures to restrain state spending.

It was his push to cut back interest rate regulations to compete against a similar push by South Dakota in 1981 that would cement his legacy though. The Financial Center Development Act passed with bipartisan support aimed to help create at least 1000 new jobs in financial services in Delaware.

Over the succeeding decades it has been credited with creating tens of thousands of jobs spurring the growth of MBNA JPMorgan Chase Bank of America Discover Capital One Barclays and more largely in downtown Wilmington.

In many ways that job growth helped protect Delaware against the eventual decline of workforces tied to his family’s company DuPont which for generations had been the biggest economic driver in the state.

Du Pont made a failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1988 the same year that then-U.S. Sen. Joe Biden also failed to win the Democratic nomination.

Aside from politics du Pont was active in nonprofit and philanthropic work. In 1979 he founded Jobs for Delaware Graduates an employment counseling and job placement program for high school seniors not bound for college.

The Pete du Pont Freedom Foundation was also founded in 2003 in the former governor’s honor and supports innovation in public policy and economic development. Today it is chaired by his son Thère du Pont.

On Saturday evening the foundation released the following statement:

“While the news of Governor du Pont’s passing was not unexpected all those at the Pete du Pont Freedom Foundation are deeply saddened by this great loss. For a shining moment in Delaware’s history the State had a great leader and a steadfast friend. Pete du Pont possessed clear vision buoyant enthusiasm and a fascination for innovative approaches to old problems. When the du Pont Administration began rancor and confrontation were commonplace. Delaware faced enormous challenges including a financial structure that drove employers away at the very time that good jobs were critical to our future. State government spent more than it could afford; tax increases were the solution of choice for prior administrations; and no one had a plan to attract jobs and rebuild the economy. Pete changed all that by winning the confidence even affection of former political opponents. With that cultural change in Dover and with critical support from the loyal opposition he forged consensus about Constitutional financial reforms and tax reductions. More remarkable Governor du Pont spotted opportunity in the Nation’s hodge-podge of bank laws positioning Delaware as a center for the credit card industry. No single piece of legislation has had more immediate or significant impact on Delaware’s economy. Beyond these specific accomplishments Pete demonstrated that good will humor and a genuine sense of neighborliness coupled with clear vision can transform a State. Those values are in short supply these days making Pete du Pont’s passing yet more noteworthy. Delaware will miss its good friend Pete du Pont. The Pete du Pont Freedom Foundation exists to preserve that legacy by honoring the Governor’s accomplishments while creating enthusiasm for innovation that can nurture our future.

Du Pont is survived by his wife of over 60 years Elise and their four children Elise du Pont Zoller and her husband Preston; Pierre S. du Pont V and his wife Jenny; Benjamin Franklin du Pont and his wife Laura; Éleuthère I. du Pont (“Thère”) and his wife Darla; and 10 grandchildren. In addition du Pont is survived by his sister Michele Goss.

Due to the pandemic a memorial service will be held at a later date.

Pete du Pont the former Republican governor presidential candidate and DuPont heir whose sprawling influence transformed state government and helped bring the credit card industry to Delaware died Saturday. He was 86.

Du Pont died in his Wilmington home after battling a “long illness” said Bob Perkins former chief of staff. Because of the pandemic a memorial service will be held at a later date.

Born with Delaware’s most famous surname du Pont broke from the family business (and tradition) to become a politician. He entered office as governor when the state was in crisis. In eight years he led efforts to limit excess spending dramatically cut income taxes and created a slew of government agencies.

He also implemented school desegregation and his administration courted major banks to relocate to Delaware through tax cuts and deregulation ultimately remodeling the state’s image from anti-business to corporate tax haven.

Du Pont established himself as a moderate Republican as Delaware’s U.S. representative advocating for the environment and campaign spending reform. Post governorship which included a lackluster run for the presidency du Pont’s politics moved farther right once described as a mixture of Reagan conservatism and libertarianism.

During the rise of the tea party he spoke at rallies about fiscal conservatism. To many Delaware Republicans today’s GOP no longer reflects the party du Pont once led.

The self-effacing du Pont was known to have a quick wit and a good sense of humor.

His political hero was Winston Churchill.

“Government is not an end in itself; it is a means” du Pont said in his farewell address in 1985. “Restoring integrity to government restoring discipline to government and restraining government were part of a process of improving the means.”

Growing up du Pont

Pierre S. du Pont IV was born Jan. 22 1935 in Wilmington to parents Pierre S. du Pont III and Jane Holcomb du Pont. He is the descendent of E.I. du Pont de Nemours who founded the Du Pont Co.

Surrounded by immense wealth and privilege du Pont known as “Petey” described himself shy as a child. He was gifted with sports but not school. He earned lousy grades at Tower Hill and Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire. He often cajoled his sisters to play games which included human checkers on the marble checkered floor in the family’s home.

He later described his father as the tough parent who demanded excellence. It was his mother he went to for comfort.

A competitive sailor he competed in the America’s Cup trial races. He described feeling most comfortable when he went sailing.

Du Pont studied mechanical engineering at Princeton University then a college only for men because he figured it would be most helpful when he worked for the family business. He met his wife Elise Wood then a Bryn Mawr student on Princeton’s campus. (He did once go on a blind date with Jane Fonda.)

He and Elise met after a football game when du Pont and his buddies smoked cigars at the fraternity and debated religion. In an oral history with the Delaware Heritage Commission du Pont recalled hearing from the other side of the smoke-filled room: “That was a really dumb thing to say.”

It was Wood. The two married in 1957 and would have four children. Wood a descendent of Benjamin Franklin and heir to the Wawa fortune established a career in her own right. As her husband was based in the governor’s mansion she went to law school and later worked in the Reagan administration.

After graduation as the tension of the Cold War continued to build du Pont enlisted in the Navy. He was stationed in Newport Rhode Island and then Brunswick Naval Air Station in Maine. It was in Maine he first became interested in law.

Du Pont described his military service as “one of my life’s extraordinary experiences.”

“In the Navy you were with real people” he said in the oral history. “You had to manage their work understand their thinking and help them with their problems. … You learn about life in the Navy because you weren’t talking to the elite you were working with normal Americans.”

Du Pont excelled academically for the first time at Harvard Law. But after graduation he returned to Wilmington in 1963 to work at DuPont where his father was an executive. He was there for six years. He and his family lived in Rockland in an estate called “Patterns.”

“You begin to realize that in an enormous company — and I had lots of good opportunities there” he told the Washington Post in 1988 “but in an enormous company like that the chance of being in charge and leading really is 30 years away. That’s a long horizon.”

Entering politics meant breaking from family tradition and the expectations that had been set for him. Some in the family considered politics to be dirty business.

He started his political career in 1969 in the Delaware House of Representatives where he represented Brandywine Hundred. He ran unopposed.

Just the next year he ran to represent Delaware in the U.S. House of Representatives. His primary campaign slogan was: “Nominate a winner.”

Du Pont won the general election easily.

Transforming Delaware

When he arrived at the halls of Congress U.S. Rep. Pete du Pont quickly learned how much power he had — and didn’t have.

He was assigned to minor House committees at a time when Republicans weren’t in power. And being from a small state he didn't wield much influence. An aide once described him as bored during this era.

His most significant contribution during this time was co-authoring and sponsoring the War Powers Act of 1973 which limited the president’s war powers. During his second term in Congress President Richard Nixon faced impeachment.

Du Pont was one of the last congressional Republicans to abandon support for Nixon.

Tired of Washington du Pont sought the governorship in 1976. Delaware was a mess at the time: The state’s finances were in disarray unemployment towered at 9% debt was mounting and legal battles to desegregate schools continued.

Many Delawareans didn’t trust politicians at the time as this was post-Watergate. New Castle County Executive Melvin Slawik had just been removed from office after being convicted of perjury.

There had also been a rotating door of Delaware governors. By 1977 a governor had not served two consecutive terms in almost 20 years.

“The challenge then will be to recognize our limitations establish our priorities and live within our means” du Pont said in his inaugural address. “It will require personal discipline from each of us and political discipline from all of us.

“It will be painful” he said “but not fatal … .”

In the early days of the du Pont administration the governor passed executive orders on financial disclosures and judicial appointments. He also created the Delaware Economic and Financial Advisory Council an independent commission that would give the state an accurate prediction of how much money would be available in the fiscal year.

Yet du Pont would make a major political blunder early in his tenure leading to a News Journal headline of: ""A half-year of failure for du Pont.”

When the governor in March of 1977 addressed the General Assembly controlled by Democrats in both chambers he declared: “The state of Delaware is bankrupt.”

This statement shocked lawmakers and plummeted the state’s bond rating. The governor was forced to do damage control within the General Assembly and on Wall Street.

But the state’s finances were in fact in disarray. By summer 1977 the General Assembly was nearing the end of its session and no budget was in sight. Lawmakers drafted their own version which passed in both chambers.

Yet du Pont vetoed the budget during the July Fourth weekend. He wrote that what lawmakers wrote was “inaccurate unrealistic and detrimental to the future of Delaware."" But the General Assembly voted to overturn dealing a significant blow to du Pont.

It forced the governor to start building personal relationships with lawmakers. In the coming years the administration passed bipartisan legislation that created a spending limit of 98% of revenue for the fiscal year and subsequently saved the remaining money for the ""rainy day fund.”

Another key piece of legislation required a supermajority to increase taxes. Both these laws were enacted as constitutional amendments. By 1979 the state’s budget had a surplus of $20 million. Du Pont oversaw eight balanced budgets during his time as governor.

That same year he cut income taxes in half for the first time in state history.

Du Pont in his first term was tasked with implementing desegregation of public schools following a court order that culminated years of legal battles. This issue revolved around forced busing and there was a concern of unrest in New Castle County.

The Delaware General Assembly had failed to create any type of plan to integrate the schools resulting in du Pont calling lawmakers in for a special session in February 1978.

It was in the midst of a blizzard making the roads impossible to drive on. So du Pont sent a helicopter to pick up a lawmaker and bring him to Legislative Hall so he could pass the legislation — which the General Assembly eventually did.

Though the lawmaker wasn’t given a ride back.

Du Pont’s legacy as governor was likely crystalized with the passage of the 1981 Financial Center Development Act which led to the credit card and financial industry becoming a force in Delaware. The bipartisan legislation taxed bank profits at a lower rate than New York.

Passing this legislation was so important to du Pont that he ordered his lieutenant governor Mike Castle to stay in the Senate chamber in the event he would have to break a tie.

Castle remained in the Senate for nearly seven hours without taking any bathroom breaks according to the Delaware Heritage Commission’s oral history.

While the legislation created more than 40000 jobs it also created a new dependency on the financial services industry and corporate interest.

When du Pont left office in 1985 he was succeeded by his lieutenant governor Mike Castle. He described in 2004 to the commission how Delaware had an inferiority complex going into the du Pont administration — and ended this era with a superiority complex.

“I think to this day” Castle said “we maintained that outlook that as a small state we can be flexible we can get things done therefore we have advantages over other states which we really never thought before Pete du Pont.”

Life after governor

After leaving the governor’s mansion du Pont eyed the White House.

He became the first Delawarean in 62 years to seek the nation’s highest office. Du Pont launched his 1988 presidential campaign in 1986 way before other candidates including Joe Biden joined the race.

The late News Journal columnist Bill Frank wrote in 1986: “To be honest I must take the position that Pete du Pont has more background to guide him in the ways of a successful president than our other reported presidential hopeful U.S. Sen. Joe Biden Democrat.”

Du Pont ran on a controversial platform of policies called “Damn Right” which would have replaced Social Security with private savings accounts phased out farm subsidies and required welfare recipients to work.

The former governor was unable to gain any momentum and he dropped out after the New Hampshire primary. He would go on to create one of the first online political magazines in the mid-1990s and wrote a column for the Wall Street Journal from 2000 to 2014.

He founded the Pete du Pont Individual Freedom Award which honors a person who has helped create economic growth in the private sector. In recent years du Pont had mostly stayed out of the local limelight.

The Pete du Pont Freedom Foundation which oversees the award recently announced that for the first time this year a business will be presented with the honor: MBNA for being one of the first companies to move to Delaware following the passing of the Financial Center Development Act.

“Other than getting married and so forth” du Pont told a reporter in 1988 “being governor was the best life decision that I’ve ever made.”

In lieu of flowers the du Pont family asks donations be made to the Frontotemporal Disorders Unit at Mass General Hospital and the Pete du Pont Freedom Foundation.

WILMINGTON Del. (AP) — Among the moneyed du Ponts who preferred the privacy of their elegant homes and the offices and plants of the chemical company that bore their name Pierre S. “Pete” du Pont IV was a bit of a rebel.

Du Pont who died Saturday at age 86 after a long illness according to his former chief of staff broke with family tradition by leaving the family business for a career in law and politics.

That led du Pont to multiple elected offices and an unsuccessful bid in the 1987-88 Republican presidential primary race.

The du Ponts big-money establishment industrialists were among the nation’s wealthiest families. That wasn’t a problem for du Pont when he ran for statewide office in Delaware.

After one term in the Delaware state House and three terms in Congress du Pont was elected governor in 1976 and set about working to restore the state’s financial stability.

However his elite background turned out to be a problem for him in his race for national office.

“I was born with a well-known name and genuine opportunity. I hope I have lived up to both” du Pont said in announcing his longshot presidential bid in September 1986. As a little-known governor of a small state du Pont had to distinguish himself from the rest of the Republican field – including Vice President George Bush and Sen. Bob Dole.

He did that by questioning sacrosanct social programs that his better-known rivals feared to address such as doing away with farm subsidiaries.

Some of his positions were more conservative than those taken by then-President Ronald Reagan including mandatory drug testing of high school students.

Du Pont insisted his was a candidacy of ideas and he offered no apologies even after Bush dismissed as “nutty” du Pont’s idea to create another form of Social Security modeled on private IRA accounts. The idea later became a mainstream Republican proposal. So did another one school choice.

“Before you run for president you ought to decide why you want to be president and what you do if you get there” du Pont once said. “The only thing that would be worth being in that job is to try to change the things that need to be changed.”

But du Pont’s February 1988 withdrawal became inevitable after his poor showings in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.

During an appearance at the Hotel du Pont in downtown Wilmington where du Pont announced he was abandoning his campaign for president he praised an electoral process that gave a shot at the White House to a former small-state governor with unorthodox ideas.

“You’ve given me the opportunity of a lifetime. You listened you considered and you chose. I could not have asked for any more” du Pont said. “For in America we do not promise that everyone wins only that everyone gets a chance to try.”

Pierre du Pont IV was born Jan. 22 1935 in Delaware. After attending Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire he graduated from Princeton University in 1956 with an engineering degree. Following a four-year stint in the Navy he obtained a law degree from Harvard University in 1963.

He joined the Du Pont Company where he held several positions resigning as a quality control supervisor in 1968 to begin his political career.

He left a firm imprint on the government of his native state.

After running unopposed for a state House seat in 1968 du Pont immediately set his sights on Congress running as a fiscal conservative and winning the first of three terms in 1970.

As governor du Pont fought successfully to restore financial integrity to a state he had declared “bankrupt” shortly after his 1977 inauguration.

I JUST READ A BOOK that filled me with wonder and awe. Now would it startle you to hear that it was a book about wasps? Don’t cringe and turn away; listen as I talk to entomologist Eric Eaton author of the new book “Wasps: The Astonishing Diversity of a Misunderstood Insect.”

That the world would be a much worse place without wasps if it were a place at all is what I came away thinking about after reading Eric’s new book. Eric is previously lead author on the “Insects of North America” volume (affiliate link) in the popular “Kaufman Field Guide” series. We talked about fear of wasps yes but also about how much they contribute to the environment–in pest control pollination services and figs among other things (yes tiny wasps make figs happen).

all about wasps with eric eaton

Margaret Roach: Welcome to the program Eric or maybe I should say Bug Eric because I think that’s what your blog is called. How are you?

Eric Eaton: I’m good. Thank you for the invitation.

Margaret: Yes. It’s a wonderful book. It’s beautiful and incredibly interesting. I thought I’d be afraid. And speaking of that I learned a new word the word for the fear of wasps. Maybe you want to pronounce it for me [laughter].

Eric: Oh gosh it’s Latin I think it’s spheksophobia I believe or spheksophobia … depending on your preference.

Margaret: Yeah. A subcategory you say of entomophobia a fear of insects which I don’t understand but a lot of people have that.

Eric: Yeah I think we’re influenced by so many outside forces that it’s easy to become entomophobic even if you don’t start out that way.

Margaret: Yeah. So can we define what you as an entomologist think that a wasp is because I don’t think you just mean the guys in the paper nests on my back porch eaves or hanging in the crabapple branches in the backyard that I come upon and go oooh. I don’t think that’s all that a wasp is. So can you tell me your version of who’s a wasp what’s a wasp?

Eric: Right. Exactly. Our cultural definition of wasps is what you just shared which is the social wasps that we tend to associate with aggressiveness because they’re defending a nest full of their vulnerable siblings in an egg larva or pupal stage that can’t defend themselves. So their adult siblings do that for them.

But the scientific definition of wasps pretty much encompasses… It’s trending actually towards encompassing the entire order Hymenoptera which includes wasps bees and ants. And so all of those are traditionally known as social insects but the overwhelming majority of wasps and bees are solitary meaning that each individual female creates her own nest or in some cases there’s no nest involved at all. The wasp will simply lay an egg in a host and then go on to do that repeatedly. [Below a social tropical paper wasp nest in South Texas.]

Margaret: You said bees and wasps I don’t know if you said hornets or yellowjackets that’s another sort of word that we laypeople use. Sawflies even kind of look like wasps but are they wasps or what about the word hornet and yellowjacket and sawfly?

Eric: Yeah. You’re on point with all of those. All of those are considered wasps.

Margaret: To you as the expert [laughter].

Eric: Yeah. No to science and that’s an agreed-upon definition. They’re just simply subcategories of wasps. Sawflies do not sting. They’re considered the most ancient in the lineage of wasps and their larvae are actually very caterpillar-like in most cases and they’re feeding on foliage rather than on an insect host or a spider host or something like that that many of the wasps we think of do. So hornets and yellowjackets are both in the family Vespidae which includes those social species. And then it also includes solitary species known as pollen wasps mason wasps and potter wasps. [A mason wasp below.]

Margaret: Sawflies I think I read in the book go back the sort of the oldest of the ancestors 235 million years maybe or something. I mean their long history on the earth.

Eric: Well the evolution of wasps is still hotly debated. I mean especially when you get up to the point where they diverge into social insects. And so the way we arrive at our conclusions is based on ever-increasing technological tools and especially in the realm of molecular DNA analysis of existing wasps and seeing well O.K. what genes do they have in common with other extant wasps?

And the fossil record actually is doesn’t form somewhat but not probably as illuminating as you might expect. It’s more of tracing these ancestries back through analysis of living wasps.

Margaret: Right. So you say in the book—I love this—you say: “Periodic personal experiences with wasps may be painful but our civilization would not be advancing without these insects and natural ecosystems would collapse where it not for the diversity of wasps species we see today.”

So can you tell us briefly about sort of some of these waspy contributions that they make?

Eric: Yeah. Like bees and many other insects wasps can be pollinators. In the case of some flowers they’re the only pollinator and we call them oligolectic. That may be a word that’s already familiar to your listeners meaning that they’re obligatory pollinators of a very specific flower.

And there’s some wasps and flowers that have convergent evolution to the point where the flower actually mimics the female wasp. And so it’s the male wasp that is responsible for pollinating the flower. And this is true of several orchid species actually in Europe and in Australia in particular.

But if you like figs you can thank wasps for that [laughter]. They’re pollinated exclusively by extremely tiny wasps. That’s the other thing most people think of wasps as a pretty substantial insect but the overwhelming majority of wasps are under 5 millimeters in body length. And fig wasps are especially tiny. And so they enter the fig through a special opening and go inside and pollinate and carry out their entire life cycle in fact inside the fig.

So in that sense here we have an entire crop that owes its existence to and continued existence to having an evolutionary symbiosis with these little tiny wasps.

Pest control is the other big contribution that wasps make to us in terms of food production and protecting our gardens. They’re constantly hunting for other insects to use as hosts either where the host is or they will transport the host to a nest. So that’s a major contribution I would say probably the wasps make to humanity is keeping pests at tolerable levels.

Margaret: You say in the book that “there’s hardly any insect species in existence that doesn’t have at least one wasp enemy.” So that’s pretty amazing that they figure into so many other lives on the planet so to speak.

Eric: Definitely there’s a diagram I created for this book that shows how one generic moth species can host dozens of different kinds of wasps at each stage in the lifecycle from egg parasitoids wasps so tiny they develop entirely within the egg of a host. In some cases several wasps per one egg of the host. And other wasps will lay their egg in the egg but their larvae will develop inside the caterpillar. There’s other wasps that wait till the caterpillar is all grown up sting it and transport it to a nest.

And then in the case of yellowjackets or paper wasps they grab the caterpillar chew it up and take it back to the nest to feed their larvae. So there’s one host organism can have several different wasp parasitoids or predators acting on it.

Margaret: I love another phrase in the book. You say that “Wasps weaponized their egg-laying organisms” and that the sting—and you point out it’s not technically called a stinger as we lay people call it—but the sting is unquestionably the greatest evolutionary achievement of wasps. So tell us about that [laughter]?

Eric: Oh well I mean it initially probably advanced from the egg-laying organ which is called an ovipositor. And by the way you have probably seen fairly good-sized wasps trailing an appendage that looks like a giant spear or a whip or some other …

Margaret: Amazing. It’s amazing.

Eric: … really intimidating organ right. Well that’s not a sting that’s the ovipositor. And so if you see a wasp trailing an organ of that length it’s not something that’s going to sting you oddly enough. It’s when they don’t have something obvious on the rear of their abdomen [laughter] that you should probably take heed of because the sting is a retractable organ that’s by the time it’s deployed you’re feeling the pain basically.

But initially in the parasitoid wasps—and by the way a parasitoid is defined as a parasite that inevitably kills the host at some point—so the parasitoid wasp probably at some point said: “O.K. look trying to lay an egg on a thrashing caterpillar is just not going to work. So let me paralyze it temporarily so I could do my business of laying an egg.” And so that’s probably how the sting came to be.

Margaret: I see.

Eric: And then it had an associated venom gland with it. And then as wasps continued their evolution it evolved for social species into a defensive weapon. Some wasps by the way can even spray their venom out of their sting.

Margaret: Wow.

Eric: So yeah. That’s probably how it happened.

Margaret: Cool yeah.

Eric: But again when it comes to the evolution of wasps there’s a lot of gaps still to be filled in.

Margaret: Yeah. Do only females sting?

Eric: That’s correct.

Margaret: O.K. And all wasp species are capable of stinging or some don’t?

Eric: That’s a very good question. Our definition of venom itself is changing.

Margaret: Ah!

Eric: I mean when I was growing up things that were venomous were snakes spiders wasps bees. But now we’re learning that venom is pretty much any kind of substance that is introduced to a host and affects the host in some fashion. And so now when you look at the relatives of sawflies there are these insets called horntail wood wasps. And we have known for some time that they introduce… The female when she lays her eggs introduces a fungus that helps predigest cellulose in the wood so that her larva can feed more easily and gain nutrition from what they’re eating.

Now it turns out that at least a few species also introduce a type of substance that weakens the tree and allows the fungus itself to get a greater purchase on the host [laughter]. So we’re learning all these nuances all the time.

And so I’m not even sure quite how to answer that. Obviously sawflies do not sting. We know that for sure but some of the things that we have traditionally thought of as non-stinging parasitoids like ichneumon wasps and braconids and even some of the super-tiny micro hymenopterans maybe they sting after all but they’re so tiny that they wouldn’t even be able to penetrate your skin. So if you’re talking purely in does it sting me? No not at all wasps do.

Margaret: Right. You said ichneumon wasps and the first time I ever learned about ovipositors those crazy appendages those thread-like things out the back end of a wasp was from well I put two and two together. I had seen it outside in the garden and then I read a book I think by Bernd Heinrich former University of Vermont professor and so forth. And his father had studied those in particular. And so I was like “Oh that’s what I saw.” You know what I mean? Because this was many years ago I didn’t know.

You also mentioned what we would call the wasp waist the sort of body structure is part of the secret of the effectiveness of the sting yes? The way the body is structured helps that sting operate doesn’t it? [Above a giant ichneumon wasp.]

Eric: Yeah. The abdomen articulates a little bit differently than in other insects. And so you’ve got for example a mud dauber [below] that’s got this long stalk between the perceived thorax the middle body part where the legs and wings are attached. And then there’s this long stalk and then the perceived abdomen on the other end of it. And it can whip that in several directions to either defend itself or usually it’s used primarily to paralyze a spider a victim to take back to the nest. But the interesting thing is that stalk itself is part of the abdomen and it’s attached to the rear of the thorax but the part it’s attached to back there is also the first segment of the abdomen.

And so because of this strange anatomy scientists entomologists have developed different terms for it that don’t apply to other insects. And so you’ve got these body parts on wasps that other insects don’t have and you have different names for the abdomen itself versus what looks like the abdomen.

And it can be very confusing even for scientists if they don’t agree ahead of time [laughter] on what they’re pointing at so yeah. But yes certainly the articulation of the abdomen allows the sting to operating in several different directions.

Margaret: Yeah. So you mentioned wasps for instance maybe paralyzing or subduing and eating a caterpillar taking a caterpillar to use as food or what else do wasps eat. And maybe even more important does anybody eat wasps—like who’s their predator?

Eric: Oh wow. Other wasps actually are among their chief enemies. There are some that attack adult wasps. There are parasitoids that attack other wasps inside their nest.

There are flies called robber flies that hunt wasps. There are satellite flies as they’re known that are very small flies that infiltrate the nest of solitary wasps and lay their… they actually deposit larvae rather than eggs into the nest. And so the fly larvae crawl into the nest and feed on the provisions that were intended for their host.

And there’s velvet ants which are actually wingless wasps that do the same thing. They infiltrate the nest of another solitary wasp.

So there’s vertebrates birds that certainly prey out of wasps. And because they have that sharp horny bill they’re pretty impervious to stings but even so some of them like tanagers will rip out the sting before they eat the insect.

Margaret: Oh!

Eric: There’s a picture …

Margaret: Never seen that going on here.

Eric: … in the book of a red-bloated caracara which is a tropical raptor that just lands on a nest of social wasps and tears into it and starts plucking out the larvae inside the nest. There’s something called a honey buzzard that’s also a raptor that does the same thing. It actually digs up a subterranean nest of yellowjackets and feeds on the larvae.

So there’s bears and skunks love to tear into wasp nests to get to those juicy grubs.

Margaret: I’m always fascinated by insects that look like other insects. And if I were going to anthropomorphize and lay that on them I’d say they’re very smart—the ones that decided to look like wasps. And of course they didn’t decide and it’s not necessarily about smart in the way that we think about smart but the evolution of some other insects to have mimicked the appearance of a wasp to protect themselves.

Maybe we should talk about a few of those because boy there’s a lot of them out there when one is trying to figure out who’s a bee who’s a wasp who’s this who’s that? There’s also these mimics yes these lookalikes? [Above a wasp lookalike a thick-headed fly.]

Eric: Oh yeah. Yeah. Everything from beetles to moths to flies true bugs and katydids in the tropics that are… And they’re not even convincing just in appearance but it’s behavior that they do that reinforces that. And I mean there’s katydids in the tropics that looked like these giant tarantula hawk wasps and apparently they move in such a fashion that even seasoned entomologists are going “O.K. I think that really is a wasp.”

Margaret: [Laughter.]

Eric: And there’s flies here in North America that they don’t have the same anatomy quite right as a wasp and so they compensate for it. For example they have very short antennae and so they’ll compensate for that by waving their front legs to imitate the longer antennae of wasps. They’ll fly in a manner that’s very similar to a yellowjacket for example.

Generally if you see something hovering it is not going to be a wasp. Flies are much better at hovering than wasps and in fact even most bees. So that’s one thing you can watch for but probably I’m going to just say probably half of the insects that the average person assumes are wasps are not. The flies are often the flower flies in particular are often more abundant than wasps.

Margaret: Yeah. I want to just say sort of as gardeners how should we embrace wasps so to speak and make them welcome. And I mean the ones on the other extreme that aren’t good roommates or wouldn’t be good roommates I don’t know I’m always inclined to dispatch a nest I see being built right by the porch or something. But in the outer reaches it’s like that’s their world and they’re welcome to it.

But is there anything I mean is it just a diversity of plants to take resources from that we should be planting or is there anything that makes a wasp especially happy? I don’t even know if they use water in the same use large resources of water or they just take that from plants or what? [Above a Northern paper wasp nest.]

Eric: They certainly drink especially the ones that make paper nests or mud nests—they are often termed water carriers. And so they take water to a source of soil or of wood fibers and then turn them into nesting material.

My overriding philosophy is that: Don’t play favorites. The goal of your garden should be biodiversity in general.

Margaret: Yes.

Eric: If you’ve got all the players things are going to take care of themselves. And so people for example who grow milkweed specifically for monarchs and then can’t tolerate any other insect on the milkweeds [laughter] really peeve me because…

Margaret: No I think you’re right. Yeah.

Eric: So yeah and be weed-tolerant unless it’s a noxious weed that is listed for your state maybe let it go and see if it doesn’t draw some pollinators. It could be a native wildflower. Product is really rarely something that is going to solve a problem. The major problems in our society at large and in gardens to are your mindset your attitude so that’s really kind of the crux of it.

And remember that we manufacture more pests than exist in nature. A yellowjacket can’t tell the difference between your barbecue and the leftovers of a coyote kill for example. It’s the same thing to them [laughter].

Margaret: Very well… that is a very good point yes.

Eric: Yeah. And our architecture for crying out loud. Our houses have overhangs which mimic cliff faces and rock ledges that paper wasps and mud daubers and things naturally nest under. So of course they’re going to look at our house as another cliff face and behave accordingly.

Margaret: Exactly [laughter].

Eric: If you notice a nest and it’s already got several wasps on it it’s probably not going to be a problem. If it took you this long to notice it the wasps clearly… You and the wasp are not noticing each other or bothered by each other. So we had a bush in our yard once that had a hornet nest but we didn’t know it until all the leaves fell off [laughter].

Margaret: Exactly. Surprise.

Eric: Yeah.

Margaret: Yeah. Well as I said at the beginning I was at first a little cringing and then I opened the book up and I started to read and I started to learn. And it’s great “Wasps: The Astonishing Diversity of a Misunderstood Insect.” Eric Eaton thank you so much for making time today.

Pricing and availability are subject to change.

The fortunes of Chrysler Corporation have been on a roller coaster going back decades. If we look to the recent past one particularly dramatic renaissance occurred in the early-to-mid 1990s. That's when Chrysler emerged from more than a decade of peddling K-car-based products to field a dramatically styled modern new lineup. The headline vehicle for that turnaround was the company's trio of LH-platform cars among them the Chrysler Concorde. To get a sense of exactly what that car was like we can't imagine there's a better example than this 1994 Chrysler Concorde for sale right now on eBay Motors.

The Concorde was introduced for 1993 alongside the Dodge Intrepid and the Eagle Vision (remember Eagle division?). The cars introduced a new ""cab-forward"" architecture that instantly made the big sedans' competitors look old. Impressed by the LH sedans' spacious interiors and competent handling and enthralled with brash-talking cigar-chomping Chrysler executive Bob Lutz the automotive media heaped praise on the trio. The LH cars were Automobile Magazine's Automobile of the Year for 1993 and the Concorde ended up on Car and Driver's 10 Best lists in '93 and '94.

This second-year Concorde finished in period-appropriate two-tone exterior with contrasting-color lower cladding is a time warp. Check out the blue cloth interior the mesh alloy wheels and the Infinity cassette stereo. Incredibly this show car shows just 987 miles on the clock and the condition certainly seems to support that odo reading.

At this writing the car is at $7600 after just two bids. The reserve however has not been met. There are still a few more days to go in the auction so it remains to be seen how the market values a top-flight Concorde. Will these Lutz-era Chryslers someday get their due? If so the time to buy might be now.

CHANGE CHECKER Rare Olympic swimming 50p coin sells for £1000 on eBay – how to spot if you have one

A RARE Olympic swimming 50p coin has sold on eBay for almost £1000 - and you could have one in your change at home too.

The coin is one from the London 2012 Olympic Games series and it depicts the image of a swimmer.

2 The error coin features many lines across the swimmers face by mistake Credit: eBay

In total there were 29 different designs issued in 2011 to mark each of the events at the Games that were held a year later.

But the reason this particular coin is so valuable is that it is actually an error coin.

Ahead of the coin's release in 2011 the Royal Mint redesigned the aquatics 50p with fewer water lines crossing the swimmer's face making them more visible.

But a small number of coins were accidentally struck with the original design and entered into circulation.

2 The rare coin ended up selling for almost £1000 Credit: eBay

Nobody knows exactly how many of the error coins were mistakenly made although it's thought to be around 600 making them even more valuable to a collector.

This particular circulated coin ended up selling for £955 10 days after it was listed for just 1p.

The price was pushed up after receiving 65 bids from 15 different buyers who were attempting to get their hands on the coin.

It's not the most we've ever seen this coin sold for - in June one sold for a whopping £10100 - but is it the second highest.

Experts at ChangeChecker predict the error coins could be worth between £1000 and £1500 but in 2018 one fetched £600 on the auction site.

The best way to find out if your error coin is genuine RARE and valuable coins can go for a hefty sum - but how do you know if your coin is the result of a genuine minting error? The best way to find out if you have an error coin is to send it to the Royal Mint museum which will analyse it and see if it is a result of a genuine minting error or not. It'll normally take a couple of weeks to get the results back to you. But remember there's a difference between a genuine error coin and one that is just imperfect for example with a design that is not as clear as you'd expect. And whatever you do don't be tempted to splash your cash without evidence from the Mint confirming that it's a genuine error.

If you've got one at home check to see if the water lines cross over the swimmer's face - if they do then you could be on to a winner.

Of course a coin is only worth what someone will pay for it so there's no guarantee that yours will sell for as much.

Coin expert Colin Bellamy who runs Coin Hunter previously warned Sun readers to be cautious before bidding on the aquatics error coins listed on eBay because there are a number of fakes on the market.

He said: ""There are large numbers of copies of this coin some sellers list items to deceive people into thinking they are buying a real Royal Mint produced coin.

""Stay away from eBay listings. Your best bet may be a car boot sale.""

Coin Hunter has a tool that reveals how much your rare 50p coin is really worth on eBay.

It's not the only coin tracker available - ChangeChecker.org launched own eBay league table this time last year.

But now the cleaning sensation real name Sophie Hinchcliffe has shared a bargain beauty eyebrow hack that could change the game forever.

If you're tired of spending time perfecting your eyebrows in the morning these £6 temporary eyebrow tattoos could be the perfect answer.

The star - who is expecting her second child - revealed she'd picked them up on eBay after being inspired by beauty blogger @danigmakeup.

In a bid to take her followers through the application process Mrs Hinch put one of the temporary tattoos on her arms.

As with a regular temporary tattoo you simply need to wet the application paper with a cloth and then remove the transfer paper.

She said “I thought I would pop a pair on my arm now and just show you how they work

“My brows are microbladed but I can’t get them done at the moment so I wanted to try these to give me extra brow strokes.""

And Mrs Hinch couldn't believe the results of her bargain beauty buy.

""I’m sorry but how amazing are these guys?” she gushed. “I can’t get over how real these look! I’m so impressed!!! EBAY EYEBROWS ARE THE ONE!!! I love eBay even more now!!!”

But one thing worth mentioning is the temporary tattoo brows don't budge easily - and sellotape must be used to remove them.

She joked “Do they wipe off easily? Nope! If I went into labour now I think that the midwives would be a little confused.

“I think you just use sellotape to get them off guys!”

Since becoming famous Mrs Hinch has become firm friends with Stacey Solomon - and the pair were finally reunited last week after months apart.

Mrs Hinch visited Stacey at her new home Pickle Cottage and paid tribute to their true friendship.

A rare 50p ""error coin"" marking the London 2012 Olympic Games has sold on eBay for a whopping £1000.

And you could have one at home after around 600 of the swimming coins were accidentally released to the public.

A total of 29 different 50p designs were created to commemorate the games each featuring a different sport the Mirror reports.

But the recently-sold coin is worth a lot more as it was redesigned to remove water lines across the swimmer's face shortly after being released in 2011.

Only a few of the original ones accidentally made it into circulation - thought to be around 600.

The 50p coin making news now was originally listed for 1p on eBay but after receiving 65 bids 15 buyers had soon pushed it up to £955.

Another coin with the same error was sold in June 2020 for £10100.

So if you're checking a stash of 50ps in your home look out for the Olympic swimmer coin with too many lines on the face as you could be set to make a pretty penny.

Experts believe the error coins could be worth between £1000 and £1500 but warn there are many fake copies of this coin on the market.

It comes after a string of unlikely eBay deals reported by the Daily Star.

(Image: Ebay)

A ""hopeful"" eBay seller was caught flogging London Olympics trainers for £1249000.

User hazza3000's brand-new special edition Adidas kickers costed more than a special-edition Aston Martin Valhalla (£930000).

They appeared to be the only brand-new Games Maker pair selling on the site with used ones going for £17.99.

He did not respond to requests for comment by the Daily Star and the shoes which were used by volunteers for the games remain for sale with £7.99 extra for postage.

Yet it appears other eBay users could still have given him a run for his money.

Ruth Eidsforth who runs Discount Sports Skipton with her husband Tony admitted her shop accidentally put up a pair of Adidas Womens trainers for £504000 on eBay.

After we alerted her to the listing last month she said: ""Must have been an error! I'm going to blame my husband for that one.

""If we sell them for that we would not need to open shop in April. That would be awesome.""

Asked about Hazza's offer she added: ""Bloody hell. I'm not sure who's paying that for them. That's a bit unrealistic.

""That's either an error or that's very hopeful."""

The piece will be available as a non-fungible token (NFT) on May 5. Garcia’s “Gift” will be an authentic one-of-a-kind piece.

The environmental element of the art release will use the carbon offset tools made available by Aerial an ecologically driven platform focused on alleviating humanity’s carbon footprint. This particular release will support Aerial’s forest conservation work verified by the American Carbon Registry and Climate Action Reserve.

“We’re excited to help creators including Jerry Garcia Music Arts understand and mitigate the carbon footprint by supporting meaningful projects” said Aerial cofounder and entrepreneur Andreas Homer.

Jerry Garcia best known as the lead guitarist and vocalist of the Grateful Dead considered himself “an artist who played music.” The visionary Garcia began creating art as a young child and later studied formally at the San Francisco Art Institute. The many mediums Garcia chose to create with — oils watercolor ink and digital — were as versatile as his talents. Garcia’s fine art has traveled throughout the United States and the world in multiple exhibitions. In 2014 several of the virtuoso’s fine art pieces were displayed and eventually donated to the “Art in Pop” museum exhibition at the Centre National d’Art Contemporain Le Magasin in Grenoble France. In January 2015 the Jerry Garcia Foundation launched an ongoing charity arts program to support environmental artistic and humanitarian causes.

“I think my father would have loved the concept of NFTs especially with the carbon offset component. After seeing how this new space is empowering artists and creators around the world to make a living doing what they love I’m excited and honored to help bring his original art into this new era of art history and share it with a new generation of creatives. My father was a pioneer in so many ways and likely one of the first musicians creating digital art in the late eighties to early nineties” said Keelin Garcia Jerry’s youngest daughter.

A charitable component of the project will support the preservation of the planet’s coral reefs a cause Garcia championed in his lifetime. Garcia frequently traveled with his family to the Hawaiian Islands where he developed a love for scuba diving among the coral reefs often referred to as the “rainforests of the sea.”

Collections of Garcia’s visual art can be viewed online at Rolling Stone and the Garcia Weir Gallery.

Martell raised $2 million from angel investors in a recent Series A round Edwards said. The company aims to raise $10 million this year in a Series B round that Edwards hopes will attract institutional investors as well as diagnostics and pharmaceutical companies that invest in venture-backed companies.

The company which is collaborating with the University of Minnesota and the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida soon expects to publish clinical studies that will validate its tests and show doctors what they do and how to use them Edwards said.

Martell also is reaching out to patient groups to make them aware of the test. The company which has five employees expects to double in size by year end including hiring a small sales staff.

Martell tests patient samples at its certified national research laboratory in Roseville. Its breast cancer blood test measures a biomarker that increases when a tumor is growing and decreases when treatment is effective Edwards said. A separate test measures a biomarker that is elevated in some lung cancers.

Edwards who has more than 20 years of experience in life sciences joined Martell in March 2020 as pandemic-related shutdowns took effect.

Edwards previously was a director at Navigant Consulting. She also has worked at Eli Lilly and Co. a Bay Area biotech startup developing a cancer therapy and the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Edwards a former U.S. Army officer has a political science degree from Johns Hopkins University and an MBA from Duke University.

Q: Is this a new approach to breast cancer management?

A: In terms of monitoring patients the best analog today is the PSA test for men with prostate cancer. A lot of men are monitored to make sure their PSA levels don't start rising. It isn't currently done for breast cancer but we believe it should be because this biomarker has been shown to increase when cancer is growing so we think women should be monitored for that as well.

Q: What are your immediate priorities?

A: Fundraising is absolutely at the top of the list so we can start scaling up our team. We've got to look for a chief medical officer and a chief commercial officer to help round out our executive team and build the infrastructure to help get this commercialized. And then frankly every opportunity to introduce Martell to potential partners and customers that's an ongoing effort as well.

Q: What is Martell's growth potential?

A: With breast cancer [there are] about 300000 newly diagnosed cases every year in the U.S. and about 3 million women and growing that have successfully completed treatment or are living with breast cancer. When you think about monitoring the new diagnoses through their treatment and then monitor women who are recovered and living their lives and hoping to make sure that the cancer doesn't come back that's a big opportunity.

Q: How did joining Martell during pandemic affect your work?

A: We're a startup so resources are precious. One thing I would have done in normal times was traveling to meet investors and stakeholders in person. And that's expensive. The silver lining was everybody was home everybody was willing to take a meeting and we were able to accomplish that virtually which was a lot easier time-wise but also a lot easier on our resources.

Very few photographers get to live the dream that Aaron Rose talked about and in fact achieved. Far more famous photographers Ansel Adams for one have done commercial work to fund their artistic passions.

Apprenticeship

Aaron Rosenweig was an orphan who grew up in foster homes because his father refused to claim him and his mother Rose was institutionalized when he was born. Aaron changed is last name to Rose to honor his mother.

At one of his many foster homes he met a photographer who gave him work as his assistant holding lights and reflectors.

Rose told Bloomberg in a 2014 interview that being an assistant gave him something to do. “But more than that when we got back and I saw the pictures being made in the darkroom all the people he was shooting always came out so beautiful. It fascinated me.”

After graduating from the High School of Performing Arts he did commercial photography but really shot for his own enjoyment.

Collecting antique tools was a side hustle for Aaron Rose. Over the years he had gathered a fairly large collection from his travels into the American countryside and into Europe to obtain rarer hard-to-find items.

They became the foundation he used to build his income as a small-time landlord in SoHo. Rose sold his collection of antique tools to the Eli Lilly Company for a quarter of a million dollars and used $156000 of it to buy a multistory building.

Refuge in SoHo

He moved into the building in 1969 renting the street level as retail space and the upper floors. For years the retail tenant was the Holly Solomon Gallery. Today the space houses Smith & Hawken.

”I only knew that I had found a huge place with beautiful light and it was cheap enough to let me do what I cared about “Rose recalls the time saying “The neighborhood had only a few artists back then. I had a printing plant on the floor below me and a factory above me and every morning the machines would start to go and I never needed an alarm clock.”

The income from his tenants freed Rose from having to pursue commercial photographic work. It allowed him to explore photography and avoid having to sell his work at galleries or for that matter to show it which happened rarely.

Alchemist

Aaron Rose

Rose would be considered today as a control freak. He wanted to control the way his photographs are made to the point of mixing his own chemicals for the darkroom. He printed his photographs in a darkroom he built which some regarded as an alchemist’s laboratory. He shunned premade developers from suppliers like Kodak Edwal Ilford and others. He mixed his own formulas and regularly made only one print of each photographic negative.

Paul Goldberger writing for The New York Times in March of 1997 quoted Rose ”The process is quite phenomenal if you just allow it to go I get excited by the way the light strikes the silver or the gold. I think of myself as partly an alchemist.”

Aaron Rose dedicated himself to the creation of a body of work that is similar in scope and size to the most prominent of photographers today. The difference is that he has done it quietly without publicity and with scant gallery showings. He has sold a few photographs to collectors and friends and has regretted it each time. Since he prints each photograph only once selling a print was letting go of part of his creativity.

Rarely seen photos

Rose photographed rooftop views of New York and underbrush (opening photo top row first & second images) the destruction by the march of progress of Manhattan’s original Penn Station from 1964-65 (opening photo top row group of five images) and Coney Island (opening photo bottom row.)

He was persuaded to show some photographs in the Whitney Biennial in 1997. The world got a glimpse of the one-of-a-kind images he created. His Coney Island work wasn’t shown until 2014. The City Museum of New York held a 70 photograph exhibition “In A World of Their Own: Coney Island Photographs 1961-1963.”

Rose made these images with a Leica 35mm camera using early color print film. He said “In order for me to get the pictures that I wanted I needed to catch people totally spontaneous without any kind of idea that a picture was even taken. So I ended up looking spotting things rehearsing how I was going to walk past that and made my transitions very fast very smooth. In order to do that you need very high-speed color film.”

Pushing the film

Rose solved his need to shoot at 1/1000 of a second to get look he wanted by increasing the ISO of the film as far as it could be pushed in processing. The result he achieved were images that had a grainy texture and muted colors. The prints look almost like pointillism.

The first image in the exhibition was of a crowded beach scene that was blown up to cover an entire wall in the museum. A longer look reveals that everyone is looking at a young man in full drag including rouge on his prominent cheekbones and his upswept hair (opening photo bottom row first image.)

Sean Corcoran City Museum of New York’s curator of photographs and prints said of Rose “He was trying to get to the core of who people were on the beach.”

Here are three companies that offer formidable challenges.

Tesla (TSLA -1.74%) is the undisputed leader of the electric vehicle revolution with a stock that is up more than 1300% over the past five years. The company has four vehicle models on the road is building new factories around the globe and continues to develop complementary products including its solar energy system cutting-edge battery technology and autonomous driving system.

The company and the stock has come a long way but there are still challenges up ahead and companies with the potential to knock Tesla back a bit.

Here's why three Fools believe Alphabet (GOOG -1.05%) (GOOGL -1.09%) Ferrari (RACE 1.30%) and Enphase Energy (ENPH -2.23%) are set up well to mount challenges to key parts of Tesla's business in coming years.

The Google car could win the autonomous race

Lou Whiteman (Alphabet): A substantial part of the bull case for Tesla is built around its autonomous tech. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest -- in setting its ambitious $3000 per-share price target on Tesla back in March -- built its argument in part based on its expectations that Tesla in the years to come will be able to launch an autonomous robotaxi service.

Tesla may well get there but there are a lot of other companies exploring autonomous driving that could get there first. Although Alphabet is more known for its Google search engine and YouTube streaming service its Waymo self-driving subsidiary looks like a serious contender for the autonomous crown.

Waymo has taken a slow and steady approach over the years. But the company's tech has progressed far enough that last year it signed a deal with what is now Stellantis (STLA -1.56%) to develop ""Level 4"" autonomous-driving commercial delivery vans.

Level 4 is not fully automated but it is more advanced than the Autopilot Tesla currently has on the roads. And Waymo believes its system (which unlike Tesla deploys laser-based tracking known as lidar in addition to cameras for navigation) is safer than its rival's tech.

I'm not an engineer and won't claim to know for sure which company and technology will win out in the end. But Waymo has a lethal combination of a deep-pocketed backer in Alphabet impressive auto-industry partners like Stellantis and years of development experience to help make its vision of an autonomous future a reality.

If nothing else Waymo is well positioned to provide Tesla with a serious challenge as the tech continues to develop.

The most profitable automaker in the world is (sort of) on sale

John Rosevear (Ferrari): If you think Tesla is too much -- too hyped too expensive too overblown -- then how about the anti-Tesla?

Ferrari isn't exactly an anti-Tesla of course. While its stock-in-trade is its jewel-like high-powered (and thirsty) V-8 and V-12 internal combustion engines the company is in touch with the reality of where the world is going. Ferrari already offers one hybrid model the SF90 Stradale sports car and it's planning to launch a fully electric sports car in 2025.

But Ferrari is unlike Tesla in some important ways. First it's massively profitable with the best operating margins in the auto business (and zero tax-credit sales). Second its sales volumes are tiny and likely to stay that way: While Tesla is hoping to sell a million vehicles a year before long Ferrari is quite content to be selling 10000 or thereabouts.

But auto investors should take note: While Ferrari deliberately limits its annual production to preserve its exclusivity and pricing power it does have a plan to boost its profits and margins. That plan is centered on a series of new models some of which will enter new territory for the brand (there's an SUV-like Ferrari in the works) and some of which will be high-priced limited-production models for Ferrari's most loyal and deep-pocketed fans.

Ferrari announced the plan back in 2018. At the time it said it expected its profits to roughly double by 2022. The company said this past week that COVID-19-related delays have slowed its product-development efforts and it's now pushing that deadline out a year to 2023.

News of the delay hurt the stock but that in turn might create a buying opportunity. Ferrari is still on track to hit its ambitious profit goals -- something that I think some auto investors missed; it's just that the train is going to arrive a bit later than expected.

Of course despite the sell-off Ferrari's stock still doesn't seem cheap at almost 43 times expected 2021 earnings. But if you think of Ferrari as an elite luxury brand (which it arguably is with operating margins around 25%) rather than an automaker the high valuation makes a lot more sense and might even be a bit cheap. And it's a safe bet that Ferrari which will celebrate its 75th anniversary next year and just reported that its order books are at record levels will be around and thriving for a long time yet.

Tesla faces new rivals in one of its fastest growing markets

Rich Smith (Enphase Energy): Everyone knows that Tesla builds electric cars and with $29.5 billion in automotive revenue in 2020 cars are inarguably Tesla's most important business -- for now. As competition ramps up in the electric car space however some analysts are starting to wonder if down the road the real money will be found in Tesla's energy generation and storage business and in particular in its batteries business.

Last month for example investment bank Canaccord Genuity made the case that as Tesla ramps up battery-production capacity beyond what it needs to supply its car business the company will increasingly shift to selling batteries to store solar energy generated by rooftop solar panels and utility-scale solar farms. Between 2020 and 2025 in fact Canaccord predicts that Tesla's battery business will quadruple in size to $8 billion. Moreover the bank forecasts a 25-fold increase in the profitability of the battery business as gross margins achieve the same 25% gross margin it forecasts for Tesla's cars.

And yet just as Tesla faces growing competition in the electric car space so too might it face growing competition from rivals that want a taste of those high profit margins in batteries and solar power. Take Enphase Energy for example. Up until last year Enphase ran in second place to SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG) in market share supplying the ""inverters"" needed to translate direct current solar power from solar panels into the alternating current used to run your A/C and charge your smartphone.

In 2021 however Enphase overtook SolarEdge in market share (now 48% versus 40%) and announced a new ""Encharge 10"" integrated home battery system as well -- a backup battery system that will compete directly with Tesla's own Powerpack offerings. Enphase now competes with Tesla's backup battery offerings in two ways: First it's an alternative to Tesla's in-house developed power inverters -- and a real rival given Enphase's now dominant market share in that business. Second Enphase's introduction of its own battery offering directly challenges Tesla's growth market in backup batteries themselves.

While its victory over Tesla is far from assured Enphase is a stock with momentum in this market -- and a good chance of giving Tesla a run for its money.",,,,,,,,,,,,

[2021],"Virtually every time you apply for a line of credit such as a credit card your credit report will be hit with a credit pull. But not every credit pull is equal and not every credit pull affects all of your credit scores.

This comprehensive article will first explain what credit pulls are and the difference between hard pulls and soft pulls. I’ll then show you how to find out which credit bureau (Experian TransUnion or Equifax) a bank will pull from when you apply for a credit card by utilizing credit databases.

What are credit pulls?

Credit pulls are when an entity usually a lender “pulls” your credit report to review your creditworthiness (i.e. how likely it is that you will responsibly borrow and pay back funds).

There are two different types of credit pulls: “soft pulls” and “hard pulls.” Knowing the difference between these two is very important.

Soft pulls

Soft pulls do not affect your credit score.

These can be done by lenders for things like pre-approvals but they are probably most commonly done when you check your credit score using something like Credit Karma or other times when something like a background check is done on you.

Hard pulls

Hard pulls are just like soft pulls except that they do affect your credit score. These are almost always done when you apply for a credit card or for any type of financing (home loans car loans etc.). And they can even happen for things like utilities and cell phones.

Unlike soft pulls you want to limit hard pulls because they affect your credit score as explained in more detail below.

How do credit pulls affect your credit score?

It’s really helpful to understand how credit pulls (hard pulls) affect your credit score.

Hard pulls affect the “New Credit” category of your FICO score which accounts for only 10% of your total credit score. Below is how your credit score is determined:

Payment History (35%)

Utilization (30%)

Credit History (15%)

New Credit (10%)

Mixed Credit (10%)

Each time your credit report is pulled your credit score will likely drop a few points typically 3 to 5 points. For people with more established credit profiles this drop might be even smaller. For people with weak credit scores this drop could be larger (even over 10 points.)

The good news is that your score will bump back up over the course of a few weeks or months. After 12 months the credit pull won’t even effect your FICO credit score and after two years it will drop off entirely. To read more about how hard inquiries affect your credit score click here.

Why does it matter which credit bureau will be pulled?

You might be wondering why it even matters which credit bureau will be pulling your credit score. Well there are a few important reasons why it matters.

Mitigate damage to your credit report

It’s important to give your credit report a break every now and again. By alternating credit bureaus pulled you’ll be able to mitigate the dings to your credit report.

For example if you have three recent hard inquiries on your Experian report and you can choose to apply for a card that will pull from only TransUnion that will allow you to give your Experian score a break.

Minimize appearance of hard pulls

Many credit card issuers don’t like to see a dozen plus inquiries over the past year or two so by trying to go for certain bureaus you can minimize the appearance of being a credit savage.

Using the same example as above if you were to apply to a bank that pulls TransUnion they would not technically see your recent Experian inquiries. So it would not look like you are aggressively pursuing credit as much as you are which is a good thing.

Utilizing your “cleanest” credit report

Some banks will not approve you if you have negative marks like late payments or collections on your credit report. So by knowing which banks pull which credit bureau you can avoid those banks at least until more time passes and your negative marks don’t mean as much.

It is not uncommon for derogatory remarks or certain types of negative reports on your credit to only be reported to one or two bureaus. Some banks will deny you even if those negative marks are very old. So if you have one report clean from any negative marks and you can rely on that one report for a credit card application that can help you get approved.

Utilize your highest credit score

Sometimes your credit score can vary dramatically between the bureaus in which case you’d obviously want to go for banks who might use your higher score.

Remember that just because one or two credit bureaus are pulled your new account will still likely show up on all three of the major credit bureaus. This is great because if you only have one good credit report like TransUnion you can leverage that one to get new cards which will eventually boost the score of your other credit reports!

Are credit pulls worth it?

Credit pulls are absolutely worth it when you’re able to secure a much-needed loan or pick up one of the best rewards credit cards.

When you’re earning hundreds (or even thousands of dollars) in credit card rewards a short-term ding on a credit report is well worth it.

How to find out which credit bureau will be pulled

The truth is that all we have are imperfect tools to work with to determine which credit bureau will be pulled.

With that said we also have certain trends that we can base our predictions on. These trends and tools can at least help us make an educated guess as to which bureau will be pulled.

I’ll start by identifying which credit card issuers are known for pulling certain bureaus and then get into the different methods for figuring out which bureau will be pulled by using databases.

Credit card issuer trends

The information below is based on my experience with dealing with these issuers for myself and for many others over the past few years. It’s also based on a review of the data found in CreditBoards. Understand that your experience could differ greatly from my findings below.

American Express

American Express loves to pull Experian.

For every single one of my Amex issued credit cards over the past few years they have always pulled from Experian (and only Experian). However sometimes they can mix it up and pull from another bureau like TransUnion. But if you apply for an Amex card you can almost always count on Experian being pulled.

Note: If you are a current Amex customer they typically only do a soft pull if they reject you for a credit card and sometimes only do a soft pull when they approve you!

Barclaycard

Barclaycard is great because they usually pull from TransUnion. This allows you to give your other credit reports a break as they’ll sometimes only pull from TransUnion (bot not always).

Capital One

Capital One likes to invite everybody to the party and they pull from each of the three credit bureaus. In the past you could freeze one bureau like Experian to save yourself the hard pull but recent data points show that’s not always successful.

This “freezing” technique can work for other credit card issuers too. But you need to pay close attention to what works and what doesn’t since these type of things can be in flux sometimes. For more info on this check out the DOC’s article here.

Chase

Chase is a hard one to predict. I’d say expect an Experian pull and one additional bureau but it could be very location-specific.

Citibank

Citibank will mostly pull from Experian and Equifax and in rare cases TransUnion. Expect for Citi to pull from at least two credit bureaus.

As you can tell it’s hard to pinpoint which bureau will be used for the credit pulls. But you can use the tool below to narrow your focus by region and potentially get a more accurate idea of what to expect.

Creditboards Credit Pull Database

The Credit Pull Database on Creditboards.com is the most popular source for checking which credit bureau will pull your credit for a credit application.

The key is to remember that the data you’ll find is usually self-reported. This means that it could be inaccurate outdated or perhaps even anomalous data that doesn’t accurately represent a given segment of society.

But that’s okay because at least we have guiding posts for the data on credit pulls.

As long as you always remember that the data you’re relying on may not be 100% correct in every scenario you won’t be surprised if your experience doesn’t accord with the data you found.

Using the Credit Pull Database

The Credit Pull Database is extremely easy to use.

Just click on this link and you’ll be able to search by the following criteria:

Consumer State

Credit Reporting Agency

Date applied

Approved

You do not have to select all of the details. I selected Texas and Equifax and found credit pulls data points for the following banks:

NFCU

Wells Fargo

Discover

PenFed

US Bank

USAA

Chase

In addition to the credit bureau data you can also see other relevant data points. You can see user details like:

The applicant’s ZIP Code

The date applied

Whether or not they were approved for the credit card

Their credit score

Credit limits

Random comments

The comments can be really helpful because you can find out if people were approved with things like bankruptcies on their credit report. Also if there were multiple credit bureaus pulled sometimes people will report them in the comments.

Alternative methods for finding credit pulls

Reddit spreadsheet

The folks over at Reddit have put together a spreadsheet with credit card application data. The spreadsheet includes even more criteria than CreditBoards such as income average age of accounts and how many accounts have been opened in the past 3 6 and 12 months.

This data is incredibly useful but may not be as voluminous as CreditBoards.

The data also might be skewed in favor of people with better credit scores since I imagine the demographics of those who frequent that forum are from more affluent sectors of society or at least have better credit scores.

Personal credit reports

You can also search your own credit reports to see which credit bureaus were pulled in the past. The issue with this is they they won’t show up beyond 2 years. Also the credit bureaus could change what bureaus they pull from.

You can check your credit score for free with Credit Karma (TransUnion and Equifax) and FreeCreditReport.com (Experian).

Credit card issuers who do soft pulls

Outside of the Amex exceptions mentioned above there aren’t many other issuers that will conduct a soft pull of your credit when applying for a credit card.

So what can you do?

You can try out something called the “Shopping Cart Trick.”

There are a few steps that you’ll need to follow but if you’re successful it’s actually possible to get approved for a credit card without ever having a hard pull on your credit card. It’s not going to be a huge credit line but at least it’s something.

Read more about how that method works here. Note that this method does not work as much as it used to.

Credit limit increases

Before you ever request a credit limit increase from a bank make sure you inquire with whether or not they conduct a hard pull on your credit report.

Amex

American Express will not conduct a hard pull when you request a credit limit increase. To request an increase you typically want your account to be open for 60 to 90 days and will likely shoot for an increase of 2X to 3X your credit. If you would like to find out more about how to request a credit limit increase with American Express click here.

Barclays

Barclays will usually do a hard pull when you request a credit limit increase but they are pretty generous when it comes to auto increases.

Capital One

Capital One will conduct a soft pull. You can find out more about how to get a credit increase with a Capital One here.

Chase

Chase will conduct a soft pull — read more about getting Chase credit limit increases here.

Citi

Citi will do both hard pulls and soft pulls but they should notify you beforehand. Just call the number on the back of your card to inquire with a rep of whether or not you’ll get a hard pull or soft pull. Read more about Citibank credit limit increases here.

Discover

The process varies for Discover. If they accept your initial request that’s usually a soft pull but if you’re trying to get a larger credit line increase then that could result in a hard pull.

Final word

In the end you’ll probably have to leave some of this stuff up to chance.

But it’s still a good idea to check these resources out so that you can at least give it a shot at trying to navigate your way through the hard pull landscape. Even if you only get it right 50% of the time those instances could still work in your advantage and allow you to minimize damage to your credit score.",,,,,,,,,,,,

MAGGIE FOUBERG/THE HOYA | Rising sophomores have raised concerns over dorm availability after the university announced Reynolds Hall and Copley Hall would shift from upperclassman housing to first-year dorms for the fall 2021 semester.

Reynolds Hall and Copley Hall formerly upperclass dorms will transition to first-year halls beginning in the fall 2021 semester according to Bill Huff director of residential services. These residential communities will join Darnall Hall New South and Harbin Hall as first-year dorms while Village C West will transition from a first-year to an upperclass hall.

Many rising sophomores are concerned about the change according to Natalie Gilbert (COL ’24).

“It feels unfair that Copley will be given to freshmen” Gilbert said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Personally I have a group of friends that had hoped to get a Copley suite so that we could be connected to each other while still having our own roommates. And Copley is now for freshmen that don’t have big groups like that so now it takes those spots away from people that do.”

Copley Hall includes many suites with two double-occupancy rooms connected by a shared bathroom distinguishing the hall from upperclass dorms like Southwest Quad’s Kennedy and McCarthy Halls which only have traditional single double or triple rooms with communal bathrooms. Before this shift there were no first-year living communities with suite-style rooms.

The goal of these changes is to offer more housing variety to first-year students while maintaining comfortable housing for all students according to Huff.

“The adjustments will ensure that the University continues to provide attractive safe and comfortable spaces conducive to student formation and community building for all students while creating more equity of housing types for incoming first year students” Huff wrote in an email to The Hoya.

While Copley will no longer be available for sophomore students Village C East which offers double rooms with private bathrooms will remain an option. The university fully renovated both VCE and VCW in the past year including lobby renovations that created additional community and study space according to Huff.

While rooms in VCE and VCW have private bathrooms their average square footage — at about 200 and 186 square feet — is less than the average Copley room’s 212 square feet.

Upperclass students will continue to live in McCarthy Hall and Kennedy Hall. Rooms in these buildings are also smaller than Copley rooms with an average size of 176 square feet.

For Katarina Junod (SFS ’24) the fact that the university will provide first-year students with larger rooms and additional private bathrooms is frustrating.

“I feel like the change in housing of sophomore housing going to freshmen will mean that some sophomores will have housing that is worse than freshmen housing. That feels unfair” Junod said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya.

While other suite- and apartment-style buildings are available for upperclass students these traditionally go to juniors and seniors as rising sophomores’ fewer housing selection points limit their options. Without Copley sophomores’ only options are traditional dorm rooms.

According to Junod the communication process surrounding the changes to residence halls was lacking and may prevent sophomores from making informed decisions about their housing. In recent weeks Residential Living held several information sessions about housing for students and plans to hold more in the near future according to a university spokesperson.

The administration should have provided more information to rising sophomores according to Junod.

“I feel like you have to go to other people that are upperclassmen to understand what is going on with housing and I don’t feel like that should be an issue. I feel like Georgetown should properly communicate what’s happening with housing” Junod said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWpvdXJuYWwuaWUvc3Rvcmllcy1vZi1wZW9wbGUtYW5kLWhvdXNpbmctaW4taXJlbGFuZC01NDMwOTU5LU1heTIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'I feel constant shame at our situation': Your stories of Ireland's housing crisis,"THIS WEEK WE asked our readers to share their housing stories.

We wanted to take a snapshot of housing in 2021 – what sort of situations people live in; how they got where they are; what issues they experienced and what barriers they have faced.

Housing has been an ongoing issue for Ireland over the decades and this year more than ever the fractures in housing supply have become apparent.

What we discovered from our callout was that people have not felt heard. A common line in the emails we received was ‘thank you’ – people were grateful to get their chance to tell their story.

You will read stories from people who have just moved here from abroad; people wondering should they move abroad; long-term renters who can’t move on; buyers who have hit snags and legal issues.

What the stories show is that we need to move away from the presumptions and stereotypes around housing in Ireland. There are clearly issues for many in finding affordable homes – not just families or couples.

Many of the people who wrote to us feel unsupported by the government and afraid for their future. Yet there are others too who feel lucky and are living in their dream home.

Here are their stories:

‘I was given a 100% mortgage – and a €20k loan’

“I moved to Sligo and a year later I decided to see if I could get a mortgage to buy a house. I was confident the bank would say no as I had no savings at all! BOI said no problem and handed me a 100% mortgage there and then. I hesitated said no point me taking a mortgage as I had no savings to decorate a new house buy furniture etc. BOI said no problem here is a loan for €20k on top of the 100% mortgage!

“By 2009 I was in serious trouble trying to pay back the mortgage loan and a credit card. BOI extended my loan to clear the credit card which was then cancelled. In 2013 following the recession I had to move to another county for work so I rented out the house in Sligo and rented a room the new county. The rent in Sligo didn’t cover the mortgage so I was paying rent and into the mortgage.

“In the 8 years I lived in the other county there was no way I could afford to rent on my own or have any thought of another mortgage – the Sligo house was still in negative equity. The eight years of living in a house share was hell. The Covid pandemic had a silver lining for me. The company I work for has adopted a flexible working policy and I was able to move back to the Sligo house.

“But I know I am one of the very lucky ones.”

‘I feel very let down by the government’

“I’m married with children. Long-term renting. Currently paying €2500 per month in rent. No affordable houses to buy. I’ve contacted countless politicians over the years and no one has ever replied to me.

“I’m 46 and my children have moved countless times over the years. Feel very let down by the government.”

Keith: ‘We feel trapped’

“Myself and my wife are in our thirties and have been in private rental accommodation at the same property for over a decade. I’m on around €25K a year through long term employment and my wife is on Disability Allowance of €90 a week.

“When we first moved in in 2010 the rent was €600. This was increased to €800 in 2018. It has never included any kind of utilities. I consider us luckier than a lot of people since we were approved for HAP in late 2020 (we were approved for the council housing list but told the wait would be very long so HAP would suit us more) which brings our rent payments down to around €340 a month.

“We feel trapped nonetheless as the income limits for mortgages pretty much mean we can never get a house on my income even though we’re able to manage any repayments given we’ve been renting for so long and have enough savings for a deposit.

“I feel something has to be done to enable low income households to be able to buy a house. ”

James: ‘We’ve been priced out of Dublin and Wicklow’

“I am a public servant and my partner is in education. We’re in our forties and have rented all our lives and are finally able to buy due to a promotion I got which allowed us to accelerate our paltry savings.

“The ex-council houses in the Dublin suburb I’m from are now €400k so we started looking at Wicklow only to find ourselves priced out of there too. Now we’re looking at Wexford.

“Public housing sell-off was the worst thing that ever happened here it created an explosion in house values that successive subsequent governments have nurtured instead of providing a framework to allow people to provide for their pensions that doesn’t involve ever-increasing inflation of residential property prices.

“This policy will remake the old landlord and tenant classes in this country. We need to make housing a right not a retirement nest-egg. I would happily watch the value of whatever house we buy decrease to achieve this it’s the right thing to do as a society.”

Daniel: ‘This was my last chance to buy a reasonably priced house’

“At the beginning of 2020 I found a lovely house tucked away in West Cork for a reasonable price very close to my job had enough money to buy it. The seller accepted my offer but then the trouble started. There were several boundary issues Covid had just arrived so the surveyor stopped working the solicitors were just getting used to working from home and there was very little being done to progress the sale all throughout the lockdown.

“After about a year of dilly-dallying it transpired that there were two people with a right of residence to this property and these proved impossible to remove. While trying to buy the place I moved into three different short-term rentals hoping it would be sorted soon. About halfway through I had given up and pulled out the seller contacted me assuring me they were going to solve the problems so I gave them another chance.

“Then eventually the seller pulled out and quickly re-advertised the property for an additional €50000 but soon removed the ad. The house still hasn’t been sold boundary and title issues still unresolved. Prices in the area have sky-rocketed since working from home became a thing.

“Looks like this was my last chance at buying a reasonably-priced house in West Cork until the next recession.”

‘I consider our situation to be extremely lucky’

“Myself and my partner are both in our mid-30s. We bought our house initially in Dublin 13 back in 2014 a relatively run-down rental property for €250000. We renovated the property extending it landscaping the gardens and improving the BER.

“By January 2020 our financial circumstances had changed favourably and we decided to go back to the market look at properties in a more desirable location. We were thinking long-term and that the ‘new house’ would be the forever home.

“We placed our property on the market with an asking price of €360000. We had several bidders engaging with our estate agent via virtual viewings to the point where two / three bidders refused to be outbid. We took a decision to engage with the bidders directly allowing them to view our property for 15 minutes at a time where we were not present in the property. We secured a buyer. The final sale agreed price was €427000 far exceeding our expectations but a reflection of the market today.

“At the same time we secured another older property in Dublin 5. We had no issues with our buying process as the transaction was completed via our own selling agent who was dealing with the vendor of the new property. We paid the asking price of €595000.

“I consider our situation to be extremely lucky. You hear that trading up is incredibly stressful but in the current market I think it can work to your advantage particularly where you are working with an agent who has properties for sale where you want to buy.

“One misconception is that vendors are driving prices upwards but from our viewpoint it was the buyers who drove up the price due to lack of supply. The whole market needs urgent and serious regulation by government – it makes absolutely no sense at the moment.

Our purchasing budget was in the region of €650000 and we quickly realised that we would even struggle in a bidding war at that level which may sound shocking to some readers.

Jonathan: ‘Homes are out of my mortgage limit – so I’m going to move to the Middle East and save’

“I’m currently working as a public service employee on 55k. I moved home to my parents’ house a few years ago to save for a mortgage. I was renting five years previously.

“I have a €30k deposit however both housing and apartment prices in Dublin are beyond my mortgage limit with the average house price over 350k. My social family and work life is in Dublin. I do not believe I should be forced to move further away due to housing costs.

“With the current market and lack of leadership from government to address the situation in the short term I do not envisage this problem resolving for at least another 10 years (if ever). My plan now is to enjoy the rest of my 30s with a plan to migrate to the Middle East at 40. My current role will secure me 90k per annum tax free job. I hope to save a substantial amount of that (€50k) and return within five years hopefully with enough to pay for the majority of the cost of a house with the remainder from a mortgage or loan.

“This is not ideal with my preference to stay in Dublin but I need security for the future.”

‘I’m two months into repaying my mortgage with no house to show for it’

“I am 39 single and a first-time buyer. Having finally saved up and secured mortgage approval I went sale agreed on a second-hand house last summer. The sale has been fraught with delays and false horizons and it was six months before the vendor finally signed the contracts.

“My solicitor drew down my mortgage and shortly after it transpired that the vendors had not been making repayments on their mortgage with a vulture fund who then intervened and have been frustrating the sale since. I am now two months into repaying my mortgage with no house to show for it and facing the prospect of having to return my loan to my lender and start from scratch in a much less favourable market not to mention my losses of around €5k in legal fees etc. I have also given up my lease and have moved home ‘temporarily’.

“I don’t understand why purchasers have so few rights – if I had breached the contract the vendors would have been entitled to keep my €30k deposit; all I seem to have is the right to a lengthy and costly pursuit of them for my costs in the district court.”

Dave: ‘We bought during the boom’

“My wife and I bought an apartment in suburban Dublin in late 2007 at the height of the property boom. We have been living there since and saving to move to a larger house. The price of the property has never come back to its original purchase price. If we sold now we would still be down 100k from what we paid.

“Considering we have been there 14 years paying the mortgage if we sold now we would probably walk away with a small debt. We are nearly there with a 20% deposit for a larger property but had our eye on a specific development as our kids are in school and sport clubs in this area and the price for us was doable. That’s gone now as all of these new properties have been bought by a fund.

“We have bad experiences with these funds. A fund has bought the properties beside us and they are all in disrepair. The tenants are paying top rents but don’t care about the upkeep of them and from the rents they are paying I wouldn’t blame them. ”

‘We’re self-employed – our mortgage approval dropped to €147k’

“In 2011 my partner and I put a deposit down on a house which fell through. We decided to rent in the area while we waited for another house in our budget to go on the market. The following year my husband was made redundant. Now with both of us self employed we had to restart the mortgage application process again.

“We managed to hang on to our deposit and eventually after three years reapplied. Now with two babies and both of us self employed our mortgage approval dropped to €147000 – despite the rent we’d been paying for the last number of years being more than the mortgage repayment.

“Last year I applied for the affordable housing scheme and was approved in principle. Houses recently came up in our area. When I applied again I was told as we both work in live events and had availed of the PUP payment we were no longer eligible. We’d killed ourselves using our combined PUP payments to cover our rent terrified of ruining our credit rating. We were told to reapply when we had two full calendar years of wage subsidy free income.

“If we are back to normal by next January we are eligible to reapply for the scheme again in 2025.”

‘As a single person I’m very limited with what I can buy’

“I’m a single teacher in my mid-30s trying to save a deposit for a house. I’m renting in Kilkenny. I’m lucky that I am house-sharing in lovely accommodation but I would love to buy my own place in Kilkenny ideally a new build so that I can avail of the help to buy scheme.

“Unfortunately as a single person I am very limited with what I can buy and the cheapest new builds in Kilkenny are €350000 which is over €150000 outside my budget.”

It’s very frustrating that the housing market in Ireland is geared towards couples. It seems like single people are very much at a disadvantage especially if you want to buy in the likes of Kilkenny.

Nathalie: ‘There can be such stigma around renting’

“I’m a long-term renter and before my now husband and I moved in together he had been living with his parents. I find it frustrating that the housing crisis narrative so often focuses on home ownership as the ultimate goal. I’ve always strived to make wherever we live a home but there can be such stigma around renting versus owning.

“My husband and I both picked creative careers; we appreciate that we’re not as attractive mortgage candidates as people in more stable professions and that it means we may need to rent to stay in the area where we want to live and where we’d like our son to grow up.

“And while we’re okay with that we’ve experienced having to clear out of our rental home with just a few week’s notice and the gut-wrenching stress of scrambling to find a new place to live.

“Why can’t we incentivise long-term leases? Allow people to feel secure that their rental house would be their home – that they won’t be forced to make their kids change schools because their house is being sold or turned into an Airbnb. Allow renters to make our home feel like us – let us use our own furniture let us paint update and improve our homes without fear of losing our security deposit. It’s a model that works in so many European cities I don’t know why it can’t work here.”

Daniel: ‘We can’t compete with investment funds’

“Myself and my partner are young professionals in well-paid jobs. We got outbid on a three-bed duplex in south Dublin in the last few weeks. It was newly built in 2018 and sold for €505000.

“Asking price this February was €625000 (28% increase in three years no work done to it). It went sale agreed to a cash buyer for €650000. We can’t compete with these investment funds!”

‘We’re seen as a liability because we’re in the creative industry’

“Myself and my boyfriend are both 30 years old – we have good jobs in the creative industry earning a combined income of 110k. We save about €1500 a month.

“My father died a few years ago and I got a small sum of money – I always thought this would be a big help. We have on top of that saved approx €30k ourselves and now have about €42k for a deposit. We want to live in Dublin we are born and bred here.

“When we went for mortgage approval we had to jump through hoops as our field of work is fixed contract based meaning we get rolling year contracts – obviously with this we are seen as potentially a liability – despite never having been unemployed since we started after college.

“We house shared for years but being 30 now and the working from home situation we decided to get our own place – we overnight increased our rent by €1000. We were informed where we moved into used to be an Airbnb pre-covid.

“Last year when we were in the stages for mortgage approval we were approved for 3.5 times our salary as no exceptions are being made on mortgages – we had very limited places to apply to because of our contracts and it wasn’t a great rate offered. We had €380k approved + the €42k saved so €425k.

“Every house we bid on starting at 365+ went for well over 400k – we were told we needed proof of finances to see properties. One house we went into had a rats nest in the back one place we needed a hard hat from falling roof. ‘Potential’ we were told.

“Why should we have to move out of Dublin and leave our families despite us working 9-5 and paying huge tax bills per month?

“We decided to rent to clear our heads – we are considering moving abroad now. It isn’t even the ‘owning a house’ status I am obsessed with – it is paying these huge rents no stability or lease contracts lasting over a year and paying someone else’s mortgage.

“We stepped into college during the recession came out at peak to a limited job market – saved paid our way and declared any supplemental income for what?

I love this city but it has no place for people like us anymore.

Brian: ‘I often have to move home due to rent increases’

“I’m 34 and I’ve been working full time since I left school. I’ve been renting all my life living with friends in the same situation as me. We cannot afford to save for a house while paying rent.

“I often have to move home as the rent increases every two years and I feel like I can never settle down. I met my partner two years ago who is 35 and also lives in a house share. We are considering moving country to get a home as the outlook here is so grim it is unbearable.

“I see no future here despite paying taxes all my life and everything keeps getting more expensive. Out of a circle of about 20 friends only two have mortgages and we’re all in the 29 – 35 age bracket. The constant thought of being evicted and having to look to rent somewhere else hangs over my head every time I get an email or a call from my landlord.

“Why won’t this government help us…”

‘I was homeless and on HAP – now I’m facing homelessness again’

“I came into my present accommodation from homelessness in 2016. Homeless HAP was a great help to me at the time. Since moving in I have always paid my rent on time and have been a good tenant.

“Now my landlord is planning to sell the property and so I have been looking for a new flat. In Dublin it’s extremely expensive and landlords are very reluctant to accept HAP. This is usually because they are not registered and are trying to avoid taxes and inspection of their properties.

“I have been on Dublin City Council housing waiting list for six years and am still at position 115. The over reliance on private rentals means that tenure is insecure and greedy unscrupulous landlords can act with impunity.

“I am a HAP tenant but I am also a responsible person trying to secure a decent place to live. I am on a Disability Allowance and am once again facing the possibility of homelessness due to the discrimination against HAP applicants.”

‘House prices have almost doubled since we moved in’

“Myself and my partner have lived in a rented house in the city centre for six years. We want to buy in our area and be in 15-minute walking distance to the city centre as we are now so we’ve been keeping an eye on houses around the Liberties/Blackpitts/the Tenters for years.

“Despite both working in well paid tech jobs that allow us to save and pay our rent that luckily has been relatively stable it’s difficult to see us being able to afford any house that we could make our long-term home.

The house prices in this area have almost doubled since we moved in and currently any house we see coming up for €350k – 400k in our area is either tiny in terrible condition or intentionally priced low to get people’s attention before the price rockets up or a bidding war breaks out.

“We are incredibly lucky to be in the position we’re in both with our rent and our jobs but even for us it seems impossible to imagine owning a small home with the potential room to start a family anywhere in the area we live even though just six years ago that goal seemed eminently achievable if we saved our deposit (when we moved here we thought 250k – 300k max would be what we should spend on a house).

“At this stage we’re considering going back to my partners home country even though we want to stay here in Dublin.

“As someone in my early 30s who saw so many people just a few years older than myself get caught in the crash only a decade ago I’m wary of paying an inflated value for a house and don’t want to be left in the situation so many people were in if the market goes bust again.”

Adam: ‘We’re working and renting – but finding it hard to get a mortgage’

“Together with my wife we arrived to Ireland in 2007 and since then we are renting from private landlords. As there was problem with accommodation for my wife’s parents we bought a house in Poland which currently as we were thinking to buy something in Ireland to stop paying rent is putting us as second time buyers. This is increasing the deposit amount we have to put together.

“Also even though we are both working and paying big rent we won’t get a mortgage as we have two children. We looked for a house where we will have to pay nearly three times less on a monthly basis than now we are paying for rent.

“As long as we could afford to pay for rent we will stay in Ireland otherwise we will need to leave.

The government was trying to stop the increase in rent prices but there is not many properties to be rent so the landlords are still doing what they want. I’m happy that I have a landlord which doesn’t increase my rent all the time but I know many people who were told you have to pay more or you have to leave.”

‘I want to live in an apartment – not a house’

“I’m an apartment dweller who doesn’t want to live in a house. I’m a 49-year-old born and bred in Dublin engaged to my partner and renting in Dun Laoghaire a two-bed apartment. One of very few places that are pet friendly so we pay €2250 a month as a result. We dislike that Irish apartments are all furnished so can’t make like a home.

“We’re thinking about buying but at €400k budget Irish property is such poor value for money in terms of quality and availability.

Our thoughts are of keeping money for cash buying in Cyprus Greece Poland where a new two-bed apartment in eg central Poznan costs €85k. We would rent it out and then retire to it.

‘We moved house but now we don’t like our neighbours’

“Our story starts thankfully with good jobs earning approximately €60-65k between us both (before tax). We were lucky to live with parents and pay a small rent there.

“My partner ended up moving in with me and my parents and paying rent there too due to his job. We then started trying for a family and not thinking we would be lucky so quickly panic stations kicked in to get a home. We were saving between €500-600 per month before we got pregnant then we upped the payments to about €800 between us in late 2019.

“We could not believe our luck and we were granted in principle within the week.

“Now due to the housing shortage there was only one local estate where we could buy and get the help to buy scheme which was 5% at the time and we were able to claim between 11-12k. We put a deposit down on the house in September and then got the keys on the first Thursday of lockdown. Our newborn was less than a month old otherwise the sale would have fallen through as I would have been on maternity leave and the bank would have asked for updated bank slips.

“We moved in a month after getting the keys. Now we have a social house beside us who moved in in December 2020 and we have nothing but headaches. It is making us dislike the house now when we loved where we lived and was a nice quiet area until December.

“We don’t know where to start now if we want to move house due to these neighbours. It is hard to find a few thousand when paying a mortgage and raising a family.”

‘Second-time buyers like us are left in an awful situation’

“I am profoundly deaf and married with children. We moved up to Newbridge Kildare in 2010. We bought a council house in Listowel Co Kerry. My husband’s job was transferred to Dublin. My children needed to go to deaf schooling in Dublin for post-primary. Since 2010 we have been renting we are still renting and paying mortgage for our Kerry house.

“We been trying all banks affordable housing scheme we have been refused. In our situation we have no choices but to continue renting with very high price in Newbridge. We couldn’t sell our Kerry house because we would be in the minus equity.

“So we rent our Kerry house the rent is very low in Listowel which left us to pay extra for the mortgage and rent in Newbridge. So we couldn’t sell our Kerry house. We are living fearful because the rent keeps going up. We really want to buy our own home in Newbridge. I feel the second-time buyers are left in an awful situation like ours for a reason that is so unfair.”

‘We have pretty much accepted that our family is unlikely to own a home’

“Myself and my partner are in our forties with one child. We have never owned any property. We are renting our current home for the last six years the rent is €1200 per month. We have never missed a payment or been late paying our rent.

“I work full-time and my partner part-time together we earn a combined annual salary of €55000 before taxes. Over the years we have managed to save almost €50000 for a deposit. With the bank lending only 3.5 our combined income we could only get a mortgage for €192500 max plus our deposit this is well under the price of any house in our area which we want to stay in because our child loves the school they are in.

“I feel we are running out of time even though we continue to scrimp and save the older we get the harder it will be to find a bank to lend to us. We have pretty much accepted that we are likely never to own our own home. We’ve stopped looking online it’s too depressing.

“Our dream is to buy a little piece of land and build a small eco home. This now feels completely out of reach.”

‘The odds are stacked against single buyers’

“I’m a single person attempting the impossible task of buying solo in Dublin. I’m 35 and I have a good permanent public sector job. I’ve rented in Dublin for the last seven years. I am ‘lucky’ that my rent is reasonable compared to some. So it’s allowed me build a deposit. However I live with three others in a house share and I’ve reached the point where I want my own space.

“I got my mortgage approval in January. But despite earning nearly 30 grand over the average industrial wage I haven’t been able to buy. I’m from Dublin I work in Dublin live in Dublin; my life is here. Yet it’s looking like I can barely even afford an apartment here. New builds and therefore the HTB is out of my budget.

“New build apartments aren’t for sale because they are being bought by REIT. It’s so frustrating to see investors buying up whole estates/apartment blocks. I can’t compete with cash buyers or investors with the ability to pay way over the odds. I also earn too much to qualify for the Rebuilding Ireland scheme. My parents have said they will try help me bump up my deposit but they shouldn’t have to. I’ve done everything in my control and it’s still not enough.

“The media focus is mainly on families with children but the odds are stacked against single buyers so much more. I won’t have a family until my housing situation is more secure – so that part of my life is on hold for the foreseeable.”

‘We were told it’ll be another two years before our mortgage is approved’

“My husband and I returned to Ireland after six years abroad in March 2020 with our son. My husband started a job the week we got back and I started work in the autumn. We are both on contracts as is very common in our industries.

“We stay half the week at each of our parents’ houses because they very kindly share childcare of our son while we work during the week. Because of moving back in with our parents and not having to pay for childcare we have been able to save a sizeable amount and went to apply for an 80% mortgage last month.

But were told unless one of us gets made permanent we will have to wait a further two years before we’ll get approved.

“This means we are now looking to rent and will be paying twice what we would have paid in monthly mortgage repayments to a landlord.”

‘I lived in hostels for two years’

“I am a mature student in the West of Ireland and I am living rent-free with my mother.

“I am six years on the local authority list and I am in line for a one-bedroom apartment from the city council.

“Previously I lived in hostels for over two years. Last year I rented and it was an awful experience as I had no job but I stayed there for college funding reasons.”

‘We are mortgage prisoners’

“In 2005 we bought our first home 80km south of where we’d lived and worked for the previous five years to buy something we could afford. We mortgaged to the max. We commuted for as long as we could then I stopped working to look after our children – the cost of childcare was too high for me to remain in work.

“We’ve struggled and been told by the bank that they will sell the house from under us in the past as we tried to keep our heads above water. Nowadays we’re in a better position through hard work and determination but we are now mortgage prisoners.

“We bought our property for €318000 in 2005 and later that year took out a loan to clear unsecured debts topping it up to €360000. The bank was more than happy to value the property at this price. 14 years later last year in an attempt to bring down our mortgage rate of over 4% we had our property valued by ‘one of the bank’s panel’.

“We hoped with all the work we’d struggled to do to the house and every spare cent that we’d recently sunk into the mortgage bringing it down to €270000 that it might now be valued at €300000. No such luck. €245000 was the valuer’s decision so we’re stuck with one of the highest mortgage rates in Europe still deemed to be in negative equity and no hope of bringing down our mortgage value and our rate any time soon even when we overpay as often as we can.

“How can banks decide the value of your property when they loan against it and then ensure it’s valued another way once they have you locked into a mortgage?”

Our advice to our kids will be to never buy. If it’s too expensive to rent in Ireland leave and take your skills and education with you.

Cillian: ‘There is basically nothing I can get in Dublin for €220k’

“I’m in my twenties and moved to Dublin to work three years ago. I am currently renting near the city with five others. The rent is €4350 a month of which I pay €750.

“I’ve been looking at buying a house for over a year now as my mortgage payment would only be marginally higher than what I am currently paying in rent and I would be hoping to rent out a second bedroom under the ‘rent a room scheme’ which would significantly reduce my mortgage payment.

“I’ve got approval in principle for €185500 mortgage and I have saved €35500 as a deposit over the past three years. A total buying power of around €220000. As I’m sure you know there is basically nothing in Dublin I can get for this.

“My only hope would be to avail of an exemption from the mortgage lending rules which would push my buying power to around €275000. The range of houses I would be looking at are all around the €290000 to €300000 which is basically the baseline for a house in Dublin and the quality is generally very poor.

“I have been to look at two houses both of which sold for about €15-20k over asking which is just too far outside my budget.”

I am starting to think I should just give up looking now but paying €9000 a year in rent with nothing to show for it at the end is just sickening.

Luke: ‘There was mould and insects coming out of the walls’

“I’m a student and lived in an apartment block owned by IRES REIT for a year. Me and my girlfriend lived in the apartment block for a year and as soon as we moved in there were problems with damp.

“We brought it to the attention of IRES REIT the apartment maintenance company even sent a report about it to the RTB. Nothing was ever done and we moved out at the end of the lease due to black mould spreading across the walls insects coming out from behind skirting boards just horrible stuff that made the whole experience of living there unlivable.

“The rent for this place was over €1300 a month not including bills. The only consolation was that we didn’t have to fight to get the deposit back. We were both working as well and found it extremely difficult to get by during this time. The fact the apartment being full of mould while living there made paying so much left such a sour taste in my mouth.”

Aisling: ‘I drove by and realised someone else was living in the house’

“In 2008 I put a deposit on a house in Co Kildare but then the old affordable housing scheme made property available in in Co Wicklow. I put down the deposit and had the snag list done – then when driving by realised somebody was living in the house. So another house in the same development was offered.

“My solicitor was waiting for contracts which never came but I was allowed move into the house. I then had to fight for years to be allowed pay rent. It has subsequently been discovered the building were so structurally unsound they could not sell them.

“I was moved out in 2019 so work could be done on my house and two years later am still in a very unsuitable property. In January I was offered a different house which was perfect for me. I had a builder call the day before Patrick’s day to say the house was given to somebody else.

“I have a deposit and approval and want to hand back the council house but I am limited to second-hand houses to fix up which the help to buy scheme won’t help.”

‘I’m lucky – I got an affordable house. The Government must replicate this scheme’

“I am one of the lucky ones to get an actual affordable house from the O’Cualann group in Poppintree in Ballymun. I paid €178k for a three-bed house and my mortgage is less than €700pm. The house is A2 rated and less than 20 mins to city centre. O’Cualann still made a profit on this.

“If O’Cualann with Government support can do this then the Government MUST replicate this and similar schemes across the country at scale. Affordable housing would be the number 1 vote getter in every constituency in the country.

“Everyone is entitled to aspire to be a homeowner and it shouldn’t be a pipe dream. I am very aware of how lucky I am to be in my own affordable house but it shouldn’t come down to luck it should be Government policy for all its citizens.”

‘I don’t know anyone who bought a house without a gift or inheritance’

“I moved to Dublin in 2012 paying €700 a month for a one-bed apartment in the city centre. Here I am a decade later in my 30s paying €1000 a month for a single room in a shared apartment.

“Throughout that time I have been saving assiduously living far from extravagantly have accrued absolutely zero personal debt and have completed two degrees off my own back allowing me to secure a really really good job with excellent pay and benefits.

“I still have absolutely no chance of buying a house in Dublin. Literally no chance. Even getting a 10% deposit together for an entry-level apartment is beyond me given how much I have to spend on rent. Shared equity and help to buy schemes are no use to me because I’m single.

“How can I be in the top percentage of earners of my age have saved a good amount from every paycheck for a decade have no long-term financial liabilities and still be nowhere near home ownership? How is this not a system failure?

“I do not know one person my age who has bought a house (or even rented anywhere more upmarket than a literal bedsit!) without a large gift/inheritance from parents. I don’t begrudge those people what they have been given but the system can’t be set up like this.

“The fact that marriage or wealthy parents or both are necessary ingredients in getting secure property in Dublin is a genuinely psychologically damaging weight. There is no conceivable route out of it. I will be renting until I emigrate retire (at which point my State pension won’t cover my rent so I’ll presumably be made homeless) or die.”

‘I live in a log cabin in my parents’ back garden’

“I am a 32-year-old single female and work as a nurse. I’ve worked in Dublin since I was 22 and bounced from rental to rental for almost 10 years. Landlords used any excuse to get new tenants every year. Absolute lies I was told:

the apartment was going up for sale the house was being demolished

the owner died and we had to move out

“Then low and behold the property would be up within three months for rent again and the cost up by €200 or €300. Thankfully in 2020 I got a new job and I could move back home. I had zero savings to my name.

“I was financially forced to live with my parents for eight months while I decided what to do. I was very lucky to have understanding parents and they let me build a very small log cabin in their back garden at the end of 2020.

“No bank will give loans to build a log cabin. It’s deemed a self build and if you don’t have planning permission it’s a no go. I had to be very creative in getting €35000 to build my one-bed log cabin. Now I am very happy residing in my tiny house. I know it’s not ideal I am at my parents’ back door and I have the bare minimal privacy but it’s my own space. And in five years’ time I will have paid off my ‘little mortgage’.

I cannot see myself ever buying a house. I just cannot afford it. And after 10 years of sharing with strangers I never want to do that again.

Matt: ‘We got a house through sheer luck’

“I’ll preface this by saying that myself and my wife are in a stronger position than most first time buyers with a well paid steady job (single income wife is a freelancer) and a parent who has helped us out with the deposit.

“We moved back from central Europe 18 months ago looking to settle in Dublin. We did our homework regarding budgeting for a house. We applied for a mortgage in July and we got approval for 3.5x salary giving us a budget of around €350k to get a decent house.

“When we started looking quite a few of the houses needed extensive renovation work. We didn’t have enough in our budget for this nor did we have enough to win the bidding wars we always encountered.

“We finally did find a place to live that’s amenable to us and we have done this through sheer luck. We were approved for a 4x salary mortgage and snapped up a sale that fell through.

“Although we are the lucky ones it has still been a struggle and we have paid over €30k in rent since we moved home!”

David: ‘The bank wouldn’t recognise my wife’s shift allowance’

‘We’re a married couple in our 30s transitioning from renters to first time buyers. We have been renting the same place in D20 for the past six years and just signed contracts to purchase a new build three-bed house in another part of the area.

“We both work full time in relatively well paid jobs. The major issue other than availability we had was the bank not recognising my wife’s shift allowance when calculating our salary even though it is guaranteed and been consistent.

“The allowance is 9k which in terms of a mortgage is about 32k less than they were willing to lend. We decided to get the head down and save for another year as a result or we would have been priced out of any new build developments in Dublin.

“We were open to pre-owned homes but found that across the board the initial asking price versus the eventual selling price was so far removed that it was impossible to know if a home was within our budget until you were quite a long way down the road of trying to buy it!

“We had been liaising with the selling agent of the new development for six months waiting for the next phase to open. When it did it was a virtual launch that meant we had to await an email to tell us to register for a place in the queue. There were only about 20 houses in this phase so our success was going to come down to if we were quick enough to spot that one email coming in and then respond to it quickly enough.

“Luckily we did and secured a house the next day but there would have many who did not. The house is due to be built by Q4 2021/Q1 2022. By then it will have been two years since we first applied for a mortgage.”

Cillian: ‘I bought a house needing full renovation for €135k’

“I am a 27-year-old from the mid west I rented in Galway for almost 10 years between college and working. Due to travel with work I no longer needed to be in Galway and decided I would move home a large town in the mid west and buy a house.

“In 2017 I had decided to start really saving for a house in the knowledge that as a single person I would never be able to afford to buy a new build as I earn €35000. The cheapest new builds in my home town are at least €270000

“I applied for a mortgage last May I am lucky to have worked the whole way through the pandemic and I started to house hunt. Last October I bought a 110-year-old 3-bed terrace house in need of near full renovation for €132000.

“I have spent the last seven months of weekends and holidays DIY renovating the house directly hiring an electrician plumber and plasterer. I am still not moved in as I have spent all money and have to wait until my next paycheck to complete the next items. Hopefully I will move in some point during the summer.”

‘I’m 54 and renting’

I’m 54 single and renting. Bought with another about 20+ years ago and one year later it was over. It sold for not much more than bought so not much in the line of profit. I’m renting since.

“I want my own place but I’m not a first time buyer. I don’t have savings of 40k minimum! Not renting in Dublin! I have worked all my life.

“My housemate couldn’t pay anymore end last year so I had to find somewhere else to live… I’m now in Graiguenamanagh – not by choice! This will not be permanent or else I will move into Leinster House.”

Rachel: ‘We’re at the mercy of landlords’

“I’ve been renting since 2018. My rent is €762.50 a month and for that I get a decent apartment in Clontarf with my flatmate. But we’re still at the mercy of landlords.

“We’re lucky that our landlord is sound but he’s in 70s so if he decides to sell we have to find a new place. Saving for a mortgage is so hard but I do my best. But I just don’t feel I’ll ever get there.

“My mother died last year and left me a small inheritance which makes me extremely lucky but even then my salary means I couldn’t afford a house in Dublin or Kildare where I’m originally from.

“My Dad keeps telling me that renting is a waste of money but I don’t know what else I can do. Living at home isn’t really a feasible option and I want to spend my young years in the capital near my work and friends.

But I’m terrified that even with a partner we wouldn’t be able to afford anything in Dublin Kildare Meath or Wicklow. I feel trapped and I don’t see how it’s going to get any better. My parents bought a house aged 24 and 27. I’ll be lucky to get one before I’m 30.

‘I’m 30 and I’m going to be living with my parents for the next seven or eight years’

“I turn 30 this year and live with my parents. In January 2020 I stopped renting in Dublin so I could start saving money. I thought I would be closer to owning my own home by now but the reality has set in over the last year that I’m going to be living with my parents and saving for another 7-8 years before I can afford a house at the current prices.

“And 7-8 years from now the price of houses will be higher than they are now. Even the smallest limit on the Affordable Housing Scheme is well above what I can afford so I don’t understand what’s ‘affordable’ about it. I feel like I’m left in a stalemate with my life on hold.”

‘In 2016 we lost our home’

So we are married 28 years with grown up kids. We have worked hard thankfully never had to depend on social welfare and the mortgage was always the priority. Recession 2008 hit and getting paid became impossible.

“We always engaged and payed full payments or what we could. We cut our lifestyle back lived on a very small income but sadly in 2016 we lost our home. Since then we have been renting minimum €1500 a month saving for a deposit to buy again as we can’t continue this.

“We now need 20% banks won’t accommodate us as the old mortgage is still outstanding with the ICB as our mortgage company didn’t bother selling it and it is now rotting away derelict.

“Deposit is at least €45000 which is a lot of money to generate when paying high rent. There is nothing in place for people in our situation no support. We are desperate to own our own home.

“House prices are continually rising which doesn’t give us many options: a fixer upper out of the county away from our family needing more savings.

“It is soul destroying we are getting older and need security of our own home.”

‘Our landlord won’t register us with the PRTB’

“I’m late twenties and renting in Dublin for the last five-ish years. Living with parents isn’t an option for me. I am in my current place about two years currently I pay €650 pm rent which I’m aware is a great rate for Dublin.

“Our landlord isn’t in touch much which is great but we are concerned that he refuses to give us tenancy agreements or register us with the PRTB. If we don’t like it we can leave etc.

“He told us he’s got a mortgage on the house which is ‘crippling him’ and that’s why he’s ‘had to’ put rent up in 2020. He has also turned the downstairs living room into a bedroom so there’s four of us here total making him over €2k pm (higher than any of our salaries).

“We have had a few issues that he hasn’t fixed but we feel very powerless to leave because of the dire situations others are in. It’s also difficult because without PRTB registration or any formal tenancy agreement we feel like if we’re too demanding we could all just be evicted at a moment’s notice so we’re very cautious about hassling him to fix things.

“However we’re lucky – it’s a good location and rent (though astronomical by European standards) is VERY reasonable compared to some others! And this year we got a carbon monoxide alarm so things are looking up!”

Chris: ‘We save €600 a month but can’t afford a house’

“I am 25 years old and currently I live at home with my parents. Myself and my girlfriend are currently saving for a home. We are putting €600 each aside each month to save for a deposit. Both of us are civil servants.

“Even though we have government jobs saving at the moment seems redundant as with are combined wage we won’t be able to afford anything other than a one bedroom apartment. It’s heartbreaking to know that we will never be able to afford a house in the area I or where my girlfriend grew up in Dublin.

“I know it’s a first world problem but working for the government shouldn’t mean you have to live in exile of your family if you want anything more than a one bed.”

‘My fiancé and I live separately with our parents so we can save’

“I’m 29 my fiancé is 30 and we’re both living with our parents separately in our respective family homes. We have never actually lived together. We’ve been saving sporadically since 2016 for a house however being young we also wanted to travel and twice blew considerable amounts of our savings on trips of a lifetime.

“We also made the decision to get married before buying a house because of the deposit we’d need was significantly more than the cost of a wedding. Based on our income we’re outside the threshold for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme but also priced out of new build houses and therefore the First Time Buyers Grant based on the mortgage value and repayments we can achieve.

“So we’re stuck with coming up with a large deposit for a second hand home. As we both work in different parts of Dublin and neither of us drive location and transport links are important.

“Second hand homes are mostly cheaper than new builds but require a higher deposit and usually within our price range also require work done to make them comfortably habitable before moving in.

“We’re hoping to have at least €30k saved by this time next year and that’s doable only because we’re lucky not to be paying rent. Unfortunately the reality is we’ll need about €50k before we can actually by somewhere pay all the fees do repairs and furnish it.”

‘We had marriage planned – now we have to live separately with our parents’

“I’m 33 my partner is 27. I’m a civil servant and my partner is semi-State. Our combined income is just shy of 50k. We’re in the midlands. The last place we rented was €1500 a month. It was impossible to put a penny away for a mortgage.

“Her parents had small piece of land we went through the rigmarole of applying for planning permission for a cabin and were told that it didn’t suit the style of architecture in the area. This was in the middle of the rural countryside with maybe 3-4 houses in a mile not on the same road.

“Both our parents have severe medical issues so we never had anything in the way of the ‘Bank of Mam and Dad’. We’ve been together five years had marriage planned. Now we’re both living in our respective parents homes seeing each other maybe twice a week due to schedules and trying to penny pinch a deposit in between unforeseen things cropping up.”

‘Dealing with REIT caused us a lot of trauma’

“I am currently renting under one of the large institutional landlords. Due to COVID-19 one of our housemates decided not to renew at the end of the tenancy. We were right at the height of Level 5 restrictions at the time could not even show anyone the room. “We asked for some kind of arrangement on the rent for a temporary period while we tried to find a new housemate. We eventually found someone but we were not able to get the landlord to agree to even a temporary rent reduction. They offered a deferred payment scheme or suggested we could eat into our deposit. “Their shareholder primacy essentially meant that we as tenants had to shoulder all of the fallout from the worst health crisis in a century. With nowhere else to go we had to find an extra €1300 in rent just so our landlord could remain at the top of the Irish stock exchange. That they are the biggest landlord in the state should terrify everyone. There is no human aspect to a REIT that has a responsibility shareholders and dealing with them caused us a lot of trauma.” Keith: ‘We are in limbo’ “My partner and I are in our forties and we rent a house in County Limerick for €1200 a month. We earn the guts of €80000 between us but by the time bills are paid etc it’s hard to make any meaningful savings. I work in hospitality so was out of work for a lot of the last 14 months so most of our savings are eroded. “I was a first-time buyer in 2004 with my previous partner but signed the house over to her when we separated. So I am not entitled to FTB Support despite not owning a house and will need to come up with a 20% deposit before we even think of buying a house. Realistically that is €40000. It’s an impossibility. We don’t qualify for council housing which we’d gladly accept; we are in limbo. We’ve spent the last 10 years paying rent (€105000) and will spend the next 20 years paying rent but what do we do when we retire and can’t afford rent? “It all seems a bit hopeless over the last few days as I’ve listened to government politicians and their lack of understanding of the scale of what they’ve created and all I can think is maybe it’s time to leave. I didn’t emigrate in the 90’s or the 00s but now I feel a bit beaten and maybe it’s time to go.” Mark: ‘We moved out of Dublin and it changed our lives’ “My wife and I moved into a rented two-bed apartment in D18 in 2012. However with the ever-increasing costs of living in Dublin which wasn’t commensurate with any pay rises we were getting we decided we had to get out of Dublin. “We felt whilst we were living in Dublin we weren’t truly experiencing it – we didn’t have the money to go out our lives were spent on the M50 etc. When we first moved into that apartment it was €1000 a month but with each passing year it went up by €100 a month. By 2016 when we moved out we had been paying €1400 a month. “We moved to just outside Killarney initially we rented a 3-bed farmhouse for €400 a month a €1000 a month saving for ~3 times the amount of living space! We rented there for 20 months and were able to save up €35k because of it. “We bought a four-bed bungalow a 5 minute drive from town for €220k. We spent €65k on a full renovation and now have a B2 house. “We were able to move as my wife got a job transfer and I was able to work remotely. I truly believe COVID will mean a lot more people will move to rural areas to get a better quality of life cheaper housing costs and potentially closer to home. I know of 3 other colleagues who have sold their apartments in Dublin to move to rural locations closer to their families.” ‘Issues with probate due to Covid-19 are holding up our purchase’

“Both myself and my fiancée have been house hunting for over 18 months and to no avail. We previously went sale agreed on a property but this sale fell through due to the undue delay with issuing a grant of probate for the house. The house had been left in a will. “Due to Covid-19 there is a massive delay in selling houses that are subject to probate. A house cannot be sold until a grant of probate is issued. “We were sale agreed for three months while waiting on probate. We were told that we would have to wait it out and if we were to do so it would have afforded the seller an opportunity to keep an eye on the market and possibly put the property back on the market if it improved in their favour. We felt as if we were being used as a fall back! “Also we went sale agreed on the house at a price that was well in excess of the asking price. This problem could have been easily rectified if the Probate Office facilitated these applications by way of a Zoom call and any paperwork that needed to be signed could have been witnessed by a solicitor etc. “We are both employed in good secure jobs and we cannot purchase a standard semi-detached house in North Dublin. We are not looking for anything extravagant just something that is value for money in an average area. This does not exist in Ireland.” ‘The bank sold my loan to a vulture fund’ “I am a property investor. The bank sold my loan to a vulture fund. No arrears existed.

The vulture fund sought full payment within seven days of my loan. I could not remortgage or sell the property in seven days so the vulture fund appointed a receiver. “I offered to buy my house back from the receiver but he would not accept my price but oddly sold the house for less money than I’d offered! The vulture fund is suing me now in court for the shortfall.”

Michael: ‘It is almost impossible to find somewhere to rent while being on the PUP’

“I have been trying to rent an apartment for the last four months without having any success. I’m a 23-year-old graduate.

“Everyday for the last four months I have been searching online for somewhere to rent for returning to work. Time and time again I have been told no by both landlords and property agents. It is almost impossible to find somewhere to rent while being on the PUP. I have been told several times to get back to them once you are off the PUP.

“However I can’t get off the PUP and return to my workplace if I don’t have somewhere to rent/live. It is a stressful and mentally draining process applying to various properties to not even hear back from many of them. I have never had this much savings in my bank account before yet it is extremely difficult to find a place to rent in the Dublin area.

“I’ve had to move home to my parents house in the country and if the last four months is anything to go by it doesn’t give me the greatest of confidence that I will be successful in renting an apartment/property from a landlord or property agent.

“My hope is that for younger people and for future generations to come it will not be this difficult and stressful when looking to rent a property.”

‘We earn too much for housing assistance and not enough for a mortgage’

“We rented for 12 years and two years ago our landlord needed the house back for family reasons. Rents were much higher than we could afford so myself partner and our children moved in to my partner’s parents’ three-bed house to save a deposit.

“And it’s been one disaster after another we can’t get a mortgage big enough from the banks so we applied for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan with south Dublin county council and after a seven-month wait they refused us.

We were devastated I reached out to Citizens Advice and the council for what I could do next and was told that we fall in-between the cracks because we earn too much for any sort of housing assistance (council house/HAP) but we don’t earn enough to get a mortgage big enough to afford a house in our area.

“We’re really at a loss we can’t afford the extortionate rents and we can’t stay with family forever.”

”I’ve been on the council housing list since 2017′

“I am a Black man that is 22 years old with a disability living my parent and three siblings in a three-bedroom house in Co Kerry.

“I would like to live in a rented apartment for the first time on my own or with different people in blockchain apartment if that could happen at some point of my life. I will be working very soon but only part-time in a job because I need the disability medical cards.

“But I am still in college and I will be finished when I get a job and a apartment to live in. I have been on the the county council housing list from 2017 and I am still waiting for a place to live now.”

‘With a lot of effort and sacrifice you can get where you want to be’

“In 2012 we moved in together. With our combined savings and a small mortgage we bought the worst house we could this was close to bottom of the market so was in hindsight a great price and I set about renovating.

“The renovations took about seven months in total and it was perfect for us until we were lucky enough to be joined by our first child. We quickly ran out of room and looked for a bigger house.

“With a second child after arriving we purchased another house again in need of total renovation. This was bought with a new mortgage and we tried to cashflow the renovations as much as possible I had the heavy tools out again to save as much money as possible. I did as much as I could myself for the next six months.

“It was hard work again but worth it. After 8 years of living in the city and with two young kids we were sick of the students and noise. So we began another search again back to the bank (nightmare) to try and see what we could borrow so we could have our budget in place.

“After this sale we moved in with family and got lucky with a great house in a great

location (for us) but again needed complete renovation. This was funded with the proceeds of two prior houses plus a third mortgage (the bank got their math wrong on two separate occasions – always check). We got an engineer and builder on board and moved in in late 2020.

“So an eight-year story of house moves and climbing the property ladder but I think it shows that with a bit (lot) of effort and sacrifice you can get to where you want to be… but having a plan and budget are very important.”

‘My partner was told about an inheritance left to him for a family home – we both sobbed’

“I met my partner in 2016. I was renting a room in a house share in Dublin and he was living at home in a commuter town. I became pregnant in 2018. We were worried long term because if we were renting how would we ever save a deposit to buy? The only option would have been moving in with family with a child. I know so many who’ve done that but it doesn’t make it right.

“My partner was told about an inheritance that was left to him for the purpose of buying a family home. When I say that we both sobbed is an understatement. To know there was a way of providing a secure home for our child was just overwhelming. However my partner had to lose someone extremely close to him for us to be in that situation. That’s not right either.

“We signed contracts on a new build house in February 2020 just before Covid. There were obviously delays but we got the keys to our house in December 2020. The prices of the houses in our estate now are already out of our reach in terms of mortgage approval. We are blessed we got our house when we did. Mullen Park in Maynooth is not far from us. The houses that did go to the market we were priced out of anyway.”

‘At 36 I’m lucky to be almost mortgage-free’

“I have a good housing story which is probably in the minority at the moment and I know how lucky I am and am so grateful.

“I bought my apartment in 2017 it’s just me on my own I could only afford a one-bed. I moved from the town where I grew up and all my friends are to the northside as unless I was to win the Lotto I would never be able to afford to live there.

“I gave up smoking just over a year ago and so sent in a declaration to my mortgage protection to reduce the premium. I’d had some health issues which I also had to declare and they replied saying there could be a claim on the serious illness cover. I found out this week that they are admitting the claim and so at 36 years of age I am about to be mortgage free.

“If there’s any advice I’d give to anyone now it is include serious illness on your mortgage protection! I feel like I’ve won the Lotto it’s a dream come true!”

‘Getting a place for myself is out of reach’

“I’ve been renting in Dublin since summer 2010 and living in the same apartment throughout this time. The apartment was newly built in a great location. I’ve held the lease and I’ve utilised the house share adverts through the years to rent a room.

“The rent was stable until around 2014/15 but since then the cost has increased by 4% each year. It is relatively on or below average in cost for the size and location and thus it’s difficult getting the property management to paint or fix any major issues. I feel they would rather prefer we moved out so they could carry out these jobs which would mean they can substantially increase the rental rate.

“Getting a place to myself is out of reach financially either renting or buying. While the lure of West and its lower cost of living is enticing I don’t feel ready to leave the city life I enjoy so much.”

‘We lost our jobs in the crash’

“I’m 45 married with children. Had a deposit for a house in 2008 and were looking to buy. Then myself and my wife both lost our jobs in the crash. I went self-employed working where I could and our deposit gradually got spent on rent and food.

“Since then we have had children and I’ve retrained to Masters level at own expense while working full time. Since graduating I’ve been fortunate to work self employed making about 50K p/annum and until Covid hit my wife who had returned to work had been working part time. We have been renting in rural Ireland at a reasonable cost and have been saving really hard for a deposit for a house.

“The lending institutions that we have approached won’t offer us more than 70K because of our age self employed status and our children. I see prices going up and the prospect of ever owning a home receding. The insecurity of work and the housing situation has taken an enormous toll on our mental health and both myself and my wife suffer from depression and severe anxiety.

“I fear for the future. I’m one phone call away from being given notice to leave and one short term contract away from being unemployed and spending our savings on the basics again. I feel utter despair when I see the government priorities and policies on housing. I remember what it was like being happy and not being worried sick every day. When you don’t have a secure home nothing else really matters.”

‘What was in my reach two years ago is no longer achievable’

“I am a working lone parent living at my parents in order to save for a small cheap house. But in Co Galway these do not exist anymore. What might have been within my reach two years ago is no longer achievable.

“I do not qualify for a mortgage as apparently I would not have enough disposable income left over at the end of the month after paying my mortgage. On that note who are ‘they’ to tell me how much I should have to spend at the end of the month? I am an expert at budgeting paying all bills on time and living well within my means.

“So I am literally saving the full amount for a house. It’s going to take me 10 years but this is the only way forward I can see. Unfortunately the more I save (of my already taxed income) the more my lone parent benefit will be deducted.”

Sean: ‘The house is damp’

“I’m a single man in his thirties with no children. I’m renting with my friend and we both pay €800pm for a two bedroom house in D12.

“The house is damp we have single glazed windows which won’t close we aren’t allowed to take out the prepay gas meter so electricity and gas are approx 250 per month depending on weather.

“I’m a nurse I work 40 hours per week plus overtime to survive. Last year due to the pandemic I earned €55000. This isn’t enough for a mortgage but too much to apply for housing schemes. I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. My options are to work as much as I can or to try earn less than €50000… ”

‘We owed over €300k’

“In 2006 I was looking to rent with my now wife a one-bed in D6 was about €1.4k. We worked out it would be cheaper to buy even if we ended up spending nearly €400k. We got outbid three times (a two-bed in Rathmines went for €415k) but we eventually got a one-bed in D6 in early 2007 for €381k.

“Then the crash happened. At one stage our apartment was worth €140k. We owed over €300k. I got transferred to another city in 2010 and have been renting the apartment out ever since. Our rent has never come close to covering the mortgage. I have paid C&I every month for over 14 years and am still in negative equity. I’d have sold years ago but I’m not paying off an unsecured loan on a property I’d no longer own.

“With two salaries coming in we just managed to buy a house at the bottom of the market in late 2013 (€160k). I lied about what the Dublin flat was worth.

“Loads of people would love to own a flat in the location it is and I’d love to sell.”

‘I’m 40 single and working out of my childhood bedroom’

“I am 40 single and currently working my full-time office job out of my childhood bedroom. I make what is listed as the median income for an Irish person and by staying with my parents I have saved double the minimum deposit. But I can’t buy a home.

“Because of a medical condition I can’t drive so I am limited in where I can house hunt. There is simply nothing affordable for a single person that is near public transport. I keep wondering if I should give up looking and rent instead.

“But then how will I manage when I can’t work anymore with no savings and no secure home? So I stay in my old bedroom and watch the house prices increase faster than I can save.”

‘I live with my controlling ex’

“I’m a woman in her 40s. One child. Separated but still living with controlling abusive ex in rented house. Cannot afford rent. Work full time. Am on housing list. Can’t find anywhere with rent supplement.

“Don’t want to declare myself homeless. What would that do to my son’s mental health? Only family here in Ireland is my elderly parents – no space in their house. Ex won’t move. I couldn’t afford rent here without him either. Have safety order against him but that’s it. I’ll never own. Can’t even rent a one bedroom place.

“Moving from Dublin is only option but till my son leaves school not able to. My work is here too.”

‘It feels like the government is against us’

“We have been saving hard for two years for a large deposit… skipping holidays and cutting anywhere we can. We are well over the 10% deposit required at this stage so any extra we are adding to our purchase price.

“We are on decent wages (circa €110k per annum between us) but still had to get an exemption of 4.5 times our salary. We are hoping to buy in South Dublin because that’s where my parents live but despite all our saving and our exemption we are priced out of the rare house that arises in the area.

“Pre-Covid houses were few and far between and now we are in a full drought supply wise. We have been outbid several times at our absolute max of 540k. We are in our 30s and hoping to start a family but that’s being pushed back further and further due to the housing situation.

“It sometimes really gets you down especially when it feels like the government is working against you and wants to price you out. It doesn’t seem appealing to commute for hours and miles from family as they age but its been something we have been forced to consider.

“We also pay €1.3k rent a month on top of our savings which could be better spent in a pension to ensure that we have a decent future ahead of us. It feels like the government are working against us at every turn.”

Daniel: ‘Homeowning shouldn’t be only for high-earning couples’

“I’ve worked full-time in reasonably well-paid positions since I left college. I’ve always aimed to buy my own house as early as possible so I’ve been saving to some extent every payday.

“After eight years of working full time I’ve changing jobs three times and had a few promotions. I now earn a good salary by most definitions (roughly €70k total last year) I save about €1000 per month and I have over €50k saved.

“But I’m struggling to accept the fact that I’ll likely never be a homeowner in Ireland. I don’t want to buy a house with my partner (he already owns a house) nor should I have to. Homeownership shouldn’t be reserved for high-earning couples who want to live together.”

‘We rent a studio apartment for €1200 a month’

“My housing story is probably similar to a lot of people. My boyfriend and I rented a €1200 studio in Dublin (the cheapest we could find) and were stuck in it for the first five months of the pandemic elbow to elbow working at home.

“Now we live in a converted garage. Landlords are lovely but we can’t save for a house with that kind of rent so we’ll have to move back in with the parents for a while.

“Lockdown helped us save a lot but loads of houses are out of our price range because we don’t earn enough so we need a huge deposit for a semi-decent house. No idea when we’ll finally have a place of our own. The news about those homes in Maynooth being bought by a cuckoo fund has us really worried now.”

Diogo: ‘This is a risky situation’

“I have arrived in Ireland in 2015 for my first job in tech. I have been sharing a flat ever since including after marriage two years ago.

“My wife and I have been saving well but the house prices mean that we would be stuck with a loan for the rest of our working life.

This is a risky situation especially for two foreigners.

Lynn: ‘We’re getting too old for a mortgage – in our forties’

“We’re at the older end of generation rent. Both in our early forties both working full time earning €30000 or so each. So for starters €450000 is NOT affordable.

“We’re in private rental accommodation in a rent pressure zone with a landlady who attempted to issue an eviction notice during lockdown one which was strongly rebuffed and we’ve not heard a word from her since but left feeling insecure.

“We’d love to have bought we had mortgage approval and a deposit on a site to self build in 2007. All fell through in ’08. Hence we’re still renting.

“I’d like security of tenure and a fair rent. And the hope of owning our own place. We’re now getting a bit old to even get a mortgage…”

Ciara: ‘I’m on the council waiting list for 11 years’

“I am in my fifties single no kids and live in Co Kerry. I live in a two-bedroom flat on my own. I love living on my own and the apartment is nice. My rent is about €700 per month and because I am not working social welfare pay €130 of my €163 rent per week.

“I have mental health issues so receive disability living allowance – this is roughly €225 per week so I have €200 or so per week for living and my bills etc. I am very good with my money and owe nobody any money. I have lived for 10 years in my apartment. I privately rent it and am on the council waiting list for about 11 years.

“Hopefully I will get an affordable house or flat from Kerry County Council but I could be waiting another few years. I could never afford a mortgage.”

‘I look like I’m living the dream – but I sleep on a sofa bed’

“I live in an affluent Dublin suburb. I’m 28 living in an apartment and completing my second university degree. I don’t have to pay rent. Seems like I’m living the dream right?

“Except I don’t have a bedroom; I have a sofa-bed. And it’s not my apartment it’s my relatives’. It’s been three years since the end of an abusive relationship left me homeless and my family put me up. I never expected to be here this long but I have a safe place to stay. I’m so grateful.

“I’m on Disability Allowance and my SUSI grant helps pay for some private healthcare (still on waiting-lists publicly). This area’s HAP threshold is lower than most rents. And other people need accommodation more urgently. I feel selfish wanting more – wanting my own bedroom door. So I’m grateful.

“I have overcome significant obstacles over the past few years – I am so proud of myself. But while recovering from trauma and learning how to manage my disability I missed my chance to ‘start a career’ and ‘get-on-the-property-ladder’. I’ll never own my own home. I can’t even afford to dream. And it feels like that’s my own fault.”

Stephanie: ‘Estate agents told us the property price would go up 8%’

“Myself and my husband are first-time buyers. We have been outbid on six properties since we got our approval in late January one house was up for 395k and went sale agreed without any viewings at €465k in north Dublin.

“We have had ‘virtual tours’ of properties which is basically just the estate agent showing you a YouTube video taken on an iPhone but they’re an improvement from some estate agents who don’t even get back to us.

“We had cocky estate agents tell us ‘yes expect this property price will be bidded up by at least 8%’. Now we’re finding many of the houses we bid on early in the year are back on the market as the sales have fallen through. But get this the estate agents have rang us to say the owners won’t go less than the price the property went sale agreed at! Which in one case was over 30k above the asking price.

“We have family telling us to ‘wait it out’ and that ‘the bubble will burst soon’ but as a couple who want to start a family and are in the best financial position we will probably ever be in it’s hard to sit tight for two-three years for a possible market crash. Don’t forget our Dublin rent as well which is running money down for us each month.

“Add to all this the revelation this week that investment funds are buying up estates just makes us feel like giving up. It doesn’t look like supply will meet demand for a long time and unfortunately it looks like we’ll be the ones caught in the firing line.”

‘I pay rent to live in my parents’ attic’

“I’m 31 and returned to my parents’ house in my early twenties after a couple of years working abroad. What was originally supposed to be a short-term arrangement now feels like my permanent situation.

“I contribute what would qualify as a fair ‘rent’ for the attic room buy my own shopping and obviously do my own washing etc. I can’t afford to rent on my own and while I could possibly rent a room in a house share for the the same amount I give my parents I don’t see the point in sharing a rented house with strangers and always having the fear of losing the property and being unable to afford anything else on my budget.

“Living at home is not ideal but I feel extremely lucky to have a strong safety net here. I am saving every month but it can feel pointless; as a single person it is very unlikely that I will qualify for mortgage which will buy anything in Dublin.”

‘My house is in negative equity’

“I’m 50 and separated eight years. I’ve spent over €50k on rent in last 8 years. Home house is in negative equality. Would love if council brought out a scheme like a rent to buy scheme.

“I would pay €600-700 a month to the council for rent to buy and maintain the house myself with repairs etc and maybe someday in 15-20 years when the council have got back what it cost them to build I would own the house.

“All I am doing at the moment is paying dead money to a landlord who owns tens of properties making them richer.”

‘It’s not an equal society if single people are punished economically’

“I am a teacher in a secondary school. I believe in houses for working people as that is what I am. I would not like to see housing needs and various sectors played off one another.

“I live and work in Dublin Bay South and originally I am from the West of Ireland.

I am renting long-term and afraid I won’t be able to buy a house. I am a first-time buyer who’s being priced out of my desired area.

“It is not an equal society if single people are punished economically with long-term implications affecting them later in life. Being priced out of home ownership due to decades of poor planning and the subsequent gaslighting by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael government is criminal. They are blaming each other and there seems to be no accountability from any of them.

“Single people with professional well-paid careers should not be relegated socially or economically or denied home ownership due to their relationship status. A person should not have to be economically pressured to partner up. Single people are workers too and pay taxes.

I think it really affects your sense of self worth self esteem and whole personal life when you cannot have autonomy about your quality of life which is connected to feeling safe and living well.

“It is not acceptable to expect parents and the bank of mom and dad to pay deposits; this is an approach that exacerbates and highlights economic inequality.

“I have seen on dating profiles ‘anyone want to go 50/50 on a mortgage’ – although they may be joking it’s pretty bleak disturbing and dystopian to think that perhaps that is how people are beginning to think and that is no way to live life.

Kieran: ‘There are no new builds in my price range’

“I’m a 30-year-old man with a child. I have lived with my parents all my life in D22. I’ve a good job and have saved a decent house deposit. Last year I was approved for the Help to Buy scheme. I was approved for a mortgage in principle in January.

“Between mortgage approval and savings my budget is around €260k. When I was approved this looked like plenty to buy in this area. However nearly everything has gone way over my budget by the time I phone the estate agent. There are no new builds in my price range around Dublin.

“A house I saw around the time of my mortgage approval was up for €250k it sold for €317k per property price register. Houses for sale are being removed off Daft before going back up 2 weeks later for an extra €25k.

“All I want is the same opportunity to purchase a property for my family that my parents had in their 20s preferably before I get to my 40s.”

‘Working from home could let me buy a house in the country’

“I’m now 34 and was saving as much as possible prior to the pandemic however that wasn’t a lot. I was on a wage of approx €50k but with Dublin city centre rent of €800 for a box room and living expenses saving rates were low.

“It looked like a tiny house somewhere in the Dublin suburbs would be at least five years away. Maybe a bit quicker if I met a partner with a similar goal (lol at affording a house being dependent on finding love).

“The pandemic ended up changing my circumstances significantly. Firstly my boss left and I ended up taking their role getting a raise to €70k after a probation period. Secondly I ended up stuck in my folks’ home in the countryside for the first lockdown.

“Turned out I liked the countryside and maybe with work culture changes working from home could allow me to buy in the countryside instead of Dublin.”

‘Securing a traditional mortgage would be difficult for me’

“I currently live in Co Limerick with my mother in the family home. I moved back there in March 2020 due to Covid and having to work from home. Previously I had been renting in Dublin.

“My studio flat in Dublin was not suitable for working in. I had been renting in Dublin since 2006 in various parts of the city. I suppose I haven’t given much thought to my housing situation til recently; I’m quite laidback. I earn €43000 a year so securing a traditional mortgage would be a struggle for me with a modest single income in my early 40s.

“I would be interested in affordable housing initiatives. Alternatively something like ‘cost rental’ may be suitable for me but my overall concern about long-term rental would be: what happens when I reach retirement? Would I still have to pay the same level of rent in retirement? Would I earn equity in the property over time?”

‘I’m a single parent and need security for my daughter’

“I am a single parent. I pay €700 a month rent. I share 50/50 custody with my daughter’s dad. I am a manager at a finance company and can’t find any mortgage that would give me enough to buy anywhere where I live.

“I’m not looking for much: a two-bed house or apartment with a garden. Quoted €121000 by my bank as a mortgage and it’s ridiculous.

“I have afforded my rent for years and have saved money for a deposit on top but with the 3.5 times bank rule it’s seems like there is no hope of ever owning my own home and having security for my daughter in the future.”

Patricia: ‘My housing story has a happy ending’

“My housing story ends with a happy ending we have been living in our home two years it’s not all doom and gloom. Myself and my partner decided in 2017 we’d start saving for a house. We saved and saved.

“In 2018 we started looking at second hand homes and even found a few we liked. We were out-bid a few times. We didn’t have enough money to go above asking as we were funding ourselves and we wanted to do it ourselves. We were both working on a salary of 70k between us so we’re not millionaires and we were saving double of what our mortgage would be.

“We were pretty tired of the second hand market and decided to go new build with the help to buy scheme. By luck we signed up for a new housing development and we got our new build house and got our help to buy. We have been happily in the house for two years soon.

“We were very lucky and it’s extremely hard out there but there is light at the end of the tunnel. However even with not paying rent and a gift from my parents buying a house down here still seems impossible. Anything near to my folks would require an exemption on the mortgage and leave me with not a penny for stamp duty or buying furniture. And that’s if everything half decent wasn’t snapped up in days for well over the asking price.”

‘We’re in our 50s and don’t have our own place’

“I’m living with my husband and my son for the last 13 years in Dublin in rented

accommodation. In 2008 we paid for a one-bedroom apartment of €1300 per month. My husband and I worked but we could never save for a deposit as our salary was too little.

“Then in 2012 we lost our jobs. We went back to the college. We were on the Back to Education Programme. It was a tough time and of course with little money still living in rented accommodation.

“As two new graduates we still got paid less than others with degree qualifications in other fields. Still not saving money for a deposit as our son was in secondary school. Still living in the same rented accommodation living with the fear because of the high rent prices on the market.

“In 2020 my husband lost his job he was unemployed for four months. I was the only one who worked paid rent bills as my son was jobless as well in March because of Covid.

“Finally he got a job in October 2020 but he got less paid than his previous job. It was unacceptable to live in a one-bedroom apartment three adults; at the end of January

2021 when the prices for two-bedroom apartments were less we moved into a two-bedroom apartment. We pay €2000 per month. I’m doing my Masters. I have to invest four more years in myself to earn a decent salary to buy something.

“For people like us who are struggling and earn just €2000 per month it is impossible to buy a house and there is no help out there from the Government for us. We are in our 50s so I don’t know when we will have our place.’

‘I’ve been paying rent for a heartbreaking 18 years’

“I am late 30s single been fully employed since college. I earn marginally over €50k per annum so don’t qualify for any schemes bar HTB. Have deposit saved. Would only get top mortgage of approx €225.

“Work in Dublin city centre. Been paying rent for a heartbreaking 18 years. Really want to buy my own first home now. Just one home for me to live in. Moved back to family home in 2020 hoping to save more for purchase. No chance of getting anything in my area that I know/am familiar with.

“Why can’t Help to Buy (ie tax rebate on the tax I have paid) not be extended to second hand houses for FTB?!?”

Hayley: ‘It’s impossible to buy at the moment’

“I’m currently looking to buy a home with my partner. We are both fortunate enough to be living with our parents in a city. We have both rented in house shares when we first started going out but ended up having to move home as rent prices were climbing.

“We were looking for a place to rent just the two of us for a while but we decided it was mad to pay a landlord’s mortgage when we could start saving for our own.

“We are mortgage approved and eager to find a home. We have found that between Covid-19 and the housing crisis it is almost impossible to buy at the moment.”

‘I spent seven months with no toilet’

“I had always lived in my own property however as a result of domestic violence I moved to Co Limerick. I ended up in HAP accommodation moving three times in five years.

“The place I’m in now my landlord/developer has been trying to evict two of us because we could not pay his cash top up demands and I helped other tenants with my basic knowledge of law.

“I have been left with no heating for two years and in A&E in November 2019 with suspected monoxide poisoning. I spent seven months of the pandemic with no functioning toilet and sewage pouring onto the pavement resulting in me calling the Samaritans over the Christmas period something I never did even during my abuse.

“I have even thought recently should I have stayed in my abusive relationship because this is as traumatic only at least back there I had a home. I have been to everyone for assistance. I’m in and out of RTB cases fighting to keep a roof over my head. I have a list from TDs to head of RTB and Revenue I have contacted with evidence.

No one wants to know. Maybe when someone dies down here there will be accountability. But at what cost then.

‘I will never afford a home of my own – shared living has taken a toll’

I’m 25 single and have been renting in Dublin since my third year of college. I finished college three years ago and have been working full time for the past three years and earn €55000 a year.

“This new scheme means I will never be able to buy a house in Dublin based on my current salary as a single person. Shared living has taken its toll during the pandemic with all four housemates working from home with our lease due to expire later this year.

“I have to pay rent but am also expected to be saving for a deposit of what €30 €40k? I will be in my 40s before I am anywhere near to having that much saved. We need help out there!”

‘I was told by banks I don’t earn enough’

“I left my job as my €32k salary was never going to help me in obtaining a mortgage in Dublin. I was told by banks I don’t earn enough. It was humiliating.

“So I moved county to the countryside and now I can rent an apartment to myself at a price that’s not low or high but at 35 I need my own place. I spent years saving for a deposit for a house I was never going to afford in Dublin. I’ll never have my own property. It has been detrimental to my life not being able to afford to rent or buy in my hometown.

“It’s hopeless for a normal young person with no leg up on the mortgage ladder.”

‘I lost my late 20s to a disability’

“I lost my late 20s due to a disability. I lived with my parents but it wasn’t suitable for my needs. I lived in a box room until I got a bedsit from the council which helped me regain my independence do physio and get back to work. I still have bad days but I’m able to work through the pain. I’m not earning nearly as much as my peers due to being out of the workforce for so long.

“I’ve now met someone but we can’t afford to live together as we’d need a two-bedroom place so when my pain levels are bad I can sleep alone and living separately is cheaper than renting a two-bed. We can’t find anything for less than €2k a month.

“A mortgage would be cheaper but my partner is on reduced hours due to Covid and we can’t afford to save. My partner is terrified of the landlady due to previous landlords ending tenancies so they can ‘redecorate’ only to see the property advertised at much higher prices looking the same a month later. I’m afraid we’ll never get a place of our own at this rate.”

‘It’s ripping me of my self-identity’

“I live with my mum and it has not been easy. My mum and I have not been having the best relationship. I emailed the council explaining to them the situation and they have refused to help – only if I find a HAP house that’s my only option. I ve looked and gone for viewings and not found anything.

“It’s ripping me of my self-identity as a woman and a mother because we need the space. I go into a depression and completely shut off at times because it’s so hard to explain because I felt unheard and ignored just like many others.

“My situation is not special but it’s painful how they have refused to give us our own home where me and my children can live in peace and be ourselves. I would love to start my own small business and be a bus driver at the same time but I feel this is truly stressing me out and holding me back.”

‘There is no support from the government or council’

“My housing story echoes the stories of so many of my friends and colleagues. We’re all still living at home saving as much as we possibly can and still locked out of the housing market.

“I’m currently living at home with my parents and siblings I’m stuck in a box room all day while I continue to work from home for the foreseeable future. I’ve saved enough to cover half of a deposit but my property options are non existent.

“As a single applicant there is no support from the government or the local council. I don’t make enough to buy a house apartments hardly ever come up within a 40 mile radius and the ones that do are still out of my price range I also don’t qualify for the housing list as I earn too much i.e 20c per hour above the living wage.

“The announcement of a house price capped at €300k in Wexford is laughable I don’t know a single person that could afford that on their own. Unless I make the decision to buy a derelict property and renovate it myself I don’t have any options but to continue to either live at home or move into a house share.

We seem to be stuck in an endless cycle of being told we earn too much for help and not enough to be a homeowner. I’ve already made the decision to emigrate next year my options to own a home abroad are far higher. The Tánaiste has said he doesn’t want to see another generation lost to emigration but it’s too late. We’re already gone.

‘I’m looking at emigrating but can’t leave my mum’

“As a hopeful first time buyer I’m single 40 with no kids and earn €85000 – €95000 per year as a freelancer in county Dublin. There’s no way I can afford a property with a garden anywhere near my elderly mum so I am looking at Wicklow but even then I will be at the top of my budget and there is no ‘Bank of Mum and Dad’.

“I pay €1200 per month in rent but I am moving into a relative’s home soon to live rent free for a few months to save more money. I have around €90k in savings – saved over 20 years – but even with that hefty deposit I could only afford a tiny apartment near my mum. Even with my deposit and high salary numerous banks have turned me down as I am self-employed.

“As a freelancer I also don’t want the risk of putting all of my savings into a deposit. Single working people are invisible in Irish society. Over the course of my life I will spend on average €1 million more than a person in a couple and I pay higher taxes – for what?

“Looking at emigrating for the second time but I can’t as that would leave my elderly Mum without a carer. Frustrated and disappointed but not surprised by the corruption in Irish politics.”

‘By 47 I was homeless and unemployed’

“I bought my first home when I was 28. By the time I was 47 I was homeless unemployed and unemployable. The bank demanded the house be sold which it did eventually leaving us with €70k of negative equity.

“We fell for the lifelong learning second chance myth and both my husband and I graduated with honours degrees followed by a Masters. Neither of us have ever been able to find work in our respective professions which we studied so hard for.

“After several years of renting in the private market we became RAS tenants in a privately owned property that we found ourselves. We are coming to the end of a five-year contract. Both of us have disabilities and we have no idea where we will be living next year. The council have no housing stock and we are not a priority as our housing needs are deemed to be met.

“I am 58 now and my husband is 64. The prospect of having to move house again and every few years is frightening. Between us we earn less than €40k a year and would never be able to buy a home again even if we earned more.

We are a forgotten generation our dreams are dead. Too old to start again and too young to die. We don’t speak of our fears anymore to each other and when my husband grows fearful of the future I try to comfort him with words of hope. Both of us knowing the truth but neither can bear to hear it uttered aloud.

‘I’m saving for a deposit in my thirties’

“I’m an early thirties software engineer saving my deposit as a first time buyer about 3/4s there. I’m renting an apartment in one of those investor owned developments for €2500 a month.

“I should have moved somewhere cheaper last year but I don’t want to face the substandard rentals with their mouldy-ridden rooms and wink-nudge illegal rent increases that will have you out on your arse for ‘renovations’ if you complain. It’s easier just to pay more and not have to deal with it.

“I’m saving about 1-2k a month and the mortgage calculators give me about 450k so I’m luckier than most of my generation there’s some end in sight. Ironic part is I don’t even want a house. I’d prefer a new apartment in the city but those are far above my budget.

“My parents are offering to help me with the deposit but I have siblings that need it more than I do. I feel guilty using their chance. Though in reality they’re probably going to have to wait for my parents to die before they’ll have enough. It just feels hopeless and if I feel like that – it’s hard to imagine how everyone feels.”

‘I was homeless – now I have my first house’

“Seven years ago my mam sister and I found ourselves in a situation where our landlord wanted to sell up. We ended up having to present to homeless services. We were put in a hotel with no fridge cooking or laundry facilities. My mam has a long-term disability and these all just worsened her condition.

“Fast forward to this year and at 30 I have just bought my first house. My partner and I have left all our family friends and familiarities of Dublin behind and bought a two-bed house in Wexford Town. We have both been working remotely since the pandemic so we felt it was the perfect time to leave Dublin.

In Dublin between us our rent was €1600 per month and we shared an apartment our mortgage is now €500 per month between us.

“I am lucky I was able to catch a break because so many others aren’t. The housing crisis in this country has created a poverty trap that is almost impossible to get out of and is causing generational poverty.”

‘My family and I have lived with my dad for two years’

“I’m so embarrassed writing our housing story but unfortunately I’ve become used to this feeling of shame and very happy to share it and hopefully help highlight the issue of housing/having a home in Ireland.

“My partner and I are in our thirties and have two children and currently we live with my Dad. I say currently but we’ve been here two years and I have no idea how we will leave.

“We were renting but our landlords moved home from abroad rents had increased considerably from when we started and so we moved home to try and save. We are on the lower scale of middle income earners living in Wicklow so rents and housing is off the charts.

“We save what we can we have no luxuries a 17-year-old car and yet we have nowhere near enough for a deposit. My son has been diagnosed with a disability and needs OT some behavioural psychology and speech and language… with three-year waiting lists we’ll have to go private which of course comes out of our savings.

“I feel constant shame at our situation how we can’t give our kids a home and yet we’ve worked solidly for years. We can’t invite friends over we can’t have a childminder for our home which is the best option for my son. And my Dad who worked his whole life now has a home filled with toys and mess.

“We earn just above the amount to get social housing supports and so we’re screwed. This country is only for those with inheritance or high income. This is not the life we planned for our family we are doing everything we can to provide a home for our children but the whole system is against us rental and ownership.”

‘I was refused the Rebuilding Ireland loan’

“Married single income. Gross income of €76k last two years and actual yearly salary of €57k. Renting a house with parents in Dublin paying €1k and so far have €26k deposit.

The market giveth and the market taketh away.

Growth stocks were the biggest winners of the pandemic rally last year but many of the hottest names that got tailwinds during the health crisis have faded with some popular growth stocks now down more than 50% from their previous peaks. Investors seem to believe that valuations have gotten stretched and many have rotated amid cyclical and value stocks banking on a strong recovery when the economy fully reopens. Earnings season has further reinforced this sentiment with many popular growth stocks diving in spite of impressive quarterly results.

However some high-quality companies have gotten thrown out with the bathwater making right now a great time for growth investors to go shopping. In particular Etsy (ETSY -0.32%) and Redfin (RDFN -1.88%) look ripe for new purchases.

Etsy takes a breather after an incredible year

Shares of Etsy (ETSY -0.32%) the online marketplace for handmade vintage and craft goods took a dive on Thursday in spite of another blowout earnings report. Etsy posted first-quarter 142% revenue growth to $550.7 million and even better earnings per share surged by a factor of 10 from $0.10 to $1.00 showing the leverage in its marketplace model. Both numbers beat analyst estimates but the stock fell 14.6% on second-quarter guidance. After posting four straight quarters of triple-digit growth Etsy is now lapping that performance and dealing with some headwinds from the reopening. As a result management sees revenue growth slowing to 15% to 25% in the second quarter.

While that mean seem concerning let's take a step back and consider all of the factors in the company's favor.

First e-commerce sales are going to decelerate as they lap the pandemic-driven surge of the last year but there's still fundamental long-term momentum that will drive online sales higher as delivery gets faster technology gets better and shoppers become even more accustomed to e-commerce. Etsy has seen a boom in new buyers and sellers on its platform a sign that brand awareness and engagement has surged as well. Active buyers on the platform nearly doubled to 90.7 million over the last year and active sellers rose by 67% to 4.7 million.

Finally the surge in profits shows the scalability of the company's marketplace model and profit margins should only get better over the long term. Down nearly 40% from its recent peak Etsy shares are starting to look like a bargain.

A real estate disruptor seizes an opportunity

Like Etsy Redfin has been a pandemic winner as the housing boom has led to strong growth for the digital real estate brokerage. Redfin posted 40% revenue growth in its first quarter to $268 million and gross profit more than tripled showing the business is gaining leverage. Its market share of U.S. existing home sales ticked up 21 basis points from a year ago to 1.14% showing it's steadily penetrating the residential real estate market but also that it still has a huge opportunity in front of it.

After initially furloughing agents during the early stages of the pandemic Redfin has ramped up hiring and is now ""hitting on all cylinders"" according to CEO Glenn Kelman. To further expand its market opportunity the company acquired RentPath a rental listings company in early April and Redfin is calling for 109% to 114% revenue growth to $446 million-$457 million in the current quarter as it laps the weak second quarter from a year ago. However investors punished the stock for forecasting a loss in the current quarter when analysts had expected a small profit. Part of the reason for that is the RentPath acquisition which will add a $9 million to $10 million net loss in the quarter but the bigger reason is that the company is investing in the growth of the business at an opportunistic moment. The company is ramping up marketing spending to take advantage of the spike in demand and its headcount has also surged.

Given Redfin's progress in gaining market share growing revenue and improving profitability in a massive market that spending seems like a worthwhile investment. Yet the market pushed the stock down 15.7% for forecasting a loss for the current quarter.

That seems like a mistake. The stock is now down nearly 50% from its recent highs despite a real estate boom and revenue that's expected to double in the current quarter and should remain strong for the duration of the year as its iBuying program reaccelerates. Now looks like a great opportunity to pick up shares of this real estate disruptor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvY2FycGVudGVyLWNyYWZ0cy1hLWJlYXV0aWZ1bC0yMDIxLWxhbmQtcm92ZXItZGVmZW5kZXItMTEwLXgtcmVwbGljYS0xNjA2NDkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carpenter Crafts a Beautiful 2021 Land Rover Defender 110 X Replica,"Car aficionados express their passion for cars in different ways. Some buy and collect them while others craft their own even if they’re made of wood.

The Woodworking Art channel on YouTube belongs to an insanely talented Vietnamese carpenter and among others showcases some of the most legendary car models ever made but portrayed as wooden replicas. The wooden vehicles are crafted with rare attention to detail using the finest more precious wood.One of the latest projects shared on the channel is a 2021 Land Rover Defender 110 X and it’s a thing of beauty.As its creator explains on his Etsy seller account the Land Rover took him about 32 days to complete which is not even that long given the incredible attention to detail. The Rover was carved piece by piece including the chassis doors windshield mirrors wheels (including the spare one!) and so on and then carefully put together in a perfect assembly.The wooden car is made of Fujian cypress wood a highly valued timber in Vietnam. This type of wood has a high density a characteristic aroma and is very resilient against termites which makes it a great choice for furniture and artifacts.The Defender replica has a weight of 3 kg (6.6 pounds) and the following dimensions: 353 L x 143 W x 129 H mm (13.8 X 5.6 X 5.07 in).The artist explains on his Facebook page that the 2021 Land Rover Defender 110 X fascinated him ever since he saw its video review and this replica was ordered by a friend of his. And if you want to order your own you can do so by visiting the artist’s Etsy page. The wooden car is priced at € 963 (approximately $1155).It is no wonder that the Defender 2021 stuck with the Vietnamese artist as the car was awarded the World Car Awards prize for best design . The Land Rover Defender was launched at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show and was very well received by both the automotive press as well as the public.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbGlmZWhhY2tlci5jb20vaG93LXRvLW1ha2UtbW9uZXktc2VsbGluZy1jdXR0aW5ncy1vZi15b3VyLWhvdXNlcGxhbnRzLTE4NDY4NDMwNDfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Make Money Selling Cuttings of Your Houseplants,"Credit: AngieYeoh - Shutterstock

The other day we talked about how a lot of the houseplants we buy in stores and greenhouses and online aren’t quite as environmentally friendly as we might have thought. This is because most of these plants are grown in peat which it turns out is a finite resource. (It does grow back but at a rate of 1 mm annually.)

Anyway one of the ways to make sure your houseplants aren’t contributing to the whole peat situation is by growing your own. Sure you could go the whole plant-a-seed route but growing plants from cuttings is faster and easier. And according to a study by investment researchers at money.co.uk you could also be sitting on a horticultural goldmine—or at least a mini side hustle.

Apparently growing new plants from cuttings of your existing plants can turn out to be pretty lucrative (and also hard work but that’s not the focus here). But some plants are a better investment than others. Here are the ones that are more likely to earn earn their keep.

How to determine the profitability of plants

To be clear the aim of the study was to determine which plants are the best investments (as you’d expect from a site with “money” in its name)—not necessarily which are the easiest to grow or are the lowest maintenance. This was a number-crunching situation.



Here’s how the team reached these figures:

Prices of fully grown houseplants and cuttings were collected by using scraped data from Facebook marketplace Farmer Gracy and Etsy. Once we collected the data we calculated the average price for both cuttings and fully grown plants for each variety of houseplant. We then calculated the percentage of change between the plant cutting and the fully grown plant to show the increase in investment for each houseplant.

How to pick the most profitable plants

Based on the money.co.uk team’s research Monstera Dubia plants are the best investment. According to their calculations cuttings from a Monstera Dubia will set you back between $20-30 while a grown potted plant goes for between $255-280: up to a +766% increase from your initial investment.

Before unveiling the chart that will make you rich we should point out that as you probably guessed from the website the plant purchasing and selling took place in the United Kingdom. Sure that’s something to keep in mind in terms of the plants’ availability but mostly we wanted to let you know that the prices listed will be in GBP not USD so you’ll need to do some math.

OK here you go:

And as with any other financial decision it’s a good idea to do your homework before jumping into something.



“Houseplant investments are a fun and alternative way to explore the investment world from the comfort of your own home” Salman Haqqi personal finance expert at money.co.uk said in a statement. “Like all investments with a bit of knowledge and research into the market these plant parents could be growing their home jungles into profitable investments in no time.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmllY2xhaXJlLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uL2EzNjM1NTMwNS9tb3RoZXItZGF1Z2h0ZXItYnJhbmRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Mother-Daughter Owned Fashion Brands to Get on Your Radar,"Mother-daughter relationships can be tough but wonderful (shoutout to my mom for dealing with me when I was a mean 13-year-old; still sorry about that). Of course every relationship dynamic is different but for many women our moms are who shape us into the people we become. They give the best advice and provide endless amounts of inspiration when it comes to life—and style. In the spirit of the holiday honoring moms and mother-figures everywhere this weekend we asked three of our favorite mother-daughter owned brands to give us the inside scoop on what it's like to have your parent (or your child) as your business partner. For the bad-ass duos (and a trio!) behind House of Aama Brinker & Eliza and Nudestix their unbreakable bonds combined talents and shared passion are the key to their success.

Rebecca Henry a lawyer by trade passed down her artistic abilities—sewing quilting—to her daughter Akua Shabaka who went on to attend Parsons School of Design. But it was while Shabaka was still in high school that the mother-daughter duo began their fashion journey. They started selling upcycled vintage pieces on Etsy as a hobby before experimenting with original designs. In 2015 House of Aama was born. The LA-based lifestyle brand is inspired by the pair's African heritage with a heavy focus on sustainability. Clearly the women are onto something: Last month Henry and Shabaka were chosen as one of 10 finalists for this year's CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund.

Marie Claire: What is it like to run a business with your mom/daughter?

Henry and Shabaka: A daily rollercoaster but at the end of the day we are family and dedicated to creating a heritage legacy brand so we make it work.

Marie Claire: Why is your mom/daughter the ideal business partner?

Henry and Shabaka: We already know each other’s strengths and weaknesses; so we can apportion the daily tasks in a way that makes sense. We aren’t trying to figure out what each one is capable of doing—we already know. Also because we are mother/daughter we are invested in building each other up and not tearing each other down.

Marie Claire: What is it like to run a business with your mom/daughter?

Eliza Higgins: Our skill-sets complement one another well. My mom is super creative and such a cool designer to work with. She’ll hear out an idea of mine then take it to a level that’s way beyond what I imagined in the first place. I meanwhile focus on the business side of things from marketing to merchandising to sales. Where we come together is in the creative vision. We’re inside one another’s heads that way. We’ll both have the same “craving” for a pair of striped shell earrings for example. Or one of us will suggest a design solution the other was just about to say. We both feel super lucky that this works and we’re so excited to see where this whole thing will lead.

Marie Claire: Why is your mom/daughter the ideal business partner?

Eliza Higgins: We understand one another and are able to appreciate the other’s point of view [and] individual sense of style. We’re also super aligned when it comes to the actual product. We’ll have the same idea about how to make something feel truly finished and what makes a piece of jewelry perfect. We also both have a “more is more” approach to designing—and wearing—jewelry.

Over the last seven years I’ve learned more from my mom—by absorbing everything she has to offer from a business and leadership perspective—than I could ever learn in a classroom or in any other setting. She has given both myself and my sister the platform to share our voice and to express creativity. Obviously working with family has it’s challenges; there is no “turning off” or typical 9-to-5 work day as most conversations revolve around work (which most entrepreneurs would know). However it is extremely rewarding being able to build a business with my mom—from traveling globally to ideating at the kitchen table these are moments I will always cherish and never take for granted.

Jenny Frankel: I absolutely love running a business with my daughters. Taylor and Ally are an inspiration: They are of a different generation; they inspire me to have modern thinking they inspire me to look at things in a new way that is multi-generational. They also inspire me to be a role model every single day. I love mentoring my daughters. I love showing them and sharing my experience with them which they are very open-minded to receive. I feel like that is my legacy. I am here to share with the girls what I’ve been able to learn as a beauty thought-leader and business leader over the years. It is a the best gift my daughters can give to me. Enjoying and learning and building this business together. And if they don't agree with me then I could always pull mom rank and say ""mom knows best.""

Marie Claire: Why is your mom/daughter the ideal business partner?

Taylor Frankel: Other than my mom being incredibly intelligent with a vast amount of beauty experience she is patient fair and an amazing leader. She sets a great example for my sister and me on what leadership means and how important it is to lead with both strength and empathy. My mom fills expertise that both my sister and I do not have so we make a great team.

Addressing the frontline workers in attendance Harry said: ""You spent the last year battling courageously and selflessly to protect us all and you served and sacrificed yourselves with bravery.

""The vaccine must be distributed to everyone everywhere we cannot rest or truly recover until there is fair distribution to every corner of the world. The virus does not respect borders access cannot be determined by geography. It must be a basic right for all.""

The combined company is valued at $2.2 billion and will have $700 million in cash on hand when the deal closes in the second half of 2021.



The Gores Metropoulos II Inc. transaction will include a private placement of $200 million from investors Fidelity Management & Research Co. as well as funds and accounts managed by BlackRock Inc. and Senator Investment Group.



The SPAC raised about raised $450 million through an initial public offering in January.



San Francisco-based Sonder which offers refurbished properties for short-term rentals works with real estate developers who build properties Sonder operates under its name.



“With its enormous market opportunity and experienced leadership team Sonder has already proven the resiliency and scalability of its business and has tremendous potential to continue expanding globally amid tailwinds created by the impending travel recovery” Gores said in a statement.



Gores chairman and chief executive of The Gores Group did his first SPAC in 2015. He has created 13 SPACs to date — more than anyone else on Wall Street — and closed eight of the 13 deals with transaction values totaling more than $38 billion.

His Beverly Hills-based private equity firm raised a combined $1.1 billion on three SPACs in March alone.



Gores also closed the largest SPAC transaction to date with a combination of Pontiac Mich.-based United Wholesale Mortgage and Gores Holdings IV Inc. The January merger had a valuation of about $16 billion.



Sonder expects to achieve about $4 billion of revenue by 2025 and believes its technology-driven service model can reduce operating costs by half compared with traditional hotels.



Chief Executive and co-founder Francis Davidson came up with the idea for Sonder while managing apartments for short-term stays as a university student in Montreal.

Sonder which has collected more than $560 million in investor funding since it launched in 2014 partners with companies including Airbnb Inc. Booking.com and Expedia Group Inc. to reach customers.



The company has 4500-plus listings in 30 cities in eight countries. Sonder estimates that it attracts more than 1 million guests annually for its 300-plus properties.



SPACs are essentially a corporate shell through which investor money is raised via a public offering.



Shares in the companies tend to trade around their IPO prices at least until there’s some movement to purchase a company and take it public. A SPAC has anywhere from 18 months to two years to do an acquisition with a private company.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Underneath the carpet was a hidden staircase that led to a huge dark and unused basement with Abi convinced that someone had been down there.

In the video that has been watched over 731k times she said: ""I can't believe what we've just found in our storage cupboard.""

""Someone has 100% been down here"" she claimed.

There was hardly any light down in the basement and the walls looked old and were crumbling apart in places.

There was a piece of scratched art on the walls and rubble on the floor with Abi captioning her video: ""Wtaf ! This is scary!""

People were just as freaked out as her with thousands commenting on the clip and urging Abi to move out of her house.

One person commented: ""Na I'd be moving.""

Another said: ""Pack up and get the funk out of town.""

Others said the basement looked like something out of horror movie The Conjuring with one viewer suggesting: ""Just close it up and act like you never found it.""

One more teased: ""Bruh you've released the spirits now!""

Some people however were quick to point out that many old homes comes with hidden basements and others said it looked like it would have been used during World War II.

An extra space for all the activities others advised renovating the cellar to get the use out of it.

One person wrote: ""Get it sorted out properly and boom games room.""

JD.com and ExxonMobil made joint announcement on May 7 to deepen cooperation in three main areas in China which include user engagement digitalized e-commerce operation and omni-channel service network.

“This cooperation marks a key milestone of the partnership we reached last May to leverage both sides’ strength in intelligent supply chain to coalesce brands platforms and customers and to co-create customized products and enhance service efficiency” said Qin Miu vice president and head of life & service business division of JD.com.

“We hope this upgraded cooperation with JD will bring more high-quality products and car maintenance services for Chinese customers” noted Chunyang Yue managing director of ExxonMobil (China) at the signing ceremony held during the China International Products Expo in Hainan province.

Based on the agreement JD Auto will become one of the first online platforms to launch Mobil’s new products in China. Furthermore the two sides will integrate JD’s Customer-to-Manufacturer approach and Mobil’s oil analysis programs Mobil Serv℠ to create more tailor-made lubricant products for Chinese customers.

Mobil’s products are sold on JD.com through both JD’s self-operated online store and the brand’s flagship store. The former became the first store to surpass 3 million followers in the motor oil category on JD’s platform.

From online ordering to offline services the two sides will embrace omni-channel solutions to create more reliable and easily accessible services. No matter whether the products are delivered to customers’ homes or their designated nearby JD Auto Service stores customers are guaranteed the standardized prices and service quality provided by both JD and Mobil. Meanwhile they will be able to enjoy more shared benefits from both JD Auto and Mobil’s membership programs.

With JD’s extensive capabilities in digitalization the cooperation will also give a boost to the global motor oil giant on digital marketing and e-commerce implementation in the Chinese market.

Adams who had been acclaimed in the role and had held ExxonMobil and other companies to account had his contract terminated on November 23rd 2020.

In the advertisement in today’s Sunday Stabroek the government said that the applicant should possess doctoral or postgraduate qualifications in Environmental Science Natural Science or any related field and at least eight years’ experience in environmental protection conservation pollution prevention and control or environmental management.

Experience should also include finance administration project and human resource management. The advertisement said that experience in environmental policy development and implementation will be strongly desirable as well as “strong public speaking and interpersonal skills”.

Which academic or extracurricular achievement are you most proud of during business school? The extracurricular achievement that I am most proud of was Wharton’s inaugural Historically Black Colleges & Universities (HBCU) Outreach Program that I was able to design and sponsor with the Admissions Team. As a proud graduate of an HBCU increasing representation in these majority spaces such as Ivy League institutions and corporate America has always been important to me. Realizing I was 1 of 3 HBCU graduates in a class of 856 was disheartening.

This program allowed me to mentor and assist ~80% of admitted HBCU students to Wharton’s Deferred Admissions Program for graduating college seniors. I also worked to partner with the black affinity groups to provide housing for prospective students recruit current student volunteers to participate and allow the prospectives to take part in the affinity group’s Pub Event to further experience the black culture at Wharton. Partnering with the Senior Associate Director of Diversity Admissions this event was reimagined during COVID-19 by coordinating a virtual Visit Day that was open to HBCU alum and current HBCU students. With the virtual sessions and success of the Inaugural year attendance doubled therefore increasing access and knowledge for these underrepresented minoritized groups.

What achievement are you most proud of in your professional career? Entering Corporate America as a young black female engineer working in the white-male dominated oil and gas industry in the Deep-South I realized that I was working in a space that was devoid of who I was. Not knowing this would lead to a career in Diversity and Inclusion years later I thought I should educate my peers and superiors about the prominent examples of black excellence who influenced me.

I decided to join ExxonMobil’s black affinity group and became the Cultural Awareness Chairperson. I revamped the Black History Month series to include prominent black figures aspects of black culture and honor living legends within our own community. The event led to over 400 employees and community members attending which well exceeded previous programs. The success of the event received local news coverage and accolades through ExxonMobil’s upper management team. I was able to also reimagine this effort when I pivoted job roles to a new location and was surprised when I learned that the event had been heard of from Beaumont TX to Baton Rouge LA. This event is a legacy I have left behind and to this day is my most cherished moment.

Why did you choose this business school? I chose Wharton because I knew this school would take me completely out of my comfort zone and challenge me in ways that I could never imagine. After meeting with several Wharton students alumni and faculty during my campus visits I was exposed to the rigorous academic community and the campus’ entrepreneurial spirit. However it was Wharton’s outspoken commitment to diversity that cemented my decision to attend. The support that I received from the Black community and beyond was simply immeasurable.

When it came to decision time I narrowed it down to two programs. One I felt was the “dream”; it checked all of the boxes of what I wanted out of my MBA. But Wharton was the goal; it became what I needed. I thought about my two-year versus my 20-year life plans and made the decision that this is where I needed to be. My experience here has been nothing short of transformative. Choosing Wharton was one of the best decisions that I’ve ever made and I grow more appreciative of the experiences gained every day.

Who was your favorite MBA professor? Dr. Stephanie Creary the professor of the management course Leading Diversity in Organizations. Not only did I have the opportunity to learn how to become a more effective inclusive manager in her class but I was also fortunate enough to work as her Research and Teacher’s Assistant. Working with such an influential D&I practitioner encouraged me to consistently challenge the status quo.

What was your favorite MBA event or tradition at your business school? The Cluster Olympics hands down! This was a part of our three-week orientation where all four clusters of ~210 students each competed in a variety of games and activities to see who had the most school spirit (It felt like a high school pep rally). I was fortunate to be one of the co-choreographers for our dance competition which was really special. It allowed me to return to my roots as a trained dancer as well as meet one of my favorite people at Wharton.

Looking back over your MBA experience what is the one thing you’d do differently and why? I would’ve taken advantage of opportunities to meet new and exciting classmates. During my first year at Wharton I de-prioritized travel and random coffee chats with my fellow students to focus on other aspects of my MBA thinking I could fully delve into developing better networking and socialization my second year. Then COVID-19 hit and everything changed. So going to grab lunch with a stranger became a foreign concept and big class trips were non-existent. While I still feel that I met wonderful human beings throughout these two years I wish I didn’t take those other opportunities for granted.

What is the biggest myth about your school? I would say the biggest myth is that Wharton is “just a finance school.” I have met people from different walks of life who plan to transition into many different arenas besides finance. There are entrepreneurs starting up their ventures marketing gurus and people who are just trying to save the world one nonprofit at a time. And of course people do come to Wharton with Finance backgrounds to continue in that space and that’s great too! But everyone has a different story and no one person’s journey is alike which I love. Wharton is truly a diverse place and my classmates are proof of that.

What surprised you the most about business school? The thing that surprised me most about business school was that you can create your own path. I realized that you can focus on whatever aspect of life that you want whether its academics professional development leadership or networking. And if you want you can do a bit of everything – at Wharton the world is your oyster!

What is one thing you did during the application process that gave you an edge at the school you chose? I applied through a preparatory program called Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT) and was provided a great deal of guidance through MLT alum and coaches. They challenged me to expand my options for MBA programs to include Wharton. My coach Coach Krista was phenomenal in guiding me through the process the entire way.

Which MBA classmate do you most admire? Nicole Allain-Stockton if you are reading this just know that I admire you. It’s funny because Nicole and I were a part of similar spaces throughout the MBA application process and even our first year at Wharton but didn’t really connect until COVID-19 hit. But over this year I got to know her on a personal and professional level. This amazing black woman from a Finance background (ironic huh) who plans to continue crushing the industry post-graduation ceases to amaze me. She took one of Wharton’s most premier conferences the 47th Whitney M. Young Conference and turned it into a masterpiece. To see her dream big like no other and do the unthinkable with this conference all in a virtual setting was truly inspiring. On top of that she has widened my worldly views while always challenging them (We often debate for hours at a time) and has introduced me to different perspectives that I am so excited to explore. She is the epitome of #BlackGirlMagic and for her I am grateful.

How disruptive was it to shift to an online or hybrid environment after COVID hit? I will say that shifting to an online learning environment was initially a struggle for me. I have never preferred online learning and have always thrived in hands-on learning environments. I even considered deferring for a year to see what would happen with the development of COVID-19. However Wharton’s dedication to providing an equitable and engaging online environment convinced me to carry on with my education according to plan.

When the first semester of my second-year hit Wharton administration and faculty worked diligently to make sure that we could have the best experience possible inside and outside of the classroom. Professors worked tirelessly to alter their curriculum and make sure that the hybrid model was as robust as possible. And lastly I was able to build deeper connections with people and explore other interests that I might not have been able to do otherwise. While this process has definitely been a huge adjustment I was still able to have a fulfilling MBA experience.

Who most influenced your decision to pursue business in college? My younger (bigger he’s an entire foot taller than me) brother Cazembe influenced my decision to pursue my MBA. We are only 18 months apart but are the best of friends. Through the pursuit of my MBA he was my biggest supporter. He was there for every tear shed during a GMAT disappointment every jump for joy when receiving my acceptance letters and everything in between. He encouraged me to keep pursuing my dream even when I didn’t believe in myself. He was the best person to talk to my parents to help them understand why I would be leaving this great job to go back to school full-time (now they’re 100% on board). And finally to see him pursuing his PhD which he completed in 2020 and his thirst for knowledge made me want my MBA even more. He is a role model to me and has been there since day one.

What made Ayanna such an invaluable member of the Class of 2021?

“Ayanna Kennedy has been nothing short of exceptional as a student and community member at the Wharton School. In addition to her academic accomplishments she has made a meaningful impact on the diversity recruitment efforts in the MBA Admissions Office over the entire course of her MBA experience.

When Ayanna was admitted to the program we knew that she had a general ethos of wanting to improve the diversity of student representation in the MBA program at Wharton. However we soon learned that she had a particular interest in supporting students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) which was a population of students who we hadn’t recruited aggressively. Ayanna assumed that she would work in collaboration with the Director of the Moelis Advance Access Program in order to support the office’s programming for undergraduate students attending HBCUs. However when that director was suddenly hired for a new role outside of Wharton Ayanna stepped up to fill the void in HBCU programming by taking on more responsibility and executing the first ever campus visit program for students from HBCUs. To be frank Ayanna led much of the planning and execution of the event and while it certainly wasn’t perfect it was quite successful in exposing HBCU students to the Wharton community and encouraging them to apply.

Our office learned a lot of helpful lessons about recruiting HBCU students from Ayanna’s efforts last year and this year we are building upon her pilot program. More broadly Ayanna has been available for collaboration support and lending her voice to inspire underrepresented students to consider Wharton. In her second year she assumed the role of Diversity Admissions Fellow to help Wharton become a more equitable and inclusive place as well as to work in collaboration with other diversity organizations in order to help advance the representation of underrepresented populations. Ayanna is smart kind hardworking and an important member of our community. We will miss her when she graduates from Wharton but her positive impact on recruitment will endure. Ayanna Kennedy is one of Wharton’s best and brightest.”

The strike began March 30.

“The company demands that we accept a permanent second tier of health insurance for new hires and establishing expensive premiums for current workers” a union statement said after the company announced its threat. “ATI has been trying to divide and conquer the USW membership at our plants since locking us out in 2015 and probably longer. We have shown management at every step that our solidarity will not be broken.”

The day after the ultimatum expired the union organized a solidarity motorcycle ride to visit the picket lines in Vandergrift Latrobe Washington and Brackenridge of 20 to 25 riders. This Militant worker-correspondent joined up with them.

Retiree Skip Longdon former unit chair of Local 7139 here rode a motorcycle with a sticker saying “Thou Shalt Not Scab.” “A lot of guys on this ride are retirees but our hearts are still at the plant and we stand with the guys” Longdon said. “We still go to the picket lines to help out in every way we can.”

When asked why he organized the bike ride Keith Beavers president of Local 1138 in Vandergrift said “We wanted to bring the guys together to do something positive to show solidarity.”

Beavers said anyone who wants to help can “come hang out at the picket lines bring your family friends whoever it’s that kind of support we need. Hanging out on the lines talking with us about the issues and spreading the word is the most important — Solidarity.”

Bosses say workers have to give more

ATI spokeswoman Natalie Gillespie said the company’s old offer had “expired.” Their new offer she said among other things will reduce a lump-sum payment in the first year from $4000 to $2500. And she said the union will have to back off on health care and job security. ATI recently announced they took in $693 million in the first three months of 2021.

“Each of our business units must earn more than its costs of capital on a stand-alone basis” CEO Robert Wetherbee said. “The Specialty Rolled Products business has struggled to consistently meet this profitability threshold for some time. … So we’re decisively taking the actions necessary to fix it.”

While the company says they’ll offer some wage increases “we only get these raises if we agree to take concessions in other places” USW negotiating committee member Randy Denman Jr. from the plant said in a statement given to me. “I believe this contract will destroy our union cost us our health care and retirees their health care.”

Japanese design has long been highly regarded for upholding cherished tradition and values while fearlessly pushing the envelope.

This unique ingenious fingerprint that has given Japan a distinguished place in the global scene is just one of the reasons why leading developer Federal Land Inc. has collaborated with Japanese firms to deliver innovative real estate offerings in the Philippines.

“We’ve always admired the efficiency and effectiveness of Japanese design as reflected in various aspects of Japanese life” explained Cherie Fernandez project development group head of Federal Land.

Ultimately the goal is to help enhance and redefine the Philippine real estate industry by melding Filipino and Japanese excellence in premium resilient structures.

Commitment to excellence

One development that proves Federal Land’s commitment to do so is The Seasons Residences a premier four-tower residential project with a mall component at its podium.

Set for completion in 2027 The Seasons Residences will rise along 8th Avenue within Federal Land’s 10-ha Grand Central Park community in North Bonifacio Global City. The masterplanned project patterned after the Big Apple gives residents convenient access to both essentials and wants even in a pandemic or emergency.

The Seasons Residences is neighbors with Grand Hyatt Manila and its branded residences modern residential towers Park Avenue Park West Central Park West Madison Park West and Time Square West upscale retail hub The Shops at Grand Central Park and the highly anticipated Japanese mall MITSUKOSHI.

The four-story MITSUKOSHI mall brings to the country premium commercial spaces that showcase Japanese design elements in a casual but elegant setting. It will feature a depachika or basement food shops as well as a wide array of Japanese beauty brands.

Also near are schools healthcare facilities places of worship and malls. Upcoming projects BGC-Ortigas Road Link the Metro Manila Subway BGC-NAIA Bus Rapid Transit and the Makati-Taguig Skytrain will benefit dwellers even more.

Strategic partnerships

For this upscale undertaking Federal Land entered a joint venture with Nomura Real Estate Development Co. Ltd. and Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings Ltd. to form Sunshine Fort North Bonifacio Realty Development Corp.

Tie-ups with Japanese firms have worked well for the prime developer with both being very hands-on to ensure outcomes that reflect local sensibilities and elevate standards.

Renowned architectural planning and engineering company Nikken Sekkei collaborated with local firm Casas+Architects and GF & Partners to conceive the conceptual design for this much anticipated address. Other Japanese experts pitched in for the interior design and façade concept and other facets of this upscale residential project.

Nikken Sekkei global design head Masakazu Kimura said the planners “strived hard to bring Japanese lifestyle design and traditions to the Philippine market. We accepted this challenge looking deeply at Japanese domestic life extracting lessons that could possibly apply to a modern Manila family.”

The resulting idea gave Federal Land another prestigious award as The Seasons Residences is an award winner for the Philippines’ Best Residential High-Rise Development at the 2021-2022 International Property Awards Asia Pacific.

Behind this award winning structure is that distinct Japanese touch.

Japanese touch

The towers of The Seasons Residences are named after Japanese seasons namely Haru (spring) Natsu (summer) Aki (autumn) and Fuyu (winter) with the first two already pre-selling. These reappear in the palettes and facilities on the amenity floor: Active Spring Breezy Summer Creative Autumn and Dreamy Winter.

The one- to three-bedroom units have storage systems akin to those in Japanese apartments including floor storage in the kitchen. A sunken slab puts the drainage system below the flooring protecting against water damage and making pipe maintenance easier. Select three-bedroom units feature a genkan or a foyer.

The Season Residences embraces technology as well as units come with a range hood with advanced oil-filter technology air-washing tiles and a shower toilet. The building also features a card-controlled security system and motion-sensor lighting double glazed e-glass and operable windows and top-of-the-line fire detection and alarm systems.

Resilient structures

Structural integrity is another strong point of The Seasons Residences Fernandez pointed out.

“The materials we used for the structural system came from the same Japanese supplier behind various infrastructure projects in Japan and the construction process is supervised by a Japanese management team assuring the project’s quality from design to materials to execution” she said.

Consultants from engineering firm Arup ensured that the towers can withstand earthquakes and high winds common to both the Philippines and Japan.

“The building is equipped with a damped outrigger system” explained Arup. “This damping system is a combination of concrete outriggers connected from the core wall to perimeter columns with viscoelastic dampers.”

The Seasons Residences uses the viscoelastic coupling dampers developed by Nippon Steel Engineering. Some 256 panels absorb vibrations and dissipate sway ensuring stability and improving comfort during seismic and weather events. The technology secures tall structures like the Tokyo Skytree Taipei 101 and Grand Hyatt Manila.

Also considered in the design were the West and East Valley Faults the Philippine Fault System and Manila Trench. The Seasons Residences were likewise subjected to the Wind Tunnel Test and Site-Specific Hazard Assessment.

With The Seasons Residences you don’t only get a fine home in a thriving hub you get a monument to Japanese and Filipino genius that will last you more than a lifetime.

That's the message we can all embrace from a 10-year-old Indianapolis girl. It's also the message Quinn McGill took all the way to the mayor’s office after weeks of sadness in the Circle City.

Six days after the FedEx tragedy McGill wrote a letter to Mayor Joe Hogsett. In it she asked him to make May 10th “Be a Friend Day.” The idea is simple-- be a friend celebrate old friends and make new friends -- but the meaning is so much deeper.

“I want people to write letters to friends far away to celebrate it and make new friends and learn more about people they don’t really know and be nice to everyone” McGill said.

Her mom Tristan Litz said she did not think the mayor would actually respond to her daughter Quinn but he did. The Mayor’s Office said Hogsett signed a proclamation declaring Monday May 10 officially “Be a Friend Day.”

Litz said she could not be any prouder of her daughter.

“As a mother I try really hard to plant little seeds that I hope will make a difference long after I’m gone. I’ll plant seeds that they will help to plant later. It means a lot to me that we’re already seeing those things bloom now” Litz said.

McGill got a jumpstart on it all Sunday afternoon. She sat down and started writing to an old friend who moved away named Harper.

“Just glad that in little ways we can make a difference in the world but some days you don’t feel like you can but a day like today makes you feel like you can” Litz said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZkaWdlc3QuY29tL3N0b3J5L2JyeXNvbi1kZWNoYW1iZWF1LWZpbmFsLXJvdW5kLXdlbGxzLWZhcmdvLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC1xdWFpbC1ob2xsb3fSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2xmZGlnZXN0LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9icnlzb24tZGVjaGFtYmVhdS1maW5hbC1yb3VuZC13ZWxscy1mYXJnby1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtcXVhaWwtaG9sbG93L2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After costly brain cramp Bryson DeChambeau makes return to Wells Fargo worth it,Bryson DeChambeau made a very expensive mistake on Friday afternoon when he headed home for Dallas under the assumption he’d miss the Wells Fargo Championship.

The shooting happened just after midnight in a mobile home park on the east side of Colorado Springs police said.

Officers arrived at a trailer to find six dead adults and a man with serious injuries who died later at a hospital the Colorado Springs Gazette reported.

The suspected shooter was the boyfriend of a female victim at the party attended by friends family and children. He walked inside and opened fire before shooting himself police said.

The birthday party was for one of the people killed police said.

President Joe Biden urged Congress to pass gun control measures after a gunman opened fire at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis Ind. on Friday killing 8 and injuring several others.

Neighbor Yenifer Reyes told The Denver Post she woke to the sound of many gunshots.

“I thought it was a thunderstorm” Reyes said. “Then I started hearing sirens.”

Police brought children out of the trailer and put them into at least one patrol car she said adding that the children were “crying hysterically.”

Authorities say the children who weren’t hurt in the attack have been placed with relatives.

Ray Wishropp a father and grandfather beloved by his family and community died at his workplace in an act of all-too-familiar American gun violence. We should not have to fear for our lives doing something as simple as going to work or shopping at a grocery store. Our children should not have to be locked into classrooms for protection leaving teachers and parents faking smiles through their own fear as they try to provide a “normal” day for their kids.

We cannot accept this as normal.

New York is not immune to this national epidemic and to save lives and end these senseless killings we need more than thoughts and prayers we need the U.S. Senate to act on background checks on all gun sales and we need continued commitment from our leaders to fight gun violence.

Because of loopholes in our current laws nearly a quarter of Americans who obtain firearms do so without obtaining a background check—including criminals domestic abusers and other prohibited buyers. And every day in America more than 100 people are killed from gun violence and hundreds more are injured.

As volunteer leaders with Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America we’ve seen the devastation left behind as families and communities are shattered in the wake of gun violence. We are grateful that Senators Schumer and Gillibrand support a strong background check bill and urge them to make it a priority in the Senate.

Reicher said that he purchased his solar shingles through SunCommon Waterbury which has become the dealer and installer of the Tesla shingles for Vermont and the Hudson Valley in New York.

“Tesla sent one of their chief technicians from California to work with SunCommon on the installation” Reicher said.

Reicher said that in Vermont 20000 roofs are installed each year along with 2000 solar arrays.

“The opportunity here is that instead of waiting for solar panels this offers the chance for a two-fer a roof and the ability to generate electricity in the same product” Reicher pointed out.

He said he’s been interested in solar shingles since the 1990s when the idea began to take hold that it might be possible to make roofing shingles capable of generating electricity. He’s been carrying around a prototype from the 1990s ever since!

The solar shingles are going on an addition to his Galloping Wind Trail home in Warren.

“What distinguishes this from other attempts is that if you saw the roof it looks very uniform both the side that gets a lot of sun and the one that doesn’t. The sun-side shingles are active and the shade-side are passive” he explained.

“This solar roof alone won’t power our house. The house is 3000 square feet. But we have an electrical heat pump and a plug-in vehicle. We’ve done a lot of efficiency improvements and we also own a piece of the community solar system in Waitsfield” he added.

The new solar roof will function in combination with his family’s other work to reduce their carbon footprint.

Reicher said that there were significant federal tax credits and state incentives to install the roof and noted that the solar roof was cheaper than the other alternatives he considered such as a standing seam roof with solar panels. He said the cost was roughly comparable to asphalt shingles with solar panels.

The solar shingles have a warranty that extends 30 years for solar production. The shingles are made of high integrity glass. The solar shingle pieces snap together like flat Legos creating a circuit to make the electrical connection.

“Like all solar products their output will deteriorate over decades so you’re buying it for shelter and electricity production” Reicher said.

The two companies include Charlottesville Virginia-based Sun Tribe and Washington D.C.-based Sol Systems.

The solar systems will be built on former coal mines located within the Cumberland Forest Project—nearly 253000 acres of land in Southwest Virginia Eastern Tennessee and Eastern Kentucky managed by TNC and owned by its Cumberland Forest LP impact investment fund. The Cumberland Forest Project is aimed at protecting and restoring globally important Appalachian forests which are some of the most important areas for climate resiliency in North America.

Sun Tribe and Sol Systems—chosen in part because of their shared and demonstrated commitment to community-focused impact and results—will develop the projects with the aim of continuing TNC's goal of supporting local economies through conservation investment and engagement.

“Southwest Virginia and the wider Central Appalachian coalfield region is uniquely positioned to support the expansion of renewable energy development with hundreds of reclaimed former surface mines potentially capable of being converted to new solar projects” says Brad Kreps director of TNC’s Clinch Valley Program. “At this point the region’s former mined lands are nearly a blank canvas when it comes to building a new renewable energy economy and with this partnership we hope to demonstrate how some of these former mining sites can be competitive for solar development in Virginia and throughout the Central Appalachian region.”

The Cumberland Forest Project was developed to show that investments in nature can yield financial returns and critical conservation results while returning value to local communities. This is especially important in the Central Appalachian region which is undergoing a profound transition as the coal industry declines and the area seeks to develop a more diverse economy while building on its strength as an energy producer.

“We’re a proud Virginia-based company and we’re looking forward to working with communities throughout this region to show that solar can provide real environmental social and economic benefits for those who call Central Appalachia home” says Danny Van Clief CEO of Sun Tribe Development. “We are focused on an approach that combines a conservation focus comprehensive scale and an intense focus on local community investment. Turning this vision into reality will mean that these former coal mines which have served these communities for generations as energy assets can continue to serve them for generations to come in a bright future.”

On the vast majority of the Cumberland Forest TNC’s aim is to protect and restore native forests but there are several thousand acres of non-forested former surface coal mines on the property that can potentially support new solar energy projects create positive economic outcomes for local people and provide clean energy from previously disturbed sites in a way that minimizes impact to the environment. The initial focus area for the collaboration with Sun Tribe and Sol Systems centers on Wise County in Southwest Virginia.

“This collaboration highlights Sol Systems’ mission to pair new solar energy infrastructure investment with concrete and scalable community sustainability and environmental impact” says Yuri Horowitz CEO and co-founder of Sol Systems. “We’re excited to be working with The Nature Conservancy and its Cumberland Forest Project along with Sun Tribe to create new long-term opportunities for communities and neighbors in Southwest Virginia.”

Cumberland Forest Solar Siting and Developer Selection Process

In pursuing solar development on the Cumberland Forest property TNC is taking a strategic approach to create positive outcomes for both nature and people. In early 2020 with assistance from the Virginia Department of Mines Minerals and Energy TNC identified non-forested former mined lands on the Cumberland Forest property that are in proximity to existing utility lines and infrastructure making them candidates for solar development.

TNC’s scientists then conducted additional analyses of these potential solar sites to eliminate areas that possess important wildlife values natural habitats or other characteristics that make them incompatible with solar development. After that TNC engaged the private sector seeking proposals from a variety of solar developers interested in constructing solar projects on some of these identified sites. After a nine-month process Sun Tribe was selected to be the Cumberland Forest LP’s first project developer with Sol Systems selected to finance own and operate the facilities once development is complete.

“Our competitive selection process focused not only on finding capable solar developers with a strong track record but was also geared towards finding developers with a demonstrated commitment to environmental stewardship and the creation of tangible benefits to local communities” says Tom Hodgman Deputy Managing Director of Forest Investing of The Nature Conservancy’s NatureVest. “Sun Tribe and Sol Systems have committed to ensuring that the projects also benefit the communities we are trying to support with them.”

The Path Forward: Permitting and Community Engagement

Over the next two to three years Sun Tribe will conduct additional field studies pursue utility interconnection agreements and submit local and state level permit applications on sites located within the Cumberland Forest property.

During this initial development period Sun Tribe will also work with TNC localities the Southwest Virginia Solar Work Group and other interested stakeholders to develop a Community and Environmental Benefits Plan that will target specific investments in local workforce development economic development and environmental stewardship. Current projections assume projects will move towards construction and operation in 2023-2024.

“This is a significant economic opportunity for the region but developing solar at this scale is a complex process that requires a variety of studies and approvals related to land use the electric grid the environment and the construction and operation of the solar farms themselves” says Van Clief. “We are eager to begin working closely with the community along with the region’s educational business and environmental leaders to get these projects across the finish line.”

Enabling Renewable Energy Policies in Virginia

Much of the optimism around this project is driven by enabling policies recently passed in Virginia that encourage the development of renewable energy including solar. Over the past several years Virginia lawmakers and private business interests have taken great strides towards becoming a leader in the clean energy space. A big driver of this shift is the Virginia Clean Economy Act which was signed into law in 2020. It calls for Virginia’s electric utilities to produce their electricity from 100 percent carbon-free sources by 2050. The legislation also declares 16100 megawatts of solar and onshore wind generation facilities to be in the public interest.

Solar projects constructed on the Cumberland Forest will contribute towards these goals. In addition to the Virginia Clean Economy Act other policies have been put in motion recently to specifically encourage the redevelopment of former mined lands and brownfields as sites for renewable energy projects. For example Delegate Terry Kilgore sponsored legislation in the 2021 General Assembly Session that established the Virginia Brownfield and Coal Mine Renewable Energy Grant Fund and Program.

“As we pursue the expansion of renewable energy in Virginia it’s important to make sure that this exciting opportunity touches down across all parts of the Commonwealth” says Delegate Terry Kilgore. “This includes Southwest Virginia which has a long history of being an energy leader. I’m pleased that we now have a policy in place that incentivizes the re-use of mined lands and brownfields for renewables and I’m thrilled that The Nature Conservancy and its partners are pushing forward to demonstrate that we can develop solar in this part of Virginia.”

Local Investment; National Impact

TNC’s efforts to work with solar developers on the Cumberland Forest and in the Central Appalachians are part of a larger organizational effort focused on supporting the expansion of clean energy while simultaneously benefiting local communities and avoiding impacts to forests and other critical wildlife habitats. Part of that effort involves serving as a national leader—showing other conservation-focused organizations communities and renewable energy developers that there is a successful model for synergy between conservation and renewable energy development. Significant components of that work include siting renewable energy projects on former mined lands and brownfields and highlighting the importance of transitioning towards a culture of generation that continues to honor the region’s history as an energy center while diversifying how energy is produced.

The national impact of this work will be seen through the power of example and the creation of a new framework—a local engagement and education-focused collaboration that strives to meet the needs of local residents and places community engagement at the center of the development process. Both Sun Tribe and Sol Systems have histories of this kind of neighborhood-focused effort and will work closely with TNC to build strong solutions that bring new jobs workforce development increased tax revenue and a host of other benefits to Central Appalachia. Sun Tribe will take the lead in the permitting approval and development process while Sol Systems will finance construct own and operate each project.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY2llbnRpZmljYW1lcmljYW4uY29tL2FydGljbGUvZmlyc3QtaW4tZmxpZ2h0LW5hc2EtanVzdC1wcm92ZWQtZmx5aW5nLW9uLW1hcnMtaXMtcG9zc2libGUtbmV4dC11cC1pcy10aGUtc29sYXItc3lzdGVtMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First in Flight: NASA Just Proved Flying on Mars Is Possible--Next Up Is the Solar System,"Picture the scene: A small drone the size of a suitcase descends into a dark Martian crevasse—perhaps a lava tube that was formed billions of years ago by volcanic activity on the Red Planet.

Far from being some starry-eyed flight of fancy such a mission could soon become a reality thanks to the resounding success of NASA’s Ingenuity rotorcraft sometimes referred to as a helicopter or drone—a technology demonstration that has taken place on Mars over the past few weeks. Carried to the planet by NASA’s Perseverance rover which touched down on February 18 this small machine weighing a paltry 1.8 kilograms was the first attempt at controlled aerial flight on another world—more than a century after that same feat was mastered on Earth by the Wright brothers. “We can now say that human beings have flown a rover craft on another planet” said MiMi Aung project manager of Ingenuity at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in a speech to her team from mission control following the successful first flight on April 19. “We together now have our Wright brothers moment.”

With Ingenuity’s success space scientists are contemplating the roles that aerial vehicles might play in our exploration of the solar system. Few worlds possess the necessary conditions for powered aerodynamic flight namely an atmosphere and rocky surface like that of Mars or Earth but there are two others of note. “The general technique of aerial flight is applicable to places like [Saturn’s moon] Titan and Venus” said Bob Balaram chief engineer of the Ingenuity team in a press briefing following the first flight. The latter’s exceedingly high temperatures and pressures pose some unique challenges: “Near the surface it’s closer to swimming” says Paul Byrne a planetary scientist at North Carolina State University. Yet flight there is not impossible which was proved by the Soviet Union’s Vega balloons in 1985. With a rotorcraft called Dragonfly already being developed to visit Titan in the next decade and work continuing on a conceptual successor to Ingenuity the future looks bright for aerial exploration of alien worlds. “This could be the start of a new era” Byrne says.

Ingenuity’s first flight from a strip of land on Mars’s Jezero Crater that is now dubbed “Wright Brothers Field” was modest but impressive: the planet’s atmosphere is incredibly thin just 1 percent that of Earth so generating lift is exceedingly difficult. “It’s similar to Earth at about 100000 feet above the ground” says Ben Pipenberg an engineer at defense contractor AeroVironment who helped build Ingenuity. With Perseverance watching from a safe distance Ingenuity spun its blades at 2500 revolutions per minute (rpm) to rise to an altitude of three meters where it hovered for 30 seconds and performed a 96-degree rotation. Then it descended back to the ground landing on its four legs with a total flight time of 39.1 seconds.

From there things got more complex. The second flight lasted 51.9 seconds reaching a height of five meters. And it included a lateral movement of about two meters—something not attempted in the confines of the test chamber on Earth where Ingenuity first flew in simulated Mars conditions. Flight three saw Ingenuity travel half the length of a football field some 50 meters reaching a top speed of just more than two meters per second. The fourth flight on April 30 pushed the envelope once again with Ingenuity remaining airborne for nearly two minutes—117 seconds—and reaching an impressive speed of 3.5 meters per second as it scouted a potential future landing zone over a round tripof more than 260 meters. Ingenuity’s fifth flight—completed on May 7 and initially planned to be its last—sent it on a one-way trip to the new landing zone to await the arrival of Perseverance its mother ship.

Now this wildly successful technology demonstration drone is entering a new phase of its mission—a second month-long set of more ambitious operational tests. These tests are meant to show how airborne drones “could play an active role in a future rover science mission” says Dave Lavery program executive for Ingenuity at NASA headquarters in Washington D.C. Although Ingenuity will not directly support the science objectives of Perseverance—namely looking for signs of past life on Mars—it will help scout out the rover’s potential route ahead as the team plans the optimal path through Jezero Crater’s riches. And the craft may photograph nearby locations that are not in the Perseverance’s planned path. There is even a slim chance that Ingenuity could support the rover’s later mission too—if the craft survives. “We might see about potentially looking over the rim of the crater” Lavery says.

Much has been made of how these vehicles might one day support human missions acting as reconnaissance drones for humans to scout out regions of interest near a landing site or carrying tools between locations. In the near-term prospects of more exciting robotic science are on the horizon—perhaps in the same way that the Sojourner rover in 1997 itself a prototype of wheeled exploration and part of NASA’s Pathfinder mission paved the way for its successors Spirit Opportunity Curiosity and now Perseverance. “I do think we’re going to see some flying vehicles in the future” says Michael Meyer lead scientist of NASA’s Mars Exploration Program at the agency’s headquarters. “It will now be part of our portfolio of methods that we use for exploration. There are things you can do with a helicopter that you can’t do with other platforms.”

Examples could include exploring the aforementioned lava tubes or perhaps approaching crater walls—too high and steep for a rover to scale—where a helicopter could take images and perform some up-close analysis as well. Another example could be studying recurring slope lineae dark flows on Mars that have arguably been linked to liquid water flowing on the surface. Perversely it is this possibility of water—and the accompanying risk of contamination with bacteria imported from Earth—that essentially prohibits anyone or anything from setting foot (or wheel) there to seek out signs of native Martian life. But a hovering drone could look without touching offering a novel route of exploration. “A rotorcraft would give us the ability to go and look up close at something that we would otherwise deem not suitable for a rover” Byrne says “either because of planetary protection issues or because it’s too dangerous.”

One concept for a possible aerial vehicle beyond Ingenuity is already being investigated. Known as the Mars Science Helicopter this six-bladed hexacopter would weigh nearly 30 kilograms. And it would be equipped with several kilograms worth of instruments to analyze different regions of the Martian surface and would have the ability to fly for minutes at a time over several kilometers. “We’re trying to learn from Ingenuity and ask ourselves ‘What could we accomplish if we push it further?’” says Theodore Tzanetos of JPL who is part of the Mars Science Helicopter concept team. The science such traits would afford would be tremendous bringing large swathes of the Martian surface suddenly within reach. The current distance record on Mars is held by NASA’s Opportunity rover which traveled more than 42 kilometers in a little more than 11 years. A helicopter could achieve the same feat in weeks.

Other ideas involve using rotorcraft to perform surveys of exposed water ice on regions of the Martian surface inaccessible to rovers. Drones could dive into Martian valleys such as the two-kilometer-deep Mawrth Vallis looking for evidence of clays linked to astrobiology or perhaps use instruments to probe the lower reaches of the Martian atmosphere says Shannah Withrow-Maser Mars Science Helicopter vehicle systems lead at NASA’s Ames Research Center. And this could all be done either alongside a bigger rover mission or as more cost-effective and much lighter standalone missions enabling more widespread exploration of a variety of Martian locales. “I personally would love that” Withrow-Maser says.

Elsewhere in the solar system flight options are more limited. One could imagine a rotorcraft in the atmosphere of one of the gas giants such as Jupiter or Saturn where theoretically flight would be possible. But actually getting there would be an issue. “The problem of course is slowing down and the amount of energy that would take” on arrival at the planet Byrne says. But Titan Saturn’s intriguing moon with an incredibly thick atmosphere and lakes of hydrocarbons on its surface is a very tantalizing prospect. In 2019 NASA selected a mission that would attempt to deploy the rotorcraft Dragonfly on the moon. Dragonfly is intended to launch as early as 2026 and arrive in 2034 andits team has been watching Ingenuity’s successes very closely.

“We’ve been following with great interest” says Elizabeth Turtle lead of the Dragonfly mission at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. “We’re very anxious to see what lessons we can take forward to Dragonfly.” Like Ingenuity Dragonfly will be flying autonomously so it will make use of similar onboard image processing capabilities to decide where to land on the Titanian surface. (Ingenuity performs terrain mapping by taking 30 images of the ground per second.) But Dragonfly is a mammoth compared to Ingenuity weighing nearly half a metric ton and powered by plutonium. And it is a standalone mission rather than a ride along like Ingenuity. “It’s like Perseverance [in scale] except we fly instead of drive across the surface” Turtle says.

Despite Titan being a much more distant alien world than Mars—with a light travel time from Earth of about an hour compared with up to about 20 minutes for the Red Planet—flight is relatively easier there. Titan’s gravity is only 14 percent that of Earth and much less than that of Mars while the moon’s much thicker atmosphere makes generating lift a comparative breeze. “A person could put wings on and soar over Titan’s surface” Turtle says. Winds on Titan are also much slower barely more than a kilometer an hour versus tens of kilometers an hour on Mars. And whereas Ingenuity’s blades require 2500 rpm to lift its fragile 1.8-kg body off the surface Dragonfly’s half-metric-tonbulk can be lofted just by its rotors spinning at 800 rpm. Titan’s major challenge is its temperature which averages only about –180 degrees Celsius—hence the need for a long-lived heat-generating plutonium power source. “It’s certainly cold” Turtle says. “It’s a nontrivial challenge.”

With Dragonfly on the horizon and perhaps future missions such as the Mars Science Helicopter in the works there is plenty to be excited about beyond Ingenuity. This little machine has for the first time proved flight on alien worlds is possible—from both a physical and logistical point of view. Now this exciting new era of discovery awaits and while only a handful of worlds afford the right conditions for this method of exploration the sky is very much the limit for the science that could be performed by aerial vehicles in these alien skies. “There are things to be sorted out” Meyer says. “Then I think we’re going to start seeing some new and improved helicopter platforms that can actually carry tempting payloads.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2EuZ292L3NvbGFyLXN5c3RlbS9uYXNhcy1pbmdlbnVpdHktbWFycy1oZWxpY29wdGVyLWNvbXBsZXRlcy1maXJzdC1vbmUtd2F5LXRyaXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter Completes First One-Way Trip,"NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter’s fifth flight was captured on May 7 2021 by one of the navigation cameras aboard the agency’s Perseverance rover.

The Red Planet rotorcraft headed south in support of furthering research into the potential use of aerial scouts on Mars in the future.

NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter completed its fifth flight on the Red Planet today with its first one-way journey from Wright Brothers Field to an airfield 423 feet (129 meters) to the south. After arrival above its new airfield Ingenuity climbed to an altitude record of 33 feet (10 meters) and captured high-resolution color images of its new neighborhood before touching down.

The flight represents the rotorcraft’s transition to its new operations demonstration phase. This phase will focus on investigating what kind of capabilities a rotorcraft operating from Mars can provide. Examples include scouting aerial observations of areas not accessible by a rover and detailed stereo imaging from atmospheric altitudes. These operations and the lessons learned from them could significantly benefit future aerial exploration of Mars and other worlds.

“The fifth flight of the Mars Helicopter is another great achievement for the agency” said Bob Pearce associate administrator for NASA’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate. “The continuing success of Ingenuity proves the value of bringing together the strengths of diverse skill sets from across the agency to create the future like flying an aircraft on another planet!”

The flight began at 3:26 p.m. EDT (12:26 p.m. PDT 12:33 p.m. local Mars time) and lasted 108 seconds. The Ingenuity team chose the new landing site based on information gathered during the previous flight – the first “aerial scout” operation on another world – which enabled them to generate digital elevation maps indicating almost completely flat terrain with almost no obstructions.

“We bid adieu to our first Martian home Wright Brothers Field with grateful thanks for the support it provided to the historic first flights of a planetary rotorcraft” said Bob Balaram chief engineer for Ingenuity Mars Helicopter at JPL. “No matter where we go from here we will always carry with us a reminder of how much those two bicycle builders from Dayton meant to us during our pursuit of the first flight on another world.”

The Wright brothers went on from proving powered controlled flight was possible to attempting to better understand how the new technology could be employed. In a similar fashion NASA seeks to learn more with Ingenuity how operations with next-generation helicopters could benefit future exploration of the Red Planet. This new phase will bring added risk to Ingenuity with more one-way flights and more precision maneuvering.

Having successfully landed at its new airfield Ingenuity will await future instructions relayed via Perseverance from mission controllers. The agency’s fifth rover to the fourth planet is also heading south toward a region where it will commence science operations and sample collection. The rover team’s near-term strategy doesn’t require long drives that would leave the helicopter far behind allowing Ingenuity to continue with this operations demonstration.

“The plan forward is to fly Ingenuity in a manner that does not reduce the pace of Perseverance science operations” said Balaram. “We may get a couple more flights in over the next few weeks and then the agency will evaluate how we’re doing. We have already been able to gather all the flight performance data that we originally came here to collect. Now this new operations demo gives us an opportunity to further expand our knowledge of flying machines on other planets.”

More About Perseverance

A key objective for Perseverance’s mission on Mars is astrobiology including the search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterize the planet’s geology and past climate pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith (broken rock and dust).

Subsequent NASA missions in cooperation with ESA (European Space Agency) would send spacecraft to Mars to collect these sealed samples from the surface and return them to Earth for in-depth analysis.

The Mars 2020 Perseverance mission is part of NASA’s Moon to Mars exploration approach which includes Artemis missions to the Moon that will help prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet.

JPL which is managed for NASA by Caltech in Pasadena California built and manages operations of the Perseverance rover.

Venus has been in the news a lot since last September when researchers announced the possible detection of phosphine a possible life sign in its atmosphere. On May 3 2021 NASA’s Parker Solar Probe announced another discovery: a never-before-observed natural low-frequency radio signal in the atmosphere of Venus. The probe designed primarily to study the sun came close to Venus to use it as a gravity slingshot needed to propel the probe sunward. Parker Solar Probe was at its closest to Venus yet – only about 500 miles (800 km) above Venus’ surface on July 11 2020 – when it found the surprising signal.

The researchers published their new peer-reviewed findings on May 3 in AGU’s Geophysical Research Letters.

Glyn Collinson of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and lead author exclaimed:

I was just so excited to have new data from Venus.

The measurements from Parker Solar Probe are the first new direct measurements of Venus’ atmosphere in nearly 30 years. The results also show that the atmosphere undergoes changes during the sun’s 11-year solar cycle and that it is now quite different from what it was in the past.

How did the spacecraft detect the radio signal?

It did so using its FIELDS instrument which measures electrical and magnetic fields in the atmosphere. The signal was detected when the spacecraft was closest to the planet for a period of only seven minutes. Collinson saw it in the data and recognized it saying:

Then the next day I woke up. And I thought ‘Oh my god I know what this is!’

He had seen the exact same kind of radio signal before from the Galileo orbiter which had explored Jupiter and its moons. That mission ended in 2003. In this case the signal which looked like a thin “frown” in the data was found in the ionospheres of some of the moons. The similarity of the signal meant that Parker Solar Probe had unexpectedly skimmed through the upper atmosphere of Venus or more specifically its ionosphere.

The ionosphere is a region of charged gases or plasma in the upper atmosphere that emits natural radio waves. Galileo had detected those radio waves at Jupiter’s moons and now Parker Solar Probe had also found them in Venus’ atmosphere. The last time Venus’ ionosphere was measured directly was in 1992 by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter. The sun also happened to be at the peak of its solar cycle at the time.

For a long time afterward however there were no more Venus missions that could take new measurements. Instead scientists relied on Earth-based telescopes which showed that the ionosphere was changing while the sun’s solar cycle started to wane again and become calmer. During solar minimum the ionosphere on Venus was at its thinnest.

Now the new measurements from Parker Solar Probe support the previous findings. The close flyby occurred six months after solar minimum – the least active period on the sun – and the data showed that again the ionosphere was significantly thinner than it was during solar maximum the most active period. This confirms that the density of Venus’ ionosphere is directly correlated to the strength of the solar cycle. According to co-author Robin Ramstad:

When multiple missions are confirming the same result one after the other that gives you a lot of confidence that the thinning is real.

As outlined in the paper:

On July 11 2020 NASA’s Parker Solar Probe made a close flyby of Venus. During the 7 minutes around the closest approach one of its scientific instruments detected low-frequency radio emission of a type naturally generated by planetary ionospheres. By measuring the frequency of this emission we can directly calculate the density of the ionosphere around Parker finding it to be far less dense than previous missions have encountered. This supports the theory that the ionosphere of Venus varies substantially over the 11-year solar cycle.

Why is this important?

Scientists want to better understand how Venus changed from a former habitable world according to the latest research to the inhospitable inferno we see today. The fact that the planet’s ionosphere thins at solar minimum can provide valuable clues as to how the sun affects Venus’ atmosphere. It is also known that the planet’s ionosphere can “leak” into space. Changes like that can tell scientists how the atmosphere has evolved over time.

The discovery of the radio signal is a fortuitous development since Parker Solar Probe’s main mission is to study the sun not Venus. As Parker Solar Probe project scientist Nour Raouafi commented:

The goal of flying by Venus is to slow down the spacecraft so that Parker Solar Probe can dive closer to the sun. But we would not miss the opportunity to gather science data and provide unique insights into a mysterious planet such as Venus.

Parker Solar Probe took some stunning images of Venus during its flyby which NASA released on February 24 2021. It also imaged the entire dust ring that orbits the sun along Venus’ orbit the first time that has ever been accomplished by any spacecraft.

There are no current U.S. missions at Venus so these close flybys provide a great opportunity to gather more data. As Collinson noted:

To see Venus now it’s all about these little glimpses.

Bottom line: NASA’s Parker Solar Probe has detected an unexpected natural radio signal being emitted by Venus’ ionosphere.

S. Senator,"By Karen Stokes

Wisconsin Teamsters Joint Council 39 announced its endorsement of businessman Alex Lasry for the U.S. Senate today at a press conference at Teamsters Local 200 6200 W Bluemound Rd.

This is the first labor endorsement for any candidate in the 2022 Wisconsin Senate race.

“Receiving the first union endorsement of this race is an important step toward building the momentum needed to flip this Senate seat and start delivering real results for Wisconsinites” Lasry said.

Teamsters Joint Council 39 represents more than 18000 workers at four locals across Wisconsin.

“We’re proud to endorse the next senator for the State of Wisconsin” said Thomas Bennett secretary-treasurer of General Teamsters Local Union No. 200. “One thing Alex brings to the table is he already knows the state of Wisconsin is a whole state.”

Lasry senior vice president of the Milwaukee Bucks is on leave from his executive position.

According to Lasry for Wisconsin he was involved in securing a labor agreement between the team and building trades that covered both the construction of Fiserv Forum and the nearby Deer District. He led negotiations for a historic project labor agreement that included provisions to hire women and minorities that are often underrepresented among union workers.

“His efforts to provide union jobs as part of the Fiserv Forum construction is a prime example of his record of putting his support of organized labor into action” said Joint Council 39 Political Coordinator Bill Carroll in a press release.

Lasry is joining a growing field of Democrats vying to take on Republican Sen. Ron Johnson’s seat in 2022.

No word yet on whether Johnson will seek a third term.

Democratic opponents for the nomination so far are State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski radiologist Dr. Gillian Battino and Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson.

“We have tried to operate and tried to show that progressive values are actually good for the economy and good for business” Lasry said. “The best way to do that is to make sure people have the ability to have a voice in the business and can collectively bargain and unionize.”

“This is going to be a staple of our campaign and a staple when I’m the next U.S. Senator that unions will be brought back to have a voice of the people working there and have a say on how companies are growing because this is how we’re growing the middle class again and making sure America is continuing to grow moving forward” Lasry said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Vote for your favorite in our poll at the bottom of the article.

Ford Mustang

You can’t put together a list of horse-named cars and not feature the Mustang – the longest-running production run of an original pony car in existence.

There are two theories on how the Mustang got its name:

Robert J. Eggert Ford’s division market research manager in the early 1960s loved American Quarterhorse breeds. His wife gifted him a book titled The Mustangs by J. Frank Dobie that inspired the pony car’s name.

Ford’s executive stylist at the time Pres Harris named the car after the WWII fighter aircrafts named Mustang.

Either way the iconic galloping horse emblem adorned on each Mustang’s grille lands the pony car a spot on our list.

Subaru Brumby

Subaru Brat | Subaru photo

These funky-looking trucklets were called the Subaru Brat in the US which stood for Bi-drive Recreational All-terrain Transport. They came equipped with four-wheel drive and four seats – two of which were mounted in the truck bed.

Because of the negative meaning behind Brat Australia gave this compact pickup the name Brumby after the indigenous feral horses found throughout that continent.

Mitsubishi/Dodge Colt

Mitsubishi started production on these boxy subcompact cars in the early 1960s and imported them to the US from 1971 to 1994 for Dodge to rebadge and sell.

These small cars were given the fitting name “Colt” a term used for young male horses.

Ford Bronco

Of course the ever-so popular Ford Bronco takes up space on this list.

When Ford was drawing plans for this four-wheel-drive SUV the engineers playing off the Mustang called it the Bronco.

When the time came to finalize the name “Wrangler” was thrown into the mix but Bronco stuck.

Hyundai Pony

You might recognize this small hatchback as the Hyundai Excel that was introduced to the US in 1986 as an export version of the Pony that went into production in South Korea in the mid-1970s.

Hyundai recently retrofitted its original Pony model with modernized features and technology to celebrate the model that “heralded the dawn of Korea’s automotive industry” Hyundai said.

The car’s name refers to a small horse no taller than 13.2 hands or about 54 inches fits perfectly for its small stature.

Rolls-Royce Camargue

Sammy Davis Jr.’s 1977 Camargue | Uncrate photo

Not fit for barn but luxurious enough to be named after one of the oldest horse breeds in the world tracing to the south of France the Rolls-Royce Camargue coupe was in production from 1975 to 1986.

Rolls made only 531 example of what some say is the worst-looking Rolls-Royce.

In a 1975 MotorSport Magazine review of the Camargue an editor wrote: “It looks rather as though Farina has tried to bend the very handsome lines of his Fait 130 Coupe design around an over-large Rolls-Royce radiator – and failed.”

Too harsh? Nevertheless it’s horse-themed name makes the car a member of our list.

Ford Pinto

1974 Ford Pinto Squire

This infamous Ford subcompact named “Pinto” after a horse that has large patches of white throughout its coat was in production from 1971 to 1980.

In the commercial introducing the Pinto Ford called it the “new little carefree car.” Carefree it was not – in rear-impact collisions the gas tank filler neck could pull loose spew gas and burst into flames.

Retrofit kits could remedy the problem but the Pinto reputation was tarnished and the cars deemed worthless.

Mitsubishi Starion

These low-key JDM sports cars were produced my Mitsubishi in the 1980s and rivaled the Nissan 290ZX and Mazda RX-7s.

The car reportedly was to be called the Stallion but apparently that was lost in translation and was morphed into “Station.”

Or if you prefer another theory the name comes from blending the words “Star” and “Orion.”

Hyundai Equus

In production from 1999 to 2016 these full-size sedans made by Hyundai were luxury bargains compared to its competitors like the Lexus LS Audi A8 and Mercedes-Benz S-Class.

This car isn’t named for a horse but from the word Equus which literally is “horse” in Latin.

Pegaso is not just a car but a Spanish truck tractor and sports car manufacturer founded in 1946 and took over by manufacturer Iveco in 1994.

By the time it was forced to shut the doors Pegaso manufactured about 350000 vehicles including its most-known z-102 and z-103 sports cars.

Pegaso is the Spanish word for “Pegasus” a mythical winged horse found in Greek mythology.

Arguably the most unusual vehicle to make this list the Haflinger was a small cab-over vehicle manufactured between 1959 and 1975 in Austria used both privately and as military vehicles.

These utility vehicles are named after a breed of horses found in Austria that are small in stature but are strong enough to carry adults.

Biden's $4 trillion infrastructure plan promises to raise wages for some workers and create many jobs.

The spending plans resemble what Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos did: both founders raised wages as their companies grew.

Ford and Bezos increased productivity which signals that Biden's plan could lift the middle class.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

President Joe Biden is a man of the middle class. At least he's trying to be.

He wants ""good jobs blue-collar jobs jobs that pay well"" he said in a White House conference at the end of March. And he wants to give the middle class a raise.

His two-part infrastructure package promises to if passed by Congress create millions of jobs and give workers a raise. ""It's time to build our economy from the bottom up and from the middle out"" he said while unveiling the package last month.

Just how many jobs his package would create is definitely in the millions but the exact number is unclear. The Biden administration has been messaging that the $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan would result in 19 million jobs over the next decade citing a report from Moody's Analytics. But that report actually says 16.3 million jobs would come from natural job growth and the $1.9 stimulus legislation and so 2.6 million new jobs would come from the infrastructure package. But that's still a lot of jobs.

As Insider's Joseph Zeballos-Roig reported at the culmination of Biden's first 100 days this approach marks a break with 40 years of presidential politics when the nation's chief executive incentivized big business aka the private sector to take the wheel. But it shares something in common with two of the greatest corporate chief executives ever: Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos.

Raising wages has already been a big issue during Biden's first months as president. He campaigned on raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 but the $15 proposal was struck from his stimulus plan for not meeting the rules of budget reconciliation. Now the job-market recovery is faltering while employers are largely not raising wages and April surprised to the downside with a gain of just 266000 jobs. The average worker hasn't received a raise since the 1970s with hourly inflation-adjusted wages only growing by 0.2% a year. The average wage as of 2018 had the same purchasing power as it did 40 years ago according to Pew.

Biden's infrastructure plan could improve working conditions. The plan is focused not just on job creation via roads-and-bridges investment but on funding for care workers and tax incentives for childcare to be provided at American workplaces. It also calls for an end to subminimum wage provisions where employers can pay disabled workers less than the federal minimum wage.

By taking a page out of the Ford playbook – and increasingly the Bezos one – Biden could be giving the middle class a much-needed lift.

Henry Ford doubled the minimum wage of his time.

Ford and Bezos raised wages to increase productivity

America's industrial middle class ascended during the last century with the help of a little mass production. In 1914 Ford Motor Co. founder Henry Ford offered factory workers $5 a day for eight hours of work. Equivalent to $120 in 2014 dollars it was more than double the minimum wage at the time NPR's Sarah Cwiek reported.

Bob Kreipke corporate historian for Ford Motor Co. told Cwiek that in raising the minimum wage Ford intended to stabilize his workforce after the advent of conveyor belts helped standardize production. The move ""raised the bar all over the world"" he said.

Turnover waned as productivity accelerated causing Ford's profits to double in less than two years. Ford later called the wage hike his ""best cost-cutting move.""

It was the beginning of what we know today as efficiency wages – paying above the market rate. This makes a job more desirable creating a larger talent pool thereby making employees more replaceable. It incentivizes employees to slack less per the Harvard Business Review.







Over a century later another leader implemented a similar strategy. In early 2021 in fact in the beginning of the Biden era Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced a pay bump of up to $3 an hour for 500000 workers as the company continues to hire. This comes after Amazon set its minimum wage at $15 in 2018 higher than its biggest competitor Walmart. Also this year the company advocated for a $15 federal minimum wage a key policy item for Biden. The federal minimum wage remains stuck at $7.25 an hour.

Bezos who is serving out his final year as CEO said he aimed for Amazon to become ""Earth's best employer and Earth's safest place to work"" in his final letter to shareholders. He said he decided to ""raise wages"" because he wanted to lead competitors to higher average hourly wage among other employers in the same labor market.

""We're not done leading"" the founder added. ""We'll do that by continuing to lead on wages on benefits on upskilling opportunities and in other ways that we will figure out over time.""

Based on the concept of efficiency wages HBR thinks it's possible Amazon's wage hike could be just as successful as Ford's. It could benefit Amazon by inducing better employee retention and productivity gains. Research has found that an unexpected pay raise motivates employees to work harder out of a sense of reciprocity.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has lately moved to boost wages.

Biden's plans could change the economy

Now Ford and Bezos' plans weren't foolproof.

Company wage hikes don't necessarily reflect a strong workforce. Productivity remains a controversial topic at Amazon where drivers recently spoke up about demanding delivery times that they said incentivize them to pee in bottles and leak period blood into their pants rather than take a break. And while the company's revenue exploded during the COVID-19 pandemic workers said they were reprimanded for taking breaks to wash their hands and sanitize stations.

And while Ford's wage hike may have boosted a more prosperous middle class the economy has since changed. University of California Berkeley labor economist Harley Shaiken told NPR that employers now view the lowest wage as the most competitive and that technology has taken precedence over stabilization. What worked for boosting the middle class economy then may not work now.

An infrastructure plan that holds the promise of pay increases and new jobs for some workers could help boost the middle class even if the federal minimum wage stays where it is as wealth inequality in the US continues to widen.

Granted some of these gains could be offset by a rise in inflation. While the economy can't yet be definitely said to be overheating as some critics charge it is seeing a supply shortage in everything from cars to hot tubs to chicken due to pent-up demand unleashed with reopening. Both Biden's administration and the Federal Reserve has insisted these shortages – and resulting price rises – are ""transitory"" and reflect a bottleneck effect as the economy kicks back into gear. In other words the economy should work out these kinks soon. Then again it might not.

While it may still be too early to measure the success of the wage hike at Amazon and we may no longer be living in Ford's economy the research is clear: increasing pay motivates employees. Seeing aspects of their strategies reappear in Biden's infrastructure plan could be a gamechanger for the economy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vYXUubGlmZXN0eWxlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9maW5hbmNlL25ld3MvZm9yZC1yZWNhbGxzLW5lYXJseS02MTctMDAwLTEyMzA0NzIzMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford recalls 661000 Explorer SUVs in North America,"By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co is recalling 661000 Explorer sport utility vehicles in North America at the request of U.S. regulators because retention pins could loosen and allow roof rail covers to detach from the vehicle.

The recall covers 2016 through 2019 model year vehicles. Dealers will install push-pins and replace any damaged rail clips and roof rail covers.

The second-largest U.S. automaker said in documents https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RMISC-21V316-0418.pdf posted Sunday that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration first inquired about the issue in early 2020 following 11 reports of roof rail cover detachment. In April it requested Ford issue a recall which the carmaker had initially said was not necessary because the low likelihood of a roof rail detaching its small weight and the fact drivers would likely detect a loose roof rail cover according to the documents.

Ford in November said it would extend its warranty to cover the issue for 10 years or 150000 miles before agreeing to the recall on April 30.

A Ford spokeswoman said Sunday the automaker is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this condition.

The vehicles covered by the recall have roof rail covers that are painted silver black or absolute black. Customer notifications will begin the week of June 28.

The recall includes 620483 vehicles in the United States 36419 in Canada and 4260 in Mexico.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % TSLA TESLA INC. 174.72 -3.09 -1.74%

Musk will join Miley Cyrus the night's musical guest amid rumors some cast members are upset at the prospect of the world's third-richest person with a net worth of $166 billion beating out celebrities and other pop culture figures.

However Musk is far from the only ""SNL"" host to not have a celebrity background to host. Throughout its more than 40-year history the popular NBC sketch show has seen countless athletes like Ronda Rousey Tom Brady Charles Barkley and Jeff Gordon lead an episode despite having little to no background in show business. Meanwhile political figures such as Rudy Giuliani John McCain Ralph Nader and Al Sharpton have been tapped to host the show in the past as well making it clear that the honor of hosting is not reserved solely for actors and actresses with something hot to promote at the time.

Perhaps one of the most historic non-traditional hosts came early on in the show’s history by way of contest-winner Miskel Spillman. Mental Floss describes the New Orleans resident as being a white-haired grinning grandmother when she was allowed to host an episode in 1977 after winning the show’s first and only ""SNL Anyone Can Host"" contest.

PETE DAVIDSON COVERS UP ARIANA GRANDE-INSPIRED NECK TATTOO WITH BOLD WORD

The outlet reports that the contest called for viewers to submit a single postcard containing 25-words or less on why they should be chosen to host. Spillman’s entry read in part: ""I need one more cheap thrill since my doctor told me I only have another 25 years left.""

However what is unique but not unheard of is Musk’s status as a business leader propelling him to enough fame or infamy to land a hosting gig. While many past hosts such as Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and George Foreman have parlayed their celebrity into business success through tequila and grill ventures respectively it was their Hollywood and sports careers that landed them the gig. However business moguls hosting the show is not exactly unheard of.

Most famously of course was Donald Trump who before becoming the president of the United States hosted the show twice in 2004 and again in 2015. A lot of the justification for Trump’s appearance on the show had to do with the success of his reality TV show ""The Apprentice."" However he was known far and wide as a businessman prior to that with a vast real estate empire.

ELON MUSK SOURCES SNL SKIT IDEAS FROM TWITTER AS REPORTS SURFACE CAST MEMBERS WON'T APPEAR ALONGSIDE HIM

Trump and Musk don’t stand alone. In 1983 Variety notes that Brandon Tartikoff fronted the show for an episode. However his inclusion was mostly justified by the fact that he was the programming head of NBC at the time who would go on to preside under the show’s most successful run of episodes throughout the 1980s.

He was preceded as a business-centric host by way of George Steinbrenner in 1990. At the time he was known as the owner and manager of the New York Yankees. According to a report from The Buffalo News at the time most of the sketches had to do with the no-nonsense MLB owner’s propensity to fire underlings.

While it’s unclear exactly what Musk will joke about when he hosts the show on Saturday there are no shortage of eccentricities within his life that the staff of ""SNL could make hay out of. Whether it's his plans for outer space or the bold decision to name he and singer Grimes' baby an unusual aviation-inspired name. Pete Davidson recently signaled at the vast array of jokes that can be made about Musk during an appearance on ""Late Night with Seth Meyers.""

""That guy's a genius. I don't know why people are freaking out. They're like 'I can't believe that Elon Musk is hosting.' And I'm like 'The guy that makes the Earth better kind of makes cool things and sends people to Mars?'"" the ""King of Staten Island"" star noted.

Regardless of what direction the episode takes Musk's inclusion as a host is not history-making for the show but it may indeed signal a paradigm shift in terms of how ""Saturday Night Live"" selects its hosts going forward.

Representatives for ""SNL"" had no comment when reached by Fox News."

Musk will join Miley Cyrus the night's musical guest amid rumors some cast members are upset at the prospect of the world's third-richest person with a net worth of $166 billion beating out celebrities and other pop culture figures.

However Musk is far from the only ""SNL"" host to not have a celebrity background to host. Throughout its more than 40-year history the popular NBC sketch show has seen countless athletes like Ronda Rousey Tom Brady Charles Barkley and Jeff Gordon lead an episode despite having little to no background in show business. Meanwhile political figures such as Rudy Giuliani John McCain Ralph Nader and Al Sharpton have been tapped to host the show in the past as well making it clear that the honor of hosting is not reserved solely for actors and actresses with something hot to promote at the time.

Perhaps one of the most historic non-traditional hosts came early on in the show’s history by way of contest-winner Miskel Spillman. Mental Floss describes the New Orleans resident as being a white-haired grinning grandmother when she was allowed to host an episode in 1977 after winning the show’s first and only ""SNL Anyone Can Host"" contest.

PETE DAVIDSON COVERS UP ARIANA GRANDE-INSPIRED NECK TATTOO WITH BOLD WORD

The outlet reports that the contest called for viewers to submit a single postcard containing 25-words or less on why they should be chosen to host. Spillman’s entry read in part: ""I need one more cheap thrill since my doctor told me I only have another 25 years left.""

However what is unique but not unheard of is Musk’s status as a business leader propelling him to enough fame or infamy to land a hosting gig. While many past hosts such as Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and George Foreman have parlayed their celebrity into business success through tequila and grill ventures respectively it was their Hollywood and sports careers that landed them the gig. However business moguls hosting the show is not exactly unheard of.

Most famously of course was Donald Trump who before becoming the president of the United States hosted the show twice in 2004 and again in 2015. A lot of the justification for Trump’s appearance on the show had to do with the success of his reality TV show ""The Apprentice."" However he was known far and wide as a businessman prior to that with a vast real estate empire.

Trump and Musk don’t stand alone. In 1983 Variety notes that Brandon Tartikoff fronted the show for an episode. However his inclusion was mostly justified by the fact that he was the programming head of NBC at the time who would go on to preside under the show’s most successful run of episodes throughout the 1980s.

He was preceded as a business-centric host by way of George Steinbrenner in 1990. At the time he was known as the owner and manager of the New York Yankees. According to a report from The Buffalo News at the time most of the sketches had to do with the no-nonsense MLB owner’s propensity to fire underlings.

While it’s unclear exactly what Musk will joke about when he hosts the show on Saturday there are no shortage of eccentricities within his life that the staff of ""SNL could make hay out of. Whether it's his plans for outer space or the bold decision to name he and singer Grimes' baby an unusual aviation-inspired name. Pete Davidson recently signaled at the vast array of jokes that can be made about Musk during an appearance on ""Late Night with Seth Meyers.""

""That guy's a genius. I don't know why people are freaking out. They're like 'I can't believe that Elon Musk is hosting.' And I'm like 'The guy that makes the Earth better kind of makes cool things and sends people to Mars?'"" the ""King of Staten Island"" star noted.

Regardless of what direction the episode takes Musk's inclusion as a host is not history-making for the show but it may indeed signal a paradigm shift in terms of how ""Saturday Night Live"" selects its hosts going forward.

Representatives for ""SNL"" had no comment when reached by Fox News."

There are few very special investors who not only have a market-beating track record for decades but have also served as mentors to other accomplished value investors such as Seth Klarman  Meryl Witmer and David Winters.Investing legend Michael Price is one such name. He is one of America’s most successful value investors and his balanced and level-headed approach towards has enabled him to generate lofty returns over the years.Price is the President and Managing Partner at MFP Investors which he started in 1991 and also a Director at Liquidnet Holdings. He is also associated with several other eminent organizations.Legendary investor Seth Klarman credits Price as being one of his main mentors.Born in 1953 Michael F Price graduated in 1973 from the University of Oklahoma with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration after which he was hired by Max Heine of Mutual Series Mutual Funds as a research assistant. He learned a lot from Max and considers him his mentor.After Max Heine’s death Price took over Mutual Series and later sold the firm to Franklin Templeton Investments. Price though continued to work with Franklin Templeton Investments until 1998 after which he became the Chairman of the Mutual Series fund. After leaving Templeton in 2001 Price started his own hedge fund MFP Investors LLC.Price’s investment philosophy is mostly based on the teachings of Max Heine. He attributes his investment approach value investing  to his mentor.Price likes to invest in companies that are going through a financial crisis and provides them with much-needed cash by buying their stocks at substantial discounts to their true value and allowing them time to recover from their problems.He tries to gain in-depth knowledge of the company’s prospects of overcoming the difficulties after which he buys a stake in it if his analysis shows that barring its financial problems the company has the fundamental attributes to make it a good investment.Price usually buys enough stake in a company to enable him to influence the decisions of the management by recommending strategies which if followed can improve company’s performance and cause the stock to appreciate.Price feels investors should have an inquisitive approach towards investing and should consider how much a company may possibly be valued when bought by some other investors.According to Price one can also take into consideration the intrinsic value of a company’s stock by using conventional metrics such as price over book value and price over cash flow.He believes investors can extensively study mergers and acquisitions to further research the buying patterns or interest of other investors. One should keep in mind that not all firms are similar and each has its unique financial and managerial structure that determines growth and profitability of the business.Further Price says investors should carefully learn about the management and determine whether it really acts in shareholders’ interest or puts their personal motives first.He further stresses the importance of determining the value of each segment of the company as separate entities. So Price feels one should evaluate a company by how much it would be worth if someone wanted to buy it today.He also offers a few tips to survive the market volatility and generate steady returns.Price feels investors should avoid holding a lot of cash because when the market rises it can be a big drag. On the other hand it is necessary to have some cash for future purchases and to protect oneself from the vagaries of the market.He advises investors to have two-thirds of their portfolio in value stocks and one-third in special situation instruments like arbitrage distressed securities besides some part in cash.If one uses this methodology even if the market declines the portfolio can outperform since special situations tend to have less correlation with the broader market.Price says one shouldn't buy a stock unless there is a strong reason to believe that it is offering a value greater than what is being indicated by its market price.Investors can conduct a thorough research to identify companies which have great potential and are undervalued Price says and adds that not every cheap stock qualifies as a ‘buy’ idea and one should follow a rigorous research process while searching for the right company to invest in.Price says investors shouldn't pay much attention to what the market is doing in the short term as 'Mr Market' is not always wise.Market's nature is so unpredictable that it may sometimes sell investors a stock at a bargain or may pay investors more than it is worth says he. Investors should avoid following the herd and look to a spot where nobody is looking. “Never never pay attention to what the market is doing. … Stay away from the crowd” he said in an interview.Price says in order to get better at investing one needs to think like a business owner. Investors should consider buying shares in a business like owning a partial stake in it.If an investor thinks a share is a piece of paper that people trade back and forth she is in deep trouble as an investor.“The key question in investing is what is it worth and what am I paying for it? Intrinsic value is what a businessman would pay for total control of the business with full due diligence and a big bank line. The biggest indicator to me is where the fully controlled position trades not where the market trades it or where the stock trades relative to peers” he says.Price says to generate returns in investing one must occasionally be contrarian and be right about that contrarian view. He says investors should look for mispriced bets which can be found mostly where only a few investors are looking.He advises investors to do original work and conduct thorough primary research before investing to find value stocks.“If you really [want] to find value you [must] do original work digging through stuff no one else [wants] to look at… The really important thing is to eliminate the Wall Street consensus the Wall Street research. You need to understand where the company is in the world and what the competition is for the products whether the products are any good and whether or not the company has any pricing power or barriers to entry… Think about the business think about what you see without any input from Wall Street do [your own] primary research” he says.Price believes extrapolating past data into the future is a very usual trick favored by many consultants and analysts but following such a methodology may do more harm than good.He says this process seems logical to some investors but it is loaded with danger as complex adaptive systems produce changes that can’t be extrapolated. “You can get lost in the spreadsheets. You can’t rely on the projections that you put in the spreadsheets alone… Depending too much on the Excel sheet to forecast discounted cash flow is a big mistake” he says.Price says investors often make the mistake of letting emotions get the better of them and hate taking losses even if they are sunk which leads to bigger losses in the long run. “The worst mistake investors make is taking their profits too soon and their losses too long” he says.Price believes the best time to start investing is when markets are going through a bad phase. He says normal investors may sell and panic in these conditions but value investors like prices to fall especially when they have dry powder and can take advantage of the drop.“A good time to start in [the investing] business is when markets are terrible… We wait for bad news… I love to read about losses. A classic value investor looks at a price drop of a stock they like as a chance to buy more whereas the ordinary investor panics and sells” he says.Investors who follow value investing principles can avoid the flip side of bubbles as value investing shines brightest when stocks are falling in price since they are purchased based on value. “It’s easy to get swept away in a growth market. But I’ve been in this business for more than 25 years and I’ve watched investors figure out a way to justify incredible multiples only to see valuations collapse back to the underlying worth of the company” he says.Many investors may be intelligent but they need to have good judgement skills which come with experience from facing the ups and downs of the market. Intelligence without judgment and the right temperament won’t make someone a good investor he says.Price believes being too intelligent can also actually be a problem since the smarter one think he is the more he may get into trouble trying to predict things that are not predictable.“A lot of people have the brains. It is the judgment with the brains that matters and that comes with experience and from thinking about things in the right way” he says.Price says the key to investment success is weathering the bear market not outperforming the bull market.(Disclaimer: This article is based on various interviews of Michael Price.)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA1LTA5L2NoaW5hLXMtbXVjaC1oeXBlZC1kaWdpdGFsLXl1YW4tZmFpbHMtdG8taW1wcmVzcy1lYXJseS11c2Vyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China's Much-Hyped Digital Yuan Fails to Impress Early Users,"Sign up for Next China a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.

Sky News has learnt that Lloyds Banking Group is close to finalising a £400m takeover of Embark Group a privately owned provider of savings and retirement products.

City sources said this weekend that an announcement could come as soon as this month.

If completed the deal will rank among Lloyds' most significant since it had to be bailed out by UK taxpayers with a £20bn capital injection in 2008.

The takeover of Embark will crystallise payouts for some of the world's largest asset managers including BlackRock Franklin Templeton and Legg Mason all of which hold minority stakes in the company.

Embark was established in 2012 by Phil Smith who remains its chief executive and a substantial shareholder.

The company which calls itself the UK's fastest-growing digital retirement group has more than £38bn under administration and close to 500000 customers across the country.

It has grown through a string of major acquisitions including that of Zurich's investment and retail platform last year.

Embark offers a range of retirement and savings products under brands such as The Adviser Centre Rowanmoor and Vested as well as that of the parent company.

It also provides white-label services for the likes of BestInvest Charles Stanley Coutts and Moneyfarm.

The company employs more than 600 people at locations across Britain including Edinburgh London and Leeds.

It competes with the likes of AJ Bell and Pensionbee which made its London stock market debut just weeks ago.

For Lloyds the takeover of Embark will represent a continuation of its strategy to expand in areas of financial services where it does not already have a market-leading position such as wealth management and insurance.

One insider said the Embark deal would plug a gap in Lloyds' retail investment proposition and open up a more effective IFA distribution channel for Scottish Widows mutual fund products.

Lloyds currently oversees about £170bn of assets through the division which includes Scottish Widows Halifax Sharedealing and the Schroders Personal Wealth joint venture it established in 2018.

News of the prospective transaction comes just days after Antonio Horta-Osorio stepped down as Lloyds' chief executive after more than a decade at the helm.

The bank's £1.9bn takeover of MBNA the credit card group announced in 2016 was the largest takeover during his stint at the helm.

Mr Horta-Osorio's successor the HSBC executive Charlie Nunn will arrive at Lloyds in August.

The company is being run in the meantime by William Chalmers its finance chief.

Embark is being advised on the talks with Lloyds by Fenchurch Advisory Partners.

The economic bellwether metal is front and center in a rally that’s driven raw materials ranging from lumber to iron ore to multiyear highs or records. Stimulus measures and vaccine rollouts are fueling prospects for a resurgence in demand that’s set to strain supply while copper’s crucial role in the green-energy transition is set to underpin longer-term gains.

Big banks and others including trader Trafigura Group have rolled out a list of lofty price targets including a prediction that copper will hit $15000 a ton in the coming decade as decarbonization drives more consumption. At the same time the pandemic has disrupted trade flows in the short term and a lack of mine investment is set to leave the market short of the supply needed to meet demand.

Yet the surge in raw materials is also stoking fears of inflation and questions are building around the need for a response from central banks. While many policy makers from the Federal Reserve on down maintain that cost increases are temporary some businesses are already announcing they’ll need to raise prices.

Copper rose as much as 2% to $10289 a ton on the London Metal Exchange before trading at $10281.50 by 10:33 a.m. in London. Prices are up more than 30% this year and have more than doubled from lows in March last year.

“It’s hard to foresee copper prices turning around amid the current bullish atmosphere” said Ji Xianfei an analyst with Guotai Junan Futures Co. Macro easing ample liquidity and a weaker dollar continue to drive the rally while the broader commodities surge is being fueled by bets on inflation Ji said.

It’s not just copper. Steel prices across Asia and North America are booming; iron ore is at a record above $200 a ton as miners struggle to keep up with the frenzied pace of consumption; and tin topped $30000 for the first time in a decade. The Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index jumped to its highest since 2011 as growth bets boost demand while poor weather hurts crop prospects and transportation bottlenecks crimp supplies.

China Risk

There are risks to the rally especially if the current strong period of manufacturing starts to ease. In China the top consumer signs are emerging that high copper prices are starting to bite and authorities have pledged to stabilize raw material prices.

China’s imports of copper ore and concentrate fell in April from the previous month according to customs data released Friday. Some manufacturers and end users have been slowing production or pushing back delivery times after costs surged the Shanghai Metals Market said last week while weaker-than-expected domestic consumption has opened the arbitrage window for exports.

Real shortages of raw materials that power the economy are driving current gains in commodities as much as anticipation of future demand and that makes it different from the last so-called supercycle according to Greg Sharenow who manages a portfolio focused on energy and commodities at Pacific Investment Management Co. The global copper market will flip into a deficit this year as demand jumps 6% Bank of America Corp. says.

Offering a fillip to prices Chile’s lower house approved a measure Thursday that would introduce progressive taxes on copper sales potentially creating a total burden of more than 80% — or almost double that of neighboring Peru and parts of Canada. That risks stalling investments in a country that accounts for more than a quarter of global supply.

The commodity surge has also sent shares of mining companies soaring. Freeport-McMoRan Inc. the biggest publicly traded copper mining company is at the highest in almost a decade while Rio Tinto Group is trading near a record high propelled by iron ore and copper prices.

Short Supply

Yet while the biggest mining enterprises are universally bullish on the outlook for copper there are few new projects on the horizon constraining future supply. Ivan Glasenberg the billionaire boss of Glencore Plc said Thursday that prices would have to hit $15000 a ton to incentivize enough new supply to meet demand.

More broadly capital investment in copper mining is expected to increase only marginally this year — to $16.2 billion from $15.2 billion in 2020 — and remain around that level for the next two years Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. forecasts.

“The copper market as it currently stands is not prepared for this demand environment” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Nicholas Snowdon wrote in a report last month. The “combination of surging demand and sticky supply has reinforced current deficit conditions and foreshadows large open-ended deficits from mid-decade.”

Sleek compact and efficient. Those are just a few words to describe the Fitbit Luxe. It's a beautiful accessory that doubles as a tracker. It lacks GPS and NFC payments but you get activity/sleep tracking heart-rate monitoring blood oxygen tracking and a stress management score.

Fitbit Luxe vs. Garmin Lily: A luxurious battle

There are usually quite a few differences when you compare the best Android smartwatches to the best fitness trackers. However some wearables are more alike than you might think. That's certainly the case when you compare the Garmin Lily and the Fitbit Luxe anyway. You might be shocked to find out there are hardly any differences between these two wearables.

Aside from their physical designs these devices are nearly identical under the hood. If you like the look and feel of a traditional smartwatch on your wrist you'll probably be partial to the Garmin Lily. If you want something smaller and more compact the Fitbit Luxe might be more up your alley. Not to mention you get a gorgeous AMOLED display rather than the grayscale LCD on the Lily.

Track your health and wellness with the elegant Fitbit Luxe

The Fitbit Luxe is the company's newest tracker intended to zero in on your health and wellness. Who's to say that it can't be fashionable too? Sure you'll get a solid selection of features but the physical design is the star of the show. Some of the best Fitbit devices include all the key features you could ever need but they may not always be the most elegant in terms of design. Fortunately the Luxe is here to change that!

As you might've guessed we're going to address the design before anything else. The Fitbit Luxe is equipped with a light but sturdy stainless steel case. You'll have three beautiful color options including Soft Gold Platinum and Graphite. The corresponding silicone band colors are Lunar White Orchid and Black. There is a special edition model that comes in a Soft Gold case with a Soft Gold stainless steel link bracelet.

While many companies don't bother with an AMOLED display on trackers Fitbit went above and beyond with the Luxe. You get a sharp AMOLED touchscreen that makes this device even more desirable. This tracker promises up to 5 days of battery life on a single charge which is slightly less than we're used to seeing from Fitbit.

Speaking of which the company is known for offering a core set of features on all of its devices. The Luxe delivers all of the essentials including activity/sleep tracking 24/7 heart-rate monitoring female-health tracking guided breathing stress monitoring and 20 exercise modes with SmartTrack exercise recognition. The company says that the Fitbit Luxe will eventually be able to take skin temperature readings and measure blood oxygen saturation levels.

This tracker follows in the footsteps of the company's advanced health smartwatch the Fitbit Sense which was released last year. The Luxe offers some of the same stress management and mindfulness tools. You get a stress management score for starters that offers a daily assessment of how well your body is handling stress. The stress management score is based on your heart rate activity levels and sleep patterns. Fitbit is planning to make this a standard feature on all of its trackers and smartwatches.

The Fitbit Luxe has a convenient Health Metrics dashboard.

The Fitbit Luxe has a convenient Health Metrics dashboard in the Fitbit app. You get an overview of your heart rate variability (HRV) breathing rate and resting heart rate (RHR). The dashboard offers a 7-day view of these metrics. If you sign up for Fitbit Premium you can track your monthly trends and personal ranges. The good news is that the Fitbit Luxe comes with a free 6-month trial of Fitbit Premium!

If you're a more advanced user you might notice some features are missing. This fitness tracker doesn't offer built-in GPS or NFC for contactless payments. These might seem like minor cons but some users won't want to live without these perks. If you're not bothered by these omissions the stylish Fitbit Luxe could be a perfect match for your tracking needs.

It's important to note that other devices from the company offer the full package. For instance when you compare the Fitbit Luxe and the Charge 4 you'll see some key differences. The Charge 4 is more affordable and it comes with both built-in GPS and NFC for Fitbit Pay. It might not be quite as fancy as the Luxe but some prefer to have more functionality than better style.

The Garmin Lily is a stunning accessory for fitness fans

When you look at some of the best Garmin smartwatches you'll notice a recurring theme. Most of these devices aren't that fashionable. Garmin makes an effort with some models more than others. For example the Garmin Lily and the Garmin Venu Sq are two smartwatches that stray from the company's usual design aspects. It's nice to see the company changing things up and trying out new designs.

As for the Garmin Lily this smartwatch is in a category of its own. It's the first Garmin wearable designed by women for women. It's certainly not a rugged and bulky device that's built for hiking in the mountains. While it might not be very alluring to serious athletes and outdoor adventurers the Lily caters to a different audience.

There are two models: the Garmin Lily Sport Edition and the Garmin Lily Classic Edition.

There are two models: the Garmin Lily Sport Edition and the Garmin Lily Classic Edition. Both variants come in a small 34mm case with a grayscale LCD touchscreen. The Sport Edition is available in three aluminum bezel colors: Cream Gold Rose Gold and Midnight Orchid. Garmin opted for 14mm proprietary silicone bands that come in in White Sand and Deep Orchid respectively. The eye-catching design makes the Garmin Lily one of the best smartwatches for women.

If you'd prefer something fancier you can choose the Classic Edition which offers a premium stainless steel bezel in Cream Gold Dark Bronze and Light Gold. The Italian leather bands come in Black Paloma and White. While the Garmin Lily bands aren't compatible with standard quick-release straps you can still search for third-party options that offer the 14mm proprietary band system. You can easily learn how to replace the bands on your Garmin Lily smartwatch.

Clearly there's a lot to say about the design. However let's not forget about all the other features you're getting as well. The Garmin Lily offers activity/sleep tracking heart-rate monitoring stress tracking blood oxygen monitoring and Body Battery. If you're not familiar Garmin's Body Battery feature estimates your energy levels throughout the day. You get a number between 1 and 100 that represents your energy level. This will help you better understand when to schedule your workouts and when it's time to rest.

When it comes to activity tracking there are multiple profiles for you to choose from on the Lily. Some of the commonly used activity tracking profiles include walking running cycling yoga cardio elliptical and breathwork. The watch can store up to seven activities which can change at any time from the Garmin Connect app.

Similar to the Fitbit Luxe the Garmin Lily is also missing built-in GPS and NFC payments. Again this might not be a devastating loss for those who are more interested in a device with a fashionable design. There are bound to be some sacrifices when you're opting for style over features but these might be worthwhile compromises if you're in love with the design.

Whether you end up choosing the Fitbit Luxe or the Garmin Lily you'll be getting a similar set of features. Neither of these wearables is quite as robust as some of the popular fitness smartwatches on the market. However they still offer the basics in an attractive package that's focused on elevating your style. Both devices are good picks for fashion-forward individuals but keep in mind that neither model offers GPS or NFC payments.

If you've always been partial to smartwatches over fitness trackers you'll more than likely prefer the Garmin Lily. It's a smartwatch but it's not huge or bulky so it's a nice option for those who want a fashionable timepiece that can also handle basic tracking. You can also choose between the Classic and Sport models.

On the other hand if you're a fan of fitness trackers over smartwatches the Fitbit Luxe will be better suited to your needs. It offers nearly all the same features as the Garmin Lily for a slightly better price. It's more compact and lightweight so it will never weigh you down. It's easy to match your tracker to your outfits and swap out bands as needed. Not to mention the colorful AMOLED display adds an extra touch of class.

The holder of the UCI Hour Record will be getting ready for the 8.6 kilometre long opening time trial in Turin with an intense tailor-made workout with users of Zwift able to join him for the ride so they can discover what it takes to get ready for a race against the clock.

""Not having fans with us at the start of races is something I have really missed” said Campenaerts in a statement. “So I've decided for the Giro I will try to go to the fans who continue to support us from home and structure my TT warm-up as a group workout on Zwift so everyone can still join us.""

Click here to follow our live coverage of the Turin time trial.

COVID-19 measures mean the 184 riders and 460 team staff are entering a protective race and team bubbles with the start finish and team bus areas all part of the race bubble area. However crowds will be allowed along the race route but face masks and distancing are obligatory outdoors in Italy.

World time trial champion Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers) is the overwhelming favourite to take out the opening stage having also won all three Giro time-trials last year while Rémi Cavagna's (Deceuninck-QuickStep) win on stage 5 of the Tour de Romandie has also drawn him into the spotlight.

However Campenaerts also can't be ignored having come second in Milan last year at the final TT and just being beaten by Tom Dumoulin in Jerusalem in 2018.

After joining the warm-up on Zwift riders are also being encouraged to continue on with the Bologna time trial from the 2019 Giro once Campenaerts who starts third at 14:02 CET has started his race against the clock.

”So once the warm-up is complete I know I won't be suffering out there alone. This is part of the Ubuntu spirit in our team so I hope many people will join to encourage me before I start the Giro d'Italia” said Campenaerts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN5Y2xpbmduZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NhbGViLWV3YW4tdGhlLXdpbi1jb3VudC1oYXNudC1iZWVuLWdyZWF0LWJ1dC10aGUtZm9ybS1pcy10aGVyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caleb Ewan: The win count hasn't been great but the form is there,"Caleb Ewan (Lotto Soudal) after his only win of the year so far on stage 7 of the UAE Tour

Caleb Ewan (Lotto Soudal) is heading into the Giro d’Italia buoyed by his form this year – including a show of climbing power on the Poggio at Milan-San Remo – and as a result the sprinter will be looking to hold on longer when the road ascends to capatilize on more opportunities to turn his sprint speed into stage victories.

Ewan has already won three stages at the Giro d’Italia two in 2019 and one in 2017 and this year the race marks the start of his effort to take a stage victory at all three Grand Tours in 2021. The 26-year-old has only had one win so far this year stage 7 of the UAE Tour though even when off the top step has delivered some impressive performances most notably at Milan-San Remo.

“The start of the season hasn’t been great as far as the wins go but my form is really good and I think I showed in San Remo that I was climbing quite good as well so hopefully some of that form can come into the Giro as well and maybe I can get through some of the harder stages” Caleb Ewan told Cycling Pro Net in a pre-race interview.

At Milan-San Remo Ewan won the sprint from the group that was rapidly closing on late-attacker Jasper Stuyven (Trek-Segafredo) to take second place at the first Monument of the season.

That he excelled in the bunch battle was not a surprise but what was a surprise was that he had the climbing strength to track the acceleration of Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) and world champion Julian Alaphilippe (Deceuninck-QuickStep) on the Poggio.

Increased staying power on the climbs may help Ewan make up for what he said was a Giro d’Italia course with less days than normal to suit the sprinter.

“There are still some good chances and there’s a lot of good flat days for the sprints and also some in between days where it could be a sprint or it might be too hard” said Ewan.

Ewan said earlier this week that the first ten days delivered several opportunities and just how he fares in those is likely to determine whether the Lotto Soudal rider reaches Milan. He has started the Giro Rosa three times before but never ridden it through till the end.

Finishing the Giro may not necessarily end up being consistent with his goal of riding and winning a stage at all three Grand Tours. Though if he does decide to hang on for Monte Zoncolan the Dolomites and the grand finale in the Alps he is bound to be all the more grateful for any of that extra climbing strength.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FkZ2V0c2FuZHdlYXJhYmxlcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8wOS9nYXJtaW4tZGVzY2VudC1tazJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin Descent MK2s is a diver's watch for those with smaller wrists,"2 min read

Garmin’s latest wearable is the Descent MK2S. A smaller and less expensive version of the original the diving watch is available in Light Gold Gray and Mineral Blue colorways.

A watch for the deeply curious

The Descent MK is the company’s dive computer range which offers surface GPS navigation. The first generation device was revealed back in 2017 the second generation followed last year. That one comes with a bright 1.4” color display and watch-style design that very much resembles the company’s Fenix 6x. The similarities between MK2 and Fenix 6x however do not stop there.

You’ll find pretty much the same sensors on both including Garmin’s Elevate wrist heart rate technology pulse Ox compass gyroscope barometric altimeter accelerometer and thermometer. The only addition is the depth sensor on the MK2. On surface the watch becomes a training companion offering almost all Fenix 6x multi-sport features advanced performance metrics and smartphone notifications.

Rather conveniently diving mode is automatically activated when you hit the water and switched off when you exit. You get detailed real-time info on depth dive time water temperature ascent/descent rate no-deco time decompression stop information and more. Thanks to the built-in GPS the watch precisely logs where you entered the water and where you exited. The GPS will not work under-water though.

You can even plan your next adventure directly on the device itself. There are a plethora of modes for single and multiple gas dives gauge and apnea.

So far we’ve seen two iterations of the second generation device – the Descent MK2 and Descent MK2i. The main distinguishing factor between them is the fancier build and a few more features on the latter. There’s also a $200 price difference.

Now there’s a third version the watch. The MK2s costs about $300 less than the MK2.

Descent MK2s – what’s new?

The clue is in the name – the letter “s”. No it doesn’t stand for solar – in Garmin’s range the letter denotes a smaller version of the watch.

Essential reading: Best fitness trackers and health gadgets

The current iterations are huge. Measuring 52 x 52 x 17.8 mm they are even bigger than the Fenix 6X. So it makes perfect sense to release something for those with smaller wrists. Smaller dimensions come with a smaller display – a 1.2 inch one.

The MK2S has six dive modes including single and multiple gas dives gauge apnea apnea hunt and closed-circuit rebreather. The hardware is unchanged from the original. It includes ABC sensors an underwater 3-axis compass for orientation below water surface GPS wrist-based heart rate and Pulse Ox multiple sports apps advanced training features Garmin Pay music storage and more.

Battery life is up to 30 hours in dive mode 7 days in smartwatch mode and 6 hours in GPS mode with music. That’s less than half then what you’d get on the full size version – not really surprising as Garmin has had to shrink the size of the battery.

Other watches from the company are expected to follow soon. We expect Garmin Forerunner 945 LTE to land in the near future. Forerunner 55 is another device that is expected soon.

The MK2s can be picked up from Garmin for $999. Check price and availability on Amazon.

The reasons for the rally have not changed; this long-term bull market is fully charged and the expected epic battle for acres is indeed becoming one for the ages.

Brazil's second-season corn crop is in pollination with little relief from the drought across much of the region and their production estimates are declining by the day. Demand that would normally flow to Brazil is quickly shifting to U.S. old crop but supplies here are ultra tight and we don't see evidence that the demand for old-crop delivery is shifting to new crop.

In fact we are seeing a significant surge in new-crop demand while old-crop sales hold tight. Something has to give but it hasn't happened yet. We see little evidence of demand destruction even with corn at nine-year highs and wheat and soybean prices at eight-year highs.

Just for this week Kansas City wheat rallied 34¢ Minneapolis was up 33¢ and Chicago up 25¢. Corn surged 59¢ and soybeans were up 56¢.

The trade is talking about a shift in plantings to more corn than projected in the March Prospective Plantings report. That would explain the sudden emergence of bear spread activity even as prices set new multiyear highs. We see new-crop contracts take leadership in corn and soybeans clearly indicating the desire of both of those markets to bring in more acres.

But where are they going to get them? More corn means less beans and vice-versa. Neither have comfortable enough old-crop stocks to give away acreage. Spring wheat acres are likely the most vulnerable as soybean plantings become more common across the Northern Plains but drought there makes that a difficult decision.

That said there are some rain systems moving across Montana and the Dakotas this weekend that will be a huge boost to topsoil moisture conditions and bring at least some temporary relief to bone-dry soils. The Canadian Prairies are not forecast to get much of that moisture.

Export sales for wheat last week were a disappointing 303 TMT with 96 TMT net cancelled from old crop and 399 TMT sold of new crop. Sales have slowed considerably the last few weeks. Even though all world FOB offers have risen sharply U.S. FOB offers are well above competing world offers. Year-to-date U.S. sales total 25.7 MMT down 2% from last year. That contrasts with the first half of the marketing year when sales were well ahead of the previous year.

Soybean sales have slowed as well with Brazil's crop taking the lead. U.S. soybean sales last week were 358 TMT. Still U.S. soybean sales stand well ahead of last year at 61.2 MMT up 55% over last year. Corn sales too have slowed recently with last week at 243 TMT. Year-to-date sales are still way ahead of last year at 67.8 MMT year-to-date up 81% over last year.

In other news Russian farmers are reportedly planting more spring wheat acres mostly on ground that had winterkill on their winter wheat in the central and Volga regions. Russian doesn't normally export spring wheat and yields would be less than winter wheat but it would help shore up total wheat supplies.

Looking ahead until we see corn prices peak it is unlikely that wheat prices will peak. That said with winter wheat harvest starting in just a few weeks here in the U.S. wheat is the most vulnerable to price declines. Corn and beans will likely hold strong until we get past our own pollination and that is still more than two months away.

Demand for feed grains is massive and wheat is being pulled into feed channels across the globe. All grain stocks are in very tight supply and it is unlikely that one year will fix that problem. The market needs at least trendline yields this year just to keep pipeline supplies. Any hint of weather problems in a major producing region sends grain prices sharply higher yet again.

At this point winter wheat in the Central Plains looks OK and recent rains should shore up production. Northern Plains is still early but drought conditions are well entrenched and rains will need to be timely. Except for the key state of Iowa the Midwest has plenty of moisture so at this point a weather market is not the focus – it is really about acres at this point.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaXNiYW5ldGltZXMuY29tLmF1L3Nwb3J0L2NydWVsLWdhbWUtZm9ybWVyLWd5bW5hc3RzLW9wZW4tdXAtb24tY3VsdHVyZS1vZi1mZWFyLWFuZC1jb250cm9sLTIwMjEwNTA3LXA1N3B0MC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruel game: Former gymnasts open up on culture of fear and control,"Save Log in  register or subscribe to save articles for later.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Georgia Simpson knew with sickening certainty as she was twisting and tumbling through the air that it was going to end badly. A part of her knew it before she even walked on the mat to start her routine. The moment she crash-landed she instinctively did what every gymnast is taught to do; get back up. But as she regained her feet something felt all wrong. She looked down and saw why. Her left foot was jutting out sideways at a horrific angle from her shin. The inside of her ankle was a mess of broken skin blood and protruding bone. The crowd who’d come to watch some of the world’s best gymnasts saw it too. Some looked away. If only they had witnessed what took place a short time before. Simpson an Olympic aspirant just months out from the London Games told her team physio before her floor routine she was in a lot of pain. Her other foot her right one was bruised and swollen from what she later discovered was an undiagnosed stress fracture. She didn’t think she could do it. She doesn’t know what conversations were had between the physio her coaches and national coach Peggy Liddick only that the decision was made for her. “I was advised that other girls have it worse and I should toughen up” she says. It was the last time she ever competed. Serious injuries are part of gymnastics. Yet with the benefit of time away from the sport Simpson knows the injury which ended her career should never have happened. She doesn’t blame the physio or her coaches; she blames a sporting culture in which child athletes have no power to speak against what they are asked to do.

“I held it inside for a long time” says Simpson now back in Perth after spending four years overseas. “I was 17 and I needed to move on. But I look back now and that should have been cause for investigation. Former gymnast Georgia Simpson sustained a horrific injury after trying to tell Australian team officials she was not fit to compete. Credit: Tony McDonough “I’m the one who is jumping I’m the one who is flipping through the air. Shouldn’t I have a voice and be able to say what I do and don’t believe my body is capable of doing? “Our voices weren’t valued in that way. They had complete control over whether our body was fit to do something or not.” Gymnasts are finding their voices now. A Human Rights Commission report commissioned by the sport’s governing body Gymnastics Australia identified systemic issues of misconduct bullying abuse harassment and assault the acceptance of negative and abusive coaching and a “culture of fear and control” instilled by coaches over their athletes.

It is not a rap sheet of rogue practices in the sport but an examination of its norms. The report was not limited to women’s gymnastics but it is here where the athletes are younger and the power imbalance between athletes and coaches greater that the culture and practices are potentially so damaging. The Australian gymnastics scandal is not about predatory monsters like Larry Nassar the US national team doctor at the centre of the Athlete A documentary which exposed the sinister side of gymnastics in America. It is not about evil sadistic coaches. It is about something more insidious accepted and rationalised. ‘I’m the one who is jumping I’m the one who is flipping through the air. Shouldn’t I have a voice and be able to say what I do and don’t believe my body is capable of doing?’ Former gymnast Georgia Simpson Put simply Australian gymnastics for the past 30 years has accepted fear punitive training ostracisation and a reckless attitude towards injuries as legitimate methods to turn children into Olympic athletes. Julia Murcia a former gymnast who since the broadcast of Athlete A last year has been working with other gymnasts who trained at the now disbanded high-performance program at the West Australian Institute of Sport to bring to light the abusive culture they experienced says part of the problem is the sport’s myopic focus on the Olympics as the only measure of success. Ann-Maree Vallence another former gymnast says it is all about control. To understand this you need only read a letter to a young gymnast written by Liddick the national coach of women’s gymnastics for 20 years and one of the most influential figures in Australian gymnastics.

Liddick a highly credentialed coach who had previously worked with the world-beating US Olympic team wrote a letter in November 2002 to Sarah Lauren a 15-year-old gymnast who quit the sport just as Liddick had pencilled her into her next Olympic team. The letter was posted to Lauren’s family home in Perth. Her mother Margaret-Anne remembers the day she came home from work to find her daughter on the floor sobbing after having just read it. “She handed me the letter. I was furious.” Liddick’s fury is clear enough from the typed pages. She began by saying she wasn’t going to try to talk Lauren out of her decision. She then castigated and shamed her for making a decision without consulting her that she believed wasn’t hers to make on her own. Lauren had returned home from winning two gold medals at the Commonwealth Games in Manchester. Liddick wrote she was fooling herself if she thought she had achieved anything in gymnastics. Liddick did not accept that having made it onto the national team Lauren was entitled to quit the sport two years before the Athens Games. “It is not only YOUR decision to make” she wrote. “I cannot produce a successful team with only one or two gymnasts.

“I know at 15 years old you want an opinion about your future this is normal. You must take the advice of the experienced people around you being an Olympian will open so many doors for you later on when searching for your career path. No academic record cannot (sic) replace having that ‘Olympian’ on your resume.” What Liddick didn’t understand is that going to the Olympics was not Lauren’s dream. She felt proud to have gone to the Commonwealth Games but after competing in Manchester with cortisone injections in an injured ankle and undergoing another round of surgery she’d had enough. Former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar was jailed for life for sexually abusing athletes in his care. Credit: AP “The difference between myself and others around me at that time is everyone’s identity was wrapped up in gymnastics and mine wasn’t” Lauren explains. “I knew there was a life outside of gymnastics. I wanted to be educated I wanted to be able to have a career. “When you look at the language in that letter you are almost a possession to them; a chess piece they can do what they want with to get the end result.” Lauren says she never regretted her decision. She studied commerce at the University of Western Australia and now runs her own finance and accounting business and is raising a family. Peggy Liddick declined to respond to questions from The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald.

That's not all either. On the same day the game will also be added to the PC version of Xbox Game Pass - up until now it's only been available in the console Game Pass library - with cross-play support for Xbox One Xbox Series X/S and Windows 10 players too.

Cross-play with PlayStation players however is seemingly still unsupported.

""Now is the best time to jump into Remnant - a third-person survival action shooter set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by monstrous creatures"" teases the developer. ""As one of the last remnants of humanity you'll set out alone or alongside up to two other players to face down hordes of deadly enemies and epic bosses and try to carve a foothold rebuild and then retake what was lost.""

THQ Nordic announced Remnant: From the Ashes prequel Chronos: Before the Ashes last September. Also from Gunfire Games the same studio behind Remnant: From the Ashes and Darksiders 3 the game sees you play a young hero who tries to save his home from an ancient evil. It's set in a labyrinth with ""unforgiving and brutal"" combat.

As Wes explained at the time there's an interesting ageing mechanic: when you die you have to wait a year to return to the labyrinth which means you can try again but one year older.

But to make this real it'll have to find manufacturing partners to bring the tech to market.

The new manufacturing technology featuring components called nanosheets increases chip performance 45% or reduces power consumption by 75% compared with the one used to make IBM server chips or Apple's iPhone chips IBM said Thursday. The company expects the technology to arrive in processors in 2024 or 2025 two generations beyond the most advanced processes currently used by today's manufacturing leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing or TSMC.

The same basic chipmaking technology that's been used for decades underlies IBM's approach: a carefully arranged pattern of light beamed onto silicon wafers to etch patterns that become the data-processing circuitry elements called transistors. Continuous refinements have let chipmakers gradually shrink those transistors so that processors once used in room-size mainframes can now power a smartwatch.

The new method uses two structures. The first are nanosheets the thin flat wires that carry electrical current across the transistor. Second is a new design for the gate the transistor component that switches that current on or off. IBM uses gate-all-around technology that completely surrounds each nanosheet with the gate material to keep electrical current from leaking.

""We have the transistor device to make it happen and we are seeing the performance improvements"" said Dario Gil head of IBM Research which licenses its chip technology for manufacturers to use. ""The entire industry is going to use this transistor technology.""

Chip progress is important. Cutting power usage is critical for battery-limited mobile devices as well as improving performance makes apps faster and more powerful. Shrinking transistors means more circuitry for faster graphics AI processing and other dedicated hardware abilities.

2nm manufacturing process

The company on Thursday showed off silicon wafers studded with rectangular chips using the new approach. IBM Research is building the test chips at its semiconductor research facility in Albany New York a choice that will likely sit well with politicians eager to restore US chipmaking prowess.

Chipmakers refer to their manufacturing processes by the super-small dimension of nanometers a billionth of a meter. A strand of DNA for example is 2nm wide. For chipmaking a smaller nanometer number indicates progress in miniaturization though the terms used today are largely labels rather than actual measurements.

Today's most advanced manufacturing is TSMC's 5-nanometer process. Much of the industry still uses 7nm or earlier processes. Next in line is 3nm. IBM labels its new process as 2nm. Each step on this path is called a manufacturing node.

Since we're running out of nanometers it isn't clear what labels will come next especially since the numbers are no longer true measurements.

Gil suggested that perhaps we'll switch to angstroms -- a unit of measurement that's one tenth of a nanometer. But he laughs about the idea since the label now is divorced from true measurements.

""The number of the node ceased having meaning since 65nm"" Gil said. ""Ever since then all it really means is the name of the next node two years later.""

Other chipmakers already working on gate-all-around

What isn't clear is how the technology will come to market since IBM no longer makes its own processors.

With a stack of tiny flat wires called nanosheets IBM Research promises chips with faster smaller components that use less power. IBM Research

The world's three major chipmakers -- Intel TSMC and Samsung -- all have their own research programs and likely already are working on gate-all-around technology said David Kanter principal analyst at Real World Insights. ""Every major player clearly has plans for this.""

Samsung showed off its gate-all-around technology at a February conference and Intel like IBM is working on stacking multiple layers of nanosheets into each transistor.

IBM has partnerships with major chipmakers though. Samsung builds IBM server processors and an IBM research alliance is part of new Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's plan to turn around Intel's years of problems.

Another complication for IBM will be proving its technology works outside of a lab in high-volume manufacturing where costs and consistency are crucial.

""For semiconductor manufacturing simply doing the R&D and proving it out is quite a bit different than proving that it scales"" Kanter said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3Jldmlldy1jYW1lcm9uLWRpc2NvdmVycy10aGUtdHJ1dGgtYWJvdXQtZnJhbmNvcy1kZWF0aC1vbi1nZW5lcmFsLWhvc3BpdGFsL2FydGljbGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Cameron discovers the truth about Franco's death on 'General Hospital',"William Lipton as Cameron Webber in 'General Hospital.' Photo Courtesy of ABC

This past week Cameron Webber (William Lipton) finally learned the truth about who really shot Franco (Roger Howarth) in the ABC soap opera “General Hospital.” Digital Journal has the recap.

Cameron noted that he overheard his onscreen mother Elizabeth (Rebecca Herbst) saying that Jason Morgan (Steve Burton) did not kill Franco Baldwin.

Scotty Baldwin (Kin Shriner) Franco’s father confirmed the news to Cameron and revealed that Peter August (Wes Ramsey) is very likely Franco’s murderer. While Elizabeth and Scotty do not have the proof that Peter killed Franco they know that it’s true since everything points directly to him.

William Lipton delivers a powerhouse and bold acting performance where his reactions at that moment are spot-on moving and relatable. Lipton has been killing it each week throughout the entire year on General Hospital where it’s with his music (singing songs on the show) or with his compelling acting. He manages to layer his emotions well and that resonates with the audience and fans.

Cameron comes to a startling realization that all the times he fought with Josslyn (Eden McCoy) and Jake (Hudson West) about Jason he was indeed wrong. As a result he feels terrible and guilty about his actions and runs to his room. Kudos once again to William Lipton for a job well done.

Tune in this week on ABC’s General Hospital to see how this storyline will unfold.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGVib29rY2hlY2submV0L0xlbm92by1UaGlua1BhZC1UMTQtR2VuLTItbGFwdG9wLXJldmlldy1GYW1pbGlhci1iZW5lZml0cy1mcm9tLUludGVsLVRpZ2VyLUxha2UuNTM3NDg2LjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 2 laptop review: Familiar benefits from Intel Tiger Lake,"In Lenovo's current ThinkPad lineup the T-series without the ""s"" suffix is like a rock: the ThinkPad T14 and ThinkPad T15 the mainstream business laptops for large corporate customers have used the same design since 2019.

Investors should take note when an analyst becomes bullish on a stock after standing on the sidelines. It could signal the name is undervalued and poised for long-term growth. The stocks highlighted below have just been upgraded to Buy. As for the analysts handing out these upgrades they boast a proven track record of success. TipRanks' analyst forecasting service works to identify the best-performing analysts on Wall Street or the analysts with the highest success rate and average return per rating. These metrics factor in the number of ratings published by each analyst. Here are five stocks that were recently upgraded by Wall Street's best-performing analysts:

ON Semiconductor

Based on operating margin catalysts as well as its valuation ON Semiconductor just scored an upgrade from Baird analyst Tristan Gerra. Now rating the stock a Buy the top analyst also increased the price target from $38 to $48 (29% upside potential). While management guided for revenue that is less than the seasonal norm Gerra remains unfazed. Expounding on this the analyst stated ""The company's aggressive inventory shift… along with a very significant rebound in utilization rates enabled them to gain share in 2Q by outshipping competitors in our view. We do not view management's preliminary 3Q below-seasonal revenue outlook as the sign of a coming downcycle but rather a capacity limitation with the potential for the company to exceed second-half expectations on better supply availability."" On top of this the semiconductor company has been working to improve its mix. These efforts will be bolstered thanks to the current ""tight supply environment"" in Gerra's opinion rather than if ON was operating in an over-supply environment. All of this prompted the analyst to note ""Investors for the medium-term should be rewarded with significant upside both from an ongoing upcycle and likely the most significant turnaround in the company's history. Cost initiatives mix and pricing should catalyze further gross margin expansion in both 2H and 2022 as product repositioning initiatives gain momentum."" Gerra is currently tracking a 62% success rate and 20.4% average return per rating according to recent data provided by TipRanks.

Shopify

In a research report entitled ""The Retail 'Shift' Appears Here to Stay"" Roth Capital analyst Darren Aftahi makes the case for e-commerce name Shopify. In addition to upgrading the stock to Buy he also set a $1530 price target suggesting 37% upside potential. Looking at the company's 1Q results the numbers ""once again"" beat Aftahi's raised and above consensus expectations ""as growth accelerated across all key segments and metrics."" Total revenue growth reached 110% and total gross merchandise value or GMV came in at $37.3 billion reflecting 114% year-over-year growth and besting the analyst's call by 11%. According to management the strong result was driven by growing traction and integration across social media platforms as well as additional international expansion. International GMV growth exceeded that of North America which implies ""SHOP's growth was more than just a U.S. stimulus check dynamic"" in Aftahi's opinion. ""While SHOP may not be able to outgrow its upcoming ~90%+ topline growth rates it appears clear the company is continuing to gain market share and grow on the outskirts of the pandemic… International expansion acts as one of the major upside catalysts for SHOP where it will begin to invest more directly and its portfolio of merchant solutions internationally has barely scratched the surface beyond payments"" Aftahi commented. With this in mind the analyst bumped up his forecast for FY21 revenue by roughly 3%. ""When we look at multiple catalysts through international expansion and organic plan upgrades to Plus alongside commentary April GMV has been on-par with 1Q trends we see growth remaining quite healthy for this best-in-class e-commerce/tech name"" Aftahi said. Landing among the top 66 analysts tracked by TipRanks Aftahi boasts an impressive 44.5% average return per rating.

Cogent Communications

Following its 1Q21 earnings release Oppenheimer's Timothy Horan sees Cogent Communications as a compelling play within the internet ethernet and colocation services space. As such the five-star analyst upgraded the stock from Hold to Buy. In addition he put a $90 price target on CCOI which brings the upside potential to 16%. In the first quarter the company posted total revenue of $146.8 million which reflected a slight beat. In addition gross margin was up by 200 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter. Looking ahead management gave long-term multi-year targets of 10% annualized revenue growth and 200 basis points of annual adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. As a result post-earnings Horan is ""incrementally more positive on growth."" When it comes to the netcentric business it has bounced back to growth thanks to international expansion and retreating customers. What's more according to the Oppenheimer analyst corporate customers have been forced to close branch offices due to the pandemic. However after peaking in the middle of the fourth quarter churn has seen a significant improvement with corporate purchasing activity (DIA) also getting a boost. To this end the analyst estimates corporate revenues will gain 2% to 3% quarter-over-quarter when stabilized. It should also be noted that this stock trades at a 3.6% free cash flow yield which is ""attractive"" in Horan's opinion for a name ""growing free cash flow in the mid-20% range over the next two years."" The company is also making an effort to cut costs and increase unit growth ""supported by its low-cost positioning."" Summing it all up Horan stated ""Fundamentals are improving as we exit the pandemic and CCOI trades at an attractive valuation which has created a buying opportunity. Long-term we think the company is positioned to take share in both corporate (~20% market share today) and netcentric (~25% market share today) as the low-cost provider of internet services in a commoditized market."" Supporting his position on TipRanks' ranking of best-performing analysts Horan has achieved a 67% success rate and 17.5% average return per rating.

Cirrus Logic

Cirrus Logic 's high valuation and concentration of revenues from Apple had previously kept Needham's Rajvindra Gill on the sidelines. That said given that shares have taken a major fall since the middle of January and its price-earnings multiple has compressed 40% the analyst has reconsidered his stance. On May 4 Gill upgraded the fabless semiconductor supplier from Hold to Buy and put a $100 price target on the stock. This target suggests that shares could gain 31% in the year ahead. Although Gill acknowledges that the recent earnings results and guidance were ""disappointing"" he points out that ""the numbers were attributed to revenue recognition timing where the company is selling camera controllers for use in camera modules where lead times are shorter than the rest of components and thus are shipped earlier."" Further explaining his bullish thesis Gill noted ""New opportunities are emerging including potential content gains at Apple with a new Power IC (with a $1 ASP). Net we expect revenue growth to accelerate in FY22 and believe stock is compelling here."" Looking at the analyst's current iPhone dollar content estimates they land at about $4.20 ($5.20 with an additional $1 ASP for the Power IC). This is set to be integrated into iPhones in Fall 2021. Additionally CRUS is working to expand beyond the audio domain with its high-performance mixed-signal chips. According to Gill the ""22nm chips could translate to either more digital processing closer to the analog or a radically smaller or more power efficient chip."" What's more the company is making a significant effort to grab market share with Android-based phones with haptic controllers. It's also growing the smart codec portfolio working to deliver size and power improvements. A top analyst covering names in the tech sector Gill's calls on average generate returns of 15.5% with his success rate clocking in at 67%.

The ship is named in honor of Marine Corps Vietnam veteran and Medal of Honor recipient Lance Cpl. Miguel Keith and is the first ship to bear the name.

“This ship is named after an inspiring leader – a Marine. Lt. Gen. Heckl ran through Miguel’s career and a more detailed action of that day. But can any of us truly imagine? Close your eyes for a minute and try to think. The sound of gunfire like the worst violent storm any of us have ever been through. The searing heat suffocating humidity the chaos and confusion of battle. The smell of death and destruction. When many would have stepped back Miguel stepped up. He led the charge courageously focused on his team above all else and he made a difference. A difference that is continued today.”



Adm. Craig S. Faller Commander U.S. Southern Command

ESB 5 was involved in an incident during its build: The yard’s graving dock flooded in July 2018. The ship was knocked off its blocks and took on water.

ESB class ships are highly flexible modular platforms optimized to support a variety of maritime-based missions including Special Operations Forces and Airborne Mine Counter Measures support operations in addition to humanitarian support and sustainment of traditional military missions.

Built by General Dynamics NASSCO the Montford Point-class is comprised of five ships across two variants: expeditionary transfer dock and expeditionary sea base. USNS Montford Point (T-ESD 1) USNS John Glenn (T-ESD 2) USS Lewis B. Puller (ESB 3) and USS Hershel “Woody” Williams (ESB 4) have been delivered to the fleet. Miguel Keith is the third platform of the ESB variant.

At 18 Marine Lance Cpl. Miguel Keith fought off the enemy in Vietnam despite being wounded twice. Fifty-one years later a U.S. Navy ship was commissioned in his honor Saturday — recognizing Keith for his bravery and love of his fellow servicemen.

“We will fight and win with the warrior spirit that would make Lance Cpl. Miguel Keith proud” said Capt. Troy Fendrick commanding officer of the ship delivered to the Navy on Nov. 15 2019.

“I consider it the privilege of my lifetime to command this ship in honor of your son” the captain told Keith’s mother who watched the ceremony online.

“He remains a hero to all who have served and his fighting spirit will forever be a part of this ship and to all those who sail her” Fendrick said in front of a small crowd at North Island Naval Air Station.

The ceremony included a 19-gun salute as well as tributes to Keith and his family and speeches by military leaders.

With the motto “Always in the Fight” the 785-foot Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB 5) can function as a floating base.

It is one of three types of the Expeditionary Transfer Dock platform providing logistics movement from sea to shore supporting a broad range of military operations according to the Navy. The ESB variant is designed around four core capabilities: aviation berthing equipment staging area and command and control.

USS Miguel Keith will be part of the Forward Deployed Naval Force operating from Saipan.

Built in San Diego by NASSCO for $525 million The ship has 101 military members and 44 Military Sealift Command personnel.

U.S. Rep. Scott Peters of San Diego spoke at the one-hour ceremony pointing out Keith’s courage in battle. Sen. Dianne Feinstein spoke via the internet.

A group of family members including two of Keith’s brothers also attended the commissioning.

Keith was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism in Vietnam for actions almost exactly one year after enlisting in the Marine Corps and one month after being promoted to lance corporal.

His Medal on Honor citation reads in part: “For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a machine gunner.”

Keith fired his gun as he advanced through a hailstorm of bullets against a greatly outnumbering enemy force after being shot and then injured by a grenade attack in Quảng Ngãi Province.

Keith was born in San Antonio Texas and enlisted in the Marines in 1969 training at Camp Pendleton.

The ship — whose keel was laid Jan. 30 2018 — was damaged while under construction when the General Dynamics National Steel and Shipbuilding Company dry dock was accidentally flooded July 11 2018

At the commissioning Adm. Craig S. Faller spoke of the danger facing the ship’s crew.

China this nation’s long-term threat “wants to impose its version of international order” said Faller commander of the U.S. Southern Command. “To continue winning this global competition we must be at the top of our game.”

“We’ve got to keep developing the best technology the best ships like you see here today. I’m confident we will” he said.

Faller had advice for the crew: One — never give up. Two — never doubt your ability to get the mission done. And third — be of service to something bigger than yourself.

Faller said he spoke to Keith’s mother who said love is the quality that best symbolizes her son. Faller then quoted the Bible saying there is no greater love than to lay down your life for others.

“This ship embodies his spirit” the admiral said. “This crew will carry that spirit forward.”

The Navy plans to procure two more Expeditionary Sea Bases — the USS John L. Canley and the USS Robert E. Simanek.

One of the light tank prototypes for U.S. Army infantry brigade combat teams was spotted at the company’s facility in Michigan.

The new combat vehicle developed as part of the Army’s future mobile protected firepower (MPF) is a protected platform capable of delivering overwhelming precisionﬁrepower combined with the ability to move rapidly in a variety of terrain conditions.

These images shared by Kristo Karl on its Twitter account divulge new details about the designs of BAE’s MPF prototype.

The new light tank equipped with 105mm cannon and an auto-loading ammunition system that allows the gun to fire at a rate of 12 rounds per minute. It is also fitted with heavy and medium machine guns.

According to open sources the new combat vehicle integrates scalable armor and innovative survivability subsystems to protect the vehicle and crew from threats on the future battlefield. The metal bolt-on armor system provides field repairable or replacement.

The MPF solution is an integration of existing mature technologies and components that avoids development which would lengthen the program schedule.

In addition last month BAE Systems has delivered its first prototype of the Mobile Protected Firepower light tank to the Army at Aberdeen Proving Ground.

The Inside Defense has reported that the new light tank will be used in the Army’s soldier vehicle assessment at Ft. Bragg NC which began in January. The service will use the assessment to choose between prototypes from BAE and General Dynamics Land Systems.

The ship named in honor of Marine Corps Vietnam veteran and Medal of Honor recipient Lance Cpl. Miguel Keith was built in San Diego by General Dynamics NASSCO and was delivered to the Navy on Nov. 15 2019.

USS Miguel Keith is the third ESB in the Montford Point-class of ships that is comprised of five ships across two variants two expeditionary transfer docks and three expeditionary sea bases. The ESB were initially envisioned as support ships bearing the USNS designation and having a mixed civilian and US Navy crew. The navy changed its mind in 2017 when it commissioned USS Lewis B. Puller (formerly USNS Lewis B. Puller) in order to be able to conduct military operations directly from the ship in line with international laws of armed conflict.

Under the law of armed conflict missions such as special operations staging and mine-countermeasure operations must be conducted by a warship.

These vessels are highly flexible platforms that provide logistics movement from sea to shore supporting a broad range of military operations. The ESB is designed around four core capabilities: aviation facilities berthing equipment staging area and command and control.

ESB ships have an aviation hangar and a flight deck that includes four operating spots capable of landing V-22 and MH-53E equivalent helicopters accommodations work spaces and ordnance storage for an embarked force.

Global packaged goods companies sustained solid growth during the first quarter of 2021 rising 4.5% organically. Like other companies in other industries all of them are facing input cost inflation to a meaningful degree and are likely to raise prices for consumers. But as the CEO of Kellogg’s reminded everyone on their earnings call this week marketers can earn price increases by building stronger brands.

Television advertising has been one of the most important vehicles used to build brands; however change is occurring rapidly as illustrated by this week’s results from Roku and other data related to declining conventional pay-TV subscriptions. Whatever vehicles marketers choose to use what matters is that they continue to invest in their brands to better position themselves to earn the price increases they will increasingly need.

—–

Virtually all packaged goods companies have now reported their first quarter 2021 results and input cost inflation remains a key trend. Costs will inevitably be passed along to consumers as the year progresses. Addressing how to deal with this phenomenon on its earnings call this week Kellogg’s CEO said “we have to earn that price in the marketplace through investing in our brands (and) through innovating.” It may seem paradoxical to suggest incurring more cost in order to offset other costs and yet it certainly can work. In an article from Kantar published last year titled “Why pricing power is a brand’s greatest asset” they stated “to justify paying more for a brand people must feel that they are getting something from buying that brand that they cannot get elsewhere. In other words they have to perceive it as different in some way…Brands that command a higher price point in their category are typically seen as meaningful and different.” While the primary drivers of growth for advertising this year and beyond are smaller businesses app developers and others who will not have particularly strong brands in the conventional sense for larger traditional marketers to invest more heavily in their brands to justify the higher prices they plan to seek would be a source of upside growth for the media industry.

In addition to Kellogg’s we have compiled results from the largest publicly listed packaged goods segments at Nestle P&G Unilever Pepsico Coca-Cola L’Oreal Mondelez Kraft Heinz Danone Reckitt Colgate General Mills Kimberly-Clark J&J Henkel Hershey and Clorox. On a combined basis this group of global packaged goods companies grew 4.5% on an organic basis during the first quarter of 2021. This followed on what was a relatively strong 2020 all things considered of 3.6% organic growth. The growth rate was also notable as the sector faced relatively difficult comparables against the early phases of the pandemic last year which led to a similar 4.6% growth rate in 1Q20). North American growth was only slightly softer vs. other markets but then the year-ago period was slightly stronger in North America vs. the rest of the world last year. On a two-year basis growth rates were similar.

Looking at individual groups of business segments by their core products food businesses grew organically by 5.2% in 1Q21 ahead of the 4.0% growth rate posted in each of the full year 2020 and 1Q20. Beverages were still relatively soft and were close to flat similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter but well ahead of the year’s average. Out-of-home consumption serves as a significant drag for these companies. Petcare was up 8.9% sustaining the rapid growth we have seen for an extended period of time (above mid-single digits since the beginning of 2019). Personal care businesses were also relatively soft growing by 1.1% or below the pace of growth observed in the fourth quarter and full-year 2020 levels both because of pantry loading during the first quarter of 2020 but also because consumers are still not consuming all personal care products as they used to. Despite similar pantry loading trends for home care products growth is still elevated at high single-digit levels with a gain of 8.0% on our calculations.

Unsurprisingly e-commerce continues to grow rapidly: a subset of companies among this group that disclosed e-commerce growth or share of revenue attributable to e-commerce indicates that growth was around 48% in the first quarter only slightly slower than full-year 2020’s 55% pace of expansion. E-commerce now accounts for around 14% of total revenue up from 10% in the year-ago quarter and 8% in the calendar year 2019. Of course some segments remain relatively less dependent than others as food-centric marketers generally have been able to rely on retailers staying open over the course of the past years while others whose goods primarily sold through “non-essential” channels were more dependent on investing in direct-to-consumer or other e-commerce based sales channels.

The week was also punctuated by reporting from Roku which posted its results for the quarter as well. Roku’s results showed 35% more active accounts and 49% more time spent on the platform which in total resulted in 18.3 billion hours of streaming content (vs. 12.3 billion in the year-ago quarter). Per account we can calculate a 9% increase in streaming hours year-over-year.

For reference total TV consumption in the US amounted to 102 billion household viewing hours in the most recent quarter with 22.4 billion hours originating from internet-connected devices according to Nielsen. Year-over-year household growth in internet-connected device-based consumption amounted to 15% because of the very difficult comparable with last year’s first quarter.

We are mindful that Roku has a relatively small but growing international presence which will account for a share of the 18.3 billion hours. The company claims that now more than one in three smart TVs sold in Canada feature Roku and that it has the #2 operating system for Smart TVs sold in Mexico. =

Growth in Roku accounts coincides with (and probably partially contributes to) the decline in pay-TV subscriptions as well. On our calculations during the first quarter of 2021 traditional satellite and cable services and incremental vMVPD (virtual MVPDs or internet-based pay-TV distributors) households tracked by Nielsen declined by approximately 4% on a combined basis during this period. This compares with a decline that ran below 4% in each quarter of 2020. In total Nielsen estimates that there are now 87 million households or 72% of the country’s total with pay-TV services now. 12% of total households (a subset of the 72% figure) are solely served by vMVPDs well below the historic peaks exceeding 90% as recently as 2013. Similar trends are occurring in many other markets around the world albeit from lower levels of peak pay-TV penetration: this past week Liberty Global also reported results and while pay-TV is growing in some newer markets such as Poland it is declining in other more valuable ones such as the UK where Roku among others are investing for their future growth.

All of these overlapping trends contribute to the increased availability of addressable and connected TV inventory but also to the increased scarcity of traditional linear television inventory. Inflationary conditions for like-for-like units of inventory inevitably will follow. Fortunately for marketers and media owners television remains a medium that is a key contributor to brand-building efforts although its ongoing erosion means that marketers need to continually invest in finding ways to build their brands without relying as much on television in the future as they did in the past. Whatever vehicles marketers choose to use what matters is that they continue to invest in their brands so that they can be better positioned to earn the prices they plan to seek from consumers in the years ahead.

As Cadillac ventures into an age of electric vehicles the designs of its models are also set for a radical shift and this concept imagines how a future Caddy might look like.

This concept was penned by GM designer Zhou Fang and shared on social media by the car manufacturer. It doesn’t preview a new model that Cadillac is developing which given its futuristic shape is understandable but still makes for an interesting design exercise.

The vehicle has been presented as a low-slung two-door with four seats. As is so typical of concept cars the Cadillac coupe is rocking a set of absolutely gigantic wheels while the front end is dominated by thin and tall LEDs. The shape of the front is also very pointed while the implementation of an electric powertrain has allowed Fang to stretch the windshield forward and in line with the front axle.

The sides are ultra-sleek and free of door handles while the small rear-facing cameras that are used instead of traditional wing mirrors are positioned high on the side windows. Another interesting detail are the sharp fins on the roof. Completing the design is a virtually non-existent rear overhang and LED taillights.

Although Cadillac won’t bring this concept into production it is readying the release of a bold new electric vehicle dubbed the Celestiq. This model will act as a flagship sedan and will join the Lyriq in Cadillac’s EV range.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb2NrcG9ydGpvdXJuYWwuY29tL25ld3MvbGlmZXN0eWxlcy9uaWFnYXJhLWRpc2NvdmVyaWVzLWpvaG4tai1yYXNrb2ItZnJvbS1sb2NrcG9ydC1uZXdzYm95LXRvLWR1cG9udC0tLWdtLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS9hcnRpY2xlX2EyYjNkNzA2LWFkM2ItMTFlYi04OGQ4LWQzYzY0YTQyYjBiNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NIAGARA DISCOVERIES: John J.

Now after GM South America confirmed the project earlier this year as part of its production plans for the 2020-2024 calendar years in Brazil new details have just emerged about the compact unibody pickup that the company is preparing.

The upcoming small Chevy pickup will be an all-new model that will indirectly replace the Chevrolet Montana that has been sold for more than a decade in Latin American markets where it’s also known as the Chevy Tornado. In addition to confirming that the vehicle will ride on the GEM platform sources familiar with the matter have revealed that the pickup will share many elements with the new Chevrolet Tracker subcompact crossover while also having an aesthetic identity of its own.

According to Brazil’s Autos Segredos the next-gen compact Chevy pickup will be launched in mid-2022 in Brazil where it will compete in the growing category of unibody pickups currently dominated by FCA Stellantis and its Fiat Strada and Fiat Toro models. The source claims that the new model will have a four-door cabin as its only available configuration. A single cab option is not planned at least initially.

Those who claim to have seen the vehicle say that aesthetically speaking the new compact Chevy pickup will have a front design inspired by the new Chevrolet Trailblazer much like GM Authority presented last year in our exclusive renderings. In fact the new model will utilize a split headlight setup with the slim LED daytime running lights (DRLs) on top followed by the primary headlights lower within the front end.

On a mechanical level GM’s next unibody pickup is expected to use the same powertrain as the range-topping version of the fourth-gen Chevrolet Tracker but with higher power output and a more robust configuration to enable a healthy payload rating. The engine in question is the 1.2L I-3 turbocharged engine which in the pickup will offer more than the current 133 horsepower it generates in the subcompact Tracker.

The next-gen compact Chevy pickup will be ready during the first half of the 2022 calendar year for the Brazilian market where it will strengthen the Bow Tie brand’s product portfolio in the face of intensifying competition for local sales leadership. The vehicle is also expected to be offered in Mexico along with most markets in Central and South America. As of this writing an introduction in the U.S. or Canada is not expected.

As for its name the aforementioned publication also reports that the new compact pickup will retain the Chevrolet Montana nameplate.

AXA among Europe’s top five insurers said it was suspending the option in response to concerns aired by French justice and cybersecurity officials during a Senate roundtable in Paris last month about the devastating global epidemic of ransomware.

“The word to get out today is that regarding ransomware we don’t pay and we won’t pay” cybercrime prosecutor Johanna Brousse said at the hearing. Only the U.S. surpassed France last year in damage from ransomware to businesses hospitals schools and local governments according to the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft estimating France’s related overall losses at more than $5.5 billion.

The suspension only applies to France and does not affect existing policies said Christine Weirsky a spokeswoman for the U.S. AXA subsidiary a leading underwriter of cyber-insurance in the United States. She said it also does not affect coverage for responding and recovering from ransomware attacks in which criminals based in safe havens including Russia break into networks seed malware and cripple them by scrambling data.

Only after ransoms are paid do the criminals provide software keys to decode the data. And last year many began stealing sensitive data before encrypting networks and threatening to dump it online unless victims paid up. That helped drive ransom payments up nearly threefold to an average of more than $300000. The average recover time from a ransomware attack is three weeks.

The insurance industry has come under considerable criticism for reimbursing ransom payments. Cybersecurity expert Josephine Wolff of Tufts University said it has come to be built into organizations’ risk-management practices “as one of the costs of doing business. And I think that’s really worrisome because that is what fuels the continued ransomware business – people keep paying ransom.”

An 81-page urgent action plan delivered to the White House last week by a public-private task force noted that enriching ransomware criminals only fuels more global crime including terrorism. But the authors stopped short of advocating a ban on ransom payments saying paying up can sometimes be the only way for an afflicted business to avoid bankruptcy. U.S. officials call ransomware a national security threat and some lawmakers are calling for immediate financial relief for stricken local authorities short on IT resources and running vulnerable systems.

Often ransomware criminals have gathered intelligence about potential targets in advance and know when a victim carries insurance that covers ransom payments. Sometimes they even know a policy’s payment ceiling.

Emsisoft analyst Brett Callow called AXA’s decision smart noting that some organizations seem more inclined to pay ransom if the money isn’t coming from their own pockets. “The only way to break this vicious cycle is to cut off the flow of cash _ and ceasing to reimburse ransom demands may well do that.”

Per-Åke Westerlund Rättvisepartiet Socialisterna (ISA in Sweden)

Why are the IMF Joe Biden and the UK government among many other capitalist institutions and governments suddenly advocating increased taxes? And will such measures solve any of the accumulating problems in the capitalist economy?

Within a short space of time the following proposals have been announced:

The Conservative British government increases corporation taxes from 19 to 25 percent over the next 4 years.

The new US president Joe Biden proposes to increase corporation taxes from 21 to 28 percent plus increased taxes on those earning over $400000 a year as part of financing a $3–4 trillion infrastructure plan. In addition the new administration wants a global (minimum) limit on corporate taxes.

The International Monetary Fund IMF advocates that “High earners and companies that prospered in the coronavirus crisis should pay additional tax to show solidarity”.

How big a political change do these proposals mark? Here is one comment to illustrate the answer:

“The other week I caught sight of a headline declaring that the IMF was warning against cuts in public spending and borrowing. The report stopped me in my tracks. After half a century or so as keeper of the sacred flame of fiscal prudence the IMF was telling policymakers in rich industrial nations they should not fret overmuch about huge build-ups of public debt during the Covid-19 crisis. John Maynard Keynes had been disinterred and the world turned upside down.

“(…)

“This was the IMF speaking… This is the organization that in the intervening years had a few simple answers to any economic problem you care to think of: fiscal retrenchment a smaller state and/or market liberalization. The advice was heralded as the Washington consensus because of the IMF’s location.” (Philip Stephens chief political commentator Financial Times 19 February)

It is also telling that these proposals come primarily from the same parties and governments that started the neoliberal wave in the “advanced” capitalist countries the US and Britain in the 1980s and 90s. Biden’s plan means the first tax increases in the US since 1993.

Why is This Happening?

In the words of the OECD: “In 1980 corporate tax rates around the world averaged 40.11 percent… Since then countries have recognized the impact that high corporate tax rates have on business investment decisions so that in 2020 the average is now 23.85 percent.”

The OECD reiterate the claimed motive of neoliberal tax cuts for the rich to set “business investments” free. In reality the attacks on public sector finances of which these tax cuts were part alongside reducing wages and worsening working conditions was the capitalist class waging class war against the working class in order to increase their profits.

This “liberation” of market forces never achieved the goals of stability growth and better lives for all which these politicians promised when talking to a mass audience. Instead it offered a record rise in inequality destroyed welfare where it had existed and accelerated an existential climate crisis. Already around 20 years ago this system was questioned by a movement against capitalist globalization.

The financial crisis in 2008–09 followed by the “Great Recession” underlined the fragility of the system. Ideas such as the “Tobin tax” on financial transactions and similar proposals from the economist Thomas Piketty reflected a growing realization among capitalists and politicians that something had to be done. Some billionaires started to advocate increased taxes and even the IMF warned against inequality.

But no government broke the pattern. Austerity for the people and billions to the rich was the medicine of the 2010s. This created wave after wave of struggles and movements of workers and the oppressed over the course of that decade. As it drew to a close in 2019 a wave of mass revolts spread through the planet which has continued since with only a short break when the pandemic started.

Therefore this turn in government policies has the following basic reasons: 1) The complete failure of the neoliberal ideology of the previous decades to stabilize the economy. 2) The fear of discontent and mass revolts from below further undermining capitalism and its political parties.

Of course the pandemic and the crisis it triggered played an important role. Massive state intervention in most countries was needed to avoid a total economic collapse. Companies were paid to not go bankrupt and even workers got some money especially in the US to keep up consumption (which counts for 70% of the US economy).

The OECD explains: “Estimates for the OECD as a whole in 2020 suggest an increase of 5 percentage points of GDP in the primary deficit adjusted for the economic cycle (a measure of the fiscal stance); and an increase of nearly 17 percentage points of GDP for gross public debt.” Average debt for G20 states increased from 82.1 percent of GDP in 2019 to 103.2 percent in 2021.

“Without those fiscal and monetary measures the global contraction last year would have been three times worse. This could have been another Great Depression” IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva commented.

Tax War and Tax Havens

For over a decade the OECD and G20 countries have negotiated to find global solutions to tax competition between governments. Differences in corporate taxes despite being cut everywhere are still big. From Barbados (5.5%) Hungary (9%) and Ireland (12.5%) to France (32%) and many African and Latin American countries at around 35%. There are also those with zero taxes tax havens such as Cayman Islands Jersey United Arab Emirates and others.

The website and NGO “Global Alliance for Tax Justice” estimates that “Countries are losing a total of over $427 billion in taxes each year to international corporate tax abuse and private tax evasion costing countries altogether the equivalent of nearly 34 million nurses’ annual salaries every year — or one nurse’s annual salary every second.”

Tax evasion schemes have been exposed by for example the “Panama papers” leaked in 2016 which showed the involvement of well known major banks and companies. Companies engage in all sorts of transactions and maneuvers to hide the full scale of their profits to avoid taxation. Tax haven are wide open for criminals and money laundering.

The tax war between countries has long been described as a race to the bottom. Less income for the public sector inevitably assists right-wing governments that want cuts and privatization. The US had a 35 percent corporation tax rate but Trump and the Republicans lowered it to 21 percent in 2017 just below global average. The increase proposed by Biden to 28% therefore is only restoring it to half the previous level.

In Europe the EU has been a main vehicle for neoliberalism pushing through privatizations and deregulation. Within the EU tax competition and other competition has continued. When the EU commission ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euro in taxes to Ireland the Irish government refused to accept it stating that Apple had already paid “the correct amount”. The Socialist Party (ISA in Ireland) pointed out how low taxes for big business was accompanied by sharp austerity for working people.

What can Biden achieve?

The US tax increase proposed by Biden is supposed to increase state income by 2 to 2.5 trillion dollars. Since this is over a period of 15 years it is actually a modest increase. It can be compared with the value of the US stock market which is over 50 trillion dollars.

The international proposal by Biden was circulated to 135 governments as part of the OECD tax negotiations. They have received positive responses from Berlin and Paris and a final proposal is supposed to be ready by the summer.

The proposal includes what the OECD names as two pillars: 1) a global minimum rate of corporation tax at 21 percent and 2) a proposal that multinationals should pay taxes in relation to sales in each country. The latter was a no-go for Trump who preferred continued tax cuts. Biden’s proposal even if it means Google or Microsoft paying more taxes in some countries is a way to avoid so-called digital taxes on different levels implemented by national governments.

A global minimum would also increase tax income in the US as there would be less reason to move headquarters abroad for tax reasons and for US businesses abroad which today pay 10.5 percent in taxes. There is a strong nationalist element in Biden’s seemingly “global” proposal. Other new policy announcements by Biden such as carving out a bigger role for the state and plans for infrastructure investments are also part of the new cold war with China.

This global proposal is also very modest. It will benefit richer countries and do nothing to stop global inequality rising. It covers only less than ten percent of the 2300 companies in the OECD’s original plan for global taxes.

Biden’s short term popularity arising from his stimulus packages and the recently more positive prognosis for the US economy give him some advantages. Still the Republican right alongside at least part of big business will oppose his plan. And of course many governments will have objections about a global tax rate especially in a period of increasing nationalism from capitalists and political parties.

The IMF’s proposals are also limited although they signify a change of course. What the IMF proposes is a temporary limited tax for super profits made during the pandemic.

Vitor Gaspar the IMF’s head of fiscal policy said “Vaccination is likely to be the global investment project with the highest return ever considered”. With so many affected negatively by the crisis a “solidarity tax” on extraordinary profits would have a “symbolic impact” he said.

While the IMF also has made positive comments about wealth and inheritance taxes both the fund and the OECD proposal underline that any support measures and state expenditure will be temporary. Working people should not get accustomed to state assistance.

Socialists and Taxes

High taxes are often described as socialist policies by politicians and the media. And of course we are in favor of increased taxes for billionaires and big business. At the same time we warn of the limitations of a policy of increased taxes.

In Biden’s case positive measures such as extra child benefits are made from above. The message is “The president is taking care of the problem no need for a democratically organized mass movement”. All measures under capitalism are temporary and in this case there is even an explicit time limit on the measure: September or December 2021. While Biden proposes to make this benefit permanent there were in fact no long term gains for working people in the $1.9 stimulus bill passed in March.

Increased taxes will not just be accepted silently by companies and the rich. They will hire thousands of tax evasion experts and they will increase prices or cut wages to shift the burden onto the working class.

Sweden was for a period roughly 1945–80 seen as a model where increased taxes and public welfare improved the lives of workers. But that came to an end because the taxes did not change the real balance of economic power and ownership. The capitalists were able to hit back because social democracy stayed within the framework of capitalism. A “social market economy” a la Piketty is impossible.

It is true that relatively mild tax increases would be enough to pay for cheaper housing higher pensions funding to schools and hospitals etc. But any such moves under capitalism are temporary. The bill will eventually be placed on workers and poor within the country and internationally.

The recent change in policy will not save capitalism from crisis. National tensions and contradictions massive debt and the danger of inflation later on will add to all the other factors causing crisis for this system.

Socialists are not cheerleaders for politicians who increase taxes. We support positive reforms and we prepare for struggles to defend and improve them. In the coming year it is likely that politicians will be met with problems when they want to abolish temporary measures of assistance to working people.

We understand the need for political parties of the working class and mass democratic social movements that fight for a change of system to abolish capitalism and establish democratic socialism.

To control big business the Amazons and Bezoses with taxes is as difficult as stopping the climate crisis by attempting to control the private oil companies. For socialists taxing private wealth is not enough the key question is the ownership of wealth. To take real power over the economy the nationalization of big business is necessary under democratic control by workers and poor and in real international cooperation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA1LTA5L2NoaW5hLXMtbXVjaC1oeXBlZC1kaWdpdGFsLXl1YW4tZmFpbHMtdG8taW1wcmVzcy1lYXJseS11c2Vyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China's Much-Hyped Digital Yuan Fails to Impress Early Users,"Sign up for Next China a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.

Indeed SaltPay has virtually zero online presence other than its own website. There are no mainstream press reports or interviews and a Google search lends little insight into the two-year-old European payments company.

But some are paying attention at least.

High-profile investors including Hedosophia and Tiger Global are among those who recently participated in SaltPay's April $500m Series C according to two sources.

So what is SaltPay? What's its big strategy? Why are investors buzzing about it? And why is the startup sweeping up tiny payments firms?

Sussing out SaltPay

Founded in 2019 SaltPay has taken an unusual approach in quickly building a pan-European cooperative of payments components targeting small and medium merchants.

In real terms that means several different payment brands now sit under the SaltPay group across Portugal Hungary the Czech Republic Iceland and the UK following an aggressive acquisition strategy (""they're spending like crazy"" one peer commented).

It also means the group does everything from merchant acquiring and issuance (eg. card processing and transactions) to offering credit to providing a broad suite of software services like spend management and loyalty schemes.

SaltPay's ""rollup"" strategy means it now employs over 800 people globally. It has doubled its staff in the last few months; drawing graduates from top schools like the London School of Economics.

If all that doesn't sound like your everyday early-stage startup... it's because it isn't.

SaltPay is led by an experienced founding team headed up by Eduardo Pontes a Brazilian entrepreneur who previously cofounded Stone — a Brazilian payments acquirer that went public in 2018 and is described as South America's Square. His cofounder Ali Mazanderani was also a board member at Stone.

The ""Stone gang"" have each invested personally into SaltPay an insider told Sifted and its founders remain the largest shareholders (the full list of investors remains undisclosed).

The ""next Adyen?""

SaltPay claims it is building Europe's ""go-to"" payments and operations hub for small and medium enterprises with its broad suite of efficiency-building and automated services.

The company told Sifted it currently counts over 60k merchants across its various subsidiaries largely concentrated in Eastern Europe with UK expansion next on the roadmap.

Aside from distributing directly to European merchants moreover it is also developing a software and infrastructure arm — akin to a fintech-as-a-service platform — to rent out globally.

That could put the company up against everyone from WorldPay to Marqueta as well as point-of-sale providers like SumUp or Viva Wallet.

Nonetheless in a rare interview Chairman Ali Mazanderani argued SaltPay was tapping into a market that is still underinvested in.

I'm super passionate about local entrepreneurs especially in tier two towns especially underserved areas... the market just doesn't really speak to them.

""All the focus in the fintech space is...enterprise online acceptance or digital banks. But we are interested in helping the family-owned restaurant outside Newcastle for example"" he said. ""I'm super passionate about local entrepreneurs especially in tier two towns especially underserved areas... the market just doesn't really speak to them.""

Mazanderani commented that SaltPay is using ""customer-centricity"" and its sprawling network of services to differentiate itself.

Today SaltPay's ambition is so vast that one analyst said SaltPay is known in investor circles to be ""selling [itself] as the next Adyen.""

Still Mazanderani poo-pooed the comparison.

""Our focus is simply on putting the small businesses first"" he told Sifted.

Buy not build

What's striking about SaltPay so far is its 'buy buy buy' approach to growth.

Over the last year SaltPay has used its funding arsenal to go on an M&A warpath scooping up six startups over the last 12 months — including Iceland's Bogun and London's YoYo Wallet.

Mazanderani who spent a decade in private equity says the acquisitions are an ""augmentative approach."" In layman terms that means SaltPay has radically changed its subsidiaries' compositions (although it's kept most of their original management in place).

SaltPay has several focuses; from merchant acquiring services to a ""software"" arm

For outsiders though SaltPay's M&A strategy has raised eyebrows.

One analyst Sifted spoke to described it as a ""weird PE rollup of companies"" while another questioned why SaltPay was ""hovering up all sorts of mediocre companies.""

Meanwhile an ex-SaltPay employee questioned whether ""buying companies left right and centre"" would lend a lack of focus.

The ex-employee also said that the takeovers has been bumpy at places like YoYo claiming that some staff the person had spoken to there were ""confused"" about the leadership and direction of their company after SaltPay took a majority stake.

""[SaltPay] need to be very aggressive with growth or they won't get foothold in a very competitive market....that's why they're buying...but you can't merge random groups together and expect it to all work out [immediately]"" the individual told Sifted speaking on the condition of anonymity.

Nonetheless Haakon Overli at Dawn Capital argues there's a clear logic to private equity growth approaches like this.

""It's a pretty smart thing to do...It's more common than you think"" he told Sifted. ""Plenty of Dawn's companies have grown very strongly with selective acquisitions.""

Keeping tabs

For all intents and purposes SaltPay describes itself as a London startup but in reality it looks more like an established global cooperative.

Filings in the US show the SaltPay group officially domains in the Cayman Islands.

Meanwhile its staff are spread across London Portugal and Czech Republic as well as tech hubs in South Africa and Iceland.

In terms of regulation SaltPay is licensed across Europe via its subsidiaries. For instance in the UK SaltPay is regulated via YoYo Wallet which it acquired last year and has an e-money license. FCA records show SaltPay previously used passporting agreements from Iceland.

If that's not enough SaltPay also appears to have a small European venture arm. Public records show the firm has taken minority stakes in several fintechs including Iceland's Noona.

Indeed SaltPay remains something of an enigma. It’s still unclear what it's building underneath the bonnet and its approach to growth makes it an anomaly among other London fintechs.

Still Europe's finance community is now beginning to take note of SaltPay eyeing a new contender intent on shaking up the sector.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbGNhbGlzdGVjaC5jb20vY3RlY2gvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMCw3MzQwLEwtMzkwNzIyOCwwMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Finastra Israel helping drive cashless payments revolution | Ctech,"Cashless payments experienced an unprecedented boom during the Covid-19 pandemic. The crisis provided the perfect storm for the sector with lockdowns combined with plentiful free time pushing even the reluctant technophobes to finally adopt online shopping.

One of the leading players in the space of cashless payments is financial enterprise software conglomerate Finastra which provides legacy financial technology in a wide range of sectors serving 8500 banks and financial institutions around the world including 90 of the top 100 global banks.

Finastra Israel is leading the company's payments department enabling customers to transfer over $20 trillion a day. Finastra’s payments business unit employs over 700 employees in four main locations: 350 in Israel 300 in India and the rest in Germany and the United States. The majority of the payments management is headquartered out of Israel including the General Manager of Payments head of R&D head of product strategy and customer support as well as VP Products Payments Ohad Chenkin.

""We provide between 80%-90% of the overall systems required for a bank to function. We're divided into four product lines. The payments business within Finastra which I'm part of has over 300 customers worldwide in five continents. We process $24 trillion every day within our systems which if you do the math means we transfer the world GDP every three-and-a-half days"" Chenkin told CTech. ""We serve five of the top 10 global banks with our payments solution. We transfer 40% of wire payments in the UK. We transfer 25% of all U.S. wire payments.""

Payments are also an important part in Finastra's open development platform named FusionFabric.cloud. By opening up core systems in Retail Banking Payments Lending Corporate Banking and Treasury & Capital Markets via open APIs Finastra aims to enable financial institutions and other parties in the fintech ecosystem to develop applications on top of their solutions.

""Companies are looking for a single payments solution these days both to reduce their costs and to have a vendor consolidation"" explained Chenkin. ""They want to leverage Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning based modules for automating payments prevention of fraud and automatic repair of broken payments. They're looking for a single payment hub to run their entire offering end-to-end and that's actually what we're offering.""

Chenkin said the pandemic dramatically changed the payments sector. ""We see a huge acceleration with the digitization of banks and in payments in particular. During 2020 there was a 30% increase in spending in cashless payments in the retail industry. About 72% of all payment transactions in 2020 were cashless"" he noted. ""Banks understand that now everything is moving even faster. And we do see a change in the way that they operate with the acceleration of those changes. This was a wake-up call to many of the banks and mainly to the more conservative ones."""

Thats what it comes down to for me for this year’s version of the team.

Before I really dive into why this team is so fun and why I am enjoying this season so far I want to give my thoughts on the new Globe Life Field itself. I went to two games as credentialed media member last season. But there were no fans so I couldn’t really get a feel for it aside from appearance alone.

So now that I went to the game on Saturday night as fan I feel like I have some quick thoughts about it.

First I want to say it gets really loud. It wasn’t even a full ballpark but the electricity in the stadium was comparable to a playoff game back during the World Series runs. I remember Jon Daniels saying in interviews the team felt that it could be even louder than Globe Life Park when they start playing important games again.

The capacity at Globe Life Field is 40300. On Saturday there was 26616.

Second the stadium looks better with the roof open. I am not really one of the baseball purest that thinks baseball should and only can be played outdoors. But I do think there is something about that stadium that looks better with the roof open.

Third I do feel that the stadium lacks personality. For example at the old stadium we had the tall scoreboard in left field Greene’s Hill in center and the homerun porch in right. With this stadium nothing stands out to me. I know they made the dimensions to honor former Rangers greats but the casual fan is not going to know the significance of what the numbers actually mean.

Now onto more important things and why I am sitting down to discuss this Rangers team.

In the past couple of seasons I am just going to say it: The team has been pretty much unwatchable a lot of the time. I thought the team lacked personality excitement and a direction.

This year is different. As much as I hated moving on from Elvis Andrus I can sit here today and say that was the right decision.

Isiah Kiner-Falefa has made that clear early on in the season. The on the field production is what ultimately matters in professional sports. However I don’t think you can overlook the off the field stuff.

Here is a quote from Isiah after Saturday nights exciting win on him and Nick Solak’s middle infield tandem.

“We’ve shown some great things but we’ve got a lot to work on. We are playing together and we want to stay here. We want to be Michael Young and Ian Kinsler. We want to show the organization that we are capable that we are options. And the only way to do it is to go out and prove it.”

That to me is an example of guys taking pride on the uniform they are wearing the history of the franchise and young guys that want to and take pride in being leaders.

Here is a quote from Chris Woodward about both of those young guys.

“Both of them have a pretty significant chip on their shoulder. They’ve been exactly what our staff and our organization would have envisioned for setting the tone off the field when it comes to effort attitude and energy. They kind of set the tone every day. And you know obviously the performance on the field has been really good.”

I talked about the team lacking excitement. There is no doubt that Adolis Garcia brings excitement. Garcia plays the game extremely hard. He has already come up in huge situations multiple times at the plate and in the field. And I love that he is not afraid to show his emotions when he comes through in big moments.

When I look at Nate Lowe Willie Calhoun Solak and IKF Dane Dunning I see pieces that could end up being long-term solutions and pieces to build around. I didn’t mention Joey Gallo here but if this continues I would want to keep him around as well because I do think he’s a very big part of this rebuilding process. But if the Rangers don’t show enough he will have to be moved to continue rebuilding the organization.

One of the most important things to the World Series runs in 2010 and 2011 was the joy the team played with and I see that with the 2021 Rangers.

Now that isn’t to say that Texas will be World Series contenders this season. Regardless of the record I can say that I am enjoying Rangers baseball again and the future doesn’t look as bleak as it did coming into the season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvcmFuZ2Vycy8yMDIxLzA1LzA5L3Bob3Rvcy1iYWNrLWF0LTUwMC1yYW5nZXJzLWNlbGVicmF0ZS13aW4tb3Zlci1tYXJpbmVycy1hdC1nbG9iZS1saWZlLWZpZWxkL9IBjwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvcmFuZ2Vycy8yMDIxLzA1LzA5L3Bob3Rvcy1iYWNrLWF0LTUwMC1yYW5nZXJzLWNlbGVicmF0ZS13aW4tb3Zlci1tYXJpbmVycy1hdC1nbG9iZS1saWZlLWZpZWxkLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: Back at .500!

The new nachos feature tortillas chips topped with creamy cashew-based queso made by family-owned brand Credo Foods. Husband-and-wife team Adam and Madeline Salamon—who are both vegans—founded the company to fill a gap in the market for authentically cheesy queso dips and sauces but made without animal products.

In addition to Globe Life Field Credo Foods’ vegan queso was previously offered at racing track Circuit of the Americas in Austin TX and the company aims to return to the track this year. As the COVID-19 pandemic subsidies and concessions begin to reopen Credo Foods hopes to expand its vegan queso to additional stadiums with the goal of reaching 500 sporting arenas by 2025. “One of our goals is to have the biggest impact we can” Adam Salamon a former tech industry executive told VegNews. “We want to replace nacho cheese in every stadium in America.”

For the rest of this year’s baseball season customers can find the new vegan ballpark nachos at Globe Life Field’s all-vegan cart which began serving plant-based fare to fans in 2016. This year Globe Life Field is also one of the select stadiums to offer Oatly’s vegan oat milk soft serve available at Going Going Green on the lower concourse level and Karbach Skyporch on the upper concourse level.

The Ben & Jerry’s of dips

In addition to replacing dairy-based nacho cheese at stadiums nationwide the brand aims to redefine the dip category by developing uniquely bold flavors with creative mix-ins. Madeline Salamon created the first iteration of Credo Foods’ queso as a mac and cheese sauce for the couple’s young daughter. Since then Credo Foods has launched a variety of cashew-based products including medium spicy and chorizo queso flavors a french onion dip and three flavors (Plain Strawberry and Chive & Onion) of cream cheese.

“Almost what Ben & Jerry’s did with ice cream we want to do that to the dips category” Adam Salamon said. To that end Credo Foods is launching its newest product Jalapeño Popper Dip—which mimics the flavor of the spicy and tangy party snack in dip form—at select Whole Foods Market locations in Los Angeles Texas Oklahoma and Arkansas in mid-June. On May 10 Credo Foods will also expand its retail distribution to Sprouts Farmers Market stores nationwide which will offer the medium and spicy flavors of its vegan queso.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2Rmdy5jb20vbmV3cy9zcG9ydHMvZ2FyY2lhLWhvbWVycy1kcml2ZXMtaW4tNS1hcy1yYW5nZXJzLWJlYXQtbWFyaW5lcnMtMTAtMi8yNjI3NzIxL9IBaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2Rmdy5jb20vbmV3cy9zcG9ydHMvZ2FyY2lhLWhvbWVycy1kcml2ZXMtaW4tNS1hcy1yYW5nZXJzLWJlYXQtbWFyaW5lcnMtMTAtMi8yNjI3NzIxLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garcia Homers Drives in 5 as Rangers Beat Mariners 10-2,"Adolis Garcia hit his team-leading ninth homer and drove in a career-high five runs Dane Dunning struck out 10 in five innings and the Texas Rangers beat the Seattle Mariners 10-2 on Sunday.

The past seven victories for the Rangers have come after falling behind this time when they answered Seattle's two-run fifth for a 2-1 lead with six runs in the bottom of the inning.

Nick Solak had a tiebreaking two-run double as the first six Texas hitters reached base including Jose Trevino on shortstop J.P. Crawford's first error in 27 games and third of the day for the Mariners.

The first of two RBI singles from Garcia came after back-to-back errors from third baseman Kyle Seager and second baseman Dylan Moore in the third. The other gave the Rangers a 9-2 lead in the sixth and made the 28-year-old Cuban the first Texas rookie in seven years with five RBIs in a game.

Dunning (2-2) left the mound trailing 2-1 after topping his previous career high of seven strikeouts while matching the most for a Texas pitcher at Globe Life Field which opened last year. It was also a season high for the Rangers.

The 26-year-old right-hander making his 14th career appearance all starts allowed RBI singles to Mitch Haniger and Seager. Dunning's outing ended on a groundout by Jose Marmolejos two pitches after Marmolejos just missed a grand slam down the line in right.

Charlie Culberson led off the Texas fifth with his third homer Solak broke the 2-all tie with a liner down the line in left and Garcia capped the six-batter stretch with a shot into the Seattle bullpen in left-center field off Justus Sheffield (2-3). The left-hander allowed seven runs -- five earned -- in five innings.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Mariners: RHP Ljay Newsome went on the 10-day injured list with right elbow inflammation and RHP JT Chargois was promoted from Triple-A Tacoma. Newsome was 1-1 with a 7.98 ERA after being recalled from the alternate training site April 7. The 30-year-old Chargois who pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings has 85 major league appearances over three seasons with Minnesota and the Los Angeles Dodgers. He pitched in Japan last year.

Rangers: RHP Kohei Arihara was placed on the 10-day IL with a bruised right middle finger and OF Eli White was recalled from Triple-A Round Rock a day after being sent down. Arihara in his first big league season since coming over from Japan has allowed 16 earned runs in 8 1/3 innings over his past three starts. The move came a day after Seattle scored five runs in 3 2/3 innings against him. … RHP Kyle Cody (right shoulder inflammation) was transferred to the 60-day IL to make room for C Jack Kruger who was claimed off waivers from the Los Angeles Angels.

UP NEXT

Mariners: Seattle finishes a five-game trip with two interleague games at the Dodgers starting Tuesday. RHP Justin Dunn (1-0 3.51 ERA) is the scheduled starter. Dunn has four no-decisions in five starts.

Rangers: RHP Kyle Gibson (3-0 2.40 ERA) is scheduled to start the first of two interleague matchups in San Francisco on Monday. Gibson is in the top 10 in ERA among AL starters despite giving up five runs without making it out of the first inning in the shortest opening day start in franchise history.

TORONTO April 19 2021 -- The Canadian affiliate arm of Goldman Sachs has agreed to a strategic investment into the rapidly growing NFT and DeFi protocol Juggernaut (JGN). Juggernaut has focused extensively on the rapidly growing NFT (non-fungible token) market and DeFi use-cases on BSC (Binance Smart Chain).

Community Work and Leadership Roles in Business School:

Co-President Follies

VP of Accessibility CBS Reflects

Peer Advisor

Which academic or extracurricular achievement are you most proud of during business school? I am most proud of my time leading Follies. There is a lot of pressure in school to focus on career and academics but I took the risk of throwing myself fully into Follies to have a creative outlet. It became my family at CBS always kept me laughing (especially when recruiting had me crying!) and taught me more hands-on lessons about being a manager than any other business school experience. My Co-President Olivia Mell and I have been able to create an environment that is inclusive encourages peers to try new things and to foster community throughout the school on show night.

What achievement are you most proud of in your professional career? In the context of my life simply having a professional career is a major achievement. I have a degenerative muscle disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy and I use a power wheelchair. Every day I require the assistance of hired help to do tasks like getting dressed or cooking. Professionally I don’t have any role models that look like me in media from my workplaces business school or in the C-suites of major companies. For people with disabilities who have complex health needs government policies disincentivize us from working at a professional level in order to keep our healthcare. Between battling this system managing my care team daily and navigating the workplace as a wheelchair user I am incredibly proud of where I am. The journey has had countless challenges. While there will be more I will always pursue my professional aspirations as they have provided me with self-determination and purpose.

Why did you choose this business school? One of the primary reasons I chose CBS was because of the amazing financial aid resources and the team working hard to meet my need. As a first-generation college student with a single mom supporting a young sibling the financial commitment of school was a significant hurdle. Taking on major debt would be a risk I wasn’t sure I could reasonably take. The financial aid office listened to my story and made the assistance I asked for available. There were many reasons Columbia was right for me but their work made Columbia possible.

Who was your favorite MBA professor? Easy – Professor Todd Jick! His Organizational Change course left me with real tools to take into my next role. I also took Bridging the American Divide (co-taught with Bruce Usher) a refreshing – at times frustrating – outlet to dive deeper on issues dividing America such as poverty education race and technology. That said Professor Jick could teach a course on how to bake bread and it would be incredibly engaging. His love of teaching is apparent and as a student it inspires me to learn. As an added bonus Professor Jick is Follies’ #1 supporter often making cameos in our show!

Looking back over your MBA experience what is the one thing you’d do differently and why? I wish I took more opportunities to be vulnerable by discussing the experience of disability and effects of ableism with my peers. While I did find chances to do this I also held back at times out of fear of being put into a box. It was important for me to share this aspect of my identity not only for my peers to get to know me better but also to help educate them on the disability community. Knowing my peers are future business leaders I hope what I shared may inform their decisions that could impact customers and product users with disabilities.

What is the biggest myth about your school? I think one of the biggest myths about CBS is that it is primarily a finance school. I have found that while the finance program is very strong there are so many other rich career communities within Columbia Business School. From retail and luxury goods social enterprise consulting and more I quickly realized that any career path that appeals to you will have support at CBS.

What is one thing you did during the application process that gave you an edge at the school you chose? I would say being authentic is critical. Going through my application process and helping others with their applications now I see that sometimes people want to try to fit a mold of what they think Columbia Business School is looking for. During my interview I did what I could to highlight the things about myself that I thought were different unique and showed off my individual personality. When you are trying to be what you think someone else wants you to be you can hold yourself back and come across as disingenuous.

Which MBA classmate do you most admire? The student I admire the most is Samuel Sates. Sam was my learning team member and the first friend I made at school. I quickly realized he is one of the most authentic people at CBS and truly one-of-a-kind. His kindness knows no bounds. He truly values learning about others and will go out of his way to engage with people especially those that are different from him. He genuinely cares about people learning and pushing himself to make the most of his business school experience. I regularly ask myself ‘what would Sam do?’ when I am trying to be a better version of me.

How disruptive was it to shift to an online or hybrid environment after COVID hit? I found shifting online challenging from not only an academic perspective but from a social perspective. One of my goals coming into Business School was to be more social. That goal wasn’t achieved in the manner I had hoped due to COVID but through clubs like Follies I have been able to maintain a close sense of community. The CBS administration created a safe environment for us to film in person and those weekends are my best memories as I was otherwise isolating.

Who most influenced your decision to pursue business in college? One of my closest friends Neimy Escobar most influenced my decision. I knew that I wanted to leave finance and pursue another industry but was feeling incredibly stuck. I had not considered business school before as I don’t necessarily consider myself an academic. She began her process of applying while educating me on the opportunities that Business School could create and that it is much more than just academics. She gave me the courage to apply and was my study partner for the GMAT. We both ended up going to Columbia Business School and I am so thankful for her motivation.

What are the top two items on your professional bucket list? The first item on my professional bucket list is changing the policies that prevent people with disabilities from pursuing substantive employment while keeping their Medicaid. If I could say that my advocacy work created more representation of people with disabilities in the workplace that would truly be a dream come true. The second item on my bucket list would be to join the board of a Fortune 500 company.

What made Chanel such an invaluable addition to the Class of 2021?

“Chanel is an invaluable member of the community as she and the Co-President of Follies have worked tirelessly to keep CBS traditions alive even virtually. Her time commitment and dedication to the CBS community is not only recognized with her tremendous work on Follies but also the partnerships she has fostered with the Jerome A. Chazen Institute for Global Business and the Office of Student Affairs (OSA). Chanel was a crucial partner on the Fall 2020 Peer Advisor team and made an incredible impact on the incoming class of 2022 while partnering with OSA for the first ever virtual Orientation. Chanel’s commitment to her work with the Black Business Student Association and Diversity Equity and Inclusion also will be part of her legacy as she spoke to her authentic self during 2020’s Black History Month Black Experience Panel which left a lasting impression on the CBS community.”

After the Two Sessions there is usually the China Development Forum in Beijing and the Boao Forum in tropical Hainan province from which China watchers can catch many policy signals. We’ve collected views and insights from the Boao Forum in late April especially points on financial opening digital currency and financial support for carbon neutrality in a special briefing for our readers. The original comments were mostly made in Chinese and they have been translated and edited for clarity.

Financial opening

China’s financial opening has two components in the area of capital markets. One is opening up to financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs to enter the market; the other is basic opening to overseas investors through QFII and the Shanghai-Hong Kong and Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect programs.

• With the increase of foreign investment’s holdings in recent years our stock market became much better. One reason is the growing role of foreign capital in pricing.

• The CSRC attaches great importance to the stability of China’s stock market and takes good precautions. For example for the Shanghai-Hong Kong and Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect programs we have maintained a daily quota of 50 billion yuan in and 42 billion yuan out. When the stock connect programs were designed it was stipulated that if a certain foreign capital caused large fluctuations in the stock market its trading could be suspended temporarily. The CSRC has the means to prevent the large inflow and outflow of foreign capital causing market instability.

○ Foreign retail investors which make up a small share will not affect China’s financial stability.

○ Foreign mutual funds pension funds and insurance companies engaged in global asset allocation; they can stabilize the market and position for the long term. They are very welcome and the largest proportion of positions held today.

○ Foreign brokers with hedge funds’ backing these could be our concern.

U.S.-listed Chinese companies currently face audit supervision problems. The CSRC considers the requests made by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) perfectly reasonable since Chinese companies are listed in the United States they must abide by American rules. We should find a way for the PCAOB to inspect Chinese accounting firms and do so in a manner that meets China’s national security requirements.

• The CSRC and the PCAOB had been working together for at least four or five years and I have always been personally in charge of this subject. There was a great deal of progress and then the political climate in the United States shifted greatly. As a result cooperation with China declined.

• The CSRC provided the latest proposal on Aug. 4 2020 to satisfy the PCAOB’s requirement with a joint inspection but unfortunately because of the political atmosphere they have not responded to any of email inquiries we sent monthly since August last year. Besides the U.S. has rolled out some regulatory measures such as mandatory delisting. In my opinion this is not a cooperative attitude.

• The CSRC hopes that the new U.S. administration will refocus on Sino-U.S. financial cooperation which is in the interest of the U.S. and is what many financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs are looking for as well.

Digital payments

• Currently the central bank’s priority in developing the digital yuan remains upgrading its retail system. The development of the digital yuan initially targets China’s vast retail market rather than using it for cross-border transactions as improving retail system efficiency is the basis for developing all other businesses including the wholesale system and cross-border payments.

• Both digital currencies and digital assets should serve the real economy. Cryptocurrencies are still in the early stages of development and it remains to be seen whether they can better act as investment alternatives.

• Cross-border payments via central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are very complex. Given that every country has its own macro-control situations and monetary sovereignty certain foreign exchange controls cannot be easily removed meaning there will be no trend towards monetary integration in the short term. However with respect to the monetary sovereignty of central banks digital technology can still be used to greatly improve convenience.

• The potential of cross-border use of the digital yuan will mainly depend on the Chinese currency’s global status which would be determined by China’s economy currency stability and convertibility. It also depends on market choice. Global market participants will compare and choose the best among different currencies.

○ China’s CBDC will not have a major impact on global financial markets as its use in cross-border payments is currently found mainly in small retail operations.

• There are strengths and weaknesses of yuan internationalization when it is compared to U.S. dollar

○ Strengths: China is the world’s second-largest economy. In addition to the sound development of trade and modern service industries China also has a large number of outbound tourism consumers many countries therefore attach great importance to Chinese consumers.

○ Weaknesses: The yuan still trails behind the U.S. dollar in terms of convertibility and free use. However as China’s economic and trade status continues to rise so will the status of the currency.

• Hong Kong residents will be able to use the digital yuan without any obstacles and digital development will bring more convenience in the future. The PBOC and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are studying cross-border payments using digital yuan with technical testing already underway.

There is no specific timetable for digital yuan’s official rollout but the PBOC is considering launching trials in more cities and having them cover more usage scenarios to enhance its ecosystem. Meanwhile the PBOC is studying regulatory rules for Bitcoin and Stablecoins. If any type of Stablecoin is to become a widely-used instrument for payment in the future it must be subject to strict oversight like financial institutions.

• Lessons from previous digital yuan pilot projects include:

○ The two-tier system of the digital yuan appeared to be working. The issuance and distribution mechanism of the digital yuan are compatible with the existing financial system helping to minimize the impact on the banking sector.

○ Digital currency has controllable anonymity. Small transactions can be anonymized under current system while larger transactions can be tracked.

○ The central bank could try a hybrid system. The digital yuan can be linked to both the banking system and the token system. This way it has different degrees of coupling in different technical solutions.

• The progress of the digital yuan. The focus of developing the digital yuan will be mainly for domestic use. There is no detailed timetable on the progress of the digital yuan but there are still things to be done before its nationwide rollout including:

○ Increasing the number of trials and expanding its scope. China is trying to make it possible for foreign athletes and visitors to use its digital currency during the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022.

○ Boosting the infrastructure for the yuan’s digitalization to improve the security and reliability of the system.

○ Setting up a set of legal and regulatory frameworks to monitor relevant businesses.

• Yuan internationalization is a natural process that does not aim to replace the U.S. dollar or any other currency but let the market make choices and facilitate international trade and investment. The PBOC has joined the Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency (mCBDC) and it will cooperate with global partners to work out a cross-border payment solution for digital currencies over time.

• China considers crypto assets like Bitcoin and Stablecoins as investment alternatives and highlights the need for a better regulatory environment for such assets. If any type of Stablecoin is to become a widely-used instrument for payment in the future it must be subject to strict oversight like financial institutions. But before the launch of any regulatory measures regulators will maintain what they are doing right now.

Financial support for carbon neutrality

• First we need to mobilize funds to support low-carbon transformation:

○ The central bank set standards for green bonds and green credit in 2015 and 2018 respectively and completed a catalogue of green bond projects.

○ We will enhance reporting and disclosure. Financial institutions are now required to disclose green financial debt issued in the interbank market and report on the use of green credit. In the future a mandatory information disclosure system will be established step by step covering all types of financial institutions and financing entities and unifying disclosure standards.

○ Build incentives. Green bonds and green credits have been included in the pool of eligible collateral facilitated by the central bank. In addition to creating emission reduction support tools the central bank will increase support for green finance and carbon reduction through commercial bank ratings deposit insurance rates and macro-prudential assessments.

• Second we must manage the financial risks associated with climate change

○ The central bank will assess the impact of climate change on financial stability and monetary policy in a timely manner and study the key strategies for financial institutions to systematically consider climate change when conducting stress tests.

○ The central bank will also continue to increase the allocation of green bonds in its foreign exchange reserves curb investment in high-carbon assets and incorporate climate factors into its investment risk management framework.

○ The PBOC encourages financial institutions to prepare for the climate challenge. The central bank has instructed some financial institutions to measure the carbon emissions of these projects and assess their climate and environmental risks. The central bank is exploring the establishment of a national carbon accounting system and has evaluated the green credit situation of banks on a quarterly basis. Financial institutions are being studied to prepare for a performance evaluation system on green credit green bonds and others.

• Third we must strengthen international coordination and cooperation

○ There is a wide demand and broad consensus in Asia on green transformation. Major economies have taken positive actions and cooperation at the regional level is progressing in an orderly way.

• There are still some problems in the development of green finance. For example the price of some assets does not fully reflect the negative externalities on the environment.

○ The environmental information of some enterprises is not effectively disclosed.

○ Many industries have not incorporated carbon pricing in their work.

From Ouyang Weimin president of China Development Bank (CDB)

• Development finance is an important way to achieve carbon neutrality. At present the CDB holds more than 2.3 trillion yuan of green credit bonds issued 70 billion yuan of green credit bonds in total. The bank will focus on implementing the “100 billion 100 counties” project to select no less than 100 counties and to provide a 100 billion yuan total loan commitment.

• Looking overseas the CDB has a loan balance of more than $70 billion in Asia and more than $160 billion along the Belt and Road and in co-founding countries.

Role of sustainable finance in the Belt and Road Initiative

From Qian Keming vice minister of commerce

• The latest progress in the Belt and Road:

○ Trade volume between China and the countries along the route has steadily increased accounting for an increasing proportion of the total foreign trade of the whole country.

○ Global cross-border investment experienced some decline due to the Covid-19 pandemic; however Belt and Road investment saw stable growth.

○ The new contracts China signed with foreign countries last year were mainly with countries along the Belt and Road.

○ China has signed free trade agreements and established working groups on investment trade in services and e-commerce cooperation mechanisms with a number of Belt and Road countries.

○ China and the countries along the route have built a lot of green infrastructure since the Belt and Road was proposed in 2013.

• Next China will focus the following tasks:

○ Promoting green and low-carbon energy in markets along the Belt and Road balancing local demand and sustainable development.

○ Integrating the green development concept into the whole process of outbound investment and overseas cooperation.

○ Promoting the sustainability of developing countries’ debt. Debt issues related to the Belt and Road are complicated and the key to their resolution is development. China will continue to promote debt sustainability in developing countries. Specific measures include:

▪ Participating in the G-20’s initiative to postpone the debt repayment of the poorest countries.

▪ Promoting projects in developing countries that generate steady cash flow and profits.

▪ Strengthening cooperation with other parties to address the debt vulnerabilities of heavily indebted poor countries.

TOLEDO Ohio — A man is in custody after being barricaded inside a residence on Charlestown Ave. in west Toledo on Saturday afternoon.

Toledo police and SWAT had to be called out to the residence.

A TPD negotiator said police were initially called to the home regarding a domestic incident between 38-year-old Andrea Hartford and 38-year-old Aaron Hopkins.

Police say when they showed up Hopkins told officers he'd shoot if they came inside. Hopkins would not let police inside to check on the safety of Hartford and was known to have multiple misdemeanor warrants.



SWAT and negotiators were sent to the scene around 1:40 p.m. SWAT was on scene as of 2:20 p.m.

Negotiators were able to successfully talk Hartford out of the house who was taken to the hospital with a dog bite that happened prior to police arrival.

Hopkins was not responsive to negotiations so TPD and SWAT “introduced tear gas” to the house and the suspect exited the house where he was taken into custody.

A TPD negotiator said Hopkins will likely be charged with misdemeanors including menacing. He was taken to the Lucas County Jail.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd2UtaGEuY29tL2NvbmFyZC1hbmQtaGFsbC1hbm5vdW5jZS10aGlyZC1xdWFydGVyLWhvbm9yLXJvbGwtMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Conard and Hall Announce Third Quarter Honor Roll,"The following students have received maximum and general honors for the third marking period for the 2020-2021 school year.

Serth was riding on a motorized skateboard on April 20 when he suddenly fell to the pavement and hit his head without wearing a helmet. Soon after the fall Serth began experiencing seizures. A friend who witnessed the incident called 911 and supported Serth until he was rushed to Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Providence RI.

According to the most recent update provided on the #WillPower Facebook Page Serth is currently awake but heavily sedated and still requires a feeding tube. In addition Serth has begun to regain movement in his limbs and is undergoing physical therapy from his hospital bed.

Serth is a senior at Rogers High School in Newport RI. During the 2020-2021 swim season he was named a captain of his high school team. At Rogers Serth holds several team records and was a Rhode Island State Championship qualifier during his freshman sophomore and junior seasons (Rhode Island did not hold a State Championship meet during his senior season due to COVID-19). During his freshman campaign Serth finished first overall in the 100 breaststroke at the Division 2 Boys State Championship with a time of 1:04.93.

Serth came in second during his sophomore year with a time of 1:05.67 and placed 3rd overall during his junior season with a time of 1:03.35.

Outside of school Serth competes for the Newport County YMCA where he is a New England Swimming Championship finalist.

Serth´s family has set up a GoFundMe page to help cover the cost of his medical expenses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cGVyaGVyb2h5cGUuY29tL2dlZWstY3VsdHVyZS80OTczNTctc2lkZXNob3ctaW50cm9kdWNlcy1mdWxseS1wb3NlYWJsZS0xNi1pbmNoLXN0YXItd2Fycy1nZW5lcmFsLWdyaWV2b3VzLWZpZ3VyZdIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdXBlcmhlcm9oeXBlLmNvbS9nZWVrLWN1bHR1cmUvNDk3MzU3LXNpZGVzaG93LWludHJvZHVjZXMtZnVsbHktcG9zZWFibGUtMTYtaW5jaC1zdGFyLXdhcnMtZ2VuZXJhbC1ncmlldm91cy1maWd1cmUvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sideshow Introduces 16-Inch Star Wars General Grievous Figure,"It can be easy to forget sometimes that Sideshow still has the license for 1/6 scale Star Wars figures. Mainly because Sideshow also distributes Hot Toys domestically. Hot Toys also does Star Wars in that scale and as with most things they do turn out the best and priciest versions imaginable. Competing with them is never a sensible option. But filling in gaps they seem unlikely to get to any time soon? That’s an opportunity. And one that brought about this magnificent General Grievous figure.

Grievous’ design always proves a major challenge for toymakers because they cannot reuse any pre-existing bodies. Above and beyond that the movie design cheats some of the things any hypothetical cyborg body in that style could feasibly do. So this figure might not excel at a spider-walk Rather than splitting open his arms feature interchangeable forearms for open and closed looks. But he has everything else. Including articulated fingers a lined cape with pockets four lightsabers and hilts and a magnaguard staff.

The figure includes multiple ball joints to achieve as many poses as possible and an action stand to facilitate the more dynamic stances. He stands 16 inches tall when fully upright though the General tends to hunch forward and not necessarily embrace good posture. At $285 he’s not cheap but significantly more affordable than a Hot Toys figure of the same size. Preorder now for delivery next summer.

Will your collection encounter some Grievous harm? Check out the full gallery below and let us know in comments.

Paramount Pictures has enjoyed a stellar reputation in the film industry due to its status as one of the oldest film studios in the world. Founded way back in 1912 the studio was built on the premise that cinema belongs to the working-class. Over the years it has produced masterpieces like Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho and Roman Polanski’s Rosemary’s Baby among many others.

“It’s an incredibly storied institution and one of the oldest studios. Some of the best movies ever made were made here. The chance to revive it is an exciting one” said Paramount’s CEO Jim Gianopulos. “It’s surprising it got so bumpy here for a couple of years because all the elements are in place. There are only six companies that comprise all the elements of a major studio and this is one of them. You want to see it achieve its full potential. There’s no reason why it shouldn’t be more successful than it’s been recently.”

He added “We have people money resources global distribution and the reach of almost four billion people that Viacom touches around the world. If you can’t make that work something’s not right. There is a great executive team here and a lot of very talented and dedicated people who want to win and who despite disappointments at the box office have a great sense of purpose direction and talent.”

On the 109th anniversary of its conception we take a look at 10 of the most successful Paramount Pictures releases of all time in order to understand its impact on popular culture.

The 10 most successful Paramount Pictures movies:

10. Transformers (Michael Bay – 2007)

Michael Bay’s Transformers is a well-known work in the sci-fi genre due to its popularity in the mainstream consciousness. It features a massive war between two extraterrestrial factions as they fight to gain control of the AllSpark. The film grossed $709709780 worldwide.

Bay said “I make my own movie I don’t have someone tell me what to do. I’ve always been inspired by Steven. I was not a Transformers fan before I signed on to this movie. I think I was two years older when the toys came out so I just discovered girls then instead of Optimus Prime. But I quickly became after I went to Hasbro where you heard about that Transformers school?

“I really thought ‘What the fuck am I going to Hasbro for Transformers school? I thought I was going to learn how to fold up robots but I met with the CEO and I went through the whole Transformer lore. I’ve been offered a lot of superhero movies before and nothing’s really appealed to me and in the room because I’ve been such a fan of Japanese Anime it just hit me that if I make this really real it could be something very new and different.”

9. Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted (Tom McGrath Eric Darnell Conrad Vernon – 2012)

The third film in the immensely popular Madagascar series the beloved animated work features the cohort of zoo animals who end up in Europe while trying to get back to New York. Even though it was probably not the best film in the franchise it was definitely the most successful one from a commercial perspective.

Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted grossed $746921274 worldwide and became the eighth-highest grossing film from 2012. The film also received several prestigious nominations including one for Best Animated Feature at the Critics’ Choice Movie Awards.

8. Shrek Forever After (Mike Mitchell – 2010)

The fourth instalment in the iconic Shrek franchise Mike Mitchell’s 2010 animated film portrays the titular character in a domesticated existence. In order to get out of his predicament Shrek signs a sinister contract with Rumpelstiltskin. Shrek Forever After became the fifth-highest grossing film of the year and made $752600867 worldwide.

While making the film the primary question that Mitchell grappled with was: “How do we give the audience what they know and love but at the same time give it a fresh take make it more beautiful?” He explained “We’ve taken on the bittersweet challenge of wrapping up the story of Shrek. We know fans would want to see how it ends.”

7. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Steven Spielberg – 2008)

Many fans of the Indiana Jones series consider Kingdom of the Crystal Skull to be the worst addition to its legacy. It features an ageing Jones (played by Harrison Ford) in the search for ancient civilisations and a mysterious crystal skull. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull ended up making $786636033 on a global scale.

“I’m very happy with the movie. I always have been” the director admitted. “I sympathise with people who didn’t like the MacGuffin because I never liked the MacGuffin. George [Lucas] and I had big arguments about the MacGuffin. I didn’t want these things to be either aliens or inter-dimensional beings. But I am loyal to my best friend.

“When he writes a story he believes in – even if I don’t believe in it – I’m going to shoot the movie the way George envisaged it. I’ll add my own touches I’ll bring my own cast in I’ll shoot the way I want to shoot it but I will always defer to George as the storyteller of the Indy series. I will never fight him on that.”

6. Mission: Impossible – Fallout (Christopher McQuarrie – 2018)

Starring Tom Cruise as the famous Ethan Hunt this 2018 spy thriller presents a hunt for plutonium as terrorists threaten to blow three cities. The wildly successful film made $220.2 million in North America alone and ended up with a total gross of $791.1 million worldwide.

“Mission is always a little bit of an underdog. This franchise doesn’t have the wind under its wings that something like Bond does. We always feel like we have something to prove. We never take that success for granted” the director said. “There are a lot of franchises that are always looking to top themselves or take their movies to the next level but the secret to our success is we aren’t trying to top ourselves.”

5. Shrek the Third (Chris Miller – 2007)

Chris Miller’s 2007 animated film has to be one of the most commercially successful directorial debuts of all time. The third addition to the Shrek series this version reveals Shrek’s doubts as he is hesitant to take the reigns of the kingdom as a ruler. The film grossed $813367380 worldwide.

“The way we look at the series is just sort of as a continuous story” Miller elaborated. “We didn’t want to just sort of title it like it was just a sequel. [We wanted] something to make it stand on its own give it its own personality and really try to treat it as a chapter in Shrek’s life. I quite like the name because there were other iterations of it that just felt like the title for any sequel.”

4. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Michael Bay – 2009)

Starring Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky Revenge of the Fallen continues the story of its predecessor two years after the events of the first film. Bay faced a lot of problems during this particular production especially his team going on strike. However Revenge of the Fallen became a commercial success and earned $836303693 at the worldwide Box Office.

Bay said: “On the second movie we got burned. We had a writers strike we had to agree on a story in three weeks and then we knew they were going on strike. It was a fucked scenario all the way around it wasn’t fair to the writer it wasn’t fair to me it wasn’t fair to anybody. It was still an entertaining movie but I think we failed on certain aspects.”

3. Transformers: Age of Extinction (Michael Bay – 2014)

Michael Bay’s Transformers series is undoubtedly one of the highest-grossing film franchises. Age of Extinction is just another example of the influence of Transformers on popular culture even though the film was poorly received by critics and considered to be sub-par. Age of Extinction made $1104054072 worldwide.

While talking about the series Michal Bay commented: “Movie franchises have to grow up a little bit. You start off kind of like fun trying to figure out what it was you know what I’m saying? That kind of setup. But I like it a little bit more grounded. Still fun but grounded.”

2. Transformers: Dark of the Moon (Michael Bay – 2011)

The most financially successful instalment in the Transformers series Dark of the Moon continues the war between the Autobots and Decepticons as they engage in a massive power struggle. The film earned Oscar bids for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Editing among others. Dark of the Moon ended up with a worldwide gross of $1.12 billion.

“We tried to learn from the second movie” the filmmaker admitted. “What we did with this movie is I think we have a much better script and we got back to basics. I think there’s some really cool action on this movie there’s some very cool conspiracy there’s great robot stuff in this that people were missing in the second one you’ve got great robot conflict.”

1. Titanic (James Cameron – 1997)

It’s extremely impressive that Titanic has retained its status as the highest-grossing Paramount production both in North America as well as worldwide even after all these years. James Cameron’s famous romantic drama sits at the top of the list with a monumental worldwide gross of $2.18 billion.

Cameron reflected “I had dark hours on Titanic as dire as Piranha II. We missed the iceberg by that much. But I’m at my best when I’m neck-deep in ice water trying to work out how we’re going to keep the lights turned on when the water hits the bulbs.”

Adding “Titanic was conceived as a love story. If I could have done it without one effect I would’ve been happy. It was definitely a goal to integrate a very personal emotional style with spectacle – and try to make that not be chocolate syrup on a cheeseburger you know. The cathartic experience is what made the film work.”"

(WVLT) - The Hershey Company recalled 1700 bottles of Hershey’s Chocolate Shell Topping due to an undeclared allergen.

The shell topping is made with almonds. According to the Food and Drug Administration almonds are not declared as an ingredient on the recalled products.

The products were shipped nationwide between April 15 and May 3 2021 and bear the product code “25JSAS1.”

The FDA said products purchased before April 15 are not included in the recall.

Hershey has instructed all retailers that received the affected product to immediately remove it from store shelves.

Anyone who purchased Hershey’s Chocolate Shell Topping products after April 15 with the lot code “25JSAS1” should not consume the product and can call Hershey Consumer Relations for a full refund

Only 1700 bottles are impacted by the recall and anything purchased prior to April 15 is not affected.

The recall comes after the company found out that some of its chocolate shell topping bottles were mistakenly filled with Heath topping. Heath topping contains almonds and therefore the affected bottles contain an undeclared allergen. Tree nuts like almonds are classified as one of the Food & Drug Administration's ""Big Eight"" allergens along with milk eggs peanuts fish crustacean shellfish wheat and soy.

Those bottles in question were shipped to retailers nationwide between April 15 and May 3 2021 so if you purchased Hershey's shell topping before April 15 you're in the clear. Once the issue was noticed Hershey let retailers know that the affected bottles should immediately be removed from shelves.

To see if the topping you may have in your possession is good to go be sure that it doesn't have a product code of 25JSAS1. The recall only includes Hershey's chocolate shell topping and does not have an effect on any other products in the Hershey portfolio.

No illnesses or injury related to the recall have been reported at the time of publication. The situation was an isolated error at a contract manufacturing facility and was immediately addressed to ensure it doesn't happen again. If you have the recalled item in your possession dispose of it as soon as possible and contact Hershey at 1-866-528-6848 for a full refund.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA1L2hlcnNoZXlzLXJlY2FsbHMtY2hvY29sYXRlLXByb2R1Y3QuaHRtbNIBWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA1L2hlcnNoZXlzLXJlY2FsbHMtY2hvY29sYXRlLXByb2R1Y3QuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hershey’s recalls chocolate product,"STATEN ISLAND N.Y. -- Hershey issued a voluntary recall of a single lot of Hershey’s Chocolate Shell Topping the company announced this week.

The products -- which are sold in a 7.25-oz. (205g) bottle with UPC (346000) -- are being recalled after learning that 1700 bottles were incorrectly filled with Heath Shell Topping made with almonds said Hershey.

“Hershey is initiating the voluntary recall to protect public health. People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to almonds run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products” said Hershey.

The products were shipped nationwide between April 15 and May 3 2021 and bear the product code 25JSAS1.

Hershey’s Chocolate Shell Topping products purchased before April 15 2021 are not included in this recall. No other Shell Topping flavors or products distributed by Hershey are involved in this situation the company said.

Hershey has instructed all retailers that received the affected product to immediately remove it from store shelves.

There have been no reports of illness or injury to date. The situation arose due to an isolated error at a contract manufacturing facility and immediate steps were taken to prevent recurrence according to Hershey. The company said it is conducting this recall with the full knowledge and cooperation of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Whether it’s a feeling of isolation from the pandemic's limited social interaction or challenges with finding child care new parents are finding a variety of difficulties that come with parenting during the pandemic.

According to the State of Babies Yearbook 2021 report — an annual snapshot of how infants toddlers and their families are faring by the national nonprofit Zero to Three — families of young children were one of the groups hardest-hit by COVID across the nation. The report looked at how each state's parents of infants have fared during the pandemic considering criteria such as how many were low income child care services and the percent that had health care.

Nationally more than half of families who reported having low income before COVID-19 lost income during the pandemic and the U.S. ranked 33 out of 38 countries when it came to childhood poverty according to the report.

Some mothers in Oregon said while they didn't struggle with poverty because of the pandemic it has made it harder to maintain a reasonable work schedule and to connect with and get support from family and friends.

“It’s been a lot different than we expected” said Albany resident Jennifer Kelley who had her first child Clara in May. “Other than maybe through phone calls and text messages and occasional video calls we haven't really had a lot of family or friend interaction.”

Kelley 34 said it wasn’t until a couple of months ago when vaccines became more available that family members began to come by to help the couple with their daughter.

Some pandemic positives

On the second Mother’s Day since the pandemic began mothers acknowledged there were some positive aspects to lockdown as well getting to spend more time as they work from home and getting to witness their infant’s development firsthand.

“It’s been great for nursing and I’ve gotten to experience milestones that I’m sure I’d have missed if I’d been working in the office” Kelley said. “I think it’s really allowed me to bond with her more.”

In the Zero to Three study Oregon compared favorably to the nationwide averages and was given the report's highest of the four-tier rankings ""working effectively"" meaning the state has a higher level of investment in services and systems for babies.

The report found that Oregon parents were more likely to read or sing to their baby every day one of the study's key indicators of positive early learning experiences.

The state's infants and toddlers also were more likely to be born into a family that wasn't in poverty and were slightly more likely to have health care — 4.3% of Oregon infants did not have insurance lower than 5.1% nationwide. Oregon infants also had a lower mortality rate with 4.2 deaths per 1000 births versus 5.7 nationwide.

Oregon had fewer infants and toddlers living in economically disadvantaged households than the national average. The study found nearly 35% of Oregon's infants and toddlers live in households with incomes less than twice the federal poverty line (about $51500 for a family of four) compared to 40% nationally.

But the report also found that Oregon lagged behind the nation when it came to categories such as babies receiving vaccinations — 65.6% received recommended vaccines compared to 72.8% nationally — and mothers' mental health. Nearly 27% of mothers in Oregon reported having ""less than optimal"" mental health compared to 20.3% nationwide.

For Kelley a major challenge has been the couple lost their waiting list spot for day care when the pandemic hit requiring her and her husband to shift their work schedules in order to care for their daughter.

Kelley works as a disability services coordinator for Polk County and now works remotely from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. while her husband works in-person at a manufacturing company from 3 p.m. to midnight.

“We don’t really see each other except for on weekends” Kelley said. “We only have like a 15-minute window when I’m trying to wrap up my day and I’m also watching her. It's been really nice having her be able to be with us. But at the same time it's been really straining on our relationship.”

Socialization stress

Sabrina Hershey Black a 39-year-old who lives in Eugene had her second child in March. A major issue for her has been deciding when it’s OK to introduce her new baby to friends or family and trusting that it’s safe to do so during a pandemic.

“To have somebody over you have to ask so many more questions” she said. “You're like ‘Yeah so are you comfortable wearing a mask? Can you do all these things?’ If you can't do all these things then it’s about making that right decision for your family and balancing the social connection with making sure that you're keeping everyone healthy right? It’s a tricky line right now.”

Hershey Black has a small circle of close friends and some family members who are allowed to come over to help with raising her youngest child Oakes.

“I definitely appreciate those times when people are able to come over and hold the baby while I take a shower nap or do things around the house” she said.

While many families have been stuck at home there are still organizations helping parents connect in a virtual format. Since the pandemic began the Eugene organization Parenting Now which provides parenting education and support to families with young children has shifted its offerings to an online format.

Parents are looking forward to being able to meet again in-person said Shaya Mooney a program manager for Parenting Now's First Three Years Program. But she said it's also been satisfying to see parents still be able to socialize and discuss parenting virtually.

The program which has so far served 116 families in the 2020-21 fiscal year offers parents an opportunity to socialize over Zoom where they are joined by a Parenting Now educator and discuss parenting and other topics.

""We're all really pleased and thankful to see that there is some connection that happens over Zoom"" she said. ""They're coming together with this commonality so they hit it off.""

For other parents they said the virus-related fears of introducing their new babies to family members has led to some contentious moments.

Salem mother Nicole Hochspeier for example said she has several family members who chose not to get a COVID-19 vaccine leading her to decline offers for them to visit her new son.

“They’ve been told that they’re choosing not to meet him” Hochspeier said. “He’s going to be 8 months old and he’s really vulnerable to potentially getting the new variant of COVID.”

While Hochspeier and her husband have been cautious about going out of the house and meeting new people she’s eager for a time when it’s safe to take her son to parks so he can socialize with other kids.

“I just want to take him to a play structure like to go out and have fun and see other kids playing” Hochspeier said. “Even just going to watch other kids play and see those interactions that's exciting for me because seeing him learn and grow is huge.”

So far Hershey Black has also been cautious avoiding taking her new son to parks or shopping.

It also was a difficult when she had her baby in March she said given that her mom and sister from the East Coast couldn’t fly out to spend several weeks visiting like they did during her first son’s birth.

“I know it’s sad for them since they wanted to see the baby” she said.

CEO Dan Henry told CNBC that the company was planning a change to further embrace remote working as a lifestyle even after the pandemic.

“I want the best and brightest people we can find to join our team to help us be successful and you can live anywhere you want” Henry said according to CNBC. “I’m not Jamie Dimon I’m not going to force you to take the train three hours a day.”

By referencing Dimon Henry was speaking of the comments made by the J.P. Morgan Chase CEO who is summoning U.S. employees back to offices this month. Dimon has also expressed frustrations with the limits of teleconferencing.

Companies particularly tech giants have been moving out of California partly driven by the remote-work lifestyle that has now made it less important to keep paying rent in expensive cities.

Others that have moved include Oracle Palantir and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.

Green Dot according to CNBC will focus on four hubs including the new headquarters in Texas along with WeWork-style offices in Florida Ohio and California.

Henry added that the company would not be saving much from a tax perspective from the move. He said Texas was a “business friendly state” compared to California. He added that local rules could dictate how the company chooses board members.

Henry said it was “more important to be productive than be busy.”

“If you force people to come to an office every day then everybody’s going to try to be busy” he said according to CNBC.

Texas has had a burgeoning tech sector for some time including startups there raising $1.3 billion in funding through March 11. That funding demonstrates Texas gaining on Silicon Valley in terms of investments.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Sun Development and Management Corporation is aiming to develop a stylish new Tapestry Collection-branded hotel in Music City.

Located on the site of the former Johnstone Supply building in Nashville this 181-key newbuild will rise 11 floors high and incorporate a retail and restaurant space on the ground level.

A brand-new development for Nashville

Concept and exterior design plans for this ambitious scheme were approved by The Metro Development and Housing Agency Design Review Committee in 2019.

At the time Nashville Post reported that the developer planned to create the property at 501 Third Avenue South in Rutledge Hill following the demolition of the former Johnstone Supply building at the south-west corner of the Third Avenue South and Peabody Street intersection. According to the article Sun Development paid US$4 million for the 0.6-acre site in 2017 and enlisted Civil Site Design Group Nashville for land development consulting planning and civil engineering.

Design-led hospitality

Ratio Architects has been brought in to come up with the new hotel’s architecture and Manuel Zeitlin Architects is overseeing the design of the building’s interiors. As a Tapestry Collection by Hilton hotel the property promises to connect guests with the locale through its unique style and vibrant personality.

This forthcoming hotel will form part of the SoBro neighbourhood. The scheme which is being developed in partnership with Buffalo Lodging Associates is expected to reach completion in the first quarter of 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2ZvcmJlcy1nbG9iYWwtcHJvcGVydGllcy8yMDIxLzA1LzA5L2ludmFkZXItd2FzLWhlcmUtdGhlLXN0b3J5LWJlaGluZC1vbmUtb2YtdmVuaWNlcy1tb3N0LXJlY29nbml6YWJsZS1ob21lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Invader Was Here: The Story Behind One Of Venice's Most Recognizable Homes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-global-properties/2021/05/09/invader-was-here-the-story-behind-one-of-venices-most-recognizable-homes/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2ZvcmJlcy1nbG9iYWwtcHJvcGVydGllcy8yMDIxLzA1LzA5L2ludmFkZXItd2FzLWhlcmUtdGhlLXN0b3J5LWJlaGluZC1vbmUtb2YtdmVuaWNlcy1tb3N0LXJlY29nbml6YWJsZS1ob21lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Santa Barbara County Fire said the water was calm that night but temperatures were still in the mid-50s and the men were not wearing wet suits.

As they attempted to maneuver their boat the two found themselves pushed further and further from shore up to about 300 yards before a passerby saw the struggle and contacted County Fire for help around 2 a.m.

The fire department responded with two water rescue units three engines one truck and one battalion chief. An AMR ambulance was also dispatched to the area.

Honeywell's strategy is to invest in Internet of Things technology and data analytics to become a go-to software provider for building operators helping clients track operations and providing software that indicates how they can become more efficient. For example with smart sensors and thermostats Honeywell's software can track how much energy a building uses to run air conditioning when no one is inside and suggest it adjust its schedule accordingly.

Last week Honeywell transferred its stock listing from the New York Stock Exchange to Nasdaq signaling its new identity as a tech company. The shift in strategy reflects an attempt by the century-old industrial giant to cash in on the recurring revenue and higher profit margins that are hallmarks of subscription-based software firms.

The pandemic has boosted interest in Honeywell Forge — its analytics and applications platform — as businesses sought out ways to remotely monitor buildings with minimal staff on-premise according to Que Dallara CEO of Honeywell Connected Enterprise the company's software unit. The company's building management sales saw a 6% bump year-over-year as of last quarter according to its latest earnings report.

""In the OT space there's a desert of what's available"" Dallara told Insider. ""We're very interested in the industries we know and the companies we know.""

Honeywell has acquired more than two dozen companies in the past decade as part of its shift to software and has ramped up acquisitions since the onset of the pandemic. It acquired Ballard Unmanned Systems and Rocky Research in October and two months later it purchased life sciences software company Sparta Systems for $1.3 billion and the visitor log software firm Sine for an undisclosed amount. This year it bought communications firm Fiplex. Dallara said those companies' technology will be used to build out Honeywell Forge for a broader range of functions.

""We acquired some great teams and great technology"" Dallara said. ""We're building out our spaces application that helps people return to site and return to stadiums and return back to life.""

While the pandemic led to increased interest in industrial software Dallara said Honeywell is convinced clients will keep investing in the technology even as lockdowns come to an end.

""These are the same types of problems that the industrial world has had to deal with since God was a boy"" she said. ""It's not a walk through parks and gardens: It's an industrial site.

The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) said its decision to wield the stick on First Bank and its holding company FBN Holdings Plc was in the interests of its minority shareholders and depositors.

“The sacking of the board was done in order to preserve the stability of the bank so as to protect minority shareholders and depositors” according to a media briefing by CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele.

Prior to CBN’s sack of the board it had directed First Bank to recover the loan it had granted to Honeywell Nigeria Plc a company owned by the former chairman of FBN Holdings Plc Oba Otudeko or face appropriate regulatory measures for insider borrowing.

According to a report the loan was to the tune of N75 billion but the annual or interim reports of Honeywell Nigeria Plc did not reveal the total amount the company owed the bank.

It stated that Honeywell’s current portion of its loan to First Bank is N13.5 billion including the overdraft facility of N2.9 billion. However CBN alleged that First Bank gave special treatment to Honeywell Flour Mills by restructuring its loan facility.

First Bank Nigeria’s oldest lender has over 31 million customers with deposits of N4.2 trillion and also accounts for a 22 per cent share of the country’s instant payments processing capacity.

Otudeko used his FBN shares as collateral

Since 2016 First Bank non-performing loans when compared with its Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) was beyond acceptable standards according to the CBN.

CAR is the measure of the capital that banks have to protect customers’ deposits. When it is less than non-performing loans it means that the bank’s liabilities are greater than its assets.

According to data from Nairalytics FBN Holdings had recorded a total loan impairment of over N565 billion between 2016 and 2020 while N376.4 billion accounting for more than half the total loans impaired was provided for in 2016 and 2017.

In its statement the CBN stated that First Bank might have collapsed were it not for its regulatory forbearance a financial term for softening some of the strict rules that banks must comply with if they were to avoid being taken over by the CBN.

First Bank’s bad loan ratio improved to 7.7 per cent in 2020 compared to 20 per cent in 2018 following the restructuring and write-offs of corporate debts.

It also revealed that First bank was yet to perfect its claim on the shares of Otudeko in FBN Holdings which he had used as collateral for N75 billion loan to Honeywell Flour Mills -against the precedent conditions before the company’s credit facility was restructured by the bank.

This indicates that First Bank did not have a binding document filed with the CBN that would allow it to legally claim the collateral if there was a default on the loan.

The CBN also alleged that First Bank gave special treatment to Honeywell Flour Mills by restructuring its loan facility and might not have performed its due diligence in securing the collateral for the credit facility.

Otudeko is the current chairman of Honeywell Flour Mills Plc having served as Chairman of First Bank until 2010 and was the immediate past Chairman of FBN Holdings Plc at the time the loans were issued.

He was also named Chairman of Bharti Airtel Nigeria after the Group was acquired by Zain in 2010 using his Airtel shares and some of his Honeywell assets as collateral to secure the credit facility from First Bank.

The Airtel shares were also used as collateral for Honeywell’s N5.5 billion loan secured from Ecobank in 2013 which is currently the subject of litigation at the Supreme Court.

CBN had asked First Bank to divest its interests in Honeywell Flour Mills Group and Bharti Airtel Nigeria Ltd because the Airtel shares were part of the collateral Otudeko had used to get the Ecobank loan.

A failed transition

The Board of Directors of First Bank had removed Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer Adesola Adeduntan and appointed Gbenga Shobo as CEO designate without regulatory approval from the apex bank.

The CBN faulted the appointment of Abdullahi Ibrahim as deputy managing director as well as the appointment of Ini Ebong Segun Alebiosu Seyi Oyefeso and Bashirat Odunewu as executive directors.

The move was flagged by CBN which stated that the bank had no reason to sack its board because Adeduntan’s tenure had not yet run out and there was no notification from First Bank to the CBN about the transition.

“The attention of the CBN has been drawn to media reports that the Board of Directors has approved the removal of the current Managing Director of the bank Sola Adeduntan and appointed a successor to replace him.

“The CBN notes with concern that the action was taken without due consultation with the regulatory authorities especially given the systemic importance of First Bank Ltd” Emefiele said in his briefing.

Adeduntan who was due to retire in December this year was forced out against the wishes of the CBN which warned the board it would take disciplinary action if the move wasn’t explained.

The apex bank decided to reinstate Adeduntan having worked with him since 2016 to restore the bank to a healthy position after it accumulated bad loans that threatened its existence. It also named Remi Babalola as Chairman of FBN Holdings and Tunde Odukola as the chairman of the banking subsidiary.

The board tussle for control could slow down the bank’s recovery in recent years which has seen an improved threshold in its CAR from 15.5 per cent in 2019 to 17 per cent in 2020.

During the 2008/2009 global financial crisis the CBN invoked its powers to remove bank executives when it sacked nine CEOs of banks that were under-capitalised.

Also the regulatory bank in 2016 sacked top executives of Skye Bank over capital adequacy issues having in 2015 given three commercial banks time to recapitalise after they failed to hit a minimum capital adequacy rate of 10 per cent.

Underhand dealings

Under a revised Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act CBN has the power to acquire the shares of any failing lender to the level that guarantees its control of the bank.

Since 2016 CBN has considered First Bank a systemically important bank and has been supported to help it reduce its bad loans.

Director-General of Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry Muda Yusuf who spoke to The ICIR said insider trading was unethical especially when it compromised corporate governance.

“If there is any system that needs tight supervision then it is the financial system. It’s not like the manufacturing sector where if a manufacturing company goes under then the shareholders bear the brunt but for example a bank may have a capital base of N5 billion and depositors base of N1 trillion.

“I think using insider information to trade is unethical because there is likely to be a compromise in corporate governance as the ethical is likely to become blurry” he said.

Otudeko is alleged to have obtained billions of unpaid loans in First Bank and had to be controlled by the CBN through Adeduntan according to the CBN governor.

“The insiders who took loans in the bank with controlling influence on the board of directors failed to adhere to the terms for the restructuring of their credit facilities which contributed to the poor financial state of the bank “Emefiele revealed.",,,,,,,,,

The supply of hotels affiliated with international brands across Latin America has historically been low but investors now have growing interest in conversions as more owners understand the importance of branding according to executives speaking at the recent Hotel Opportunities Latin America conference.

They always thought their brand was more important than an international brand"" said Ricardo Mader Rodrigues CEO of Colliers Market Intelligence and Advisory. ""They see now the difference of how a strong brand [and] all the benefits they bring [can make a difference].

""We're seeing a lot of owners finally understanding the value of the brand"" he said. ""It's a great moment for franchising. It's a big change and I believe that the next few years are going to see an increase of brands in the region to franchise.""

Decoding Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power and Portfolio Quality: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's strength lies in its high-quality portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels primarily operating under the prestigious Marriott and Starwood brands. This association with renowned brands enhances the company's market presence and customer loyalty. The strategic focus on urban and resort properties in key markets positions Host to capitalize on high-demand segments driving revenue per available room (RevPAR) and maintaining a competitive edge.

Financial Robustness: The company's financial health is underscored by its strong balance sheet and revenue growth. The 6.5% increase in total revenues and the expansion of the operating profit margin reflect efficient cost management and an ability to drive top-line growth. The 13.5% increase in EBITDAre further demonstrates Host's operational efficiency and its capacity to generate cash flow which is crucial for reinvestment and shareholder returns.

Strategic Asset Management: Host's recent divestitures and acquisitions indicate a proactive asset management strategy. By selling off non-core assets and investing in strategic properties such as the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown Host is refining its portfolio to focus on high-potential markets and properties that align with its growth objectives.

Weaknesses

Net Income Decline: Despite revenue growth Host Hotels & Resorts Inc experienced a 6.5% decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to translate revenue increases into net profit consistently. It is essential for Host to analyze the underlying causes such as potential increases in operating expenses or one-time charges and address them to ensure sustained profitability.

Dependence on Brand Partners: The company's significant reliance on Marriott and Starwood brands while a strength also poses a risk. Changes in the relationship with these brand partners or shifts in their strategic direction could impact Host's operations and market positioning. Diversifying its brand portfolio could mitigate this dependence and spread operational risk.

Impact of Strategic Shifts: The recent sale of international joint venture interests and other U.S. properties may lead to short-term disruptions and a potential loss of revenue from those assets. Host must manage these transitions effectively to ensure that the long-term benefits of these strategic moves outweigh the immediate impacts.

Opportunities

Market Recovery and Demand Growth: As the economy recovers from the pandemic and travel demand rebounds Host Hotels & Resorts Inc is well-positioned to benefit from increased occupancy and average daily rates. The company's focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels which are expected to see a faster recovery presents an opportunity to capture a larger market share and drive revenue growth.

Strategic Acquisitions: Host's recent acquisitions demonstrate its ability to identify and capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. The company's strong balance sheet and access to capital allow it to pursue further acquisitions enhancing its portfolio and geographic diversity and positioning it for long-term growth.

Operational Excellence: Host's operational efficiency as evidenced by its improved EBITDAre provides an opportunity to further optimize costs and enhance profitability. Continued focus on operational excellence can lead to sustained improvements in margins and cash flow generation.

Threats

Economic Uncertainty: The potential for an economic recession coupled with high inflation and rising interest rates poses a threat to the hospitality industry. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc must navigate these macroeconomic challenges which could impact travel demand and the company's financial performance.

Geopolitical Risks: Geopolitical tensions and international conflicts can affect global travel patterns and have a direct impact on Host's operations. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to mitigate the effects of such external risks on its business.

Competition and Market Saturation: The luxury and upper-upscale hotel segments are highly competitive with new entrants and existing players vying for market share. Host must continue to innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive position in a potentially saturated market.

In conclusion Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) presents a strong financial and strategic profile with robust revenue growth a high-quality portfolio and a proactive approach to asset management. However the company must address the decline in net income manage its brand partner dependencies and

May 9 2021

Story By Mike McGlothlin

The lone engine option in Ford’s Ranger has everything we’ve come to expect from the EcoBoost line including that meaty low-rpm torque curve. However its factory 270 hp rating makes it the most docile version of the 2.3L EcoBoost Ford offers. Time to improve on that… One phone call to the folks at Gearhead Sales and you’ll get a quick education on just how easy it is to transform your midsize pickup into a 13-second terror. With three simple changes you can add 60 hp (at the wheels) to your late-model Ranger’s bottom line.

Using Gearhead’s in-house 15000 series DynoCom chassis dyno we’ll show you what a cat-back exhaust system a recalibrated ECU and a turbo upgrade can do on a late-model Ranger. Things get started with the stock ECM calibration and a ’19 model equipped with a cat-back exhaust system. Then tuning is introduced followed by Gearhead’s turbo magic. Your Ranger’s path to the 13’s starts here.

We Like Ford’s 2.3L EcoBoost But…

There’s a reason Ford offers the 2.3L EcoBoost in so many models (the Mustang Explorer Focus ST Lincoln Corsair and Lincoln MKC among them): the aluminum block and head four cylinder packs a serious punch given its limited size. When you factor in high compression a turbocharger an intercooler and direct injection you get a highly efficient package that’s capable of turning out more than 2 horsepower per cubic inch. Perhaps the tamest of the 2.3L EcoBoost can be found in the Ranger but it still belts out 270 hp at 5500 rpm—along with a load-moving 310 lb-ft of torque at just 3000 rpm. However for some (including us) that just isn’t enough.

SCT BDX Programmer

Gearhead’s 2.3L EcoBoost tuning for ’19 and ’20 model year Rangers is available on both SCT and HP Tuners devices. The latest hand-held (and mountable) programmer from SCT the BDX performance programmer can be uploaded with custom tuning files within minutes via WiFi. You can also view virtually any powertrain parameter the truck’s ECU keeps tabs on read and clear diagnostic trouble codes and even data log with the BDX device.

Another Gateway

Tuning your Ranger by going the HP Tuners route calls for the use of its MPVI 2 flash tool. With an ability to communicate with the stock ECU your custom calibration is downloaded onto the MPVI 2 and then uploaded into the ECU. Regardless which upload device you choose the tuning files are the same and Gearhead prides itself on giving you added power without sacrificing drivability or emissions compliance. The company’s tuning gives you a linear throttle feel and a power curve that builds progressively. This means your vehicle will run and drive like stock—until you use more of the accelerator.

+35 HP On Tuning

While obtaining the baseline horsepower and torque numbers (light green lines) the truck was equipped with a cat-back exhaust but with the factory ECU calibration still in the mix very little added power would’ve been on tap due to the exhaust system. However once tuned the higher-flowing exhaust system likely complemented the tweaked ECU calibration. Full disclosure the dyno read 10-percent friendly the day these results were recorded (most ’19-’20 Rangers dyno 245 to 255rwhp stock) but even with higher baseline figures than what some dynamometers show the power gains and overall before and after results are still relative. Once Gearhead’s ECU calibration was uploaded and dyno’d a 35hp gain was observed along with an additional peak torque number of 45 lb-ft. Another important bit of information is that all dyno runs were made on 93 octane. EcoBoost Rangers can make as much as 15-to-20 percent less horsepower on 87 octane.

Stock ECU + cat-back exhaust: light green

Tuned ECU + cat-back exhaust: dark green

Factory Turbo Upgrade

With the factory turbocharger pushed to the edge of its map Gearhead began experimenting with a few things and eventually settled on this: its upgraded 2.3L turbo. Specifically the compressor wheel is upgraded for more airflow—and we’re told it pushes the factory-based turbo to its safe limit (the turbine/exhaust side becomes too restrictive after this point). Compressor wheel specs and other tweaks are proprietary for now but the upgrade was good for 25 more hp over tuning alone in Gearhead’s testing. The turbo upgrade runs $950 and carries a $900 refundable core charge.

+60 HP Over Stock

Upgraded turbo in place Gearhead’s Ranger test mule was fired up once again and placed under load on the dyno. This time it responded with 25 more peak horsepower produced at a slightly higher rpm (blue line) and more available torque from 3000 rpm through 6400 rpm. According to the guys at Gearhead with the stock turbo still on the engine the optimum shift point (for providing maximum acceleration) is 5600 rpm. But after the turbo upgrade full-throttle shift points occur between 6100 to 6200 rpm depending on the specific gear change.

Full Sleeper Mode

We know not everyone that owns a late-model Ranger heads to the drag strip with it but for some perspective we’ll illustrate what Gearhead’s gains would mean at the track. It’s fairly well documented that a stock Ford Ranger can cover the quarter-mile in 15 seconds flat. With a cat-back exhaust system and Gearhead’s tuning alone you can get into the low 14’s. Throw in Gearhead’s turbo upgrade and you’ve got high 13-second potential. Imagine it: running neck-and-neck with a 3600-pound Mustang yet still being able to enjoy four-wheel drive tow whatever you need to and haul cargo in the bed!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGVib29rY2hlY2submV0L0hQLTE0cy13aXRoLVJ5emVuLWluLXJldmlldy1DaGVhcC1sYXB0b3AtZ2l2ZXMtYXdheS1wb3RlbnRpYWwuNTU4NDk3LjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP 14s with Ryzen in review: Cheap laptop gives away potential,"The plastic chassis looks pleasing due to the thin aluminum plate on the base but this does not help the stability: The light chassis is only fairly torsion-resistant and movements on the hinge warp the adjacent area of the construction.

The model can be upgraded there are two RAM sockets an M.2 2280 slot for the SSD and an M.2 2230 for the WiFi chip. We would throw the latter out first due to the poor result in the test.

But the layout actually makes a lot of sense for a car as obsessed with size and weight as a Lotus.

This Seven fitted with a turbocharged 13B rotary engine from a Mazda RX-7 is featured by Nicole Johnson on her new YouTube channel. And it couldn’t be much farther from her regular driving preferences because when she isn’t hosting this channel Johnson is driving the Scooby-Doo Monster Jam truck.

Hardly surprising then that she thinks the Seven drive like a go-kart. Even for someone who isn’t used to driving something that weighs 12000 lbs (5443 kg) like Johnson this Seven is light. Weighing in at just 1350 lbs (612 kg) wet we think it would please Lotus founder Colin Chapman whose company built the Seven between 1957 and 1972 before selling the rights to Caterham.

With the boost turned up owner Jim Cuba says the engine will churn out about 400 hp at the wheels. That gives it a power-to-weight ratio of 666 hp per U.S. ton. By comparison a Bugatti Veyron makes about 480 hp per U.S. ton.

As Cuba points out the rest of the car is a bit of a mishmash of parts. With the engine transmission and rear axle coming out of an RX-7 the front brakes from a Miata and some Triumph parts in there for good measure it’s safe to say that it’s a special car to drive. Cuba might want to bolt on the front fenders next he goes for a drive though."

But to make this real it'll have to find manufacturing partners to bring the tech to market.

The new manufacturing technology featuring components called nanosheets increases chip performance 45% or reduces power consumption by 75% compared with the one used to make IBM server chips or Apple's iPhone chips IBM said Thursday. The company expects the technology to arrive in processors in 2024 or 2025 two generations beyond the most advanced processes currently used by today's manufacturing leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing or TSMC.

The same basic chipmaking technology that's been used for decades underlies IBM's approach: a carefully arranged pattern of light beamed onto silicon wafers to etch patterns that become the data-processing circuitry elements called transistors. Continuous refinements have let chipmakers gradually shrink those transistors so that processors once used in room-size mainframes can now power a smartwatch.

The new method uses two structures. The first are nanosheets the thin flat wires that carry electrical current across the transistor. Second is a new design for the gate the transistor component that switches that current on or off. IBM uses gate-all-around technology that completely surrounds each nanosheet with the gate material to keep electrical current from leaking.

""We have the transistor device to make it happen and we are seeing the performance improvements"" said Dario Gil head of IBM Research which licenses its chip technology for manufacturers to use. ""The entire industry is going to use this transistor technology.""

Chip progress is important. Cutting power usage is critical for battery-limited mobile devices as well as improving performance makes apps faster and more powerful. Shrinking transistors means more circuitry for faster graphics AI processing and other dedicated hardware abilities.

2nm manufacturing process

The company on Thursday showed off silicon wafers studded with rectangular chips using the new approach. IBM Research is building the test chips at its semiconductor research facility in Albany New York a choice that will likely sit well with politicians eager to restore US chipmaking prowess.

Chipmakers refer to their manufacturing processes by the super-small dimension of nanometers a billionth of a meter. A strand of DNA for example is 2nm wide. For chipmaking a smaller nanometer number indicates progress in miniaturization though the terms used today are largely labels rather than actual measurements.

Today's most advanced manufacturing is TSMC's 5-nanometer process. Much of the industry still uses 7nm or earlier processes. Next in line is 3nm. IBM labels its new process as 2nm. Each step on this path is called a manufacturing node.

Since we're running out of nanometers it isn't clear what labels will come next especially since the numbers are no longer true measurements.

Gil suggested that perhaps we'll switch to angstroms -- a unit of measurement that's one tenth of a nanometer. But he laughs about the idea since the label now is divorced from true measurements.

""The number of the node ceased having meaning since 65nm"" Gil said. ""Ever since then all it really means is the name of the next node two years later.""

Other chipmakers already working on gate-all-around

What isn't clear is how the technology will come to market since IBM no longer makes its own processors.

With a stack of tiny flat wires called nanosheets IBM Research promises chips with faster smaller components that use less power. IBM Research

The world's three major chipmakers -- Intel TSMC and Samsung -- all have their own research programs and likely already are working on gate-all-around technology said David Kanter principal analyst at Real World Insights. ""Every major player clearly has plans for this.""

Samsung showed off its gate-all-around technology at a February conference and Intel like IBM is working on stacking multiple layers of nanosheets into each transistor.

IBM has partnerships with major chipmakers though. Samsung builds IBM server processors and an IBM research alliance is part of new Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's plan to turn around Intel's years of problems.

Another complication for IBM will be proving its technology works outside of a lab in high-volume manufacturing where costs and consistency are crucial.

""For semiconductor manufacturing simply doing the R&D and proving it out is quite a bit different than proving that it scales"" Kanter said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZ2lzdGVyY2l0aXplbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9JQk0tY3JlYXRlZC1hLW1pY3JvY2hpcC1vZi1qdXN0LTItbmFub21ldGVycy10aGUtMTYxNjA3MTYucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IBM created a microchip of just 2 nanometers the smallest yet.

These processors aren’t just for laptops anymore—they’re used in your car your thermostat your refrigerator and microwave.

And the pandemic has revealed just how deeply our dependence runs.

A global shortage of computer chips brought on by vacillating demand and supply chain issues is currently rippling through device-makers of course but also makers of cars vacuum cleaners and stove vents.

Clearly we’re hooked.

So perhaps it’s no surprise that when companies announce better faster more efficient computer chips the world takes notice. This week it was IBM’s turn to make headlines.

The company once synonymous with all things computing announced that it’s demonstrated a 2-nanometer (nm) chipmaking process for the first time.

In a press release IBM said the new process would yield some 50 billion transistors on a chip the size of a fingernail. It would also bring chips that are 75 percent more efficient or 45 percent faster than today’s 7-nm chips.

On its face it would seem IBM just leapt far ahead in the race for top chip tech. Intel’s latest chips use a 10-nm process and TSMC’s use a 7-nm process. And the company has made some very cool and notable progress here. But comparing chips is complicated. So it’s worth dissecting the news a bit more to better understand the bigger picture.

Nanometer to Nanometer Is Apples to Oranges

Progress in computer chips has long been measured in nanometer-sized steps. Each step down yields ever more components—most notably transistors—packed into the same area. And there was a time in decades past when the nanometer nomenclature actually did match the size of certain chip elements. But that time has passed. As chip technology advanced the measurements of chip components decoupled from each generation’s naming convention.

By the time chips made the last big leap to FinFET—a 3D transistor design shaped like a fin—a little over a decade ago the industry’s node number was virtually meaningless. It didn’t relate to any dimension on the chip. There’s currently a debate over what new number or combination of numbers better reflects progress. And although this too is proving rather complicated one spec experts propose is transistor density per square millimeter.

To see how the old naming convention is confusing compare Intel’s 10-nm chips with TSMC’s 7-nm chips. The two actually have roughly equivalent transistor densities with Intel’s 100 million transistors per square millimeter actually edging out TSMC’s 91 million per square millimeter. (Go here for a handy table comparing process size and transistor density of chips.)

IBM didn’t announce transistor density explicitly. But after reaching out to clarify exactly what sized “fingernail” they were referencing—representatives of the company said about 150 square millimeters—the publication AnandTech calculated IBM’s new process would yield some 333 million transistors per square millimeter. Which is indeed beyond anything in production. That said a 3-nm chip TSMC is making for Apple could boast almost 300 million transistors per square millimeter and enter production as soon as next year.

Nanosheets: The Next Step in Moore’s Law?

Perhaps the more significant news is the design of the transistors themselves. IBM’s new technology—called nanosheet or gate-all-around transistors—is the long-awaited successor to today’s FinFET transistors. The company has been working on the tech since 2017.

FinFET transistors consist of a fin-shaped channel surrounded on three sides by a “gate” that controls the flow of electrons. But IBM’s nanosheet (or gate-all-around) transistors have a layered channel instead. The layers are stacked on top of each other and like three pigs-in-a-blanket are surrounded by the gate on all sides. This last bit is the most critical piece. Gate-all-around transistors provide better control of current through the channel prevent leakage and boost efficiency.

“It’s a tremendously exciting technology” Jesús del Alamo a professor at MIT who specializes in novel transistor technologies told Wired. “It’s a completely new design that pushes forward the roadmap for the future.” And while IBM may be the first to show the tech off at this level they likely won’t be the last. Samsung and TSMC will probably follow suit.

It’s too early to make serious performance comparisons between today’s production chips and future chips using IBM’s new transistors but it’s safe to say they’ll offer notable improvements. Dan Hutcheson CEO of analytics company VLSI Research told Wired IBM’s estimated performance improvements actually seemed conservative and called the work a “milestone for the industry.”

Next-Generation Chips

When might you buy a device with one of these chips? Likely not for a bit.

Though IBM still designs chips it sold its chipmaking business in 2014. This new tech hails from its research facility in Albany New York and is a demonstrator not a production-ready chip. In the coming years IBM will complete the process at which point it may make its way into production chips by way of licensing deals with partners like Intel and Samsung.

The industry isn’t likely to stand still in the interim. There’s a renaissance of sorts in the chip industry right now.

It’s no longer only about spending billions to wring a few more drops from traditional chips. There’s energy and innovation reinvigorating the sector and bringing about a Cambrian explosion of bizarre designs for special purposes like AI. And much of it is taking place outside big companies.

For the first time in years venture capital is pouring into startups—more than $12 billion in fact went to over 400 chip companies in 2020 alone.

So even amid this year’s chip drought it seems the monsoon is gathering.

Full-stack quantum computing solutions on the other hand are much more expensive to develop considering the cost-heavy manufacturing of hardware products. They unsurprisingly then seem to be the domain of the big players like Microsoft and a few that are mentioned below. However there are some quantum computing companies offering full stack solutions with neither the financial clout nor the name of Microsoft.

TQD will now list in alphabetical order ten of those which are set to change the game in the full-stack quantum computing sphere. They are — thank goodness — spread across the globe from North America to Europe to China. By limiting ourselves to ten we have of course missed some – you can check out the full list in The Quantum Insider database (see below).

10 Full Stack Quantum Computing Solutions

1. Alibaba Quantum Lab (China)

Founded by Jack Ma in 1999 Alibaba’s core business is in retail e-commerce and the Internet. It also happens to be one of the largest public companies globally.

As far as the quantum computing activity goes a partnership between the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Alibaba Group’s cloud computing subsidiary created the Alibaba Quantum Computing Laboratory. The lab takes advantage of Alibaba’s skill set in cloud computing and algorithms while utilizing the academy’s expertise in quantum artificial intelligence (AI) to create a full-stack quantum computing solution.

Currently Alibaba Quantum Computing Laboratory is researching quantum theory with the idea of creating innovative security solutions in multiple industries i.e data collection and e-commerce.

Definitely a major quantum computing payer in the years to come.

2. Alpine Quantum Technologies (Austria)

Alpine Quantum Technologies’ is a full stack quantum computing solution that has “six decades of worldwide leading-edge know-how on ion-trap quantum technologies.”

With such credentials in the industry it is fingers crossed whether they can make good on their promise and come up with a machine that is cost-effective scalable and more importantly brings quantum information science into a new age of productivity.

An Austrian representative in the quantum computing sector that we expect some exciting stuff from in the coming years.

3. D-Wave Systems (Canada)

A pioneer (supplier of the world’s first commercial quantum computers for instance) and a proven leader in the quantum computing sector D-Wave Systems has been around since 1999 and covers the whole gamut of the development and delivery of the full stack solutions including – quantum computing systems software and services.

D-Wave Government Inc. which is a U.S. subsidiary established in 2013 delivers the company’s quantum computing systems to the US government. Impressively D-Wave’s quantum computing solutions have been used by some of the biggest multinationals on the planet like Google and Lockheed Martin. But that’s not all some top-notch government labs with names such as NASA Ames Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory have availed themselves of the Canadian company’s hardware too.

5. IBM (US)

Another tech giant but with more history than most IBM’s Quantum Composer and Quantum Lab (formerly the IBM Quantum Experience) is an online platform that allows access to cloud-based quantum computing services provided by IBM Quantum through public or premium accounts. Located in a dilution refrigerator at the IBM Research headquarters at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center the quantum processors are made up of superconducting transmon qubits.

So what does the service offer?

Included is access to IBM’s prototype quantum processors tutorials on quantum computation as well as an interactive textbook. As we speak IBM offers over twenty devices on the service though unfortunately only six are free to the public. Here users can run algorithms and experiments explore tutorials if they think you’ve got more to learn and for those more confident amongst us conduct quantum simulations. Circuits can be created in one of two ways: either by utilizing them graphically with the Quantum Composer or programmatically within the Jupyter notebooks of the Quantum Lab. To create circuits the Qiskit program can be compiled down to OpenQASM for execution on real quantum systems.

However there are chances that the transition might be delayed for a few months more until the end of the calendar year.When asked about the ongoing hiring a senior official with IBM’s corporate communications team commented ''Hiring is part of IBM’s Business As Usual (BAU) process. Our workforce decisions are made to best support our clients on their journey to adopting an open hybrid cloud platform and AI capability''.She also shared an FAQ on Kyndril which said “Throughout 2021 and until the spin IBM will continue to invest in Kyndryl to ensure it maintains its leadership position in the market and can capitalize on the changes taking place to innovate in managed services”.“IBM India is expected to open their larger office during Q2 or Q3 of the current financial year. But by the time IBM India will be spun-off into a separate company with a new name. Hence you will in effect not get to see the name IBM on the signboards in Kochi” a source in the know of the things said.The firm already had been using “NewCo” as a placeholder name in their contracts with the external contractors the source said.However the transition might be delayed for a few months more until the end of the calendar year.IBM is already present in Kochi at Centre A Offices a premium business centre on MG Road which houses their coordination office in Kerala with less than five people. Recently the company had listed a huge number of vacancies for Kochi on their website fuelling speculation that the opening of the Kochi office is imminent.According to sources British real estate consultancy Cushman & Wakefield had been in the search for a facility for IBM that could accommodate 400 people initially and then expand to 600 to 800 seats in the future.It was two-and-a-half years ago that IBM first started scouting in Kochi for a property that could seat five to six people. Then they came back again eight or nine months ago leasing a co-working space on MG Road.A search on IBM India’s career page throws back 457 positions in Kochi on their website.“This is part of the company’s expansion into smaller cities – tier 2 & 3 cities – including Kochi” another industry source said.Sources hinted that the company will be opening in Infopark When contacted a senior official with the state government’s technology parks said that IBM might open the office but there are details yet to be worked out.“IBM’s plans are still up in the air. They have already set up a base outside the park [Infopark] a small place and it is not hundred percent clear to me what exactly their plans are” the official said.

Desiccant Air Dryer Market

https://www.orionmarketreports.com/desiccant-air-dryer-market/9365/

Desiccant Air Dryer refers to various types of dryers. Compressed air passes through a pressure vessel with two ""towers"" filled with media such as activated alumina silica gel molecular sieve or other desiccant material. This desiccant material draws water from compressed air through adsorption. When water sticks to the desiccant the desiccant ""bed"" becomes saturated. The dryer is timed to switch towers based on a standard NEMA cycle. When this cycle is complete the system ""removes"" the saturated desiccant bed by simply blowing the water attached to the desiccant using some compressed air.(Get 15% Discount on Buying this Report)A full report of Global Desiccant Air Dryers MarketThe Desiccant Air Dryers key players in this market include:• Atlascopco• Ingersoll Rand• Kaeser• Sullair• Parker• Quincy Compressor• DRI-AIR Industries• Hankison (SPX FLOW)• Gardner Denver• MATSUI• CompAir• FS-Curtis• Star Compare• Rotorcomp• RISHENGBy Type the market is primarily split into• Hot Air Dryers• Compressed Air Dryers• OthersBy Application this report covers the following segments• Commercial Use• Industrial UseScope of the ReportThe research study analyses the global Desiccant Air Dryers industry from 360-degree analysis of the market thoroughly delivering insights into the market for better business decisions considering multiple aspects some of which are listed below as:Recent Developmentso Market Overview and growth analysiso Import and Export Overviewo Volume Analysiso Current Market Trends and Future Outlooko Market Opportunistic and Attractive Investment SegmentGeographic Coverageo North America Market Size and/or Volumeo Latin America Market Size and/or Volumeo Europe Market Size and/or Volumeo Asia-Pacific Market Size and/or Volumeo Rest of the world Market Size and/or VolumeKey Questions Answered by Desiccant Air Dryers Market Report1.

Crystal Disk Benchmark is used to measure read and write performance through sampling of random data which is for the most part incompressible. Performance is virtually identical regardless of data sample so we have included only that using random data samples.

THROUGHPUT

IOPS

AS SSD BENCHMARK VER 1.9

The toughest benchmark available for solid state drives is AS SSD as it relies solely on incompressible data samples when testing performance. For the most part AS SSD tests can be considered the ‘worst case scenario’ in obtaining data transfer speeds and many enthusiasts like AS SSD for their needs.

ANVIL STORAGE UTILITIES PROFESSIONAL

Anvil’s Storage Utilities (ASU) are the most complete test bed available for the solid state drive today. The benchmark displays test results for not only throughput but also IOPS and Disk Access Times. Not only does it have a preset SSD benchmark but also it has included such things as endurance testing and threaded I/O read write and mixed tests all of which are very simple to understand and use in our benchmark testing.

TxBENCH

TxBench is one of our newly discovered benchmarks that we works much the same as Crystal Diskmark but with several other features. Advanced load benchmarking can be configured as well as full drive information and data erasing via secure erase enhanced secure erase TRIM and overwriting.

REAL WORLD FILE TRANSFER COMPARISON

We have put the Intel D7-P5510 Gen 4 Data Center NVMe SSD beside a few other Gen4 SSDs that we have just retested on the Intel Z590 Gen 4 Bench. Once again we found these significantly higher than testing with the AMD Test Bench so didn’t want to mix and match results.

REVIEW ANALYSIS AND FINAL THOUGHTS

The Intel D7-P5510 is the latest Data Center release from Intel and the first time we have seen one of their Gen 4 SSDs on a Test Bench. In our testing we reached throughput speed highs of 6.65GB/s read and 4.2GB/s write with 633K read and 733 write IOPS at low 4K data transfer. This performance was achieved outside of the environment we expect to see the D7-P5510 running in. Quite frankly fine tuning consumer SSDs for the typical benchmarks is a common practice and one in which we are certain Intel has no interest in.

Intel hasn’t provided MSRP pricing and we wouldn’t expect such for a Data Center SSD. From the pricing we are seeing pre-sale of course this SSD might be just the answer for a reliable and powerful solution for just about anyone looking for value capacity speed endurance and a 5-year warranty to boot. Stay tuned in upcoming weeks as we add some enterprise numbers to this report.

The Tyan Thunder CX GC68A-B7126 is a dual-socket 1U platform. This is also a cost-optimized platform designed to pack more cores into 1U.

Tyan Thunder CX GC68A-B7126

The front of the Tyan GC68A-B7126 has twelve 2.5″ drive bays. Tyan has a newer chassis that can take advantage of more drives by moving functionality to the rack ears (e.g. the power button and USB port) and by using thinner drive trays. This increases density by 20% over ten 2.5″ bay models from previous generations.

Inside we have two Intel Xeon processors or to be more precise 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Ice Lake processors. With this generation we get 8-channel memory per CPU and up to DDR4-3200 support. Here Tyan is utilizing 8 DIMMs per CPU which is one DIMM per channel.

With Intel’s 10nm Ice Lake we get PCIe Gen4 which is exposed via two risers on the rear of the chassis. There is an OCP NIC 2.0 slot as well. This is designed for lower-cost networking than OCP NIC 3.0 slots that are becoming more common.

On the rear we also get redundant power supplies two 1GbE ports an IPMI port two USB 3.0 ports and VGA/ serial. These are accompanied by redundant power supplies.

Final Words

It has been a while since we looked at a Tyan server with an Intel Xeon Scalable solution. As you can tell from the cover photo this will be the next server we review from Tyan. We just did not manage to get it into our Ice Lake launch piece.

You Don't Need An Expensive Laptop For Coding

The Mercury Research CPU market share results are in for the first quarter of 2021 which finds AMD scoring its highest single-quarter market share increase in the server market since 2006 leading to record revenue as it steals more sockets from Intel. Those share gains are isolated though as AMD lost share in the notebook segment and overall market share while remaining flat in desktop PC chips. Those regressions might not be as problematic as they appear on the surface though due to AMD's shift to producing pricier chips that generate more profit. (We have the full breakdown for each segment at the end of the article).



""While we don't often discuss average selling prices we note that this quarter saw unusually strong price moves for AMD -- as AMD shipped fewer low-end parts and more high-end parts as well as shipping many more server parts the company's average selling price increased significantly"" said Dean McCarron of Mercury Research.



It's clear that AMD has prioritized its highest-end desktop PC models and its server chips during the pandemic-induced supply chain shortages. These moves come as the CPU market continues to move at a record pace: Last quarter marked the second-highest CPU shipment volume in history second only to the prior quarter. Also the first quarter usually suffers from lower sales volume as we exit the holiday season but the first quarter of 2021 set yet another record - the 41% on-year gain was the highest for the CPU market in 25 years.



These developments benefit both companies but AMD has clearly suffered more than Intel from the crushing combination of supply shortages and overwhelming demand. AMD actually recently lost share to Intel in both notebooks and desktop PCs for the first time in three years but it reminded at a flat 19.3% of the desktop PC market during the quarter meaning it stopped the slide despite supply challenges.



However Intel's Rocket Lake processors landed right at the end of the quarter and they're particularly competitive against AMD's Ryzen 5000 in the lower end that tends to move the most volume. Additionally these chips are widely available at retail at very competitive pricing while AMD's chips are still a rarity on shelves at anywhere near the suggested selling price. That will make the results of the next quarter all the more interesting.



Both Intel and AMD set records for the number of units shipped and revenue during the quarter for mobile chips. AMD couldn't stop the slide in notebook PC chips but as McCarron points out the company has prioritized higher-priced Ryzen ""Renoir"" 5 and 7 models while Intel has grown in its lower-margin and lower-priced Celeron chips. AMD slipped 1 percentage point to 18% of the notebook PC unit share.



Most concerning for Intel? It lost a significant amount of share to AMD in the profitable server market. AMD notched its highest single-quarter gain in server CPU share since 2016 at a growth of 1.8 percentage points bringing the company to 8.9% (a few caveats apply listed below).

While a 1.8 percentage point decline doesn't sound too severe it is concerning given the typically small changes we see in server market share. Intel's data center revenue absolutely plummeted in the first quarter of the year dropping 20% YoY while units shipped drop 13% but Intel chalked that up to its customers pausing orders while 'digesting' their existing inventory. However AMD's financial results in which the company's server and semi-custom revenue jumped 286% imply that Intel's customers were actually digesting AMD's chips instead.

AMD's strong gains in server CPU share during the quarter occurred before its newest AMD EPYC Milan chips and Intel's newest Ice Lake chips had their official launch but both companies began shipping chips to their biggest customers early this year/late last year. Additionally samples of these chips are in customers' hands long before general availability so large volume purchases are often decided long before server CPUs hit the shelves.



AMD's big supercomputer wins with its EPYC Milan chips foretold strong buy-in from those seeking the highest performance possible and it appears that momentum has carried over to the broader server CPU market. Given that most of these customers already know which company they'll use for their long-term deployments it is rational to expect that AMD's server charge could continue into the next quarter.



Finally AMD lost 1 percentage point in the overall x86 CPU market share receding to 20.7%. Again this comes as the company struggles from pandemic-induced supply chain shortages that it is minimizing by prioritizing high end chips. Meanwhile Intel is leveraging its production scale to flood the lower-end of the market and gain share but that comes at the expense of profitability.

Below you'll find the specific numbers for each segment complete with historical data.

AMD vs. Intel Server Unit Market Share Q1 2021

AMD bases its server share projections on IDC's forecasts but only accounts for the single- and dual-socket market which eliminates four-socket (and beyond) servers networking infrastructure and Xeon D's (edge). As such Mercury's numbers differ from the numbers cited by AMD which predict a higher market share. Here is AMD's comment on the matter: ""Mercury Research captures all x86 server-class processors in their server unit estimate regardless of device (server network or storage) whereas the estimated 1P [single-socket] and 2P [two-socket] TAM [Total Addressable Market] provided by IDC only includes traditional servers.""

""I basically came very close to dying"" he says.

Known as ""the most photographed man on Wall Street"" Tuchman has an amazing expressiveness that tells you instantly if stocks are up or down. He contracted COVID-19 early on and has had health issues ever since. Tuchman didn't return to the trading floor full time until November.

Since the stock market reopened its iconic trading floor last May after a temporary closure it has operated with a skeleton crew on-site.

Starting Monday that will change. If 100% of a firm's traders are fully vaccinated it can start sending more of them back to the floor. They will be able to eat lunch in their booths again. Masks will be optional in some parts of the floor.

For Tuchman this is another step forward on the path to normalcy. ""We as the ones who are still left here are significant and relevant and important"" he says.

The exchange is an outlier

The New York Stock Exchange stands out among its rivals. These days most markets don't have trading floors; they are all-electronic. Last week the CME Group announced it won't reopen most of its trading pits in Chicago which it closed during the pandemic.

In 2020 when the New York Stock Exchange decided to send its traders home there was speculation it could portend a permanent change.

""Many of us thought well maybe they'll take the opportunity to get rid of it once and for all"" says Joel Hasbrouck the Kenneth G. Langone professor of business at New York University. ""But they didn't. They brought it back.""

He says there continues to be an argument for having a traditional trading floor. It can make complicated transactions easier and there is a benefit to conducting some negotiations face to face.

Stacey Cunningham the president of the New York Stock Exchange embraces its status as an outlier.

""It's absolutely true that you can run a market without a trading floor"" she says. ""The difference is you get a much better result when you combine people with technology in a well-integrated way.""

And that's the pitch she and her colleagues make to companies that are considering selling stock to the public.

The lure of the iconic bell

Cunningham also likes to play up the institution's long history. The familiar loud ringing of a big bell signals the opening and closing of the day's trading. The New York Stock Exchange's website points out that the ringing of the bell — the ding ding ding played up by TV news — is more than just a colorful tradition that started in the 1870s. It is critical to the orderly functioning of the marketplace assuring that no trades take place before the opening or after the close of the markets.

The sound of the bell was even trademarked with an expert describing it this way:

""The sound of a brass bell tuned to the pitch D but with an overtone of D-sharp struck nine times at a brisk tempo with the final tone allowed to ring until the sound decays naturally. The rhythmic pattern is eight 16th notes and a quarter note; the total duration from the striking of the first tone to the end of the decay on the final one is just over 3 seconds.""

The bell is part of the pomp and ceremony that comes with an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Executives of companies have always crowded onto a small balcony overlooking the trading floor and they'd ring the opening bell on the day their stocks first started trading. These days there are no crowds and executives often appear via video link.

But companies are eager to restart the tradition and Cunningham says she expects the exchange will welcome them back into the building soon.

Cunningham doesn't expect everyone to return immediately and despite the change in rules she believes traders will come back to the building gradually.

""One of the guiding principles that we've had throughout this process was to react to local conditions and increase and ease restrictions as those conditions change"" Cunningham says.

This past weekend Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the positivity rate in New York City has dropped below 1.5% and almost half of New York state's adult population has been fully vaccinated.

The logos of China Mobile China Unicom and China Telecom displayed on mobile phones. /VCG

Three Chinese telecommunications companies' American Depositary Shares (ADSs) will be delisted by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) after they unsuccessfully appealed the move.

China Mobile China Unicom (Hong Kong) and China Telecom said on Friday in separate filings to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that they expect the NYSE to notify regulators of their delisting.

The move will be effective 10 days after the exchange files a Form 25 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission according to the filings.

The delisting stems from investment restrictions put in place by former U.S. President Donald Trump targeting Chinese technology firms.

The NYSE said in January after some flip-flopping that it was determined to remove the three companies' shares.

The three companies filed with the NYSE a written request for a review of the determination on January 20 2021 soon after Joe Biden took office. But the exchange affirmed the determination on Thursday.

U.S. President Joe Biden has left the rules in place amid continuing tensions between the world's two largest economies despite objections from businesses.

The delisting impact on the three telecom companies would be quite limited given their small amount of U.S.-traded shares according to the China Securities Regulatory Commission.

China Mobile's ordinary shares held in the form of ADSs amounted to approximately 2 percent of its total issued share capital as of December 31 2020; for China Telecom it's about 0.14 percent as of Thursday; for China Unicom (Hong Kong) it's roughly 0.2 percent at the end of April 2021.

In their filings China Mobile China Unicom (Hong Kong) and China Telecom reiterated that they have complied strictly with U.S. laws and regulations since their listing on the NYSE in 1997 2000 and 2002 respectively.

Spotify's billionaire CEO Daniel Ek who revolutionised on-demand music listening for millions of people is a resilient entrepreneur from a Swedish working-class suburb who now hopes to bring his business acumen to ""the beautiful game"".

The 38-year-old known for his no-nonsense attitude has offered to buy Premier League club Arsenal amid supporter backlash against unpopular American owner Stan Kroenke.

Ek co-founded Spotify with Martin Lorentzon in 2006 and the company which made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange in 2018 now has a market capitalisation of $56 billion.

Bald bearded and a casual dresser usually seen in sneakers T-shirt and a blazer Ek is known for his reserved style and pragmatism -- a shy problem-solver with a creative streak who takes long walks to think things through and who prizes collective teamwork over the individual.

Ek got into computer programming as a young kid and was a dollar millionaire by the age of 23 when he sold his online advertising company Advertigo in 2006 for a reported $1.25 million.

""But he's more of a businessman than a tech nerd"" Sven Carlsson co-author of ""The Spotify Play"" told AFP painting him as a visionary.

""He's always thinking six months ahead. He's not into the details. He's known for having ambitious lofty goals with no understanding for how unrealistic they are"" he said.

""He thinks big and he has patience"" to see those projects through to fruition.

Ek was raised in Stockholm's working-class suburb of Ragsved. His father left the family when Daniel was young.

""He's always had something to prove... Being left by his dad was a formative experience"" Carlsson said.

Pelle Snickars co-author of ""The Swedish Unicorn: the story about Spotify"" describes Ek as ""quite Swedish in terms of values"".

""We don't see him on magazine covers alongside celebrities he's not hierarchical and does not hesitate to showcase his collaborators"" Snickars told AFP.

With around 9 percent of Spotify's capital and 37 percent of voting rights Forbes put Ek's fortune at an estimated 4.8 billion in April 2021.

- Spice things up -

In 2006 Ek and Lorentzon came up with the idea of creating a platform to distribute music online legally a practice that at the time was dominated by illegal file sharing sites.

The duo experimented with sharing mp3 music files between the hard drives on their computers. In October 2008 Spotify was finally ready to go live after Ek pleaded with music labels to open their catalogues.

""Innovations are never entirely new"" Ek told the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm during a 2013 visit.

""The success comes from combining things that already exist and trying to solve a problem that one is really involved in"" he added.

Ek reportedly dropped out of the university's engineering programme to pursue an IT career -- though his enrolment at the school has never been proven Carlsson noted.

He said Ek's former colleagues nicknamed him ""Spice"".

""They thought he always spiced up his stories a little to make them more interesting"" Carlsson said adding that it wasn't necessarily a bad thing.

""Storytelling is something Spotify and Daniel Ek have always been good at.""

- Football next? -

Ek's perseverance may have led to the remarkable rise of the start-up but artists have over the years complained of it paying them too little and cannibalising sales from their albums.

Ek has repeatedly argued that streaming is a better alternative for artists and that ""piracy doesn't pay (them) a penny -- nothing zilch zero"".

Snickars and co-author Rasmus Fleischer dispute the idea that Spotify was founded to end piracy and force consumers to pay for music.

They claim that neither Ek nor Lorentzon ""had any experience with working professionally with music"" but they had a common background from digital advertising.

""They weren't particularly interested in music...they could have worked on skin products instead"" Snickars told AFP.

Now Ek is ready to dive into the football arena.

""As a kid growing up I've cheered for Arsenal as long as I can remember. If KSE (Kroenke Sports Enterprises) would like to sell Arsenal I'd be happy to throw my hat in the ring"" Ek wrote on Twitter on April 23.

Kroenke has however insisted Arsenal is not for sale despite growing supporter unrest at the American billionaire's ownership of the club whose last Premier League title came in 2003/04.",,,

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in the press release that we issued yesterday. With me on the call today is our CEO Erik Fyrwald and our Executive Vice President CFO and Business Transformation Officer Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions you have at the end. With that I would now like to turn the call over to Eric.

Erik Fyrwald: Well thank you Mike and hello everyone. I’m excited to join you all today to discuss our solid performance in the first quarter and what we are seeing across the business so far this year. Today we’ll focus on our financial results our outlook for the balance of the year and our increased confidence in our reiterated guidance where we now see us trending toward the upper end. Now before moving forward I want to acknowledge Glenn who today is announcing his plan to retire at the end of 2024 after three successful years with the company. During his tenure Glenn has driven multiple actions to improve our balance sheet and position the company for financial success. We’ve benefited from his experience and commitment to transformation and his ongoing leadership to position IFF to drive long term profitable market share growth.

He’s also been very helpful to me already as I’ve come on to the IFF team. Now with this announcement we have started a succession plan to evaluate internal and external candidates to succeed Glenn. The board and I are grateful for all Glenn has helped IFF accomplish and look forward to his continued leadership as we identify a successor and ensure a smooth transition. Now turning to Slide Six we are off to a good start at IFF. We achieved volume growth for the first time since the first quarter of 2022 as volumes grew mid-single digit in the first quarter of 2024 with strong contributions from scent nourish and health and biosciences. We are also encouraged by the double digit comparable adjusted EBITDA growth as we not only benefited from volume growth but also from productivity gains across our businesses.

At the same time we made important progress focusing our portfolio with closing the divestiture of the cosmetics ingredients business and the announced sale of our Pharma Solutions business. We expect to complete the Pharma transaction in the first half of 2025. The proceeds from these divestitures will help further strengthen our capital structure address our deleveraging goal of three times net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA and refocus us on high growth areas of our business. With our solid performance in the first quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year we are cautiously optimistic about the remainder of 2024 and now expect full year 2024 results to trend toward the high end of our previously announced guidance ranges.

It’s still early in the year and there is a lot more work to be done but we are focused on building on our momentum to energize our team and return to sustainable profitable growth. Turning to Slide Seven let me take a step back for a moment and share what I’ve learned during my first 90 days here at IFF. I’ve spent time getting to know our teams all over the world and meeting with many of our customers and I’m grateful for the productive discussions and what I’ve found is that IFF has lots of top talent and incredible innovation capabilities but we’re not yet realizing our full potential. With a new leadership perspective on our priorities and a renewed focus on execution by our executive leadership team we are getting back to basics and I’m optimistic about what we will do from here.

First we are strengthening our balance sheet and capital structure to create the flexibility we need to achieve our long term goals. My assessment is we have not consistently delivered on our financial commitments largely due to a need for more strategic and organization operating model clarity to enable us to better execute against our goals. I think we are now getting the clarity we need and have taken some decisive steps in the first quarter to help us start to realize more of our potential. We recently rightsized our quarterly dividend to align with the market and our long term cash flow generation and have made divestiture moves including cosmetics and pharma solutions to focus our portfolio and drive debt reduction. We also recently announced and are implementing our refocused IFF operating model which is now business-led supported by lean functions.

This includes the appointment Ana Paula Mendonça who has dedicated her career to the advancement of fragrance at IFF as the President of Scent. This enables Simon Herriott to focus his full attention on driving profitable growth in our health and biosciences business unit. We will also put more focus on our flavors and functional ingredients units within our nourish division. With this operating model change we have also changed the reporting structure of several of our functions including R&D operations finance and HR to go directly into our business unit presidents so they have the full end-to-end responsibility and accountability for business execution. Their goals will include delivering growth above market with a margin structure that gets us in line with or better than leading peers.

Now to make this work we have also established an operating system which is a simple set of management processes that collectively define how IFF makes decisions and creates value provides a framework for standardized processes responsibilities and metrics and defines the tools to help managers drive continuous improvement. We believe this will create greater visibility to track performance so we drive execution to deliver results in the current period in ways that strengthen us for the coming years. We are also introducing an operating philosophy based on four main pillars; number one customer focus to drive profitable market share growth; number two innovation powerhouse to create sustainable new products and other innovations customers value and do this faster; number three operational excellence to lead our relentless focus on safety quality continuous improvement and competitive cost structures and four; people people who are engaged across the organization.

We expect that our business-empowered model and operating system will enhance collaboration to profitably win with customers and by doing so deliver strong financial performance over time and while it’s still early I am pleased and encouraged by the energy and commitment of our teams all around the world. With that I’ll now pass it over to Glenn to dive deeper into our results for the first quarter. Glenn?

Glenn Richter: Thank you Eric and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Eric mentioned earlier we’re encouraged by the momentum across our business as we start the year and we are excited to continue to build on these positive early signals throughout 2024 and beyond. In the first quarter IFF generated roughly $2.9 billion in sales. On a comparable currency neutral basis. Sales increased 5% year-over-year. Our strong quarterly revenue performance was led by mid-single digit volume growth with sequential improvements across most of our businesses including scent health and biosciences and nourish. Pricing was modestly positive inclusive of FX-related pricing in emerging markets in particular the Argentine Peso where we like the industry have indexed pricing to US and or Euro exchange rates that drive pricing changes.

Absent of this benefit pricing would have been negative in the quarter largely in line with our plan. We delivered strong profitability in the quarter with adjusted operating EBITDA of $578 million. This represents a 20% increase on a comparable year-over-year basis led by volume growth and the contribution from productivity initiatives. As a result margins improved by approximately 310 basis points to nearly 20% adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Turning now to Slide Nine I’ll dive deeper into the business performance across our segments. In nourish sales increased by 3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis with strong double-digit growth in flavors with improvements in both volume and price and we saw very strong growth in our flavors business across nearly all markets.

Functional ingredients volume was up low single digits the first time since the fourth quarter of 2021. Overall comparable currency neutral sales declined year-over-year due to our planned pricing actions. In terms of profitability productivity gains and volume growth drove a 13% increase in comparable adjusted operating EBITDA with solid gross margin improvements in both flavors and functional ingredients. Our health and bioscience segment had another strong quarter with both top and bottom line growth. Solid performance in our H&B portfolio led by double-digit sales growth in cultures and food enzymes animal nutrition and grain processing and mid-single digit growth in home and personal care drove a 6% increase in comparable currency neutral sales.

Improved volume and productivity gains led to a 21% increase in year-over-year comparable adjusted operating EBITDA. Scent delivered another excellent quarter including 16% growth in comparable currency neutral sales driven by double digit growth in consumer fragrance and fragrance ingredients and mid-single digit growth in fine fragrances. Segment also excelled in terms of profitability primarily led by volume growth and productivity improvements which delivered an outstanding adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 55% on a comparable basis. Lastly in pharma solutions while we saw some improvements from productivity initiatives these were offset by lower volumes driven as expected due to continued destocking trends which began late last year.

It’s worth noting that part of the destocking trend in the first quarter was market related and the other is due to Pharma Solutions initiative to reduce reliance on distributors and convert more of its core excipients business into a direct distribution model. We believe the shift to a more direct approach will enhance our customer relationships reduce supply chain complexity and provide greater access to technical resources while also improving margins. Also as mentioned we agreed to divest the Pharma Solutions business as part of our portfolio optimization efforts and are confident the business will be positioned to thrive and succeed in partnership with Roquette. Now on Slide 10 I’d like to discuss our cash flow and leverage position.

Cash flow from operations totalled $99 million this quarter while CapEx was $118 million or roughly 4.1% of sales. In the first quarter normal seasonality impacted our free cash flow results. As a reminder Q1 is usually the lowest cash flow quarter of the year as we make annual cash bonus payments in March. Our free cash flow position totalled negative $19 million in the quarter versus negative $48 million in the year ago period. We also paid $207 million in dividends through the end of the first quarter. Our cash and cash equivalents totalled $764 million including $32 million in assets held for sale. IFF continues to make progress in our deleveraging efforts and reduced our gross debt by almost $1 billion versus year ago for a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.4 times at quarter end.

Our trailing twelve month credit adjusted EBITDA totalled approximately $2.2 billion. Please note that the proceeds from the sale of LMC of $810 million were received in April and consequently not reflected in the quarterly results. With the announced Pharma Solutions transaction we are confident that we will achieve our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA target of three x following the transaction close which we expect will be completed in the first half of 2025. On Slide 11 I’d like to now turn to our outlook for 2024. Based on our improved financial and operational performance in the first quarter and our expectations for the balance of the year we remain cautiously optimistic about the year ahead and as Eric mentioned now expect results to trend towards the higher end of our previously announced guidance ranges.

This reflects our belief that volumes will also be towards the high end of our previously announced 0% to 3% with improving trends across the majority of our portfolio. We also saw pricing increases due to FX-related pricing in emerging markets in the first quarter and therefore raised our previously announced pricing guidance to approximately 1% for the full year 2024 versus previous expectation that pricing would decline approximately 2.5%. With these foreign exchange rate changes we now expect currency will have an adverse impact of 3% to 4% versus 0% to 1% as previously expected on our sales growth which is essentially offsetting the FX pricing contribution. On the bottom line for 2024 we are now trending towards the high end of our previously announced adjusted operating EBITDA guidance range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion.

This assumes continued improvements in volumes as well as strong productivity. While it is still early in the year volume trends are encouraging and consequently we have increased confidence in our ability to achieve our full year guidance. For the second quarter we expect sales to be approximately $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion driven by improved volumes with an adjusted operating EBITDA of approximately $500 million to $525 million. I’ll now turn it back to Eric for closing remarks.

Erik Fyrwald: Thank you Glenn. Now as I shared at the top of the call my first 90 days on team IFF have been energizing as I see so much potential. We have great talent and capabilities across our global teams and our solid top and bottom line results from the first quarter show that we are building positive momentum and it’s an honor to lead IFF during this transformative time and I am encouraged by our positive start to the year and our outlook. Yet we still have a lot of work to do. As the market continues to be very competitive we are committed to bringing products and innovation that differentiate us from our peers and give customers what they need to win and in turn helps them and us drive sustainable profitable growth and with a solid start to the year I’m excited to see what we can accomplish going forward. And with that I’d like to now open it up for questions.

Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin your line is now open.

Matthew Hettwer: Thank you and good morning. This is Matthew Hettwer on for Kevin. It’s nice to see a strong start to the quarter. Eric could you give us some yeah morning. Eric could you give us some additional context and detail regarding how you’ve seen the individual businesses react to your new operating philosophy through the first 90 days?

Erik Fyrwald: Yeah thanks for the question Matthew. As you probably know I’ve been on a listening tour or a discussion tour since right after the January 11 announcement of the change. Am I joining IFF and it’s been really great to hear from our employees all around the world and our customers all around the world. And what I’ve discerned from that is that we’ve had multiple companies coming together with different operating models different philosophies and there was significant uncertainty about the organization structure and how we were going to do things. And what we’ve done is the executive leadership team has come together very nicely. I’m very proud of the team and we’ve been able to together clarify the structure and operational model that we have going forward and the four pillars that we’re focused on to drive our performance.

We’ve had town halls all around the world both live and by video. We’ve touched all our employees. We’ve spent special time with our leadership and I think we’ve gotten really clear on how we’re moving the company forward and what I love about it is I feel the engagement of our people around the world. I feel their energy growing. I think there’s great acceptance and enthusiasm for the empowered business unit model for the focus on customers. The job of all of us is to support our teams to win with customers and help us profitably grow our market share and then also drive our innovation that we’re at the core we’re an innovation company and we need to make sure that we have leading innovation that we’re bringing to our customers and it’s innovation that customers value.

And then finally that we also have healthy productivity productivity that helps us strengthen the company and invest more in growth and innovation and doing that with smart productivity things like reducing consultants reducing layers driving functional shared service centers where it makes sense using technology information technology. So my feeling is that there’s great capabilities great people in this company and the executive leadership team is coming together to try and do all we can to unleash that full potential of our people all around the world.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas. Nicola your line is now open.

Nicola Tang: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Firstly Eric you talked there about the changed operating model. Can you talk a little bit about portfolio and following the announcement to divest Pharma Solutions do you intend to pursue any further divestments or is that it for now. And then if I could squeeze in another one for Glenn on cash flow are you still confident in your free cash flow target of $500 million a year or $700 million on an adjusted basis? And is there potentially upside given the upward revision or the high end that you see in terms of the EBITDA guidance and could you explain what drove the increase in trade receivables in the quarter? Thanks a lot.

Erik Fyrwald: Okay I’ll start and then hand it over to Glenn. And thanks for the question Nicola or questions. So on the portfolio first of all the Pharma Solutions business will be with us for another year and we see a lot of opportunity to further strengthen the performance of Pharma Solutions over the next year and then beyond that with Roquette. But then we have the other four business units that we’re going to really focus on driving forward. Of course with Nourish both the flavors and the functional ingredients we have the scent business and we have the health and biosciences business. All our focus now is on supporting those businesses to perform well to drive profitable market share growth to drive healthy productivity to make sure that we’re bringing leading innovation and deliver the best performance we can in the second quarter full year 2024 but do it in ways that strengthen us for ’25 and beyond.

We’re also going through a strategy review process for each of the businesses and we’ll take a look at what it takes to win in each of those businesses in the coming years and what we have to do investment wise and making sure that each of the businesses has the right portfolio to win going forward. So you’ll hear more about that in the coming quarters and years but right now our focus is all on making sure we’ve got the right strategy the right capabilities in each business the right collaboration culture across businesses and are winning with customers by bringing leading innovation. Glenn?

Glenn Richter: Thanks Eric. Thanks for the question Nicola. We’re actually trending more favourable in terms of our full year outlook for free cash flow and adjusted as well. As you mentioned a combination of earnings momentum actually working capital is actually performing better than planned and we expect actually some improvement and then just some timing on taxes. We’re probably going to be closer to $600 million versus the $500 million. I would note that that also includes higher Reg-G costs related to pharma. So we gave you a $200 million number in Feb that did not include pharma for obvious reasons. The heavy lifting as Eric mentioned is the balance of this year separating systems legal entities etcetera. That’s roughly about $100 million. So on adjusted basis $900 million on a free cash flow reported basis directionally $600 million. Thanks for the question.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Josh your line is now open.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWZsYXZvcnMtaWZmLXRvcHMtcTEtMjEzMDA0Mjc0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,International Flavors (IFF) Tops Q1 Earnings and Revenue Estimates,"International Flavors (IFF) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.13 per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.84 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.87 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 34.52%. A quarter ago it was expected that this ingredients producer for food cosmetics and consumer products industries would post earnings of $0.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.72 delivering a surprise of -4%.

Over the last four quarters the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.

International Flavors  which belongs to the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry posted revenues of $2.9 billion for the quarter ended March 2024 surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.35%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.03 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

International Flavors shares have added about 7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.5%.

What's Next for International Flavors?

While International Flavors has underperformed the market so far this year the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s) but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release the estimate revisions trend for International Flavors: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Story continues

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.89 on $2.76 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.68 on $10.91 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank Consumer Products - Staples is currently in the top 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Another stock from the same industry Chewy (CHWY) has yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2024.

This online pet store is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.21 per share in its upcoming report which represents a year-over-year change of +5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

Chewy's revenues are expected to be $2.87 billion up 2.9% from the year-ago quarter.

Even though their personalities are wildly different (especially our first two) they all have a planetary influence in common that gives them extra-good fortune. Consider me jealous AF.

When it comes to “luck” and the zodiac there’s one big player we always have to keep an eye out for: Jupiter. This giant planet embodies everything about luck—when I’m reading someone’s astrological chart I always look at their Jupiter placement to get insight into how good (or bad) their inherent fortune might be. For example if someone’s natal Jupiter lands in the sign of Gemini I might assume/intuit that their fortune will come from being social and outgoing.

Because he controls cosmic luck Jupiter is reflected in each of these three lucky signs. The first sign I’ve chosen as the luckiest is directly ruled by Jupiter (Trust me this sign is a blast to keep around!). The second luckiest sign was once ruled by Jupiter but now claims Neptune as its home planet. And the final (Wild card!) lucky sign helps exalt Jupiter—a little more about that below.

Remember – just because your sign doesn’t show up on this list doesn’t mean that you’re not blessed with good fortune. We aren’t only our sun signs—we’ve got the influence of all the other planets in our chart.

Hint: if your natal Jupiter falls in any of these signs….lucky you!

Sagittarius

Sagittarius is THE luckiest sign in the zodiac. I’ve always been in awe of how much Sagittarians can get away with. They are the stereotypical wanderers and adventurers of the twelve signs and have great luck catching their flights just in the knick time or finding a travel buddy on a moment’s notice.

Sag is a mutable sign which means they know how to go with the flow but they also have serious drive (Thanks fire element!) which helps fuel their lucky streak. Sagittarians don’t just let luck come to them—they work for it.

Pisces

Pisces has to be the second-luckiest sign in the zodiac—and they secretly have something in common with Sagittarius. While many modern astrologers believe that Neptune rules Pisces (which is my opinion) ancient astrologers believed that Jupiter ruled this sign.

Because of this Jupiterian influence Pisces are lucky ducks just like Sagittarius. Unlike Sag however Pisces doesn’t use force to gather luck. Rather they use their intuition (Read: magic!) to ride the waves of good fortune.

Cancer

Cancer is the zodiac sign—in my opinion—with the lamest reputation. They’ve (wrongly) developed a reputation for being weepy homebodies. While Cancerians may have strong attachments to comfort and home they’re also great at manifestation and making luck happen!

Their cardinal nature gives them drive and their intuition gives them direction. For an extra boost of luck our friend Jupiter is exalted in the sign of Cancer which means that Jupiter’s energy resonates with the energy of Cancer. Love that for you Cancer!",,,,,,,,,,,,

Roula Khalaf Editor of the FT selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Actively managed exchange traded funds are proving so successful in building scale that they are set to win a greater share of investors’ cash — at the expense of both conventional mutual funds and passive ETFs according to industry figures.

The investment vehicles — which unlike mutual funds are listed on exchanges — still constitute only 4 per cent of the overall ETF market according to TrackInsight a data provider. However its latest figures show this share is increasing rapidly: active ETFs’ assets under management grew 13.7 per cent in the first quarter to reach $318bn. That compares with a 7.3 per cent growth to $8.1tn under management for the broader ETF market.

Industry observers attribute the increase in demand to two factors: new active thematic ETFs such as the suite of products from Ark Invest; and the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval in 2019 of so-called semi-transparent ETFs.

This regulatory change approved several different product structures for active semi-transparent (or non-transparent) ETFs most of which avoid the need to disclose the funds’ direct holdings and instead allow managers to publish a daily proxy portfolio with a similar risk profile. As a result market participants can still get a sense of what is inside the fund but without other managers being able to replicate it exactly.

Proponents argue that this guarded approach prevents other market participants from “front-running” the products — trading assets based on insider knowledge of who else will be buying them.

US investors using these ETFs can also benefit from lower fees and taxes compared with mutual funds.

“Semi-transparent ETFs allowed investors to access strategies that previously might only be available under mutual funds or separately managed accounts” says Giang Bui head of US exchange traded products for Nasdaq.

Yet active transparent and semi-transparent ETFs face challenges and limitations analysts warn.

Active strategies unlike index tracker funds cannot rely on the record of an index to show performance. Instead the managers have to prove themselves independently — a process that takes several years.

“Whenever you launch an active ETF you know that it is not going to be a blockbuster right out of the gate” says Anna Paglia Invesco’s global head of ETFs.

Recent efforts by two US asset managers — DFA and Guinness Atkinson — to repurpose mutual funds as ETFs could be seen as a way of overcoming this issue says Ciarán Fitzpatrick head of ETF servicing Europe at State Street. He adds: “That is an avenue where asset managers are looking at potentially being able to carry their record forward.”

Paglia says there will probably be a mutual funds-to-ETFs migration by investors “where active ETFs are going to play a critical role” she says. “This market is evolving.”

Some believe there is more room for innovation in active ETFs as investors and regulators become more familiar with new products.

Bui argues that expanding the semi-transparent universe to asset classes such as fixed income is the next frontier for the industry.

At present the SEC allows only US equities to be included in semi-transparent ETFs but a global survey published by Brown Brothers Harriman in March which captured responses from 382 ETF investors identified fixed income as the asset class that people would most like to see added to actively managed ETFs.

Meanwhile in Europe where regulators are proving more cautious none of the semi-transparent formats have been approved for use and there is still no clear indication as to when this might change.

Market fragmentation in the bloc poses particular challenges and some believe regulators such as the International Organization of Securities Commissions (Iosco) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) need to adopt a unified approach.

“You need Esma and Iosco to give a blanket approval so that the individual regulators can follow suit” says Fitzpatrick. “I don’t think one regulator approving semi-transparency in one market is going to solve anything.”

However others believe it is just a matter of time before the new vehicles take off in Europe.

“It’s likely a question of when not if active management plays a more meaningful role in Europe” says Todd Rosenbluth head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research. “I think [it will] pick up over the next three to five years.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties including but not limited to the issuer.

DES MOINES Iowa — Monday Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a law changing the way hit-and-run crimes are prosecuted in the state of Iowa.

Emmalee's Law is named after Emmalee Jacobs a young woman from Urbana Iowa who was hit and killed by a CyRide bus driver in 2015.

The law requires a driver to come forward as soon as they realize they may have been involved in the vehicular incident resulting in injury or death.

Previous story:

Mother's day this year was bittersweet for Ann Jacobs. It's the sixth Mother's Day she's spent without her daughter Emmalee who was struck and killed in 2015 while walking to class her freshman year at ISU. But this year a law created in her honor is one step closer to becoming a reality.

Emmalee's Law passed unanimously through the Iowa House Friday after being amended by the Senate. It now moves to the desk of Governor Reynolds.

""It feels good"" said Ann Jacobs of Urbana. ""I mean it’ll never change the fact that she’s not here anymore but I’m glad that it could help other families in the future.""

December 14 2015 CyRide bus driver Benjamin Clague struck and killed Emmalee along his route.

He was arrested more than a month later and charged with failure to obey a traffic sign and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death but there was no evidence that showed he immediately knew he hit her and caused her death.

In 2016 Clague was sentenced to just 30 days in jail. The family saw it as a painful injustice.

According to court documents Clague had texted a friend within hours of the incident telling the friend he thought he had hit someone but there was no way to prove he knew he had hit Emmalee upon impact. It's something that frustrated then-First Assistant Story County Attorney Jessica Reynolds who says on the eve of the trial the court ruled that the prosecution would have to prove that Clague knew he'd hit Emmalee upon impact.

""It was just a horrible legal battle before we went to trial regarding the statute and knowledge requirement"" said Reynolds. ""We could prove that he had knowledge minutes after the impact but the evidence didn't show that he had knowledge at the time.""

Emmalee's Law would change that requiring a driver to come forward as soon as they realize they may have been involved in the vehicular incident resulting in injury or death.

Emmalee's Law named after a freshman ISU student hit and killed by a CyRide bus in 2015 is one step closer to changing the law for hit-and-runs in the state of Iowa. It passed through the Iowa statehouse on Friday and now moves to Reynolds' desk. Story at 10 on @weareiowa5news pic.twitter.com/jyGSbpg5bF — Eva Andersen - Local 5 News (@EvainIowa) May 10 2021

The law reads in part:

If the driver of a vehicle leaves the scene of an accident resulting in injury or death...and later discovers that the driver's vehicle may have been involved in an accident that resulted in injury to or death of a person the driver shall as soon as reasonably possible make a good-faith effort to immediately contact emergency services or make a 911 call.

Emmalee's parents Ann and Brad Jacobs say 18-year-old Emmalee may have been quiet outwardly but those close to her as a kind-hearted smart young woman with a great sense of humor.

""She loved kids"" said Brad.

Emmalee also graduated at the top of her class from Center Point-Urbana High School.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rdHZiLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvb3V0cmVhY2gvc2V2ZW5zLWhlcm8vN3MtaGVyby1ib2lzZS10ZWVuLWhlYXJ0LXRyYW5zcGxhbnQtam91cm5leS8yNzctYjBlMjQ0MWMtNWRjZi00ZjA2LWJiYmUtNWI3NTY2MTVhZDI00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7's HERO: Boise teenager with genetic heart condition undergoes heart transplant in California,"16-year-old Jacob Serre is at Stanford Medical Center after undergoing a heart transplant in April. His mom is always by his side documenting his journey.

BOISE Idaho — Boise teenager Jacob Serre was born with a genetic heart condition. He was just a baby when he was diagnosed with Familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy a genetic form of heart disease.

This condition occurs when the heart muscle becomes thin and weakened in at least one chamber causing the open area of the chamber to become enlarged. This causes the heart to be unable to pump blood as efficiently as usual.

""He was diagnosed at three months old"" said Jinjue Serre Jacob's mom.

Jacob's medical team at St. Luke's Children's Hospital in Boise has been watching him carefully since he was a young boy. He started having more serious issues in January of this year.

""Probably the biggest thing for me was fatigue and getting tired faster than pretty much anyone around me"" Jacob said. ""Legs getting tired arms getting tired and not being able to go as far or do as much.""

Jacob was admitted to St. Luke's hospital on February 28 2021. His condition continued to worsen because his heart was working too hard. After a few weeks Jacob's doctors told his family they were out of options.

""That's when they told us that there was nothing else they could do that he needed to go to Stanford Medical Center in California"" Serre said.

Jacob was in need of a new heart. After being transferred to Stanford Medical Center things moved quickly.

""On March 21 2021 he was flown to Stanford by Air St. Luke's and we have been here since then"" Serre said.

Jacob was listed for transplant on Friday April 2. Jacob's dad Andrew his sisters and little brother stayed in Boise as they knew it could be quite a wait for a new heart to become available.

""Generally you expect to wait a few weeks to a few months at least"" Serre said.

Suddenly the call they were all waiting for came.

""It was a phone call at night and every time my mom got a phone call I tried to listen in"" Jacob said. ""I was just like 'Yeah this is it.' Mom just started crying and said it's time tomorrow morning.""

Imagine your teenage son undergoing a heart transplant. It's unimaginable isn't it? That's just what happened to a Boise mom and tonight they are spending Mother's Day together at Stanford Medical Center in CA. We'll have the inspiring story in tonight's #7sHERO at 10pm! ❤️ pic.twitter.com/L2BKsWjl0F — Maggie O'Mara (@maggieKTVB7) May 10 2021

Serre was overcome with emotion when she told her son the news. She couldn't believe the call actually came.

""We were surprised because it had only been a week"" she said. ""You are just in shock for a while. You are excited but you are in shock and you are thinking about the donor family and there are just so many things in your mind.""

The night before his heart transplant Jacob was nervous and spent most of his time on the phone with his family. It was an emotional night for the mother and son.

""Lots of phone calls and stayed up late tried to sleep but I couldn't"" Jacob said.

Before he knew it morning came and it was go-time. The transplant team was ready.

""I remember getting rolled down to the room vaguely"" Jacob said.

It was tough to leave his mom's side and Jacob's dad was rushing to get from Boise to Stanford Medical Center in time.

""It was really hard"" Jacob said. ""My dad got the soonest flight he could and he was there by the time they opened me up.""

Serre said she gained comfort in the fact that her son was in God's hands and in the hands of the best surgeons in the country.

Hours later the family received some good news from the medical team.

""He did amazing"" Serre said. ""They said he would be intubated for one to three days but ten hours after surgery he was awake and wanting his tube out. He told them to stop the pain meds. He was just taking regular Tylenol he was up and walking by day four. On day six he had all his IVs out was taking all his meds by mouth and he literally got to walk himself out of the ICU so it was amazing.""

The Serres still have a long road ahead of them. Jacob and his mother will be in California living at the Ronald McDonald House for the next several months and they will be in and out of the hospital to make sure Jacob's body accepts his new heart.

Serre updates family and friends on her blog and on her Facebook. Updating everyone on Jacob's condition is somewhat therapeutic for her because she feels she can look back at it later and remember what it was like.

""It's been so cool. This is what social media is for not all the negative things but this is what it should be used for"" she said. ""Being able to put out a post and know that thousands of people are reading it and praying all over the world. We couldn't do this without people we have around us.""

Jacob told KTVB he has been really uplifted by all the comments from home and from afar.

""Yeah I read some of them and I'm just super thankful that we have an amazing community back at home supporting us through all of this"" he said.

Serre said Jacob's attitude through all of this has been incredible and he's simply inspiring to all who know him.

""He's so resilient"" she said. ""We've been in the hospital for two months and he's still happy and takes everything in stride.""

As Jacob adjusts to his new heart and everything that comes with it the donor and the donor's family are always top of mind.

""Obviously it's a huge loss for them but I would like to just have them know there is something good that came out of it"" Jacob said. ""A new chance for me.""

In honor of his donor Jacob plans to make the most of this beautiful chance at a new life. One day he would like to meet the donor's family but that is entirely up to them. The family plans to write a letter to them with the hopes that one day they write back.

""It's amazing that somebody would give him this gift"" Serre said.

Jacob is back in the hospital with some complications but his mom is right by his side and said he is a trooper. The goal is to avoid rejection and get Jacob back home to Boise with his whole family.

ANAHEIM Calif. (KABC) -- A tearful vigil was held in Anaheim Saturday honoring three men killed last week when their car was struck by a vehicle that may have been street racing.

Alexander Smiller 63 of Los Angeles Jacob Rolon 32 of La Mirada and Richard Zuniga 36 of Anaheim were all killed after a Mercedes smashed into their car early Tuesday morning.

Police say the driver and passengers in the Mercedes fled the scene -- but were later found at a local hospital.

RELATED: 3 killed in Anaheim crash

Three men were killed and two women hospitalized in a violent hit-and-run crash in Anaheim authorities said.

Mark Landgreen a family friend of Richard Zuniga was clearly emotional during the vigil.

""It's hard. He loved his daughters. He had two daughters. Landgreen said. ""You can never replace a father no matter what. It's a lot for them to deal with and a lot for the family to deal with.""

Attendees at the vigil say street takeovers and racing are common in that area and they hope that this crash spurs police to crack down on the problem.

A GoFundMe has been established to help the Zuniga family with funeral costs."

The vote to kill the effort was an overwhelming 359 to 43 with seven voting “present.” Democrats flocked to Mr. Johnson’s rescue with all but 39 of them voting with Republicans to block the effort to oust him.

Members of the minority party in the House have never propped up the other party’s speaker and when the last Republican to hold the post Kevin McCarthy faced a removal vote last fall Democrats voted en masse to allow the motion to move forward and then to jettison him helping lead to his historic ouster.

This time the Democratic support made the critical difference allowing Mr. Johnson who has a minuscule majority to avoid a removal vote altogether. While for weeks Ms. Greene had appeared to be on a political island in her drive to get rid of yet another G.O.P. speaker 11 Republicans ultimately voted to allow her motion to move forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21hcmpvcmllLXRheWxvci1ncmVlbmUtYm9vZWQtaG91c2Utc3BlYWtlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Greene booed as Republicans turn on her over bid to oust Speaker Johnson,"They heckled her and shouted boos as she rose to speak and some hissed at her — and those were the voices from the same side of the aisle as Rep.

Marjorie Taylor Greene tried and failed in sudden action Wednesday to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson her long-shot effort swiftly and resoundingly rejected by Democrats and Republicans tired of the political chaos.

One of Donald Trump’s biggest supporters in Congress Greene stood on the House floor and read a long list of “transgressions” she said Johnson had committed as speaker. Colleagues booed in protest.

Greene criticized Johnson’s leadership as “pathetic weak and unacceptable.”

After Greene triggered the vote on her motion to vacate the speaker from his office Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise quickly countered by calling first for a vote to table it.

An overwhelming majority 359-43 kept Johnson in his job for now.

“As I’ve said from the beginning and I’ve made clear here every day I intend to do my job” Johnson said afterward. “And I’ll let the chips fall where they may. In my view that is leadership.”

It’s the second time in a matter of months that Republicans have worked to oust their own speaker an unheard of level of party turmoil with a move rarely seen in U.S. history.

The tally shows the strengths but also the stark limits of Johnson’s hold on the gavel and the risks ahead for any Republican trying to lead the GOP in the Trump era. Without Democratic help Johnson would have certainly faced a more dismal outcome.

All told 11 Republicans voted to proceed with Greene’s effort more than it took to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall a first in U.S. history. And the threat still lingers — any single lawmaker can call up the motion to vacate the speaker.

Johnson said he hoped it “is the end of the personality politics.”

As Greene pressed ahead with the snap vote despite pushback from Republicans at the highest levels including Trump GOP lawmakers filtered towards Johnson giving him pats on the back and grasping his shoulder to assure him of their support.

The Georgia Republican had vowed weeks ago she would force a vote on the motion to vacate the Republican speaker if he dared to advance a foreign aid package for Ukraine which was overwhelmingly approved late last month and signed into law.

But in recent days it seemed her effort had cooled as she and Johnson met repeatedly for a potential resolution.

Johnson of Louisiana marched on saying he had been willing to take the risk to approve the foreign aid believing it was important for the U.S. to back Ukraine against Russia’s invasion and explaining he wanted to be on the “right side of history.”

In a highly unusual move the speaker received a boost from Democrats led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York whose leadership team had said it was time to “turn the page” on the GOP turmoil and vote to table Greene’s resolution — almost ensuring Johnson’s job is saved for now.

“Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems” Jeffries said after the vote.

Trump had also weighed in after Johnson trekked to Mar-a-Lago last month for support the presumptive Republican presidential nominee giving the speaker his nod of approval. And Trump’s hand-picked leader at the Republican National Committee urged House Republicans off the move.

Ahead of House voting Trump said on social media “I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene” but he said Republicans need to be fighting now to defeat Democrats in the November election. He urged Republicans to table Greene’s motion.

“At some point we may very well be but this is not the time” Trump said to oust the speaker.

The move now poses its own political risks for Greene a high-profile provocateur who has moved to the forefront of the party with her own massive following and proximity to Trump.

Greene was determined to force her colleagues to be on the record with their vote – putting them in the politically uncomfortable position of backing the speaker and seen as joining forces with Democrats to save him.

“I’m proud of what I did today” Greene said afterward on the Capitol steps.

While reporters and camera crews crowded around Greene and ally Rep. Thomas Massie R-Ky. a group of other Republicans gathered on the steps trying to shift the attention away from her and make their own views known.

Rep. Dusty Johnson R-S.D. said of those trying to remove the speaker “They’re pretty good at getting attention but they have not been recognized for their ability to get things done.”

He said if they keep pushing to oust the speaker “I think you can expect more of the same: Failure.”

Reps. Carlos Giménez a Florida Republican said of Greene: “She doesn’t represent the Republican Party. I’m tired of of this being the face or the voice of the party and getting attention. That’s all she wants is the attention.”

Rep. Mike Lawler R-N.Y. called for Greene and Massie to be punished for their actions.

Had Democrats not taken the unusual move to help the vote would most likely have ended differently for Johnson who holds one of the slimmest majorities in the House in modern times with no votes to spare.

Last year the House chamber was hurled into chaos when eight Republicans voted to remove McCarthy from the speaker’s office and Democrats declined to help save him.

Ousting McCarthy resulted in a nearly monthlong search for a new GOP leader bringing the chamber to a standstill with an episode Republicans wanted to avoid ahead of the November election.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to boot Speaker Mike Johnson has officially failed after the House voted by a 359-43 margin to table the Georgia Republican's motion to vacate on Wednesday.

11 Republicans sided with Greene voting against a procedural vote to table her motion. Basically they voted to allow a debate on Greene's effort rather than simply quashing it.

Just two other Republicans — Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona — officially cosponsored her resolution.

Seven Democrats voted ""present.""

Greene's move was somewhat of a surprise with the congresswoman forcing the vote just one day after seemingly backing off of her threat.

Former President Donald Trump weighed in shortly after the vote saying that while he ""absolutely"" loves Greene he did not believe House Republicans were ""in a position to voting"" on the ouster bid.

The far-right congresswoman's effort was long expected to fail given Democratic leaders' decision to vote to table the motion. Ultimately 163 Democrats did so.

32 Democrats voted with Greene citing their opposition to Johnson's politics and their belief that Democrats should have asked for more in exchange for their votes.

However I fought a lot to change Pelosi rules and have more accountability on the speaker in Congress so I voted not to table the motion consistent with my vote on McCarthy last fall. — Rep.

His message was broadcast during both ceremonies at Ohio Stadium.

The following is the full text of Dimon’s address:

Thank you President Johnson for the invitation to speak today. Thank you as well to the Board of Trustees and Chairman Gary Heminger.

To the graduating students congratulations. You should be very proud of what you have achieved.

And a very special congratulations to the parents. It probably seems like yesterday that you were holding your child in your arms for the first time. That child has now become a young adult with a college degree and is ready to face the world. All of the family members here today who provided the love and support over the last 20 years should also feel extremely proud of what they helped accomplished.

I wish I could join you in person … because in the Zoom world it’s impossible to replicate the joys of being physically together.

Over the past 20 years I’ve had the pleasure of making multiple trips to Columbus.

The city is always fun to visit and is one of JPMorgan Chase’s most important markets.

It is home to the Chase Innovations Center where we develop our new and nimble mobile and digital products. We also have an office that’s housed in the McCoy Center on Polaris Parkway. It’s bigger than our headquarters in New York. In fact it’s one of the largest offices anywhere in the world.

And here is one other fun fact about Polaris campus: During the pandemic we used the time with little to no cars in the parking lot to install solar panels. In July when it is complete it will furnish about 75% of the power needs of the entire complex.

We employ close to 20000 people in Columbus – making us one of the top private sector employers in the area. And we’re still hiring so if you don’t have a job yet – or even if you do – go to our website and explore the opportunities. We’re always happy to have more Buckeyes on our team.

When JPMorgan Chase enters any community we take great pride in being a responsible citizen at the local level. We serve large corporations and we lend to and support local businesses like Schmidt’s restaurant where I hope some of you will be going for a celebratory meal later today.

Your celebration comes after a year that was extraordinary by any measure. We’ve been through a global pandemic a global recession unprecedented government actions turbulent elections and deeply felt social and racial injustice.

It’s been a time when each of us has faced difficult personal challenges and a number of us lost loved ones. In our country at large those among us with less were disproportionately hurt by joblessness and poverty.

All of you have been affected by COVID-19 in different ways. Your future is bright but as you grow older it’s inevitable that you will face tough times and failure – both personally and professionally. We all do. How you deal with failure may be the most important thing in whether you succeed.

Your graduation here today shows that you had resilience to persevere though a difficult period.

The COVID-19 pandemic of course which has taken more American lives than the total lost in World War II the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined resulting in acute economic distress for millions more.

The murder of George Floyd which highlighted the racial inequities that have been with us for hundreds of years and the racial unrest that followed.

The divisive 2020 presidential election culminating in the storming of the Capitol and raising questions about the functioning of our democracy.

It’s important for all of you to understand this world you’re entering. Today the United States and other countries are grappling with an array of critical issues. To name just a few: capitalism versus other economic systems; access to health care; immigration policy; the role of business in our society; and how or even whether the United States intends to exercise global leadership.

While it is important to acknowledge the issues we face we also need to recognize the exceptional strengths of our country.

We are blessed with the natural gifts of land: All the food water and energy we need …

The Atlantic and Pacific oceans as natural borders …

And wonderful neighbors in Canada and Mexico.

We are also a country based on principles: freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom of enterprise and the promise of equality and opportunity.

These gifts have led to the most dynamic economy the world has ever seen nurturing vibrant businesses large and small exceptional universities and a welcoming environment for innovation science and technology.

America has been and will continue to be a beacon of hope for the world and a magnet for the world’s best and brightest.

We should celebrate America’s exceptionalism while also acknowledging our country’s flaws. You are all lucky to be graduating with a powerful education from a great university but that’s not the case for everyone in our country today.

While the average American high school graduates approximately 85% of its students many of our inner-city schools don’t graduate half of their students and often don’t give our children an education that leads to a livelihood. No one can claim that the promise of equal opportunity is being offered to all Americans through our education systems.

We also need to make our nation’s health care system work better for everyone. U.S. life expectancy has actually declined in recent years which is a product of the health challenges facing this country. And obesity which is a main driver of diabetes cancer stroke heart disease and depression afflicts 42% of American adults as well as nearly 20% of children. This demands far more attention.

We also face significant sustainability challenges. Climate change is a critical issue of our time. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions requires collective ambition and cooperation across the public and private sectors. We have an opportunity to make the world a better place for ourselves for our children and grandchildren and for all the living things that share this planet with us.

One of the keys to meeting these challenges and others will be harnessing the power of new technologies. And we should remember that technological progress while it has some downsides that need to be appropriately managed is fundamental to human progress. Technology has been the driving factor in changing society for the better for hundreds of years: boosting living standards and fostering communication and convenience for people throughout the world.

The role young people can play …

You’re graduating at a moment when there’s great uncertainty in the economy politics and the world at large. But remember that’s always been true – for your parents grandparents and all prior generations.

It’s natural to be a bit intimidated by the uncertainty you do face. But I would urge you to see this as a moment of great opportunity.

Take inspiration from Neil Armstrong an Ohio native who was the first person to walk on the Moon. Fifty years ago he spoke at Ohio State’s commencement and delivered a timeless truth: “Few rewards are as gratifying as discovery.”

As you move into the next stage of your life you’ve probably been warned that college is not like real life. I would agree with that. I’m always hesitant to give advice because it sounds like I did everything right. And I can assure you that I did not. That said let me offer you some advice based on about 40 years in the workplace.

Learning is a lifelong pursuit. It’s your job to constantly learn and it doesn’t end now that you’re college graduates. Regardless of what you do in life to be successful you need continuous learning and endless intellectual curiosity. I still spend about 50% of my time reading and learning. Reading history is fascinating. Shakespeare teaches us about human nature and the morning newspapers keep you informed of current events and the globality of the world.

Reading provides not just knowledge but it teaches empathy how organizations work and how to work with people. And it’s even more important in today’s increasingly complex and rapidly moving world.

The other way to learn and the only other way to learn which gets overlooked these days is by talking to other people – ideally face-to-face. You can learn more from speaking to someone in 15 minutes than if you spend your life doing something. It can be explained to you and you can learn from watching very good people and how they operate in difficult circumstances. I learned a lot of things about what to do – and what not to do – by watching other people.

We all stand on the shoulders of those who came before us. Humility is the realization that those who came before you paved the way. Never fool yourself into thinking that your success is just your own.

Your success is the result of your parents and family who sacrificed to give you a better life your professors and administrators who helped you through your time here at Ohio State your friends and neighbors who looked out for you and encouraged you.

In fact this wonderful country whose bounties we benefit from was built by so many people who made endless and often the ultimate sacrifices … before we were even born. It’s important to respect what they have done and to be grateful for it.

As graduates of this world-class university you each have what it takes to lead meaningful lives and to contribute to the lives of others. Doing that requires a grace and generosity of spirit … it requires compassion and treating everyone with respect … from CEOs to clerks … and it requires giving back.

In the words of the poem that I love by Rudyard Kipling:

If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you. If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue or walk with Kings – nor lose the common touch…yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it.

This is an exciting moment to be a young person armed with a first-class college education. The world is full of opportunity. And you are going to enrich this nation and other nations in many ways.

One hundred years ago Ohio State’s president William Oxley Thompson addressed the graduating seniors and told them something that still rings true today.

College graduates he said are who “this country must turn to for a citizenship that is tolerant but not indifferent; loyal but not bigoted; aggressive but not conceited; alert but not alarmed.”

As you go about your life remember your country. And regardless of what you do and what you achieve in life … try to leave everything and everyone that you touch a bit better than they are today.

And you’ll not only have the kind of life you wish to deserve – you will also do your part to make this country and the world a better place for generations yet to come.

Thank you. Congratulations. Good luck and Godspeed. Keep the faith.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1ZmZwb3N0LmNvbS9lbnRyeS9qYW1pZS1kaW1vbi1qcG1vcmdhbi1iYWlsb3V0LWNvcnBvcmF0ZS10YXgtaGlrZV9uXzYwOTVmYjJhZTRiMGFlM2M2ODdlOTI5NdIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1ZmZwb3N0LmNvbS9lbnRyeS9qYW1pZS1kaW1vbi1qcG1vcmdhbi1iYWlsb3V0LWNvcnBvcmF0ZS10YXgtaGlrZV9uXzYwOTVmYjJhZTRiMGFlM2M2ODdlOTI5NS9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After $12 Billion JPMorgan Bailout CEO Jamie Dimon Doesn't Want Biden 'Throwing Money',"As Americans head to the polls in 2024 the very future of our country is at stake.

""I'm always hesitant to give advice because it sounds like I did everything right"" Dimon said ""but I assure you I did not.""

To start Dimon told the graduates about the importance of learning from failure.

""All of you have been affected by Covid-19 in different ways. Your future is bright but as you get older it is inevitable that you will face tough times and failure both personally and professionally"" Dimon said. ""How you deal with failure may be the most important thing in whether you succeed.""

Throughout his career Dimon has dealt with obstacles himself — in 1998 he was fired from Citigroup by his own mentor after the pair had worked together for 15 years. But two years later Dimon became CEO of Chicago-based Bank One which was later bought by JPMorgan Chase.

Under his leadership JPMorgan Chase overcame the Great Recession and became the nation's largest bank.

""Learning is a lifelong pursuit"" Dimon said. ""It's your job to constantly learn and it doesn't end now that you're college graduates. Regardless of what you do in life to be successful you need continuous learning and endless intellectual curiosity.""

Lifelong learning is important to Dimon he said adding that he spends ""about 50% of my time reading and learning. It's even more important in today's increasingly complex and rapidly moving world.""

Along with reading Dimon urged students to learn from other people and their actions.

""You can learn more from speaking to someone in 15 minutes than spending your life doing something"" Dimon said. ""I learned a lot about what to do and what not to do by watching other people.""

Dimon received his bachelor's degree from Tufts University in 1978 and his master's degree from Harvard Business School in 1982. He also received an honorary degree from Ohio State University on Sunday.

His current net worth is $1.9 billion according to Forbes.

Jamie Dimon keynote speaker and chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase acknowledged graduates’ concerns entering the workforce and relayed hope in a message to students family and friends present in person and online through a livestream at Ohio State’s first in-person commencement since December 2019.

Dimon said given uncertainty in the economy politics and the world at large it’s natural to be intimidated. He said graduates should continue to learn have humility and compassion contribute to the lives of others and give back.

“Your graduation here today shows that you have had resilience to persevere through a difficult period” Dimon said.

The university awarded 12345 degrees and certificates to the class of 2021 Melissa Shivers senior vice president for student life in the Office of Student Life said — including 9240 Bachelors of Associate degrees 1861 Masters 278 doctorates and 986 graduate professional degrees and certificates.

“This is an exciting moment to be a young person armed with a first-class college education” Dimon said. “The world is full of opportunity and you are going to enrich this nation and other nations in many ways.”

Commencement included two ceremonies to adhere to COVID-19 protocols according to the university’s commencement website. Students were emailed ahead of time about safety measures — including mandatory face masks physical distancing a negative-COVID-19 test for graduates in the week leading up to commencement and showing a green status from their daily health check.

Graduates received diplomas on their way into the stadium at preassigned times according to a March press release. The graduates also sat with up to two guests and the groups were 6 feet apart.

University President Kristina M. Johnson said the class of 2021 helped the university tackle challenges of the last year and defines resilience.

“Today we celebrate you the class of 2021” Johnson said. “Because of your persistence and undaunted Buckeye spirit you made it you powered through this year and you are graduating today.”

Johnson said it was the determination and grit of the graduates that enabled the university to remain open this year amid a pandemic undergoing weekly or twice-weekly COVID-19 testing and daily mask-wearing.

“I’m so proud of you. Each of you represents the best of what it means to be a Buckeye” Johnson said. “Nothing deterred you from pursuing your academic degree serving our communities and supporting one another this year.”

Because the ceremony was held on Mother’s Day Johnson recognized mothers’ roles in the graduates’ educational pursuit and lives and paused for a resounding “Thanks mom.”

The university recognized David T. Harrison president of Columbus State Community College and Frederick L. Ransier III a lawyer in Columbus as recipients of the Distinguished Service Award.

The university also granted honorary doctorate degrees to Dimon; Congresswoman Joyce B. Beatty; Robert S. Langer professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and co-founder of Moderna; and Ellen Ochoa a veteran astronaut of NASA.

Johnson asked the class of 2021 to view the honoraries as examples of what they can achieve as college graduates.

“Take the power of your Ohio State experience and diploma and use it to inspire others to see the good around them to make the biggest possible impact you can” Johnson said. “That is the power of this place your place your alma mater — The Ohio State University.”

Amidst the pandemic overwhelming the capacity of many hospital systems malicious hackers have been quick to target healthcare providers and medical agencies. These cyber-attacks have hit both the United States and Europe in recent months serving as a reminder for organizations to closely review their information security posture during these times of uncertainty.

Despite certain attacker groups stating their intent to refrain from targeting healthcare organizations for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis publicly reported cyber-attacks included a ransomware attack on the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District in the United States and the downing of critical systems at Brno University Hospital in the Czech Republic. In addition attacks against the World Health Organization have more than doubled while the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was hit by an attempted DDoS attack.

Attack surface is expanding

Hospitals and healthcare organizations were an attractive target even before the coronavirus pandemic. Patient records have almost everything an attacker needs in a single record to carry out sophisticated insurance fraud schemes purchase medical supplies or drugs and/or commit other types of fraud including outright identity theft. Medical records are lucrative targets and are expensive assets in the dark market.

The deployment of new devices—especially those categorized as IoT that use wireless networks and sensors to collect and exchange information—is a double-edged sword. While these devices offer medical environments tremendous capabilities to care for patients and increase efficiencies each device increases an organization’s attack surface.

Compliance challenges

Adding to the complexity of these security challenges are compliance and regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and NIS Directivethat are typically enacted to protect systems and sensitive data. However since they frequently evolve to keep pace with information technology industry influences and new threats to systems and data healthcare organizations face multiple moving targets for managing controls and meeting requirements.

For example in the UK hospitals and other healthcare entities of the National Health System (NHS) that are using digital services are responsible for ensuring they meet the minimum standards in the areas of network security and data protection.

Requirements for network protection are described in the NCSC Cloud Security Principles and in the 10 steps to cybersecurity guidance. Healthcare organizations can demonstrate compliance with these requirements by taking a self-assessment like the Cyber Essentials.

In the field of data protection healthcare organizations need to comply with the requirements of Data Protection Act of 2018 which transposed GDPR into the UK legislation. To demonstrate compliance hospitals and other NHS entities need to consider the 12 steps detailed by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).

All this said securing patient customer and organizational data must be a top priority. The high price for patient records combined with new and growing vulnerabilities provide a great impetus for cybercriminals to attack.

How to Keep Your Healthcare Organization Safe

There are several key measures to follow that help lower the risks of breaches and keep your company’s and customers’ data safe.

Build a risk-aware culture. This means: Thoroughly examine and determine where security risks lie in your organization. Educate and communicate with employees to help them understand how they can help close the gaps. Implement the right tools that continuously monitor and identify vulnerabilities as well as alert employees so that your organization can act quickly to reduce the risks.

Implement foundational controls and basic security hygiene. According to SANS implementing the first six CIS Controls provide a highly effective and efficient level of defense against the majority of real-world attacks. They also help to create the necessary foundation for dealing with more advanced attacks.

Automate all security and compliance efforts. This helps to: Discover and profile all business-critical assets such as patient care systems medical devices and payment systems. Quickly repair configurations errors. Adjust security controls based on system changes and business impact. Monitor measure and report compliance with security and privacy requirements.

Manage incidents with intelligence to help your organization to respond more quickly. To do this: Implement intelligent analytics to help monitor operations. Implement automated response capabilities. Integrate next generation threat intelligence solutions with change detection for advanced threat detection and response.



Good Security Delivers Effective Compliance

The solution to the unprecedented cyber threat problem that healthcare organizations face is to implement foundational controls that integrate into other solutions to proactively respond to threats. If an organization has implemented good security processes and controls they could be well on their way to meeting multiple compliance and/or security standards.

Tripwire supports many compliance mandates (including HIPAA and FDA) as well as guidelines from NIST. That support combined with Tripwire’s advanced cybersecurity and compliance solutions gives you proven industry-recognized security and the ability to meet almost any compliance mandate. All while helping you detect and respond to any threat to your organization’s—and customers’—data.

Vivek Kalra Director & Head of Telecom India & SAARC Juniper Networks talks about the readiness of India to adopt 5G standards of communication and sheds light on how AI-driven networks will help the Indian telecom operators.









How upgrading to SD-WAN will support Indian enterprises and what will it offer to telecom service providers?

Enterprises across verticals in India have started adopting SD-WAN to overcome the rigidness and shortcomings of their existing WAN deployment. SD-WAN allows enterprises to leverage a combination of transport technologies – including MPLS LTE Broadband & VSAT. This adds operational complexity to SD-WAN.

This makes SD-WAN a very big opportunity for telecom Providers. They are offering SD-WAN as a service by combining connectivity CPEs and life cycle management of the overall solution.

How is 5G going to make a difference in India both from a consumer point of view and from a business perspective?

The 5G era will introduce a wide range of time-critical services for consumers enterprises and government organisations across various sectors in India. Applications built in this era demand data delivery within a specific guaranteed time duration.

For example we will see increased demand for immersive media experiences driven by AR and VR technology which spans both consumer and enterprise use cases. We will also see a rise in remote control operations in various industries as well as unmanned vehicle systems powered by the connectivity that 5G brings.

Are we ready for 5G? Once 5G gets launched who is going to benefit more out of it?

All operators in India are running 5G Trials for various use cases and are gearing up to launch 5G in the next few quarters across big cities. Operators are running Transformation across all aspects of their networks. All decisions of operators across Radio Transport Data-centres & IT are all keeping 5G in mind. 5G has various use cases relevant & beneficial for both consumers and enterprises.

How are AI-driven networks going to help Telecom Operators?

Data traffic has seen explosive growth driven by various applications and use cases. Telecom networks are more critical than ever and have become pervasive in all aspects of our lives. Operators are focused on delivering quality of service’ enhanced customer experience and are keen to add agility and self-healing capabilities in their networks.

AI and automation play a key role there. Automation controls service experience for customers and operations experience for operators. Operators are starting to focus their automation investments in areas of network planning optimisation assurance and operational efficiencies.

India is transforming into a huge market for data centers. How are these data centers evolving and how will it impact the operations of India Inc.?

India has one of the world’s largest telco markets and we have seen some of the biggest industry players here looking to get a slice of the data center market. While we continue to see telcos partnering with global hyper-scalers to offer value-add services and even seen some looking at building their own data center campuses the data center market in India is still in its nascent stages.

To keep up with the explosive growth of data and cloud computing in India data center operators need to rethink their data center operations with a focus on delivering assured experiences. This starts by simplifying operations from design to deployment through everyday operations and assurance with the power of automation.

By building modern automated data centers companies will be in a stronger position to support India’s data center market as well as its digital transformation agenda.

The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a surge in cyber-attacks. How can companies strengthen their IT infrastructures to make them attack-proof?

The threat landscape in India is only growing more complex and sophisticated. Service providers and enterprises alike need to adopt a modern security approach that will not sacrifice network performance and impact the end-user experience.

To achieve this these companies need to look at unifying all network elements into a threat-aware network and adopt a Connected Security Strategy. This approach to network security gives organisations the ability to safeguard users applications and infrastructure.

By extending deep network visibility and security policy enforcement to all points of connection across the network companies in India can better bolster their cybersecurity posture.",,,,,,,,,

A photograph that was circulated on Twitter and Reddit in early May 2021 claimed to show the underside of a Snapple lid with a “Real Facts” factoid that allegedly read “Trump lost and the election was not stolen.”

As some users on Reddit pointed out it appeared as though the “fact” listed on the lid had been photoshopped and a look through the online Snapple real facts database did not return any results matching the image above.

The website listed on the lid (Snapple.eu) led our team to AGBarr the European distributor of the U.S. brand. We contacted Keurig Dr Pepper the U.S. owner of the Snapple brand to confirm whether such a lid had ever been in production and was told that the lid was not an official Snapple ""Real Fact"". Additionally a spokesperson for the company said that the originator of this image confirmed on Twitter that it was digitally manipulated.

Global packaged goods companies sustained solid growth during the first quarter of 2021 rising 4.5% organically. Like other companies in other industries all of them are facing input cost inflation to a meaningful degree and are likely to raise prices for consumers. But as the CEO of Kellogg’s reminded everyone on their earnings call this week marketers can earn price increases by building stronger brands.

Television advertising has been one of the most important vehicles used to build brands; however change is occurring rapidly as illustrated by this week’s results from Roku and other data related to declining conventional pay-TV subscriptions. Whatever vehicles marketers choose to use what matters is that they continue to invest in their brands to better position themselves to earn the price increases they will increasingly need.

—–

Virtually all packaged goods companies have now reported their first quarter 2021 results and input cost inflation remains a key trend. Costs will inevitably be passed along to consumers as the year progresses. Addressing how to deal with this phenomenon on its earnings call this week Kellogg’s CEO said “we have to earn that price in the marketplace through investing in our brands (and) through innovating.” It may seem paradoxical to suggest incurring more cost in order to offset other costs and yet it certainly can work. In an article from Kantar published last year titled “Why pricing power is a brand’s greatest asset” they stated “to justify paying more for a brand people must feel that they are getting something from buying that brand that they cannot get elsewhere. In other words they have to perceive it as different in some way…Brands that command a higher price point in their category are typically seen as meaningful and different.” While the primary drivers of growth for advertising this year and beyond are smaller businesses app developers and others who will not have particularly strong brands in the conventional sense for larger traditional marketers to invest more heavily in their brands to justify the higher prices they plan to seek would be a source of upside growth for the media industry.

In addition to Kellogg’s we have compiled results from the largest publicly listed packaged goods segments at Nestle P&G Unilever Pepsico Coca-Cola L’Oreal Mondelez Kraft Heinz Danone Reckitt Colgate General Mills Kimberly-Clark J&J Henkel Hershey and Clorox. On a combined basis this group of global packaged goods companies grew 4.5% on an organic basis during the first quarter of 2021. This followed on what was a relatively strong 2020 all things considered of 3.6% organic growth. The growth rate was also notable as the sector faced relatively difficult comparables against the early phases of the pandemic last year which led to a similar 4.6% growth rate in 1Q20). North American growth was only slightly softer vs. other markets but then the year-ago period was slightly stronger in North America vs. the rest of the world last year. On a two-year basis growth rates were similar.

Looking at individual groups of business segments by their core products food businesses grew organically by 5.2% in 1Q21 ahead of the 4.0% growth rate posted in each of the full year 2020 and 1Q20. Beverages were still relatively soft and were close to flat similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter but well ahead of the year’s average. Out-of-home consumption serves as a significant drag for these companies. Petcare was up 8.9% sustaining the rapid growth we have seen for an extended period of time (above mid-single digits since the beginning of 2019). Personal care businesses were also relatively soft growing by 1.1% or below the pace of growth observed in the fourth quarter and full-year 2020 levels both because of pantry loading during the first quarter of 2020 but also because consumers are still not consuming all personal care products as they used to. Despite similar pantry loading trends for home care products growth is still elevated at high single-digit levels with a gain of 8.0% on our calculations.

Unsurprisingly e-commerce continues to grow rapidly: a subset of companies among this group that disclosed e-commerce growth or share of revenue attributable to e-commerce indicates that growth was around 48% in the first quarter only slightly slower than full-year 2020’s 55% pace of expansion. E-commerce now accounts for around 14% of total revenue up from 10% in the year-ago quarter and 8% in the calendar year 2019. Of course some segments remain relatively less dependent than others as food-centric marketers generally have been able to rely on retailers staying open over the course of the past years while others whose goods primarily sold through “non-essential” channels were more dependent on investing in direct-to-consumer or other e-commerce based sales channels.

The week was also punctuated by reporting from Roku which posted its results for the quarter as well. Roku’s results showed 35% more active accounts and 49% more time spent on the platform which in total resulted in 18.3 billion hours of streaming content (vs. 12.3 billion in the year-ago quarter). Per account we can calculate a 9% increase in streaming hours year-over-year.

For reference total TV consumption in the US amounted to 102 billion household viewing hours in the most recent quarter with 22.4 billion hours originating from internet-connected devices according to Nielsen. Year-over-year household growth in internet-connected device-based consumption amounted to 15% because of the very difficult comparable with last year’s first quarter.

We are mindful that Roku has a relatively small but growing international presence which will account for a share of the 18.3 billion hours. The company claims that now more than one in three smart TVs sold in Canada feature Roku and that it has the #2 operating system for Smart TVs sold in Mexico. =

Growth in Roku accounts coincides with (and probably partially contributes to) the decline in pay-TV subscriptions as well. On our calculations during the first quarter of 2021 traditional satellite and cable services and incremental vMVPD (virtual MVPDs or internet-based pay-TV distributors) households tracked by Nielsen declined by approximately 4% on a combined basis during this period. This compares with a decline that ran below 4% in each quarter of 2020. In total Nielsen estimates that there are now 87 million households or 72% of the country’s total with pay-TV services now. 12% of total households (a subset of the 72% figure) are solely served by vMVPDs well below the historic peaks exceeding 90% as recently as 2013. Similar trends are occurring in many other markets around the world albeit from lower levels of peak pay-TV penetration: this past week Liberty Global also reported results and while pay-TV is growing in some newer markets such as Poland it is declining in other more valuable ones such as the UK where Roku among others are investing for their future growth.

All of these overlapping trends contribute to the increased availability of addressable and connected TV inventory but also to the increased scarcity of traditional linear television inventory. Inflationary conditions for like-for-like units of inventory inevitably will follow. Fortunately for marketers and media owners television remains a medium that is a key contributor to brand-building efforts although its ongoing erosion means that marketers need to continually invest in finding ways to build their brands without relying as much on television in the future as they did in the past. Whatever vehicles marketers choose to use what matters is that they continue to invest in their brands so that they can be better positioned to earn the prices they plan to seek from consumers in the years ahead.

As a result one woman created “Mother’s Day Work Clubs” which offered hygienic education and support for moms.

Now many mothers who gave birth during the COVID-19 pandemic are looking for similar types of support.

“We know that before the pandemic about one in three moms struggled to get enough diapers to keep their babies clean and dry and comfortable” said Jennifer Randles “And since the pandemic we have every reason to believe that that number has increased.”

Randles is an associate professor and chair of sociology at California State University Fresno.

""Diaper prices have gone up just recently because the materials that they use to make diapers are getting more expensive” said Randles.

She studies families and children and how public policies and programs can help them and for the last four years she’s been focusing on diaper needs.

""Right now we know that a lot of moms are struggling to get their babies very basic needs whether that’s food or diapers or access to safe housing” said Randles “You know so it’s a particularly important issue now because we know that more people are struggling economically because of the pandemic.”

Some of these same issues led to the genesis of Mother's Day in America which began with Anna Jarvis and her mother Ann Jarvis in the 1850s.

""During that time infant and child mortality rates were really high” said Randles ”And unfortunately the elder Jarvis lost nine of her children largely because of epidemics that spread due to unsanitary conditions that were really common during this time.”

Inspired by the tragic death of nine of Ann's 14 children she began hosting work clubs focused on hygienic childcare.

“And so the elder Jarvis started these ‘Mother’s Day Work Clubs’ because she wanted to help moms and families learn about sanitary childcare practices and also to collect resources for moms in her community” said Randles.

In 1907 Ann’s daughter Anna decided to host a memorial service for her mother creating a day of recognition.

By 1914 President Woodrow Wilson had declared the second Sunday in May to be officially recognized as Mother's Day in the United States.

""Unfortunately it became commercialized very quickly and in the latter years of her life Jarvis was really trying to fight that” said Randles “To fight the commercialization of mother’s day and to really have it returned to its roots to the original intent of celebrating maternal sacrifice not profit.”

More than a century later Randles is reminding us what Mother's Day is all about.

""It’s about supporting mothers who maybe don’t have as much as other mothers and really coming together as a society and saying look we’re going to value mothering in general” said Randles “To make sure that we have a society where no mother has to worry about whether or not her baby has everything that they need to thrive.”

Randles says she's spoken to mothers who go without their own food medicine or other basic needs just to make sure they can afford food and diapers for their babies.

Luckily there are local places that offer support. For more information on where you can donate diapers or other basic need items locally

The is also a great resource for anyone who needs assistance.

Thanks to  diapers and other feminine products will remain tax-free in the state until December of 2021 which provides relief from the roughly 7.5% tax usually added to diaper costs.

4 The U.S. Government Has Turned Its Back On Public Toilets When it comes to the most desired spots to relieve yourself in public the global ranking is as follows: 1. Every public toilet in the civilized world 2. Particularly tall bramble bushes. 3. International airports. 4. Your own underpants. 5. The U.S. of A Sadly from black people to women with a slightly too-pronounced Adam’s apple America has a long tradition of barring its most vulnerable citizens access to public restrooms. But in 2020 we’ve finally reached true equality now that no one can go into a public restroom anymore. For decades local governments have been dutifully neglecting the state of their public restroom to the point of utter disrepair. Then instead of dealing with the issue they simply handed off the unenviable task of toilet toll keeping to bars libraries and that one McDonald’s that hasn’t changed the lock combo to the bathroom in ages. Jason Michael Flickr If you don’t want us to figure that it’s 6-9-6-9 McDonald’s then stop hiring teenagers. The pee-dancingly urgent flaws in this system became very obvious during the pandemic. With businesses and public buildings shuttered and outdoor restrooms looking more like crack dens than crack relievers Americans no longer have anywhere to go when they need to go on the go. This neglect is making society’s transients both the professional and amateur kind quite desperate. Homeless folks in cities are forced to wear diapers as they’re no longer afforded even the dignity of having a shit and a soap-dispenser shave in the only bathroom without a non-optional gloryhole. Delivery drivers have learned to no longer trust their bathroom finder apps and just carry around enough pee tubes and empty bottles that their cabs look like it’s Bring Your Beerbongs To Work Day. And so many women got tired of squatting in between cars that the sales of female pee funnels have skyrocketed. Sandwich Flickr Mostly because they don’t realize they pee so fiercely it’d give a penis recoil. Advertisement Not that the situation is any better for those upright male citizens who want to quickly drain their lizard behind a dumpster. While the government was stripping the public toilet system of its funding they were also stripping Americans of their constitutional right to pee freely. Pulling down your zipper within a 500-mile radius of a school and you risk not only being thrown into jail but being branded as a registered sex offender. (For the well-being of the children of course.) The same tiny-bladdered tots who if they forgot to go before leaving the house will have a furious cop fining them up to $2500 or arresting their guardian for “child neglect” before they can even unlatch the second button on their Winnie the Pooh overalls. And if you think this draconian lizard-draining dystopia doesn’t apply to you think again. Even during the lockdown only 13% of Americans managed to avoid having to hover over a public restroom toilet. Despite this and in part due to decades of neglect and decay Americans simply can’t be bothered to stand up for their right to relieve themselves outside of the home and continue to look down on public restrooms as dens of drugs dereliction and unbridled gay cruising. But it doesn’t have to be this way! With proper funding and innovation public restrooms can be number two utopias. Just look at France’s open-air pissoirs and self-cleaning sanisettes. Or Japan’s high-tech glass arthouses that show off their cleanliness while also blurring out people self-consciously doing their business. Just imagine a public toilet on every American corner an Apple Store-like transparent cube with a swaying CGI flag and the constant screams of a bald eagle giving you total privacy and peace of mind. That’s the kind of government relief all political factions could get behind. Advertisement That is if we could support such sewage works. Which we can’t because ... Advertisement

3 Wet Wipes Are Clogging Up Sewers And Cleaning Out Budgets Between wiping everything down like a panicked ax murderer and blowing out our buttholes eating homemade sourdough instead of Wonderbread America’s use of flushable wipes has gone through the roof. Or more accurately down the toilet where our obsession with keeping everything clean is quickly destroying the place we keep our filth. Thanks to the hygienic high stakes of the pandemic moist towelette manufacturers have seen financial increases of up to 30% in just a year. But simultaneously many state governments have had to increase their sanitary budgets as desperate sewage workers engage in a losing fight against fatbergs the undulating sewage clots made up of countless flushed wet wipes cooking fats and a terrifying amount of mouth masks. The problem has gotten way past dumping some low-level adventurers into the sewers to deal with these gelatinous cubes. Over the past year South Carolina alone has had to increase its anti-fatberg budget by $110000. The titanic problem now requires entire teams of engineers and sewage divers (and you thought your job involved a lot of wading through shit) to prevent its sewer systems from becoming more clogged up than Humpty Dumpty’s arteries. Matt Brown Flickr Because he’s an egg. Eggs are high in cholesterol-- y’know let’s just drop it. Advertisement “But” I can hear the delicately-bottomed implore “I specifically buy the wipes that say that they’re flushable.” But what do you think flushable means? A gallon of cooking oil is “flushable.” A baby alligator is “flushable.” The hard plastic packaging of the wipes that read “flushable” is “flushable.” Unbeknownst to most consumers the term is technically pointless as the moist towelette industry keeps its flushability standards so low they can wipe the bottom of the barrel with them. And even those few wipes that aren’t a scam no longer have time to properly biodegrade before becoming absorbed in the yawning maw of the nearest fatberg and aiding in the frequency of sewage shooting out of pipes like crap Krakatoas. Advertisement And this sphincter-tightening crisis may not be shrinking anytime soon. Sewage experts fear that when office workers starved of shame after a year of attending Zoom meetings in a shirt and three-day-old underwear return to the office they will no longer tolerate the lick of the cat’s tongue that is office-level toilet paper and might bring their precious wipes with them to work. In response to this ongoing plumbing pandemic state governments are starting to push not only for wipe-control bills but lawsuits against moist towelette companies for misleading and causing harm to the public. In response Big Wipe has formed the Responsible Flushing Alliance a lobby to clog up the system by diverting the blame to consumers and urging the government to remind citizens to limit toilet use to the “Three P’s”: Pee Poop and Projectile vomit. Advertisement Actually that last one should be toilet paper but you won’t be able to afford that soon anyway because ...

2 The More Toilet Paper We Buy The More Expensive It Will Become In the fourteenth century toilet paper was invented. This has been widely regarded as a bad move. Yet despite scholars of every century warning against its use preferring even to go back to the ancient ways of using sponges moss and seashells (that’s right) our lazy asses kept growing more and more dependent on dabbing our sphincters with wasteful napkins like a bunch of bourgeois butthole Burgundians. And if we weren’t paying a high price for our over-reliance on toilet paper before the pandemic we sure will be after. Advertisement Advertisement People who work from home may still be pooping on company time but their dimes now pay for their own toilet paper. This has made the commercial TP industry richer than its wildest dreams. In 2020 Kimberly-Clark the number two of number twos made an extra $750 million from people hoarding their toilet paper like a dragon with diarrhea. Yet despite this banner year both Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark have announced they will be dramatically raising the prices of toilet paper before the end of 2021 a price spike that will undoubtedly be shoved up the rosy cheeks of the consumer.

Wiping their hands clean of this decision Big Toilet Roll claims that it has no choice but to shaft the consumers as the pandemic has created a serious supply shortage. Between the wood pulp industry struggling to pinch off enough of the Amazon to meet the higher demand and supply lines being as stretched thin as the last piece of toilet paper on the roll (that the Ever Given spent weeks clogging up the Suez Canal didn’t help) product production costs are on the rise. “We expect a more challenging environment especially compared to last year” bemoaned Kimberly-Clark CEO Michael Hsu. This would cause an unacceptable return to normal after the lucrative poop profiteering of the pandemic.

The global economy is rapidly shifting fuel sources from carbon-emitting fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives like renewable energy. However it will take decades and trillions of dollars to make the switch. Because of that the economy will continue needing a variety of fuel sources to bridge the gap in the interim.

That's why investors shouldn't completely disregard more traditional energy options. With that in mind we asked some of our energy contributors what energy companies they believe could be long-term winners during the energy transition. They see the brightest futures for The Southern Company (SO 0.88%) Kinder Morgan (KMI 0.21%) and Enbridge (ENB 1.09%).

The other clean energy

Reuben Gregg Brewer (The Southern Company): The world looks at renewables like solar and wind as the de facto winner in the low carbon energy space. But the world has had clean alternatives for a long time including hydro power and nuclear power. Although generally safe a small number of high-profile accidents have left nuclear power on the outs. However it provides reliable base load power that can help support the growth of intermittent solar and wind. Many believe it will be a vital part of the clean energy future.

One supporter is U.S. utility giant The Southern Company which is building two nuclear power plants right now (the only nuclear plants being built in the country today). The Vogtle project as it is known has been a long slog including the bankruptcy of Westinghouse and the impact of the the coronavirus. That said once these two plants are finally up and running which should be sometime in the next two years The Southern Company will have reactors that it can rely on for decades to come as it phases out dirtier carbon-based options. And all the power that the Vogtle nuclear power plants generate will come with zero carbon emissions.

The Southern Company's dividend yield is a fairly generous 4% today (backed by two decades worth of annual dividend hikes) which is well more than twice what the S&P 500 index is offering up. It's also a step above the roughly 3.15% the average utility provides using the Vanguard Utilities Index ETF (VPU 0.89%) as a proxy. It's worth a look for dividend investors trying to find a clean energy play that's not wildly overpriced.

Vital infrastructure for the energy transition and beyond

Matt DiLallo (Kinder Morgan): While the world is rapidly pivoting toward renewable energy it will still need fossil fuels for quite a while. The cleanest option during this energy transition is natural gas. That's why the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects demand for gas to rise 29% by 2040.

This outlook bodes well for Kinder Morgan a leader in transporting natural gas in North America. Utilization of the company's existing gas network should remain high enabling it to continue generating steady cash flow. Further as demand rises it will provide Kinder Morgan with opportunities to expand its pipeline network in the future.

Meanwhile Kinder Morgan's existing assets could play a key role in transporting and storing the fuels of the future. For example the company can transport renewable natural gas and a 5% to 10% gas-hydrogen blend on its existing pipelines with little to no modifications. Moreover it could eventually repurpose much of its gas pipeline network to move hydrogen. That could yield major expansion opportunities since that fuel is one-third as energy dense as natural gas implying it would need three times the infrastructure capacity.

That's why the IEA believes that ""existing gas infrastructure is a valuable asset with significant storage capacity that can be repurposed over time to deliver large volumes of biomethane or with modifications low-carbon hydrogen."" Given this potential essential future role for Kinder Morgan's existing energy infrastructure network it could be a long-term winner as the economy transitions fuel sources.

Built to last

Neha Chamaria (Enbridge): The adoption of renewable energy may have picked up the pace but fossil fuels still accounted for 84% of the global energy consumption in 2019. In fact there are barely any alternatives yet for nearly 80% of oil's end-user demand such as in industrials air marine and heavy-duty vehicles. Clearly it'll take a really long time for clean energy sources to displace fossil fuels if at all and some energy companies could still thrive. Enbridge for example should continue to transport crude oil and natural gas through its extensive pipeline network for decades to come. As one of North America's largest energy infrastructure companies Enbridge has solid clout in the midstream oil and gas space.

In fact Enbridge has silently undergone a sea change in the past decade reducing dependency on liquid pipelines and expanding its natural gas transmission storage and distribution infrastructure. Although a fossil fuel natural gas is a relatively cleaner traditional source of energy.

Enbridge has its plans well in place. Through 2023 it aims to focus on its existing pipeline of projects which includes modernization of gas transmission. Beyond 2023 Enbridge foresees an organic growth development pipeline worth $30 billion of which more than $10 billion could be spent on gas transmission alone and nearly $6 billion on gas distribution and storage. Roughly $7 billion could go toward renewables and only the remaining to liquid pipelines. Enbridge believes its focus on natural gas and some spending on renewables should help the company achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

More importantly Enbridge is confident its growth-spending plan could boost its distributable cash flow per share by 5% to 7% in the long run which should also mean bigger dividends for shareholders from this energy company that could win even as the world shifts to renewable energy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9tZWdoYW4tbWFya2xlLW9mZmljaWFsbHktY2hpbGRyZW5zLWJvb2stMTAwMDAwOTkyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meghan Markle Is Officially a Children's Book Author,"The Duchess of Sussex is adding ""author"" to her post-royal résumé.

The Duchess of Sussex is adding ""author"" to her post-royal résumé!

Meghan is releasing her debut children's book titled The Bench on June 8. The story focuses on the special bond between a father and son viewed through a mother's eyes. It was inspired by Meghan's own family experience with her husband Prince Harry and son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor.

According to an official press release the book ""captures the evolving and expanding relationship between fathers and sons"" as well as ""reminds us of the many ways that love can take shape and be expressed in a modern family."" The Bench published by Random House Children's Books is illustrated by award-winning artist Christian Robinson. Meghan will also narrate the audiobook edition.

""The Bench started as a poem I wrote for my husband on Father’s Day the month after Archie was born"" said Meghan in a statement. ""That poem became this story. Christian layered in beautiful and ethereal watercolor illustrations that capture the warmth joy and comfort of the relationship between fathers and sons from all walks of life; this representation was particularly important to me and Christian and I worked closely to depict this special bond through an inclusive lens. My hope is that The Bench resonates with every family no matter the makeup as much as it does with mine.""

Mallory Loehr the EVP and publisher for Random House Books for Young Readers Group expressed her excitement for the Duchess of Sussex's literary debut.

""Meghan's touching text explores the relationship between fathers and sons and undeniably tugs at the heartstrings that parents and caregivers feel"" said Loehr in a statement. ""Christian's art beautifully matches the tender emotion of Meghan’s words and every spread is infused with a vibrant sense of joy and love. The Bench is timeless—it feels destined to become one of those books that people will be reading for generations to come.""

Global packaged goods companies sustained solid growth during the first quarter of 2021 rising 4.5% organically. Like other companies in other industries all of them are facing input cost inflation to a meaningful degree and are likely to raise prices for consumers. But as the CEO of Kellogg’s reminded everyone on their earnings call this week marketers can earn price increases by building stronger brands.

Television advertising has been one of the most important vehicles used to build brands; however change is occurring rapidly as illustrated by this week’s results from Roku and other data related to declining conventional pay-TV subscriptions. Whatever vehicles marketers choose to use what matters is that they continue to invest in their brands to better position themselves to earn the price increases they will increasingly need.

—–

Virtually all packaged goods companies have now reported their first quarter 2021 results and input cost inflation remains a key trend. Costs will inevitably be passed along to consumers as the year progresses. Addressing how to deal with this phenomenon on its earnings call this week Kellogg’s CEO said “we have to earn that price in the marketplace through investing in our brands (and) through innovating.” It may seem paradoxical to suggest incurring more cost in order to offset other costs and yet it certainly can work. In an article from Kantar published last year titled “Why pricing power is a brand’s greatest asset” they stated “to justify paying more for a brand people must feel that they are getting something from buying that brand that they cannot get elsewhere. In other words they have to perceive it as different in some way…Brands that command a higher price point in their category are typically seen as meaningful and different.” While the primary drivers of growth for advertising this year and beyond are smaller businesses app developers and others who will not have particularly strong brands in the conventional sense for larger traditional marketers to invest more heavily in their brands to justify the higher prices they plan to seek would be a source of upside growth for the media industry.

In addition to Kellogg’s we have compiled results from the largest publicly listed packaged goods segments at Nestle P&G Unilever Pepsico Coca-Cola L’Oreal Mondelez Kraft Heinz Danone Reckitt Colgate General Mills Kimberly-Clark J&J Henkel Hershey and Clorox. On a combined basis this group of global packaged goods companies grew 4.5% on an organic basis during the first quarter of 2021. This followed on what was a relatively strong 2020 all things considered of 3.6% organic growth. The growth rate was also notable as the sector faced relatively difficult comparables against the early phases of the pandemic last year which led to a similar 4.6% growth rate in 1Q20). North American growth was only slightly softer vs. other markets but then the year-ago period was slightly stronger in North America vs. the rest of the world last year. On a two-year basis growth rates were similar.

Looking at individual groups of business segments by their core products food businesses grew organically by 5.2% in 1Q21 ahead of the 4.0% growth rate posted in each of the full year 2020 and 1Q20. Beverages were still relatively soft and were close to flat similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter but well ahead of the year’s average. Out-of-home consumption serves as a significant drag for these companies. Petcare was up 8.9% sustaining the rapid growth we have seen for an extended period of time (above mid-single digits since the beginning of 2019). Personal care businesses were also relatively soft growing by 1.1% or below the pace of growth observed in the fourth quarter and full-year 2020 levels both because of pantry loading during the first quarter of 2020 but also because consumers are still not consuming all personal care products as they used to. Despite similar pantry loading trends for home care products growth is still elevated at high single-digit levels with a gain of 8.0% on our calculations.

Unsurprisingly e-commerce continues to grow rapidly: a subset of companies among this group that disclosed e-commerce growth or share of revenue attributable to e-commerce indicates that growth was around 48% in the first quarter only slightly slower than full-year 2020’s 55% pace of expansion. E-commerce now accounts for around 14% of total revenue up from 10% in the year-ago quarter and 8% in the calendar year 2019. Of course some segments remain relatively less dependent than others as food-centric marketers generally have been able to rely on retailers staying open over the course of the past years while others whose goods primarily sold through “non-essential” channels were more dependent on investing in direct-to-consumer or other e-commerce based sales channels.

The week was also punctuated by reporting from Roku which posted its results for the quarter as well. Roku’s results showed 35% more active accounts and 49% more time spent on the platform which in total resulted in 18.3 billion hours of streaming content (vs. 12.3 billion in the year-ago quarter). Per account we can calculate a 9% increase in streaming hours year-over-year.

For reference total TV consumption in the US amounted to 102 billion household viewing hours in the most recent quarter with 22.4 billion hours originating from internet-connected devices according to Nielsen. Year-over-year household growth in internet-connected device-based consumption amounted to 15% because of the very difficult comparable with last year’s first quarter.

We are mindful that Roku has a relatively small but growing international presence which will account for a share of the 18.3 billion hours. The company claims that now more than one in three smart TVs sold in Canada feature Roku and that it has the #2 operating system for Smart TVs sold in Mexico. =

Growth in Roku accounts coincides with (and probably partially contributes to) the decline in pay-TV subscriptions as well. On our calculations during the first quarter of 2021 traditional satellite and cable services and incremental vMVPD (virtual MVPDs or internet-based pay-TV distributors) households tracked by Nielsen declined by approximately 4% on a combined basis during this period. This compares with a decline that ran below 4% in each quarter of 2020. In total Nielsen estimates that there are now 87 million households or 72% of the country’s total with pay-TV services now. 12% of total households (a subset of the 72% figure) are solely served by vMVPDs well below the historic peaks exceeding 90% as recently as 2013. Similar trends are occurring in many other markets around the world albeit from lower levels of peak pay-TV penetration: this past week Liberty Global also reported results and while pay-TV is growing in some newer markets such as Poland it is declining in other more valuable ones such as the UK where Roku among others are investing for their future growth.

All of these overlapping trends contribute to the increased availability of addressable and connected TV inventory but also to the increased scarcity of traditional linear television inventory. Inflationary conditions for like-for-like units of inventory inevitably will follow. Fortunately for marketers and media owners television remains a medium that is a key contributor to brand-building efforts although its ongoing erosion means that marketers need to continually invest in finding ways to build their brands without relying as much on television in the future as they did in the past. Whatever vehicles marketers choose to use what matters is that they continue to invest in their brands so that they can be better positioned to earn the prices they plan to seek from consumers in the years ahead.

In a recent announcement fast-food giant Burger King U.S. is testing sustainable alternatives for its cutlery straws drink lids frypods Whopper wrappers and napkins and will be further expanding its Loop reusables testing program through its partnership with The Coca-Cola Company and Kraft Heinz.

Burger King U.S. has launched a green packaging pilot program to create scalable solutions for eight of its most used items like Frypods that are developed with renewable unbleached virgin paperboard; cutlery created with cPLA a plant-based plastic; and napkins made out of 100% recycled fiber that will be tested in 51 of its restaurants in Miami.

In addition the company will test paper and plant-based straws along with strawless lids in an effort to phase out up to 500 million single-use plastic straws every year from all its participating restaurants in the country. This would mean that 910 metric tons of GHGs per year would be eliminated which is the equivalent of 196 vehicles driven for a year.

For Burger King’s Whopper sandwich wraps the company will test two new options that translate into a 13% and 34% reduction in the paper compared to previous wraps that could help eliminate 500 to 1500 metric tons of paper waste annually across the country.

In a press release seen by Green Queen head of innovation and sustainability at Burger King Matthew Banton said: “Sustainable packaging is a cornerstone of our restaurant brands for good journey and this new pilot represents a huge opportunity for us to make a difference. We’re optimistic about our progress and are committed to reducing waste to do our part in creating a more sustainable future.”

Once these solutions are available for patrons to test Burger King will use the feedback from consumers and accordingly improve the products and its overall alternative packaging system to launch these solutions on a larger scale next year.



Following its partnership with circular packaging startup Loop in October of last year to pilot reusable packaging for items like the Whopper and drinks the fast food giant plans to expand its solutions from existing locations like New York City Portland and Tokyo to Paris and London. To help facilitate this the fast-food giant will be joining hands with the Coca-Cola Company and Kraft Heinz and will use all the firm’s resources insights and packaging expertise to maximize the national potential of these solutions in the future.

Vice president Global RBI Customer Team of The Coca-Cola Company Barry Danckert said that the team is always innovating and rethunking how consumers enjoy Coca-Cola beverages. “We are excited to partner with Burger King to offer a reusable packaging alternative for their guests. This effort supports The Coca-Cola Company’s World Without Waste initiative and virgin plastic reduction goal.”

“Burger King has been leading the charge in foodservice sustainability and Kraft Heinz is excited to partner with them and Loop to offer reusable packaging around the world. Global companies and global brands have the power to help shape the world for good and Kraft Heinz is committed to a better future with responsible recycling and reusable initiatives” concluded Peter Hall president U.S. Away From Home Kraft Heinz.

Several companies supermarkets and governments are innovating and thinking of sustainable alternatives and solutions to end single-use plastic packaging for instance recently as part of an environmental bill French grocery chains will be switching to food refill stations in an effort to completely end the use of disposable plastic packaging and even major brands like Unilever PepsiCo and Colgate-Palmolive will be discussing ways on implement circular solutions for olastic and packaging with biotechs such as LanzaTech and Modern Meadow in an upcoming two-day virtual Rethinking Materials conference that will be held between May 19-20.

Chicken lumber microchips gas steel metals chlorine and ketchup packets: What do they all have in common? They’re all (nearly) impossible to find.

Shortages are popping up across the supply chain as the pandemic messes with shipping demand supply and all the other levers of the global economy.

Here’s what’s hard to get why and for how long according to CNN Business’ writers.

Chicken

The fried chicken wars are putting a strain on the poultry population. Major chains including KFC Buffalo Wild Wings and Wingstop (WING) are “paying steep prices” for chicken and suppliers are having trouble keeping up demand because of difficulties attracting workers the Wall Street Journal reported this week.

That’s proving to be a problem for KFC: Its revamped chicken sandwich is selling twice as well as its predecessor and becoming too popular to meet demand. Interest in the product along with tight chicken supply has made keeping pace with customers’ orders the “main challenge” for KFC as it enters the second quarter according to Yum CEO David Gibbs.

Some restaurants removed chicken tenders and Nashville Hot flavored chicken items from menus at some restaurants because of limited supply WSJ reported.

Chlorine

A chlorine shortage is looming. Shutterstock

Summer is around the corner but anyone looking forward to a refreshing dip in the pool to cool off may be in for a big “shock.” A chlorine shortage may make it more difficult for pool owners to buy the sanitizing tabs.

Chlorine supplies are running low due to a fire at a chemical plant in Louisiana last August that was damaged by Hurricane Laura. As a result prices for tabs have skyrocketed. A quick look at Amazon shows that a 50-pound bucket of 3-inch chlorine tablets from the In the Swim brand now costs as much as $169.99 about double the normal cost.

“The extent of the chlorine shortage is still unknown” said B&B Pool and Spa Center a Chestnut Ridge New York-based retailer on its website.

What’s clear is that pool owners should consider stocking up sooner rather than later. “With regard to retail pricing it is a fact that we are seeing increases across the industry” said Michael Egeck CEO of pool supplies company Leslie’s during a February earnings conference call.

Computer chips

In the market for a new car smartphone or washing machine this year? A global shortage of computer chips could mean you have to wait a while — and pay more.

A growing number of manufacturers around the world are having trouble securing supplies of semiconductors delaying the production and delivery of goods and threatening to push up the prices paid by consumers.

Several factors are driving the crunch which was initially concentrated in the auto industry. The first is the pandemic which plunged the global economy into recession last year upending supply chains and changing consumer shopping patterns. Car makers cut back orders for chips while tech companies whose products were boosted by lockdown living snapped up as many as they could.

The shortage is going from bad to worse spreading from cars to consumer electronics. With the bulk of chip production concentrated in a handful of suppliers analysts warn that the crunch is likely to last through 2021.

Gas

Good luck finding gas this summer. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

Millions of people stuck at home for more than a year are expected to hit the road for much-needed post-pandemic vacations this summer. But good luck finding gas.

It’s not that there’s a looming shortage of crude oil or gasoline. Rather it’s the tanker truck drivers needed to deliver the gas to stations who are in short supply and that could lead to challenges at the pump come Memorial Day.

Between 20% to 25% of tank trucks in the fleet are parked heading into this summer due to a paucity of qualified drivers according to the National Tank Truck Carriers the industry’s trade group.

“We’ve been dealing with a driver shortage for a while but the pandemic took that issue and metastasized it” said Ryan Streblow the executive vice president of the NTTC. “It certainly has grown exponentially.”

Gas prices which typically rise at the start of the summer as seasonal regulations take effect — requiring the more expensive “summer blend” of gasoline needed to combat smog — are also rising.

The national average price of regular gas already stands at an average of $2.94 a gallon up more than 60% from a year ago when prices and demand were bottoming out. The national average could surpass $3 a gallon this summer and even get higher if any hurricanes hit the Gulf Coast or if there are any other disruptions to supply such as a refinery fire. The Friday ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline — one of the nation’s largest and most critical sources of fuel delivery -— is also sparking fears of a looming price spike.

Ketchup

Heinz is increasing ketchup packet production by 25%. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

Shortages of ketchup — specifically in packets that often come with your to-go order — started popping up around the country last summer and the plot has thickened.

How did this happen? It started with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention discouraging traditional dine-in service at restaurants and suggesting more pandemic-friendly options like delivery and takeout instead.

Suddenly restaurants coast to coast were packing up entrees side dishes and cold beverages for a steady string of people working from home swirling past in their cars. Those customers expected condiments. So those traditional restaurants jumped into direct competition with fast food places which had also shut down their dining rooms and upped their orders for ketchup packets.

Demand and prices went up and supply went down. Heinz the biggest ketchup producer in the country is at the epicenter of the problem and taking steps to address it. The company recently announced “a 25% increase in production totaling 12 billion ketchup packets…a year.”

Lumber

The lumber shortage is delaying construction of new homes. Josie Norris/Bloomberg/Getty Images

As the pandemic crushed the US economy last spring sawmills shut down lumber production to brace for a housing slump. The slump never arrived and now there isn’t enough lumber to feed the red-hot housing market.

The shortage is delaying construction of badly needed new homes complicating renovations of existing ones and causing sticker shock for buyers in what was already a scorching market.

Random-length lumber futures hit a record high of $1615 on Tuesday a staggering sevenfold gain from the low in early April 2020. That’s a big deal because lumber is the most substantial product that home builders buy.

The good news is that industry executives expect lumber production to catch up with demand — eventually. Samuel Burman an assistant commodities economist predicted in a recent note to clients that there will be a “sharp fall” in lumber prices over the next 18 months.

Metals

Rare earth elements is soaring in demand. Sebastian Meyer/Corbis News/Getty Images

As countries switch to green energy demand for copper lithium nickel cobalt and rare earth elements is soaring.

But they are all vulnerable to price volatility and shortages the International Energy Agency warned in a report published this week because their supply chains are opaque the quality of available deposits is declining and mining companies face stricter environmental and social standards.

Limited access to known mineral deposits is another risk factor. Three countries together control more than 75% of the global output of lithium cobalt and rare earth elements.

The Democratic Republic of Congo was responsible for 70% of cobalt production in 2019 and China produced 60% of rare earth elements while refining 50% to 70% of lithium and cobalt and nearly 90% of rare earth elements. Australia is the other power player.

In the past mining companies have responded to higher demand by increasing their investment in new projects. But it takes on average 16 years from the discovery of a deposit for a mine to start production according to the IEA. Current supply and investment plans are geared to “gradual insufficient action on climate change” it warned.

Steel

A steel shortage is also gripping the country. George Frey/Bloomberg/Getty Images

Steel is just the latest shortage to hit the US economy as it recovers from a pandemic that scrambled supply chains and set off sharp shifts in demand.

Much like lumber the steel industry was caught off guard by the rapid recovery in demand that began last summer — especially in the auto industry. “All of a sudden people were buying lots of cars” said Tanners the Bank of America analyst.

And it took time for America’s aging steel mills to resume the production they had sharply cut at the onset of the pandemic. Steel inventories shrank rapidly and shipments were delayed just as steel buyers began ordering more than usual.

The good news for steel buyers at least is that analysts say all of the US steel production capacity that was idled during the pandemic has returned.

Cincinnati City Council passed an ordinance in September 2020 limiting the use of single-use plastic bags at all brick and mortar food-service establishments. The ordinance was slated to begin January 1st of this year but was postponed due to the pandemic.

The average plastic bag is used for 12 minutes but can last for more than 500 years.

Kroger and Cincinnati are not alone businesses and communities across the globe are taking steps to reduce plastic pollution. You don’t have to try hard all you have to do is take a walk or drive in your community and you will see there is a plastic pollution problem or more accurately a plastic pollution crisis. The problem has existed from the inception of plastic. Plastic bags were intended to be disposable but engineered to last forever. On average plastic bags are used for 12 minutes but can last for more than 500 years. These bags tumble across our cities and farms clog our sewers and are ingested by wildlife both terrestrial and aquatic. Plastic does not biodegrade it is broken down into small pieces through sunlight and wave action. These small pieces referred to as microplastics have filled our fresh waterways lakes and oceans- resulting in a plastic soup. Rochester Institute of Technology estimates there is 381 metric tons of plastic in Lake Erie.

22 million pounds of plastic enter the Great Lakes every year.

The Ohio Sea Grant among others are concerned with the consequences of microplastics in the Great Lakes as this contamination extends to our drinking water and local sportfish. We unknowingly ingest plastic when we eat fish and seafood breathe plastics in through the air and consume plastics found in our drinking water and even our beer.

Ditch the plastic bottle of water: there is twice as much plastic in your bottle than your tap!

As we ingest microplastics we expose ourselves to toxic chemicals. Plastics are made of fossil fuels including oil and fracked gas. Additionally thousands of chemicals are added to plastic to make it soft hard or more flexible. There is a long list of toxic chemicals used to manufacture plastics some to avoid include: Bisphenol A (BPA) phthalates dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). While BPAs are eliminated from our body through sweat and urine the remaining chemicals persist and accumulate in our fat internal organs and can also be found in breast milk. These ‘forever chemicals’ (PFAS) are very concerning. Through emerging research we are learning more about the harmful dangers of these chemicals and wonder why government agencies are not protecting us from exposure?

Americans use 100 billion plastic bags each year which require 12 million barrels of oil to produce.

Eliminating plastic bags is one very easy way to reduce plastic production. Certain plastics are necessary for example when used to produce medical devices. But single-use plastic bags are not vital for society. When Kroger America’s largest supermarket chain who grossed $132.5 billion in 2020 announced the elimination of plastic bags it showed concrete actions they were taking to fulfill their mission Zero Hunger | Zero Waste to help create communities free of hunger and waste. But when this action only extends to the community within the city limits of Cincinnati it showed something very different. This is an action being legally forced through an ordinance passed by the City of Cincinnati. Kroger shouldn’t wait for a mandate to fulfill their Zero Hunger | Zero Waste mission. With 229 Kroger stores in Ohio there are a lot more communities that could benefit from the elimination of plastic bags.

Every year plastics add as much greenhouse gases to the atmosphere as 189 new coal plants. We know this number does not reflect the greenhouse gases solely emitted by Kroger. Kroger has the power to reduce 16% (total percentage of Ohio Kroger stores) of their demand for single-use plastic bags in the United States. That is huge! This would result in a significant reduction of waste and energy. But this will only happen if Kroger chooses to create policies that fulfill their mission of Zero Hunger | Zero Waste in Ohio not just Cincinnati.

If you want to fight the plastic pollution problem let Kroger know!

Tell Kroger you want plastic bags to be eliminated in your hometown: Explain how your community is facing the same struggles of litter contamination in your parks and playgrounds your community values environmental and human health and your community matters just as much as Cincinnati. These benefits should not only be extended to Cincinnati.

When the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020 the speed at which society changed was stunning.

In a matter of days a couple of weeks at most we went from being social creatures to hermits. Attending any event with crowds — at least outside of the daily toilet paper and bleach hunt at Kroger — felt like playing Russian Roulette.

The strangest part was how quickly it became normal. We masked up we isolated we distanced like we were told to do. It became part of the daily routine to the point that it’s now a social custom to wear a mask into any store. It feels awkward when we don’t even if we’ve had the vaccine and it doesn’t make a ton of logical sense.

Another odd thing was how quickly we adjusted to sports with no or limited crowds. Cardboard fans and piped-in noise replaced actual screaming fans. We used to look at an NFL or college football game with empty stands and think the team was doing poorly. By the end of the 2020 season it was the normal scene whether a team was 2-14 or rolling toward the Super Bowl.

Things have quietly taken another strange turn over the past month or so at least here in Mississippi. Fans suddenly reappeared.

Gov. Tate Reeves eased capacity restrictions on sporting events at the beginning of April and fans immediately flocked back to stadiums. Ole Miss had more than 10000 people for each game in a weekend series against Arkansas. The next weekend in Starkville Mississippi State and Ole Miss drew nearly 40000 fans for their three-game SEC series.

Locally it didn’t dawn on me until I looked in the stands during the National Anthem before the Vicksburg-Warren Central baseball game a couple of weeks ago. It was not quite a capacity crowd but the seats behind home plate were pretty full and fans lined the fence between the dugouts and down the third base line.

A few days later when St. Aloysius hosted Brookhaven Academy for a baseball playoff game at Bazinsky Field the bleachers behind home plate were full and dozens of fans surrounded the perimeter.

The Vicksburg vs. New Hope softball game that was replayed sold 250 advance tickets — and could have sold many more if they’d been available — in 24 hours.

At last weekend’s MAIS track meet at Jackson Prep not only was the parking lot full but cars were parked a half-mile up and down Lakeland Drive. I’ve been covering that event for years and can’t remember it ever being that crowded. Hearing the dull buzz in between events and the occasional roar during an exciting race was music to the ears.

It struck me at that point how far we’ve looped around in the past year. We went from roaring crowds to no games at all to games without fans to games with some fans and now back to having regular crowds again. It is as strange to see crowds now as it was not to see them last summer.

The years of 2020 and 2021 will long be remembered as the COVID years. A long strange dream in which society was turned on its head as we wrestled with fear uncertainty science and recovery. Thankfully it looks like we’re finally waking up from it.

The company building the MSG Sphere at The Venetian on Friday said the cost of the 17000-seat performance venue is likely to climb by 10 percent to $1.826 billion.

The possibility of a higher price tag was no surprise and company officials had noted the possibility in recent calls.

Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. said in a quarterly earnings release that capacity restrictions have continued to ease for the company’s entertainment venues in New York.

Following the company’s third quarter which ended March 31 New York authorities allowed Madison Square Garden home of the New York Knicks National Basketball Association team and the National Hockey League New York Rangers to operate at 10 percent capacity — The Garden’s first events with guests since March 2020. Following the end of the quarter New York state officials announced that indoor venues with capacities of over 1500 including The Garden and the company’s other New York performance venues will be permitted to operate at up to 30 percent capacity beginning May 19.

Restaurant capacities also are affecting MSG properties.

The company said that while indoor dining restrictions also eased during the quarter many of Tao Group Hospitality’s venues continued to operate with significant capacity restrictions and others remained closed throughout the quarter. Since the close of the fiscal 2021 third quarter Las Vegas restaurant capacity increased to 80 percent on May 1 and it was announced that New York City restaurant capacity was scheduled to increase to 75 percent beginning on Friday before going to 100 percent on May 19 subject to certain social distancing requirements.

For the fiscal 2021 third quarter the company reported revenue of $43.1 million a decrease of $138.8 million as compared with the same period last year. In addition the company reported an operating loss of $108.6 million and an adjusted operating loss of $69.4 million for the fiscal 2021 third quarter as compared with an operating loss of $155.6 million and an adjusted operating loss of $18.1 million in the year prior.

“It’s clear that people are eager for opportunities to gather together and as capacity limits for our venues continue to increase our company with its unique collection of live entertainment assets will be well-positioned to meet this pent-up demand” said James Dolan executive chairman and CEO of MSG Entertainment.

“Looking ahead we also believe the MSG Networks transaction would further strengthen our portfolio and help set the stage for long-term value creation for all shareholders” he said.

The company said it continues to make significant progress on the construction of MSG Sphere. Last February the company announced that the venue’s cost estimate inclusive of core technology and soft costs was around $1.66 billion.

Numerous factors — including the ongoing effects of the global pandemic and its impact on the global supply chain — have affected and will continue to affect that estimate. Associated costs of materials and labor as well as changes to project design scope and schedule have also added to the cost the company said.

As a result the company estimates the cost of the venue has increased by about 10 percent. Relative to the cost estimate the company’s actual construction costs for MSG Sphere through March 31 were about $712 million not counting $65 million paid by Las Vegas Sands Corp. in the 2020 fiscal year and include $62 million of expenses that were unpaid as of March 31.

The company remains committed to bringing MSG Sphere to Las Vegas which it expects to open in 2023.

The Dallas Morning News

Hopes that lawmakers would give voters the choice to legalize gambling in Texas just aren’t in the cards this year.

Despite gambling interests throwing millions of dollars and dozens of lobbyists at the effort lawmakers who authored bills to bring casinos and sports betting to Texas said they won’t become law this year. Dallas was and remains a top target for a casino destination resort.

“There’s not time for it to pass this session” GOP Rep. John Kuempel told The Dallas Morning News this week.

With less than a month left in the legislative session none of the bills to expand gaming in Texas made it over their first hurdle. Because the Texas Constitution bans most gambling the legislation would have needed a two-thirds vote of lawmakers and then the support of a majority of voters to become law.

There wasn’t the political appetite to pass the bills this session Kuempel said especially after lawmakers learned that budget holes they hoped to fill with gambling revenues would be shallower than previously expected. But despite the outcome he and Sen. Carol Alvarado a Democrat who partnered with him on the effort said they believe momentum is on their side.

“I’m more optimistic than I’ve ever been” Alvarado who has filed some version of this legislation for more than a decade told the Dallas Morning News. “We’ve known all this is a long-term attempt.”

Alvarado and Kuempel’s bills would have let voters decide whether to amend the state Constitution to legalize gambling. The eventual aim was to allow sports betting as well as eventually bring casino resorts to several major cities. The bills would have also allowed the state’s three federally-recognized Indian tribes to expand into full-fledged gambling including slot machines on their land a right the state has long denied them.

Several major sports franchises also threw their support behind an effort to legalize just sports betting.

That bill which also needed approval of two-thirds of lawmakers would have allowed the state to sell permits known as “skins” to online sports betting platforms like DraftKings or FanDuel to partner with pro sports franchises or horse racetracks. Some skins would allow only for mobile betting while others would have permitted on-site wagering at stadiums and tracks.

Ten percent of winnings would have been funneled into state coffers to spend on public schools.

The Sports Betting Alliance which counts several Dallas pro teams including the Cowboys Mavericks and Texas Rangers among its members issued a statement noting that their bill had stalled out but they were still hopeful to get a committee vote on a resolution to regulate unofficial or offshore sports betting apps that don’t provide consumer protections.

The largest investment in expanding gaming came from the Las Vegas Sands Corp. the gambling empire created by the late Sheldon Adelson. In addition to a major ad campaign which will continue throughout the session the Sands spent at least $3 million on 74 lobbyists to make their case. They too struck a positive tone in a statement to the Dallas Morning News on Friday.

“We have said from the beginning that we’re committed to Texas for the long haul” said Andy Abboud senior vice president of government affairs for the Las Vegas Sands. “We have made great strides this session and have enjoyed meeting with lawmakers about our vision for destination resorts and answering all the questions they have.”

Abboud added they would work through the rest of the session and afterward to “ultimately turn this vision into a reality.”

Kuempel put it more simply. If he is re-elected he will try again when lawmakers next meet in 2023 saying: “Let’s roll the dice.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vYXRobGV0ZWNobmV3cy5jb20vb3VyYS1yaW5nLTEwMC1taWxsaW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oura Ring: Investors Bet Another $100M,"The NBA WNBA and NASCAR all had their athletes use Oura the health tracking ring to detect fevers and prevent outbreaks bolstering its profile.

At the start of 2020 the Oura Ring was one in a vast market of health trackers distinguished by its tiny size — it’s worn as easily and inauspiciously as a wedding band — and its popularity among trendsetters like Jack Dorsy and Prince Harry. Then the company behind the device Finland’s Oura Health quickly pivoted to marketing the device to flag fever symptoms that could be a sign of COVID-19 infection. Soon the NBA was tasking its players to wear Oura Rings.

With that boost to the company’s profile Oura Health which was founded in 2013 and whose sole product is the ring raised $100 million in series C funding. The company has raised $148.3 million to date and its total valuation is thought to be about $800 million.

Among the investors in this round of fundraising were the investment arm of the LA Dodgers and a mix of funds associated with sports (The Chernin Group and Elysian Park) and health (Temasek JAZZ Venture Partners and Eisai Co. Ltd). The company said the investment dollars will go to research and development new hires marketing and customer experience development.

Although the ring’s main marketed functions had been tracking sleep activity and a slew of physiological signs added together into the category of “readiness” Oura Health jumped on the opportunity to show that its rings could be useful in the fight against COVID-19 almost as soon as the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic.

Last spring it launched a program to detect COVID-19 symptoms in the U.S. military and the company partnered with West Virginia University and the University of California San Francisco for studies on its products’ effectiveness to predict an outbreak among healthcare professionals. The results of the WVU study are not in. The UCSF emphasized more research is needed but stated: “Our analyses support the hypothesis that wearable sensors can detect illnesses in the absence of symptom recognition.”

As anxious sports leagues eyed “reopening” strategies Oura Ring became a tool. The WNBA UFC Aston Martin Red Bull Racing NASCAR and the Las Vegas Sands casino group joined the NBA in utilizing it. So far 500000 rings total have been sold.

The basic ring is $299 although options and add-ons can increase the price to $999. (You can get an Aura with an actual diamond to seamlessly imitate or double as a wedding ring.)

Mitigation strategies among small elite groups like sports teams and the public at large have come and gone with the ever-changing pandemic situations but some investors evidently see the use for the Oura Ring in a future pandemic and for the endgame of COVID-19. Or possibly they were just impressed by how quickly the company was able to pivot with a relatively small and simple piece of technology.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA1LzA5L3doeS1vbmxpbmUtZ2FtYmxpbmctc3RvY2tzLWFyZS1mYWxsaW5nLW9mZi1hLWNsaWZmL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Online Gambling Stocks Are Falling Off a Cliff,"This industry has gone out of favor quickly.

In the second half of 2020 online gambling stocks were some of the hottest growth stocks on the market. DraftKings (DKNG -1.13%) started a trend when it went public via SPAC merger but Penn National (PENN -1.57%) Rush Street Interactive (RSI -0.48%) Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG) and Gan Ltd (GAN 2.50%) all joined the party by hitting public markets or making deals to expand in online gambling.

The euphoria that drove those gains is quickly being unwound in 2021 partly due to the sell-off in growth stocks and partly because expectations may have gotten too high for online gambling. Here's how you should be looking at the market and the leading stocks in the space.

Casinos are open again

One of the reasons online gambling stocks did so well in 2020 was because physical casinos were closed. People who wanted to gamble needed to do so online and revenue jumped as a result.

We haven't seen a decline in online gambling revenue yet but we are starting to see very bullish signs from physical casino operators. Caesars Entertainment (CZR -0.36%) said this week that weekends are essentially sold out and they are expecting a big rebound in revenue in the second half of the year.

If there are limited discretionary entertainment and gambling dollars to be spent a rise in spending at the casino could translate to less spending online. That's at least one reason online casino stocks have been down recently.

Online gambling is far from profitable

Investors are also starting to see that online gambling companies are far from profitable and likely won't make money for years. It's very expensive to reach new customers resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on sales and marketing and it's far from clear when these companies will report net income.

Let's take DraftKings as a proxy for the industry because it's the biggest publicly traded pure-play company in the U.S. You can see below that revenue is growing quickly but sales general and administrative expenses exceed revenue and losses are accelerating.

This could reverse course as the company gets larger and customer acquisition costs fall but that could be years from now. And with sky-high valuations investors have soured on the long runway these companies may have to profitability.

Waiting in the wings

What I'll be watching in 2021 is how established casino operators react to the online gambling market. Companies like Caesars MGM Resorts (MGM -1.48%) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN -1.52%) have their own online gambling operations and established brands. They will be able to use cash flow from their existing businesses to fund online gambling growth and if they take market share from digital players who are burning cash it could be bad for stocks like DraftKings Rush Street Interactive and Golden Nugget Online.

If stocks continue to fall we could even see these companies poach online gambling stocks to bolt onto their own operations. Las Vegas Sands (LVS 0.11%) has indicated its interest in buying online gambling assets in some form and that could be a possibility if stock prices fall.

Until online gambling companies prove they're sustainable long term I'm going to have a hard time betting on the industry. For now my money is on MGM Resorts translating its industry-leading brands and growing online gambling business into a juggernaut in the industry. And it can wait years for the online gambling market to mature something online-only companies may not have the financial flexibility to do."

KUWAIT CITY May 8: During the challenging times that the world has been experiencing following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in late December 2019 the Refrigeration and Oxygen Company Ltd (AIRTEC Group) has been very instrumental in helping India to cope with the pandemic when the country faced shortage in various items especially oxygen.

The AIRTEC Group stepped in to ship to India 100 MT medical grade LOX through Kuwait government. AIRTEC also filled 1600 cylinders with medical oxygen. The AIRTEC Group said “It is our endeavor to stand by India in times of need.”

The complete shipment has been done in coordination with the Indian Embassy in Kuwait and the government of Kuwait to help India fight the pandemic

The chairman of the company Mr. Alhareth AbdulRazzaq Alkhaled said all the liquid oxygen and the oxygen gas filled in the cylinders has been supplied free of charge by the company.

He thanked his company employees for a job well done. He also thanked the government of Kuwait and the Indian Embassy in Kuwait for providing all the necessary support.

The Ambassador of India to Kuwait HE Sibi George visited the plant location and met with the company chairman it’s COO Mr. Peeyush Jain and it’s Technical director Mr. Ahmed Elalfi. He thanked the AIRTEC Group for all the efforts and the extraordinary support that the company has provided during this crisis in India.

The company also thanks AlRashed International Shipping Co. for their 24/7 logistical support and services provided.

The AIRTEC Group works together to bring to you total gas solutions year-on-year growth from its inception in 1960 as Refrigeration and Oxygen Co. Ltd; Kuwait until date has been leaders in the field of gas and gas-related products and services. The company started with a dream grew with belief and stood to fulfill its promises.

The company has since then expanded it’s operations in the United Arab Emirates with Emirates Industrial Gases Co. LLC. established in 1978 in UAE; in Qatar with Qatar Oxygen Company established in 2005 and in Bahrain in 2011 when the AIRTEC Group acquired a 100% stake in Bahrain Medical & Industrial Gas Plants established in 1965. The company further established its presence in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2015 as Watan Industrial Gas company.

The Group companies are now the largest manufacturers and suppliers of medical industrial specialty gases and mixture gases in the Middle East.

And to help the company provide its customers with services that go beyond global standards in safety reliability and customer satisfaction the ROC Group has entered into a joint venture in 2009 with Praxair Inc. based in the United States — one of the largest industrial gases companies worldwide. PRAXAIR merged with Linde group and is called now Linde Plc. the largest industrial gas manufacturer in the world.

To streamline the company’s business and provide an enhanced range of products and services the group of companies has been rebranded as AIRTEC.

Starting July 1 current Vice President of Education and Visitor Experience Sheri Bernstein will assume the role of Museum Director succeeding Robert Kirschner who has served in the position since 2008. Additionally the Center has named Reuben J. Sanchez as Chief Financial Officer and Pamela Kohanchi as Senior Vice President General Counsel and Secretary.

Bernstein takes the helm of the museum as the Skirball prepares to dust off its exhibits and open up its doors to visitors. Kornberg emphasized Bernstein’s role in its popular Noah’s Ark exhibit as a reason for her appointment. “The success of Noah’s Ark and her contributions to exhibition development are a reflection of Sheri’s unwavering commitment to storytelling and accessibility her eye for inspired gallery design and her passion for engaging visitors as active participants to create impact” she said.

“The Skirball has such a special mission using the arts to help bring people together and inspire wonder foster exchange and promote justice” Bernstein said in a statement. “Together with our talented museum team I welcome the opportunity to work with artists and community collaborators to create exhibitions that extend beyond the galleries into our outdoor spaces and into the broader Los Angeles community.”

Sanchez comes to the Skirball from Live Nation where he served as regional Vice President at the North America Concerts Division overseeing nearly half a billion dollars in annual revenue. He will manage the investment strategy for the Center which has a $25 million operating budget.

Kohanchi joins the Center from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) where she served as Deputy General Counsel. In her position at LACMA she advised on projects and initiatives such as a planned $650 million building major art acquisitions and the awe-inspiring art piece “Levitated Mass.”

Bernstein will hit the ground running taking the position only weeks after the Skirball presents “Ai Weiwei: Trace” an exhibit by the groundbreaking and iconoclastic Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. The installation highlights individuals who have been persecuted by governments across the globe for their beliefs actions or associations–much like the artist himself. The exhibit opens on May 15.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tdXNpYy8xNDMzNTAyL0VsdmlzLVByZXNsZXktZmFtaWx5LUxpc2EtTWFyaWUtYm95ZnJpZW5kLUdyYWNlbGFuZNIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tdXNpYy8xNDMzNTAyL0VsdmlzLVByZXNsZXktZmFtaWx5LUxpc2EtTWFyaWUtYm95ZnJpZW5kLUdyYWNlbGFuZC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elvis: How The King would have handled teenage Lisa Marie’s boyfriends according to family,"Elvis Presley: Priscilla and Lisa Marie discuss singer in 2012

Elvis Presley’s only child Lisa Marie was just nine-years-old when her father died on August 16 1977. Sadly The King didn’t live to see his daughter grow up but now their family have shared how they think Elvis would have handled a teenage Lisa Marie bringing boyfriends home to Graceland. A fan sent in the question to Elvis’ cousins who run the Memphis Mafia Kid YouTube channel for their expert advice.

Danny Smith who knew Elvis Presley and Lisa Marie Presley as a child responded to the question having consulted his Memphis Mafia parents Billy and Jo Smith. The question was: “Had Elvis have lived longer how would you imagine he’d handle a teenage Lisa bringing boyfriends home.” Elvis’ cousin replied: “Elvis was open-minded…he would probably have that father talk.” Danny reckons The King would have said to a boyfriend of Lisa Marie: “Son I could be your best friend or I could be your worst damn enemy. You choose.” READ MORE: Elvis Presley’s Graceland bedroom: The King ‘liked it dark and cold’

Lisa Marie continued: “That’s when I got to be with him. He’d set up a little chair in my room and a TV.” Asked if Elvis was a strict father she replied: “He was not strict at all!” The 53-year-old said how her mother Priscilla Presley was the total opposite and really strict with her. Nevertheless when staying at Graceland with her father Lisa Marie would get up to all kinds of mischief. DON'T MISS

Lisa Marie would take full advantage of how her father was a night owl who would be asleep when she was up. She remembered: “He would sleep all day so me and my friends pretty much had the run of Graceland. “And I knew that nobody was going to tell me what to do because they would get fired. I was truly a terror to be honest.” When asked what traits of her father’s she has Elvis’ daughter replied: “His personality and intensity levels I can emulate pretty well.”

Back in 1975 Queen had the opportunity to once again perform at the Hammersmith Odeon (now known as the Apollo). Freddie Mercury Brian May Roger Taylor and John Deacon had previously given a concert there two years before as a support act to Mott The Hoople. But now headliners themselves Queen had four shows there in late November and early December as part of a tour before returning on Christmas Eve for their first live broadcast.

Bohemian Rhapsody was in its record ninth week run at the top of the UK singles chart and Queen were now set to perform a concert to millions live on BBC TV and radio. In this week’s episode of Queen the Greatest which features rare audio and footage from the sound test Brian said: “The big difference on that tour from previous ones was that we had this…the beginnings of some TV reinforcement…because TV makes all the difference. “It’s TV which makes you stopped in the street. It makes people feel like they know you.” While Roger admitted: “We felt unfashionable. We had the strength and mind to realise that unfashionable wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. “Because you could see people liking our music. I mean a lot of people.” READ MORE: Freddie Mercury’s Queen top The Beatles in poll of best driving music

Right at the end of the concert Brian May said to the audience: “You know we’ve taken our show around the world but we’ve never got to so many people all at once and this felt really good. “Thanks a lot for giving us a good year we’d like to leave you in the Lap of The Gods.” Interestingly the original multi-track tapes of the show were believed to be lost. However they were recovered in 2009 and restored by Queen sound engineers Justin Shirley-Smith Kris Fredriksson and Joshua Macrae. The re-mastered and restored concert was later given a special screening on October 8 2015 at Olympic Studios in London where some of Queen’s album A Night at the Opera had been recorded.

This Sunday marks Mother’s Day in Italy the US and other countries around the world. And in tribute to his mother Edi Andrea Bocelli has shared a beautiful lyrics video for his cover of the track Mamma. The popular 1940 song featured on Bocelli’s 2008 album Incanto and has been performed live by the Italian tenor on a number of occasions.

Andrea Bocelli was born in 1958 after his mother Edi rejected advice from doctors to abort Andrea because of concern he would be born with a disability. From birth the future star had problems with his sight and was later diagnosed with congenital glaucoma before becoming completely blind aged 12 after an accident at a football match. His mother’s decision to not terminate her pregnancy with him has inspired Bocelli’s own pro-life views. Captioned underneath the lyrics video the singer wrote: “The first word we learn how to say the first sound to mean something as if we see in her the heart and the secret of life itself from the start of our earthly adventure: mom!” READ MORE: Andrea Bocelli: Competition to meet the Italian tenor and more

Companies including Toyota JetBlue and Cigna are still donating thousands of dollars to the lawmakers who voted against Joe Biden's certification as president.

After a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6 to try and prevent Congress from certifying Biden's win many top US companies scrambled to cut ties with the 147 GOP lawmakers who voted against the results.

Dozen of companies including Walmart Amazon Morgan Stanley and AT&T said they would stop giving donations to these specific lawmakers and Hallmark even asked Hawley and Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall to return its donations.

Other companies including Microsoft Deloitte and Goldman Sachs said they would instead pause all political donations to both Republicans and Democrats. Many gave a set timescale for their pause.

A further group of companies said they would review their contribution policies or would take the January 6 events into account when awarding funding.

Jeffrey Sonnenfeld founder of Yale's Chief Executive Leadership Institute told Axios in March the companies that halted political donations are unlikely to lift this ban any time soon. However recent Federal Election Commission filings show that some companies are still giving to these lawmakers.

Color of Change which says it is America's largest racial justice organization and has more than 7 million members is urging these companies to halt the donations.

Jade Ogunnaike senior campaign director at Color of Change told Insider that Trump's presidency ""undermined faith in our democracy.""

She said lawmakers including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley who voted against Biden's certification ""would have been very happy to do anything possible that they could to ensure that Trump remained in the office.""

""You can't forget that these are not congresspeople that we can trust"" Ogunnaike added.

""It's incredibly important that corporations understand that and refuse to back people who were supporting violence in the transfer of power"" she said.

The vast majority of corporations who pledged to stop funding these GOP lawmakers have stayed true to their word — but some companies who made vaguer promises about assessing PAC criteria have restarted donations while others gave money instead to various Republican committees that in turn fund these lawmakers.

A busy plate of United Launch Alliance (ULA) missions for the remainder of 2021 continues to take shape following Friday’s completion of stacking operations of a Mighty Atlas V booster at Space Launch Complex (SLC)-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station Fla. The final topping-off of the rocket involved installation of the Extra-Extended Payload Fairing (XEPF) with launch targeted for 1:35 p.m. EDT on Monday 17 May. The mission will deliver the fifth geostationary element of the U.S. Space Force’s Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS GEO-5) to orbit and marks the eighth flight of an Atlas V in its “421” configuration equipped with a 13-foot-wide (4-meter) fairing two strap-on solid-fueled boosters and a single-engine Centaur upper stage.

The XEPF is a two-piece (or “bisector”) shell-like fairing which affords vibrational acoustic and aerodynamic protection for SBIRS GEO-5 during the launch and ascent phase; it will be jettisoned in the rarefied high atmosphere to expose this critical early-warning satellite to the space environment. Standing 45 feet (13.7 meters) tall the XEPF comprises an aluminum skin/stringer construction with vertical split-line longerons. After integration of the XEPF the Atlas V—which is set to embark on its 87th mission—rises a towering 194 feet (59.1 meters) above the Mobile Launch Platform (MLP).

As previously reported by AmericaSpace the flight hardware for the Atlas V arrived safely in Port Canaveral on 1 April. The 107-foot-long (32.6-meter) Common Core Booster (CCB) for the rocket together with its 41-foot-long (12.6-meter) Centaur upper stage departed ULA’s manufacturing site in Decatur Ala. on 23 March and traveled via the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico aboard the R/S RocketShip transport vessel. Shortly after its arrival on the Space Coast the Centaur was transferred to ULA’s facilities for flight preparations whilst the Atlas V CCB headed via flatbed truck to the ordnance bay in the Atlas Spaceflight Operations Center (ASOC).

Here it was put through initial preparations and declared ready to commence stacking operations for launch. Vertical integration of the two-stage rocket with its two Aerojet Rocketdyne-provided AJ-60A solid-fueled boosters began on 21 April in the cavernous interior of the VIF when the Atlas V was hoisted upright on the MLP. This completed the Launch Vehicle On Stand (LVOS) milestone and officially marked the start of the SBIRS GEO-5 launch campaign.

Late last month the two AJ-60A boosters—each standing 55.7 feet (17 meters) tall—were installed on opposite sides of the Atlas V CCB. With a combined propulsive yield of just under 760000 pounds (340000 kg) they will afford the stack more than half of its energy at liftoff. This will mark the 40th use of AJ-60-class boosters on Atlas V missions since July 2003. The most recent flight of an Atlas V with the boosters occurred during last summer’s launch of the Perseverance mission to Mars.

ULA intends to gradually retire its existing stock of AJ-60As over the coming months in favor of Northrop Grumman’s GEM-63 booster which first flew during last November’s NROL-101 mission. “They are being cut into our launches using a pre-defined schedule” ULA’s Heather McFarland told AmericaSpace of the upgraded boosters “with the complete transition to GEM-63s in the near future.”

With two solids a 13-foot-diameter (4-meter) fairing and a single-engine Centaur the Atlas V for SBIRS GEO-5 is designated “421” and will mark the eighth use of this particular configuration of the rocket since October 2007. It most recently saw service for the October 2017 launch of NROL-52 for the National Reconnaissance Office. In addition to a pair of missions for the NRO other past customers have included two Wideband Global Satcoms (WGS) for the U.S. Space Force two commercial communications satellites and NASA’s 2015-launched Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS). All told the 421 configuration can lift up to 30800 pounds (14000 kg) to low-Earth orbit or up to 15200 pounds (6890 kg) to Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO).

Uniquely May’s launch will be the first time an Atlas V has flown in the 421 configuration to lift a SBIRS GEO satellite to orbit. The first three SBIRS GEO missions in May 2011 March 2013 and January 2017 rode “401” boosters with no strap-on rockets although January 2018’s launch occurred on a “411” with a single side booster. ULA CEO Tory Bruno noted at the time of the SBIRS GEO-4 launch that the additional impetus afforded by the single solid provided “enough energy to allow Centaur to be immediately deorbited” after its mission rather than placing it into a designated disposal (or “junkyard”) orbit for slower decay and eventual re-entry. It is believed that the additional performance afforded by the 421 will permit a more optimized orbit for the payload.

SBIRS GEO-5 completed an ahead-of-schedule construction and testing campaign last October with the elimination of unnecessary programmatic oversight and reporting a restructured test program and a streamlined production schedule having enabled Lockheed Martin Corp. to finish SBIRS GEO-5 in only five years. Described as a “global guardian” for ballistic missile detection and defense it is the fifth geostationary element of an upgraded set of space-based infrared “eyes” and follows four previous missions also launched atop Atlas Vs between May 2011 and January 2018.

SBIRS forms part of a multi-billion-dollar Pentagon effort to replace the earlier Defense Support Program (DSP) network of early-warning satellites whose own ancestry extends back to the 1970s. It is expected to enable the United States’ space surveillance needs for the next two decades with focuses including advanced early warning missile defense and battlespace characterization. In its final form it will comprise six GEO satellites at geostationary altitude together with adjunct sensors aboard the HEO-1 and HEO-2 satellites which were inserted into highly-elliptical orbits back in June 2006 and March 2008.

The successful launch of SBIRS GEO-1 in May 2011 marked the culmination of a long and tortured development process which saw costs balloon by over 400 percent from an estimated $4 billion to over $17 billion. According to General Accounting Office (GAO) auditors as reported by Defense Industry Daily in February 2013 the program suffered from “immature technologies unclear requirements unstable funding underestimated software complexity [and] poor oversight”.

As circumstances transpired the Air Force’s apparent lack of alternatives for an urgent national requirement to have an advanced infrared surveillance system in orbit to actively monitor ballistic missile launches and nuclear events seems to have prevented SBIRS’ cancelation. Its capabilities include highly sophisticated scanning/staring sensors with improved infrared sensitivity and the scope to provide wide-area (“scanning”) surveillance and small-area (“staring”) observations. Three further SBIRS GEO satellites were launched in March 2013 January 2017 and January 2018.

In the meantime a $284.4 million contract for the purchase of long-lead items for GEO-5 and GEO-6 were awarded in March 2013 ahead of the definitive $1.86 billion deal between the Air Force and Lockheed Martin in June 2014 to fabricate both satellites. At the time of the award it was noted that the contract formed part of “a thoughtful acquisition strategy aimed at further reducing cost and cycle time”. In particular more than a billion dollars’ worth of saving were achieved through “block-buy” contracting practices and the elimination of unnecessary program oversight and reporting a restructured test program and a streamlined production schedule.

In September 2017 both the GEO-5 and GEO-6 satellites wrapped up their Critical Design Review (CDR) at Lockheed Martin’s Sunnyvale Calif. facility with Col. Dennis Bythewood director of SMC’s Remote Sensor Systems Directorate praising the “resiliency” of the program. Upon the completion of the CDR both satellites moved directly into manufacturing and integration. In February 2019 ULA was awarded a $441.6 million contract to launch three payloads—including SBIRS GEO-5 and GEO-6—with an expectation that the GEO-5 element would fly atop an Atlas V from Space Launch Complex (SLC)-41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Fla. as early as March 2021.

GEO-5 pressed smoothly through Thermal Vacuum (TVAC) testing last summer which constituted a “major milestone” in readying the satellite for final assembly. “Lockheed Martin Space overcame COVID-19-related challenges” noted the Air Force “to maintain assembly and test operations with minimal impacts.” Following its completion last fall SBIRS GEO-5 was delivered aboard a C-5M Super Galaxy transport aircraft from Moffett Airfield in California to the Space Coast in March.

The design of SBIRS GEO-5 marks the inaugural use of Lockheed Martin’s heavily modernized LM2100 “Combat Bus” carrying twin solar arrays and a powerful communications and imaging payload. In what has been described as a “technical refresh update” their newer components and more modern electronics are expected to achieve a boost in capability and reliability.

The new SBIRS benefits from 26 enhancements ranging from improved cyber-hardening greater spacecraft power propulsion and electronics common components to streamline manufacturing and a flexible design architecture. According to Lockheed Martin the LM2100 Combat Bus architecture will also form the baseline for the upcoming Next-Generation Overhead Passive Infrared (Next-Gen OPIR) Block 0 satellites and the Global Positioning System (GPS) Block III Follow-On series both of which are expected to enter service around the middle of this decade.

Led by the Infrared Space Systems Directorate at the Air Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) at Los Angeles Air Force Base in Los Angeles Calif. the SBIRS GEO satellites and their ground systems are operated by the 460th Space Wing at Buckley Air Force Base in Aurora Colo. “SBIRS’ role as an ever-present on-orbit guardian against global ballistic missile threats has never been more critical” said Tom McCormick Lockheed Martin’s vice president for OPIR Systems. “In 2019 alone SBIRS detected nearly one thousand missile launches which is about a two-fold increase in two years.”

In addition to SBIRS GEO-5 the Atlas V will also be transporting a pair of “Multi-Manifest Satellite Vehicles” on behalf of the Multi-Manifest Office of the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) headquartered at Los Angeles Air Force Base in Los Angeles Calif. in partnership with the U.S. Air Force Academy. Designated “TDO-3” and “TDO-4” the two 12U CubeSats—each measuring approximately 7.8 x 7.8 x 13.4 inches (20 x 20 x 34 cm)—are set to be deployed shortly before SBIRS GEO-5 itself.

Little has been revealed about their precise objectives with ULA noting only that “a multi-manifest mission set allows more capability to be placed on-orbit” with the eventual goal of “providing more critical capabilities to the warfighter”. Two earlier missions with similar designators TDO-1 and TDO-2 rode aboard Atlas Vs in August 2019 and March 2020 alongside the second-to-last and last Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) military communications satellites. In the case of TDO-2 the small satellite was released from its perch at the aft-facing end of the Centaur upper stage about a half-hour after liftoff. The two missions focused upon a range of orbital debris tracking and space domain awareness functionality tasks.

Coming only three weeks since the spectacular 26 April launch of a giant Delta IV Heavy booster from Vandenberg Air Force Base Calif.—laden with the classified NROL-82 payload for the National Reconnaissance Office—an otherwise flightless spring for ULA seems to be giving way to a busy second half of the year. Following SBIRS GEO-5 a long-delayed mission in support of Space Test Program (STP) objectives is presently targeted for June with the second uncrewed Orbital Flight Test (OFT-2) of Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner to the International Space Station (ISS) now formally scheduled for 30 July.

Heading into the late summer and fall a pair of classified U.S. Space Force missions—USSF-8 in August on an Atlas V in its never-before-flown “511” configuration and USSF-12 before year’s end—will be joined in December by the latest Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite (GOES-T) for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and in October by NASA’s ambitious decade-long Lucy mission to explore a half-dozen Trojan-class asteroids. All of these flights will originate from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station with the launch of Landsat-9 targeted for September from Vandenberg.

It remains to be seen if the Crew Flight Test (CFT) of the CST-100 Starliner will fly this year. In recent months there has been much speculation that Commander Barry “Butch” Wilmore Pilot Nicole Mann and Joint Operations Commander (JOC) Mike Fincke are not likely to fly their CFT mission until about six months after OFT-2 which would place their launch sometime in the spring 2022 timeframe. In any case as ULA’s manifest for the second half of 2021 gathers pace it looks increasingly probable that the recent Delta IV Heavy launch will be followed by as many as eight Atlas Vs and perhaps the maiden voyage of the Vulcan-Centaur heavylifter before New Year’s Eve.

FedRAMP completed 64 authorizations in fiscal year 2020 which is over 40% more than in the previous year. Additionally with the push to the cloud to accommodate a remote workforce agencies increased their use of FedRAMP-authorized cloud products by 55% within this same time.

The team also prioritized efforts to listen to customers and incorporate feedback into the program. A few examples include launching the FedRAMP agency liaison program and FedRAMP YouTube channel re-imagining the FedRAMP website and re-launching and revised FedRAMP procedural and technical guidance in support of cloud service provider and agency feedback.

Why Watch

GSA has two critical funding components from the American Rescue Plan — $1 billion for the Technology Modernization Fund and $150 million for the Federal Citizens Services Fund Mahan said. The funds are expected to drive innovation through interagency projects that enhance the government’s digital operations.

Mahan said she is excited to be in her new role.

“I am supporting an incredible team to design and deliver a digital government with and for the public” she said. “This work is focused on bringing trusted modern government experiences to the citizen and includes impactful programs and projects within cloud identity data and analytics public experience artificial intelligence and innovation.”

Here's What You Need to Remember: Despite the fact that it entered service in 2005 it has steadily been updated. The Raptor was engineered with a unique weapons ability a dynamic which has in recent years been massively upgraded.

Video footage of the F-22 in action aren't hard to come by on social media platforms but this 2:36 video—titled “INSANE F-22 Raptor Hype Video”— is unique in that it was produced by the actual F-22 Raptor Demonstration Team which is stationed at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Hampton Virginia and regularly engages in flights that showcase the unique capabilities of the aircraft. It offered Hollywood-worthy production values that highlighted the aircraft's ability to perform a variety of maneuvers; but also included rare slow-motion footage of the Lockheed Martin-built fifth-generation fighter.

The 360-degree video footage was reportedly the first to be filmed from a helicopter and it showcased the F-22 Raptor's supermaneuverability as it flew over Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in March of this year as part of a JBER Salutes.

The Hype Video has also been about the best chance and perhaps only way to see the F-22 in action this year due to the coronavirus outbreak.

As TheAviationist reported “Although most of the airshows this year were cancelled because of the COVID-19 outbreak the pandemic has not completely prevented the F-22 Raptor Demo team to perform some displays at the few airshows which have been held in a ‘drive in’ format with cars filled with people in attendance like the New York International ‘Drive In’ Air Show at the end of August or the 2020 Wings Over Houston Air Show and Bell Fort Worth Alliance Air Show last month.”

High Fliers

The F-22 Raptor Demonstration Team flies the advanced stealth aircraft at air shows around the globe and its demonstrations include the crowd-pleasing power loop split and tailslide as well as high-speed passes and dedication passes—maneuvers that are based on those designed for combat operations but are performed at much lower altitudes that most pilots are certified to fly.

The aerobatic display team has flown the F-22 since 2007 when the Air Force approved the aircraft for demonstration and this replaced the Air Combat Command's F-15C demonstration team. The team participated in its debut air show at Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB) in March 2007 and since that time has performed in more than 250 demonstrations across the world.

The U.S. Air Force F-22 is widely regarded as the most dominant fighter in the world. The F-22 Raptor is especially respected for its dogfighting ability and air-to-air maneuverability attributes which many contend separately it into a superior category compared with any other potential rival.

Despite the fact that it entered service in 2005 it has steadily been updated. The Raptor was engineered with a unique weapons ability a dynamic which has in recent years been massively upgraded. The Air Force Raytheon and Lockheed have integrated performance-enhancing software upgrades into the F-22s weapons to include the construction of newer AIM-120D and AIM-9X air-to-air weapon variants.

It also makes for one fun aircraft to watch in videos—thanks to the hotshots like the pilots in the F-22 Raptor Demonstration Team.

They had seen each other around Arkansas State University at Jonesboro for months before they met in the art department both there to work on projects for classes they didn't have together.

""Our styles were completely different"" says Josh who was a sophomore in 2000. ""She had on these big baggy clothes and I was sort of preppy at the time. We were definitely opposites.""

Lauren was studying studio art and she often spent hours in the studio creating and building sculptures.

""He just was not my type at all. I didn't usually date boys as cute as he was and he dated cheerleaders-- I was not that kind of girl"" she says of Josh. ""But we became friends. It was the best friendship.""

Josh was in the graphics art department.

""He has a beautiful aesthetic. It's one of the things I've always admired about him"" she says. ""His photographs are beautiful and his work was top notch.""

They gravitated toward each other because of their religious faith and because they didn't enjoy the same activities as most of their classmates.

""We were friends with everybody but we didn't like to party"" Lauren says. ""So a lot of times on the weekends we would just kind of hang out and watch movies or study and work or cook dinner or whatever. Sometimes we would go to church together. We were just sort of funneled together because of what we chose to do.""

For three years they were best friends. Lauren had another year of college after Josh graduated and moved to Little Rock so he could start work for Lockheed Martin at Little Rock Air Force Base.

""I was used to spending all this time with him and when he was gone I really missed him"" she says. ""We would sometimes meet in Memphis and just go do things like we did when we were in college together. We were still just friends.""

That summer Josh visited Lauren at her family's home in Lepanto.

""We went out to look at the stars because they are really beautiful out there"" she says. ""I asked him if he had ever seen a shooting star before and he said he hadn't.""

They found a dark spot in an open area and watched the sky.

""I just knew in my heart where a shooting star would be so I pointed up and I said 'Look right there'"" she says. ""At that exact moment this blazing shooting star shot across the sky and it was one of those crazy sappy moments like in a rom-com. It was unbelievable. Before that I had never thought about him in a romantic way and when that shooting star shot across the sky we both looked at each other differently.""

A few days later Josh sketched a shooting star for Lauren and wrote her a letter.

They dated long distance for almost a year as Lauren traveled to Italy to study fashion design.

By December 2005 after they had dated for about six months Lauren thought she saw signs that Josh was going to end their relationship.

""He started to be really weird really stressed out"" she says. ""I am the stereotypical messy artist. While we were dating I had crazy stuff in my car and in my dorm room which was an insane mess"" she says. ""I mean I totally had my act together but I just could function that way and he didn't. He started being critical about all of that. I was really sad.""

Instead of breaking up Josh proposed. They went out for a nice dinner and saw ""Cinderella"" at Arkansas Repertory Theatre and afterward they stopped by Josh's loft apartment downtown.

""I opened the door and there were Christmas lights hanging everywhere and there were candles and music"" Lauren says. ""He kind of just danced and twirled me around and sat me down and then he got down on one knee and proposed.""

His criticism she surmises stemmed from the fact that subconsciously he was considering they would soon be blending their styles in one household.

Lauren said yes and told Josh she needed at least six months to plan the wedding.

""I was studying fashion design and my first big goal was to make a couture-level wedding dress"" she says.

Josh was patient as Lauren designed and sewed understanding that they couldn't spend as much time together as she worked because he couldn't see the dress before the wedding.

""I was always at home working on my own"" she says.

They were married in a small ceremony on June 10 2006 at Trapnall Hall in Little Rock.

Josh and Lauren have two children -- Luca 9 and Magdalena 7.

All the stars -- shooting and otherwise -- have aligned for them allowing their artistic and organizational skills to indeed blend since they fell in love.

""I think we've sort of met in the middle over the years"" Josh says. ""We've become more similar.""

On 7 May 2021 the Luftwaffe (GAF German Air Force) showed photos of the construction of the first C-130J Super Hercules at Lockheed Martin's facility at Marietta-Dobbins ARB (GA). The Super Hercules construction number 382-5930 is the first of six aircraft three C-130J-30s and three KC-130Js that will be delivered between the end of this year and 2023.

The GAF Hercules will be delivered to Base Aérienne 105 (BA105) Evreux/Fauville (France Normandy) to join the new Franco-German Lockheed C-130J Super Hercules squadron.

On 21 September 2020 Scramble Magazine reported on the new combined squadron when the German minister of defence Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer and the French minister of defence Florence Parly symbolically laid the foundation stone for the new unit.

The yet unnamed squadron will operate ten C-130J transport aircraft four French and six German by 2023. It will be operated by 260 airmen 130 French and 130 Germans. The four French aircraft two C-130J-30s and two KC-130Js have already been delivered to Escadre de Transport 2/61 Franche-Comté (ET02.061) at BA123 in Orléans/Bricy before moving to Evreux/Fauville in the summer of 2021.

A bride-to-be was standing in front of a full-length mirror with her family and friends around her. They broke into applause. The bride was handed a framed poster. It read ""I said yes to the dress at Low's Bridal!"" People snapped photos of the beaming bride.

Prince who owns the business with her husband Stanley also smiled brightly.

""People ask me how I got into the bridal business and I say it was God's decision"" says Prince who at one time planned to follow in her father's footsteps and become a pharmacist.

Low's is located in the circa 1913 Rusher Hotel that has been fully restored on West Cedar Street in Brinkley. It houses more than 2500 gowns -- or almost enough dresses for every person in town. The hotel is at the crossroads of seven railroads that used to stop at the once-vibrant Monroe County town. At one time Brinkley had 10 hotels downtown and the Rusher was the largest.

But like many small towns its downtown now stands largely vacant. But then there is Low's. The restored three-story hotel is impossible to miss. The stately red brick building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Stepping into the entrance is like a dream come true for any girl who wished for a fairy-tale wedding. There's even a pale blue dress named the Cinderella for sale -- if the glass slipper fits.

SIX DRESSES AND A DRUG STORE

Prince is the daughter of Margo and Bob Low who was a pharmacist. They owned Low's Drug Store which is a bit of a misnomer -- in addition to typical pharmacy items the store offered fine china crystal silver jewelry cosmetics and children's clothing. Brides would register there for china silver and crystal. The Low family lived in a large apartment over the drugstore.

Margo was at a wholesale trade market in 1977 in Dallas shopping for children's clothes when a woman asked if she would be interested in selling wedding gowns. She said she didn't think Brinkley was big enough for a bridal store. But she bought six gowns anyway and set up a bridal shop on top of the drugstore. She sold all six dresses.

""The first one she sold off the floor coming out of the box. A girl walked in and said 'I hear you are going to sell wedding dresses.' And Mom said 'Yes. I just got them in.' And Mom opened a box and pulled one out and the girl said she would try it on. And that was her dress.""

The bridal shop eventually took over the drugstore and a nearby building. The business now offers one of the largest wedding gown selections in the country. A typical bridal shop offers 125 to 150 dresses Prince says. The Encyclopedia of Arkansas says the shop is ""one of the largest bridal shops in the United States attracting far-flung clientele to Brinkley.""

In 1981 the Princes bought the Rusher Hotel and turned it into the Great Southern Hotel a bed and breakfast and restaurant. A tornado in 1994 ripped the roof off and flooded the building.

After extensive renovations the Princes moved Low's Bridal to the hotel in 1997 where it takes up most of the first two floors. The Brinkley Fire Department is made up of volunteers and does not have enough personnel water pressure or equipment to fight a third-floor fire. So the third floor is used for storage.

With 2500 dresses fire protection is a must. Most dresses start at $1000 and go up to $4500. And the vast majority are wedding gowns. The store stopped selling prom flower girl or mother of the bride dresses years ago.

""Moms are hard. Moms tend to take care of everybody else before they get to find their dress. Then they are in a panic and they don't have time to order"" Prince says. ""It was really hard to take care of the bride and take care of the mom. And so to be better at what we do we take care of the bride.""

WEDDING DRESS HEAVEN

When the store was closed last year during the covid-19 pandemic Dorcas and husband Stan rearranged the gowns. Downstairs dresses are grouped in sizes 0 through 10. Upstairs dresses are in sizes 12 through 34.

""We try to do a good selection for every size because girls get disappointed"" Dorcas Prince says of the wide variety of sizes. ""If you can't try it on how do you figure out what style you like?""

Prince says she tries to have a good selection of dresses because a woman who wears a size 34 can't try on a size 16 and know what she will look like in it.

Despite the pandemic Low's recorded one of its best years of sales in 2020. She attributes it to brides-to-be who didn't want to wait until the crisis was over to get married and wanted to buy a dress quickly. Before covid-19 the shop would take 65 appointments on Saturdays from brides. During covid the shop took 45 appointments. Appointments are required even before the pandemic.

""You make an appointment because we work one-on-one. Every bride gets their own consultant"" she says.

Styles of wedding dresses are ever-changing. Strapless gowns used to be hot. Now many women want sleeves. Some dresses are even featuring a somewhat modified puffy sleeve reminiscent of the 1980s.

""There are a lot of things that have made full circle as far as fashion. ... We have seen puff sleeves. The vast majority don't want puff but the designers are showing it"" she says. ""Sometimes the designers are doing things that stretch the edge of the envelope to do something different. And there is not that much different to do. Somewhere in the past it has been done before.""

In addition to the Cinderella there is the Pocahontas -- a beaded number with skinny straps plunging neckline and train; and the Stevie Nicks -- a Bohemian look inspired by the singer.

""We have a certain percentage of girls -- it's not huge -- but we do well with black dresses. Last year and this year Halloween falls on a weekend and we've had a lot of girls go to New Orleans to get married or something like that. It's been kind of interesting.""

What is Prince's favorite style?

""That changes every week. When we go preview dresses it changes every six months. There are beautiful dresses of all styles. There are some of the cleanest simple dresses that if the right person owns it it is just magnificent"" she says. ""And then there is the prettiest sparkly big ballgown for the girl that's wearing it and loves it and it is just perfect.""

Angela VanZandt Bumpass decided to buy her gown at Low's for her July 2019 wedding to Rodger Bumpass. Rodger was in the same class at Little Rock Central High School with Stan Prince and the couples are friends.

As a bride in her mid 60s Angela wanted a dress that was age appropriate. She also wanted one that looked like something actress Audrey Hepburn would have worn.

""Dorcas is the iconic proper lady who knows all the rules that a lot of women have forgotten so I felt safe going there that I would be getting the right look for my age"" Angela Bumpass says. ""Going to Low's was like going back in time a better time a more genteel time.""

Bumpass who is a native Arkansan living in Burbank Calif. said she felt welcome the moment she walked through the door.

""It's the same feeling one gets when you walk into Tiffany's in New York. ... To me it was like stepping into wedding dress heaven"" says Bumpass who is a screenwriter.

WORKING FROM HOME

Prince and her husband live in an apartment on the second floor of Low's Bridal. With the exception of college Prince has always lived where she worked.

""No matter how bad the weather is my husband and I just walk out of the door of the apartment and we are at work"" she says.

Her first job was when she was 8 years old and made bows in the wrapping room at Low's Drug Store. At the store she also worked on displays was a salesperson and worked in the office. After graduating from high school she went to the University of Arkansas at Little Rock to study pharmacy -- just like her father.

At UALR she met Stan who was studying finance.

""My husband was in the Marine Corps and when we met in college he asked what do you do for fun in Brinkley and I said 'Well my best friend and I used to go shoot snakes on rice canals.' He said 'I don't think I've ever heard a girl say that before.'""

The Lows have two daughters. Prince's sister Rebecca was a fashion model in Italy Japan and New York. Rebecca now lives in Dallas and is an interior decorator.

""Dad didn't have any sons so I grew up going to deer camp fishing I did everything dad did"" Prince says.

Dorcas and Stan married in 1980. For her own wedding she chose a long sleeve A-line dress with minimal pearl beading and a splash of crystals. The wedding was at a Baptist Church and the reception was across the street at her mother's house.

GETTING OUT OF TOWN

The Princes also own a home on Lake Hamilton in Hot Springs. On Saturday nights they usually head to the resort town where there are a large selection of restaurants and entertainment. Low's is closed on Sundays and Mondays.

At one point they thought about moving their business to Memphis and even hired an architect to look at a couple of buildings they were interested in buying.

""In the end we figured out if we move to Memphis we lose the Little Rock business. If we move to Little Rock we lose the Memphis business"" she says.

There aren't a lot of dining options in Brinkley and when she is asked she recommends visitors try the Cottagemall and Cafe just down the street.

Beth Taylor owner of the cafe worked at the Great Southern Hotel from 1984-85 when it housed the restaurant and bed and breakfast. It was there that Taylor learned how to run a restaurant.

""Brinkley would be lost without Low's Bridal. It is by far the biggest drawing card we have. When I started my little cafe 16 years ago Yelp Tripadvisor and Google Maps were not in existence or if they were they were highly underutilized. Dorcas and Stan were some of my first regular diners locals who came to eat on a daily basis"" Taylor says.

""They were honest with me about what was important and gave me their input on my dishes when I asked. But more than that they recommended my cafe to their brides. As you know brides come from all over to 'say yes to the dress' and are always astounded that such a treasure as Low's is in our little Delta town. Without their referrals I doubt very much that I would be in business today. They also do business with us by allowing us to cater their employee meals each week as well as their Christmas event. Low's Bridal is our unsung hero here in Brinkley.

""Personally I admire Dorcas for so many things. She is such a lady. Strong hardworking and very stylish. She is my mentor in so many ways"" Taylor says.

Brinkley Arkansas -- bridal gown destination of the South. It always astonishes Prince.

She has friends in New York who own a large bridal store and called her to ask what she was doing to get her shop ready to open during the covid-19 pandemic.

""We talked about all of the different things we were putting in and what they thought about doing. We talked for over an hour and a half. It was a very interesting conversation.

(WECT) - UNCW graduate Phil McGee who is currently 67 years old is not one to leave anything unfinished no matter how long it takes but dropping out of UNCW in 1977 was not a hard decision.

“My mind wasn’t on school you know my grades weren’t very well” McGee said. “I even got a letter from the Dean asking me to stay home a semester to figure out if college was right for me.”

At the time McGee decided to pursue a career with Lowe’s Companies but the decision to drop out of college would follow him for the rest of his life.

“I thought about it all my life and it was in the back of my mind as something that I just did not finish” he said.

In 2015 McGee had a heart attack that gave him the final push to go back to school.

“They were getting ready to take me in to do the stents — I was laying there — the only thing that kept coming up was of course my family I love them and I wanted to spend more time with them but I kept thinking about not finishing things” McGee said. “College was it. I didn’t finish it and it was on my mind and I wanted to go back and finish.”

So in 2017 40 years after dropping out of UNCW McGee returned to the registrar’s office to enroll in classes again. They looked at his grades from the 70′s and told him he was basically going to have to start over. McGee had no problem with that.

But what McGee did have a problem with was his fellow classmates not seeing him as their peer. He didn’t fit in the way he wanted to.

“They thought I was a professor and I didn’t want to be a professor I wanted to be one of them” he said.

So he did something no professor would ever do: he decided to rush Pi Kappa Alpha the same fraternity his son Hunter had been a part of when he attended UNCW.

“One Sunday afternoon I went around and found the fraternity house knocked on the front door and they were scattering they didn’t know who this old guy was” McGee said.

The fraternity unanimously decided to let him because of his legacy status but McGee made them a promise.

“I said I’ll come in as a legacy but when I leave this campus I’ll leave a legend and I’ve lived up to that” McGee said.

His fellow brothers can back him up on that claim.

“It has always just been an inspiration to just see him succeed and just do what he does where he works many many hours during the week at his job while also being able to balance school and then also being able to devote time to our fraternity and still be able to attend all our events” said graduate Landon Calton a Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity brother. “Anyone on this campus and anyone in the UNCW community they know Magoo and they know him by name and he’s become a legend.”

“Magoo” is the nickname that McGee has earned during his time at the university.

“Honestly I don’t think I would have had the full college experience without him” said graduate Ryan Ewald a Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity brother. “He’s really taught us a lot of different things that is almost — legend almost doesn’t even do the whole thing doesn’t even do it justice but we all know he’s a legend.”

A legend because McGee truly juggled it all: fraternity parties and functions school work and traveling 900 to 1200 miles a week for his own business.

“I would spend many a time in truck stops with my computer up on my dash board my notebook and me taking notes McDonald’s because they had internet if my internet wasn’t working and I’d do my classes” McGee said.

That hard work paid off. McGee graduated Saturday from UNCW with a 3.8 GPA and Cum Laude honors. He earned a degree in business.

“To get that program the other day and see the honor of Cum Laude under my name we just both teared up it was just you know the hard work paid off” he said.

McGee says some of his most meaningful times at UNCW were the deep heartfelt conversations he had with his fraternity brothers.

He also had a great support system along the way: his wife Charlie.

“She would always give me the ride to the parties but would not stay up late enough I had to Uber home” he said. “She was a great support group for me. There have been times when I wanted to quit. When the stress of school and homework and exams and all that got so much I wanted to quit and she was the one who told me don’t you do it.”

His message for everyone: it’s never too late to finish.

“If you cut the grass and you just cut the front yard you’re not finished. You got to cut both the front and the back to be finished” McGee said. “If you start school and you don’t finish finish it.”

The two men crafted their raft from 20 Home Depot buckets a piece of plywood some duct tape and two plastic kiddie pools. They then decided to launch out into the sea off Del Playa Drive and Camino Del Sur in the middle of the night.

Santa Barbara County Fire said the water was calm that night but temperatures were still in the mid-50s and the men were not wearing wet suits.

As they attempted to maneuver their boat the two found themselves pushed further and further from shore up to about 300 yards before a passerby saw the struggle and contacted County Fire for help around 2 a.m.

The fire department responded with two water rescue units three engines one truck and one battalion chief. An AMR ambulance was also dispatched to the area.

The water rescue teams sent out three rescue boarders while two personal watercraft were launched from Campus Point at UCSB.

The rescue boarders reportedly reached the men after about 30 minutes and brought them safely to shore.

The men were assessed by medics and determined to be uninjured.

Crews said alcohol was not a factor in this event."

Embattled companies announced sweeping cuts to their workforce bracing for loss. The country’s unemployment rate soared driven by an exodus of jobs that made the 2008 recession look tame.

While low-income workers were laid off at triple the rate they were during the Great Recession many of Canada’s largest companies announced pay cuts for their executive teams — a show of solidarity in a bleak time for many Canadian households.

High profile CEOs opted to forego some or all of their salaries and some redirected them to charity.

Telus’ top executive Darren Entwistle donated a quarter of his salary to “the Canadian health care workers on the front lines battling COVID-19.” Lululemon Athletica’s CEO Calvin McDonald volunteered a 20 per cent pay cut along with others on the board. At Cenovus Energy where the company announced more than 1000 layoffs after merging with Husky Energy executives pledged to take salary reductions between 12 and 25 per cent.

But how much did these top earners really give up?

To find out the Star examined recently-published financial reports from several of Canada’s largest companies all of which pledged to reduce executive pay during the pandemic.

The story among each of them was the same: executives were showered in riches regardless of company performance. In most cases the losses sustained through salary reductions were more than made up for with other compensation — cash bonuses stock options and more.

Some CEOs made millions more in 2020 than the year before despite pledging a pay reduction during the pandemic.

Top executives at SNC-Lavalin Gildan Activewear Inc. Cenovus Energy and Telus were rewarded with compensation that eclipsed their 2019 earnings and erased salary drawbacks.

“It’s clearer than ever now that the salary cuts were no more than a public relations move” said Unifor president Jerry Dias who represents unionized workers at several of Canada’s biggest companies. “It’s just about displaying to people that they’re good corporate citizens while taking huge bonuses at the expense of the workers.”

For Gildan Activewear the troubles began in March 2020. With concerts cancelled and travel restricted the Montreal-based clothing manufacturer had few outlets to sell their staple product — blank shirts bought by wholesalers and used most often for band merchandise and vacation swag.

Scrambling to cut costs the company ordered pay reductions for senior staff and a shortened four-day work week. In an April 2020 press release it announced a 50 per cent salary cut for its top executives in the second quarter of the fiscal year.

But despite the cuts Gildan’s top executives emerged from 2020 with higher earnings than before.

Glenn Chamandy CEO and co-founder of the company more than doubled his pay from 2019 corporate records show. He received bonuses amounting to nearly $13.5-million and a total compensation of $16.5-million making him one of the country’s highest-paid bosses.

Gildan’s CFO Rhodri Harries received a $5.7-million raise. And Benito Massi president of manufacturing earned a $3.4-million raise amounting to a total of $5.4-million.

Chamandy’s bonuses were granted “in recognition of his role in leading the Company through the COVID-19 crisis” said a company spokesperson in a statement to the Star. But the company reported a terrible year overall losing $225.3-million by year end.

The story is similar for SNC-Lavalin led by recently-appointed CEO Ian Edwards. In March 2020 the company asked employees to take a three-month pay cut as business slowed. “These actions will make a vital difference in dealing with the short-term impacts on our business” Edwards told employees in a memo. “I hope by doing this quickly and volunteering together we are able to preserve a stronger future together.”

All senior management including Edwards volunteered to take a 20 per cent salary cut. But by the year’s end Edwards’ compensation had grown to $8.02-million up almost $1 million from the $7.1-million that his predecessor Neil Bruce had earned the year before. Edwards’ $200000 salary reduction was dwarfed by a $5.61-million bonus paid out in company shares.

On average CEO salaries comprise just 10 per cent of their total compensation according to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. The majority of their pay comes in the form of cash bonuses and awards granted in company shares or stock options leading some CEOs to forego their salaries almost entirely.

For instance: Murray Edwards the billionaire co-owner of the Calgary Flames and chairman of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. received a salary of just $1 for his role at the crude oil and natural gas company in 2020. Through cash bonuses and shares though he earned $13.56-million.

David Macdonald a senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives calls it the “golden cushion.” Regardless of salary executives amass fortunes on bonuses alone. The pay structure is designed so that it’s “extraordinarily difficult” for an executive not to receive massive bonuses he says.

“While it looks good to forgo part of your salary during COVID-19 from a public-relations perspective it doesn’t impact pay” said Macdonald.

SNC-Lavalin in a statement to the Star said its CEO’s pay increase was the result of a “rigorous benchmark study on salary versus other similar global organizations.” Through a process called peer benchmarking the company’s board of directors hired outside consultants to compare SNC-Lavalin to a pool of others in the same industry and allocate pay accordingly.

This is typical of how public companies decide executive compensation explains Richard Leblanc a professor of governance law and ethics at York University.

The board recommends executive compensation based on the average earnings of their peers and will often recommend above-average pay as a positive signal to its shareholders.

“Even when performance goes down CEO pay will go up because the system doesn’t account for the actual performance of the company’s CEO. It’s just looking at what their peers are making” said Leblanc.

And the board committees that examine peer benchmarking studies have very little oversight Leblanc adds. Compensation committees can compare their company to others that are bigger and more complex while offering their CEO comparable pay regardless.

“You’re pretty much guaranteed to get higher compensation this way” says Macdonald. “You can bankrupt the company and you’ll probably still receive a bonus.”

Four other oil and gas companies the Star examined — Enbridge Parkland Fuel Cenovus Energy and Ensign Energy Services — all increased bonuses for their CEOs despite the industry’s overall downturn.

In a statement to the Star a Cenovus spokesperson noted that more than half the CEOs in the company’s pool of peer companies received higher compensation than company CEO Alex Pourbaix.

Enbridge in a statement noted that the company delivered strong financial results in 2020 despite the impact of COVID-19 and the company reduced costs — including CEO Al Monaco’s pay cut — “to avoid company-wide layoffs.”

A spokesperson for Parkland Fuel said the company’s steps to lower costs including the salary cut “delivered excellent performance through one of the most challenging years.”

Ensign Energy and Canadian Natural Resources did not respond to the Star’s requests for comment.

Some CEOs argue they deserve the raise given the drastic situation. Across most industries companies have faced unprecedented pressure in turbulent economic circumstances.

Despite the pandemic with Entwistle at the helm Telus reported strong year-end results for 2020. Operating revenues totalled $4.06 billion up from $3.86 billion and the company added 253000 new customers in the final quarter.

But even after donating a quarter of his salary Entwistle emerged from 2020 as Canada’s top-paid telecom executive earning $16.04-million in 2020 — a 24 per cent increase from $12.92-million in 2019 company records show.

The bulk of his compensation came in the form of stock option and share awards which increased to $12.86-million in 2020 from $9.98-million in 2019 due to the company’s performance and “Darren’s exceptional leadership” a recent company report reads.

“Some CEOs are saying that ‘even when performance is down we’re still working hard. It’s a pandemic it’s a work-from-home environment and we should be paid what we’re worth’” said Leblanc. “There’s fatigue exhaustion and the challenges of managing a workforce from home. In a pandemic the boards don’t want to underpay the CEO and potentially search for a replacement.”

But the gap between CEO pay and the average worker’s income has been growing for decades. According to a CCPA report CEOs make more than 200 times the average Canadian income of $48700. The average CEO makes in four days what the average Canadian worker makes in one year.

Lululemon Athletica in a note to shareholders estimated that CEO Calvin McDonald earned 714 times the amount of the company’s median employee in 2020. Despite a salary reduction at the pandemic’s outset McDonald earned $10.59-million in the fiscal year.

The compensation system is structured to exacerbate this divide says the CCPA’s David Macdonald. Without regulatory intervention executive pay will continue to grow — sometimes as a reward for reducing company expenses through measures like layoffs or pay reduction.

“There’s unlimited upside for CEOs with very limited downside” Macdonald said.

Dias whose union represents 310000 workers in industries ranging from manufacturing to forestry says there’s no justification for raises when workers are struggling to make ends meet.

“It’s just greedy” he said. “They make so much more than the average employee to begin with — why do they need more?”

One bettor's big decision for $1.7 million,"Open Extended Reactions

Wayne Shelton walked into Paycom Center on Tuesday for his first ever NBA playoff game. It was Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Shelton a single father of one and owner of a real estate appraisal business in Phoenix Arizona is ""nervous as hell."" Over the past year he's become one of the Thunder's biggest supporters -- not for sentimental reasons but because the team may help him cash the parlay of a lifetime.

Shelton avidly watches and bets on sports often using multiple screens to keep up with all of the action. However his method for sports betting isn't exactly conventional: He largely only bets futures very rarely dabbling in day-to-day betting.

""I plant seeds throughout the year"" Shelton told ESPN. ""I bet all the major sports for all the futures divisions whatever. And the whole idea is I'll invest a decent amount but now I get to enjoy the entire season as a sports bettor without having to put more money down. I can enjoy what I invested and enjoy every game because they all matter.""

So over one year ago May 1 2023 when DraftKings offered him a high-limit 50% profit boost he knew he had to take a shot.

Shelton noticed that the Texas Rangers had an outrageously positive run differential a month into the MLB season and on that day believed they were a better shot to win the World Series than their 22-1 odds suggested. He began his process of ""research"" -- but for the purposes of this new bet that term will be used loosely. A family member whose family was ""not really into sports"" started following the Kansas City Chiefs so Shelton felt betting a repeat for the reigning champs could be fun at +600.

Then there was the Thunder who Shelton believed showed potential after a feisty outing as the 10-seed in the play-in tournament. At 70-1 to win in 2024 OKC was the final piece of Shelton's puzzle.

He packaged the three championship futures into a $100 parlay to build a new futures ticket. The payout: $1.7 million.

""I never bet that high on a future especially a lottery ticket like this one"" Shelton said. ""They gave me a high max and I just said 'You know what? This one time max it out let's go.' [I] never do that. [And] here we are.""

In November the Rangers won their first World Series in franchise history. In February the Chiefs repeated as Super Bowl champions. Now the Thunder the Western Conference's No. 1 seed are three series wins away from capturing the franchise's first NBA title since moving to Oklahoma City.

""Most people would prefer to [bet] day-to-day and that's because you get your payout immediately"" Shelton said. ""For someone that does it like me you have to be willing to invest. You have to know you are not going to get paid tomorrow. It's been a year since I made the ticket and I've just enjoyed the ride.""

Shelton aims to have 40 futures tickets active at any given time so he's generally familiar with the options available to him to maximize his profit. However with so much money on the line this time (his previous biggest win was $7000) he has had to think about it a little harder.

The most traditional method is hedging which he did ahead of the Dallas-Oklahoma City series to the tune of a $10000 payout should the Mavericks win. He said he will ""probably"" hedge each round if the Thunder continue to win.

Additionally like all major sportsbooks DraftKings offered a cash out on the wager but at around $75000 following OKC's opening round series win Shelton didn't believe the value aligned and started looking at his options to cash out elsewhere.

After the Super Bowl reports emerged of a betting ticket that was just a Thunder title win away from cashing $1.7 million. Travis Geiger's ears instantly perked up.

About four years prior Geiger Zach Doctor and Guy Dotan all alumni of UCLA founded WagerWire a secondary betting ticket exchange born out of the founders' desires for a place to buy into each other's action. While the company isn't the first of its kind -- PropSwap for example launched in 2015 -- Geiger and his co-founders believe they got in early on something that could become a staple of the betting industry.

""This is not only a way for you to ride with your friends but a way for you to play it like an asset that you're more familiar with like a pair of sneakers like crypto like a stock"" Geiger told ESPN. ""It takes what was a risk class and makes it an asset class. If you game it all the way out it creates a secondary market and as we know secondary markets are kind of an inevitability of capitalism.""

Users sync their sportsbook accounts with WagerWire populating their wagers in the app's system. From there they can shop their bet around to other users or wait for offers to come in. They can of course purchase other users' wagers as well.

The app's bet value calculator tells users how much a given ticket is worth based on the original odds/payout and the probability of it cashing based on events that have already occurred. In Shelton's case WagerWire valued the ticket at just over $180000 ahead of the Thunder's series against the Mavericks.

Expected payout for Shelton's ticket If the Thunder ... Expected Value of Ticket After Game 1 of Thunder-Mavs $228613 Advance to Western Conference finals $330366 Advance to NBA Finals $720420 According to WagerWire calculations.

Geiger wanted the opportunity to land this ticket on WagerWire as it would be the biggest bet the platform ever handled. He reached out to the purported ticket holder -- only it wasn't Shelton but instead a 23-year-old named Sean Koehler who attempted to co-opt the internet fame by claiming the ticket was his.

Shelton caught wind of the scheme and contacted Koehler who admitted to duping media outlets. Shelton eventually verified the bet was his by syncing his DraftKings account in WagerWire. DraftKings declined to comment for this story but confirmed the legitimacy of the ticket.

Though Shelton wasn't sure if he even wanted to sell he listed the ticket on the platform to keep all his options open.

Right now WagerWire makes its money by splitting ""nominal"" buyer transaction fees with sportsbooks which vary from operator to operator. For big transactions like Shelton's -- as well as that of Martwon Weaver who sold a $680960 NFL awards parlay that ultimately lost for $25000 -- the company waives its fees.

The sportsbooks handle all of the actual transferring of wagers -- a feature that keeps the secondary market compliant with betting laws.

""The PropSwap transaction relates to what the holder of the sportsbook ticket wants to do with that piece of paper which is now really a contract between the player and the book"" Nevada attorney Dan Reaser told ESPN about PropSwap in 2017. ""It is not the business of taking wagers to facilitate someone buying or selling that contract.""

Geiger feels that his company's product complements sportsbook's cash-out options which are inherently lower than market value to align with their own business needs. To that end it's possible that WagerWire and similar products could eventually directly integrate with sportsbook interfaces providing a more appealing alternative right in the apps.

It might eventually look similar to the secondary events ticket marketplace: If a user couldn't get the ticket they wanted at the original price they can pay a premium to get in later.

Finding a buyer willing to pay thousands -- or hundreds of thousands in Shelton's case -- to get in on the action can be difficult. This is where another company White Glove Bets enters the picture.

Self-described as a ""concierge service"" for digital betting White Glove Bets has a stable of ""high-level VIPs"" that ordinarily cannot deposit money at major sportsbooks due to the inherent risk they bring with their deep coffers. While they're not what you would call professional bettors these players regularly make six-figure deposits and wagers.

""They have that Type A personality if you will"" White Glove Bets co-founder Kevin Smith told ESPN. ""Many of them are business owners or at least executives that are pretty high up the food chain."" He added that many of the company's clients also work in the financial sector. Smith said the clientele is ""predominantly"" male bettors with some as young as 25 years old. Several have been circling Shelton's ticket.

One of the potential investors who has a particular penchant for futures was very intrigued by the final leg of the wager and expressed interest in buying it. Smith has requested that the potential buyer remain anonymous.

White Glove Bets set them up with WagerWire who facilitated a $100000 offer to Shelton -- who promptly turned it down.

At that time Shelton characterized it as a fair offer given DraftKings' cash out was approximately $55000. But knowing that the Thunder were likely to knock out the Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs he decided to hold onto the ticket anticipating a value increase. He also had some reservations about the still emerging secondary market.

""The first thing that was going through my head was 'Wow ok somebody is considering a hundred grand'"" said Shelton. ""If somebody's willing to offer me a reasonable amount above cash out I'm not going to ignore it no question. It's just that I have to trust the company that I'm talking to or the person I'm talking to and I just don't know these companies well enough to be comfortable saying 'Sure I'll do that.'""

Since then Shelton claims to have gotten several offers over $100000 though he notes that many of these including one for $200000 were not legitimate. Protecting the original ticket remains his top priority.

Still if the secondary market can continue to grow and be taken seriously it could provide the alternative to cash outs that high-end bettors have been waiting for: Only a ""super VIP"" could have the capital to bail Shelton's ticket out above the cash out value and such a buyer could also have the means to properly hedge the bet all the way.

""As [the big betting operators] become more corporate they have less tolerance for high-end VIPs"" Smith said. ""I'm not being critical of them at all or their business model.""

While the financial thrillseekers wait in the wings looking for that moment to make him a life-changing offer Shelton is just enjoying the ride. He says he might take a vacation and wants to meet someone famous if and when he comes away with the money but hasn't put a lot of thought into it because it isn't tangible. For now the betting everyman is staying the course taking his monumental decision day by day.

""My family has been supportive people online -- and there's a lot of them -- have been very supportive and that does help with the immense amount of stress that comes with this"" Shelton said. ""And when I say stress -- find like 30 different emotions bundle them up together and it's that way all the time. But I appreciate that and I appreciate that people haven't been harsh and cruel.""

On Tuesday night with Shelton in attendance the Thunder won the first game of their series. The new value of the ticket according to WagerWire is $228613

The international money laundering ring operated by exploiting the flight crew’s “trusted positions” and airport security privileges according to a complaint filed by the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.

US officials said the investigation had “exposed critical vulnerabilities in the airline security industry” and shone a light on the methods employed by drug traffickers.

Charlie Hernandez 42 Sarah Valerio Pujols 42 Emmanuel Torres 34 and Jarol Fabio 35 were arrested by agents from Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in New York on Tuesday.

They are accused of taking a cut of each shipment they smuggled through airport security checkpoints and onto flights bound for the Dominican Republic.

Prosecutors said the flight attendants who worked on different international airlines that flew between the two destinations smuggled approximately $8m in cash from the sale of drugs such as fentanyl over several years.

Code word ‘lotions’

They allegedly used the code word “lotions” to mean drug proceeds and referred to the smuggling ring’s drug-dealing clients as “los tigres”.

The flight crew all had a special clearance with the US Transport Security Administration which permitted them to go through a designated security lane at John F Kennedy International Airport with less scrutiny than normal passengers.

All four flight attendants have been charged with one count each relating to unlicensed money transmission which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

They have also been charged with one count each of violating airport security requirements which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.

Mr Hernandez of West New York in New Jersey and Ms Pujols from the Bronx in New York were additionally charged with a conspiracy count which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

Ms Pujols faces a further charge relating to bulk cash smuggling which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

Ivan J Arvelo the HSI special agent overseeing the case said: “This investigation has exposed critical vulnerabilities in the airline security industry and has illuminated methods that narcotics traffickers are utilising.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9ydHJlbmQuY29tL3Jldmlld3MvMjAyNC1ibXcteDUtbS1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi1maXJzdC10ZXN0LXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2024 BMW X5 M Competition First Test: Optimized for Imaginary Use Case,"Pros Pros Glorious powertrain noises

Brakes remarkably strong and easy to modulate

These days everything seems like a competition. Americans are obsessed with competition—keeping up with Joneses school rivalries—heck you could stream five hours every night for years watching nothing but competition shows about dancing singing cooking baking dating surviving restoring homes and cars or even battling robots. Perhaps in response to this Yankee fascination you can now only buy the BMW X5 M or X6 M SUVs in their most extreme Competition trims.

OK the real reason for this change is because prime competitor Mercedes-AMG only offers its GLE63 SUV and Coupe in their most extreme S trims. Buyers in other markets can still get these vehicles with less extreme powertrain and suspension setups. But let’s say you don’t yet have a gut that jiggles on bumps your threshold for kidney trauma is high and/or your local weather conditions or tax base mean you only ever drive on mirror-smooth roads. How would a BMW X5 M Competition fare in you know a performance and handling competition?

Drag Race Competition

First a quick recap of the hardware basics shared in our First Look: The M’s 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 gets help from a small electric motor mounted in the transmission kicking out a combined 617 hp and 553 lb-ft. Mercedes-AMG’s smaller 4.0-liter bi-turbo V-8 is 13 percent torquier producing 603 hp and 627 lb-ft. AMG employs an extra gearbox cog too with nine versus eight. Our test cars weighed in within a single pound on our scales and their straight-line performance was equally close. Each hit 60 mph in 3.4 seconds with the deeper-lunged BMW crossing the quarter-mile mark ahead by 0.1 second and 1.4 mph in 11.8 seconds at 116.6 mph. An Audi RS Q8 and an Alfa Romeo Stelvio Q4 Quadrifoglio would be photo-finishing with these two. That performance would put both this BMW and the Benz even with or ahead of any similarly priced Porsche Cayenne we’ve tested but well behind the way spendier trims with “Turbo” in the name.

Road-Course Competition

Braking performance is similarly spot-on with each stopping from 60 mph in exactly 104 feet. But BMW opens some daylight relative to its GLE63 rival by circulating our figure-eight test course nearly a second ahead in 24.1 seconds at 0.86 g average versus 25.0 seconds at 0.78 g. The max 0.99 g force our X5 generates in the corners is also well ahead of the AMG’s 0.93 g. Usually tires explain the difference in cases like this but here both vehicles were shod in Michelin Pilot Sport 4S rubber (although it’s possible their individual fitment specs could vary). Staggered tire and wheel sizes vary with the BMW on 21s and the AMG on 22s so we wondered if contact-patch sizes accounted for the difference. Nope. Total static contact patch area measures within 3 square inches with the Mercedes leading at 278.

So we can probably credit the BMW’s more even weight distribution superior suspension kinematics the consistency with which the brakes tolerated hard application and smooth trailing into the turns for lap after lap and/or a higher degree of stability control system tolerance for permitting limit-handling shenanigans without intervention. As for those other leading contenders? The Audi RS Q8 runs with the BMW the Alfa Stelvio Quad with the Mercedes. Our test of a base 2024 Porsche Cayenne weighing 580 pounds less than this X5 M matched its figure-eight time and hung on with 1.02 g of max cornering grip.

How Does It Work as Transportation?

As ridiculous as a 2.7-ton track car sounds that is the only use case that makes sense for SUVs as musclebound as the X5 M or GLE63. Toward that end our test unit featured the M Driver's package (S07ME) elevating top speed from 155 to 177 mph and entitling the owner to take a BMW high-performance driving course. But a savvy track-day buyer would preserve some tire and brake replacement capital by skipping both the $3100 Executive package and the $3400 Bowers & Wilkins sound upgrade. Soft-close doors a high-mounted and heavy panoramic roof and ventilated massaging seats are utterly anathema to a track car the massaging is nowhere near as effective as the best Mercedes or Lucid systems and the stereo struggles to shout down the glorious engine noises and the tiresome tire racket.

Considering this as a dedicated track rat also helps us forgive the X5 M Competition its horrendous ride and shortcomings including an automatic climate control that isn’t (fan speed remains adjustable) and its lack of basic amenities such as adaptive cruise control and lane centering (the button to select them is there but the features cost $1700 extra).

Is the X5 M Competition Competitive?

We’re still mystified by this vehicle’s purpose in life given that nobody is likely to track it. Why would they when an M2 costs half as much and is four times more fun everywhere? Frankly a more supple-riding X5 M60i producing the same torque and just 15 percent less power equipped with all the expected luxuries at $96245 makes ever so much more sense. And for anyone hellbent on spending 50 grand more the Audi RS Q8’s balance of luxury comfort and sportiness better suits the way these trucks will actually be driven.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy9jam1rZ253ZW0xcm_SATJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvY2pta2dud2VtMXJvLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Irish police make €3.6m drugs seizure in two operations,

The strike began March 30.

“The company demands that we accept a permanent second tier of health insurance for new hires and establishing expensive premiums for current workers” a union statement said after the company announced its threat. “ATI has been trying to divide and conquer the USW membership at our plants since locking us out in 2015 and probably longer. We have shown management at every step that our solidarity will not be broken.”

The day after the ultimatum expired the union organized a solidarity motorcycle ride to visit the picket lines in Vandergrift Latrobe Washington and Brackenridge of 20 to 25 riders. This Militant worker-correspondent joined up with them.

Retiree Skip Longdon former unit chair of Local 7139 here rode a motorcycle with a sticker saying “Thou Shalt Not Scab.” “A lot of guys on this ride are retirees but our hearts are still at the plant and we stand with the guys” Longdon said. “We still go to the picket lines to help out in every way we can.”

When asked why he organized the bike ride Keith Beavers president of Local 1138 in Vandergrift said “We wanted to bring the guys together to do something positive to show solidarity.”

Beavers said anyone who wants to help can “come hang out at the picket lines bring your family friends whoever it’s that kind of support we need. Hanging out on the lines talking with us about the issues and spreading the word is the most important — Solidarity.”

Bosses say workers have to give more

ATI spokeswoman Natalie Gillespie said the company’s old offer had “expired.” Their new offer she said among other things will reduce a lump-sum payment in the first year from $4000 to $2500. And she said the union will have to back off on health care and job security. ATI recently announced they took in $693 million in the first three months of 2021.

“Each of our business units must earn more than its costs of capital on a stand-alone basis” CEO Robert Wetherbee said. “The Specialty Rolled Products business has struggled to consistently meet this profitability threshold for some time. … So we’re decisively taking the actions necessary to fix it.”

While the company says they’ll offer some wage increases “we only get these raises if we agree to take concessions in other places” USW negotiating committee member Randy Denman Jr. from the plant said in a statement given to me. “I believe this contract will destroy our union cost us our health care and retirees their health care.”

A new Marriott property just opened in Central America that piques my interest…

Alaia Belize Marriott’s first hotel in Belize

Alaia Belize is a Marriott Autograph Collection property that just opened in San Pedro Belize which is in the Caribbean Sea. This is Marriott’s first property in Belize and it’s also the first four diamond resort on Ambergris Caye which is Belize’s largest island.

There are several daily flights between Belize City and San Pedro and the flights are blocked at just 15-25 minutes. Alternatively you can take a ferry though that’s a longer journey.

The resort has 155 guest rooms and suites ranging from studios to three bedroom villas. The average room here features 1200 square feet of indoor space and 900 square feet of outdoor space though that obviously reflects that the resort has a lot of larger multi-bedroom accommodations.

The property has plenty of cool amenities like Belize’s first-ever suspended rooftop pool and lounge five different dining concepts a spa a gym 1000 feet of beachfront access and much more.

Below are some renderings of the property (of course it’s anyone’s guess if the resort looks this nice in real life).

Why I’m interested in this resort

Often my relative prioritization of destinations comes down to where there are good hotel options either in terms of luxury or value. I’ve heard good things about Belize in general and it’s a country that has been on my radar yet somehow I had no clue this hotel was in the process of being opened.

So this looks like a place that could be worth visiting on a trip to Belize. For that matter it could be practical to travel to a country like Belize sooner rather than later given how restricted long haul international travel is.

Last year I had the chance to visit Calala Island in Nicaragua which is a Small Luxury Hotels of the World property associated with World of Hyatt. Now it goes without saying that’s an experience that’s on a completely different level given that it’s literally a four villa private island that’s all inclusive. If you haven’t done it and have the points I’d highly recommend considering it.

Four Seasons is also opening a hotel in Belize soon which is probably the Four Seasons location under development that I’m most excited about. The Four Seasons Belize Caye Chapel is expected to open in the not-too-distant future (it was originally slated for 2021 but that seems unlikely at this point) and it looks jaw-droppingly gorgeous. It’s located on a private island in Belize and it looks like the Maldives without the jetlag.

Bottom line

Marriott has just opened its first hotel in Belize which is Alaia Belize. This is a Marriott Autograph Collection property that features 155 rooms and it looks like a nice option for any Marriott loyalist who wants a beach vacation not too far from the United States.

I’m definitely keeping this hotel on my radar and look forward to reading some firsthand reports.

Anyone considering a trip to Alaia Belize? Or has anyone been to Belize in general and/or San Pedro and have any thoughts & tips?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3BvZXRzYW5kcXVhbnRzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzA5LzIwMjEtYmVzdC1icmlnaHRlc3QtbWJhcy1kdW5pYS1hbHJhYmFkaS1icmlnaGFtLXlvdW5nLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktbWFycmlvdHQvP3BxLWNhdGVnb3J5PWJlc3QtYnJpZ2h0ZXN0LW1iYXMmcHEtY2F0ZWdvcnktMj1zdHVkZW50c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Best & Brightest MBAs: Dunia Alrabadi Brigham Young University (Marriott),"Dunia Alrabadi

Hometown: Ajloun Jordan

Fun fact about yourself: During this last summer I hiked a 1 mile destination trail with 1100 foot elevation gain every day. It was hard to find the motivation to do it every day but hiking it with Jordan Rapp a friend from the MBA program made that challenge a little more exciting.

Which academic or extracurricular achievement are you most proud of during business school? I am proudest of being part of establishing a new STEM program within BYU Marriot’s MBA program. Coming from the Middle East I grew up wanting to leave a legacy. However as a woman I faced active pushback from my culture as I chose to move to the U.S. and pursue my education. A driving goal of my education was to prove that legacy is within the reach of anyone. Leaving BYU with this new program makes me feel that I have indeed left a legacy. I was so passionate about this project that I begged the director of the MBA program Grant McQueen to allow me to work on it even though I had maxed out the 21 credits I am allowed to take. It took a lot of research negotiations phone calls meetings searching through government websites and conducting surveys. I even took a risk of challenging some of the regulations and policies in place to see this goal come to life. This new program is huge for BYU because not only will it help BYU be more competitive with other schools but a STEM-focused curriculum will help future students learn hard skills like data analytics and coding to find better roles in the growing field of STEM.

What achievement are you most proud of in your professional career? It was becoming the lead test engineer at Digi International. After one year of being employed my development team was left with no test engineers. At the time I was the only engineer with testing experience so most of the testing responsibility fell on me. The company was interviewing candidates for the position and I started to think that maybe I should just ask for the position. It took a lot of courage to approach my boss to ask for more responsibilities especially after being only here for one year. However I knew that given my experience at the company I would be able to uplift my team and to grow professionally. During my time as a Lead Test Engineer I trained every single team member on conducting their own testing. When I left Digi International almost every one of my team members were knowledgeable in our testing frameworks and able to perform without me.

Why did you choose this business school? The faculty and the culture! I did my undergrad at BYU and because of that I wanted to go somewhere new for my graduate degree. This is why after being admitted to BYU and other schools I paid my enrollment deposit at a different school. However I chose to forego it in order to come to BYU. During my time at BYU I developed a strong appreciation for the faculty’s expertise but mostly for their huge investment in students. Having a culture of personal connections was important. Not only did I want to attend a top academic institution but I also wanted to enhance my learning by having professors I could connect with. For example Dr. Wilde welcomed me as a part of his family and for 4 years made everyone sing me the Happy Birthday song on my birthday. Having had that example I expected to experience it everywhere else but not every school is like BYU. Since I started my MBA I’ve grown close to many of my professors; a few welcomed me into their homes and got to know me beyond the classroom. One of them even offered to let me use his house as my wedding venue. The Marriott School of Business is more than just a number on the TOP 100 MBA schools. It’s the home and family of the brightest and most world-changing individuals I have ever met

What is the biggest myth about your school? “The culture is very competitive and cut-throat” Nothing can be farther from the truth! I can go on naming how every single one of the 110 students in my cohort went about serving and uplifting the other 109. I could go on about Sarah Wagnor who went above and beyond serving our program as MBAA president; Jamie Cropper who cased every single student interested in consulting; Matthew Goodson who quietly paid attention to everyone’s needs and constantly reached out; Jordan Rapp who was there to help on every single VBA project; Kegan Despain who is always happy to go with you on a photoshoot when you need a picture for the Quants and Poets Best and Brightest Award nomination; Matt Sabey who is willing to give you his whole supply of fun games for an MBA party; Ryan Brown and J Washburn who without hesitation take precious time to proofread my writing; Angela Smith who helped me maintain healthy eating habits; Spencer Erickson who is my career confidant and who I can always trust to be honest with me even when I don’t want to hear it; Carly Jo Lang who probably gave haircuts to 95% of the student body. Myth: The culture is very competitive and cut-throat. Truth: The Marriott School of Business is a synonym for family and that is in fact what we are.

What is one thing you did during the application process that gave you an edge at the school you chose? Just like how networking is 70% of landing a job networking is 70% of getting into business school. I made it a point to meet the MBA staff and give them a glimpse of the person that I am beyond the GPA the essays the resume and letters of recommendation. It’s hard for people to connect with a person on a paper and so I attended every prospective student event and enjoyed having relaxed conversations with the staff. Not only did that allow them to judge my ability to culturally fit within the program but also to connect with me on a personal level. I connected with Treavor Peterson the Managing Director of the MBA at one of the MBA Tour events and we stayed in touch as I went about choosing MBA schools. I also connected with Jason Hall the Recruiting and Marketing Manager and constantly involved him in my application process. I am very glad I did this! There isn’t a week that goes by without me going up to the MBA office to chat and catch up with the MBA team. They are easily one of my favorite parts about the BYU MBA program.

Which MBA classmate do you most admire? That might be the hardest question to answer! Every single one of them inspired me in one way or another but if I had to pick one it would be Juan Jorge Poemape. I first met Juan when we were in engineering school but didn’t know him very well. I am grateful to have gotten to know him better in the MBA program. Most of the time we as MBA students get lost in seeking our own success. Not Juan. Juan is constantly lost in serving others. He is always helping. Even before school started in 2019 Juan was on Slack helping everyone get ready for National Black. He took initiative to provide better documentation and resources for prospective and incoming students without being tasked with the job. Having personally struggled with resume writing he helped me improve my resume. When struggling with class concepts he was ready to hop on a zoom call. The craziest thing is that he probably won’t recall doing any of this because he is just that kind and selfless. While he might not remember I’ll never forget the example he set.

How disruptive was it to shift to an online or hybrid environment after COVID hit? It was definitely disruptive! We got the news that we were going remote on my birthday. It was a really sad day. How was an extrovert like me supposed to go without people? Was this going to be the last day I saw the 150 classmates who had become my dear friends? Was there going to be a graduation? How were classes going to be run? These are just a few examples of questions that blew up Slack as we expressed concern about the first pandemic any of us had ever witnessed.

Having said this BYU and the MBA program were quick to provide mental emotional and financial support to those who suffered from COVID. Professors and faculty made themselves more available as we needed to talk to someone. While COVID was a nightmare friendships started to flourish and many of us spent hours on Zoom and Facebook messenger reconnecting with family and old friends. The loneliness of COVID was actually the reason I started to get more in touch with one of my best friends Nagham Qanadillo who got to learn more about the MBA program and joined it later that year.

Who most influenced your decision to pursue business in college? It was Roque Monteseno one of my co-workers during my time at Digi International who later became a very dear friend who had the most influence on my decision. He was the perfect teammate and mentor. When Roque joined the company he immediately showed interest in me and my life outside of work. We worked closely together on various projects and would regularly eat lunch together. Roque saw my potential and was very supportive as he would regularly encourage me to apply for roles that excited me at Digi. Specifically there was one time when our team was without a product owner. Even though I’d only been with the company for two years Roque encouraged me to apply. Roque was so invested in my success that one time he looked at me and with excitement said “Dunia you should go to business school.” I laughed at the idea of an engineer turning into a business woman but Roque said “You would do great.” I couldn’t resist looking into the idea and it wasn’t very long after that I started my business school application process. Roque was one of the writers of my letters of recommendations to BYU and still remains a great friend.

What are the top two items on your professional bucket list?

Establish a scholarship fund that will be dedicated to women from the Middle East who choose to pursue their education in the USA. To teach as an adjunct professor; the classroom is my happy place and I’d love to have a constant connection to it.

What made Dunia such an invaluable addition to the Class of 2021?

“Dunia Alrabadi permanently resides in the part of the productivity curve most people only visit briefly a few times in their careers. She is always doing. Her productivity has left a permanent legacy in the BYU Marriott MBA Program. She helped lead an effort build an MBA STEM Specialization. She is an academic star (recipient of a prestigious Hawes Scholarship) who also builds culture. She is active in multiple student life roles—VP of outreach for Women in Management the VP of inclusion for the Supply Chain Association and the VP of recruitment for the Product Management Association. She consistently volunteers her time to serve the community and she embodies the BYU Marriott MBA values daily.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added more than 150 points since the last close and reached a new high. The S&P 500 index hovered above the 4200-mark early Friday continuing the uptrend that started mid-week.

In the M&A space the spotlight was on the blockbuster merger between once-rival cannabis firms Tilray and Aphria this week creating what is touted as the world’s biggest pot company. On the heels of spinning off its VMWare subsidiary Dell Technologies agreed to divest its cloud business Boomi to an investor group for about $4 billion.

However the highlight of the week was the deal between At Home and private equity firm Hellman & Friedmanand under which the latter would acquire the home décor store for $2.8 billion.

In a week that had a modest beginning in terms of corporate events healthcare behemoths CVS Health and Pfizer reported strong first-quarter results Tuesday morning reflecting the vaccination drive and COVID care activities. In the after-hours Activision Blizzard posted double-digit revenue growth as the game publisher’s user base rose to a record high.

It is claimed that the staff who quit to join Howden Group printed off thousands of pages of commercially sensitive information before they left former employer Guy Carpenter owned by American insurance juggernaut Marsh & McLennan.

Bradley Maltese a former executive at JLT Re led the walkout of 31 staff.

JLT was bought by Marsh McLennan in 2019 in a deal worth $5.6bn (£4bn) with some of its divisions folded into Guy Carpenter.

Guy Carpenter and Marsh Services launched legal action against Mr Maltese alongside Vijay Mavani Molly Wyatt William Abbott and Gayle Scott as well as Howden Insurance Brokers and Howden Group Services Limited according to High Court filings.

It is alleged that four of the defecting group accessed commercially sensitive information in the weeks before they resigned. An interim hearing took place on Apr 30.

Mr Howden oversees one of London’s largest privately-owned insurance empires.

Although the family name is steeped in insurance – his ancestors formed a brokerage to insure the transportation of precious materials from India – he started what is now the Howden Broking with “three staff and a dog” in a small office in the City in 1994.

Howden Group Holdings now employs 8500 people globally and manages insurance premiums of more than £10bn annually.

Guy Carpenter’s history can be traced back to the early 20th century and the southern states of America. Mr Carpenter’s eponymous business initially focused on insuring harvested cotton before he met fellow brokers Henry Marsh and Donald McLennan during a transatlantic crossing in 1923 and merged his business with theirs.

The legal row follows a series of similar wrangles in the US amid a wave of insurance deal making.

Guy Carpenter is on the receiving end of a staff poaching case in the US. The reinsurance division of Willis Towers Watson launched legal action in April after more than 20 employees from its Latin American team resigned to join Guy Carpenter.

Willis Towers Watson agreed to merge with Aon in March 2020. The tie-up worth £21.5bn remains subject to regulatory clearances.

Guy Carpenter and Howden declined to comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,

View the current offers here.

As travel returns now is a great time to use your hard-earned points and miles to fly to your next dream destination.

While you're generally better off earning points and miles through a welcome offer and category bonuses on top travel rewards credit cards there are certain cases when buying miles makes sense. If you need an extra boost to make a specific flight redemption for instance you might consider purchasing miles to top off your balance.

But there's another option to earn extra American miles for select AAdvantage Barclays cardholders. AAdvantage® Aviator® Red World Elite Mastercard® and AAdvantage® Aviator® Silver World Elite Mastercard® (applications are only available for the AAdvantage® Aviator® Red World Elite Mastercard) cardholders can participate in the Flight Cents program rounding up your card's transactions to the nearest whole dollar and effectively acquiring AAdvantage miles for 2 cents apiece.

Let's take a closer look at Flight Cents and see if it makes sense for you to earn miles this way.

The information for the AAdvantage Aviator Red and the AAdvantage Aviator Silver cards have been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

What are Flight Cents?

Flight Cents is a voluntary program through Barclays that allows you to round up purchases to the nearest dollar to get additional AAdvantage miles. If you're an Aviator Red or Silver cardholder you can opt in and set a threshold from $1 to up to $500 per statement period.

Once the program has been activated you will get 1x AAdvantage mile for every 2 cents that are rounded up to the nearest whole dollar for each purchase.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

Then at the end of the statement period these additional cents will be counted up and appear as a purchase on your bill. The miles you acquire through Flight Cents during each statement period will be added to your AAdvantage account.

Example

Here's an example of how Flight Cents works in action for the Aviator Red Mastercard.

Let's say you make a purchase of $4.01 for a non-American Airlines purchase. Normally you'll earn a total of 4x AAdvantage points for this purchase (no category bonus). However if you were to opt-in to Flight Cents the program will automatically round up this transaction to $5.00 netting you an additional 49.5 bonus miles (99 cents divided by two). Your total of AAdvantage miles earned is 53.5 miles.

Is it worth it?

TPG values AAdvantage miles at 1.4 cents apiece so paying for AAdvantage miles effectively for 2 cents isn't a great value. When Flight Cents first launched many cardholders (myself included) were able to earn AAdvantage miles at 1 cent apiece -- every cent you rounded up to the nearest whole dollar earned one mile. Now however the effective purchase rate has doubled in cost.

Still Flight Cents can be a slightly better value than purchasing AAdvantage miles outright. Even with a 50% mileage bonus purchasing American miles starts as low as 2.15 cents per mile.

Keep in mind that there are plenty of ways to earn American Airlines miles aside from buying the — the fastest is through credit card sign-up bonuses. For example the Citi® / AAdvantage® Platinum Select® World Elite Mastercard® is currently offering a sign-up bonus of 75000 miles after spending $3500 on purchases in the first four months of account opening.

If you're after bonus miles as well as Admirals Club access when traveling on American the Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite Mastercard® comes with 50000 bonus miles after spending $5000 in purchases within the first three months of account opening.

What are the other perks of the Aviator Red Mastercard?

There is only one Barclays-issued card currently available that offers the Flight Cents program: The Aviator Red Mastercard.

Besides Flight Cents the card comes with an annual $25 statement credit on inflight Wi-Fi purchases an annual $99 companion ticket after you spend $20000 on the card waived check bag fees for the cardholder (and up to four on the American Airlines reservation) and a 25% statement credit for eligible onboard American purchases. The category bonuses are fairly mediocre:

2x AAdvantage miles for every $1 spent on eligible American Airlines purchases

1x AAdvantage mile on all other purchases

Bottom line

The Flight Cents program is a unique program for select Barclay AAdvantage cardholders. However it's not a lucrative way to earn American miles as you're effectively purchasing them for two cents apiece. With that said if you need to top off your AAdvantage account for an award redemption this isn't the worst option out there.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vbW9yZS1uaWdlcmlhbnMtb3Blbi10by1kaWdpdGFsLXBheW1lbnRzLXNheXMtbWFzdGVyY2FyZC_SAVBodHRwczovL3B1bmNobmcuY29tL21vcmUtbmlnZXJpYW5zLW9wZW4tdG8tZGlnaXRhbC1wYXltZW50cy1zYXlzLW1hc3RlcmNhcmQvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More Nigerians open to digital payments says Mastercard,"A new Mastercard payments index has shown that 96 per cent of Nigerian consumers are open to emerging payment methods including cryptocurrencies.

In a research carried out on Nigerian consumers the company found that an increasing number of consumers in Nigeria are considering emerging payment methods such as wearables biometrics digital wallets and currencies and QR code in addition to contactless.

The Chief Product Officer at Mastercard Craig Vosburg said “The pandemic made us think differently partly out of necessity. To deliver the choice and flexibility that consumers need – and increasingly expect – retailers worldwide need to offer a range of payment solutions that are easy to access and always on.

“As we look ahead we need to continue to enable all choices both in-store and online to shape the fabric of commerce and make the digital economy work for everyone.”

According to the Mastercard New Payments Index 86 per cent of Nigerian consumers have access to more ways to pay compared to this time last year; 78 per cent of consumers in Nigeria say digital payments methods help them save money; 81 per cent say they are more loyal to retailers who offer multiple payment options and would shop at small businesses if offered more diverse ways to pay.

The Division President Mastercard Sub-Saharan Africa Raghav Prasad said “The world as we now know it has changed dramatically since the outbreak of the pandemic accelerating long-term shifts in consumers’ transaction and payment methods.

“We continue to work with our merchants fintechs and banking partners to rapidly innovate payment options that meet consumer needs while ensuring we drive financial and digital inclusion.”

During the lockdown in 2020 consumers adopted new spending habits to adjust to the reality of the time. Tap-and-go payments and online shopping became the new normal. This opened new opportunities for digital currencies and payment options.

As more people trade cryptocurrency it is becoming an asset for everyday purchases. Mastercard discovered that 65 per cent of Nigerians are planning to adopt crypto with 76 per cent noting that they are more open to using it than they were a year ago.

The research also found out that 45 per cent of Nigerian consumers plan to use biometric verification methods; 54 per cent of Nigerian consumers are open to using payment technologies such as QR codes; 73 per cent of Nigerian consumers are likely to use digital wallets next year.

Teachers who qualify for a loan of up to $500000 from TIP Friendly Society will benefit from a 20 per cent interest rate — one of the lowest on the market. They will receive a prepaid TIP Lifeline/ePay Mastercard to access the loan and which can be used at all points of sale ATMs for online transactions and anywhere in the world that Mastercard is accepted.

In endorsing the new product at a virtual launch recently president of the Jamaica Teachers’ Association Jasford Gabriel said such a benefit could not have come at a better time.

He spoke to the additional challenges teachers have had to face since April 1 2021 with a further reduction in pay because of the continued deductions as part of a five-year pension arrangement and an increase in the NIS ceiling. According to the JTA president the matter is further compounded by the fact that a number of teachers who had contracts until August 2021 were taken off the payroll in December 2020 and although JTA renegotiated a reinstatement of their employment contracts they were without pay for two months.

“So as we try to calm their nerves we keep looking for viable options for them to stay afloat and TIP Friendly has provided such an option. This means that instead of educators having to borrow from family and friends which puts them in an embarrassing position there is an alternative with dignity” Gabriel said.

In addressing the matter of survival during this pandemic period the JTA president lauded businesses who are using technology to take their products and services into the 21st century to benefit their consumers.

He said every business needs to be creative and find new solutions to retain and gain new customers. “The creative ones see opportunities where ordinary persons see challenges. Smart businesses which adjust their capabilities in the current situation instead of panicking are the ones which will survive.

“I know of schools that are moving ahead through technology and parents who ask to stay online when the island gets back to face-to-face learning because they are excited that technology provides an alternative way of learning” Gabriel said.

The co-branded TIP Friendly/ePay Mastercard which has been activated is facilitated by Alliance Financial Services through its agencies islandwide and is aimed at reducing face-to-face interaction while providing a COVID-resilient service to TIP Friendly Society members. EPay provides technological support and accounting systems.

At the virtual launch Gabriel was presented jointly with a personalised Mastercard by president of TIP Friendly Society Ray Howell; general manager of TIP Friendly Society Wilton South; treasurer of TIP Friendly Society Clayton Hall; Peter Chin president of Alliance Financial Services and Kavin Hewitt CEO of the ePayment Group.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyZWFraW5nbmV3cy5pZS9idXNpbmVzcy9sb3V0aC10ZWVuYWdlci1jbGFpbXMtZW50cmVwcmVuZXVyLW9mLXRoZS15ZWFyLWF3YXJkLTExMjQwNzIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Louth teenager claims Entrepreneur of the Year award,"A 17-year-old from Co Louth has been names Foróige Youth Entrepreneur of the Year for his business producing handcrafted wooden pens.

In the Best Innovation category 17-year-old Fiona Karkia from Co Sligo took the top spot with her design for a contactless traffic light system for pedestrians.

The Ursuline College student used BBC micro bit technology and PIR motion sensors to create the system taking inspiration from her walks during the early stages of the pandemic when she thought contactless road crossings would be a better option to avoid having to touch traffic light buttons.

""I’m in shock but I feel incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to take part in the NFTE programme"" Fiona said.

Still only one team could earn the chance to hoist the most prestigious team prize in amateur golf and it was the USA coming out on top 14-12 to win its third consecutive Walker Cup.

With abundant sunshine and a steady breeze off the Atlantic Ocean making Seminole play exceedingly difficult on Sunday especially on and around the greens the players faced a stern mental and physical test. The USA entered the day with a 7-5 lead which was trimmed to 8½–7½ after the GB&I Team took 2½ out of 4 points in the morning foursomes session.

The 10 afternoon singles matches would therefore decide the first Walker Cup Match played in Florida and the final result was in doubt nearly to the end. The USA eked out a 5½-4½ advantage in those matches to retain the cup.

“It was such an evenly matched contest and our guys were really fired up” said USA captain Nathaniel Crosby. “I've been blessed to be part of their lives here for a few years and it's been so great.”

Crosby’s counterpart captain Stuart Wilson of GB&I was proud despite the disappointing result.



“It's been a great weekend of golf” he said. “It's the Walker Cup after all. The guys have come out fighting and tried to acquit themselves as best they can. But hats off to the USA Team and Nathaniel for pulling the victory off.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vYm93bC5jb20vbmV3cy9jaGFtcGlvbnMtZGV0ZXJtaW5lZC1hdC0yMDIxLWludGVyY29sbGVnaWF0ZS10ZWFtLWFuZC1zaW5nbGVzLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Champions determined at 2021 Intercollegiate Team and Singles Championships,"Aaron Smith

Form Guide

A 2-0 Champions League defeat on Wednesday night not only saw Real Madrid knocked out of the competition at the expense of Chelsea but the loss means Los Blancos have won only two of their last seven games. To their credit they are unbeaten on home turf since the beginning of February and they'll be looking to move level on points with rivals Atletico at the top of the table on Sunday.

Sevilla's slim title hopes took a dent last week in a 1-0 loss to Athletic Club but a win at Real Madrid will see them go four points off first. The Seville side have won their last three on the road and Julen Lopetegui would love nothing more than to secure a win over his former employers. Yet Sevilla have struggled at Real Madrid in recent years and haven't beaten Los Blancos in Madrid since 2008.

Team News

Zinedine Zidane has issues at the heart of the defence for the welcome of Sevilla. Raphael Varane missed the 2-0 loss to Chelsea and Sergio Ramos has again joined the Frenchman on the sidelines. Dani Carvajal and Lucas Vazquez are also ruled out while fans will be demanding that Eden Hazard put in a star man showing after causing fury among the Los Blancos ranks having been caught on camera joking at full time of their Champions League exit.

Julen Lopetegui is sweating on the fitness of key duo Jules Kounde and Youssef En-Nesyri for the trip to the Estadio Alfredo Di Stefano. Both missed some group training this week but are expected to be fit to feature from the outset. Joan Jordan is another who will be assessed though he is unlikely to start.

Probable XIs

Real Madrid (433) - Courtois; Valverde Militao Nacho Mendy; Modric Casemiro Kroos; Asensio Benzema Hazard

Sevilla (4231) - Bono; Navas Kounde Carlos Acuna; Fernando Rakitic; Suso Gomez Ocamos; En-Nesyri

Key Battle: Nacho vs Jules Kounde

In the absence of Raphael Varane and Sergio Ramos for large parts of the campaign the experienced Nacho has stepped in to breach the gap in the Real Madrid defence this season and to good effect too. Whether at right or left-back though prominently at centre-back he has been solid notably in their Champions League quarter-final success over Liverpool.

Jules Kounde's stock continues to rise in Spain and links with a move to one of the Premier League's top sides are completely deserved. He'll have his work cut out in order to keep one of LaLiga's top scoring teams at bay - Real Madrid have netted 58 times this season - but the French youngster is more than capable of holding his own against Los Blancos. Indeed Sevilla have conceded just 27 times in LaLiga this season that the third best defensive record in Spain's top tier.

New Delhi May 9: Two ATK Mohun Bagan players - Prabir Das and SK Sahil - have tested positive for COVID-19 ahead of the team's departure for the AFC Cup group stage competition in Maldives.

The duo returned positive after all the team members underwent COVID-19 tests at a private hospital in Kolkata on May 7 before their travel to Maldives capital Male for the Group D matches beginning on May 14.

Under the AFC protocols competing players will have to have COVID-19 negative reports two days before departure from their home base. ATKMB are scheduled to leave for Maldives on Monday (May 10).

""Yes Prabir Das and Sahil have tested positive and so they will be left out. All others have negative results"" a source in the ATKMB team told PTI on conditions of anonymity.

In their opening game on May 14 ATKMB are scheduled to face the winner of the play-off match between another ISL side Bengaluru FC and Eagles FC of Maldives to be played on Tuesday (May 11).

But ATKMB will decide when to depart from Kolkata after Maldives Sports Minister Ahmed Mahloof's had alleged that BFC had ""breached"" COVID-19 protocols and asked the AFC to cancel the play-off game and postpone the group stage matches also.

The nature of the alleged ""breach"" by BFC is not clear. BFC had reached Maldives on Friday (May 7).

""We are scheduled to depart on Monday but we are waiting a correspondence from the AFC regarding the status of the group stage matches after Maldives Sports Minister's letter to AFC"" the ATKMB source said.

He said goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya will travel with the team despite his mother testing postive for COVID-19. Captain Roy Krishna will directly reach Maldives from Fiji before the May 14 match if the group stage games go ahead he said."

Why it matters: Pennsylvania's race between McCormick and Democratic incumbent Bob Casey Jr. could determine which party controls the Senate next year — and is a prime opportunity for Republicans to gain a seat.

Driving the news: Keystone Renewal PAC's first ad focuses on McCormick's time at West Point and his earning a Bronze Star while serving in the Gulf War.

The ad promoting the former hedge fund CEO will run for four weeks beginning on cable broadcast and digital platforms in the Pittsburgh Scranton Harrisburg and Johnstown markets.

McMormick's campaign aims to make his military service a constant theme in his campaign against Casey who's seeking his fourth six-year term in the Senate.

McCormick is making his second run for the Senate. In 2022 he lost in the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz who went on to lose to Democrat John Fetterman in the midterm election.

Between the lines: The McCormick ad's focus on ""duty honor and country"" echoes an ad his official campaign put out last week.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtcm9zdGVyLzIwMjQvNS82LzI0MTQ5ODc1L3N0ZWVsZXJzLXJvb2tpZS1tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stc3RhcnRpbmctcmlnaHQtZ3VhcmQtMjAyNC1qYW1lcy1kYW5pZWxzLXRyYWRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024,"The Steelers used their first two picks in the 2024 NFL Draft toward the continued overhaul of the offensive line by selecting tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier. Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vZmFudGFzeS9iYXNlYmFsbC9uZXdzL2FzdHJvcy1jaGFzLW1jY29ybWljay1yZWhhYi1zdGludC1vbi10YXAv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Jzc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9mYW50YXN5L2Jhc2ViYWxsL25ld3MvYXN0cm9zLWNoYXMtbWNjb3JtaWNrLXJlaGFiLXN0aW50LW9uLXRhcC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Astros' Chas McCormick: Rehab stint on tap,"Manager Joe Espada said Wednesday that McCormick (hamstring) could begin a rehab assignment this weekend Matt Kawahara of the Houston Chronicle reports.

(NELSON ALMEIDA/AFP via Getty Images)

Dave McCormick forged a relationship with Ray Dalio the founder of Bridgewater Associates in early 2008 and was rewarded with a job at Bridgewater after Dalio made $780 million on the financial collapse.

Much like his upbringing Dave McCormick the Republican challenger for US Senate in Pennsylvania can attribute his wealth and his career as the president and CEO of the world’s largest hedge fund to being in the right place at the right time.

McCormick served as the president of Bridgewater Associates the world’s largest hedge fund from 2009 when working Pennsylvanians were reeling from the financial collapse to 2020 and served as its CEO from 2020 to 2022.

A recent book titled “The Fund” by Rob Copeland is a biography that focuses on Ray Dalio’s rise as the founder of Bridgewater Associates.

It also shines a spotlight on how McCormick got rich thanks to the proverbial revolving door and his friendship with Dalio while he was serving as the Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs in 2008.

“When you look at something like the recession where millions and millions of people lost their pensions or were severely hurt millions lost their jobs and to hear that someone benefited during that time it’s heartbreaking” Darrin Kelly President of the Allegheny/Fayette County Labor Council said in in an interview.

McCormick began working under former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in 2007 and went to Bridgewater Associates in 2009.

During this time Copeland explained in his book that McCormick met with Dalio multiple times in early 2008 when Dalio predicted an impending financial crisis and at these meetings Dalio was encouraging McCormick and other officials from former President George W. Bush’s administration and the Treasury to print money in order to stave off a financial crisis.

Once the great recession started the federal government would heed Dalio’s advice and print trillions of dollars throughout the end of 2008.

According to Copeland Dalio was betting against the dollar by investing in gold treasury bonds and commodities as the government was pumping trillions of dollars into the struggling economy in the fall of 2008.

“While Bridgewater’s automated trading systems were positioned relatively conservatively in 2007 and 2008 Dalio himself ordered a number of manual adjustments so the fund would profit more heavily from an overall decline investment staffers there then recall. Throughout this period he had placed a series of bets that would pay off if central bankers printed money to revive the economy—the exact move he had predicted” Copeland wrote in the book.

Dalio made $780 million dollars in 2008 as Bridgewater Associates’ Alpha fund saw a 9% increase. Other hedge funds were witnessing 20% losses during that time.

Dalio then rewarded McCormick by hiring him as Bridgewater Associates’ president in 2009. McCormick would then go on to earn $21 million in 2021 as the hedge fund’s CEO.

To put things into perspective over 191000 Pennsylvanians lost their jobs in 2008 and 2009 and the state’s unemployment rate peaked at 9.3% in October 2010. Home foreclosures in the state skyrocketed by 173% during that time and over 44000 properties were foreclosed on in 2009.

All of this happened while McCormick began working at Bridgewater Associates.

“You look at it right now there are still pension funds that have not gotten fully back. There are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of union members whose pensions were literally wiped out or were taken to the point where they’re still not back. People are still struggling from that day” Kelly said.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in 2022 that McCormick and his wife Dina Powell a Goldman Sachs executive are worth between $116 million to $290 million and possibly more.

McCormick lived in Connecticut while working for Bridgewater and the Associated Press reported that he rents a $16 million mansion on Connecticut’s “Gold Coast” one of the densest concentrations of wealth in the country. The mansion includes a 1500-bottle wine cellar an elevator and a private beachfront resort overlooking the Long Island Sound.

McCormick’s wealth and lavish lifestyle are already focal points in his upcoming campaign against US Sen. Bob Casey.

Casey is campaigning on a progressive economic platform that includes supporting unions going after junk fees and going after corporations for price gouging during and after the pandemic.

Casey is also using his opponents out of state residence and wealth whenever he gets a chance to on the campaign trail.

“He doesn’t live in Pennsylvania. He lied about living in Pennsylvania. We know that and he continues to try to make that case that he’s living here” Casey said to supporters in Lancaster last month.

“So here’s a candidate who’s an out-of-state candidate being supported by out of state billionaires. We don’t want a senator like that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9jaGFkLXJldXRlci1iZWxpZXZlcy1tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stY2FuLWNvbXBldGUtZm9yLXN0YXJ0ZXItc25hcHMtYXMtcm9va2llL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chad Reuter Believes Mason McCormick Can Compete For Starter Snaps As Rookie,"The Pittsburgh Steelers made it an emphasis to improve their offensive line in the 2024 NFL Draft selecting Troy Fautanu Zach Frazier and Mason McCormick with three of their first five selections. While Fautanu and Frazier seem likely to start on Day 1 or at least early in the season McCormick to this point has been viewed more as depth across the interior offensive line. However NFL Media draft analyst Chad Reuter believes McCormick could potentially take over a starting spot at guard for the Steelers and believes the three rookie starters might be an improvement over last season’s offensive line.

“McCormick has the toughness and athleticism to take a starting spot from James Daniels or Isaac Seumalo. Yes that potentially means the Steelers would start three rookies on the offensive line but some Steelers fans might argue McCormick left tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier will quickly constitute an improvement over last year’s group despite their lack of experience.”

I find it very very hard to believe that the Steelers would bench one of Seumalo or Daniels for McCormick. While there were some down moments for the most part the two were steady last season and among Pittsburgh’s best offensive linemen. Seumalo in particular brings leadership to a line that will still be very young and it’s really hard to fathom McCormick getting starter reps as a rookie.

Now could he compete with Nate Herbig for the top backup job at guard and potentially win it? Sure but even then McCormick is likely waiting for an injury to get his reps. The more realistic scenario here is that McCormick serves as depth and potentially as the team’s backup center behind Frazier as they worked him out at the position before the draft and he becomes a viable starting option after 2024 when Daniels’ contract will be up. The guard market got expensive in free agency this offseason and Daniels might be looking at a number the Steelers don’t want to pay. McCormick becomes insurance against them overpaying to keep Daniels around should he want a lot of money.

The selection of McCormick was an awesome one to help bolster Pittsburgh’s line depth and add a bully on the offensive line and it’s continually been praised since the draft concluded. But given what the Steelers currently have at guard it’s just hard to fathom the team benching two experienced starters who have been good in Seumalo and Daniels for McCormick. That doesn’t mean McCormick won’t one day be a starter but I’d be shocked if it happened in 2024 without injuries."

It is also one of the busiest feeding a whopping 68 million people per day—about 1% of the world's population. You could say that Mickey D's is the unofficial cafeteria of the world. So how is it possible that there still remains one U.S. state capital that doesn't have a single McDonald's restaurant?

The chain currently operates restaurants in every U.S. state capital except in Montpelier Vt. which is incredible when you think about it. That means you can get a Big Mac as far out as Honolulu—even Juneau. But if you're looking for Golden Arches in the Green Mountain State's capital you'll need to keep on trucking.

Chick-fil-A May Not Be Welcome in This State

Make no mistake: McDonald's does business in Vermont. As of 2016 the franchise had 30 Vermont locations—not the strongest presence but at least better than North Dakota which has just 29. So what could account for McDonald's absence from Montpelier—culturally and politically one of Vermont's most visible cities? Vermonters over on Reddit have their theories. Some believe it comes down to the fact that there's already a McDonald's in the neighboring town of Barre. Another speculated that Montpelier is simply holding out for bragging rights.

McDonald's has attempted to set up shop in Montpelier before. In 1996 a Montpelier landlord Jeff Jacobs applied for a permit to convert a historic bank building into a McDonald's restaurant. Jacobs' request was denied on the grounds that a Mcdonald's at the proposed location (a busy intersection) would create traffic problems. Jacobs appealed the decision to Vermont's Supreme Court and initiated an $8 million lawsuit but neither case made it to court.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Jacobs' story is in keeping with larger trends in Montpelier. As Business Insider noted in a 2017 article on the topic Montpelier is better disposed to local businesses than it is to large national chains and so the fast-food giant's absence from the capital city is in some ways unsurprising. A case in point: nether of McDonald's top two competitors—Burger King and Wendy's—has restaurants in Montpelier.

Ultimately being the only state without a McDonald's in its capital does remain one of Vermont's calling cards. Bernie Sanders one of Vermont's most famous residents certainly has no problem tweaking the fast-food chain. It's not personal though. Just a Vermont thing.

The restaurant industry had a strong recovery in the 2021 first quarter. More patrons are going out to eat now that lockdowns have lifted in several states and restaurant chains are reaping the benefits.

McDonald's (MCD 0.37%) the largest restaurant chain in the world demonstrated this amply in the 2021 first quarter. Not only did comparable sales (comps) grow 7.5% year over year but they beat 2019 levels. Let's see how the recovery is going.

A huge jump forward

McDonald's comps decreased as much as 24% year over year in the 2020 second quarter when dining rooms were closed but that quickly improved to a 2% decrease in the third quarter and a 1.5% decrease in the fourth quarter.

In the 2021 first quarter total comps increased 7.5% year over year led by the U.S. with international sales just more than breakeven and the international licensed segment up 6%. Total revenue increased 9% and operating income was up 35% year over year. These numbers indicate a recovery from the pandemic and growth year over year as well as over pre-pandemic levels.

The burger chain's ubiquitous drive-thrus played an important role in the recovery and management quickly switched gears to invest in digital capabilities. McDonald's had a strong cash position throughout the pandemic which allowed it to make global investments in digital capabilities as well as ramp up drive-thus and delivery. McDonald's also continued to pay and increase its dividend an important element of shareholder value.

Considering the company's large global consumer base and that the pandemic is far from over a comps increase is no small feat.

A strong showing from its biggest market

McDonald's operates nearly 40000 restaurants most of which are franchised. More than a third of total locations are in the U.S. and the recovery was most pronounced in this market. Comps increased 14% driving the overall comps increase.

While the restaurant chain had significant success with new menu items a removal of several menu items made for a smoother drive-thru and delivery process. Higher average orders fueled sales and the company expects that to moderate in the second quarter.

Is growth sustainable?

One question that emerges from this is whether the growth is a backlash against lockdowns and if the high comps will recede as people have their fill of McDonald's. Also Q1 sales might have gotten an extra boost from stimulus checks. Can the company sustain double-digit U.S. comps growth and otherwise strong comps?

McDonald's comps are not typically high but they are generally positive. Q1 2021 revenue is about normal as compared to the 2019 results -- a 3.5% increase. That's fairly standard for the company.

The company is focused on its three Ds -- digital drive-thru and delivery -- as key growth drivers. Digital is especially important in developing a diverse set of omnichannel options. There are now 40 million active app users in the top six locations and millions more in other markets demonstrating why digital investments are important and that they're paying off. Delivery locations grew from 3000 to 30000 over the past four years or 75% of total global stores -- and there are 25000 stores with drive-thrus.

McDonald's is on track to open 500 new restaurants this year keeping its lead as the largest global restaurant company. There are still significant growth opportunities for more stores and increasing comps and McDonald's is a safe bet for continued growth. As it officially begins its recovery the future looks bright.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpdml0di5jb20vbmV3cy9teS1pZGFoby10cmFnZWR5LXRvLXRyaXVtcGjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,My Idaho: From Tragedy to Triumph,"IDAHO — What do Big Macs lamb chops and grapes all have in common? It sounds like the start of a bad joke but for Mindy Mayer this is no joke.

As a matter of fact it defines a life full of ups and downs.

Mindy Mayer's life was going in the right direction. She was one of the most successful McDonald's franchise owners in the Northwest.

""I got the opportunity to go to Portland and become the first woman franchise owner in Oregon"" Mindy says.

But life was about to deal her a major loss. Mindy's family including her husband son daughter-in-law and two grandchildren was on a floatplane tour in Alaska when a storm rolled in.

""About ten minutes into the flight the plane crashed. My son's last words were 'Mom mom look what I did to my family.' Because he knew right what had happened. So I have lost five members of my family.""

While recovering from her injuries Mindy knew she had to go on with life.

""I thought 'You know what I'm just darn lucky to be alive and I better appreciate it and figure out a new way to make new memories.'""

One day Mindy was watching a television program on sheep herding trials and thought it looked like fun. But to do it you need a Border Collie.

That's when she found Shep.

""I said 'I just need a new best friend'"" Mindy says.

Mindy bought a farm near Wilder and contemplated her next move.

""I wanted to get some exotic sheep for my Idaho farm because now there's nothing on the farm and my friend said 'Oh I think you should raise these sheep called Kerry Hill.'""

A while later another close friend told her about a winery for sale close to her farm. Now Mindy's in the wine business with a winery named after her beloved sheep Kerry Hill.

Mindy Mayer has proven that a lot of hard work pays off for any newly-owned passion. And that in life you need to take it one day at a time and keep moving forward."

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Over the course of a year Anand Venkateswaran went from being a journalist who covered decentralized finance to becoming a digital art maven selecting and buying art for the world's largest non-fungible token fund Metapurse via his digital identity Twobadour.

The Metapurse fund is estimated to be worth $189 million and is best known for its purchase of Beeple's ""Everydays: the first 5000 days"" NFT from the iconic Christie's auction house for $69 million earlier this year.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The co-founder of the fund Vignesh Sundaresan also known as Metakovan has previously said the fund spends around $250000 a week on NFTs.

An NFT is a cryptographic token that exists on the blockchain and can represent items such as art music and real estate. Each token represents a unique digital item and can't be exchanged for another the way a cryptocurrency can.

As part of a recent conversation with Insider Venkateswaran shared his outlook for the space as it experiences mass euphoria. He also shares the platforms he thinks could be long-term winners and his top picks from the portfolio.

Are NFTs in a bubble?

NFTs have surged in popularity in recent months. Within the last 30 days around $323 million have been spent on NFTs according to Nonfungible.com.

Eye-watering sales such as the $69 million Beeple piece has brought mainstream attention to the space. There has since been a rush of companies and big-name celebrities looking to launch NFTs of their own.

This sudden surge of interest and innovation has prompted several experts to warn of a potential NFT bubble including Beeple himself.

On Thursday a co-founder of Ethereum said the market for NFTs has become ""saturated"".

Venkateswaran agrees to an extent.

There isn't a single bubble in the NFT space Venkateswaran said. Instead it's more a collection of bubbles many of which will pop.

However the pop won't have the same impact as previous bubbles. It's more likely that many ideas just won't last Venkateswaran said.

""I think there will be these pockets of resilience of people and projects and categories of NFTs which have been building for a really long time now and have found this template for how to survive"" Venkateswaran said.

NFT platform winners

Venkateswaran is particularly cautious about investing in NFT marketplaces because there are already so many of them. His investing strategy focuses on platforms that will take the conversation forward.

He scopes out platforms that will be able to react respond and thrive even in a bear market.

If artists flock to a platform then that tends to also be a good indicator of its strength he adds.

He highlights three platforms he thinks could become leaders in the NFT world.

""I feel these three are definite winners in my book"" Venkateswaran said.

1) Nifty Gateway

Nifty Gateway is a marketplace to buy and sell NFTs which launched in March 2020.

""Nifty Gateway has a very very strong financial model and they work really hard at crafting those drops each of them designed to maximise the upside on every drop we have a lot of admiration for that"" Venkateswaran said.

""[Nifty Gateway is] top of your funnel when it comes to bringing in mainstream artists into this space typically it's flashy it's very vivid it's visible and it's a quick dip your toes into this ecosystem model which does not demand any larger engagement in the ecosystem which is beautiful.""

2) Async Art

AsyncArt is an art movement built on the blockchain. The art is split into various layers which individuals can own and change and then when they put it together it creates collaborative artwork.

""AsyncArt completely transforms the landscape of art"" Venkateswaran said. ""That has a very powerful future.""

3) SuperRare

""I feel SuperRare is here to stay"" Venkateswaran said.

What about legacy auction houses?

Traditional auction houses such as Christie's and Sotheby's are also entering the NFT space.

The auction houses are not too late to the movement Venkateswaran said.

""There is this very real possibility that they can leapfrog that they can learn from the lessons and the trends that they've seen in the past in other marketplaces and think about how they want to differentiate themselves"" Venkateswaran said.

The engagement so far from the legendary auction houses has already made a powerful statement about digital art Venkateswaran said. But the organizations will need to focus on technology to sustainably operate in this area he added.

Over the very long term no investment vehicle has been more rewarding than the stock market. Though there have been periods where commodities like gold have outperformed the broader market it's stocks that have led to the most consistent and robust returns.

That was until cryptocurrencies came along a little over a decade ago. In that time we've watched as high-profile digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC -1.54%) have skyrocketed from under $1 to about $54000 per token as of Tuesday evening May 4. Despite three massive drawdowns over the past decade Bitcoin has averaged an annual return in the triple digits.

But it's not Bitcoin that's drawing most of the buzz in the crypto space at the moment. That title belongs to Dogecoin (DOGE -1.41%).

We're witnessing a telltale pump-and-dump scheme with Dogecoin

On May 4 Dogecoin blasted past its previous all-time high of $0.44 set less than two weeks prior and pushed briefly above $0.60. That may not sound like much nominally but it lifted Dogecoin's market cap to as much as $78 billion. For some context here Dogecoin's market cap was larger than electric utility giant Duke Energy South American e-commerce growth stock MercadoLibre and about equal with auto company General Motors.

The euphoria surrounding Dogecoin looks to revolve around its lower transaction fees relative to the big two in crypto (Bitcoin and Ethereum) increasing real-world utility and the belief among investors that it has the ""best community.""

But I see things differently. When I look at Dogecoin I see a classic pump-and-dump scheme unfolding before our eyes. If you're wondering why I'm highly skeptical of Dogecoin here are a handful of reasons:

Its fees aren't the lowest: Enthusiasts like to point to its lower transaction fees relative to Bitcoin and Ethereum but fail to mention that cryptos like Nano  Stellar  Dash  Litecoin  and Ripple all offer lower transaction fees.

Enthusiasts like to point to its lower transaction fees relative to Bitcoin and Ethereum but fail to mention that cryptos like     and all offer lower transaction fees. It's not the most efficient network: To add to the above Nano Stellar Dash and Ripple also validate and settle payments quicker than Dogecoin.

To add to the above Nano Stellar Dash and Ripple also validate and settle payments quicker than Dogecoin. Extremely limited utility: Most businesses don't accept cryptocurrency -- that's a fact. But after eight years Dogecoin has managed to wrangle up only 1300 businesses worldwide that'll accept it as payment. Based on an estimate of 582 million entrepreneurs worldwide Dogecoin is accepted by 0.000223% of all businesses. Not very convincing utility.

Ongoing dilution: Approximately 5.26 billion new Dogecoin are created annually via block rewards paid out to miners. In 2021 this works out to outstanding coin inflation of a little over 4%. It's been over a decade since the U.S. inflation rate hit 4%.

Imagine your core investing thesis being based on hoping Elon Musk tweets today or mentions Dogecoin on Saturday Night Live.

Dogecoin's primary catalyst is tweets from CEO Elon Musk. Imagine your core investing thesis being based on hoping Elon Musk tweets today or mentions Dogecoin on Saturday Night Live. History is its enemy: To boot all next-big-thing investments that have gone parabolic in price always burst.

This has all the signs of a pump-and-dump asset that's going to trap unsuspecting FOMO (fear of missing out) investors.

Ditch Dogecoin for these smart stocks

Instead of putting your money to work in a literal joke of a coin consider buying into stocks that have tangible outlooks and serve a real purpose for society. The following trio of stocks would make for much smarter buys than Dogecoin.

CrowdStrike Holdings

The first stock that would be a much smarter buy than Dogecoin is cybersecurity specialist CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD 0.39%). Cybersecurity has evolved into a basic-need service no matter the size of a business or the state of the U.S. economy. That should create a steady double-digit growth opportunity.

What allows CrowdStrike to stand out from a relatively crowded field of cybersecurity stocks is its cloud-native Falcon platform. Built entirely in the cloud and reliant on artificial intelligence Falcon is designed to grow smarter over time at identifying and responding to potential threats. With the platform overseeing more than 5 trillion events on a weekly basis it's not difficult for Falcon's AI aspect to improve its detection and response efficiency.

We've also witnessed an incredible response from CrowdStrike's customers. In each of the past 12 quarters dollar-based retention rates have ranged from 123% to 147%. Put plainly this means existing customers have spent between 23% and 47% more than they did in the year-ago quarter. Also 63% of CrowdStrike's clients purchased four or more cloud module subscriptions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 which is up from 30% three years ago.

Best of all because CrowdStrike operates on the subscription model it generates robust margins from its customers. Even though the company is still in the relatively early innings of its growth it's already hit its long-term subscription gross margin target of 75% to 80%-plus.

Redfin

Another stock that's a considerably smarter way to put your money to work is technology-driven real estate company Redfin (RDFN -1.88%).

To address the elephant in the room Redfin has absolutely benefited from historically low lending rates and a huge uptick in housing demand. Record-low mortgage rates won't last forever so this will prove to be a dated catalyst for Redfin. But there's much more to like here than just low mortgage rates.

One of the primary differences between Redfin and traditional real estate companies is the focus on cost-savings without sacrificing service. Homeowners look to sell are facing a 1.5% listing fee while those who buy and sell through Redfin can expect a listing fee as low as 1%. That's up to 2 percentage points lower than traditional real estate firms. This may not sound like much but with home prices soaring Redfin is progressively saving sellers a lot of money.

Redfin also focuses on service personalization as a differentiating factor. Its RedfinNow package which operates in a handful of U.S. cities purchases homes from sellers for cash. Doing so virtually eliminates the hassles and price haggling that comes with selling a home. Further Redfin Concierge helps with staging and other home improvement aspects that are designed to get top-dollar for a seller's home. Concierge costs up to 2.5% the selling price of a home.

With the company more than doubling its share of U.S. home sales since 2015 (0.44% in 2015 to 1% in 2020) it's plainly evident that its cost-saving services and personalization are resonating with buyers and sellers.

Facebook

Finally you should strongly consider ditching pump-and-dump asset Dogecoin in favor of social media kingpin Facebook (META 0.93%).

With a market cap north of $900 billion you might be thinking that Facebook's best days are in the rearview mirror. Such thinking would be misplaced. At the end of March it had 2.85 billion people worldwide visiting its namesake site each month along with another 600 million unique visitors to WhatsApp and Instagram which Facebook also owns. Put another way 3.45 billion people or 44% of the world's population visits a Facebook-owned asset monthly. There isn't a social platform in the world that offers a broader audience for advertisers.

The wild thing about Facebook is it's not even operating at full strength. The $25.4 billion in ad revenue generated in the first quarter (up 46% from Q1 2020) came almost exclusively from its namesake site and Instagram. It's yet to meaningfully monetize WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger despite both being two of the six most-visited social sites on the planet. Facebook still has significant levers its can pull to pump up sales and profit growth.

Furthermore keep an eye on Facebook's ""Other"" revenue. This category includes projects like Facebook Pay and the sale of virtual reality devices from Oculus. This Other category saw sales growth of 146% in the first quarter to $732 million.

Unlike Dogecoin Facebook has a bright future with a tangible outlook.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbmRyb2lkcG9saWNlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzA4L2ZhY2Vib29rLW1lc3Nlbmdlci1iZWNvbWVzLXRoZS10aGlyZC1ub24tZ29vZ2xlLWFwcC10by1yZWFjaC01LWJpbGxpb24taW5zdGFsbHMtb24tdGhlLXBsYXktc3RvcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facebook Messenger becomes the third non-Google app to reach 5 billion installs on the Play Store,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbmRyb2lkcG9saWNlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzA4L2ZhY2Vib29rLW1lc3Nlbmdlci1iZWNvbWVzLXRoZS10aGlyZC1ub24tZ29vZ2xlLWFwcC10by1yZWFjaC01LWJpbGxpb24taW5zdGFsbHMtb24tdGhlLXBsYXktc3RvcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzkxZWNjNGI2LTRiYWEtNGI2Zi1iODZiLTE1Y2VjZjA0MDFmZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Creative destruction is the silver lining of the Covid-19 crisis,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

ARIA’s “Take Flight” display features hot air balloons with a soaring twist.

“Take Flight was inspired by the coming of spring and the idea that the change of season brings an uplifting renewal to the soul especially after such a long and challenging winter for everyone” said Marti Winer VP event productions at MGM Resorts International. “Our designers looked to capture those feelings as guests ‘take flight’ in our very own custom balloons. We loved the idea of using the openness of the lobby to convey the idea of bringing the outside in; however given ARIA’s modern and sleek aesthetic we also knew we couldn’t do a typical or expected interpretation of a hot air balloon. We focused on balancing pops of bright color with those more naturally occurring in the lobby and whimsy with structure.”

The Events Production team collaborated with the property’s Horticulture and Special Events teams to create the display which features five hot air balloons floating under a “sky” made of vibrant shades of blue and turquoise fabric. Complementing the brightly colored balloons are six exquisite oversized birds soaring above a grove of Ficus trees and floral beds in hues of red yellow pink and orange. Guests can capture their own spring renewal by immersing themselves in a photo moment inside one of the hot air balloon nests.

Other springtime touches found throughout the resort include 15 smaller hot air balloons displayed in ARIA’s North Valet Lobby. Each of the balloons scaled-down in size from their main lobby counterparts incorporate handcrafted seasonal symbols such as an umbrella with rain boots; a flower truck bursting with a colorful floral delivery; and a flower pot filled with sunflowers as well as 12 other fantastical designs.

Additionally an art installation designed exclusively for ARIA and titled “Unexpected Convergence” by Living Edge a local team comprised of Artist Aundrea Frahm and Floral Artist Shino Mullen will be on display adjacent to the ARIA Patisserie through May 31. Created with layered mirror acrylic resembling a glass lake that collides into a wave of jewel-toned silk floral the beautiful installation evokes the crashing of seasons as the world moves from winter to spring.

The lobby displays change seasonally and started with the opening of the property. “What began as a celebration of the December holidays evolved into a more frequent project with customers eagerly awaiting the change of seasons in ARIA’s iconic lobby” said Winer.

She loves working in the space because although it’s an existing space it has great flexibility. “It provides us an amazing canvas to work with for a variety of ideas. We use the defining structural characteristics as our jumping-off point and then design around that so we know the finished project will blend well with the space. For example the glass ceiling is a structural characteristic that not only helps define ARIA’s unique style but allows for ambient light to permeate the space and create different environments over each 24-hour period. In this design we augmented the ‘sky’ with satin fabric in five different colors used to create an ombre effect. We wanted to make sure that visitors at 2 p.m. or 2 a.m. were able to embrace the total feel of the space including the sky even when there is no natural light.”

In the second half of 2020 online gambling stocks were some of the hottest growth stocks on the market. DraftKings (DKNG -1.13%) started a trend when it went public via SPAC merger but Penn National (PENN -1.57%) Rush Street Interactive (RSI -0.48%) Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG) and Gan Ltd (GAN 2.50%) all joined the party by hitting public markets or making deals to expand in online gambling.

The euphoria that drove those gains is quickly being unwound in 2021 partly due to the sell-off in growth stocks and partly because expectations may have gotten too high for online gambling. Here's how you should be looking at the market and the leading stocks in the space.

Casinos are open again

One of the reasons online gambling stocks did so well in 2020 was because physical casinos were closed. People who wanted to gamble needed to do so online and revenue jumped as a result.

We haven't seen a decline in online gambling revenue yet but we are starting to see very bullish signs from physical casino operators. Caesars Entertainment (CZR -0.36%) said this week that weekends are essentially sold out and they are expecting a big rebound in revenue in the second half of the year.

If there are limited discretionary entertainment and gambling dollars to be spent a rise in spending at the casino could translate to less spending online. That's at least one reason online casino stocks have been down recently.

Online gambling is far from profitable

Investors are also starting to see that online gambling companies are far from profitable and likely won't make money for years. It's very expensive to reach new customers resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on sales and marketing and it's far from clear when these companies will report net income.

Let's take DraftKings as a proxy for the industry because it's the biggest publicly traded pure-play company in the U.S. You can see below that revenue is growing quickly but sales general and administrative expenses exceed revenue and losses are accelerating.

This could reverse course as the company gets larger and customer acquisition costs fall but that could be years from now. And with sky-high valuations investors have soured on the long runway these companies may have to profitability.

Waiting in the wings

What I'll be watching in 2021 is how established casino operators react to the online gambling market. Companies like Caesars MGM Resorts (MGM -1.48%) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN -1.52%) have their own online gambling operations and established brands. They will be able to use cash flow from their existing businesses to fund online gambling growth and if they take market share from digital players who are burning cash it could be bad for stocks like DraftKings Rush Street Interactive and Golden Nugget Online.

If stocks continue to fall we could even see these companies poach online gambling stocks to bolt onto their own operations. Las Vegas Sands (LVS 0.11%) has indicated its interest in buying online gambling assets in some form and that could be a possibility if stock prices fall.

Until online gambling companies prove they're sustainable long term I'm going to have a hard time betting on the industry. For now my money is on MGM Resorts translating its industry-leading brands and growing online gambling business into a juggernaut in the industry. And it can wait years for the online gambling market to mature something online-only companies may not have the financial flexibility to do.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm51d2lyZWludmVzdG9yLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMtYmV0dGluZy1hcy1hLXByb2ZpdGFibGUtaW52ZXN0bWVudC1pbi0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sports Betting as a Profitable Investment in 2021,"A few years ago sports betting wouldn’t have been considered a profitable investment. For starters it was illegal in the U.S. outside of Nevada under federal law. The Supreme Court overturned that law in 2018.

Now in 2021 a number of states have legalized some form of gambling and sports betting. With New Jersey leading the way $13.5 billion has been wagered in the state since the maelstrom of legalization began. The estimated total market size of $8 billion by 2024 is now projected to be double that amount by 2025.

Is Sports Betting Profitable?

According to the American Gaming Association (AGA) sports betting revenues amassed $576 million on $7.8 billion worth of total bets during the first two months of 2021. That was double the amount from the entire first quarter of 2020.

While many industries were slowed or halted during the coronavirus pandemic the rise in sports betting has been evident with myriad partnerships this year between professional sports leagues broadcast companies and bookmakers.

U.S. News & World Report named MGM Resorts as one of the top six “Best Sports Betting Stocks to Watch” in 2021. BetMGM the company’s internet gaming niche has been launched in ten states leading to twelve straight months of market share increases.

Legalization paired with significant capital investments is based on the speculation that sports betting will be highly profitable in the years to come. Analysts at JP Morgan backed that claim as they reflected on in-game betting or micro-bets which accounts for approximately 75% of total sports bets in the U.K.

While Forbes quoted an industry VP who claimed New Jersey Pennsylvania and Michigan could potentially dominate worldwide online gambling markets second only to the U.K. and Italy another insider stressed that just a few big companies would reap the most profits.

As far as gamblers and sports bettors are concerned however there has probably never been a better time to get started as the industry is set to expand exponentially.

Some Keys to Take into Account Before Investing in Sports

There’s certainly a plethora of information to take into account before you begin investing in sports gambling. The first question to consider is whether or not you want to gamble or invest.

The difference is usually in the way you perceive sports. Are you willing to spend a lot of time researching teams players trends and analysis? Is gambling a hobby or a profession?

The London Post recommends using statistical data to form the basis of your sports investing strategies. There might be injuries to consider that could highly favor one team over the other. Also one team might do well in a particular type of weather.

As you get started you could even pick one sport to focus on thus establishing some basic knowledge to build from as you learn more and grow. In that respect you might be able to discover some potential value from your wagers.

The ERC Program is currently open but has been amended in the past. We recommend you claim yours before anything changes.

Betting as an investment will take some time and it will require the absence of emotions and intuitions. You’ll need to use facts based on legitimate resources that you can then develop into long-term strategies.

It’s recommended to stick to a general investment rule where you never wager more than one percent of your bankroll on any single bet. With that in mind you’ll also want to make sure that you have the potential to win more than your wager.

These philosophies could set the groundwork for sports investing strategies that turn a hobby into a profession.

How to Start Investing in Sports Gambling

It’s easy to start investing in sports gambling. You just need a small bankroll which you can then deposit into a sportsbook of your choosing. Finding the best and most trusted online sportsbooks is another good strategy that requires certain research and patience of course.

Pay attention to which online gambling sites are available in your state or country as you will need to follow the laws of wherever you’ll be wagering from.

FanDuel (Flutter Entertainment) and DraftKings are the top competitors in the U.S. with a combined market share of around eighty percent. Outside of MGM rounding out the aforementioned best sports betting stocks of 2021 are Penn National Gaming Caesars and Churchill Downs.

Gambling companies typically offer a percentage of your initial deposit as a bonus. And then you can get rolling.

One of the most popular sports to bet on in the U.S. is football. Some states looking to legalize sports betting this year have their sights set on the start of the NFL season. You can use the summer to get started by following different training camps and ultimate predictions for top contenders.

Currently the MLB regular season is in play and there are plenty of games you could choose to place a wager on. Betting small amounts with a sportsbook whose odds align with your bankroll and other personal preferences is an excellent place to begin.

It might be best to pick your home team with baseball and see how they’ve been doing. For example I see the Philadelphia Phillies had an opening line of +123 for their next game against the Milwaukee Brewers. DraftKings is showing that same line.

The Phillies already won the first two home games in the four-game series. So going into the third game with that line is a perfect bet to get started. From there I might keep an eye on other teams in the National League (NL) East to see if there’s a similar trend to follow.

You can also bet on the spread of the final score in addition to the over/under for the total amount of runs scored in the game. In-game prop bets may also be available with updated lines.

Other sports are available as well. The NHL playoffs begin on May 11 while playoffs in the NBA begin on May 22. You can also wager on these games with a Moneyline based on who will win the game outright.

You may find that wagering on regular-season games for a few weeks—or maybe even a few months—is a good investment strategy to build knowledge and analytical expertise. Consistent wagers that keep your bankroll intact by winning a little more than fifty percent of your bets should be a daily weekly or monthly goal to get started.

What Is a Good ROI in Sports Betting?

A good return on investment (ROI) in sports betting depends on the gambler or bettor. A small bankroll might call for a betting strategy that is slow steady and safe. On the other hand if you have more money to work with you can maximize your earning potential by developing a loose strategy and allowing for the chance to reap bigger rewards.

Winning a little more than fifty percent of your bets is no easy task. But that should be one of your primary goals when establishing a decent ROI in sports betting.

How you get there is totally up to you as you find your niche and stride with whatever leagues teams and wagers acclimate to your investment sensibilities.

For example you may want to stick strictly with Moneyline bets when you are just getting started. Since each game is between two teams these types of wagers might give you the best opportunity to develop your knowledge and skillsets putting you in the position to win a fifty-one-percent betting ROI.

Then as you get better and your bankroll increases you’ll have more money to wager on things that contribute value to your experiences as a professional sports bettor.

Final Thoughts

Sports betting can be a profitable investment that takes time and energy like anything else. As you can see there is no shortage of information and pathways for success.

One final thought is that you might want to make it a daily habit to stay up to date with industry news sports analysis and differing lines from multiple sportsbooks.

If things don’t go your way at first don’t get discouraged. Losing is part of the game. It’s how you make up for those losses that count and you’ll want to keep your head throughout that process.

Keep in mind there’s always the chance that sports wagering might not be for you. Or you just might be the type of person who needs a little more experience than others.

So remember that for 2021.

“We’re talking with everyone” Fields said during a sit-down in a New York hotel just before he zipped to Teterboro Airport for a flight to Vegas. But with analysts assuring us that a Ford-Google deal is imminent it’s worth recalling the latest hoax perpetrated by a conscienceless tech media: that before long we’d all be dorking around town in the Google Car the famously Weebles-styled self-driving bubble.

The tech giant’s self-driving technology is real but the car itself is vaporware. Google says it has no intention of creating and selling its own car. As for an iCar from Apple only a gullible fanboy should wait in line. Yet Google didn’t even need to trot out familiar Tesla-esque promises to revolutionize the industry. All it had to do was putt around California in its little bumper car and its tech toadies did the work for them.

I’ve come to believe that many in the cynical tech media—your Wired your Fast Company—not only don’t care to get it right they don’t care if they’re wrong. With memories and attention spans measured in milliseconds the Internet means never having to say you’re sorry. If more proof were needed the Great Google Hoax shows that the extravagant soothsayers who cover Silicon Valley can never be trusted to get the automotive story straight. There’s only one narrative that fits one gospel with which to snare eyeballs and flatter their self-regarding consumers: Silicon Valley is Lord and Savior. Detroit and other hidebound corners of the earth are the Devil only much dumber.

The idea that the profit minters of Mountain View would spend tens of billions of dollars to become low-margin automakers was dubious to begin with. Why should they when they’ve finally found easy entry through the back door? Google is now rightly focused on licensing its self-driving technology to multiple partners. All it needs is a genius microchip and a wireless connection to open up shop in your car. Google never needed to build cars like millions of game pieces if it can be the invisible hand that shuffles them around the automated game board.

All Google needs is a genius microchip and a wireless connection to open up shop in your car.

As for cautious mainstream buyers they’re not likely to trade in their Ford or Audi or Toyota to take a flyer on a startup—even a Teflon-coated Apple—that has never produced or serviced a single car. Google the company that knows more than any other about our brand loyalties and deepest desires surely recognizes this. So it never mattered whether the Google Car was a utopian bubble their original retrofitted Lexus SUV or a red Radio Flyer wagon: The thingy on wheels was always a Trojan Horse for the software inside. A truly breakthrough fully self-driving car might be a different story. But some leading lights in autonomy from the nerve center of Stanford to engineers at Audi or Nissan argue that any Google edge in software and hardware is exaggerated or short-lived.

Thanks to the wonderful world of metadata that got Edward Snowden exiled Google (and Facebook and phone companies and the NSA) already has a great idea of not only what you do online but where you go who you talk to and how you live. For them the time you spend in your car is a critical node to fill in the remaining blanks. It’s a kill-or-be-killed opportunity to develop or dominate the networks that control automated cars and in-car infotainment. That includes the ability to sell you more stuff 24/7 from apps to content to a J. Crew sweater. Make the car fully automated and the human race is freed to stare well Google-eyed at paid content on the car’s ever-larger screen displays. Or to see a Chick-fil-A discount magically appear as you cruise past its interstate exit.

The thingy on wheels was always a Trojan Horse for the software inside.

But make no mistake: Nissan Audi Ford Mercedes-Benz and other legacy automakers will design build market and service the self-driving and connected car. Google’s contribution—for those who choose to align with the company—will largely be limited to the software code whirring behind the scenes or the stuff streaming through an interface. Don’t be surprised if automakers find ways to block tech companies from sharing the spoils in their newly profitable cabins. Bowing to customers’ demands for convenient smartphone links Fields says that Ford will offer Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in every 2017 Ford and Lincoln equipped with its Sync connectivity system. Yet Ford is also pushing its open source SmartDeviceLink software for phone apps—ironically to cock-block Google and Apple’s services. Big players like Toyota and QNX Software have already joined up.

Fields says that Ford will partner up where it makes sense and go it alone where it doesn’t. Ford intends to develop mainstream cars not just pricey luxury models that achieve Level 4 autonomy meaning the ability for drivers to sit back check out and let the car handle virtually any situation.

Ford is tripling its autonomous Fusion test fleet to 30 cars is testing at University of Michigan’s MCity simulated environment and got a license to test on public roads in California. It’s working with Velodyne’s Lidar system which Ford has experience with dating back to the autonomous DARPA challenge of 2005. Such Lidar systems pump out invisible illumination nearly a million pulses per second to create incredibly detailed 3D images of their surroundings. The latest dramatically scaled-down Lidar hardware Fields said “is literally the size of a hockey puck” making it easy to integrate into a production car.

While a Ford-Google deal is not yet fait accompli there are signs in its favor. Alan Mulally Fields’ retired predecessor now sits on Google’s board of directors. John Krafcik who heads up Google’s self-driving project is a former Ford engineer.",,,,,,,,,

MSFT,Microsoft,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA1LzA4LzMtcmVhc29ucy1taWNyb3NvZnQtaXMtbm90LWRvbmUtZ3Jvd2luZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Reasons Microsoft Is Not Done Growing,"These three business segments will be exciting to watch as this industry giant continues to dominate and expand.

Software giant Microsoft (MSFT 0.29%) is essentially the landlord of technology: Much of the world's tech depends on its systems for a place to live and work. While Microsoft is a long-standing blue-chip stock it also has quite a few exciting prospects for growth investors.

Despite the company's 19% revenue growth and 44% net income growth in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 the stock has fallen about 5% since it reported those results in late April. Looking to the company's future prospects this short-term dip shouldn't stop you from considering Microsoft for your portfolio.

Azure gaining on AWS

In 2019 Microsoft won a contract with the U.S. Defense Department to provide services to the Pentagon through its cloud computing business Azure. Microsoft beat out Amazon's (AMZN -0.40%) AWS for the $10 billion deal signaling that Azure is gaining on AWS as a market leader in the space.

AWS still claims most of the market share in cloud computing but Azure's revenue is growing faster year over year at 50% than AWS's at 32%. Azure's growth can be attributed to its strong competitive advantages over AWS on pricing and its integration with Microsoft 365 with special cost savings such as three years of free security upgrades for companies already using Windows Server or SQL Server. Over 95% of Fortune 500 companies now use Azure -- a dominant and growing position that Microsoft surely owes to the decades of trust built upon major American corporations relying on Windows Servers and operating systems.

Growth in the Azure segment is great news for Microsoft's profitability because the company's cloud sales are high-margin compared to its overall business. While Microsoft reported its commercial cloud gross margin at 70% as of its third-quarter earnings report (up 3% year over year) the company does not reveal its margins specific to Azure. It does however specify that Azure's margins are improving steadily as the segment grows.

Gaming going digital

Microsoft's successful release of the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S in late 2020 helped bring the company's gaming revenue to 9% of its total revenue. Hardware sales alone don't tell the whole story though.

Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass is like a Netflix for Xbox allowing gamers unlimited downloads from an extensive digital library of popular games for a monthly fee. The service has reportedly attracted over 23 million subscribers up 5 million since this January. Sony (SONY -4.04%) does not offer a service for its competitor console PlayStation that matches Xbox's Game Pass in terms of access to a broad selection of new exclusive games.

This competitive edge is important because Microsoft's growth in the gaming industry will likely be largely digital and subscription-based. In the third quarter Xbox content and services revenue (i.e. not including hardware sales) increased 34% year-over-year as its Game Pass became the industry darling. This focus on digital growth is sure to increase margins -- both Microsoft and Sony sell their physical consoles at a loss with the long-term strategy of securing loyal customers and recurring revenue through digital offerings.

The better Microsoft's digital gaming offerings get the less likely loyal Xbox users are to switch teams and pay their valuable recurring subscriptions to PlayStation or elsewhere. The network effects in the gaming space are powerful -- friends are more likely to play games together if they all use a service like Game Pass and the social aspect of modern gaming cannot be overstated.

Office moving to the cloud

The Microsoft 365 (previously called Office 365) software subscription suite enjoys a virtual monopoly in the office productivity software space with nearly 90% of the market share. Microsoft 365 includes traditional Office products like Word Excel and Outlook as well as newly popular products like Teams the free business communication platform. Teams has doubled its daily active users year-over-year to 145 million as of the third quarter.

A key point in the office productivity business segment is Microsoft's wide competitive moat. Switching costs which include factors like time lost retraining a workforce on new software translate to a significant competitive advantage for Microsoft. Additionally although Teams is a free product it contributes to Microsoft's competitive moat by introducing users to the Microsoft 365 software suite which makes up about 22% of the company's total revenue with higher margins than its traditional software sales and encouraging paid upgrades for additional storage security and collaboration among other Microsoft apps. These factors work together to help Microsoft ""land and expand"" new paying long-term customers through Teams.

And that's not all

Beyond these three business segments Microsoft has a promising future with LinkedIn its ubiquitous yet largely unmonetized professional social network. Revenue from Microsoft's Dynamics 365 which provides enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) software increased 45% year over year in the third quarter and has become a significant profit driver for the company. The stock has been cheaper in the past in terms of P/E ratio but its current ratio of 34 is well worth it for the company's growth prospects competitive moat and massive market share.

Amazon is pursuing a lawsuit to protest the Defense Department's selection of Microsoft's bid over its own claiming that political intervention lost AWS the contract. If Amazon wins that lawsuit it could throw a short-term wrench in Azure's relationship with the DoD. With that said Microsoft has a more recent $22 billion government contract in the works to provide augmented-reality headsets to the Army and the lost $10 billion in DoD revenue would not have a large impact on Microsoft's top line representing only about 6% of the company's trailing 12-month revenue. Investors considering getting in on Microsoft should nonetheless keep an eye on Azure's continued traction in the cloud computing space especially relative to AWS.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9yZXZpZXcvbWljcm9zb2Z0LXN1cmZhY2UtbGFwdG9wLTQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Surface Laptop 4 (15-Inch AMD) Review: Battery Champion,"Microsoft's Surface Laptop 4 is everything I'd hoped the previous version would be which is to say an excellent all-around well-made machine with a speedy AMD chip. It isn't the most powerful laptop around nor is it the cheapest but it's powerful enough for most people and wraps Windows in a package that competes well with Apple's hardware.

Same Package Better Performance

The Surface Laptop 4 looks like the Surface Laptop 3. Technically it's slightly thinner but unless they're side by side you won't notice. At just over half an inch thick (0.58 inches) and weighing only 3.4 pounds this is a remarkably portable 15-inch machine. For comparison that's half a pound lighter than the lightest configuration of Dell's XPS 15. (It's also available in a smaller 13.5-inch screen size.)

There's a new ""Ice Blue"" color option but most of what was good about the Laptop 3 remains unchanged here. The build quality is still excellent the all-metal construction doesn't flex or bend when carried and while it's not the easiest laptop to open with one hand it's manageable.

The 3:2 screen ratio also remains as does Microsoft's proprietary charging port along with one USB-C one USB-A and a headphone jack. I appreciate the latter two but it's disappointing that neither the Intel nor AMD Surface Laptops support Thunderbolt on the USB-C port.

I mention this mainly because both the Dell XPS 15 and MacBooks support Thunderbolt which means better connections to external monitors and faster data transfer speeds. Depending on your situation the USB-A port on the Surface Laptop 4 might be more of a win than the lack of Thunderbolt. At least the USB-C port can be used to charge the thing helpful if you carry an external battery capable of charging laptops.

What's different in this update is that you can now get both the 13-inch and 15-inch models with either Intel or AMD chips (this was previously only a luxury for the 15-incher). If you opt for Intel you'll get 11th-generation Core i5 or i7 chips. If you prefer AMD you'll get Ryzen 4000 series processors. If you're not sure which is best for your use case check out our laptop buying guide.

While chip updates are pretty standard for a new laptop release Microsoft claims these changes along with some other tweaks deliver not only better performance but also improved battery life compared to the previous Surface Laptop. I have to agree. Performance-wise the Laptop 4 is a huge step up. It runs circles around the Laptop 3 in every CineBench benchmark I ran. More impressive the new version doesn't get nearly as hot even when I was pushing it with benchmark tests.

I tested the 15-inch AMD Ryzen 7 4000 series configuration with 16 gigabytes of RAM and a 512-gigabyte SSD. As configured this model is $1700. That's roughly comparable to Dell's 15-inch XPS or the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The Ryzen 7 Surface fared well against the i9 Dell in benchmarks though of course the latter was faster (much faster in some cases). I have never tested the 16-inch MacBook but the Surface Laptop 4's results beat many of the MacBook benchmarks available online. It's worth noting though that if you're in the market for a larger laptop Apple is expected to release an M1-based MacBook Pro later this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0LXJhcmUtc2h1dGRvd24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft and Rare BOTH Killed Rare - Here's How,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNici5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0LXJhcmUtc2h1dGRvd24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmV3aXJlLmNvbS9taWNyb3NvZnQtb2ZmaWNlLWFuZC1taWNyb3NvZnQtc3RvcmUtbWlsaXRhcnktZGlzY291bnRzLTUxMTkxOTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Get Microsoft Office and Store Military Discounts,"What to Know Microsoft offers two types of military discounts: Microsoft Store and Microsoft 365 Family (the Office suite of apps).

As the vaccine rollout continues there have been thousands of anecdotal reports of receivers suffering symptoms of mild fatigue achiness and fever in the few days after dosage to the point where members of the public that do not suffer such symptoms worry the vaccine hasn't worked for them.

This news article was a review of a preliminary scientific report that had not undergone peer-review at the time of publication. Since its initial publication the scientific report has now been peer reviewed and accepted for publication in a Scientific Journal. Links to the preliminary and peer-reviewed reports are available in the Sources section at the bottom of this article. View Sources

Although widely publicized evidence for physiological responses to the vaccines is currently scarce in published literature. Giogiro Quer and Matteo Gadaleta of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California USA led an investigation to obtain tracking data for physiological responses to vaccine programs.

Using a smartphone-based app that reported physiological activities from smartwatches Quer and Gadaleta found that resting heart rate increases after receiving a vaccination especially those who received the Moderna vaccine previously had contracted COVID or were under the age of 40.

A version of the research paper is available to read in full on the medRxiv* preprint server.

In the United States two two-dose mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech & Moderna) and a single-dose vaccine (Janssen / Johnson & Johnson) are concurrently being administered to the general public. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that 69% percent of the nearly 2 million individuals who have received a second mRNA vaccine dose reported some fever-like side effect in the following days between perhaps as many as 53.9% of those started just a day after receiving the jab.

Mean and 95% confidence interval of the absolute individual changes in resting heart rate (in BPM) with respect to the individual baseline around the date of vaccination (day 0) for the first dose of the vaccine (a) and for the second dose (b). The cumulative distribution of the maximal variation in resting heart rate in the 2 days after the vaccines after the first (c) and second (d) vaccine dose.

Quer and Gadaleta's team collected data from over 4000 American citizens using the DETECT software a smartphone app that consensually syncs with a user's Fitbit or Apple watch device to record a participant's heart rate sleeping patterns and various other physiological functions.

Participants were those who had received at least one dosage of either the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines. All participants' resting heart rate was recorded from prior to receiving dosage the day of and the days afterward and were split into three age groups: <40 40-60 and >60.

After adjusting for confounding variables the research team analyzed the resting heart rates of participants to infer physiological symptoms to the vaccines.

They found that resting heart rate increased in participants perhaps up to as much as an additional 1.5 beats per minute after receiving a dosage. Average heart rate additionally did not return to normal levels until four days after a primary jab and six days following a secondary jab.

Although no difference in gender was observed previous infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the ages of participants did affect heart rate. Indeed individuals in the under-40s group had the most significant increase in heart rate and all those under-60 experience significantly higher heart rates than the over-60s group after the second dosage. Previous infection of COVID additionally was associated with higher heart rates though only after the first jab. Finally the Moderna vaccine was associated with higher rates of heart rate increase than the Pfizer vaccine and similarly this correlated negatively with age.

Normal activity and sleep patterns were slightly disturbed on the first night following the first dosage with the researchers noting a significant decrease in activity and an increase in sleeping. These returned to nominal levels by the second day after vaccination however.

This study provides comprehensive and easily accessible evidence of subtle physiological symptoms of the COVID mRNA vaccines - a slight increase in heart rate in the days following a dose with a minor increase in resting the day afterward. The authors are confident in their findings though caution that the Fitbit and Apple watch technologies are demographically biased with a strong bias toward younger users. Additionally the current vaccine rollout in America has targeted older and at-risk individuals rather than the general population.

However this wearable sensor technology has provided at least a glimpse at the effects of the vaccines otherwise overlooked. It may allow for future more in-depth assessments to be conducted on citizens in the future.

The Ontario government has officially expanded access to Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccines for those 18 and older at select pharmacies in hot spot communities.

In a Wednesday announcement about mobile vaccine clinics visiting hot spot workplaces officials also said Moderna vaccine doses would be expanded to pharmacies “this week.”

It said up to 60 pharmacies in Durham Region Hamilton Ottawa Windsor-Essex and York Region hot spots would offer shots to people 18 and older adding the program would be expanded throughout May.

“Participating pharmacies will be identified on the website as they begin offering the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and will continue to use their own booking system for appointments” the announcement said.

In late April a statement said a pilot project was going to launch on April 30 that would see 16 pharmacies (eight in Peel Region and eight in Toronto) administer Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines to people 55 and older.

“This is expected to expand to additional public health units later in May following evaluation of the program and as supply allows” the statement said.

The latest health and medical news emailed to you every Sunday.

However the Ontario government website updated its pharmacy listing information at some point on Friday to say there was an expansion of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine program to people aged 18 and older. It also reiterated the rollout of the Moderna vaccines.

“Most pharmacies book appointments ahead of time and some allow walk-ins. Check with the pharmacy before you go. Due to supply challenges certain pharmacies offering the COVID-19 vaccine may be out of stock. Please check with your pharmacy first” the website cautioned residents.

""My phone doesn't stop ringing after"" says Pharmacy Manager Sajan Patel.

The pilot project includes 14 pharmacies in Windsor-Essex each of which will receive 100 doses of Moderna each week over a three-week period.

The vaccine is being administered to anyone over 18 even if you don’t live in a hot spot postal code as designated by the province.

""As long as you are an adult 18 plus you don’t have to be in the same postal code you can book your appointment and take the shot"" says Patel.

Since May 7 Patel has already booked up his 100 doses but hopes to start new bookings once he receives his next 100 doses later this week.

Multiple pharmacies contacted by CTV News Sunday confirm they have also already used up their first 100 doses.

Among those who received their first dose this weekend is Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens.

He’s impressed with the uptick in supply — but would like to see more progress on second doses.

""Of course the second shot hopefully can give us maximum immunity to the coronavirus"" says Dilkens. ""And I think all of us want that second shot so we can start moving forward with the new normal in life and get back to normal.""

According to the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit 176618 local residents have received at least one dose of the vaccine with 13 per cent of area residents receiving both doses.

Ontario-wide more than 6.1 million doses have been delivered.

Sajan Patel tells CTV News once he gets more Moderna doses secured he will post to his Facebook page and expects the appointments to book up quickly.

""It feels great it feels great to be a part in the COVID vaccination and to be a part of this battle we are fighting against COVID"" Sajan says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL25vd3Rvcm9udG8uY29tL25ld3MvY292aWQtMTktb250YXJpby1yZXBvcnRzLXVuZGVyLTMwMDAtbmV3LWNhc2VzLXBoYXJtYWNpZXMtaW4taG90LXNwb3RzLW9mZmVyaW5nLW1vZGVybmEtYW5kLXBmaXplci10by1wZW9wbGUtMTgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVID-19: Ontario reports under 3000 new cases; Pharmacies in hot spots offering Moderna and Pfizer to people 18+,"Top COVID-19 stories and news

Ontario reports less than 3000 new COVID-19 cases 25 deaths

11 am Ontario is reporting 2864 new cases of COVID-19 on May 8 as Peel Region confirms a higher single-day increase in new infections than Toronto according to Ministry of Health data.

“Locally there are 803 new cases in Peel 684 in Toronto 285 in York Region 133 in Hamilton and 125 in Durham” Health Minister Christine Elliott said on Twitter.

Today’s increase is lower than Friday’s 3166 new infections – though yesterday’s data was underreported due to a technical issue – and down from the 3369 cases confirmed last Saturday.

The province detected 3424 new cases on Thursday 2941 on Wednesday and 2791 on Tuesday. The seven-day average for new cases is 3193 down from 3618 a week ago.

Labs in the province processed more than 47800 tests in the past day. The percent positivity rate is now 6.8 per cent compared with 7.3 per cent last Saturday.

COVID-19 has killed another 25 people in Ontario in the past day including one person between the ages of 20 and 39 and four people between the ages of 40 and 59.

Daily new hospitalizations in Ontario have been declining. There are 1832 COVID-19 patients in hospital down by 92 since Friday and 851 people in intensive care units – seven less than yesterday. Of the ICU patients 588 are breathing with the help of a ventilator.

The reproductive number (or R) which represents the number of cases a single case will infect is now below one at 0.92.

The total number of confirmed active cases in Ontario is 32888.

The province also reached a new milestone in the vaccination campaign with more than six million first doses given. As of 8 pm last night Ontario had administered 6023610 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.

In Toronto city officials anticipate that by the end of the weekend 50 per cent of adults age 18 or older will have received a first dose. To date 1379532 shots have been administered in Toronto.

Ontario expands vaccine eligibility at pharmacies in hot spots

11 am Select pharmacies in Ontario hot spots are now offering Pfizer and Moderna to people age 18 and up.

The province updated eligibility on May 7 according to a post on the government’s website.

Some pharmacies in Peel Region and Toronto are offering the Pfizer vaccine as part of a pilot program at 78 pharmacies. Previously people age 55 and up qualified to receive Pfizer at a pharmacy.

Moderna is available through a similar pilot program at 60 pharmacies in hot spots in Hamilton Durham Ottawa Windsor and York Region.

Government officials have said Pfizer and Moderna vaccine supply will expand to more pharmacy locations throughout May as supply from the federal government continues ramping up.

People age 40 and up are eligible to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine at pharmacies.

@OntPharmacists is pleased that after collaborating with the @fordnation & @celliottability govt the #pharmacy Moderna vaccine & expanded Pfìzer program launches today. Eligibility in these hotspots is 18+. Providing access to essential workers & other populations.#pharmacists — Justin Bates (@justjbates) May 7 2021

Whoa! Great news mRNA #CovidVaccines are now available in select pharmacies in Ontario for 18+ (with a secret website update?!)???

I wonder if this will also be made available at family practices… would be helpful for patient access.https://t.co/6xJt5acRT1 pic.twitter.com/0K4xz6UTHI — Dr. Jennifer Kwan (@jkwan_md) May 8 2021

After all what could be simpler than making a plant extract and stirring it into a glass of water?

In a world where oil and water do not mix plenty.Though its consumption by humans is far more ancient the first known recorded use of cannabis dates to the reign of Chinese Emperor Shen Nung some 4700 years ago. By comparison the science of cannabis is virtually in its infancy. It has been fewer than 60 years since Dr. Raphael Mechoulam and his research partners at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot isolated delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol or THC the best-known of marijuana’s psychoactive components.In the years since Mechoulam – now of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and at the age of 90 still actively researching the plant – has discovered many more active ingredients – of which there are hundreds all of them oils. Fortunately there have also been great advances in the science of emulsification: making substances that don’t normally mix in nature to mix in liquids.The primary way by which oils are made more readily mixable with water is to make the discrete bits of oil smaller. Much smaller. About 10-20 nanometers in diameter or approximately 1/100th the width of a human hair. Without such miniaturization cannabis beverages taste like... well cannabis an acquired taste at best. Now virtually all flavors are possible. The cannabis taste hasn’t merely hidden it’s vanished.Yet smaller alone is not necessarily better. In one famous early experiment manufacturers were able to get a cannabis-infused beverage into a can but were unable to get it out after the miniaturized marijuana got stuck in the can’s lining.Fast forward a few years and those myriad problems have been solved bringing the benefits of drinkable marijuana to a new generation of savvy consumers.For those who choose to enjoy the product cannabis-infused beverages are the summum bonum of marijuana research. Gone suddenly are the dangers inconvenience and social stigma of smoking. Gone too are the hazards of vaping – vaporizing the plant’s fumes – which based on recent studies are of particular concern particularly when mixed with flavored e-liquids.CANNABIS-INFUSED beverages also eliminate a major problem inherent in edible cannabis products: unpredictability. Absorption of THC from a brownie or gummy bear can vary widely depending on an individual’s metabolism the food they’ve recently eaten and a host of other factors. As a result the same cannabis cookie eaten by the same person might yield its effects in half an hour on one day and take several hours on another. The effects enjoyed with cannabis drinks on the other hand are far more predictable. Liquids are absorbed far more quickly than solids. And faster absorption brings a faster onset of action more suited to the social nature of eating.One perhaps unintended result of drinkable marijuana is its benefit to restaurants and other segments of the consumer food service industry. A food service trade journal recently estimated that restaurants make 30% of their profits from the sales of alcohol. So it’s no surprise that restaurateurs fearing the loss of customers who prefer cannabis over liquor have expressed serious reservations about legalizing recreational marijuana.Their bottom line is a stake. However now that such legalization is all but inevitable in Israel cannabis-infused beverages are poised to be an economic godsend to the sector which suffered the worst economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. (Nearly 20% of food and beverage workers lost their jobs as a result of lockdowns and other social restrictions.)Cannabis-infused drinks currently make up only a small portion of beverage sales in US states with liberal cannabis laws. But that portion showed a nearly 40% increase between 2019 and 2020. Israelis being among the world’s most frequent consumers of marijuana will almost certainly take to these drinks far more quickly.The cannabis beverage market was estimated to be worth some $1.8 billion in 2020. By 2027 industry analysts predict that number will skyrocket to $8.5 billion representing a compound growth rate or CAGR of 51%. By way of comparison the personal computer market makes an interesting contrast. Berkshire Hathaway’s Business Wire cites data from the International Data Corporation touting “strong demand” in the PC market. Saying the sector “has surpassed previous expectations” (in other words a good investment) it predicts a five-year CAGR for PCs at a surprisingly anemic 2.5%.With such growth cannabis beverages won’t just mean a boon for food services but for tax revenues as well. That translates into better schools more comprehensive healthcare renewed infrastructure and a host of other needs fundamental to society.Cannabis-infused drinks are an economic game-changer with some of the best-known beverage companies – such as Heineken and Molson Coors and tobacco giant Altria the maker of Marlboro cigarettes – among its largest investors.NOT TO BE outdone the Fortune 500 powerhouse Constellation Brands recently increased its stake in the Canadian marijuana leader Canopy Growth Corporation to the tune of $4 billion. And while alcohol and tobacco industries have earned a less-than-sterling reputation there is one thing at which they excel: making money. Forbes magazine reports that even Coca-Cola the $200b. beverage behemoth is rumored to be well on its way to making a product with cannabidiol or CBD one of the non-psychoactive components of the marijuana plant.There are other surprising big names getting in on the action. (Note to self: The next time two former Israeli prime ministers and a former US speaker of the House endorse a product invest.) The global conglomerates however haven’t yet cornered the burgeoning cannabis-drinks market. That makes the start-up scene particularly innovative and interesting. The large established corporations like enormous cargo ships are impressive for their size and power but they’re not particularly nimble. Cannabis start-ups though are more like speedboats: smaller but far faster in adapting to change.In the same way that US breweries were ready to manufacture and distribute beer the instant Prohibition was ended Israeli companies are poised to manufacture and distribute cannabis beverages throughout IsraelOne such lively start-up making waves of its own is the Sputnik Cannabis Group. SCG is led by a small team of repeatedly successful entrepreneurs whose goal is nothing less than “changing the way people consume perceive and enjoy cannabis.”That doesn’t mean they want to get everyone utterly and irretrievably stoned. They have a more sustainable business model: for their products to be enjoyed socially. The company’s product formulations express that social model by offering micro- low- mid- and high-dose beverages with THC content ranging from 2.5 mg. to 100 mg. After all one size does not fit all.Sputnik also produces a wide range of CBD-infused products the effects of which while not considered psychotropic are widely reported to produce feelings that both energize and relax without any of the side-effects associated with pharmaceutical stimulants or sedatives.The company recently partnered with Canndoc creating a partnership that is ready to roll. Canndoc is Israel’s leading cannabis company. It’s also the place where some of those previously mentioned famous investors have placed both their private funds and public faces in expectation of big rewards. Legalization in Israel is just a matter of time. When that time comes lots of people who enjoy the experience of cannabis will be doing so one sip at a time.The writer is a registered nurse with more than 25 years of clinical experience.

MDLZ,Mondelez International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vZWRtb250b24uY3R2bmV3cy5jYS9hLXNsaW1tZXItc25hY2stb3Jlby1yZWxlYXNlcy1za2lubnktY29va2llLTEuMjQ1NTc2Ni9jb21tZW50cy03LjY1OTgyMS9jb21tZW50cy03LjY1OTgyMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Edmonton News | Local Breaking,"NEW YORK -- Oreos are getting a skinny new look and its maker says the new cookie is a ""sophisticated"" snack for grown-ups that isn't meant to be twisted or dunked.

Mondelez International Inc. says it will add ""Oreo Thins"" to its permanent lineup in the U.S. starting next week. The cookies look like regular Oreos and have a similar cookie-to-filling ratio except that they're slimmer. That means four of the cookies contain 140 calories compared with 160 calories for three regular Oreos.

And since they're for adults Oreo says they weren't designed to be twisted open or dunked. That's even though about half of customers pull apart regular Oreos before eating them according to the company.

""If people want to do that it's clearly up to them"" said Janda Lukin senior director of Oreo for North America at parent company Mondelez International.

In explaining what exactly made them more grown-up she said that if regular Oreos are like pancakes then Oreo Thins would be like crepes.

Despite having fewer calories per serving Mondelez says the new cookies aren't meant to be a diet snack. Still the ""Thins"" name could be a stealth way to appeal to people who want to watch their weight without the stigma of being seen as a diet food.

There are currently no plans to sell Oreo Thins in Canada a spokesperson at the Mondelez Canada office said.

Canadian consumers were treated to the limited-edition Oreo S'mores in May and can look forward later this year to Pumpkin Spiced Oreos popular last year in the U.S. Stephanie Minna Cass wrote in an email.

Although the original Oreos started in the U.S. in 1912 Americans won't be the first to taste the Thins. The slimmer cookies were rolled out last year in China to address the company's tumbling cookie sales in the country.

Lukin said the slimmer cookies helped win back ""lapsed users"" in China or younger women who wanted something that wasn't quite as rich. In the first eight months she said Oreo Thins generated $40 million in sales.

During a conference call in April Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld had noted the success of the Thins in China and said the company would make them available ""around the world.""

The Thins could help the company's North American cookie business which declined in the first three months of this year. Mondelez said the Thins will be available starting July 13 and that they'll cost the same as regular Oreos.

Lukin noted that it took months for the company to perfect manufacturing for the Thins. Early on she said 60 per cent of the cookies were breaking but that the rate eventually came down to 3 per cent.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here's what that means for the leading maker of energy drinks.

Energy-drink giant Monster Beverage (MNST -0.68%) reported first-quarter earnings on Thursday May 6. The results were roughly in line with Wall Street's expectations but that felt like a letdown for a company that usually trounces analyst targets across the board. Market makers certainly took it that way pushing Monster's shares 5% lower on Friday.

A global shortage of aluminum cans played a role in limiting Monster's financial results but exactly how big of a difference did this industrywide issue really make? Let's have a look.

What's going on?

Monster's net sales rose 17% year over year in the first quarter landing at $1.24 billion. Your average analyst would have settled for $1.22 billion. Bottom-line earnings increased by 14% to $0.59 per diluted share. Here the Street view called for $0.61 per share. Given that Monster doesn't give analysts official guidance targets to work with I think it's fair to say that this report was broadly in line with expectations.

Management pointed out that aluminum shortages weighed on Monster's operations in North America and Europe. That's a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which has limited mining operations around the world and wreaked havoc on the supply and-demand situation on a country-by-country basis. The quicker a region is coming back from last year's coronavirus recession the harder it is to find aluminum at reasonable prices. On the earnings call co-CEO Hilton Schlosberg said that aluminum prices are up 84% in the U.S. and 71% in Europe compared to the year-ago period.

The metal is needed for infrastructure construction projects for the recovery of the auto industry and for a million other uses that drive aluminum prices higher. Even the true giants of the beverage industry are fighting this issue. Monster's global distribution partner Coca-Cola (KO 0.37%) for example closed down the production of less popular drink flavors last summer because of a lack of aluminum cans and some of the missing flavors may not come back.

What is Monster doing about it?

Monster is working around the North American and European shortages by importing aluminum cans from places like South America and Asia where aluminum shortages are less pronounced. Therefore the aluminum problem isn't limiting Monster's sales in any meaningful way. Net sales in the Europe Middle East and Africa region (EMEA) actually rose 28% in the first quarter outpacing Monster's global growth. The cross-shipping of extra supplies did add to the company's operating costs slicing EMEA's gross profit margins from 41.3% to 37.3%.

Schlosberg doesn't expect the higher costs to go away anytime soon.

""I expect that our margins will not improve as we go into the second third quarter"" he said. ""Possibly the fourth quarter I think things will be better. That's my analysis.""

Until then Monster's gross margins will continue to suffer from high aluminum prices and additional costs related to the company's workarounds.

What's next?

By and large Monster is going ahead with the same global growth plan that the company would have in a world with easy access to cheap aluminum cans. It's more important to grow the market -- and Monster's share of that market -- than it is to protect profit margins. Management is thinking about raising unit prices as arch-rival Red Bull has done but Monster may simply bite the bullet and rough it out for a few quarters.

So the road ahead may be a bit bumpy on the bottom line as the company focuses on growing its worldwide market reach. And don't worry about Monster's shareholders. The stock trades just 8% below mid-April's all-time highs at a generous valuation of 34 times trailing earnings and 10 times trailing sales. The aluminum issue is not a game-changing growth problem but a minor profit-related inconvenience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVuZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8xMzk5Mi9nZW5nLWFubm91bmNlcy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC13aXRoLW1vbnN0ZXItZW5lcmd50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gen.G announces partnership with Monster Energy,"Global esports corporation Gen.G Esports announced their partnership with energy drink Monster Energy.

In its new research paper Morgan Stanley contends that investors may be underestimating the near-term challenges of certifying eVTOL aircraft as well as the sector’s long-term potential. Morgan Stanley Image

The projections are contained in a new research paper that updates the company’s total addressable market (TAM) estimates from December 2018. Morgan Stanley’s initial report “Flying Cars: Investment Implications of Urban Air Mobility” predicted that the UAM market would be worth $1.5 trillion in 2040.

On the strength of the Morgan Stanley name that figure has since become a staple of investor pitches. It was cited in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings for the eVTOL developers Archer and Lilium as well as in Wisk’s recent legal complaint against Archer for theft of trade secrets.

The base case estimate in Morgan Stanley’s new report “eVTOL/Urban Air Mobility TAM Update: A Slow Take-Off But Sky’s the Limit” revises that figure downward to $1 trillion “as we made significant reductions to our adoption curve in the early and medium-term years to allow for a greater ‘margin of safety’ given our understanding of the certification landscape in the U.S. and Europe” the authors state.

For 2030 they reduced their U.S. TAM estimate by nearly 75 percent from $45 billion to just $12 billion which is less than Archer alone expects to make that year.

“Our mapping of the regulatory side suggests investors should assume ‘horizontal’ (pushed to the right) expectations of commercial introduction at least in the early years while leaving the door open for the ‘vertical’ inflection at some point in the future which we currently assume is closer to 2040 or beyond rather than 2030” the authors explain.

Once that inflection happens however they predict that eVTOL aircraft could be as transformative as automobiles were in the early 20th century and commercial airlines were after the Second World War. “Radical changes to transportation modality don’t so much ‘cannibalize’ the current/prevailing form of transport as much as totally re-invent and re-scale the size of the market itself frequently by orders of magnitude” they claim.

By 2050 they predict that the global eVTOL market will be worth $9 trillion — as much as 6 percent of projected global gross domestic product — in their base case and up to $18.9 trillion (11 to 12 percent of global GDP) in their bull case.

By comparison the automotive sector today accounts for only around 3 percent of U.S. GDP. Even in the analysts’ bear case in which there is “mass rejection/minimal adoption of eVTOL/drone transport of goods and people” they predict a global TAM in 2050 of $2.3 trillion or 1 to 1.5 percent of projected GDP.

Morgan Stanley’s definition of UAM includes “transporting goods” as well as “transporting humans” and transport/logistics missions account for 52 percent of its base case market in 2040 — up from a previously estimated share of 28 percent.

“Our view of the urban parcel delivery market is now considerably larger as we have switched our focus from last mile delivery of urban packages to end customers to middle mile delivery of urban packages from DCs to delivery stations/stores close to urban areas” the analysts explain. “This should permit quicker and easier penetration by eVTOLs while providing a much more powerful use case than air and truck today and unlocks [an approximate] $70 billion revenue opportunity around 2040.”

The report acknowledges that Morgan Stanley is not a wholly objective observer of the eVTOL market. Because the company “does and seeks to do business with” companies covered by its research the firm may have conflicts of interest and “investors should consider Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making their investment decision” it states.

The paper also contains some incomplete inaccurate and outdated information that raises questions about its authors’ understanding of the UAM landscape. For example it states that “companies such as Uber Elevate are constantly in contact with regulators to ensure a smooth transition from helicopters or airline flight today” to large-scale eVTOL operations even though Uber Elevate was acquired by Joby Aviation last year.

In addressing the safety advantages of eVTOL aircraft the report claims that “the number one cause of helicopter accidents today is engine failure” which is demonstrably false. Research by the International Helicopter Safety Team and U.S. Helicopter Safety Team has shown that accidents due to engine failure are much less common than accidents due to other factors such as loss of control which is a safety issue that the eVTOL industry is attempting to address through greater autonomy.

A Morgan Stanley spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question from eVTOL.com concerning the report’s inaccuracies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vcG9ldHNhbmRxdWFudHMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMDkvMjAyMS1iZXN0LWJyaWdodGVzdC1tYmFzLWhhbGV5LXBhcnJpbi1ub3J0aC1jYXJvbGluYS1rZW5hbi1mbGFnbGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Best & Brightest MBAs: Haley Parrin North Carolina (Kenan-Flagler),"Haley Parrin

Few moments made me prouder this year than hearing from a student that they were extended the offer that they worked so hard to receive and that the club was critical to getting them there.

What achievement are you most proud of in your professional career? Working with a start-up clinic and health insurer while a consultant with Optum Advisory Services challenged me to learn quickly and demonstrate empathy and excellence in the work that I did. I started as a sales operations analyst and progressed to leading an initiative to make hundreds of member-facing communications more intuitive and accessible. Earning increasing responsibility receiving consistent client recognition and having a real impact on peoples’ lives in such a short period of time alongside one of the best teams in healthcare was incredibly gratifying.

Why did you choose this business school? UNC Kenan-Flagler had the right combination of academic rigor and collegial community that I hoped to find in an MBA program. I wanted to be able to build my financial skillset while working alongside peers without sharp elbows. Recruiting for investment banking at UNC Kenan-Flagler produced some of the most meaningful friendships and professional relationships of my MBA career which reaffirmed my decision that the UNC Kenan-Flagler community was the best fit for me.

Who was your favorite MBA professor? Paige Ouimet Professor of Finance has a knack for illustrating corporate finance concepts in a non-exclusive way truly demonstrating what it means to educate and include students of varied interests and backgrounds in the topics that she teaches.

What was your favorite MBA event or tradition at your business school? UNC Kenan-Flagler MBAs have our own version of “Cheers” at a downtown Chapel Hill establishment. Many of us elected to stay in Chapel Hill throughout the pandemic despite classes going online. It’s been great to have a home base to meet up with classmates in a socially distanced way since we aren’t able to connect in the same way on campus.

Looking back over your MBA experience what is the one thing you’d do differently and why? I would engage more deeply in the Chapel Hill community. Living as a student in Chapel Hill is a fleeting gift and I wish I would have given more back while still a student. So much of my experience focused on professional development it would have been worthwhile to also spend more time in the community.

What is the biggest myth about your school? Gender parity at UNC Kenan-Flagler is lower than at peer schools but I never found it to hinder my ability to exceed my goals and have a lasting impact on the community. In fact the majority of student leaders in my class are incredibly capable and intelligent women. We lead clubs and organizations manage student-run investment funds initiate and guide necessary community conversations and care deeply about how this program is working to be more inclusive of all members of our community.

What surprised you the most about business school? I had no idea how many professional opportunities would be accessible to me as a woman in this program. If I had been told before business school that I would be transitioning from healthcare consultant to investment banker at one of the top firms in the world I would not have believed it. The UNC Kenan-Flagler program and alumni network allowed me to explore my interests in a decisive way to help me achieve professional goals that I did not believe were within reach prior to starting the program.

What is one thing you did during the application process that gave you an edge at the school you chose? I was myself – the most effective way to give yourself an edge is to know your story and be genuine in telling it an articulate and compelling way.

Which MBA classmate do you most admire? Je’nique Harewood is a courageous force who works tirelessly to make UNC Kenan-Flagler genuinely inclusive and leave this community better than she found it. She is one of the co-founders of the Black Business Student Association which actively engages our community in necessary conversations about race and how we as a community can act to create change at UNC Kenan-Flagler. She is a warm brilliant colleague who I am proud to call classmate and friend.

How disruptive was it to shift to an online or hybrid environment after COVID hit? The shift to an online environment certainly was not ideal; however the UNC Kenan-Flagler community demonstrated resilience in the face of an unprecedented challenge and leveraged its assets as a top online program to smooth the transition to online education. Students also found ways to strengthen relationships outside of the classroom which made a world of difference.

Who most influenced your decision to pursue business in college? Growing up I watched my dad make decisions as a business leader throughout the financial crisis and I experienced the impacts of many of those decisions as a member of his family. At the time I didn’t fully grasp the gravity of the situation but going to business school has put a lot of memories into context and given us lots to talk about. I am incredibly grateful that I have an opportunity to pursue an education because of the sacrifices my dad made throughout his life and career.

What are the top two items on your professional bucket list? Work internationally (preferably somewhere that I can leverage my French skills) and be in a position where my career supports me in dedicating time and resources to causes that I care about such as education for women and Parkinson’s awareness and research.

What made Haley such an invaluable addition to the Class of 2021?

“As Investment Banking Club president Haley led the club through a pandemic further complicated by a significantly larger cohort of interested students while investment banking internship spots were generally fewer. Evidence of the impact of her work is that we have a higher number of students securing investment banking internships than last year and we have students recruited to premier Wall Street firms such as Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley J.P. Morgan and Evercore.

Haley went above and beyond typical Investment Banking club president duties and took the lead on collaborating with the other five finance clubs – Corporate Finance Investment Management Private Wealth Management Private Equity and Entrepreneurship & Venture Capital – further bolstering our finance program. She also actively advocated on the behalf of her fellow career club presidents when needed.

She established a new relationship with the Undergraduate Finance Society to help support our MBA students with less work experience and worked with Carolina Women in Business (CWIB) to increase the pipeline of female talent in the Investment Banking arena.

She is such a wonderful role model and inspiration to all students particularly career switchers and women looking to pursue investment banking. Being a business communications and French undergraduate major with no prior finance experience did not hold her back: She was a top performer in investment banking recruiting and will join Morgan Stanley post-graduation.

As club adviser I found working with Haley was a true pleasure! She was very collaborative has a strong moral compass and always stayed calm and collected during stressful times. She earned my trust very early on and has exceeded my expectations as club president.”

But it is far from being an entirely reliable indicator. In May of 2016 when Donald Trump was campaigning for President the jobs report said that payrolls had risen by just thirty-eight thousand. Trump proclaimed this news to be a “bombshell”; Reince Priebus the head of the Republican National Committee at the time said that the numbers demonstrated the failure of the Obama Administration. It turned out to be a blip. In both of the next two months more than a quarter of a million jobs were created.

In statistical terms the jobs figures are “noisy”—meaning that they tend to jump around distorting the underlying trend. On Wall Street this has long been recognized. Years ago I wrote a profile of Victor Niederhoffer a veteran speculator who made his living investing in the futures markets. Niederhoffer was an inveterate risktaker but he did take some safety precautions. Every month shortly in advance of the employment report he would close out most of his positions. The jobs bulletin was too unpredictable to take the chance of being caught out he explained. I thought of Niederhoffer on Friday morning when the Labor Department reported that the economy had created just two hundred and sixty-six thousand jobs in April.

This is what’s known as a big miss. Many Wall Street economists had predicted that the figure would be close to a million or more: Goldman Sachs had said 1.3 million; Morgan Stanley expected 1.25 million. The large undershoot prompted a vigorous debate. Echoing statements from employers that they are having difficulty finding workers to fill vacancies Republicans and business organizations called on the White House to cancel the three-hundred-dollar weekly supplement to unemployment benefits that was included in the latest pandemic-relief package. “The disappointing jobs report makes it clear that paying people not to work is dampening what should be a stronger jobs market” the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a press release. Some Democrats argued that the real problem was a lack of adequate child care which was preventing working parents from returning to the labor force. “The numbers tell the story” Senator Elizabeth Warren said in a statement. “There were 8000 fewer women working in April compared to the previous month and 64000 fell out of the labor force entirely.” Other observers pointed to a continuing fear of the coronavirus as a factor dissuading people from going back to work.

In search of guidance about what is really happening I called up one of the few economists who had warned that the April jobs report might not be as strong as expected: Gregory Daco the chief U.S. economist at the consultancy firm Oxford Economics. In a Twitter thread on Thursday the day before the numbers were released Daco pointed to a “high degree of uncertainty.” He also said that April might turn out to be a “ ‘breather’ month” for the economy before strong job growth resumed over the summer. Despite the prescience of this warning I quickly discovered that Daco wasn’t about to congratulate himself or exaggerate the significance of the payrolls number. “I think we have to be a little humble in the face of tremendous uncertainty and tremendous churn in the labor market” he told me. “One jobs report is not going to make or break the economy. Things are going to be bumpy from month to month. Over the summer we still expect the economy to experience months where jobs growth is more than a million and maybe even two million in one or two individual months.”

That’s an encouraging message and it jibes with other recent economic indicators which have been strong. According to an initial estimate from the Department of Commerce the gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 6.4 per cent in the first three months of the year. Retail sales jumped by almost ten per cent in March. Consumer confidence rose to its highest level since before the pandemic. These figures reflect a changing reality in the United States. About forty-five per cent of adults have received at least one vaccine shot; many states including New York and California are moving to ease their remaining restrictions on businesses; and the cash payments from the most recent relief package are bolstering the finances of many households. In short the economic-recovery story remains very much intact. So why did the level of hiring fall back last month?

Daco pointed to many potential factors that have been cited elsewhere including expanded unemployment benefits (some studies show that up to half of recipients are receiving benefits that are higher than their lost wages); a shortage of child care; and people’s enduring concerns about catching the virus. Because these things all influence workers’ willingness to supply labor economists refer to them as supply-side factors. But Daco also pointed to a demand-side factor that could be having an even more significant impact: caution among employers about hiring back too many people too quickly. “Think of a restaurant that is reopening” he said. “They might well hire a few workers at first and see if it is enough for the time being. If it isn’t they can readjust.” An industry-by-industry breakdown of the job figures provides some support for this theory of gradual adjustment. In March restaurants and bars added about a hundred thousand jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis. Last month they added another hundred and eighty-seven thousand. However total employment in the industry is still 2.8 million below where it was in February of 2020. Similar trends are visible in other industries including retail where employment fell by fifteen thousand in April after a gain of twenty-three thousand in March.

Looking ahead the key question is whether the slowdown in job growth represents a one-off or something more enduring. Between February and April of last year as the lockdowns began the percentage of working-age Americans who were employed or looking for work fell from 63.4 per cent to 60.2 per cent—an unprecedented decline in such a short period. Since then the labor-force-participation rate has rebounded to 61.7 per cent which means that less than half of the COVID-19 plunge has been reversed. Even as the pandemic recedes it is possible that many Americans who dropped out of the labor force in 2020 will never return. But it’s also perfectly possible that this danger is being overplayed. If infections and hospitalizations continue to decline nervousness about the virus should decline too. As more schools fully reopen child care may become less of an issue. The federal supplements to unemployment benefits are scheduled to expire in September and some Republican-run states are likely to suspend them even before then. Meanwhile many employers are eagerly looking for new hires. Labor “supply is eventually going to respond” Daco said. “If the labor market is red-hot and people see opportunity they are eventually going to jump back in.” On this basis he is predicting that the economy will create a total of eight million jobs in 2021 and that the unemployment rate will fall to 4.3 per cent by December.

Given the precarious nature of economic forecasting these predictions could be overly optimistic or else too cautious. But whatever happens Daco’s injunction not to place too much importance on a single employment report is worth remembering. What matters is the trend and in the three months since the start of February job growth has averaged five hundred and twenty-four thousand a month as the White House Council of Economic Advisers pointed out on Friday. That figure indicates that the economy is rebounding strongly from the pandemic and this time next month when the Labor Department releases the jobs report for May it is likely to show a substantial pickup in hiring as that rebound continues. But don’t bet your house on a specific figure. The U.S. economy has been surprising us at every turn since the coronavirus struck. It could do it again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtaGlyZXMtZXhpdHMtYmxhY2tzdG9uZS1ydXNzZWxsLWludmVzdG1lbnRzLXZpa2luZy1ndWdnZW5oZWltLTIwMjEtNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall Street Hires and Exits: Blackstone Russell Investments Viking,"Stephen Bruel joins Coalition Greenwich a provider of data and analytics to the financial services industry as as a senior analyst on the market structure & technology team The Trade reported this week.

On what should have been a joyous Mother’s Day for Meredith Reed her widower is grieving the loss of his wife. Matt Reed a first-time father now spends hours watching over infant son Dylan born three months before his due date.

Dylan Russell Reed weighed 2 pounds 11 ounces when he was born April 15 at Skagit Valley Hospital.

On the same day her son was delivered by C-section 42-year-old Meredith Reed died. She was stricken by a pulmonary embolism a blood clot in her lung. In an ambulance on the way to the hospital from the couple’s Mount Vernon home her heart had stopped.

“She just had this zest for life” Matt Reed said. A wildlife biologist he now spends hours each day with Dylan in the neonatal intensive care unit at the Pavilion for Women and Children part of Providence Regional Medical Center Everett.

Dylan he said is doing well. His weight was up to 2 pounds 15 ounces by Thursday. He’s in an incubator and around the clock is helped to breathe with a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure therapy) machine. He is tube-fed with donated breast milk.

Reed holds his son skin-to-skin on his chest and has learned to change the tiniest preemie diapers. From doctors and nurses he’s learned that Dylan might be home by what was his due date July 15.

Meredith Reed raised in Lake Stevens was a former teacher there at Mt. Pilchuck Elementary School. And she was a devoted mother. Her 6-year-old son Harrison Owens was excited to become a big brother.

The Reeds were newlyweds. They met online in 2018. On their first date at a Bellingham park she took him blueberries grown by her parents Karen and Ken Alvin on their woodsy Lakes Stevens property. Because of the pandemic their wedding on March 20 2020 was a small family-and-friends affair at a waterfront park in La Conner.

“Meredith loved to do everything” said Karen Alvin describing the eldest of her three children as a dynamo. Her daughter she said had traveled the world gone tandem skydiving and held numerous jobs through the years — from the Viking Drive-In in Lakes Stevens and a doctor’s office to Eagle Day Camp an Everett program for school-age kids.

For 14 years she’d also been a devotee of the Oregon Country Fair and volunteered at the annual art and music festival.

Her LinkedIn profile included a fun fact: “I make and sell my own hula hoops.” It said she had hula hooped in two Canadian provinces 15 states and on three Hawaiian islands.

She had most recently worked as a lead consultant for the Mosaic Company a firm involved with the utility industry. A co-worker Miranda Leurquin wrote glowingly about the “ultra-optimist” Reed as part of a GoFundMe online fundraiser. As of Friday afternoon $55260 had been pledged in the effort to help Matt Reed Dylan and Harrison.

“Meredith Margaret Owens Reed was a vibrant ray of light and brought joy to every life she touched” wrote Leurquin. “She loved the outdoors camping art and was passionate about teaching and lifelong learning.”

At the Alvins’ home Thursday there was no hiding the heartbreak as Matt Reed 40 and his mother-in-law shared memories of the woman they both loved.

“She liked to talk to people. I’m the quiet one” said Reed who has taken time off from Hamer Environmental a consulting firm to focus on his infant son. He’s being helped by the state’s Paid Family and Medical Leave benefit.

His wife and her former husband shared custody of Harrison who’ll now spend some of his time with Reed. On Thursday the 6-year-old and a cousin played with their grandfather Ken Alvin making robots from cardboard boxes.

Karen Alvin said if her daughter was your friend she was a friend for life. “She could be very blunt was very successful in her job but she was a child at heart” Alvin said.

Meredith attended Sunnycrest Elementary School and played volleyball at North Lake Middle School. She played flute and was on the drill team at Lake Stevens High School. Along with her husband parents and sons she is survived by a brother Will and sister Colleen.

A retired teacher Karen Alvin taught at North Lake and she taught music at Everett’s Immaculate Conception and Our Lady of Perpetual Help School.

Only Dylan’s dad and his grandmother are now allowed in the NICU to see him.

“You see a little change every day” said Alvin adding that Dylan is a “typical preemie” for a baby born at 27 weeks. In his cries she hears music. “I call it singing opera” she said.

With the death of a child Alvin has suffered a mother’s worst loss. Yet she gets up every day with reason for hope and the chance to be with her grandsons.

“Dylan he’s the miracle in all this” she said. “Meredith was there long enough to make sure he could survive.”

The mosaics at Palmers Green Station made by Alex McHallam and Tamara Froud take inspiration from the area’s parks and open spaces (credit Amanda Eatwell www.amandaeatwellphotography.com)

On Platform 1 at Palmers Green Station four mosaic panels have been installed as a celebration of the local green spaces; the parks rivers and gardens of the local area.

Designed and made by Alex McHallam and Tamara Froud the works were commissioned by Palmers Green Action Team (PGAT) and funded by Govia Thameslink Railway the parent company of Great Northern which operates the railway station.

Local knowledge really helped Alex research for material for the designs as she grew up in the area. The artists also worked on one of the panels with pupils from Broomfield School.

Alex said: “I was thrilled to be asked to create site-specific work in an area I know so well. Once I had seen the arches on the platform I knew I wanted to fill them with art.

“They are so inviting as they suggest windows or doors into another view.”

There is also a small reference to the pandemic as Alex and Tamara have included a discarded face mask with their initials on the ‘parks’ panel. She added: “There is no doubt that the project has been shaped by the pandemic and we felt we wanted to acknowledge it as well as celebrating all the area.”

Jenny Saunders customer services director for Thameslink and Great Northern said: “We owe a huge ‘thank you’ to Alex and Tamara for conceiving and creating this fabulous set of mosaics for Palmers Green and to our partners PGAT for commissioning such talented local artists.”

Bitcoin has come a long way since its inception in 2009. With bitcoin’s market capitalization at just over $1 trillion new on-chain data reveals that the number of millionaire members of the bitcoin rich list have ballooned.

But what is the “bitcoin rich list” and why should you care?

The bitcoin rich list refers to the list of bitcoin addresses that hold over $1 million worth of BTC. Since January 2021 over 100000 wallets have met the qualification. Notably the number swelled by 400% from just 25000 millionaires five months ago.

However the list is not as large as it is often portrayed to be. And it looks like the upside has a long way to go because of two simple facts.

First: There are approximately 46.8 million millionaires in the world holding at least $158.3 trillion of wealth — a number of fiat millionaires that clearly dwarfs the 100000 bitcoin millionaire wallets.

In comparison there are little more than 100000 addresses with over $1 million worth of BTC and only 9370 with over $10 million as of March 2021.

Second: The number of around 100000 accounts holding over $1 million doesn’t mean each account is owned by a unique person. Why? Of course individuals can own multiple bitcoin addresses.

After all you can use on-chain analysis to find out how many bitcoin accounts exist and how much is in each account. But you can’t see who owns those accounts.

So the actual number of bitcoin millionaires is almost certainly lower than 100000 if you assume some of these addresses are held by the same individuals.

The small number of bitcoin millionaires (just 0.2% of the 46.8 millionaires in the world) offers a perspective that we are still in the early innings with bitcoin’s adoption rate. As more millionaires diversify a percentage of their wealth from fiat to bitcoin the asset’s price can go even higher.

Another Catalyst For More Millionaires Owning Bitcoin In The Future

Banks are the key catalyst that can drive up the total net worth held in bitcoin. Namely more banks are offering institutional services for bitcoin that would allow high-net-worth clients to easily own bitcoin within their current bank accounts.

Hundreds of smaller banks have already signed on to offer regulated funds for bitcoin. As a result giants like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America could face pressure to offer bitcoin to their retail banking customers.

Bitcoin is also gaining traction in the private wealth management industry which handles trillions of dollars for high-net-worth clients.

In March Morgan Stanley a giant in wealth management with $4 trillion in client assets told its financial advisors that it is launching access to three funds that enable exposure to bitcoin. A few weeks later Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan followed with their own statements about launching bitcoin services for their private clients.

Moreover U.S. Bank which is part of U.S. Bancorp the fifth-largest bank in the United States announced it would offer a cryptocurrency custody product with the engagement of a sub-custodian for fund servicing.

Bottom line: With a growing number of banks making it easier for high-net-worth individuals to buy and sell bitcoin the number of their private client millionaires investing in bitcoin could skyrocket in the future. Bitcoin’s price may follow as well.

This becomes clear from a set of documents filed with the Illinois Northern District Court on May 7 2021.

This is a non-solicit and misappropriation of trade secrets case. Jeffrey French was a broker for GAA which was acquired by StoneX Group. GAA is an Illinois limited liability company with a headquarters in Chicago. It is a financial services firm specializing in commodity trading execution and management services. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of GAIN Capital Holdings Inc which in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of StoneX. StoneX Group is a successor in interest to GAA.

Mr French was hired to serve GAA clients and entrusted with GAA resources and confidential information. He signed an agreement that prohibits him from soliciting GAA’s customers for two years after his employment ends.

On January 29 2021 Mr French voluntarily ended his broker relationship with GAA and thereafter GAA assigned new brokers to the accounts he previously serviced.

According to StoneX before leaving Mr French compiled GAA’s trade secrets such as customer lists trading habits and pricing information. And on information and belief he is making active use of the information to solicit GAA’s customers for his own benefit.

Mr French is alleged to have clandestinely contacted GAA’s customers using GAA’s trade secrets—customer specific information such as customer lists trading habits and profits and margins data—in order to solicit them for his new business Ag Hedger. After gathering all of the GAA information he needed establishing a new entity through which to compete and lining up a guarantee from another entity he resigned from GAA.

On investigation StoneX further learned of Mr French’s contacts with those customers while still working for GAA and that French set up Ag Hedger and was at least planning to solicit clients for over six months.

In this lawsuit StoneX seeks that the Court enforce Mr French’s non-solicitation obligations prevent the further misappropriation of GAA’s trade secrets and prevent the irreparable harm that follows from such violations.

Details of the settlement between the parties are not clear at this point. The parties have said the agreement is confidential. What FX News Group knows is that a key term (and condition) of the settlement is the entry by the Court of a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from violating the terms of Jeffrey French’s restrictive covenants at issue.

Thereafter the parties will jointly move for the dismissal of the litigation pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2).",,,,,,

Sarandos informed the HFPA that he wasn’t satisfied with its plans to overhaul the organization following weeks of criticism for its lack of diversity among members.

“We have always valued our relationship with Netflix as we seek to bring news about motion pictures and television to the world. We hear your concerns about the changes our association needs to make and want to assure you that we are working diligently on all of them” HFPA President Ali Sar wrote in a letter to Sarandos late Friday night.

Sar wrote he wished to “clarify some misinformation” with Sarandos. “We would love to meet with you and your team so we can review the very specific actions that are already in the works” Sar wrote. “An open dialogue would help to ensure that we are addressing these concerns as quickly as possible.”

It was revealed on Friday that Sarandos sent a letter to the HFPA on Thursday after members voted to approve the board’s proposal to overhaul the group. “We don’t believe these proposed new policies — particularly around the size and speed of membership growth — will tackle the HFPA’s systemic diversity and inclusion challenges or the lack of clear standards for how your members should operate” Sarandos wrote. “So we’re stopping any activities with your organization until more meaningful changes are made. Netflix and many of the talent and creators we work with cannot ignore the HFPA’s collective failure to address these crucial issues with urgency and rigor.”

Popular on Variety

The HFPA’s plans have also been criticized by a collective of more than 100 publicity firms Time’s Up and GLAAD. NBC which broadcasts the Globes and telecast producer Dick Clark Productions praised the HFPA’s reform plans to bring greater diversity and transparency to the embattled group.

Read Sar’s letter to Sarandos below.

Dear Ted:

We have always valued our relationship with Netflix as we seek to bring news about motion pictures and television to the world. We hear your concerns about the changes our association needs to make and want to assure you that we are working diligently on all of them. We can assure you that our plan reflects input from our supporters and critics alike and we truly believe that our plan will drive meaningful reform and inclusion within our Association and in a way that the entire industry can be proud of. We are proud that our plan was overwhelmingly approved by more than 90 percent of the membership—there is no question the membership is embracing this opportunity.

We would love to meet with you and your team so we can review the very specific actions that are already in the works. An open dialogue would help to ensure that we are addressing these concerns as quickly as possible.

Also we wanted to take the opportunity below to address several issues that you raised and to clarify some misinformation.

Ali

Diversity and inclusion is at the core of our reform plan and is one of our foundational pillars. We have committed to bringing on a new DEI consultant immediately as well as a Chief Diversity Officer to ensure that these issues permanently remain at the heart of our organization. We also are committing to a significant DEI training program for our members and staff.

In our plan we committed to at a minimum 50% growth in 18 months not 36 months and to reevaluating the size of our membership after the first 18 months as we grow our staff and can accommodate more members. We have also committed to expanding our professional staff.

Our plan includes the establishment of an independent review board to help guide the implementation of our reform plan.

Per our plan our current members will have to comply with any and all new eligibility criteria just like our new members.

Press conferences are not mandatory for nominations and indeed many nominated shows have never had press conferences.

As our plan states we are immediately evaluating our code of conduct and that revised code will address the press conference concerns you cite. The new code of conduct also will enhance our campaign protocols following strict ethical standards and best practices.

We also are committed to meeting with the personal publicists to understand and address their concerns about the scheduling and conduct of HFPA screenings and press conferences and to ensure that these concerns are incorporated into our new code of conduct.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYmFycnljb2xsaW5zLzIwMjEvMDUvMDgvdGhlLW5ldGZsaXgtc3BlZWQtcHJvYmxlbS15b3UtZG9udC1ldmVuLWtub3cteW91LWhhdmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Netflix Speed Problem You Don't Even Know You Have,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2021/05/08/the-netflix-speed-problem-you-dont-even-know-you-have/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYmFycnljb2xsaW5zLzIwMjEvMDUvMDgvdGhlLW5ldGZsaXgtc3BlZWQtcHJvYmxlbS15b3UtZG9udC1ldmVuLWtub3cteW91LWhhdmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdG9wLXNob3dzLW5ldGZsaXgtdGhpcy13ZWVrLXNoYWRvdy1ib25lLXNvbnMtb2Ytc2FtLTIwMjEtNdIBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdG9wLXNob3dzLW5ldGZsaXgtdGhpcy13ZWVrLXNoYWRvdy1ib25lLXNvbnMtb2Ytc2FtLTIwMjEtNT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top shows on Netflix this week: 'Shadow and Bone' 'Yasuke',"9.

Srinivasan: At Netflix we have microservices using different kinds of databases based on the capabilities of each database. When a new movie is added we have the information written to a Cassandra database which would then be required by the UI but needs to be accessed with Elasticsearch or we might need this information for analytics and we will need to use a database like Iceberg which is a data warehouse solution. We'll focus on the challenges involved in keeping the data synced from Cassandra which is a distributed NoSQL database to other databases using Change Data Capture.

I'm Raghu. I'm a software engineer at Netflix working on our data integrations platform.

Databases

The data sync problem which we saw just now is not specific to Netflix. Applications end up requiring varying kinds of access patterns for the use cases they support. Due to this we have different databases with trade-offs resulting from their architectures. What are some of the access patterns? For example you could use Apache Cassandra which is known for having high availability and high write throughput workloads because it uses memtables and commit logs while providing eventual consistency but doesn't provide APIs for search. For that you could use Elasticsearch which can provide those query patterns but cannot handle analytical queries and we would need a data warehouse solution like Hive or Iceberg.

Solutions

What are some solutions to these problems? We could have the writes go to multiple databases for every write or perform every write as a distributed transaction. With dual writes some issues will be with regarding to reconciling only one of the writes succeed. Distributed transactions need management outside of the database and that is a hard problem to tackle. We could have a separate process which takes care of just extracting the data from the source optionally transforming it and then loading it into a sync database. These processes would need to have verifiers to make sure that there are no bugs in the systems and that the source and sync database always have the same information.

What Is CDC?

Where can CDC come into the picture with this? We can look at this as a solution for this problem and we'll see how that is the case. For a particular database you could be writing to it from a shell client or from an application. The changes to a database could be coming in from different systems. We're mainly concerned about inserts updates and deletes which we'll term as mutations.

Stream of Mutations

When we convert these changes at a database to a stream of events we have Change Data Capture or CDC. CDC involves capturing data which gets written to a database and sending it to downstream consumers as a stream of events. Why would we need this? Let's take a look at the previous example. Here we have an application which has a backend service with a UI. The backend service has business logic and maintains state in a robust database like Cassandra. The UI needs a more flexible database like Elasticsearch to perform text search and have search indices based on different fields to support user requests. We can solve the data sync problem between these two databases using CDC. Here we see another example where we need the data in Cassandra and an analytics oriented data warehouse solution like Iceberg or Hive. By having a Change Data Capture stream from Cassandra being written into the data warehouse solution we simplify the problem.

Let's look at how CDC operates within Cassandra. Cassandra provides high availability guarantees by having three copies of data on different nodes in a cluster. Since writes to memtables and commit logs are extremely fast we can have good performance by the database despite the replication. What are the challenges in such a system? The data is partitioned so multiple nodes have to emit the change stream. Data is replicated which means the same change will be emitted by multiple nodes. The system is active-active which is to say that there is no single authoritative node to get the change stream unlike databases like MySQL or Postgres. When multiple replicas are emitting this change stream there is no ordering guarantee in the resultant stream. The stream is also unfiltered which is to say that all changes happening in the cluster are part of the stream irrespective of which column family they might belong to or what the columns would be which you're changing. Cassandra also only provides partial changes which is to say that updates and deletes contain only affected columns and keys but not details about the full impact. A change stream with these properties ends up requiring downstream systems which consume this to make sure that they are deduplicated and have ordering somehow and filter them according to their requirements. This is an issue with the open source Debezium Cassandra connector also. We'll see how we can address these problems.

Change Stream Properties

What are the ideal properties of a change stream? You will mainly want it to be unique so there are no duplicate changes. Ordered. The changes that are emitted they are emitted in the order that they got committed in the source database. They have full row images. All columns including pre and post images of a row are emitted in the stream. It should be filtered so that there is a change stream per database per table and specific columns might need to be filtered out for security requirements where the columns could contain personally identifiable information which should not be leaving the boundaries of the database cluster.

Possible Solutions

What are some possible solutions which we can look at for this particular problem? The Cassandra clusters at Netflix have incremental backups where SSTables from the cluster are written to S3 at regular intervals. The backup system is robust but this approach could take minutes to hours to emit changes. It's not near real-time which is one of our requirements. We could use audit loggers or full query loggers which would end up severely degrading the cluster performance and require changes to Cassandra. We also need to recreate ordering outside of Cassandra. We could perform CDC in the coordinator only but this has issues with having availability and continuation of the change stream when the coordinator goes down and there's a newly elected node which becomes the coordinator. CDC could be performed in an additional copy where basically we are saying if the replication factor is three we have a fourth copy which would be in the asynchronous write path and not on the read path for the Cassandra cluster. This would make sure that this change stream has all of the previous properties which we want but the complexity of this implementation would require major changes into Cassandra.

Solution - System Design

Our solution entails instead an intermediate system which is used to hold information about the data so that we can solve these challenges. Our solution also improves upon the solution for this which is developed by Yelp where they talk about streaming Cassandra into Kafka. Here we can see what the internal architecture of our connector would look like. The mutations are read from the commit log of Cassandra and written to a Kafka topic. It's important to note that the Flink application and the Cassandra cluster need to have the same versions of the Cassandra storage engine to be able to read objects correctly since we make use of this to generate the correct full row image. We will see how we can use a KeyValueStore within Flink to store data and make sure that the Cassandra output which is unordered has duplicates has only partial updates and is unfiltered can be converted to one which is ordered dedupe created has full row images and is filtered.

System Properties

What are some of the properties of the system which make it ideal for us? The output of the Cassandra cluster ends up being a Kafka topic with n partitions. We then have workers which process events on each partition. Having this intermediary Kafka topic decouples the availability of the consuming system. This also ensures that the CDC solution has minimal impact on the Cassandra clusters performance. We have a linearizable datastore to retrieve the most recent information which is stored for a particular partition key if present. Apply the incoming change and write that back into the datastore. This helps us achieve the same ordering which is given by Cassandra for its clients. We can also scale the system independently from the Cassandra cluster to account for changes in the stream rate. We would like it if this stream could be open sourced easily also.

Apache Flink

Apache Flink is a streaming system which acts as a data plane in our solution. The major components here include the input Kafka topic the Flink application which reads from this. The application itself maintains state which in our case is RocksDB which is an ephemeral in-memory datastore. We can process incoming data from the Kafka input and emit it to an output stream here. The Flink application is able to process the stream of data and recover from failures by having the stored application state and Kafka offsets checkpointed at regular intervals. We can also scale this Flink application independently of the Cassandra cluster. We will see how this intermediary state is leveraged to provide a CDC solution for Cassandra.

Example - Create

Let's look at this with an example. Let us say there is a new movie being written into the database with a movie ID 842 for Fargo and the status is private. The sidecar would read this mutation and write it to the CDC Kafka topic. This would then end up being read by the Flink application and written into the RocksDB store with the partition key and the mutation information. As this is a fresh show it would have all of the information for that particular row. The second Kafka topic then gets a record for that row with a Create operation. As you can see here we maintain a fourth copy of the data outside of Cassandra. Let's see why this would be required.

Update

Let's update that row to have different information in the columns. We want to change the status of Fargo from private to public. When we make that update in Cassandra the sidecar emits that change to the CDC Kafka topic. It is important to note that the change in the Kafka topic only has to change columns but not all of the row information. Specifically we are missing the information that Fargo is part of the store. When this is sent to the Flink application we have the previous mutation which came for this particular partition key and we can reconcile that with the incoming event and make sure that we have a full row image generated in this datastore. This is then emitted as an update for that particular row into the Source Connector Kafka.

Delete

Let's look at how a delete would happen. If we end up deleting that same row from Cassandra we store a delete for that particular partition key in Cassandra as a tombstone. Cassandra would end up removing this tombstone after GC 3 seconds. The sidecar would serialize this mutation and we would store that particular delete within the datastore here and emit the delete information to the Source Connector Kafka. We also at the same time store a timer within Flink state to make sure that we remove this partition key from the map if there are no future updates which come for this particular partition key with a higher timestamp. This way we can make sure that the data grows and shrinks correctly according to whatever is happening on Cassandra.

Unique and Ordered

How do we make sure we can guarantee uniqueness and ordering in our output stream? Unique mutations in the Source Connector Kafka stream can be achieved by checking that we have already processed this particular information from a previous replica. When the second replica ends up emitting this same information we do not send the row update to the Source Connector Kafka. Ordering is guaranteed by making the CDC Kafka topic a key topic where the key is the partition key of the change. This way all changes for a particular partition key arrive at the same consumer in Flink. Because we have the same storage engine we can recreate order for these changes correctly. There is a cost to be paid for the ordering we would need to deserialize the mutation to know which partition key to use and serialize it back before writing it to the CDC Kafka topic.

Schema Changes

What happens when the schema for column family changes? The Cassandra storage engine in Flink needs to have the right schema information in order to deserialize the mutation correctly. For this we listen for schema changes by registering with the Cassandra cluster to make sure we have this up to date information.

Filtering

How do we make sure we have filtering of the output Change Data Capture stream? This is required because the original CDC stream from Cassandra will have changes from all of the column families or tables for that particular cluster. We would normally want this as separate streams and with specific fields. We can perform this filtering at the Flink application and generate messages to multiple Kafka topics one per column family.

Challenges

What are some challenges with this solution? We obviously need to keep an additional copy of the data so if your replication factor is already three for Cassandra resiliency then you have four copies. This added cost is on both infrastructure and maintenance. What happens when the write throughput on Cassandra is higher than what Kafka can safely handle? We could drop the stream to keep Cassandra available. This would mean we need to backfill from SSTables at scale. We would also need to make sure that the Flink system and Cassandra cluster which is emitting changes are the same version of the storage engine which is also an operational overhead.

Next Steps

Here we have seen how we can get an eventually consistent change stream from an active-active setup database like Cassandra. We have a stream which is unique ordered full rows and filtered. Our solution could be extended to support other databases which have architectures similar to Cassandra where CDC is not supported out of the box. There are still a lot of questions left with some solutions in the horizon. For example how can we make sure we have a schema attached to the output stream and make schema evolution possible? How do we scale this to handle data at the scale at which Netflix systems operate? How does this operate in prod? What are some operational challenges for managing this infrastructure at scale? Stay tuned for answers to all these questions and more in a future blog post.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXJ0b29uYnJldy5jb20vc3RyZWFtaW5nL3RoZS1taXRjaGVsbHMtdnMtdGhlLW1hY2hpbmVzLWhhcy1iZWVuLW5ldGZsaXhzLXRvcC11LXMtZmlsbS1mb3ItOS1kYXlzLWluLWEtcm93LTIwNTAyMS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The Mitchells Vs. The Machines' Has Been Netflix's Top U.S. Film For 9 Days In A Row,"In this new age of streaming premieres where box office is no longer measurable and audience data is proprietary to the streamers it can be difficult to gauge how a film is performing. But there’s at least one film that we know has been successful: Sony Pictures Animation’s The Mitchells vs. The Machines.

On Sunday the Mike Rianda-directed film which bypassed theaters for a straight-to-Netflix drop on April 30 notched its ninth straight day as the top Netflix film in the United States.

Mitchells has also been Netflix’s top movie globally for six days in a row. The current animation record-holder for longest-streak at no. 1 is The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run which held the top spot on Netflix for 12 days. (All chart data is via FlixPatrol.com.)

The Sony film’s performance is notable when compared to Netflix’s own original animated features. Among Netflix’s original releases – The Willoughbys Over the Moon and Arlo the Alligator Boy – only The Willoughbys has recorded multiple days at no. 1 with two days atop the streamer’s Top 10. The rankings for the company’s other original feature Klaus isn’t known since Netflix hadn’t yet introduced its most-viewed ranking when the holiday film was released back in 2019.

Mitchells continues a curious trend on Netflix in which films licensed from legacy studios have outperformed its homegrown efforts at least in its publicly available Top 10 rankings. Outside of The Willoughbys the animated features that have performed best on Netflix have been licensed titles such as Despicable Me The Angry Birds Movie 2 The Secret Life of Pets 2 and The Grinch. It’ll be interesting to see whether this changes after Netflix begins releasing a greater number of its own original features.

Another important question to ask: What do these rankings even mean? Netflix doesn’t offer any insight into how these rankings translate to audience numbers nor do we have any clearer understanding of how Netflix’s releases have performed against films that are launching on competing services like HBO Max Disney+ and so on. The Top 10 is useful to some extent but it’s also difficult to not view it as a fatuous bit of self-promotion for the company. In my view the most valuable insight we can glean from the strong performance of The Mitchells vs. The Machines is that an animated film has outperformed all of Netflix’s live-action feature product for over a week.

The Foxtel insight came as Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp announced a move into the black for the March quarter with a $US96 million ($123.55 million) profit compared to a $US1 billion loss for the same time last year.

Overall revenues in the Foxtel subscription video business were up 13 per cent or $US61 million to $US523 million. But $14 million of that came from foreign exchange fluctuations meaning that real business revenues actually rose only 10 per cent to $US509 million.

Subscribers to the traditional pay-TV offer fell 6 per cent to 1.94 million while newcomer Binge gained 526000 subscribers from its standing start last May. The sports streaming service Kayo more than doubled its viewership to 851000 pay customers.

While growth in those new options is good news “subscriber churn was 20 per cent” said independent media analyst Peter Cox.

“Back in the good old days it was 12 per cent and a year ago it was 17.5 per cent. That churn is being driven by people switching from being broadcast [pay-TV] subscribers at $80 a month to being streaming subscribers at much lower rates” Mr Cox said.

The company’s subscription rates show the difference starkly. Foxtel pay-TV subscriptions range between $49 and $104 a month and its original streaming service Foxtel Now costs between $25 and $109 a month.

Binge a Netflix and Stan competitor costs between $10 and $18 and the sports-focused Kayo between $25 and $35. The subscription figures show clearly that viewers continue to desert the traditional medium.

But the new streaming services are also eating Foxtel Now’s lunch.

It lost 29 per cent of its subscribers with many of them likely going to the cheaper offers internally.

The streaming future for Foxtel will depend on winning large numbers of new subscribers to defray the erosion of its higher-margin traditional business.

To date that hasn’t been happening as is evidenced by the low rise in subscription-TV revenues once the foreign exchange gain is removed.

And given the highly competitive Australian streaming scene that will be a tough call with Netflix well ensconced Stan growing strongly and big hitters like Amazon and Apple now in the market.

Kayo’s numbers have been strong and it has benefited from $US22 million in cost cuts it managed to wring from Australian football codes. But it is still in a difficult situation.

“It is all very well having a low subscription [cost] but it is not earning what it costs them to buy sport” Mr Cox said.

“If they truly accounted for it [sports costs] directly it would show a big loss.”

Print sliding

News Corp’s results also highlighted the continuing decline in print media revenues. When the sale of US business News America Marketing is taken out the News Media operation which includes US and UK papers it leaves revenue growth of only 2 per cent and a 67 per cent decline in pre-tax earnings to $US8 million.

While newspapers are trying to switch to a subscription-based online model to boost revenues this is not going well at significant parts of News. While Australian subscriptions grew by 24 per cent to 760000 they fell by significant levels at the New York Post and were flat or lower at UK papers.

The continued collapse of print revenues is clearly visible in the Australian market according to Chris Walton principal at media buyers Nunn Media.

“If you look at the nine months of the financial year to the end of March advertising revenues for all media were $5.5 billion” Mr Walton said.

“TV revenues were flat at $2.2 billion digital advertising [on media and other web sites] grew 10 per cent to $2 billion while newspaper advertising fell 24 per cent to $174 million and magazines collapsed 47 per cent to only $37 million.

“That means print-ad revenues are only 3.8 per cent of all media ad revenues. The often mentioned decline of print shows no sign of abating.”

The pride of the News Corp print stable Dow Jones which owns The Wall Street Journal showed revenue growth of $US24 million or 6 per cent. But foreign exchange gains again accounted for $US4 million of that.

Australian market rebounding

The Australian television advertising market is beginning to bounce back from lows caused by the coronavirus.

Standard Media Index Australian managing director Jane Ratcliffe said “figures in March were up 2 per cent but from what we can see in April it was up 20 per cent and it’s going to be up lots more.”

The sneaker in question is Nike's first-ever hands-free sneaker which thanks to resellers is no longer affordable for the people who need it most.

The Nike GO Flyease was released in February becoming the Swoosh's first truly accessible sneaker. Through a tensioner essentially a giant rubber band above the midsole the shoe is able to snap on and off the wearer’s foot without them having to bend over tie laces or otherwise adjust the sneaker with their hands.

The hands-free shoe was designed to make life easier for people with disabilities — a demographic that is too often underrepresented in the sneaker industry.

To make matters worse the sneaker innovation was released with an affordable $120 price tag. Yet if you're in the market to buy a pair of Nike GO Flyeases now get ready to pay upwards of $600.

A viral TikTok video by Louie ""notlewy"" highlights just how revolting these price hikes are. ""The shoe itself has been so hyped up and praised for its inclusiveness and its accessibility for people like myself with a disability that it became limited and resellers and bots have got a hold of all the pairs and gouged the price up"" he says in the clip.

However resellers aren’t the only ones at fault for the situation we find ourselves in. Resellers after all only act on supply and demand and judging by the sneaker’s resell prices supply was very limited.

As Nike so often does with new models the hands-free shoe was initially dropped in a limited run with a wider release to follow down the line. This was catnip to resellers’ feline instincts as they snatched up the shoe and quickly listed it for nearly six times the retail price.

That prompted some to question why Nike would release a limited supply of what is supposed to be an accessible shoe? Wasn’t the whole point of the GO Flyease to give people who were previously excluded or disadvantaged easier access to sneakers? Was this all performative activism?

There’s definitely some blame to lay at the feet of Nike even if you don’t think that the release was used primarily as a marketing tool. The fact is that people who want the shoe because they need the shoe can’t currently get it.

On the flip side though Nike has promised a wider release of the silhouette so maybe everyone who wants a pair will eventually get one. Additionally one could argue that the first truly accessible sneaker being so hyped and successful sends a message to Nike and all of its sportswear competitors that there’s a demand for accessible and inclusive sneakers. If brands are smart they’ll look to satisfy that demand sooner rather than later.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJhZS5jb20vMjAyMS81L25pa2UtYWlyLWpvcmRhbi0xLWFqMS1hcmN0aWMtb3JhbmdlLXBlYWNoLWJsYWNrLWNvbG9yd2F5LXByaWNlLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Nike Debuts Air Jordan 1 Low in ""Arctic Orange""","Nike Dresses the Air Jordan 1 Low in Shades of Peach and Black Arriving in a similar color blocking style to the 2019 AJ 1 “Crimson Tint.”

The campaign will drop multiple chapters of inspiring content and experiences coming throughout the rest of the year.

Nike believes that sport can inspire create community and provide a platform for positive change. And sport does not have to be only about winning and competition it can be about the joy of movement and the creativity of play. It’s time to Play New.

The campaign launches with an anthem film “Play New.” The 60-second video features elite athletes Sabrina Ionescu Dina Asher-Smith and Blake Leeper and the award-winning singer and dancer Rosalía. Together they join everyday athletes in having fun trying new sports.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUvEEVq4woU

In addition to the hero film Nike will share a series of Play New stories featuring athletes and other protagonists on Nike’s digital ecosystem and social channels. These stories will highlight how sport has changed these athletes and then how they have changed the world around them. Dina Asher-Smith will share the impact sport had on her as a young runner as a female athlete and now as a role model for girls and young women. Sabrina Ionescu will talk about how her childhood game gave her the grit she has today and why she’s determined to inspire the next generation of basketball players.

“Play means joy. It represents pure enjoyment and being able to just be free. All kids play. That’s just a natural thing they do. The reason we are encouraging people to ‘Play New’ is to celebrate that notion of getting back to the joy of discovering and trying something for the first time — the joy of letting loose a little bit.” – Melanie Auguste VP Global Brand Marketing

Nike will also seek to engage people to join in sport through its social channels as well creating new ways of accessing sport through Snapchat and TikTok.

On Snapchat Nike will introduce new Play New-themed full-body augmented reality Lenses to encourage people to enter a virtual world and try something new like surfing boxing dancing or yoga. The AR Lenses will contain persistent storage – a new feature from Snapchat – so users can return to the Lens to see their scores and progress.

On TikTok Nike will create a series of episodic journeys that follow TikTok creators as they try something new sharing their funny and imperfect experiences with audiences. This will join Nike’s existing “Break It Down” content series featuring creators teaching their signature moves to encourage youth to have fun and get moving.

I don’t know about you but I think it is about time I tried something new too.

The age-old problem of completely stopped trains blocking major city thoroughfares is rearing its head again however.

Muncie's Deputy Mayor Richard Ivy has said this issue has become almost a daily inquiry to the city administration. The city has received over 50 complaints from numerous stakeholders in Muncie just at the start of the year.

""Angry people people saying it's not good city workers as well as fire and police"" Ivy said.

Issues are arising on many of the busiest roads through the city all of which are affected by east to west railroad lines. These include crossings crossings on McGalliard Road Tillotson Avenue Batavia Avenue Walnut Street and more that crisscross the city.

A network of trains causes headaches for drivers

When last reported in 2017 CSX Transportation said it moves around 20 trains and Norfolk Southern said it moves 25 trains through Muncie every day on a variety of tracks.

Those who try to avoid trains have to take the Madison Street underpass when trains block areas near downtown. Other routes can be used but you have to know the city streets well enough to know where the next unblocked crossing might be.

Even for lifelong residents that's not always easy.

Star Press archives:Frustrations mount over stopped trains but answers are few

Ivy said those not familiar with the city's roads especially truck drivers are left waiting at trains that sit at intersections. In 2019 The Star Press talked with residents who would wait at blocked intersections for upwards of an hour.

Not only are blocked intersections becoming an issue but Ivy said that residents are reporting the rail company is no longer following the quiet zone ordinance around the Washington Street area.

A few years ago when the hotel downtown was built city officials worked with the railroad companies in 2015 to implement a quiet zone.

That project cost roughly $5 million and closed several crossings to limit the amount of roads actually crossing the tracks. It should have eliminated a lot of the horn noise in the downtown area but the effort has been criticized ever since it took place because residents say train horns can still be heard.

More:Despite signs railroad company says no train increase

While stopped trains are a problem for commuters one of the biggest issues may be that trains can cause havoc for emergency service vehicles in some situations.

Paul Singleton director of the Delaware County 911 Emergency Operations Center said that trains stopped at intersections have become more of an issue lately.

It's something that's always concerning for dispatch as they try getting emergency services to people in the fastest possible manner.

“There has been an increase that we’ve noticed and I’ve noticed it personally too” Singleton said. “We make sure that first responders are aware that there is a train blocked.”

Singleton said that fortunately emergency services from police fire and EMS are on all sides of the tracks. It's a rarity that they have delays for emergency services but it does happen. The Star Press has reported several times when first responders were having to navigate around a stopped train on Tillotson Avenue to respond to emergencies.

“There is usually someone available where we might have an emergency” Singleton said.

Railroad oversight doesn't fall to local officials

Trains have been a problem examined by nearly every city administration since well before former mayor Dan Canon.

So what can be done?

Oversight of the rail lines falls to the federal government meaning there is little that even state officials can do to help with the situation. The deputy mayor through even more research has basically been told that there nothing the municipality can do on their own to regulate trains that cross the city.

""Our roads run across their train tracks not the other way around"" Ivy said.

In 2018 the Indiana Supreme Court struck down a state law that allowed municipalities to fine railroads when stopped trains blocked a street for longer than 10 minutes. The move was heavily criticized by former Muncie Mayor Dennis Tyler who faced mounting problems with stalled trains.

There just really isn't any power that city officials have to fix the issue. That said officials are hoping opening a dialogue again with the rail companies may help things improve.

""I'm open to anything that resolves it"" Ivy said. ""I don't know why Muncie has become so bad with this lately.”

Ivy said that the administration is supposed to have a meeting with Norfolk Southern in the coming week.

What do the rail companies have to say about the issue?

“Stopped trains especially at a crossing are a concern for Norfolk Southern across our entire network” Jeff DeGraff a representative with Norfolk Southern said. “We work hard to provide quality efficient service to our customers that are moving the freight that drives the economy and at the same time acknowledge the needs of the community.”

DeGraff said that trains like those in Muncie may be stopped for several reasons including mechanical issues congestion on tracks further ahead or it may be waiting for a train to pass in the opposite direction.

“Regardless we try to minimize the amount of time they are stopped while keeping the safety of our crew in mind” DeGraff added.

DeGraff said that if issues arise from multiple or repeated events they communicate and work with local officials to address the problems.

“As such we are meeting with city officials next week and look forward to discussing how we can minimize impacts to residents of the area” DeGraff said.

So what to do if your intersection remains blocked longer than 10 minutes? These are the phone numbers you might want in that sort of situation:

First off do not call 911. A blocked railroad crossing is not an emergency.

However you can call 765-747-4838 (the city non-emergency dispatch number) or 765-747-7878 (the county non-emergency dispatch number) to notify local authorities so that there can be a start to the communication between local dispatchers and railroad dispatchers. The following numbers may also be useful:

INDOT railroad services at 317-232-1491

INDOT customer service at 1-866-849-1368

Call the railroad company directly using the 1-800 number posted at the crossing (if you can see it of course)

CSX emergency number is 1-800-232-0144; CSX Transportation office is 904-359-3100

Norfolk Southern police at 800-946-4744

Steve Aiken’s move comes 10 days after the Democratic Unionist party leader Arlene Foster was forced to quit after an internal heave against her.

The announcement from the South Antrim MLA who will remain as leader until a successor is chosen was also prompted by mounting discontent within the party over his stewardship.

With Aiken’s decision coming so soon after Foster’s unionism is set for a significant realignment ahead of next year’s Assembly election.

The broader unionist and loyalist community in Northern Ireland has been significantly unsettled by the emergence of Brexit’s Irish Sea border and their political representatives acknowledge the election could be pivotal for the pro-union cause.

And if the political turmoil ends up destabilising the power-sharing administration in Belfast the election could come sooner than scheduled.

Aiken a former submarine captain was elected UUP leader unopposed in 2019. Many are tipping the Upper Bann MLA Doug Beattie as a likely successor.

He was viewed as a serious leadership contender back in 2019 when the last vacancy arose but he ultimately chose not to stand leaving Aiken with a clear path to the job.

In a letter to the party chair Danny Kennedy Aiken said he believed he had taken the party as far as he could. “To achieve our goals we now need new leadership” he wrote.

Aiken said he would remain in politics and continue as a South Antrim MLA.

Discussing his time as leader Aiken said he took pride in the party’s decision to take on the challenging health minister portfolio when Stormont was restored in 2020.

He said his party colleague and former leader Robin Swann had been successful in his efforts to tackle the pandemic.

“However despite our successes it has become clear to me that if we are to achieve the breakthrough in the forthcoming Assembly elections we will need to drive further ahead” Aiken wrote.

“To represent the brand of unionism that builds on hope and not fear and provides a clear modern alternative that will be both the future of our party and Northern Ireland will require strong leadership.”

He said unionism needed positive hopeful and progressive leadership.

“The last few months have been a momentous time for our Union and for Northern Ireland” he wrote.

“It is also a time when unionism more than ever needs positive hopeful and progressive leadership; leadership which I strongly believe only the Ulster Unionist party can provide.

“Our party has delivered for the people of Northern Ireland for many years and in the centenary of Northern Ireland continues to do what is right – not just for unionists but for everyone.”

In a written reply to Aiken Kennedy said he “regretfully” acknowledged his decision to resign.

“On behalf of the officers and the entire party I want to express my deep appreciation for the service you have rendered as leader and pay tribute to your unstinting efforts to promote our raison d’etre – the maintenance and preservation of Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom” he wrote.

Beattie was among those paying tribute to the party leader. “The loneliness of leadership is never easy” he tweeted. “The cruel comments are a measure of those unwilling to put their heads above the parapet.

“As my party leader my colleague and my friend I want to thank Steve for his for service past present and in the future.”

Swann tweeted: “I want to thank @SteveAikenUUP for his leadership it is oft time both a rewarding and challenging position to hold.

“But most of all I thank him for his support and the trust he placed in me when he nominated me as health minister.”",,,,,,,,,

The work took place at the service’s flight test facility at Patuxent River Maryland according to the US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). The first live firing of the AARGM-ER is expected “this spring”.

The test demonstrated the weapon’s ability to communicate with the aircraft as well as compatibility.

“Data collected from this testing will support expansion of flight testing with AARGM-ER to the full performance envelope of F/A-18 Super Hornet” says Captain Mitch Commerford programme manager for the Direct and Time Sensitive Strike programme office (PMA-242). “This flight represents a significant step in the AARGM-ER engineering and manufacturing development phase.”

The AARGM-ER is an evolution of the AARGM weapon that will integrated with the F/A-18E/F EA-18G Growler and the Lockheed Martin F-35.

AARGM is designed to engage enemy radars. The AARGM-ER features a new rocket motor and warhead that NAVAIR says will “provide advanced capability to detect and engage enemy air defence systems”.

NAVAIR however has not disclosed the ranges of either AARGM or AARGM-ER.

In November 2020 NAVAIR said it would award Northrop a sole-source contract to start manufacturing the weapon. The AARGM-ER had passed its critical design review in June 2020.

Northrop offers this description of the system: “AARGM is the most advanced system for pilots against today’s modern surface-to-air threats. It is able to rapidly engage land- and sea-based air-defence threats as well as striking time-sensitive targets.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyYW5kZm9ya3NoZXJhbGQuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2dyYW5kLWZvcmtzLWVhc3QtZ3JhbmQtZm9ya3MtY2hhbWJlcnMtc2hhcmstdGFuay1ldmVudC1icmluZy1mdW4taWRlYXMtYW5kLXByaXplc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grand Forks/East Grand Forks Chamber's Shark Tank event bring fun ideas and prizes,"After having taken a hiatus in 2020 because of the pandemic the East Grand Forks/Grand Forks Chamber hosted its annual Shark Tank event at the Empire Arts Center on Wednesday May 5.

The evening brought out a group of people who were brave enough to give a fast pitch to a panel of four local “sharks” long-time business owners in the community who followed up with questions and feedback. For Barry Wilfahrt the Chamber’s president it’s the continuation of a fun idea meant to encourage people to start their own businesses that dates back to 2015.

“It's really about innovation and entrepreneurship” Wilfahrt said. “It's really to encourage people to think of new products new ways of doing things.”

The program got off the ground six years ago when Wilfahrt was watching Shark Tank on TV with his wife Kristi who thought of holding a local version of the event. Wilfahrt took the idea to the Chamber and has been an annual event ever since.

“We were watching the show one time and she said ‘you know you guys are always promoting starting new businesses and entrepreneurship and innovation. Why doesn't the Chamber hold the Shark Tank that'd be kind of fun’” Wilfahrt said.

The show which debuted in 2009 pits entrepreneurs against a panel of billionaire investors with whom they seek to make a deal. In Grand Forks contestants many of them beyond the idea phase with early stage startup businesses don’t make deals with the sharks. They simply pitch their idea answer a few questions and get some honest feedback.

More than 60 people attended Wednesday’s event to watch 10 entrepreneurs walk on stage under a spotlight and to the same cheesy walk-up music from the television program. Contestants pitched ideas ranging from an audit service of maintenance records for private aircraft to an open late daycare for parents working late shifts to a girls hassle-free vacation service.

This year’s panel of sharks included Matt Winjum co-owner of Rhombus Pizza and Brewery; Kay Derry owner of Northern Roots Boutique; Tommy Kenville owner of iSight RPV Services and T-Global Inc. and Rachel Gornowicz owner of Countrywide Sanitation.

The short presentations mostly consisted of people walking across the main stage of the Empire Arts Center and delivering their pitch but one presenter Michael Fridolfs site director for Northrop Grumman near Grand Forks Air Force Base took an approach one might find on the TV show.

Fridolfs and his wife both wearing winter boots walked across the stage in winter parkas with their hoods up. They couple were pitching a large idea that of building an indoor Caribbean-style adventure park. The Fridolfs relocated to Grand Forks from San Diego and Michael Fridolfs commented that it “gets a little cold here.”

Shortly into their presentation Fridolfs said “Why wear this all year round when you can wear this all year round?” and they threw their coats to the ground to reveal summer-style clothing.

Fridolfs said his idea was for a large-scale installation nearly as large as the Alerus Center and the panel of sharks advised him to seek out a casino or hotel to partner with. Winjum urged him to look into Columbia Mall as a possible location.

“Just make sure there’s tequila and Tiki huts” said Gornowicz.

Taking first place that night and $750 in prize money and a nine-month membership to the 701 Co-working space downtown was Brenden Swanson head of coaches at Fenworks an e-sports company. The company is looking to offer their services as an elective course for middle and high school students. The company has already made some partnerships with Minnesota schools.

In second place was Logan Rainey with the company JetCheck the audit business to ensure privately-owned aircraft receive regular maintenance. Rainey received $500 in prize money and a six-month membership.

The company says the law signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis is at odds with guidelines from federal health authorities that would let cruise ships sail in US waters if nearly all passengers and crew members are vaccinated.

“It is a classic state-versus-federal-government issue” said Norwegian's CEO Frank Del Rio. “Lawyers believe that federal law applies and not state law but I’m not a lawyer. And we hope that this doesn’t become a legal football or a political football.”

The company owns Norwegian Cruise Line Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises.

Del Rio told analysts during the company's quarterly earnings call Thursday that if the company can’t operate in Florida it can go to other states or the Caribbean “for ships that otherwise would have gone to Florida ... we certainly hope it doesn't come to that.”

Del Rio said the company is still discussing the matter with DeSantis’ office.

Last month DeSantis signed an order banning businesses from requiring customers to show proof of vaccination and prohibiting state agencies from issuing so-called vaccine passports that document COVID-19 vaccinations and test results. This week he signed legislation that includes the provision about businesses and gives him the power to overrule local measures related to the pandemic such as mask mandates.

DeSantis said the order and the legislation were matters of preserving individual freedom and privacy. On Friday the governor's office did not immediately respond to the Norwegian Cruise Line CEO's comments.

Norwegian aims to have all passengers and crew vaccinated. Guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would let ships skip practice voyages and begin trips with paying customers if 98% of the crew and 95% of passengers are vaccinated and ships take other measures to limit the risk of transmitting the virus that causes COVID-19.

Cruise lines have been barred from sailing in U.S. waters or stopping at U.S. ports since March 2020 early in the pandemic. Some are slowly resuming trips in other countries and requiring that all passengers on those cruises be vaccinated.

The companies are pushing the CDC to let them return to the US this summer although none of the major companies — Norwegian Royal Caribbean Group and Carnival Corp. — have announced any US cruises.

Del Rio said the path to resuming US cruises is “a bit rockier and a bit steeper” than expected and he said a mid-summer restart “could be in jeopardy.”

Norwegian said after the market closed Thursday that it lost $1.37 billion in the first quarter after losing $4 billion last year. The company said however that bookings have picked up raising hopes for a recovery in early 2022.

Its shares rose about 2% in Friday afternoon trading.

It would be the understatement of the year to say that the pandemic has taken its toll on travel and tourism and few sectors have been more affected than the ailing cruise industry. Yet whilst cruises in the US were handed some positive news by the CDC last week some cruise lines are facing other barriers to restarting their domestic operations.

Norwegian Cruise Line has announced that it may be forced to pull out of Florida given the state’s efforts to ban the use of vaccine passports. Here’s everything travelers will need to know about this story.

Florida Bans Vaccine Passports – Prohibitive To Restarting Cruises?

Whilst vaccine passports are starting to be widely used as a solution to restart travel during the pandemic it’s fair to say that not everyone is supportive of the idea – not least Florida’s governor Ron DeSantis. Early last month DeSantis tabled an executive order prohibiting the use of vaccine passports in his state.

According to DeSantis the notion of vaccine passports creates two classes of citizens where only one class – the vaccinated – will be free to “take part in everyday life”. However whilst the move has been welcomed by some anti-vaccine passport travelers it may prove to be prohibitive to the resumption of cruises in the state.

Florida is widely considered to be the cruise capital of the US with millions boarding cruise lines from its ports and billions of dollars generated by the industry as a result. Cruises are so important to Florida that DeSantis even considered taking legal action against the CDC if they were unable to resume in the near future – yet it may be DeSantis’ actions that may keep cruises out of the state of Florida.

That’s because DeSantis’ bill prohibited any government entity from issuing vaccine passports and blocked businesses from requiring any such documentation. However one of the CDC’s conditions for cruise lines to bypass the trial cruise stage was for them to have at least 98% of crew members and 95% of passengers vaccinated. Norwegian have spoken up on the issue and more cruise lines may be set to join them.

Norwegian Leaving Florida? Information For Travelers

Speaking about the issue on Thursday Norwegian’s CEO Frank Del Rio was frank in his take on how the cruise line could proceed in light of the situation in the Sunshine State. Del Rio said:

“At the end of the day cruise ships have motors propellers and rudders and God forbid we can't operate in the state of Florida for whatever reason then there are other states that we do operate from and we can operate from the Caribbean for a ship that otherwise would have gone to Florida.”

Del Rio also went on to explain that he hopes the CDC’s conditions would be able to override DeSantis’ bill describing the issue as a “classic state versus federal government issue” before adding that he had been in contact with the governor’s office.

Should Norwegian make the decision to leave Florida it will not be the first time a cruise line has moved its homeports during the pandemic. Fellow cruise lines such as Celebrity Carnival and Royal Caribbean were also forced to take action and move their homeports as a result of restrictive CDC policies earlier in the year and resumed operations in waters they could freely sail in.

But travel industry leaders in Southeast Alaska are raising concerns about the CDC’s new rules.

The new rules under the agency’s conditional sailing order provide instructions for lines to start “simulated voyages” — those are sailings with volunteers designed to test COVID-19 protocols — and rules for trips with paying passengers.

Travel Juneau’s Liz Perry says a portion of the rules on shore excursions caught her eye. The CDC says cruise ship operators must “prohibit self-guided or independent exploration by passengers during port stops.”

“So there will be no allowance for going into shops restaurants other things independently. All passengers will have to stay inside that cruise bubble. That’s going to be problematic for almost all Southeast communities” Perry said in a phone interview Friday.

And that means many Southeast businesses who rely on adventurous tourists and walk-in traffic could be left out.

Perry says she also fears that small tour operators who don’t sell their excursions onboard cruise ships could be left behind.

A spokesperson for Congressman Don Young said in a statement that the new CDC guidance “leaves much to be desired.” He says the agency has unfairly targeted the cruise industry while allowing planes and trains to travel with tightly-packed passenger compartments. And he says the CDC’s rules are just as “onerous” for vaccinated passengers as those for the unvaccinated — everyone vaccinated or not has to wear a mask in nearly all public spaces and maintain distance from non-household members.

The new rules do not require passengers to be vaccinated against COVID-19. But cruise lines won’t need to run a test voyage if they certify that more than 95% of passengers and 98% of crew members are fully vaccinated.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings CEO Frank Del Rio told investors on a recent earnings call that the vaccination requirement doesn’t go far enough.

“For the life of me I don’t understand 98% and not 100%. So you got a — you have a big ship. You have 1800 crew members on board and you’re going to vaccinate 1764 of them but not 36. I mean what a loophole to allow potential COVID to be introduced in the crew area” Del Rio said. “One hundred percent at least at the beginning I believe should be the model.”

He says the company will require everyone on board to be fully vaccinated.

“There isn’t another venue on Earth not a school not a factory not your office building apartment building much less an entertainment venue like a casino hotel or resort that can make that claim” Del Rio said. “We will be the safest place on Earth.”

Del Rio says his company’s ships will abide by a 74-point plan the company revealed last fall in addition to following the CDC’s guidance.

The Dunleavy administration has been critical of the federal government’s regulations. The state of Alaska recently joined a Florida-led lawsuit challenging the CDC’s restrictions on cruise ships. A Department of Law spokesperson says the state “continues to pursue all avenues for resolution.”

A lack of CDC guidance was one major barrier to this year’s Alaska cruise season. But another major hurdle remains: federal law requires the large cruise ships that visit Alaska to make an international stop but Canadian authorities have banned cruise ships from their waters through next February.

The state’s congressional delegation has sponsored a bill that would waive that requirement for Alaska cruises but an attempt to fast-track the proposal in the Senate failed last month.

Travel Juneau’s Liz Perry says that if any large ships come to Alaska in 2021 it’ll be very late in the season.

“We’re focusing on a season of independent visitors. And for Travel Juneau that has always been our focus. And here in Juneau we’re doing a major fourth quarter push to get as many independent travelers into Juneau as we possibly can” Perry said.

But she says she doesn’t think any Southeast communities have the infrastructure to take on enough independent travelers to make up for another lost cruise season.

The Bill calls for businesses operating in the State to be unable to ask patrons for proof of vaccination. While the cruise lines have been reasonably quiet on the issue and hopeful of resolving this behind closed doors the NCLH CEO has now spoken out.

And he is not the only one firmly against the measures the Governor wishes to incorporate. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava issued a statement where she firmly denounces the measures.

Norwegian Cruise Line Could Move Ships Elsewhere

Governor DeSantis has been a staunch supporter of the cruise industry in recent months; however his most recent Bill does nothing good for the cruise industry and will limit if the cruise lines can conduct business from the State.

Related: Will DeSantis Vaccine Passport Ban Block Cruises From Florida?

The cruise lines need to comply with a wide variety of measures that include a 95% vaccination mandate for passengers onboard the ships if the vessels want to sail from mid-July. And that mandate is what Governor DeSantis is firmly against.

Del Rio now says that if Florida does not allow Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings to require proof of COVID-19 vaccination something the line has committed itself to for passengers and crew it will take its ships elsewhere.

The threat came during the earnings call earlier this week a few days after DeSantis signed the Bill into law. As the world’s third-largest cruise operator Norwegian Cruise Line makes significant contributions to the Florida economy something Del Rio will take away if he needs to:

NCLH President and CEO Frank Del Rio:

“At the end of the day cruise ships have motors propellers and rudders and God forbid we can’t operate in the State of Florida for whatever reason then there are other states that we do operate from. And we can operate from the Caribbean for ships that otherwise would’ve gone to Florida.”

With a wide variety of ports in the near vicinity and Norwegian having already rescheduled ships to nearby ports it will likely not be an empty threat from Del Rio someone who has been fighting for his cruise company in recent weeks.

To make things more interesting for the cruise lines Norwegian sees excellent returns on its voyages from the Dominican Republic something which should worry Governor DeSantis:

Frank Del Rio:

“We’re very encouraged with the vessel out of the Dominican Republic. The DR has a very good airlift to the U.S. I believe it’s the #1 destination for Americans to the Caribbean. And who knows? That vessel might prove to be so profitable there that it never returns back to U.S. waters. Which would be again one of the economic casualties of this prolonged CDC-induced suspension.”

Miami-Dade Mayor Has a Say

Frank Del Rio is certainly not alone in his opposition of the DeSantis Bill; Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava warned Governor DeSantis not to stand in the way of a restart of cruising in the State of Florida.

With the majority of ships sailing from Florida in the Miami Dade area the Mayor is right to be mindful of the hundreds of thousands of constituents affected by a cruise lines’ departure from the State.

Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava:

“Preventing private cruise companies from setting policies to keep customers and workers safe puts Floridians’ lives needlessly at risk and is contrary to the free enterprise that makes this country great. Now this decision could result in thousands of jobs leaving South Florida at this critical moment for our economic recovery.”

According to the Mayor the livelihood of thousands of families hangs in the balance if Norwegian does decide to leave the State.

“This isn’t about politics; it’s about the livelihoods of so many families who have already struggled so much this year. I urge the Governor: Don’t stand in the way of the safe restart of cruising – a cornerstone of our regional and State economy.”

Still Much Work To Do

It is the second mountain the cruise industry will have to climb before setting sail again this summer. It seems unlikely DeSantis will be backing out of his policy especially now his name is in the minds of many as a running mate for a possible vice-president position. There is a way out though as Frank Del Rio believes the law possibly does not affect the cruise industry:

“We’ve had discussions with the Governor’s office. Those continue but it is a classic state versus federal government issue. Legally lawyers believe that federal law applies and not state law but I’m not a lawyer. And we hope that this hasn’t become a legal football or a political football.”

The CDC’s requirements have also become significantly more difficult to pass since the update earlier this week.

Industry lobby group Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) reacted in a statement. The group says it sees a long road ahead for the cruise lines but CLIA is happy to see the CDC work towards its commitments towards the industry. It also warns of the consequences of a delayed resumption while pointing out the successful restart of cruising elsewhere in the world:

Meanwhile nearly half a million American jobs and livelihoods continue to hang in the balance. The cruise industry will continue to go above and beyond to meet the requirements of the CDC building on the ongoing resumption of operations taking place in other parts of the world and the demonstrated success of the industry’s protocols and public health measures.

Between all the noise it is difficult to pinpoint a date and time when we will see a cruising restart be it from Florida or elsewhere in the United States. With these many obstacles it is easy to see why cruise companies could decide to move their vessels to other nearby ports in the Caribbean.

It would save the cruise lines an incredible amount of money and sail from ports that are happy to have the ships instead of ports of call or homeports where the rules and regulations prevent the companies from conducting business."

Resident Evil Village is the latest entry in the iconic horror series and not only did we love the game in our review we've also been impressed with how well the game runs on PCs with even lower powered graphics cards like the RTX 3060 putting in a fantastic performance.

The fact that it runs so well on PC while also looking mightily impressive and supporting atmospheric effects like ray tracing has meant we couldn't wait to try it out at 8K.

We've tested a range of modern games such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Watch Dogs: Legion at the demanding 7680 x 4320 resolution and even the mighty RTX 3090 currently the most powerful gaming GPU on the market today (if you can find one) struggled to reach acceptable frame rates without some serious tinkering.

Hopefully the fine work Capcom has put into the PC port of Resident Evil Village could give this game a better chance of running at the holy grail of ultra-high definition gaming: 8K at 60FPS. Let's find out how it does.

(Image credit: Capcom)

Resident Evil Village 8K performance

As usual we started out our tests with the default settings which had most things set to 'High' with 8GB of textures and an overall memory usage of 15GB. The RTX 3090 comes with 24GB of the stuff so that's not an issue though even the high-end RTX 3080 with 10GB won't be able to handle that.

It looked fantastic but it played... not so well. It actually hit an average of 37.6 fps which is pretty impressive at 8K on high settings with even the minimum framerates not going below 30 fps. We usually say that 30 fps is the bare minimum for an enjoyable gaming experience and so the fact that Resident Evil Village goes above that at 8K on high settings is impressive.

However 60 fps is our goal here and the game feels like it was made for that kind of frame rate so even though 30 fps is acceptable the game feels sluggish. Also while most things are set to 'high' ray tracing is off. Turning it on (but keeping it low) didn't impact the frame rates that much however.

There are lots of display settings to tweak including textures which has a number of options that are still labelled as 'high'. By knocking a few options down a single step while keeping things on 'high' saw a slight fps bump to 38 fps.

Putting textures to the lowest setting that is still labelled 'high' with 0.25GB of memory usage and an overall usage of 7.4GB (so the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 can handle it) saw another bump to 42.6 fps. The game still looked great and it started to feel more responsive as well.

Knocking all settings to medium gave us an average frame rate at 8K of 43.4 fps. However it's here that the drop in visual fidelity was noticeable with pop-ins and rougher textures. In a horror game that relies on atmosphere the bump in frame rates at 8K just didn't seem worth it.

But could we hit 60 fps at 8K?

Open this image in a new tab for the full 8K resolution (Image credit: Capcom)

No.

Even at lowest settings we just got 47.5 fps. Turning off all additional graphical features such as volumetric lighting allowed us to eke out a bit more performance (hitting 52 fps on average) but the hit to the graphics was too much to bear. While it certainly didn't look awful the game felt lifeless and flat. It feels like you're missing out on an important part of the game and playing at 8K isn't worth that compromise - especially when any benefits from playing at such a high resolution are diminished when you start drastically lowering texture quality.

The fact that Resident Evil Village looks - and runs - so well at 4K on PC means that this is still the best resolution to play at as you get gorgeous image quality and atmosphere.

So after a promising start Resident Evil Village needs too many compromises to play at 8K unless you're happy with 30 fps on a PC that costs well over $2000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3djY2Z0ZWNoLmNvbS9nYWxheC1sYXVuY2hlcy1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDgwLXJ0eC0zMDcwLWxoci1saXRlLWhhc2gtcmF0ZS1ncmFwaGljcy1jYXJkcy10by1jb21iYXQtY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3ktbWluaW5nL9IBhAFodHRwczovL3djY2Z0ZWNoLmNvbS9nYWxheC1sYXVuY2hlcy1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDgwLXJ0eC0zMDcwLWxoci1saXRlLWhhc2gtcmF0ZS1ncmFwaGljcy1jYXJkcy10by1jb21iYXQtY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3ktbWluaW5nL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GALAX Officially Launches GeForce RTX 3080 & RTX 3070 LHR ‘Lower Hash Rate’ Graphics Cards To Combat GPU Cryptocurrency Mining,"GALAX is the first graphics card manufacturer to confirm NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 LHR (Lower Hash Rate) series which is designed to combat cryptocurrency mining. The company has launched two cards under this category which are based on the new Ampere GPU SKUs.

GALAX Launches GeForce RTX 3080 & RTX 3070 LHR Series Graphics Cards Featuring Brand New Ampere GPU SKUs To Tackle Cryptocurrency Mining

The GALAX GeForce RTX 3080 LHR and GeForce RTX 3070 LHR graphics cards are custom designs and nothing on these cards is changed except the underlying GPU SKU which has been updated to GA102-202 (LHR) for the RTX 3080 and GA104-302 (LHR) for the GeForce RTX 3070. With these new GPUs installed the graphics cards will be limited to a 50% hash rate in cryptocurrency mining algos making them unprofitable in such cases.

2 of 9

Following are all the new NVIDIA Ampere GA**2 SKUs that you can expect:

NVIDIA RTX 3090 - GA102-300-A1 -> GA102-302-A1

NVIDIA RTX 3080 - GA102-200-A1 -> GA102-202-A1

NVIDIA RTX 3070 - GA104-300-A1 -> GA104-302-A1

NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti - GA104-200-A1 -> GA104-202-A1

NVIDIA RTX 3060 - GA106-300-A1 -> GA106-302-A1

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 standard variants were able to deliver up to 100-110 MH/s in ETH while the RTX 3070 nets you around 55-60 MH/s in ETH. But with half hash rate you can expect an RTX 3080 to end up around a 3070 deliver less than 50 MH/s & the 3070 to fall below 30 MH/s as reported by GALAX itself. This would mean that cryptocurrency miners will have to look for other more profitable graphics chips such as the CMP (Cryptocurrency Mining Processor) lineup from NVIDIA.

The new GALAX GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3070 LHR series graphics cards are titled the FG series. We know what GALAX's SG (Serious Gaming) brand means but we aren't sure what FG means. Since GALAX has already outed its LHR lineup we can also expect other manufacturers to follow suit and release their own GeForce RTX 30 LHR series cards. The recent reports do state that the cards are being prioritized to E-cafes in China and it will be hard for actual gamers to get their hands on the cards till 2H of 2021.

Road2 was established through a collaboration between the business development center MATI Haifa computer system and service company NVIDIA and the Israel Innovation Authority (IIA).

The launch was celebrated with a live in-person event as Israel opens its physical spaces again following a successful vaccination rollout and somewhat of a return to normalcy within the country. The event was attended by industry leaders such as NVIDIA’s Arik Kol Dr. Ami Appelbaum Chairman of Israel Innovation Authority; Mooly Eden Former Senior V.P at Intel Corporation. President of Intel Israel; and Ruth Alon founder and former CEO of NetVision among others.

Road2 will help startups to forge relationships with industry-specific entities that can help with collaborations POCs and support of strategic partnerships. It is currently calling on startups in the fields of digital health energy and the environment industry 4.0 and smart transportation to join the hub. Road2 received NIS 50 million ($15.3 million) in investment half of which came from the IIA.

""Road2 was established to empower the brilliant minds of Haifa to develop their ideas and to attract additional innovative startups from the Northern area of Israel” said Eitan Kyiet CEO of Road2. “Under the unique model we've created young startups can find a hub with unprecedented access to the most advanced AI lab in the country and we’re topping that with close mentorship and guidance from senior high-tech industry executives who operate in the area.""

Haifa is home to R&D centers belonging to some of the world’s biggest tech giants including Google Amazon Philips IBM and others. The city is also home to the Technion a leading academic institution for engineering. The new AI lab will give startups access to computing capabilities provided by NVIDIA based on its NVIDIA DGX A100 system as well as the opportunity to work with NVIDIA Inception an acceleration platform supporting 7500 AI startups around the world.

Jeff Herbst VP of Business Development and Head of NVIDIA Inception added: ""Our collaboration with the Road2 Incubator to promote and accelerate AI startups in the Haifa and northern regions which are renowned for their human capital and impact on the local technology industry aims to fuel entrepreneurs and projects that can profoundly affect Israel and the world.”

Road2 nominated a list of industry experts to its advisory board some of whom are native Haifans including Eyal Waldman founder of Mellanox which was acquired by NVIDIA. As one of the co-founders of Road2 Waldman explained how: “its goal is to make a significant mark on the industry by identifying companies with a dramatic social impact footprint.”

“Haifa has tremendous entrepreneurial potential and significant talent anchored there” added Dr. Ami Appelbaum Chairman of the Israel Innovation Authority. “It's important to strive toward building an entrepreneurial ecosystem in the city which will serve as a magnet for the entire northern region.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9nYWxheC1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDgwLXJ0eC0zMDcwLWV0aGVyZXVtLW5lcmbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Galax Launches First GeForce RTX 3080 RTX 3070 With Ethereum Nerf,"Galax (via VideoCardz) has re-released the brand's GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 Black General graphics cards with Nvidia's revamped Ampere silicon which cracks down on Ethereum mining.

The new graphics cards with the anti-mining limiter are identical to the previous revisions in every way starting from the packaging to the graphics card's aesthetics. According to the previous rumors Nvidia has reportedly asked its AIB partners to differentiate the fresh variants from the prior ones to avoid confusion among consumers. The Lite Hash Rate (LHR) moniker was rumored to be the internal codename for the new series.

We don't know for sure if Nvidia has specific guidelines in place of how vendors should label the new graphics cards or if they have the freedom to market the graphics cards as they please. In Galax's case the manufacturer is adding the ""FG"" termination to the model name. The suffix could denote something or it could just be a set of randomly chosen letters.

Obviously manufacturers will have to update or release new product pages for the revised graphics cards. For example Galax specifically mentions that the GeForce RTX 3080 Black General [FG] uses the GA102-202 (LHR) silicon and the Ethereum mining performance is capped to around 43 MH/s. The GeForce RTX 3070 Black General [FG] on the other hand now employs the GA104-302 (LHR) with a restricted Ethereum hash rate of 25 MH/s.

Word on the street is that Nvidia will ship its partners the new Ampere silicon in the middle of May so we could see a potential release in June at the latest. Thus far the GeForce RTX 3080 RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 are the only SKUs that will get the anti-mining treatment. Nvidia has allegedly forsaken the GeForce RTX 3090 because the flagship part is simply too expensive to be a key player in the cryptomining game. On the contrary the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti has proven to be a mining monster in a previous leak. Fortunately the approaching Ampere graphics card should also be equipped with the reworked Ampere silicon if the rumblings are to be believed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzLmNvLnVrL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvZ2FtaW5nLzE0MzMwMjIvR0ZOLUdlRm9yY2UtTk9XLWdldHMtbW9yZS10aGFuLTYwLWdhbWVzLWluLU1heS1hcy1wYXJ0LW9mLWJpZ2dlc3QtdXBkYXRlLXlldC1OVklESUHSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhwcmVzcy5jby51ay9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2dhbWluZy8xNDMzMDIyL0dGTi1HZUZvcmNlLU5PVy1nZXRzLW1vcmUtdGhhbi02MC1nYW1lcy1pbi1NYXktYXMtcGFydC1vZi1iaWdnZXN0LXVwZGF0ZS15ZXQtTlZJRElBL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GFN GeForce Now gets more than 60 games in May as part of HUGE update,"NVIDIA has announced plans to add more than 60 PC games to the GeForce NOW library in May.

UNC won the doubles point to gain the early 1-0 lead then received singles victories from Elizabeth Scotty (6-2 6-0) Sara Daavettila (6-3 6-1) and Fiona Crawley (6-2 6-4) to clinch its spot in the next round.

Megan Plain took a few steps into Old Dominion University's Monarch Esports Arena stopped to look around and smiled. ""This place is sick"" she said.

Plain is a WTKR sports reporter and is supposed to maintain a sense of impartiality. But she's a gamer and couldn't contain her excitement.

By ""sick"" she meant the new ODU Esports Arena is awesome.

And it clearly is.

Walk up the stairs at the Webb Student Center and step into the Old Dominion University Esports Arena and you'll feel like you've stepped into another world.

Bathed in blue yellow and purple light the 2400-square-foot space is a gamer's dream come true.

There are 50 gaming computers and consoles and it's clear from the light blue lights on the keyboards and mouses the cool logos on the computers the ergonomic gaming chairs the powerful processors and tons of memory inside each computer that this is a high-end gaming center.

Is it a true arena? While there aren't spectator seats it is where ODU's Esports varsity team will compete in the National Association of Collegiate Esports and in that sense it is indeed.

It has a ""home-court"" feel with ODU Esports logos on every wall. The back wall is covered with a shadow of a lion's face in dark blue and there are futuristic lights on the walls and ceilings.

ODU already has 80 varsity members on 16 teams across 10 game titles including those you might expect: Call of Duty Fortnite and Rocket League. And officials hope to have more than 100 members during the fall.

The students will compete on a row of 12 computers raised a few feet above the floor on the back wall facing forward. There is also a studio nearby in which varsity games can be broadcast on the internet.

While esports is not an official NCAA sport the team wears official ODU jerseys dark blue and silver with ODU ESPORTS across the front along with an Under Armour insignia - the same worn by varsity sports teams. Old Dominion University became the first four-year public institution in Virginia to join the world of esports with a varsity program launched in fall 2020.

""We're developing a program here similar to an athletic program"" said Grant Deppen assistant director of ODU's intramural sports and esports programs and the force behind founding ODU esports.

""We recruit students here to be quality students first and to represent the University well just like athletics does.""

ODU doesn't offer gaming scholarships but Deppen said that may come down the road.

What it does offer is a first-class esports center that a lot of ODU's competitors in Virginia and nearby states don't have.

About 26% of Gen Z members (ages 14-24) who responded to a Variety Magazine survey a few weeks ago indicated that video gaming is their entertainment activity of choice. In all 87% of Gen Z-ers play video games daily or weekly.

Not only does ODU offer the chance to compete nationally for an esports team it also offers the chance to study video game design. A degree in one of two interdisciplinary courses of study can lead to careers as a game designer multimedia artist producer or director.

ODU also offers other majors that may appeal to gamers: graphic design sports management modeling and simulation computer engineering and cybersecurity.

There is also a gaming living-learning community in the new Hugo A. Owens House residence hall. Owens House includes classes and labs for gaming students.

The ODU Esports Arena is a short walk up 49th Street from Owens House and has four computer terminals set aside for game-design students.

Don Stansberry vice president of student engagement and enrollment services (SEES) is also hopeful that communications students will become involved in broadcasting games from the state-of-the-art control center. Thousands of games are broadcast on the internet on any given day.

But the facility isn't just for hardcore gamers.

If you're into gaming just for the fun of it or even if you're a novice there are two dozen computers you can use and hundreds of games you can play from ODU's extensive library.

""It's another way of learning of engaging of making friends and building a community"" Stansberry said. ""You can be on the varsity team or come in and play with friends or come in and play with people around the world.""

The arena was created through the combined efforts of SEES President John R. Broderick the Office of Development Office of Strategic Communication and Marketing Facilities Management and Construction and Information Technology Services which wired and installed all the high-tech gadgetry.

Coulson Thomas director of recreation and wellness and Bridget Weikel associate dean of students joined Stansberry and Deppen at the grand opening in late April.

Although esports has been a part of ODU for a year students have mostly been competing from their homes because of the pandemic.

Deppen said he expects hundreds of students to use the facility in the fall semester assuming that COVID restrictions have been lifted.

ODU's esports program began Stansberry said when Deppen and senior student Patrick Cornejo presented a proposal to a SEES committee almost two years ago.

""They sold us"" Stansberry said even if at the time officials weren't quite aware of where esports would take them. ""None of this would have happened without Grant.""

Stansberry said that in spite of the pandemic ODU's esports program has attracted students and will attract far more in the future.

""The ways in which students are getting involved on campus are changing"" Stansberry said. ""And this is a new form of engagement for so many of our students.

""When students are thinking about what could be unique about their college experience when they are comparing one institution to another it's often things like this that make us unique.

""This tells students that we know they are changing and that ODU is changing with them.""

Deppen has big plans for ODU's varsity team and is in a sense is acting as the team's head coach. He's not only organized the team but he is also recruiting players.

Deppen said that he is constantly researching the Next Collegiate Student Athlete a Web site that profiles potential gamers just like other services profile football and basketball prospects.

""I have five or six conversations a week with students interested in coming to ODU"" he said. ""We have students interested in ODU from all over the world. We're talking to a student in South Africa. Without our esports program he probably never would have heard of ODU. But he has now applied to the University. This speaks to the global side of esports and how much we can leverage this.""

Luke Reed a freshman from Norfolk Christian High and Matt Widenhouse a sophomore from Maryland are members of the varsity team who had advice for ODU students.

Widenhouse said students should not be intimidated that even if they don't know a lot about video games they should come out and give the Esports Arena a try.

""Don't be afraid to get involved"" he said. ""Come in and at least take a look around.""

Both he and Reed urged students to try out for the varsity but only if they are solid academically.

""You've got to get your grades set first and worry about this later"" Reed said.

""And don't be afraid to try out for a team. The collegiate scene is growing and there are a lot of opportunities.""

As he watched dozens of students glued to their computer screens Stansberry smiled.

""The Esports Arena has exceeded my expectations"" he said. ""It is absolutely amazing.

""What I really like about it is that while it has space for our varsity team it also has different engagement opportunities for all of our students.

""The team has done a great job of pulling all of these pieces together and creating a great facility.""

Burch who had never played a professional game was planning to start the season with the team’s Low-A affiliate in Myrtle Beach South Carolina.

“He said ‘Hey Burch hit in the second round (of batting practice) shower up come find me — you’re heading to Iowa’” Burch recalled. “It all happened so fast.”

It was a giant surprise for Burch. The 23-year-old infielder was about to make the rare move of bypassing every other minor-league affiliate and going directly to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs to start his professional career. Burch made his debut on Thursday night against the Indianapolis Indians.

“Having a professional debut in itself was a dream nonetheless being able to do it with the Triple-A squad it’s a pretty surreal moment"" Burch said. ""I’m going to have fun with it and I’m looking to just soak everything in and learn as much as I can and have a whole lot of fun doing it.”

It’s likely to be a short-lived experience for Burch who was added to Iowa’s depleted roster on Thursday. Iowa was already without Trent Giambrone who left to be with his ill father and Patrick Wisdom whose wife was giving birth. So Iowa was in desperate need of another player. That’s how Burch entered the picture.

Burch a former star at Old Dominion was still building up for the start of the season in Arizona. He was not selected in the abbreviated 2020 draft. In August he signed a minor-league deal with the Cubs. Because the COVID-19 pandemic canceled the 2020 Minor League Baseball season Burch never got to play in a pro game. Instead his first taste of pro ball was at the extended spring training site in Mesa.

PREVIOUSLY:

Burch was told that his 2021 season likely would start at Myrtle Beach. If everything went well he could possibly rise to High-A South Bend. But all those plans changed when the Cubs decided to bring up Burch to fill out Iowa's roster. When Burch got the news he finished his round of batting practice packed up his stuff took a golf cart back to his hotel and got his things in order. Two and a half hours later he was on a flight destined for Des Moines.

“I don’t think it really hit me until I was sitting on a plane and we touched down in Iowa” Burch said.

His last game action came in 2020 with the Peninsula Pilots of the Coastal Plain Summer League. Iowa manager Marty Pevey wasted no time using him. Burch was insert into Thursday night’s game as a defensive substitution in the eighth inning. Burch said he wasn’t nervous.

“I wouldn’t say nervous but anxious” he said. “I think nervousness comes at least in my mind with some fear or doubt whereas anxiousness or a little bit of butterflies that show I’m alive.”

Burch got his first start on Friday night. It was a rocky debut — 0-for-4 with three strikeouts and a fielding error.

The scheme labelled PARETO involved nearly a million infected mobile devices pretending to be millions of people watching ads on smart TVs and other devices. This in turn caused invalid traffic on streaming platforms.

Omnicom Media Group The Trade Desk and Magnite flagship members of The Human Collective—a newly launched initiative that brings together players throughout digital advertising to create a collectively protected ecosystem—collaborated with HUMAN with the support of Google and Roku in leading the disruption efforts.

In short PARETO is nearly a million infected mobile Android devices pretending to be millions of people watching ads on smart TVs and other devices. The botnet used dozens of mobile apps to impersonate or spoof more than 6000 CTV apps accounting for an average of 650 million ad requests every day.

HUMAN’s Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team found the PARETO operation in 2020 and has been working with the HUMAN team to prevent its impacts to clients ever since. The operation is named for The Pareto Principle an economics concept that dictates that 80% of the impact in any given situation is carried out by only 20% of the actors.

“CTV provides massive opportunities for streaming services and brands to engage with consumers through compelling content and advertising” said HUMAN CEO and Co-Founder Tamer Hassan. “Because of this opportunity it is incredibly important for the CTV ecosystem and brands to work together through a collectively protected advertising supply chain to ensure fraud is recognized addressed and eliminated as quickly as possible.”

PARETO worked by spoofing signals within malicious Android mobile apps to impersonate consumer TV streaming products running Fire OS tvOS Roku OS and other prominent CTV platforms. The botnet took advantage of digital shifts that were accelerated by the pandemic hiding in the noise in order to trick advertisers and technology platforms into believing ads were being shown on CTVs. This particular approach is lucrative for fraudsters as pricing for ads on connected TVs is often substantially higher than pricing on mobile devices or on the web.

“We appreciate the work of the research community and value our collaboration with HUMAN” said Per Bjorke Product Manager Ad Traffic Quality at Google. “Responsible disclosure and collaboration benefits the entire ecosystem and we look forward to working with them on additional research in the future.”

The PARETO operation has been incredibly sophisticated and evasive over the last year. However for each spoofing cycle as PARETO launched a new disguise for their fake traffic HUMAN was able to detect and continuously innovate techniques to protect our customers with HUMAN’s Advertising Integrity solution. Finally after a year of this continuous and effective threat identification and resolution and driven by a sequence of counter measures and PARETO adaptations HUMAN and its partners—including Omnicom Media Group The Trade Desk Magnite Google and Roku—disrupted the operation.

“Roku is committed to fighting ad fraud in every form and to the development of leading practices for staying ahead of fraud globally. We were pleased to support HUMAN’s efforts to disrupt the PARETO operation. While this scheme impacted less than 0.1% of Roku devices our approach to creating a premium curated advertising marketplace ensured that not a single Roku advertiser was ever at risk of being impacted” said Willard Simmons VP of Product Management at Roku. “The PARETO case presents yet another reminder of the importance of taking fraud seriously working with the best fraud detection partners and ensuring both the supply and demand side of the advertising ecosystem works only with trusted verified partners.”

HUMAN also observed a far smaller but connected effort attempting to spoof consumer streaming platforms. The operation detected a single developer on Roku’s Channel Store with apps connected to PARETO. The apps linked to the developer impacting less than one half of one percent of Roku’s active devices globally were designed to communicate with the server that operates the PARETO botnet. The primary operation was associated with 29 Android apps and the secondary operation was associated with one Roku developer delivering the malware to infected devices. These apps have all been removed from the marketplaces on which they were operating and lists of the apps are available as appendices to HUMAN’s technical analysis of the botnet. Roku has also permanently disconnected the impacted apps from use.

“What’s especially striking about this operation is its scale and sophistication” said HUMAN Chief Scientist Michael McNally. “The actors behind PARETO have a fundamental understanding of numerous aspects of advertising technology and used that to their advantage in how they hid their work within the CTV ecosystem. Their efforts included low-level network protocol spoofing which is especially hard to detect but which our team at HUMAN spotted.”

The Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team used numerous tools to identify the sources of the botnet whose information has been shared with law enforcement. To learn more about the PARETO operation visit humansecurity.com/pareto.

The six-building complex is home to 4.3 million square feet of offices that account for the lion’s share of Mack-Cali’s total 6.8 million square-foot portfolio. Most are in the interlocked buildings known as Harborside 1 2 and 3.

Previously associated with back-office space they’re nearing completion of more than $100 million in improvements aimed at drawing a more diverse tenant roster for headquarters use and better integrating the commercial buildings into the thriving Jersey City community around them.

“We’ll be much more proactive in pursuing tenants from Manhattan” said senior vice president of leasing Ed Guiltinan. Realty Check readers long knew him as top leasing honcho of Rockefeller Group where he played a key role in repositioning that firm’s Sixth Avenue towers including the former Time + Life Building.

Guiltinan was recruited to Mack-Cali last October as part of the publicly traded developer’s full-court press to revitalize and re-tenant Harborside. About 40 percent of its office space is currently available. However the figure is misleadingly high since it includes 420000 square feet at Harborside 1 which was kept mostly vacant as it underwent a sea-change in improvements. Also on board are crack CBRE leasing teams including a Manhattan group headed by regional CEO Mary Ann Tighe.

Mack-Cali took the Harborside plunge in 1996 when it bought buildings 1 2 and 3 -– 1920s structures that were the Pennsylvania Railroad’s New York terminus prior to the construction of Penn Station in Manhattan.

Although functional the complex soon became dated as newer properties offered better amenities and more sophisticated infrastructure. Friends who worked at Harborside years ago recalled a joyless “nowhere” atmosphere lacking in shopping eating and service options.

Mack-Cali started a “cool factor” turnaround about four years ago. In 2019 it installed a high-quality District Kitchen food hall in Harborside 3. It added attractive artwork throughout the complex upgraded lobbies and created new pedestrian corridors. Lounges were given the industrial-aesthetic treatment in homage to the area’s past.

A 1980s-vintage glass-roof atrium between buildings 2 and 3 is being warmed up with new seating. A big Whole Foods store –- which is also an office tenant -– will open soon at a different building at the site.

The redevelopment of Harborside 1 which will open to tenants by year’s end is the icing on the cake. The eight-story building has a new facade a redesigned lobby with direct access to indoor retail chosen to support Harborside tenants and a fourth-floor tenants’ terrace with views of Manhattan and the river. The building aims to achieve LEED-Gold certification for new energy-conserving mechanicals.

Guiltinan said Harborside 1’s 65000-square-foot floor plates high ceilings and open views should appeal especially to media and creative tenants in contrast to the more traditional corporate appeal of 1-million square-foot Harborside 5 to the west.

CBRE’s Tighe said the repositioning “is designed to meet this moment. The virtually column-free large floors” and “waterfront-facing light-filled spaces” accommodate a broad range of uses.” Current Harborside tenants include Omnicom Whole Foods’ regional offices E*Trade Brown Brothers Harriman and Arch Insurance. Asking rents are in the low $40s to low $50s per square foot Guiltinan said.

Meanwhile Mack-Cali is making Harborside more welcoming to local residents as well as to tenants. (The company also owns apartment buildings adjacent to the office sites). Brooklyn-born open-air food market Smorgasburg will open this summer at a parking lot site. The eastern side of Hudson Street which runs parallel to the office buildings is being turned into a pedestrian plaza with seating a beer garden and what Guiltinan called “fun things” starting in June.

Great Performances founder Liz Neumark shows off the kitchen of her new Bruckner Building headquarters.

We reported in January 2019 that premier caterer Great Performances –- which serves the Plaza Hotel grand ballroom and Jazz at Lincoln Center -– was moving from Hudson Square to a much larger facility in the Bronx. The 41000-square-foot commitment later swelled to 51000 square feet. And last week after a $7.7 million buildout owner Liz Neumark and state and city officials cut the ribbon on the new home in the redeveloped Bruckner Building a former factory at 2417 Third Ave.

The facility includes a state-of-the-art 19000-square-foot kitchen three times larger than the original as well as a warehouse offices training space and the nonprofit Sylvia Center for educating kids in the connection between food and health.

“It’s an exciting new chapter in our 40-year history” Neumark said that expresses optimism “in our future that of the Bronx and of the city’s hospitality sector as a whole” in the pandemic’s wake.",,,,,,,,,

However depending on who you ask it's always good to keep your options open. A material that keeps popping up in research studies is cuprous oxide (or copper (I) oxide).

Cuprous oxide was one of the earliest materials found to have semiconducting properties. This article explores some benefits and uses of this unique material.

What Is Cuprous/Copper Oxide?

Cuprous oxide is a semiconductor known for its variety of bandgaps ranging from 2.0–2.2 eV and its photovoltaic properties. As a p-type oxide of copper with the chemical formula Cu 2 O it can exist as a thin film or a nanoparticle offering novel physical features useful for fundamental research due to its low costs.

Over the last few decades researchers have identified various methods for synthesizing cuprous oxide. A few techniques discovered are:

Even with extensive research a significant hurdle with employing most of these methods is producing a mixture phase of Cu CuO and Cu 2 O resulting in the sparse application of cuprous oxide as a semiconductor.

Preparing cuprous oxide (Cu 2 O) by reactive sputtering ((a) Cu film (100% Ar) (b) Cu2O film (95:5) (c) Cu 2 O film (90:10) and (d) Cu2O film (80:20)). Image used courtesy of Dolai et al

Despite this shortcoming in applications it does have potential use in solar cells transparent electronics rechargeable lithium battery electrodes and memristors.

Research on Cuprous Oxide's Electronic Properties

Research has been ongoing with cuprous oxide namely to learn its electronic properties and potential as a semiconductor material.

One research team reported enhancing its optical properties for applications in photocatalysis and sensor devices when it is doped with 12.5% zinc. According to another group doping it in a 0.34%-concentrated F element reduces its band-gap to 1.91 eV from 1.96 eV. However it increases its photovoltage and photocurrent density to 0.4457 V and 2.79 mA/cm2 respectively.

Other notable studies include:

These serve as indications that there are consistent improvements on cuprous oxide's properties that may extend its range of applications.

Technological Applications

The main applications of cuprous oxide in electronics include supercapacitors Li-ion batteries photocatalysis solar energy conversion and sensing applications. Though these applications currently are limited they are still worth exploring.

Supercapacitors and Electrodes for Lithium-ion Batteries

Cuprous oxide is suitable for use as an anode material in Li-ion batteries because of its controllable structure polymorphic forms and high cycling capacity.

Photocatalysis and Solar Energy Conversion

Due to an abundance of copper and oxygen in nature appropriate band-gap for visible light absorption and relatively easy and cheaper fabrication cuprous oxide is suitable for large-scale solar energy conversion.

Sensing

Cuprous oxide thin films can be used for gas sensing by adsorbing gas molecules on its surface which consequently causes a noticeable electrical conductivity change. Precisely the thermal oxidation-synthesized cuprous oxide can sense methane gas at high sensitivity fast response and recovery times.

Comparing Cuprous Oxide to Si and GaN

The table below shows a comparison between the semiconductor properties mentioned above.

Cuprous Oxide Si GaN Crystal Structure Cubic Crystal Structure Diamond Cubic Crystal Structure Wurtzite Crystal Structure Bandgap 2.137 eV 1.1 eV 3.2 eV Electron Mobility 100 cm2/Vs 1500 cm2/Vs 2000 cm2/Vs

Analyzing the above table confirms that the three semiconductors have different crystal structures resulting from the differences in their unit cells. A high band-gap for GaN implies that it requires higher energy to excite valence electrons into the semiconductor's conduction band. However cuprous oxide and Si with relatively lower band-gap require lesser energy making them the preferred choice if bandgap is the deciding factor.

Overall cuprous oxide seemed to be at a disadvantage over the other two when considering electron mobility meaning that electrons move faster in Si and GaN. Despite this setback with further research cuprous oxide might have potential depending on its application.

The shortage is crippling players in industries as diverse and far afield as automotives and smartphones—though carmakers have it the worst.

Apple for example has staggered the release of new iPhones to adjust for reduced supply. Ford meanwhile is predicting that the shortage of chips—used for onboard computers that control features like speedometers and antilock brake systems—will result in a $2.5 billion reduction in operating profit as the automaker mothballs factories. It expects production to fall by half in the second quarter.

Semiconductor manufacturers are already adding more capacity to meet future projections and executives on the supply side of semiconductors have begun to speculate when the shortage which emerged at the end of 2020 will ease.

There’s consensus that supply will remain tight throughout 2021. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger predicts the shortage will persist for a “couple of years.” German chipmaker Infineon likewise suspects supply to finally meet demand in 2023.

But the good news is that the shortage isn’t the result of a genuine lack of resources such as a dearth of the raw silicon that forms the wafer base for semiconductors; it’s just a disequilibrium between demand and supply. Rebalancing will require expanding capacity—and time.

Why is there a global chip shortage?

Demand for semiconductors experiences natural peaks and troughs since manufacturers tend to launch new deliverables such as the latest smartphone model or the newest car marque seasonally. But in 2020 a number of factors converged to create an unexpected peak.

In May last year the Trump administration’s imposed sanctions against Huawei Technologies which blocked the Chinese smartphone maker from purchasing semiconductors made with U.S. technology. The blockade which gave suppliers 120 days to comply prompted Huawei to increase orders and stockpile chips ahead of the ban.

“After the U.S. placed sanctions on Huawei other Chinese smartphone makers started increasing semiconductor orders too because they wanted to take market share left by Huawei” says Brady Wang an analyst at Counterpoint Research. “That was one of the triggers for the shortage now.”

Next the pandemic forced millions to shelter and work at home increasing orders for personal electronics which run on chips. China’s exports of laptop computers surged 9.8% in the first half of 2020 meeting the sudden demand for home offices. The pandemic also forced some chipmakers to temporarily shut down production lines introducing a dip on the supply-side.

Perhaps more importantly automakers expected the pandemic to reduce new car sales and they cut production outlook and canceled their orders for semiconductors as a result. But the pandemic downturn was less pronounced than automakers expected and consumer demand came roaring back as major economies rolled out vaccines.

Automakers that had canceled semiconductor purchases rushed to put in new orders but found themselves at the back of a line front-loaded with personal electronics makers. Daniel Nenni founder of chip information forum SemiWiki says “Calling it a shortage is really not the case. It was just bad supply-chain management.”

Certainly not all automakers have been hit equally. Nissan chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta told Bloomberg that the chip shortage is something that every company “could have avoided” with better supply-chain management. Nissan which has issued rolling stoppages on production lines because it can’t source the chips it needs to complete orders is among the companies that could have prepared better.

Meanwhile Toyota which keeps a close eye on its supply chains began stockpiling chips early and has coasted through the shortage.

Supply side

On a call with journalists on Wednesday German chipmaker Infineon which specializes in automotive chipsets said automakers had learned their lesson from the chip shortage and that “this idea of ordering parts when you need them and canceling them then when you don’t will not return.”

But the semiconductor industry has other bottlenecks that are harder to resolve. Some 80% of the world’s chip supply—and in fact some 80% of Infineon’s microcontroller supply—comes from Asia where Taiwan’s TSMC dominates the market for contract chip manufacturing.

TSMC has invested $2.88 billion to expand capacity at a factory in China that produces automotive chips in order to “ease the global chip supply challenge.” The company also has committed to spending $100 billion over the next three years to “address the structural increase in the long-term demand.”

The Taiwanese firm’s dominant position has made it something of a kingmaker amid the shortage. On Wednesday U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the commerce department was “working hard to see if we can get the Taiwanese and TSMC [to] prioritize the needs of [U.S.] auto companies.”

German ministers requested Taiwanese officials help get German automakers to the front of the queue as early as January. The Taiwanese side responded by requesting Germany help the island source COVID-19 vaccines but the quid pro quo seemingly never materialized.

Both the U.S. and the EU have released plans to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing capacity limiting just slightly their reliance on Asia. The EU wants to double its chipmaking capacity by 2030 occupying 20% of the global market. Meanwhile U.S. President Joe Biden is pushing to secure $50 billion in government funding to revitalize the U.S.’s domestic industry. The extra capacity—some of which is being built by TSMC—won’t resolve the chip shortage soon but will help increase capacity in the long term.

“Across the industry there will be a huge ramp-up of production by the end of 2021” says Sanyam Chaurasia an analyst at Canalys. Some chipmakers he says started increasing capacity even last year but it takes roughly a year for new factories to come online.

“At the end of the day supply will meet demand and there will be equilibrium” says Chaurasia. “That’s how business is run.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9uaW50ZW5kby1zd2l0Y2gtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi10YXJnZXRzLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3Itc2hvcnRhZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nintendo May Not Meet Switch Production Targets Due To Semiconductor Shortage,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9uaW50ZW5kby1zd2l0Y2gtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi10YXJnZXRzLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3Itc2hvcnRhZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL3RlY2gvdGVjaC10cmVuZHMvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTMyODEzL3NlbWljb25kdWN0b3Itc2hvcnRhZ2Utc2Vlcy1jaGluYXMtY2FybWFrZXJzLWNoaXAtc3VwcGxpZXJzLWpvaW7SAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS90ZWNoL3RlY2gtdHJlbmRzL2FydGljbGUvMzEzMjgxMy9zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLXNob3J0YWdlLXNlZXMtY2hpbmFzLWNhcm1ha2Vycy1jaGlwLXN1cHBsaWVycy1qb2lu?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Semiconductor shortage sees China’s carmakers chip suppliers join forces,"The auto chip shortage was “emblematic of insufficient domestic [semiconductor] supply capacity” association deputy secretary Yao Jie said at a special seminar on the topic held Friday.

The chip supply shortage hurting the auto industry was one of the hottest topics for debate at the expo as delegates flagged proposals and ideas on how Chinese chip companies can help the country’s industry amid the widespread disruption felt by carmakers around the world.

The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers which represents the country’s car plants was an official sponsor of the three-day Global Semiconductor Industry Expo held in the Chinese mega city of Chongqing. It is the first time the carmaker’s group has sponsored the annual event.

The shortage of automotive chips is bringing China’s carmakers and semiconductor suppliers closer together than ever before with representatives from both industries discussing contingency plans on the sidelines of a chip industry event that ended Saturday.

“It is necessary to build a platform for better bridging supply and demand” Yao said adding that China could tap into existing inventories and production resources to try and ensure automakers had enough chips to continue production.

Unlike chips designed for the latest smartphones most electronics used in vehicles can generally be produced on mature technologies above 28-nanometre nodes that are not subject to trade sanctions from the US.

Changan Automobile a Chongqing-based state-owned carmaker with manufacturing joint ventures with Ford Mazda and Suzuki said it has widened its supplier pool to cope with the shortage.

“We have placed supply chain security very high on our agenda to ensure production” said Guang Penghui a senior engineer at Changan Auto’s smart car institute.

Guang said the company has tackled the chip shortage by merging tier-1 and tier-2 suppliers into one “vertical procurement platform” which means it will be able to source from a wider base of suppliers.

The Shenzhen-listed Changan sold more than 2 million cars in 2020 up 14 per cent from the year before.

The extent to which the shortage has hit Chinese carmakers is not known although there is growing anecdotal evidence pointing to a supply chain crunch in the country. China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has compiled a list of auto chip producers and buyers in China in an attempt to match supply with demand.

A representative from a Qingdao-based electric vehicle brand in discussing the situation with other delegates at the expo said the chip shortage took them by surprise as they had not expected it to be so serious.

International Data Corporation (IDC) said in a research note this week that the global semiconductor market would reach US$522 billion in 2021 up 12.5 per cent year on year buoyed by continued brisk growth in consumer automotive computing and 5G applications for chips.

“Supply constraints will continue through 2021” the note said. “While shortages initially occurred in automotive semiconductors the impact is being felt across the board in semiconductors manufactured at older technology nodes.”

Paramount Pictures has enjoyed a stellar reputation in the film industry due to its status as one of the oldest film studios in the world. Founded way back in 1912 the studio was built on the premise that cinema belongs to the working-class. Over the years it has produced masterpieces like Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho and Roman Polanski’s Rosemary’s Baby among many others.

“It’s an incredibly storied institution and one of the oldest studios. Some of the best movies ever made were made here. The chance to revive it is an exciting one” said Paramount’s CEO Jim Gianopulos. “It’s surprising it got so bumpy here for a couple of years because all the elements are in place. There are only six companies that comprise all the elements of a major studio and this is one of them. You want to see it achieve its full potential. There’s no reason why it shouldn’t be more successful than it’s been recently.”

He added “We have people money resources global distribution and the reach of almost four billion people that Viacom touches around the world. If you can’t make that work something’s not right. There is a great executive team here and a lot of very talented and dedicated people who want to win and who despite disappointments at the box office have a great sense of purpose direction and talent.”

On the 109th anniversary of its conception we take a look at 10 of the most successful Paramount Pictures releases of all time in order to understand its impact on popular culture.

The 10 most successful Paramount Pictures movies:

10. Transformers (Michael Bay – 2007)

Michael Bay’s Transformers is a well-known work in the sci-fi genre due to its popularity in the mainstream consciousness. It features a massive war between two extraterrestrial factions as they fight to gain control of the AllSpark. The film grossed $709709780 worldwide.

Bay said “I make my own movie I don’t have someone tell me what to do. I’ve always been inspired by Steven. I was not a Transformers fan before I signed on to this movie. I think I was two years older when the toys came out so I just discovered girls then instead of Optimus Prime. But I quickly became after I went to Hasbro where you heard about that Transformers school?

“I really thought ‘What the fuck am I going to Hasbro for Transformers school? I thought I was going to learn how to fold up robots but I met with the CEO and I went through the whole Transformer lore. I’ve been offered a lot of superhero movies before and nothing’s really appealed to me and in the room because I’ve been such a fan of Japanese Anime it just hit me that if I make this really real it could be something very new and different.”

9. Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted (Tom McGrath Eric Darnell Conrad Vernon – 2012)

The third film in the immensely popular Madagascar series the beloved animated work features the cohort of zoo animals who end up in Europe while trying to get back to New York. Even though it was probably not the best film in the franchise it was definitely the most successful one from a commercial perspective.

Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted grossed $746921274 worldwide and became the eighth-highest grossing film from 2012. The film also received several prestigious nominations including one for Best Animated Feature at the Critics’ Choice Movie Awards.

8. Shrek Forever After (Mike Mitchell – 2010)

The fourth instalment in the iconic Shrek franchise Mike Mitchell’s 2010 animated film portrays the titular character in a domesticated existence. In order to get out of his predicament Shrek signs a sinister contract with Rumpelstiltskin. Shrek Forever After became the fifth-highest grossing film of the year and made $752600867 worldwide.

While making the film the primary question that Mitchell grappled with was: “How do we give the audience what they know and love but at the same time give it a fresh take make it more beautiful?” He explained “We’ve taken on the bittersweet challenge of wrapping up the story of Shrek. We know fans would want to see how it ends.”

7. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Steven Spielberg – 2008)

Many fans of the Indiana Jones series consider Kingdom of the Crystal Skull to be the worst addition to its legacy. It features an ageing Jones (played by Harrison Ford) in the search for ancient civilisations and a mysterious crystal skull. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull ended up making $786636033 on a global scale.

“I’m very happy with the movie. I always have been” the director admitted. “I sympathise with people who didn’t like the MacGuffin because I never liked the MacGuffin. George [Lucas] and I had big arguments about the MacGuffin. I didn’t want these things to be either aliens or inter-dimensional beings. But I am loyal to my best friend.

“When he writes a story he believes in – even if I don’t believe in it – I’m going to shoot the movie the way George envisaged it. I’ll add my own touches I’ll bring my own cast in I’ll shoot the way I want to shoot it but I will always defer to George as the storyteller of the Indy series. I will never fight him on that.”

6. Mission: Impossible – Fallout (Christopher McQuarrie – 2018)

Starring Tom Cruise as the famous Ethan Hunt this 2018 spy thriller presents a hunt for plutonium as terrorists threaten to blow three cities. The wildly successful film made $220.2 million in North America alone and ended up with a total gross of $791.1 million worldwide.

“Mission is always a little bit of an underdog. This franchise doesn’t have the wind under its wings that something like Bond does. We always feel like we have something to prove. We never take that success for granted” the director said. “There are a lot of franchises that are always looking to top themselves or take their movies to the next level but the secret to our success is we aren’t trying to top ourselves.”

5. Shrek the Third (Chris Miller – 2007)

Chris Miller’s 2007 animated film has to be one of the most commercially successful directorial debuts of all time. The third addition to the Shrek series this version reveals Shrek’s doubts as he is hesitant to take the reigns of the kingdom as a ruler. The film grossed $813367380 worldwide.

“The way we look at the series is just sort of as a continuous story” Miller elaborated. “We didn’t want to just sort of title it like it was just a sequel. [We wanted] something to make it stand on its own give it its own personality and really try to treat it as a chapter in Shrek’s life. I quite like the name because there were other iterations of it that just felt like the title for any sequel.”

4. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Michael Bay – 2009)

Starring Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky Revenge of the Fallen continues the story of its predecessor two years after the events of the first film. Bay faced a lot of problems during this particular production especially his team going on strike. However Revenge of the Fallen became a commercial success and earned $836303693 at the worldwide Box Office.

Bay said: “On the second movie we got burned. We had a writers strike we had to agree on a story in three weeks and then we knew they were going on strike. It was a fucked scenario all the way around it wasn’t fair to the writer it wasn’t fair to me it wasn’t fair to anybody. It was still an entertaining movie but I think we failed on certain aspects.”

3. Transformers: Age of Extinction (Michael Bay – 2014)

Michael Bay’s Transformers series is undoubtedly one of the highest-grossing film franchises. Age of Extinction is just another example of the influence of Transformers on popular culture even though the film was poorly received by critics and considered to be sub-par. Age of Extinction made $1104054072 worldwide.

While talking about the series Michal Bay commented: “Movie franchises have to grow up a little bit. You start off kind of like fun trying to figure out what it was you know what I’m saying? That kind of setup. But I like it a little bit more grounded. Still fun but grounded.”

2. Transformers: Dark of the Moon (Michael Bay – 2011)

The most financially successful instalment in the Transformers series Dark of the Moon continues the war between the Autobots and Decepticons as they engage in a massive power struggle. The film earned Oscar bids for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Editing among others. Dark of the Moon ended up with a worldwide gross of $1.12 billion.

“We tried to learn from the second movie” the filmmaker admitted. “What we did with this movie is I think we have a much better script and we got back to basics. I think there’s some really cool action on this movie there’s some very cool conspiracy there’s great robot stuff in this that people were missing in the second one you’ve got great robot conflict.”

1. Titanic (James Cameron – 1997)

It’s extremely impressive that Titanic has retained its status as the highest-grossing Paramount production both in North America as well as worldwide even after all these years. James Cameron’s famous romantic drama sits at the top of the list with a monumental worldwide gross of $2.18 billion.

Cameron reflected “I had dark hours on Titanic as dire as Piranha II. We missed the iceberg by that much. But I’m at my best when I’m neck-deep in ice water trying to work out how we’re going to keep the lights turned on when the water hits the bulbs.”

Adding “Titanic was conceived as a love story. If I could have done it without one effect I would’ve been happy. It was definitely a goal to integrate a very personal emotional style with spectacle – and try to make that not be chocolate syrup on a cheeseburger you know. The cathartic experience is what made the film work.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN5ZnkuY29tL3N5Znktd2lyZS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWdvZHppbGxhLWtvbmctbmVhcnMtMTAwLW1pbGxpb24tbm9ydGgtYW1lcmljYdIBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN5ZnkuY29tL3N5Znktd2lyZS9ib3gtb2ZmaWNlLWdvZHppbGxhLWtvbmctbmVhcnMtMTAwLW1pbGxpb24tbm9ydGgtYW1lcmljYT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mother's Day Box office: Godzilla vs. Kong nears $100 million in North America; Mortal Kombat hits $72 million globally,"The domestic box office continues to bounce back amid the COVID-19 pandemic as Godzilla vs. Kong surpassed $92 million this weekend. It's a very promising milestone for upcoming tentpoles like Paramount's A Quiet Place Part II (May 28) Marvel Studios' Black Widow (July 9) and Universal's F9 (June 25).

Globally the monster mash has made a little over $422 million prompting Warner Bros. to kick off development on a fifth MonsterVerse project with GvK director Adam Wingard at the helm. Variety points out that the fourth colossal entry in the shared monster universe ""surpassed revenues for its predecessor the poorly reviewed mega-budgeted Godzilla: King of the Monsters. That film which was released in 2019 tapped out with $386 million.""

Despite Hollywood backlash (coming from high-profile directors like Christopher Nolan and Denis Villeneuve) over its unprecedented strategy of streaming/theatrical rollouts for all of its 2021 pictures WB seems to be getting the last laugh with its kaiju face-off which is now the highest-grossing movie of the entire health crisis. After more than a year of exhibitor malaise newly-vaccinated audiences are proving that the communal theatergoing experience isn't as dead as previously suspected.

Now in its third frame Warner Bros.' Mortal Kombat slipped to third place with $2.3 million in domestic sales which boosted its North American total to $37.8 million. On a global scale the video game adaptation has finished off $72 million so far (it's also available to stream on HBO Max until the end of the month). Demon Slayer remained above Mortal Kombat with $3 million but fell to second losing out on the top spot to Guy Ritchie's crime action-thriller Wrath of Man. To date Demon Slayer has made $39 million domestically and over $435 million worldwide (the most lucrative anime feature in history).

David Oyelowo's directorial debut The Water Man opened this weekend with $183000 from 311 domestic screens. Written by Emma Needell the fantasy film centers on a young boy (Lonnie Chavis) who sets out to find a mythical figure in an effort to cure his ailing mother (Rosario Dawson). Disney's Raya and the Last Dragon added $1.8 million to its North American haul bringing its at-home box office to $43.8 million. Globally the animated feature has crossed $105 million.

Other genre holdovers at the domestic box office include: Chaos Walking ($13.2 million) Voyagers ($3.1 million) and In the Earth ($1.1 million). Internationally two Sony releases — The Unholy and Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway — hit $10 million and $17.9 million respectively.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhZ2xpdHouY29tL3Nob2NraW5nLXJldmVsYXRpb24tb2Ytc2FtYW50aGEtbmFnYS1jaGFpdGFueWEtbmV0d29ydGgtLW5ld3MtMjg2MTUy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shocking Revelation of Samantha - Naga Chaitanya Networth! - News,"Naga Chaitanya & Samantha Ruth Prabhu one of the most popular star couples in South Indian cinema's net worth has been revealed and it is indeed shocking!

PH,Parker Hannifin,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA1LzA5L3J1c3NpYS1tYXktYWJhbmRvbi10aGUtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1zcGFjZS1zdGF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russia May Abandon the International Space Station in 2025: What Happens Next?,"ISS may soon be obsolete -- but will we even miss it?

The announcement blazed across the headlines of The Moscow Times on April 19: ""Russia to Quit Int'l Space Station in 2025 ""!

Citing ""a senior government official"" (Vice Prime Minister Yury Borisov) MT reported that Russia will soon officially inform the United States and its other space partners of its withdrawal from the International Space Station (ISS) effective in 2025 and its plans to ""deploy a next-generation national orbital service station"" of its own instead.

Crucially ""withdrawing"" from the ISS isn't just a turn of phrase. Russia's plan it appears is to physically detach the ISS modules that Russia owns from the station. And yet at last report NASA was thinking that the ISS might continue in service through 2030.

What now?

Some commentators have suggested that the ISS could not function without the Russian modules (which importantly include the station's main propulsion module which is used both to maintain a stable orbit and to maneuver around threatening pieces of orbital debris when they come too close). But others believe the ISS could limp along without the Russian parts which in any case could be replaced with new modules that we could send up.

Indeed it's fortuitous that at the same time the (non-Russian) ISS partners are faced with a dilemma about how to fit the station with a new set of engines multiple companies are developing fleets of ""space tugs"" for use as ad hoc engines for satellites lacking propulsion. To date Northrop Grumman (NOC -0.45%) has used two large MEV spacecraft to serve as the engines on defunct Intelsat satellites. Maxar Technologies (MAXR) is working on a large space tug of its own. And on a smaller scale space SPACs Stable Road Acquisition (SRAC) and Vector Acquisition (VACQ) are also developing space tugs for smaller satellites.

Theoretically at least any of these companies might be recruited into a NASA effort to fit out the ISS with a new propulsion module to replace any Russian parts that go missing in 2025. In short while a Russian exit from the ISS would pose a problem it's not an insurmountable problem for America's space industry -- especially given four years (or more -- Russia only plans to begin exiting the ISS in 2025) to figure out a fix.

What next?

Perhaps the bigger question for investors to consider though is this: Even assuming the ISS can continue limping along after a Russian exit the station is getting a bit long in the tooth. Construction of the ISS began in 1998 and the station was originally designed for a 15-year lifespan. (Put down your pencils. The ISS should have been retired in 2013.)

Obviously that didn't happen but at some point the ISS probably will go away entirely. What happens then?

Well we've already discussed one part of the puzzle: Russia. If and when Russia retires from the ISS consortium it plans to begin work on a new Russian-owned station to replace it. Dubbed ""ROSS"" -- the Russian Orbital Service Station -- work on this station is expected to begin in 2025 and cost the Russian state about $6 billion to complete.

That's quite a discount from the price tag on the ISS by the way which is estimated to have cost upwards of $100 billion to assemble. Even if the ROSS turns out to be a much smaller station than the ISS this drastically lower price tag suggests that the price of space launch has fallen dramatically over the last 20-odd years.

Russia's new space station will be designed as both a scientific and a production platform enabling manufacturing in space -- and also in-orbit satellite repair and refueling. It may even evolve into a transportation hub hosting a fleet of Russia's own space tugs.

Russia has also said it will cooperate with China to build a joint Sino-Russian space station that would orbit the moon -- and that brings us to our second point. In addition to its joint venture with Russia China has already begun building an Earth-orbiting space station of its own! Centered on the Tianhe module launched from last week China's new 66-ton ""Tiangong"" space station is expected to take another 10 launches to complete to be operational by 2022 and to continue in operation for 10 years thereafter.

And even that's not all. In addition to a still-functioning ISS a Russian ROSS and a Chinese Tiangong American private company Axiom Space won permission from NASA last year to attach a new habitation module to the ISS -- a module that the company intends to later separate from the ISS to form the basis of the world's first privately owned and operated space station.

Long story short the ISS's days may be numbered or it may continue in operation for even longer than it already has. With it or without it though orbit is about to get a whole lot more crowded. The race to populate Earth orbit with new space stations has begun.",,,,,,,,,,,,

""Tự lập không thừa kế"" và 5 bài học cơ bản về kinh doanh

Trong cuốn sách đầu tay đầy tâm huyết ""Tự lập không thừa kế"" tác giả Golisano chia sẻ những kinh nghiệm kinh doanh đắt giá của chính bản thân trong hơn 50 năm qua. Không lý thuyết rườm rà ông luôn đi trực tiếp vào các vấn đề một cách thực dụng. Và đây chính là giá trị của cuốn sách.

Đưa độc giả đi qua những gì chính bản thân đã trải nghiệm ông nhấn mạnh những gì không được quên những gì chủ doanh nghiệp chịu trách nhiệm và tầm quan trọng của việc hiểu mọi khía cạnh của doanh nghiệp. Dưới đây là 5 bài học cơ bản về kinh doanh mà tác giả Tom Golisano cho rằng mọi doanh nhân cần biết để thành công.

● Kế hoạch kinh doanh: Thật dễ dàng để niềm đam mê che lấp sự phán xét của bạn. ""Nhiều cuốn sách kinh doanh đưa ra những khẩu hiệu hoang đường: 'Hãy theo đuổi đam mê của bạn' hoặc 'Hãy vững tin và bạn sẽ đạt được thành công.' Kiểu suy nghĩ này có thể khiến bạn gặp nguy hiểm. Điều quan trọng nhất khi lập kế hoạch kinh doanh là kế hoạch của bạn phải có các dữ kiện và số liệu thống kê chính xác… Sau khi nghe ai đó đề xuất bất cứ cơ hội kinh doanh nào tôi đều có thể phác thảo một kế hoạch chi tiết để biến nó thành tiền tất cả chỉ vỏn vẹn trên một trang giấy. Tôi tính toán chi phí vận hành và tìm hiểu xem cần bao nhiêu khách hàng để hòa vốn. Cần phải kiếm đủ tiền để tồn tại trước khi tính đến các kế hoạch cao xa khác. Theo nhiều nghĩa kinh doanh thật ra chỉ thế. Tất cả các vấn đề khác không phải là điều cốt lõi. Và trong giai đoạn đầu họ (doanh nhân/ người khởi nghiệp) phải cực kỳ trung thực với bản thân cũng như những người mà họ kêu gọi đầu tư tài chính"".

● Tài chính: ""Nếu bạn không hiểu các báo cáo tài chính bạn đang điều hành doanh nghiệp của mình một cách mù quáng. Tôi nghĩ rằng nhiều doanh nhân gặp rắc rối đơn giản vì họ không hiểu báo cáo tài chính của mình trong đó bảng cân đối kế toán và báo cáo lãi lỗ là quan trọng nhất. Bất kỳ doanh nhân nào không hiểu báo cáo tài chính đều gặp nguy hiểm lớn"".

● Dòng tiền: ""Nếu doanh nghiệp của bạn thiếu tiền mặt nơi đầu tiên cần xem xét là năng suất bán hàng của bạn. Các vấn đề về dòng tiền là kết quả trực tiếp của việc không tạo ra đủ doanh thu thông qua bán hàng. Sai lầm lớn nhất của các doanh nhân là có xu hướng đánh giá quá cao khả năng bán sản phẩm hoặc dịch vụ của họ"".

● Kiến thức Kinh doanh: ""Thông thường các doanh nhân không chỉ có khoảng cách lớn về kiến thức và kinh nghiệm kinh doanh; mà còn hoàn toàn mù tịt về những khiếm khuyết của họ. Nếu bạn muốn cải thiện cơ hội thành công hãy trung thực với bản thân và nhận ra những điểm yếu trong kiến thức và sự nhạy bén trong kinh doanh của bạn đồng thời tìm kiếm sự trợ giúp từ người cố vấn hoặc tham gia các khóa học để tìm hiểu những điều bạn cần biết. Một con ngựa đua thuần chủng cho dù có tốt đến đâu cũng không thể chiến thắng trong các cuộc đua nếu nó bị cưỡi bởi một tay đua kém cỏi. Điều tương tự cũng đúng với một doanh nghiệp"".

● Gia đình: ""Một điều hối tiếc chung của nhiều doanh nhân là không dành đủ thời gian cho gia đình như lẽ ra phải thế. Đây là một khó khăn bởi vì bạn phải làm việc chăm chỉ để xây dựng công ty để bạn có thể đảm bảo một mức sống tốt hơn cho vợ/chồng và con cái của bạn. Tuy nhiên tôi rất tiếc vì đã không tìm được sự cân bằng tốt hơn. Cân bằng giữa công việc và cuộc sống đã trở thành một điều quan trọng trong kinh doanh trong những năm gần đây và tôi không chắc mình đủ tiêu chuẩn để đưa ra lời khuyên về chủ đề này.

Доход Маска за год в несколько раз превысил сумму в 211 млн долларов полученную в 2020 году генеральным директором Paycom Чадом Ричисоном (Chad Richison) который возглавлял большинство списков самых высокооплачиваемых лидеров компаний 2020 года.

В прошлом году Маск получил около 11 миллиардов долларов в Tesla включая различные бонусы которые основывались на достижении компанией различных этапов рыночной капитализации. В целом пакет заработной платы дает Маску право купить 1012 миллиона акций Tesla по скорректированной цене в 70 долларов за штуку. В настоящее время их рыночная стоимость превышает 670 долларов за единицу. Компенсационный пакет разделен на 12 траншей каждый из которых может быть разблокирован только тогда когда Tesla достигнет определенных этапов в своей деятельности.

Первые четыре транша опционной премии Маск выиграл в 2020 году когда Tesla достигла высокой рыночной капитализации и акции компании выросли в семь раз. Благодаря этому состояние Маска увеличилось в разы. По состоянию на 1 мая генеральный директор Tesla занимал второе место в списке самых богатых людей на планете с капиталом 182 млрд долларов. Сейчас его состояние оценивается в 184 млрд долларов а у основателя Amazon и Blue Origin Джеффа Безоса (Jeff Bezos) — 192 млрд долларов.

Каждый из опционов дает Маску право приобрести 84 миллиона акций Tesla. По оценкам Forbes в прошлом году он получил в общей сложности 133 миллиарда долларов в виде выплаты опционов. Реализация опционов обойдется Маску в 236 миллиарда долларов. Без учета этих затрат по оценке Forbes эти опционы увеличили состояние Маска на 11 миллиардов долларов.

Маск должен владеть предоставленными ему акциями Tesla в течение пяти лет. Это может быть одной из причин по которым он не фигурирует в списках самых высокооплачиваемых руководителей. На сегодняшний день Маск получил шесть траншей опционных выплат на сумму около 339 миллиарда долларов. Весь компенсационный пакет принесет генеральному директору Tesla 679 миллиарда долларов.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The issue of fake product reviews where sellers seek to gain an edge over competitors by boosting their rankings has been a persistent one on the marketplace that Amazon has been battling.

SafetyDetectives said the open ElasticSearch server contained more than 134 million messages between Amazon vendors and customers willing to provide fake reviews in exchange for free product. The leak was discovered on March 1 and monitored until the server believed to be in China and not associated with participants in the scam was secured on March 6.

According to SafetyDetectives the scam worked by having 3P sellers send potential reviewers a list of products for which they were seeking five-star reviews. The reviewers would then buy the product and post the review. Once it was verified by the seller who was sent a link to the reviewer’s Amazon profile they would be reimbursed for the purchase through PayPal not through the Amazon platform.

“(Processing payment through PayPal) makes the five-star review look legitimate so as not to arouse suspicion from Amazon moderators” SafetyDetectives noted in a blog post.

The 13 million-plus records more than 7GB of data were exposed when the server “was left open without any password protection or encryption” the group said. This included personal data of both the sellers and the reviewers such as email addresses Whatsapp and Telegram phone numbers.

“Contact details were given to the potential fake review providers to continue communications outside of the services where these leaked interactions had taken place” the group said. As many as 250000 may be involved in the fake review scam.

Leaked data included information that could be used to personally identify individuals including Amazon accounts and profiles PayPal account details email addresses and user names that often contained first and last names.

Reviewers were given specific criteria to follow in order to avoid the scrutiny of Amazon’s fraud detection by making the reviews appear legitimate. This included waiting a few days before publishing a review making the reviews longer and providing details to be included in them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmNoZXN0ZXJldmVuaW5nbmV3cy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLW5ld3MvdXJnZW50LXBheXBhbC13YXJuaW5nLWlzc3VlZC1zaG9wcGVycy0yMDU0ODUwMdIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmNoZXN0ZXJldmVuaW5nbmV3cy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLW5ld3MvdXJnZW50LXBheXBhbC13YXJuaW5nLWlzc3VlZC1zaG9wcGVycy0yMDU0ODUwMS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Urgent warning issued to anyone with a PayPal account,"Something went wrong please try again later.

A fresh warning has been issued to anybody who has a PayPal account - even if they don't use it much.

An ITV documentary Tonight shed light on the spate of scams and rise of vile fraudsters attempting to swindle unwitting victims across the country.

It aired on Thursday evening at 7.30pm on ITV1 BirminghamLive reports.

They're also passing themselves off as workers from PayPal according to warnings.

But police forces are still urging people to exercise caution and stay vigilant amid a worrying rise in fraudulent text messages and emails.

A Midland Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) Sam Doninton said: ""I have had a large number of residents mention scams and/or spam texts that they have been receiving as a real problem.""

Dojo has compiled data which may help people avoid falling victim to text scams.

The data looked at the number of Google searches for well-known text scams and discovered how these have become more prevalent over the past couple of months.

Hermes came out on top with the largest search increase with 880 searches for 'Hermes scam text' in March up from 120 in February.

Scammers have been asking potential victims to pay a shipping fee to receive their package.

As there have been a growing number of online shopping for their daily goods and clothes due to Covid it seems like an obvious choice for scammers.

Second on the list is the British postal service Royal Mail with an incredible 133k people searching for 'Royal Mail scam text' in March alone.

This delivery service has seen a massive search increase of 610 per cent in the last month with many scammers trying to impersonate the company to retrieve the details of unsuspecting customers.

The Royal Mail scam tells a similar story to Hermes with the scammers asking people to pay a shipping fee before their package is delivered.

The Royal Mail website states that similar to telephone email and online scams there are also scams that can be sent via the post as well.

Royal Mail urges anyone who believes they may be victim to a scam to avoid clicking any links in communication you're not sure about.

It has listed common scams on its website here and anyone who receives suspicious correspondence is urged to complete this online form.

As well as delivery companies the DVLA has also been targeted by scammers.

In the past month searches for 'DVLA text scam' have shot up from 450 searches in February to 2150 searches in March.

This scam seems to see fraudsters impersonating the DVLA to offer the victim a vehicle tax refund directing unsuspecting people to an online page where they're tricked into inserting their details.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h6aW0uY28uencvMjAyMS8wNS9wYXlwYWwtY29uZmlybXMtbWVyY2hhbnQtd2FsbGV0cy1mb3ItemltLWJ1dC13aXRoZHJhd2Fscy1hcmUtc3RpbGwtY29tcGxpY2F0ZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PayPal confirms merchant wallets for Zim but withdrawals are still complicated,"So a couple of days ago we learned that if you open a PayPal merchant wallet in Zim you can send and more importantly receive money via PayPal. This is massive news for e-commerce in Zimbabwe because it opens up the avenues for forex payments that don’t need elaborate integrations at the entry-level.

What was missing in all of this was an official confirmation from PayPal to rubber stamp this. And we now have that:

“Customers in Zimbabwe are now able to open business accounts. It is a permanent feature but if anything changes we’ll make sure to inform anyone impacted” PayPal Support

The confirmation was courtesy of Twitter user @Hypeitnow who left a comment on one of our posts.

With all of that out of the way there are two important questions that need to be answered:

If you open an account and transact can you withdraw money out of your PayPal merchant wallet? What is the situation with the API for businesses that want a PayPal integration?

Linking a card is the best you can do right now..

The one thing that Zimbos have been all too familiar with when it comes to PayPal (besides being unable to receive money) is that you couldn’t withdraw money from a personal account.

Once the money was in your PayPal walley it couldn’t be used for anything else besides payments through the wallet. Or if you were lucky you could find someone who wanted a Paypal transfer in exchange for cash.

Well unfortunately it looks like nothing much has changed in this respect. You cannot withdraw your money once it’s in your PayPal merchant wallet unless you have a US Account. In all of our trials and tests there is only the option for linking a US-based account to your PayPal wallet.

However if you for some reason have a US account you are in luck because it should be a whole lot easier for you to get your money out of your merchant wallet. For regular Zimbos all you can do at the moment is link a debit card which will most commonly be a prepaid USD card.

It doesn’t look like you can withdraw money into this card from your PayPal however because in all the attempts we tried it gives us a beneath the limit error. So… yeah…

If you are one of the lucky few with a US account and you are withdrawing out of your PayPal wallet. Here are few things that you might need to take note of.

Your money might not reflect in your bank account because it takes 5-7 business days for it to clear (excluding weekends).

Common errors that occur with withdrawals include entering the wrong account number or your bank being unable to accept electronic funds transfers. You should check with your bank to make sure that they can accept EFTs.

Is PayPal still viable even though there are no withdrawals for Zim merchant wallets?

Most definitely! This opens up a whole new avenue for you and your customers both existing and potential. The unfortunate part is the money you generate has to be used through PayPal or you can take the long route and Xoom the money to yourself and collect at a ZB Bank.

The Xoom remittance option isn’t going to be for everyone because of the charges. But the hope is that if more businesses start accepting payments via PayPal it will force PayPal to make it easier to withdraw money for Zimbabwean businesses.

The Zim government and RBZ willing of course

PayPal merchant wallets could also help with not overpaying or buying something you don’t want because the establishment doesn’t have change. I have been frustrated every time I see something in Zimbabwe priced at US$2.50 when no one in Zimbabwe has ever used a 50 US cent coin.

What about the API?

In our conversation with PayPal support the operator highlighted that the API is up and running for Zim merchant wallet. This means if you want to integrate your store all you need to do is to have this get the PayPal API and you can find the instructions to do that are in the link here.

Global packaged goods companies sustained solid growth during the first quarter of 2021 rising 4.5% organically. Like other companies in other industries all of them are facing input cost inflation to a meaningful degree and are likely to raise prices for consumers. But as the CEO of Kellogg’s reminded everyone on their earnings call this week marketers can earn price increases by building stronger brands.

Television advertising has been one of the most important vehicles used to build brands; however change is occurring rapidly as illustrated by this week’s results from Roku and other data related to declining conventional pay-TV subscriptions. Whatever vehicles marketers choose to use what matters is that they continue to invest in their brands to better position themselves to earn the price increases they will increasingly need.

—–

Virtually all packaged goods companies have now reported their first quarter 2021 results and input cost inflation remains a key trend. Costs will inevitably be passed along to consumers as the year progresses. Addressing how to deal with this phenomenon on its earnings call this week Kellogg’s CEO said “we have to earn that price in the marketplace through investing in our brands (and) through innovating.” It may seem paradoxical to suggest incurring more cost in order to offset other costs and yet it certainly can work. In an article from Kantar published last year titled “Why pricing power is a brand’s greatest asset” they stated “to justify paying more for a brand people must feel that they are getting something from buying that brand that they cannot get elsewhere. In other words they have to perceive it as different in some way…Brands that command a higher price point in their category are typically seen as meaningful and different.” While the primary drivers of growth for advertising this year and beyond are smaller businesses app developers and others who will not have particularly strong brands in the conventional sense for larger traditional marketers to invest more heavily in their brands to justify the higher prices they plan to seek would be a source of upside growth for the media industry.

In addition to Kellogg’s we have compiled results from the largest publicly listed packaged goods segments at Nestle P&G Unilever Pepsico Coca-Cola L’Oreal Mondelez Kraft Heinz Danone Reckitt Colgate General Mills Kimberly-Clark J&J Henkel Hershey and Clorox. On a combined basis this group of global packaged goods companies grew 4.5% on an organic basis during the first quarter of 2021. This followed on what was a relatively strong 2020 all things considered of 3.6% organic growth. The growth rate was also notable as the sector faced relatively difficult comparables against the early phases of the pandemic last year which led to a similar 4.6% growth rate in 1Q20). North American growth was only slightly softer vs. other markets but then the year-ago period was slightly stronger in North America vs. the rest of the world last year. On a two-year basis growth rates were similar.

Looking at individual groups of business segments by their core products food businesses grew organically by 5.2% in 1Q21 ahead of the 4.0% growth rate posted in each of the full year 2020 and 1Q20. Beverages were still relatively soft and were close to flat similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter but well ahead of the year’s average. Out-of-home consumption serves as a significant drag for these companies. Petcare was up 8.9% sustaining the rapid growth we have seen for an extended period of time (above mid-single digits since the beginning of 2019). Personal care businesses were also relatively soft growing by 1.1% or below the pace of growth observed in the fourth quarter and full-year 2020 levels both because of pantry loading during the first quarter of 2020 but also because consumers are still not consuming all personal care products as they used to. Despite similar pantry loading trends for home care products growth is still elevated at high single-digit levels with a gain of 8.0% on our calculations.

Unsurprisingly e-commerce continues to grow rapidly: a subset of companies among this group that disclosed e-commerce growth or share of revenue attributable to e-commerce indicates that growth was around 48% in the first quarter only slightly slower than full-year 2020’s 55% pace of expansion. E-commerce now accounts for around 14% of total revenue up from 10% in the year-ago quarter and 8% in the calendar year 2019. Of course some segments remain relatively less dependent than others as food-centric marketers generally have been able to rely on retailers staying open over the course of the past years while others whose goods primarily sold through “non-essential” channels were more dependent on investing in direct-to-consumer or other e-commerce based sales channels.

The week was also punctuated by reporting from Roku which posted its results for the quarter as well. Roku’s results showed 35% more active accounts and 49% more time spent on the platform which in total resulted in 18.3 billion hours of streaming content (vs. 12.3 billion in the year-ago quarter). Per account we can calculate a 9% increase in streaming hours year-over-year.

For reference total TV consumption in the US amounted to 102 billion household viewing hours in the most recent quarter with 22.4 billion hours originating from internet-connected devices according to Nielsen. Year-over-year household growth in internet-connected device-based consumption amounted to 15% because of the very difficult comparable with last year’s first quarter.

We are mindful that Roku has a relatively small but growing international presence which will account for a share of the 18.3 billion hours. The company claims that now more than one in three smart TVs sold in Canada feature Roku and that it has the #2 operating system for Smart TVs sold in Mexico. =

Growth in Roku accounts coincides with (and probably partially contributes to) the decline in pay-TV subscriptions as well. On our calculations during the first quarter of 2021 traditional satellite and cable services and incremental vMVPD (virtual MVPDs or internet-based pay-TV distributors) households tracked by Nielsen declined by approximately 4% on a combined basis during this period. This compares with a decline that ran below 4% in each quarter of 2020. In total Nielsen estimates that there are now 87 million households or 72% of the country’s total with pay-TV services now. 12% of total households (a subset of the 72% figure) are solely served by vMVPDs well below the historic peaks exceeding 90% as recently as 2013. Similar trends are occurring in many other markets around the world albeit from lower levels of peak pay-TV penetration: this past week Liberty Global also reported results and while pay-TV is growing in some newer markets such as Poland it is declining in other more valuable ones such as the UK where Roku among others are investing for their future growth.

All of these overlapping trends contribute to the increased availability of addressable and connected TV inventory but also to the increased scarcity of traditional linear television inventory. Inflationary conditions for like-for-like units of inventory inevitably will follow. Fortunately for marketers and media owners television remains a medium that is a key contributor to brand-building efforts although its ongoing erosion means that marketers need to continually invest in finding ways to build their brands without relying as much on television in the future as they did in the past. Whatever vehicles marketers choose to use what matters is that they continue to invest in their brands so that they can be better positioned to earn the prices they plan to seek from consumers in the years ahead.

In the presence of Mr. Malik Amin Aslam Prime Minister’s special assistant on Climate Change unveiled a first of its kind Reverse Vending Machine (RVM) for plastics at the Jinnah Super Market Islamabad.

The machine makes it convenient and rewarding for people to recycle on the go plastic bottles of any brand can used in the machine.

The RVM itself is like a vending machine in reverse. Consumers press the start button on a touch screen and the RVM opens up a slot to receive the plastic bottle.

Once deposited the RVM compresses the PET so that it is ready for the next steps of recycling.

The RVM is part of the company’s larger strategy and intent to take meaningful steps towards tackling the issue of plastic waste.

Earlier this year PepsiCo announced the country’s largest plastics collection and recycling project under the Prime Minister’s Clean Green Pakistan program.

Making steady progress towards this goal the company announced more than doubling its existing targets for plastic collection and recycling.

PepsiCo Pakistan will scale up its existing 4750 tons plastics collection program by adding another 5500 tons making a total of 10250 tons of plastics to be collected and recycled in 2021.

The program is implemented by PepsiCo’s partner Green Earth Recycling and its progress is being monitored by WWF-Pakistan.

Both these important announcements come in the buildup to the world environment day which is being proudly hosted by Pakistan this year.

Prime Minister’s special assistant on Climate Change Mr. Malik Amin Aslam commented ‘’ All of us will have to work together to truly address the plastic issue.

EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said her office has approved a contract for a guaranteed 900 million doses with the same amount of doses as a future option.

The new contract which has the unanimous backing of the 27 EU member nations will entail not only the production of the vaccines but also making sure that all the essential components are sourced from the EU.

The European Commission currently has a portfolio of 2.6 billion doses from half a dozen companies. Pfizer-BioNTech had an initial contract of 600 million doses with the EU.

Saturday’s announcement also underscores the confidence the EU has shown in the technology behind the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine which is different from how the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine works.

“But of course we will also explore other contracts for example based on other technologies like the protein-based technologies. The key point is to keep our options open” von der Leyen said at an EU summit in Portugal.

The active ingredient in the Pfizer-BioNTech shot is messenger RNA or mRNA which contains the instructions for human cells to construct a harmless piece of the coronavirus called the spike protein. The human immune system recognizes the spike protein as foreign allowing it to mount a response against the virus upon infection.

The announcement of the huge contract extension comes as the EU is looking for ways to meet the challenges of providing the necessary booster shots to people who have already receive a vaccine dose expanding vaccination drives to include children and teenagers and the emergence of possible new virus variants.

The size of the contract – 1.8 billion doses for a bloc of 450 million residents – will provide for a lot of options von der Leyen said.

“That includes the possibility for the member states to donate or resell doses” at a lower price to help nations in the immediate neighborhood or beyond she said..

America’s Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech have already said that they would provide the EU with an extra 50 million doses in the 2nd quarter of this year making up for faltering deliveries of AstraZeneca.

In contrast to the oft-criticized Anglo-Swedish AstraZeneca von der Leyen has said that Pfizer-BioNTech is a reliable partner that delivers on its commitments.

Two weeks ago the EU launched legal proceedings against AstraZeneca for failing to respect the terms of its contract with the 27-nation bloc.

The AstraZeneca vaccine had been central to Europe’s immunization campaign and a linchpin in the global strategy to get vaccines to poorer countries. But the slow pace of deliveries has frustrated the Europeans and they have held the company responsible for partly delaying their vaccine rollout.

So far von der Leyen said the EU has made some 200 million doses available to its 450 million residents while almost as many have been exported from the bloc.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSGVhbHRoL2Zsb3JpZGEtcmVwb3J0cy0xMDAwMC1jb3ZpZC0xOS12YXJpYW50LWNhc2VzLXN1cmdlL3N0b3J5P2lkPTc3NTUzMTAw0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvSGVhbHRoL2Zsb3JpZGEtcmVwb3J0cy0xMDAwMC1jb3ZpZC0xOS12YXJpYW50LWNhc2VzLXN1cmdlL3N0b3J5P2lkPTc3NTUzMTAw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida reports more than 10000 COVID-19 variant cases surge after spring break,"243 have been hospitalized with variants and 67 have died.

Variant COVID-19 infections skyrocketed following spring break in Florida and there have been more than 10000 variant cases reported throughout the state the South Florida Sun Sentinel reported based on data from the Florida Department of Health.

A total of 753 variant cases from three strains -- the B.1.1.7 the P.1 and the B. 1.3.5.1. -- were reported on March 14 according to variant infection data shared with ABC News. The Florida Department of Health does not disclose variant cases on its public dashboard.

That number swelled to 5177 cases from five types of variants on April 15. Just two weeks later the number of variant infections exploded to 9248 on April 27 according to local ABC affiliate  WFTV.

The surge falls in line with mid-March into April spring break celebrations when college students and vacationers flock to the sunshine state.

Florida is home to the most variant COVID-19 cases in the country. State health officials reported more than 11800 cases of COVID-19 variants on Wednesday according to the Sun Sentinel.

In total variants have led to the hospitalization of 243 residents and the death of 67 people in Florida the Sun Sentinel reported.

Only 1% of all COVID-19 cases in Florida undergo testing to study their genetic coding meaning the number of variant infections is likely much higher than reported.

The data regarding variants was first released Monday hours after Gov. Ron DeSantis announced the lift of all local COVID-19 restrictions.

The Florida Department of Health released the data as a part of a legal settlement with the Orlando Sentinel after the paper sued in March to obtain a county breakdown of variant cases. A judge ended up agreeing with the paper’s claim that the data was vital “to understand how the virus continues to spread and affect Floridians.”

As vaccinations across the country slow there are concerns over the threat of highly transmissible variants. In Florida the B.1.1.7. variant which first emerged in the United Kingdom in December makes up the highest number of variant cases. There are also several reports of the South African and Brazilian variants.

As of May 1 Miami-Dade County led the state with 2279 variant cases followed by Broward County with 1950 variant cases the Sun Sentinel reported.

While variants seem to be gaining traction overall COVID-19 cases in the Sunshine State are slowing. Health officials reported a 4.67% COVID-19 positivity rate on Friday -- the second day in a row that it has dipped below 5% per state data.

Now doctors are warning the public to stay vigilant and get vaccinated to prevent cases from going back up.

Dr. Bernard Ashby a Miami-based cardiologist who has worked in the front lines of the pandemic is warning of the dangers of the variants especially in populous areas.

""If you look at the county breakdown Miami-Dade leads the state in the variants followed by Broward County. And we've led in infections rates in general"" Ashby told ABC News. ""What's interesting is the degree to much the counties dominated ... [those counties] essentially account for almost 40% of the variants in the state that's out there.""

""It's hard to ignore that we are essentially open for business"" he said noting DeSantis' lift of COVID-19 restrictions this week. ""Now we're seeing this little explosion.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3M0amF4LmNvbS92aWRlby9tb3JuaW5nLXNob3cvMjAyMS8wNS8wOC9wZml6ZXItdmFjY2luZS1mb3ItY2hpbGRyZW4td2l0aC1kci10cmFjaGVsbGEtam9obnNvbi1mb3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer vaccine for children with Dr. Tra'Chella Johnson Foy,"Pfizer vaccine for children with Dr. Tra'Chella Johnson Foy

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXJpem9uYXNwb3J0cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMzU0NzMwMi9mb3JtZXItYXJpem9uYS1wZy10LWotbWNjb25uZWxsLWNvbnRpbnVlcy1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLWluLW5iYS1mb3ItcGFjZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Arizona PG T.J. McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

(FTC).

The partnership is a 50-50 business combination between PMI and FTC through PMFTC Inc. the leading tobacco company in the Philippines.

Olczak made that statement in a global online conference on May 5 shortly after assuming his post as CEO of PMI.

Olczak’s appointment — which was announced following the PMI’s annual shareholders’ meeting on May 5 — came as the company was in the middle of its ambitious vision to deliver a smoke-free future by eliminating combustible cigarettes at the soonest possible time.

He acknowledged how this smoke-free vision started in the Philippines as the company brought IQOS its non-combustible alternative product for smokers.

“We started slowly but surely getting focused on bringing IQOS to the Philippines” he said.

PMFTC started marketing IQOS in Metro Manila last year to users 21 years old and above. On June 5 2020 the IQOS.com website was launched offering IQOS as well as the HEETS tobacco sticks and device accessories.

To date there are 15 IQOS stores in Metro Manila.

In accepting the appointment Olczak committed to accelerating PMI’s smoke-free transformation which was announced in 2016.

The company is focused on developing scientifically substantiating and responsibly commercializing smoke-free products that are less harmful than smoking with the aim of replacing cigarettes as soon as possible.

“I am humbled and excited to lead PMI as we accelerate our transformation into a smoke-free company” Olczak said.

“PMI is an industry leader in scientific innovation and our ambition is that more than half of our net revenues will come from smoke-free products in 2025. Our evolving portfolio will drive our long-term future” he added. “We will lean into our scientific research and expertise using our collective skills and imagination to innovate beyond our existing portfolio and explore new areas of business development.”

The 56-year-old Olczak who holds a master’s degree in economics from the University of Lodz in Poland began his career with PMI in 1993.

He started in finance and general management positions across Europe among them managing director of PMI’s markets in Poland and Germany and president of the European Union Region.

In 2012 he was appointed chief financial officer a position he held until 2018 when he became PMI’s chief operating officer.

He has been a vital driver of PMI’s smoke-free transformation which moved into its commercialization phase with the launch of IQOS in Nagoya Japan in 2014.

Under his oversight as COO PMI increased the portion of its net revenues derived from smoke-free products to 28 percent in the first quarter of 2021.

Further under his leadership as COO the company grew the geographical coverage of PMI’s smoke-free products from zero to 66 markets in key cities or nationwide as of March 31 2021.

He also led PMI’s commercial transformation successfully developing it from a primarily business-to-business company to an increasingly business-to-consumer company.

The head of tobacco giant Philip Morris said the company will phase out conventional cigarettes in Japan within 10 years in an interview with the Nikkei business daily published Friday.

The Marlboro maker announced in 2016 a long-term goal to stop selling cigarettes and replace them with alternatives that it says are less harmful -- but this is the first time it has given a clear deadline.

""We want Japan to be the first market"" for the phase-out newly appointed CEO Jacek Olczak told the Nikkei in an interview published in Japanese.

The company ""will realise a smoke-free society in Japan within 10 years"" he said.

Philip Morris International is betting on its IQOS: a sort of short cigarette inserted into a device that heats the tobacco and releases a vapour.

Olczak told the Nikkei they ""plan to introduce devices using new technologies"".

Japan considered by some a smoker's paradise has long been an outlier in the developed world for cigarette use.

Under a law that came into effect in 2020 lighting up regular cigarettes is banned in most restaurants while heated products are allowed while eating and drinking when certain conditions are met.

Japan's government earns billions of dollars annually in cigarette tax revenue and owns a one-third stake in Japan Tobacco the world's third largest tobacco company.

Smoking in the street is banned in many places under local regulations that impose hefty fines on violators.

Cigarettes cost only around 450 ($4) to 570 yen a pack and carry modest health warning labels.

Despite that tobacco use in Japan has been falling in line with a broader global trend.",,,,,,,,,

Designed by Perkins + Will for a non-profit company called The Turken Foundation the nearly 80000-square-foot structure will stand 227 feet tall and provide Turkish students with 82 turnkey residences both single- and double-occupancy quarters and help with scholarships and job opportunities in the United States. 300 East 41st Street is located at the corner of East 41st Street and Second Avenue near both the United Nations and Grand Central Terminal and was previously occupied by two low-rise properties that were purchased for a combined $17.5 million.

Recent photos show the reinforced concrete superstructure having reached the main setback with the last set of floors remaining to be constructed before reaching the flat roof parapet. Façade installation has yet to begin but a grid of metal stud frames has started going up across the northern elevation along with some green waterproof panels on the lower levels above the ground floor. The mechanical hoist is attached to the slim western profile while sidewalk scaffolding wraps around the entire corner property.

The main rendering shows 300 East 41st Street clad in a light-colored exterior made with porcelain tile panels a stone veneer and a decorative black metal screen featuring a dense geometric motif on the bottom half of the western side and the top half of the northern wall. The rest of the outside has a staggered array of rectangular windows. Overall the building massing color scheme and architectural design create a modern impression without excessive ostentation that blends well with the surrounding neighborhood.

The first floor and basement level will yield 4200 square feet of retail and commercial spaces. Homes will occupy floors four through 15 and 17 through 21. Residential amenities will be located in the basement the ground floor and the second and 16th floors and include bicycle storage study rooms on floors six through 13 a private lounge a laundry room on the 16th floor a gym a concierge a secured entrance a common living and dining area and a private prayer room. It was reported that the apartments will come with fully equipped kitchens and free high-speed internet and cable television. Rooms would cost around $1300 to $3000 and two or more people in a room will be charged $800 each.

A completion date for 300 East 41st Street had not been announced but YIMBY predicts that work could wrap up by end of the year or early 2022 at the latest. Turken House is aiming for LEED Certification with a program goal of LEED Silver Certification.

West rides 'playoff atmosphere' to championship win over Tumwater,"RIDGEFIELD — Sure W.F. West catcher Drew Reynolds was a little bummed he was walked twice in his last high school varsity game. But the Texas Tech-bound catcher left the Ridgefield Outdoor Recreation Complex on Friday with much more than a couple of hits.

""I wanted to make a difference"" Reynolds said ""but my teammates did it for me.""

W.F. West rode a momentous afternoon semifinal extra inning comeback into a 2A district championship win beating 2A EvCo foe Tumwater 7-6 in a back-and-forth battle between two of the premiere 2A programs in the state in 2021.

And bringing home the district title trophy — the pinnacle achievement in a pandemic-shortened season with no state playoff — against Tumwater the team that handed the Bearcats their first league loss in four years last month? (The two teams split the regular season series 1-1)

The win tastes just a little sweeter.

“We did we wanted to win it all and we especially wanted to beat Tumwater at the end"" Reynolds said. ""That’s what we were looking forward to and we got the chance.”

Senior outfielder Kolby Hansen's line drive to right field scored senior Andrew Stafford who hauled in from second and touched home plate first through a collision with Tumwater's catcher.

""When I saw the hit all I could think was 'score get home any way possible' ""Stafford said. ""I thought I had it all the way.""

Tumwater pieced four runs together in the bottom of the second. Alex Overbay's sacrifice fly to center field drove in the first run and Cody Whalen's line drive single to left field pushed the lead to 4-1.

Sophomore Gavin Fugate smoked a two-run homer over the right field fence to spark the Bearcats' bats.

""To see the emotion in the kids in games like this that was the part that was missing in league play"" W.F. West coach Bryan Bullock said. ""It made a huge difference playing something that felt like a playoff atmosphere.""

2A district semifinal recaps photos

TUMWATER 1 WASHOUGAL 0

Junior Ryan Orr tossed a complete game shutout to lead Tumwater past Washougal.

Orr a right-handed Washington State commit struck out 13 batters allowed three hits and one walk. He also went 2-for-2 with a double .

""I got my curveball over struggled to get it over in the first couple innings but third fourth rest of the way on it got over"" Orr said. ""My changeup was really good today I use that a lot. I felt good.""

The T-Birds' lone run came in the fourth inning when Alex Overbay drove Grady Finney in from second base with a single to center field.

The Panthers had runners on first and second in with two outs in the bottom of the seventh when Orr fanned the last batter to advance Tumwater to the district title.

W.F. WEST 5 COLUMBIA RIVER 4 (8 INNINGS)

What's the postseason without a little late-game drama?

Junior Brock Bunker's line drive to left field sent sophomore Evan Stajduhar home for the game-winning run to lift W.F. West to the district title game in come-from-behind extra innings win.

The Bearcats loaded the bases while Columbia River led 4-2 with two outs in the bottom of the seventh. That set up senior Brit Lusk's grounder to left field that drove in Bunker and Max Taylor to close the two-run deficit.

The Rapids (River's new mascot) were sustained for much of the afternoon by solid pitching and defense. Senior righty Sawyer Parkin struck out two walked three and gave up a hit and two earned runs in 6.1 innings pitched. Senior Nick Alder the reigning 2A GSHL pitcher of the year came in after Parkin hit 98 pitches and gave up four hits.

Lusk went 1 for 3 at-bat with two RBI and pitched the first two innings.

W.F. West trailed the entire game until the walk-off single.",,,,,,,,,

Jenny Weigold Geertson has been named vice president and client and community relations director for PNC Bank in northwestern Pennsylvania.

She succeeds Vickie Lampe who retired after an 18-year career with PNC.

Geertson previously served as the senior manager of regional community relations and marketing operations for UPMC Health Plan in Erie.

A lifelong resident of Erie she is a graduate of Villa Maria High School and Allegheny College.

Geertson serves on numerous local boards including the presidency of ExpErience Children's Museum secretary of the Bayfront East Side Taskforce and membership in the Nonprofit Partnership and the Erie Philharmonic's board of governors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzUvOS8yMjQyNzgxMS9zaW1wbGUtYmJ2YS10cmFuc2l0aW9uLWVycm9ycy1iYW5rLXNodXRkb3du0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Simple bank shutdown goes awry leaving customers without account access,"The online bank Simple shut down on Saturday and was supposed to seamlessly transition customers’ accounts over to its parent company BBVA. But instead many users found themselves unable to access their bank account at all as BBVA’s website returned an assortment of error messages from “system error” to warnings that their account information was mismatched.

The transition has gone so poorly that BBVA’s US website now opens on a large red banner warning users of extended customer service wait times. Anyone who visits the Simple transition page will see a different red banner apologizing for the issues.

“To Simple customers converting to BBVA: This has not been a good conversion experience for many of you” part of the message reads. “We know this and we sincerely apologize.”

A banner on BBVA’s transition page for Simple customers.

Simple opened to customers in 2012 and was supposed to offer a digital-first approach to banking. In fewer words it was supposed to be “a bank that doesn’t suck” to quote one of its co-founders. The service had a website and app that broke down your spending and made it easy to categorize payments send money and set savings goals. It was purchased by BBVA in 2014.

BBVA said in January that it would be shutting down Simple later in 2021. The decision came from the company “reassessing its goals” as part of a planned sale to PNC Bank which reached an agreement to acquire BBVA’s US operations in November 2020. The acquisition has not yet closed.

Accounts were successfully transitioned from Simple to BBVA on Saturday but technical issues prevented customers from logging in a BBVA spokesperson told The Verge. That led to a cascading series of problems. “Due to the volume of customers attempting to enroll in mobile and online banking simultaneously there were technical difficulties with the enrollment process leading to high call volume in our call centers which overwhelmed the system and created longer than normal wait times” the spokesperson said.

Debit cards ATMs checks and scheduled transactions still functioned properly according to the spokesperson. Though online and mobile account access remains unavailable for users encountering issues.

“We know this conversion process was not smooth for our incoming Simple customers and we sincerely apologize to them” the spokesperson said. “We are working to make it right including extending hours in our call center and adding staff to handle the incoming calls.”

It seems that some people have been able to gain access to their accounts after waiting or working with BBVA’s customer service. Judging by reactions on Twitter from Simple’s very online user base plenty of people still don’t have access though and have been unable to get help from BBVA’s customer service.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1yZXZpZXcuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNS8wOS9tb3VudC11bmlvbi1ob3N0cy1wZXJzb24tY29tbWVuY2VtZW50cy81MDEzNjEwMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mount Union hosts in-person commencements,"Review Staff Report

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

In America mom and pop businesses pay the same tax rate as multinationals. Individual income tax has seven tax rates depending on how much an individual has made. We need the same system for corporate income tax instead of a flat rate that strangles small businesses. Small businesses that are essential for our post-pandemic recovery.

For companies to pay their fair share of tax corporate tax rates need to be fair. Individuals have a progressive tax system – the more you earn the higher rate you pay – but for companies it is a flat rate. That’s not fair especially when the US like many countries is committed to the idea of corporate personhood: that a corporation is a legal person.

For small businesses – which are the majority of American businesses – there is really no difference between corporate and individual income. If the mom and pop store does well so do Mama and Papa. This is what makes the current system even more unfair.

The inherently fair idea of progressive taxes (where the more you earn the higher rate you pay) has deep roots in Western civilization. The famous economist Adam Smith wrote about this concept centuries ago. Even John Locke a man who famously hated taxes was in favour of progressive taxation. The idea originates in Ancient Greece and in the arguments of Aristotle and is intimately linked with democracy itself.

We can all agree that this makes sense for individuals. So why does this same principle not apply to business? I think it should especially because I believe every individual has an entrepreneur within them. Anyone can – and should – be a CEO a builder of opportunity and wealth. But government policies have to encourage that and protect capitalism from the threat of increased social divides.

Two individuals Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos now have more wealth than the bottom 40% of Americans. The share of total wealth of the upper class in the US has increased from 60% to 79% in the last 40 years while the lower class share has decreased from 7% to 4% and the middle class’s share has dropped from 32% to 17%.

This doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t aim to raise more corporate taxes – we should. Out of $3.46 trillion revenue income realized by the US government only about $230 billion or close to 6.6% was contributed by corporates.

Some corporates can afford to pay more – especially Big Tech because they don’t even pay the low flat rate they should be paying. In the UK for example Amazon paid £293 million in tax even though it made £13.73 billion in sales in 2019 or about 2%. This is in stark contrast to the 21% corporation tax it is supposed to pay.

We need more fairness to protect true capitalism. Fairness isn’t just a socialist value it is about providing equal opportunity for all citizens to prosper through wealth creation.

It’s unfair that those small businesses and start-ups end up paying proportionally more than their multi-national counterparts. But this is also economically stifling: Instead of allowing founders the space to breathe grow and make new hires they are faced with big strong competitors who pay effectively lower taxes (because they can afford the best tax attorneys).

The American Dream is predicated on the idea that one can start a new business work hard and be the master of his or her own destiny. A regressive corporate tax policy which we have now flies in the face of this ideal.

In 2020 804398 new businesses were started in the US. We have to give these businesses a fair opportunity to grow. By taxing them at the first hurdle we stifle the chance of the next Facebook and Google being born which could equally lead to much less tax revenue down the line.

Lowering or abolishing start-up business tax can counter-intuitively increase tax revenue for the federal government in the long-term.

More importantly it can remind us what America is really about and bring our communities and generations together at a time when we need unity growth and innovation more than ever before.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvMjAyMS9tYXkvMTAvYXJlLXdlLXByb2dyZXNzaXZlLW15LW9hdGgtd2UtYXJlLWEtbG9jYWxzLWd1aWRlLXRvLWFsYmFueS13ZXN0ZXJuLWF1c3RyYWxpYdIBe2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvMjAyMS9tYXkvMTAvYXJlLXdlLXByb2dyZXNzaXZlLW15LW9hdGgtd2UtYXJlLWEtbG9jYWxzLWd1aWRlLXRvLWFsYmFueS13ZXN0ZXJuLWF1c3RyYWxpYQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Are we progressive? My oath we are!’ A local’s guide to Albany Western Australia,"Perched on Western Australia’s southern tip Albany clings to the shores of King George Sound and the sheltered bays of Princess Royal and Oyster harbours. Granite peaks are surrounded by bushland rich with wildflowers.

It’s the home town of sisters Vikki Thorn and Donna Simpson two-thirds of folk-rock trio the Waifs.

Thorn describes her childhood as idyllic. “That was because of the topography of the place” she says. “It’s very accessible to a lot of beautiful places.” Thorn married an American and usually lives in the US but during the pandemic she chose to bunker down in her hometown.

Albany has changed a lot since Thorn left at 18. “It was a small town based on primary industries and a lot of those don’t exist any more” she says. “The positive changes are that it’s a little more cosmopolitan now – the cafes are better the food’s better and there’s more arts programs and festivals going on.”



But some things have stayed the same. “I really appreciate that on any given day you can find a deserted beach to have all to yourself – not only one or two but dozens and you’ll be the only person there. I like the feeling of isolation if you want it.”

The same geography Thorn loves has sheltered the Menang Noongar people for up to 80000 years says Menang elder Vernice Gillies. “It’s a safe place. It’s protected and we’ve got our natural harbour and rivers for fishing in the shallows and gathering shellfish like oysters” she says. These days Gillies’ company Kurrah Mia Cultural Tours guides visitors through ancient sites such as stone fish traps estimated to be between 6500 and 10000 years old.

The Albany community values its Indigenous heritage. “Are we progressive? My oath we are!” says Gillies. In 2003 the city of Albany council established the Albany Aboriginal Accord and during 2020 Albany began a dual naming project restoring Menang names to many key sites. “Our project will result in a legal process to formalise that dual and restored naming” Gillies says.

The Menang name for Albany was Kinjarling meaning “place of plenty” often attributed to plenty of rain. The rain percolated into limestone aquifers and with the Mediterranean climate allows award-winning whisky to be produced on the shores of Princess Royal harbour.

“Our water comes from underneath our distillery and it’s the mineralisation that creates the phenomenal whisky” says Cameron Syme founder of Great Southern Distillery Company. The required peat bogs are sourced near the Valley of the Giants in Walpole. “The peat’s unique and the whisky is beautiful and soft and subtle so people in Albany are proud of us now which is a lovely thing” he says.

Early Europeans also valued Albany’s geography. With its deep-water harbour it became the first European settlement in WA in 1826 a strategic location for shipping and national defence. Many heritage buildings still line the main streets today bustling with visitors.

The clean environment and temperate climate mean the great southern region produces excellent fruit and vegetables and also fine wines. Don’t miss the cherries in summer and the cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay all year.

This natural bounty extends to the sea. Historically this didn’t augur well for Albany’s abundant whales with the whaling station here being Australia’s last – operating until 1978. These days livelihoods are still made at sea but today it’s whale watching fishing and aquaculture.

Don’t miss

In 1914 Albany’s safe anchorage was the rendezvous point for the first and second conveys of ships bound for the first world war transporting 41000 Anzacs. Today the town that farewelled them commemorates their sacrifice in the National Anzac Centre overlooking King George Sound. Here you can follow a service man or woman on their journey through the war.

After the Two Sessions there is usually the China Development Forum in Beijing and the Boao Forum in tropical Hainan province from which China watchers can catch many policy signals. We’ve collected views and insights from the Boao Forum in late April especially points on financial opening digital currency and financial support for carbon neutrality in a special briefing for our readers. The original comments were mostly made in Chinese and they have been translated and edited for clarity.

Financial opening

China’s financial opening has two components in the area of capital markets. One is opening up to financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs to enter the market; the other is basic opening to overseas investors through QFII and the Shanghai-Hong Kong and Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect programs.

• With the increase of foreign investment’s holdings in recent years our stock market became much better. One reason is the growing role of foreign capital in pricing.

• The CSRC attaches great importance to the stability of China’s stock market and takes good precautions. For example for the Shanghai-Hong Kong and Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect programs we have maintained a daily quota of 50 billion yuan in and 42 billion yuan out. When the stock connect programs were designed it was stipulated that if a certain foreign capital caused large fluctuations in the stock market its trading could be suspended temporarily. The CSRC has the means to prevent the large inflow and outflow of foreign capital causing market instability.

○ Foreign retail investors which make up a small share will not affect China’s financial stability.

○ Foreign mutual funds pension funds and insurance companies engaged in global asset allocation; they can stabilize the market and position for the long term. They are very welcome and the largest proportion of positions held today.

○ Foreign brokers with hedge funds’ backing these could be our concern.

U.S.-listed Chinese companies currently face audit supervision problems. The CSRC considers the requests made by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) perfectly reasonable since Chinese companies are listed in the United States they must abide by American rules. We should find a way for the PCAOB to inspect Chinese accounting firms and do so in a manner that meets China’s national security requirements.

• The CSRC and the PCAOB had been working together for at least four or five years and I have always been personally in charge of this subject. There was a great deal of progress and then the political climate in the United States shifted greatly. As a result cooperation with China declined.

• The CSRC provided the latest proposal on Aug. 4 2020 to satisfy the PCAOB’s requirement with a joint inspection but unfortunately because of the political atmosphere they have not responded to any of email inquiries we sent monthly since August last year. Besides the U.S. has rolled out some regulatory measures such as mandatory delisting. In my opinion this is not a cooperative attitude.

• The CSRC hopes that the new U.S. administration will refocus on Sino-U.S. financial cooperation which is in the interest of the U.S. and is what many financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs are looking for as well.

Digital payments

From Zhou Xiaochuan vice chairman of Boao Forum for Asia and former governor of the PBOC

• Currently the central bank’s priority in developing the digital yuan remains upgrading its retail system. The development of the digital yuan initially targets China’s vast retail market rather than using it for cross-border transactions as improving retail system efficiency is the basis for developing all other businesses including the wholesale system and cross-border payments.

• Both digital currencies and digital assets should serve the real economy. Cryptocurrencies are still in the early stages of development and it remains to be seen whether they can better act as investment alternatives.

• Cross-border payments via central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are very complex. Given that every country has its own macro-control situations and monetary sovereignty certain foreign exchange controls cannot be easily removed meaning there will be no trend towards monetary integration in the short term. However with respect to the monetary sovereignty of central banks digital technology can still be used to greatly improve convenience.

• The potential of cross-border use of the digital yuan will mainly depend on the Chinese currency’s global status which would be determined by China’s economy currency stability and convertibility. It also depends on market choice. Global market participants will compare and choose the best among different currencies.

○ China’s CBDC will not have a major impact on global financial markets as its use in cross-border payments is currently found mainly in small retail operations.

• There are strengths and weaknesses of yuan internationalization when it is compared to U.S. dollar

○ Strengths: China is the world’s second-largest economy. In addition to the sound development of trade and modern service industries China also has a large number of outbound tourism consumers many countries therefore attach great importance to Chinese consumers.

○ Weaknesses: The yuan still trails behind the U.S. dollar in terms of convertibility and free use. However as China’s economic and trade status continues to rise so will the status of the currency.

• Hong Kong residents will be able to use the digital yuan without any obstacles and digital development will bring more convenience in the future. The PBOC and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are studying cross-border payments using digital yuan with technical testing already underway.

There is no specific timetable for digital yuan’s official rollout but the PBOC is considering launching trials in more cities and having them cover more usage scenarios to enhance its ecosystem. Meanwhile the PBOC is studying regulatory rules for Bitcoin and Stablecoins. If any type of Stablecoin is to become a widely-used instrument for payment in the future it must be subject to strict oversight like financial institutions.

• Lessons from previous digital yuan pilot projects include:

○ The two-tier system of the digital yuan appeared to be working. The issuance and distribution mechanism of the digital yuan are compatible with the existing financial system helping to minimize the impact on the banking sector.

○ Digital currency has controllable anonymity. Small transactions can be anonymized under current system while larger transactions can be tracked.

○ The central bank could try a hybrid system. The digital yuan can be linked to both the banking system and the token system. This way it has different degrees of coupling in different technical solutions.

• The progress of the digital yuan. The focus of developing the digital yuan will be mainly for domestic use. There is no detailed timetable on the progress of the digital yuan but there are still things to be done before its nationwide rollout including:

○ Increasing the number of trials and expanding its scope. China is trying to make it possible for foreign athletes and visitors to use its digital currency during the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022.

○ Boosting the infrastructure for the yuan’s digitalization to improve the security and reliability of the system.

○ Setting up a set of legal and regulatory frameworks to monitor relevant businesses.

• Yuan internationalization is a natural process that does not aim to replace the U.S. dollar or any other currency but let the market make choices and facilitate international trade and investment. The PBOC has joined the Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency (mCBDC) and it will cooperate with global partners to work out a cross-border payment solution for digital currencies over time.

• China considers crypto assets like Bitcoin and Stablecoins as investment alternatives and highlights the need for a better regulatory environment for such assets. If any type of Stablecoin is to become a widely-used instrument for payment in the future it must be subject to strict oversight like financial institutions. But before the launch of any regulatory measures regulators will maintain what they are doing right now.

Financial support for carbon neutrality

From Yi Gang (易纲) governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC)

• First we need to mobilize funds to support low-carbon transformation:

○ The central bank set standards for green bonds and green credit in 2015 and 2018 respectively and completed a catalogue of green bond projects.

○ We will enhance reporting and disclosure. Financial institutions are now required to disclose green financial debt issued in the interbank market and report on the use of green credit. In the future a mandatory information disclosure system will be established step by step covering all types of financial institutions and financing entities and unifying disclosure standards.

○ Build incentives. Green bonds and green credits have been included in the pool of eligible collateral facilitated by the central bank. In addition to creating emission reduction support tools the central bank will increase support for green finance and carbon reduction through commercial bank ratings deposit insurance rates and macro-prudential assessments.

• Second we must manage the financial risks associated with climate change

○ The central bank will assess the impact of climate change on financial stability and monetary policy in a timely manner and study the key strategies for financial institutions to systematically consider climate change when conducting stress tests.

○ The central bank will also continue to increase the allocation of green bonds in its foreign exchange reserves curb investment in high-carbon assets and incorporate climate factors into its investment risk management framework.

○ The PBOC encourages financial institutions to prepare for the climate challenge. The central bank has instructed some financial institutions to measure the carbon emissions of these projects and assess their climate and environmental risks. The central bank is exploring the establishment of a national carbon accounting system and has evaluated the green credit situation of banks on a quarterly basis. Financial institutions are being studied to prepare for a performance evaluation system on green credit green bonds and others.

• Third we must strengthen international coordination and cooperation

○ There is a wide demand and broad consensus in Asia on green transformation. Major economies have taken positive actions and cooperation at the regional level is progressing in an orderly way.

• There are still some problems in the development of green finance. For example the price of some assets does not fully reflect the negative externalities on the environment.

○ The environmental information of some enterprises is not effectively disclosed.

○ Many industries have not incorporated carbon pricing in their work.

From Ouyang Weimin president of China Development Bank (CDB)

• Development finance is an important way to achieve carbon neutrality. At present the CDB holds more than 2.3 trillion yuan of green credit bonds issued 70 billion yuan of green credit bonds in total. The bank will focus on implementing the “100 billion 100 counties” project to select no less than 100 counties and to provide a 100 billion yuan total loan commitment.

• Looking overseas the CDB has a loan balance of more than $70 billion in Asia and more than $160 billion along the Belt and Road and in co-founding countries.

Role of sustainable finance in the Belt and Road Initiative

From Qian Keming vice minister of commerce

• The latest progress in the Belt and Road:

○ Trade volume between China and the countries along the route has steadily increased accounting for an increasing proportion of the total foreign trade of the whole country.

○ Global cross-border investment experienced some decline due to the Covid-19 pandemic; however Belt and Road investment saw stable growth.

○ The new contracts China signed with foreign countries last year were mainly with countries along the Belt and Road.

○ China has signed free trade agreements and established working groups on investment trade in services and e-commerce cooperation mechanisms with a number of Belt and Road countries.

○ China and the countries along the route have built a lot of green infrastructure since the Belt and Road was proposed in 2013.

• Next China will focus the following tasks:

○ Promoting green and low-carbon energy in markets along the Belt and Road balancing local demand and sustainable development.

○ Integrating the green development concept into the whole process of outbound investment and overseas cooperation.

○ Promoting the sustainability of developing countries’ debt. Debt issues related to the Belt and Road are complicated and the key to their resolution is development. China will continue to promote debt sustainability in developing countries. Specific measures include:

▪ Participating in the G-20’s initiative to postpone the debt repayment of the poorest countries.

▪ Promoting projects in developing countries that generate steady cash flow and profits.

▪ Strengthening cooperation with other parties to address the debt vulnerabilities of heavily indebted poor countries.

This demonstrated a significant and fatal error in security and election integrity.”

Russell J. Ramsland Jr. sold everything from Tex-Mex food to light-therapy technology. Then he sold the story that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.

ADDISON Tex. — Key elements of the baseless claim that the 2020 election was stolen from President Donald Trump took shape in an airplane hangar here two years earlier promoted by a Republican businessman who has sold everything from Tex-Mex food in London to a wellness technology that beams light into the human bloodstream.

At meetings beginning late in 2018 as Republicans were smarting from midterm losses in Texas and across the country Russell J. Ramsland Jr. and his associates delivered alarming presentations on electronic voting to a procession of conservative lawmakers activists and donors.

Briefings in the hangar had a clandestine air. Guests were asked to leave their cellphones outside before assembling in a windowless room. A member of Ramsland’s team purporting to be a “white-hat hacker” identified himself only by a code name.

Ramsland a failed congressional candidate with a Harvard MBA pitched a claim that seemed rooted in evidence: Voting-machine audit logs — lines of codes and time stamps that document the machines’ activities — contained indications of vote manipulation. In the retrofitted hangar that served as his company’s offices at the edge of a municipal airstrip outside Dallas Ramsland attempted to persuade failed Republican candidates to challenge their election results and force the release of additional data that might prove manipulation.

“We had to find the right candidate” said Laura Pressley a former Ramsland ally whose own claim that audit logs showed fraud had been rejected in court two years earlier. “We had to find one who knew they won.”

Ramsland Huffines He made the pitch to Don Huffines a state senator in Texas. Huffines declined. Sessions He tried to persuade U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.). Sessions declined.

No candidate agreed to bring a challenge and the idea of widespread vote manipulation remained on the political fringe — until 2020 when Ramsland’s assertions were seized upon by influential allies of Trump. The president himself accelerated the spread of those claims into the GOP mainstream as he latched onto an array of baseless ideas to explain his loss in November.

The enduring myth that the 2020 election was rigged was not one claim by one person. It was many claims stacked one atop the other repeated by a phalanx of Trump allies. This is the previously unreported origin story of a core set of those claims ideas that were advanced not by renowned experts or by insiders who had knowledge of flawed voting systems but by Ramsland and fellow conservative activists as they pushed a fledgling company Allied Security Operations Group into a quixotic attempt to find evidence of widespread fraud where none existed.

To assemble a picture of the company’s role The Washington Post obtained emails and company documents and interviewed 12 people with direct knowledge of ASOG’s efforts as well as former federal officials and aides from the Trump White House. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private matters or out of fear of retribution. Three individuals who were present in the hangar for those 2018 meetings spoke about the gatherings publicly for the first time.

By late 2019 ASOG’s examination had moved beyond audit logs. Among other claims Ramsland was repeating the ominous idea that election software used in the United States originated in Venezuela and saying nefarious actors could surreptitiously manipulate votes on a massive scale. As the 2020 election approached he privately briefed GOP lawmakers in Washington and met with officials from the Department of Homeland Security documents and interviews show.

ASOG’s examination by last summer had already cost more than $1 million according to a document the company gave government officials that was obtained by The Post. Ramsland had sought funding from Republican donors whose fortunes were made in the oil gas and fracking industries Pressley said.

This comes from ASOG's confidential “executive summary” of a report on how to “eliminate system-wide election fraud threat” that was given to government officials in summer 2020. (Obtained by The Washington Post)

After the Nov. 3 election to an extent not widely recognized Ramsland and others associated with ASOG played key roles in spreading the claims of fraud The Post found. They were circulated by Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) a staunch Trump ally who had been briefed by ASOG. And Ramsland’s assertions were incorporated in the “kraken” lawsuits filed by conservative lawyer Sidney Powell — who The Post learned had also been briefed two years earlier by ASOG — and aired publicly by Rudolph W. Giuliani then Trump’s personal attorney as they tried to overturn Joe Biden’s victories in key states.

During that period Trump was hyper-focused on making the case that the election had been rigged former White House aides said. He would listen to “literally anyone” who had a theory about it in the words of one former senior administration official.

Ramsland Among those voices were the people in Ramsland’s network. Gohmert Powell Giuliani In the aftermath of the election Trump was surrounded by those repeating claims Ramsland had made ... Trump ... and in seeking to overturn the election Trump himself embraced some of those ideas.

The idea that the election was stolen took root and remains persuasive to millions of Americans. Although Trump’s own Department of Homeland Security called the election the “most secure in American history” polls have consistently shown that about one-third of Americans — including a majority of Republicans — believe that Trump lost because of fraud. An internal poll by the National Republican Senatorial Committee in March found that among Republicans who believed the election was stolen nearly half said hacked machines were partly to blame and an additional 8 percent said they were the main source of fraud.

The fraud claims have undermined faith in the electoral process been cited as a motivation for legislation to curtail access to polls in dozens of states and spurred the companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic to file billion-dollar lawsuits. Ultimately the conspiracy-mongering helped inspire the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.

In an email exchange with The Post Ramsland 68 confirmed that ASOG provided research for Powell and Giuliani but said that he had never spoken to Trump himself and that the company was “one of many voices” that expressed concerns about election-system vulnerabilities. He noted that election security has been a long-standing concern across the political spectrum and said that many others had “reached similar conclusions regarding irregularities in the election system.”

Through an attorney Powell confirmed that she had met Pressley but did not respond to questions about where or about her work with Ramsland. Giuliani and his attorney did not respond to messages seeking comment. Gohmert declined to comment on his interactions with Ramsland.

Through a spokesman Trump declined an interview request.

Pressley 58 said she and Ramsland had a falling out in part over his use of her analysis of election data and her suspicions that his motives were financial or partisan. She said she believes he has not provided evidence for his claims about the 2020 election and fears those claims could undercut legitimate questions about the integrity of U.S. voting. “I’m heartbroken by it” Pressley said recently speaking in detail about ASOG for the first time during a three-hour interview near Austin.

In emails to The Post Ramsland called Pressley “unreliable” and said ASOG ceased doing business with her “because of her lack of technical experience and complete inability to understand electronic investigative work.” He said Pressley had a limited view of the work performed by ASOG adding that “our cyber team had already gone far beyond the simple audit log data and analysis she had initially brought to ASOG.”

Many people and organizations claimed after the election to have evidence casting doubt on Biden’s victory. But Ramsland and ASOG’s role was unique said Matt Masterson a former senior U.S. cybersecurity official who led a team tracking the integrity of the 2020 election for DHS.

Repeatedly and at key moments Masterson said ASOG was the source of morsels of inaccurate information that shaped public perception. Some of the ideas it pushed had circulated previously he said but they were supercharged by the influence and connections of Ramsland and the people around him — and by the air of authority the company provided.

“It wasn’t just that the president would tweet about their stuff. It was all these little nuggets and grist that they provided or that were cited to them in testimony or in the ‘kraken’ cases. It provided the appearance of substance and fact to something that had no substance or fact” said Masterson who has not previously discussed ASOG publicly. “It was like: ‘Look these are professionals. … They have former military experience. And look at what they found.’ They gave those who wanted to push and believe in the lie something to hold on to.”

Convinced there was fraud

The nation’s embrace of electronic voting grew out of the debacle of 2000 when hanging chads and other hard-to-interpret paper ballots muddled the outcome of the presidential race souring many Americans on the analog technology the country had used for decades.

Two years later Congress passed the Help America Vote Act dedicating billions of dollars to modernize U.S. elections. It encouraged jurisdictions across the country to replace their old voting machines with new digital systems.

The result was a massive investment in paperless touch-screen voting machines also known as direct-recording electronic voting machines or DREs which states came to view as simpler cheaper and more accessible to people with disabilities.

“There were some electronic voting machines before that but this was the thing that opened the floodgates to them” said Matt Blaze a professor of law and computer science at Georgetown University who researches election technology and security.

Blaze and other experts warned that DREs introduced new security risks: Without a reliable paper trail there was no way to check whether the machines had accurately recorded voters’ intentions.

As concern about this vulnerability mounted a growing number of states and localities began requiring voting machines to leave a paper trail. Today most voters mark paper ballots by hand and they are then scanned and tabulated by a machine. Some use touch-screen machines that produce a printed copy of the voter’s selections. A few still vote on paperless machines.

There has never been a documented case of a U.S. election being stolen through hacking according to Blaze and other experts.

Still concerns about the security of electronic voting continue to simmer including among experts. It does not help they say that some machines contain modems to simplify the reporting of results and that those machines have sometimes been left connected to the Internet for extended periods.

It was DREs and the built-in inability to verify their results that helped persuade Pressley that her race for a seat on Austin’s nonpartisan city council in 2014 had been stolen.

As a candidate Pressley told voters she had grown up outside Dallas the daughter of a cattle auctioneer. She said she arrived in Austin two decades earlier as a poor single mother and succeeded against the odds. She earned a doctorate in chemistry from the University of Texas at Austin worked for 17 years in the semiconductor industry and owned a company that sold bottled rainwater.

The campaign foundered amid revelations she had previously appeared on Infowars the right-wing website operated by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and on another occasion had said she believed data showed that military-grade explosives were planted inside the twin towers on 9/11. That comment prompted the Austin American-Statesman to retract its endorsement of her. (Pressley told The Post she had “no opinion” on whether planes brought down the World Trade Center.)

The race was not close: Her opponent a community organizer defeated her by a margin of almost 30 points.

Pressley could not believe it.

“I knew in my heart that I had won” she recently told a gathering of law enforcement officers outside Houston one of hundreds of speeches she has given about the case “and I became convinced there was fraud.”

A recount confirmed her loss. But nearly all the ballots had been cast on DREs and Pressley remained skeptical.

She took the case to court.

Among other evidence Pressley cited an audit log that contained nine instances when a machine made by the company Hart InterCivic recorded an event as “Invalid/Corrupt.” She argued that those and other alleged irregularities meant the true outcome of the election was impossible to determine.

A state judge threw out the case before trial and fined her and her attorney for bringing a frivolous lawsuit. Pressley appealed and in 2016 a three-judge panel upheld the lower-court ruling.

“Pressley produced no evidence that the ‘Invalid/Corrupt’ error messages resulted in any legal votes not being counted resulted in any illegal votes being counted or otherwise materially affected the outcome of the election” the Texas Court of Appeals panel found adding that Pressley’s own expert witness testified it was “not known” what the nine error messages meant.

“This type of expert testimony is based on uncertainty and mere speculation and is therefore unreliable and irrelevant” the panel said.

Pressley would go on to appeal to the Texas Supreme Court which said it was too late to take up her underlying fraud allegations but found that they were not frivolous and dropped the fines. Her expert witness had testified that corrupted memory sticks that contain ballot data “could” damage the credibility of vote counting the court wrote. To avoid fines it wrote “Pressley needs only to have some factual basis for her claim … not evidence that is ultimately admissible.”

Hart InterCivic told The Post that the error messages did not impact the tally and that “the election results were accurately recorded and reported.” The company said the error messages indicate a failed connection between memory sticks and the devices that read them — a hiccup resolved by simply reconnecting and trying again.

By 2018 Pressley had become an outspoken critic of electronic voting systems that lack a paper trail. She founded True Texas Elections and recruited poll-watchers in more than a dozen counties to look for evidence of fraud in the state’s March primary that year. Afterward she filed a complaint with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) alleging that Democratic votes might have been undercounted.

On election night in November 2018 the volunteer poll-watchers obtained audit logs generated by the central tabulation machines in Dallas County as they tallied votes some of which had been cast on DREs manufactured by the largest voting-machine company in the nation Election Systems and Software or ES&S. Such logs record an array of activity and can be difficult to interpret for anyone unfamiliar with the software involved.

In a statement ES&S said that its voting equipment has been through thousands of hours of independent testing and that its accuracy has been verified through audits and other examinations.

But as Pressley pored over the logs she fixated on specific words. “Downloaded” “cleared” “replaced” the audit logs said over and over.

Soon she came to suspect that those audit logs too were a window into surreptitious vote-switching.

‘When someone says “I know a guy” …’

Allied Special Operations Group as the firm was first named was initially envisioned as a one-stop shop for government and corporate clients seeking cybersecurity physical protection and sophisticated open-source intelligence services Ramsland and former employees told The Post.

The company was formed in June 2017 by Adam T. Kraft a former senior official at the Defense Intelligence Agency. Kraft was the company’s chief executive and it was based out of his house in a subdivision north of Fort Worth. Kraft declined to comment for this report.

An early promotional video described ASOG as “a group of highly trained professionals who have seen it all” and it stressed the intelligence backgrounds of some team members. “When someone says ‘I know a guy’ he’s talking about ASOG” said the narrator who said that ASOG personnel had taken part in the types of missions “that many of us only see in the movies.”

Months after Kraft filed papers to establish the company he was joined by a trio of other men state records show.

Alvan “Locke” Neely a retired Secret Service agent who first served in the Ford administration became ASOG’s chief operations officer.

J. Keet Lewis was named ASOG’s vice president of strategy. Lewis served on the executive committee of the Council for National Policy (CNP) a Washington-based organization that for decades has been a networking hub for powerful conservative activists and donors.

According to his biography in Securities and Exchange Commission filings Lewis consulted on international energy projects and had helped develop the Skimmer Basket Buddy a patented maintenance tool for swimming pools. He did not respond to messages seeking comment.

Ramsland who was also then a member of the CNP joined as ASOG’s chief financial officer. The son and grandson of West Texas oilmen lived with his wife in the Preston Hollow section of Dallas home to former president George W. Bush and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban.

Ramsland had charted an unusual career path including investment banking consulting on a proposed cattle ranch in the South Pacific and working with NASA on a venture aimed at growing crystals in space. He also owned oil and gas interests in Texas Oklahoma and New Mexico records show.

According to business filings in Florida Lewis and Ramsland later served together on the board of Photonx a company that according to its website uses variable wavelengths of light “to treat specific pathogenic and chronic diseases.” (Ramsland told The Post that in its current form Photonx’s device “expressly doesn’t purport to treat disease.”)

Photonx now has office space inside the Addison hangar according to a mailbox outside and a sign visible to visitors at the front door.

Ramsland was a “numbers and models” man said Gene Street who partnered with him in the 1990s on the London restaurant that Ramsland’s résumé obtained by The Post says was “Europe’s highest-grossing Tex-Mex restaurant.”

“If you ever needed to know where a single penny went he was the guy that could tell you” Street said.

Ramsland had donated to the campaigns of numerous Republicans including Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) campaign finance filings show. He had also run for office himself challenging Rep. Pete Sessions in the 2016 Republican primary as a part of the tea party the fiscally conservative movement that had formed in opposition to President Barack Obama’s agenda. A campaign ad showed Ramsland wearing a cowboy hat and shooting a rifle at cardboard boxes labeled “open borders” and “Obamacare.” Ramsland lost by nearly 38 points.

Weeks before he joined ASOG Ramsland spoke to a conservative association delivering remarks rife with outlandish claims according to video reviewed by The Post. Ramsland called the deadly 2012 attack on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi Libya a “deep-state operation” and he traced the origin of the “deep state” to a World War II-era collaboration involving Prescott Bush the father of former president George H.W. Bush; the Muslim Brotherhood; and liberal financier George Soros — who was born in 1930 and was not yet an adult.

ASOG’s early work included hunting for intelligence about a group of Chinese nationals for an exiled Chinese billionaire an associate of former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon and providing VIP protection details in the United States and abroad a specialty Neely brought from the Secret Service.

In the fall of 2018 influential Texas Republican fundraiser JoAnn Fleming urged Ramsland and Pressley to join forces Pressley told The Post. Ramsland soon shifted ASOG’s attention to election security. Fleming did not respond to messages seeking comment.

Neely said he left his position with the company when resources moved toward election security.

“My focus was and has always been protection and investigations” he said in a brief interview outside his home in suburban Dallas. “They were going a totally different direction and it was just not — they were pouring all their resources into that and it was just not my gig.”

The relationship between Ramsland and Kraft also grew strained according to three people who worked for or with the company at the time. Kraft eventually departed under pressure the people said.

‘It had to get to Trump’

In November 2018 Texas Republicans were reeling from a battering at the polls. Democratic Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke had lost only narrowly to Cruz and strong Democratic turnout had cost Sessions his longtime seat representing a swath of Dallas and its fast-growing suburbs as the party picked up seats in both chambers of the state legislature. Some Republicans were looking for explanations beyond the apparent purpling of Dallas.

Soon Pressley was in the hangar briefing Ramsland on her election-fraud theories. “Russ got really excited. They all did” Pressley said. “I think they saw this as their next big thing.”

ASOG and Pressley began looking for a losing candidate who would challenge the election outcome and force Dallas County and ES&S to lift the hood on their technology to show whether votes had been manipulated according to Pressley and to emails and other documents provided by her attorney.

They alighted on state Sen. Don Huffines (R) a wealthy real estate developer whose bid for a second term in the Texas legislature had just ended in defeat handing his district to a Democrat for the first time in almost four decades.

Within weeks of the election Pressley said Huffines was in the hangar with James E. “Trey” Trainor III who had been nominated by Trump to serve on the Federal Election Commission but was not yet Senate-confirmed. Trainor was advising Huffines at the time.

Pressley presented her analysis of the audit logs and their mysterious “replaced” and “cleared” messages she said. Ramsland told Huffines he was “horrified” by signs of fraud she said. Challenging the result and forcing officials to turn over voting-machine data could prove the vote was manipulated they argued.

Pressley said she and Ramsland waited impatiently for Huffines to decide. In early December he told them he would not challenge his loss.

“We were all ready to go. We had someone who was going to fund the challenge and everything” she said. “It was devastating.”

Huffines did not respond to requests seeking comment.

In an interview Trainor confirmed the hangar meeting with Ramsland and said he advised Huffines not to bring a challenge. Under Texas law contested state Senate races are decided by a Senate vote rather than by a judge.

“We were never going to convince senators that something nefarious had gone on whether it did or didn’t” Trainor said noting that some Republicans might not have backed a challenge that risked embarrassing the GOP secretary of state.

ASOG briefed a number of people during this period including Powell and Gohmert according to Pressley and a former ASOG employee named Joshua Merritt. Pressley said Powell approached her after one briefing in the hangar gave her a business card and called the audit-log analysis proof of fraud.

Ramsland and Lewis were also working to coax another losing candidate to bring a challenge: Sessions the ousted congressman.

Lewis called a Sessions donor and left a voice message suggesting that the congressman’s race had been stolen. The donor forwarded the message to Carolyn Malenick a volunteer for Sessions. Within days Sessions was on a plane from Washington to Texas for a trip to the hangar according to Malenick who joined him there.

A calendar invitation for the Dec. 14 2018 meeting shows that Ramsland Lewis and Pressley were among those expected as was Fleming the conservative fundraiser who Pressley said had connected her and Ramsland.

Also in attendance Malenick said was conservative talk-show host Kevin Freeman.

Pressley said she gave a PowerPoint presentation that began with a picture of Joseph Stalin and a quote attributed to the Russian dictator: “I consider it completely unimportant who in the party will vote or how; but what is extraordinarily important is this — who will count the votes and how.”

Ramsland followed accompanied by the purported white-hat hacker who would not provide his name to the audience Malenick said. The two presented a $4 million plan that included ASOG standing up an “operations” center to search for voting irregularities Malenick and Pressley said.

Malenick a longtime Republican fundraiser told The Post she eventually came to believe Ramsland was misleading donors.

Ramsland told The Post the center was Kraft’s idea and that election investigations are costly. He said Malenick had “problems with truthfulness” citing an FEC case from the 1990s that ended with her paying a $5000 fine.

With a certification deadline fast approaching Sessions too decided against formally challenging his election result according to his brother and attorney Lewis Sessions.

Privately Pete Sessions did not drop the matter. He filed a confidential complaint with Paxton the Texas attorney general alleging “a variety of legally questionable conduct” in Dallas County voting. The complaint provided to The Post by Lewis Sessions included an affidavit from Pressley in which she claimed her poll-watchers reported they had been treated with hostility and had seen an elections worker using an Internet-connected laptop. She also enumerated audit-log messages — including “replaced” and “time stamp mismatch” — she considered suspicious.

On Jan. 31 2019 Pressley presented her findings to Paxton in a meeting in an Austin office used by Ramsland she said. Emails between her and Ramsland show preparations for the meeting.

But again nothing came of the effort.

Ramsland has said in media appearances that ASOG brought information to Paxton’s office and urged further examination. It is unclear whether he was referring to the Pete Sessions complaint and Pressley’s briefing or to a separate complaint and Ramsland did not respond to messages seeking clarification. He told The Post that he now believes Paxton’s office lacks the financial resources and the “level of technical expertise and sophistication” necessary for a meaningful investigation.

In a statement Paxton’s office said: “We take every credible allegation of fraud seriously. In this case after a thorough investigation by our office with the assistance of election systems experts cybersecurity experts and the FBI we found the claims in this case were unverifiable and an audit of the voting records confirmed the outcome of the election.”

Legally the allegations of fraud in Dallas in 2018 had all but reached a dead end Pressley said.

With Pressley in tow Ramsland launched a fundraising blitz traveling to the ranches and mansions of some of Texas’s wealthiest conservative funders. Ramsland told potential funders that their money would support legal challenges to ensure election integrity ahead of the 2020 election Pressley said. “The hook was always Trump — that their guy could lose” Pressley said.

Pressley said that early in February 2019 she accompanied Ramsland to present her audit-log analysis in Midland to Charles Richard “Dick” Saulsbury who had made a fortune in engineering work in oil and gas. In Cisco they met with Farris and Jo Ann Wilks whose wealth stemmed from the sale of a family fracking business.

An email from Ramsland to Pressley on Jan. 30 2019. (Obtained by The Washington Post)

Pressley said pledges as high as $700000 were discussed. The Post obtained correspondence in which Ramsland named Saulsbury as a potential funder and in which Pressley referred to a “Wilks investor meeting.”

Saulsbury did not respond to questions through a spokeswoman. Reached briefly by phone Farris Wilks said he had no memory of providing money to Ramsland and then hung up.

Ramsland said neither the Wilkses nor the Saulsburys were donors. Malenick and a former ASOG employee said the company had sought to raise capital at the time by selling ownership shares. Ramsland did not respond to a follow-up question about whether the Wilkses or the Saulsburys were investors.

Pressley a Republican who has donated to candidates from both major parties said she began to grow suspicious that Ramsland’s motives were political or financial or both particularly in February 2019 when he took her research to D.C. to meet with Washington insiders but excluded her.

“I don’t think he wanted me there and hearing what he was saying” Pressley said. “Everything he was doing … became about getting to Trump. He had this idea it had to get to Trump.”

Pressley’s company True Texas Elections sought a consulting contract from ASOG in February 2019 but it never materialized. As their relationship deteriorated Pressley sent a cease-and-desist letter to ASOG late that month demanding that Ramsland stop presenting her research without authorization according to their correspondence.

Ramsland denied to Pressley that he had tried to exclude her from the meetings in Washington and challenged her allegation that he had co-opted her audit-log analysis. She had shown her presentation to dozens of people without any confidentiality agreement or copyright markings he wrote. “We frankly do not understand how a project to save Texas and our country has turned into this” he wrote in a letter reviewed by The Post. “This isn’t just your project. This has been a team effort from the beginning.”

Ramsland spreads the word

As 2019 progressed Ramsland decided to take his case to the public via “Economic War Room” the online television show hosted by Freeman.

Like Ramsland and J. Keet Lewis Freeman was a member of the Council for National Policy according to membership directories posted online by the watchdog group Documented.

“We finally decided that if we couldn’t get the government to pay attention without public opinion and public pressure the best guy to go to would be Kevin” Ramsland later recalled in a panel discussion a recording of which is posted online.

Asked whether CNP had supported Ramsland’s efforts the group’s executive director former congressman Bob McEwen (R-Ohio) said: “CNP is a convening organization of several organizations and individual members. And that’s what it does. It doesn’t sponsor legislation or oppose legislation. It is an opportunity for people patriotic citizens to gather together to share their concerns and interests in our nation’s security.”

In emails exchanged over the course of a week Freeman said he was unavailable to answer questions about his presence at the meeting and his involvement with Ramsland.

Ramsland appeared on the show multiple times in 2019 and 2020 at least once with another ASOG employee who appeared with his face in shadow and voice disguised. The employee’s identity was kept secret on the show with Freeman referring to him as Jekyll a “white-hat hacker.” It was the same purported hacker who had accompanied Ramsland during meetings in the hangar with Sessions and others according to Pressley and Malenick.

The Post has reported that Jekyll is Merritt a former Army mechanic who studied network security administration after leaving the military. In December The Post reported that affidavits in Powell’s lawsuits from a purported “military intelligence expert” using the pseudonym “Spider” were actually written by Merritt.

Merritt who told The Post in December that he had briefed Powell and Gohmert declined to comment for this report.

Together Ramsland and Merritt painted a picture of an entirely porous voting system wide open and hackable. Ramsland made a range of specific claims including that hackers or rogue operators could direct vote data to a remote location change it and then “re-inject” it or they could unleash “some sort of a bot” to change the results without anyone noticing. He said there were indications that vote manipulation was already happening and said all major U.S. voting-machine companies were vulnerable.

Among his claims was that source code initially written by the company Smartmatic formed the basis of much of the election software used in the United States. Ramsland often pointed out as other critics had that Smartmatic’s founders were Venezuelan.

Representatives of ES&S Dominion and Hart InterCivic the nation’s three largest voting-machine companies told The Post they do not use or license Smartmatic software. They all said their companies’ software code is not in any way based on Smartmatic code and Smartmatic said its code is not incorporated in other companies’ software.

Ramsland told The Post that “many cyber groups” have reported that different companies share software code similarities. He did not respond to questions asking that he name any cyber groups that support his claims about Smartmatic code.

In his media appearances Ramsland also resurfaced an old baseless claim about Scytl a Spain-based election technology firm that he described as a “somewhat disturbing company” in one appearance on Freeman’s show. “They’re housing all of our votes and they’re doing it in an insecure fashion” he said in a September appearance.

The following month Ramsland added a twist claiming on an online talk show hosted by conservative Debbie Georgatos that American votes were “being held on a server in Frankfurt Germany.”

Scytl has said that it has no servers in Frankfurt and that its systems are not used to count or “house” votes in U.S. elections. Ramsland told The Post in an email that “any 8th grader with a reasonable background in white hat cyber investigation tools” could trace votes to a Scytl server in Frankfurt.

One of Scytl’s products is a platform used by some counties to publicly display unofficial vote tallies online on election night according to the company. After polls close as results begin trickling in they are published online by media outlets and state and local governments. Those unofficial election-night reports depend on tallies that are transmitted by local officials to a publishing system. In some counties that publishing system is made by Scytl.

Ramsland claimed to The Post that Dallas County’s use of such a Scytl platform showed votes were sent overseas.

But Harri Hursti a data-security expert who has spent years highlighting vulnerabilities in electronic voting technology said that Ramsland’s claims about vote-fixing overseas were nonsensical. Even if a hacker could manipulate the numbers that are posted online the underlying votes would not be affected Hursti said. Those are kept separately sequestered from the Internet and they are — once tallied and checked for discrepancies — the official results of any election.

ASOG paid Hursti’s company Nordic Innovation Labs $2500 in November for an 18-page memo explaining the history of Dominion its business acquisitions and the many systems and machines Dominion now supports according to Nordic’s managing partner Dan Webber.

Hursti said he believes ASOG ignored information he provided in an effort to shape a sensational narrative about election fraud. Such baseless claims are now distracting time and attention from actual election-security problems he said.

“This is counterproductive” he said. “There is so much that needs to be fixed.”

Over this same period in 2019 and 2020 Ramsland was attempting to win the attention of Washington insiders an effort Gohmert was also engaged in.

Gohmert has said that a year before the election he gave Trump information from a group of “former intelligence people that were monitoring the election in Dallas County” — a description that closely resembles the way ASOG portrays itself — and that the president considered it “a real problem.” Speaking on a podcast in November Gohmert said his own reaction to the information was “Holy cow.”

In July 2020 ASOG gave a two-hour briefing to seven members of the House Freedom Caucus Ramsland told MyPillow founder Mike Lindell for his movie about alleged election fraud. Ramsland said members were “horrified” at what ASOG presented.

ASOG also reached out that summer to the Senate Homeland Security Committee and was referred to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency part of DHS. CISA reviewed a packet of information from ASOG that included the document saying the cost of the company’s investigation had surpassed $1 million. Also included was an affidavit from Pressley and over 40 pages dedicated to her and her poll-watchers’ observations of the vote in Dallas County in 2018. The Post obtained the documents.

An excerpt from ASOG's May 2020 “introduction briefing outline” which the company gave to government officials. (Obtained by The Washington Post)

Ramsland said that DHS officials in Texas found ASOG’s information compelling but that CISA officials in Washington were “too busy to take a briefing” and agreed to only a short call.

In a statement DHS confirmed that its officials had spoken with Ramsland and his associates “reviewed the information provided and determined that it was speculative and not actionable.”

A full-court press

Hours after the final votes were cast on Nov. 3 Trump doubled down on the claims he had been making for months. “This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country” Trump said. “We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly we did win this election.”

Over the next several weeks Ramsland and others tied to ASOG played key roles in the full-court press to persuade Americans that the 2020 election had been rigged.

Ramsland and Lewis appeared on Lou Dobbs’s show on Fox Business Network claiming there was evidence of widespread fraud. The claim that all U.S. voting machines secretly harbored Venezuelan software was repeated by Giuliani and Powell in numerous media appearances. The claim that Scytl servers in Frankfurt could be used to flip votes went viral on the right after it was repeated by Gohmert.

On Nov. 12 Gohmert said he had told Trump that data on these servers was critical to getting to the bottom of the fraud.

“I had suggested that the president might get information from Scytl” Gohmert said on Newsmax “and I sent him specifics that he needed to get that would show a lot of fraud.”

The next day Gohmert told a virtual prayer group that the Scytl data would show “how many votes were switched from Republican to Democrat” claiming that he had learned all this from “some of our former intel people.”

Scytl strongly denied the allegations. In a statement the company said its products were not used to tally votes in U.S. elections and that it “does not even have offices in Frankfurt and does not have servers or computers in the German city.”

But Trump fanned the theory according to archives of his deleted tweets. Late on Nov. 15 he retweeted to his millions of online followers a video clip of Ramsland saying in a pre-election interview that votes from 29 states were routed through “a server in Frankfurt Germany” and that Scytl “controls and reports your vote.”

Ramsland also contributed material to Powell’s lawsuits and to one brought by L. Lin Wood Jr. another pro-Trump lawyer seeking to overturn Biden’s victory. On Nov. 18 a nine-page affidavit from Ramsland filed to a federal court in Wood’s Georgia case made an explosive allegation: Multiple precincts in Michigan had recorded more votes for president than what he said was the estimated number of voters.

Ramsland’s claim was amplified the following day by Giuliani and Powell at a news conference at the headquarters of the Republican National Committee. Like Ramsland Powell said that excess votes in some jurisdictions were as high as 350 percent.

The claim in Ramsland’s affidavit soon collapsed under scrutiny. The precincts he cited were actually in Minnesota a mistake Ramsland blamed on “my guys” in his exchanges with The Post. Ramsland said the Minnesota numbers also showed excess votes a claim contradicted by official results.

In an interview Wood said he did not know Ramsland and referred The Post to the lawyer who represented him in the case Ray S. Smith III. Smith noted that a corrected affidavit had been filed to the court and declined to comment further.

Another of Ramsland’s affidavits claimed a 139 percent voter turnout in Detroit — meaning the number of votes cast exceeded the number of voters. Detroit’s official election results show that about 258000 of its 506000 registered voters cast ballots — a turnout of just under 51 percent. Ramsland later filed an affidavit saying his original figures were based on data that was online but that “no longer exists [f]or some unexplained reason.”

Two Ramsland affidavits filed in Arizona purported to expose more than 100000 illegal votes in the state again based on high turnout rates and suggested forensic testing to determine whether batches of fake ballots had been cast for Biden. Ramsland attached the résumés of six “key team members” he said had been involved in the preparation of his material. The only one identified by name was a former ASOG computer scientist who had died a year earlier.

Ramsland and one of his associates also played starring roles in the election-integrity “hearings” that Giuliani and GOP state legislators held in Pennsylvania Arizona Michigan and Georgia. The events were intended to persuade legislators to wrest control of the election certification process and demand further investigation.

Phil Waldron a retired Army colonel who specialized in psychological operations and is now chief executive of a cybersecurity firm appeared as a witness at each of those hearings. He said he was working with ASOG to examine the 2020 election.

“Your vote is not as secure as your Venmo account” Waldron concluded in a hotel ballroom in Phoenix on Nov. 30 provoking murmurs from the audience.

“Pardon me? Say that one more time” Giuliani said.

Waldron obliged. A video clip of the exchange was posted to Trump’s official YouTube page.

Waldron declined to comment for this report.

By December Ramsland was opening doors for people seeking to challenge the election results. He connected Patrick Byrne the billionaire former chief executive of the online retailer Overstock with Powell and Powell connected Byrne with Giuliani Byrne told The Post.

Byrne was bankrolling a group of what he described as cyber experts — his “bad news bears” — to investigate election fraud. “They were the ones really getting their fingernails dirty so to speak hacking-and-cracking” Byrne said in an email exchange with The Post. He said Ramsland who had come to Washington for the effort “acted as the conduit and synthesizer for a lot of research that was being done by other parties and technologists in our network.”

On Dec. 18 Trump hosted a now-infamous hours-long meeting at the White House during which Byrne Powell and her client Michael Flynn Trump’s former national security adviser sought to persuade the president to appoint Powell special counsel to investigate the election including by examining voting machines in key swing-state counties.

Trump ultimately did not appoint a special counsel.

During this period some White House lawyers heard Trump make claims that made no sense or seemed “bat-shit insane” one former senior administration official said later learning they came from a network that The Post found included Byrne Powell and Ramsland.

According to a document obtained by The Post skeptical Trump advisers developed a list of pointed questions aimed at determining whether there was evidence for the claims many of which by then revolved around Dominion. The evidence never surfaced the people close to the former president said.

Byrne told The Post that White House officials “refused to look” seriously at the claims and that he and his allies will ultimately be vindicated.

ASOG gets access to machines

Of all the ways in which Ramsland pushed the stolen-election narrative arguably the most damaging was an ASOG report on Dominion machines in Michigan’s rural Antrim County said Masterson the senior cybersecurity adviser who was then focusing on elections at DHS.

Antrim County became ground zero for baseless claims about Dominion voting machines when early on Nov. 4 county officials posted unofficial results showing Biden winning by some 3000 votes — a seeming impossibility in a reliably conservative region. Election officials quickly acknowledged the mistake and called it human error saying a clerk’s failure to correctly update software had led to inaccurate vote totals. Final results showed Trump had won by more than 3000 votes.

Trump allies seized on the mistake as evidence of rigged or at least faulty voting machines. RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel claimed at a news conference that a “major software issue in Antrim County” could mean results were wrong in other counties using similar technology. Trump tweeted a Breitbart article that sought to tie Dominion software to the error that made Antrim “flip blue in favor of Joe Biden” and to Election Day “glitches” that delayed voting in two Georgia counties.

The following day on Fox News Powell said that computer glitches were “where the fraud took place where they were flipping votes in the computer system or adding votes that did not exist.” She called for an audit “of all of the computer systems that ... played any role in this fraud whatsoever.”

Powell’s wish for an examination of voting machines was granted after local real estate agent William Bailey filed a lawsuit in Antrim County on Nov. 23 alleging that the election had been marred by “material fraud or error.” Four days later an ASOG team working for Bailey showed up at the offices of three Antrim townships and requested Dominion voting-machine records.

On Dec. 4 Judge Kevin A. Elsenheimer a former Republican leader in the Michigan legislature ordered that the ASOG team be given further access to the county’s voting equipment for a forensic examination. The decision which offered a rare opportunity for election skeptics to examine Dominion machines was celebrated by Trump’s campaign.

“BIG WIN FOR HONEST ELECTIONS” Giuliani said on Twitter.

Jenna Ellis a senior legal adviser to Trump referred to the ASOG examiners as “our team” on Fox News. Ellis did not respond to requests to clarify the Trump campaign’s relationship with ASOG.

The ASOG team returned to Antrim on Dec. 6 to examine county election equipment. ASOG’s Dec. 13 report signed by Ramsland made sweeping allegations about a conspiracy to fix the election. It claimed that Dominion’s systems were “intentionally and purposefully designed” to generate ballot errors and then to shunt those ballots to electronic adjudication where administrators could change votes at will with no oversight.

The judge allowed the release of a redacted version on Dec. 14 the day members of the electoral college met to make Biden’s win official. Trump tweeted about ASOG’s report several times claiming it exposed a “massive fraud” that cost him the election and saying Elsenheimer “should get a medal” for releasing it.

ASOG’s report claimed that audit logs for Dominion machines showed an alarming 68 percent “error rate.”

That alleged error rate — which ASOG calculated by dividing the number of perceived error messages by the total numbers of lines in the audit log — was “meaningless” according to an analysis by J. Alex Halderman a University of Michigan professor of computer science and engineering. Halderman who as part of the lawsuit examined the Antrim results and the ASOG report at the request of the Michigan secretary of state and attorney general wrote that audit logs record multiple lines for each ballot scanned and that many of those lines are “benign warnings or errors” that have no bearing on the accuracy of the machines’ count.

For example he said ASOG appeared to count the warning “ballot has been reversed” as an error that showed votes had been tampered with. But that entry means that a voter attempted to feed his ballot into the machine and the machine balked and spit it out — just as a vending machine often balks at a wrinkled dollar bill. That happens all the time Halderman wrote.

Of ASOG’s claim that many ballots were sent to electronic “adjudication” where they were manipulated Halderman said his examination showed that Antrim County did not perform electronic adjudication of ballots at all. Halderman said that ASOG had correctly identified some security weaknesses in the county’s election system but there was no evidence that anyone had exploited those weaknesses.

“The report contains an extraordinary number of false inaccurate or unsubstantiated statements and conclusions” he wrote.

County and state officials as well as Dominion also said key claims in ASOG’s report were baseless.

Ramsland told The Post that ASOG had just six days to do its report and that Halderman’s analysis contradicted only 12 of ASOG’s 29 “core observations.”

Three days after the court released the report a hand recount of the county’s ballots showed that the presidential election results were correct off from the previously reported results by only 12 votes out of some 16000 cast. Dominion’s machines had counted accurately.

“The tabulators did what they were supposed to do and they did it very accurately and there’s absolutely no evidence that there was some reverse cyberattack that manipulated them” said Michigan state Sen. Ed McBroom a Republican who led a state Senate investigation of fraud claims. The ASOG report he said was “probably more harmful to the discussion” than anything else happening in Michigan at the time.

“I don’t see how anybody can take Mr. Ramsland and his group seriously as genuine purveyors of fact” he said. “It’s very clear they’re beyond mistaken and misrepresenting what actually happened either out of carelessness or with some sort of purpose.”

At his “Save America” rally in Washington on Jan. 6 Trump made reference to Antrim County and “the troubling matter of Dominion Voting Systems” as an example of how he had been wronged.

“In one Michigan county alone 6000 votes were switched from Trump to Biden” he said. He also repeated Ramsland’s claim that there were more votes than voters in Detroit. “In Detroit turnout was 139 percent of registered voters” he said. “Think of that.”

He called the Nov. 3 vote “the most corrupt election in the history maybe of the world” and then urged his supporters to march to the Capitol. By the thousands they complied.

Indeed SaltPay has virtually zero online presence other than its own website. There are no mainstream press reports or interviews and a Google search lends little insight into the two-year-old European payments company.

But some are paying attention at least.

High-profile investors including Hedosophia and Tiger Global are among those who recently participated in SaltPay's April $500m Series C according to two sources.

So what is SaltPay? What's its big strategy? Why are investors buzzing about it? And why is the startup sweeping up tiny payments firms?

Sussing out SaltPay

Founded in 2019 SaltPay has taken an unusual approach in quickly building a pan-European cooperative of payments components targeting small and medium merchants.

In real terms that means several different payment brands now sit under the SaltPay group across Portugal Hungary the Czech Republic Iceland and the UK following an aggressive acquisition strategy (""they're spending like crazy"" one peer commented).

It also means the group does everything from merchant acquiring and issuance (eg. card processing and transactions) to offering credit to providing a broad suite of software services like spend management and loyalty schemes.

SaltPay's ""rollup"" strategy means it now employs over 800 people globally. It has doubled its staff in the last few months; drawing graduates from top schools like the London School of Economics.

If all that doesn't sound like your everyday early-stage startup... it's because it isn't.

SaltPay is led by an experienced founding team headed up by Eduardo Pontes a Brazilian entrepreneur who previously cofounded Stone — a Brazilian payments acquirer that went public in 2018 and is described as South America's Square. His cofounder Ali Mazanderani was also a board member at Stone.

The ""Stone gang"" have each invested personally into SaltPay an insider told Sifted and its founders remain the largest shareholders (the full list of investors remains undisclosed).

The ""next Adyen?""

SaltPay claims it is building Europe's ""go-to"" payments and operations hub for small and medium enterprises with its broad suite of efficiency-building and automated services.

The company told Sifted it currently counts over 60k merchants across its various subsidiaries largely concentrated in Eastern Europe with UK expansion next on the roadmap.

Aside from distributing directly to European merchants moreover it is also developing a software and infrastructure arm — akin to a fintech-as-a-service platform — to rent out globally.

That could put the company up against everyone from WorldPay to Marqueta as well as point-of-sale providers like SumUp or Viva Wallet.

Nonetheless in a rare interview Chairman Ali Mazanderani argued SaltPay was tapping into a market that is still underinvested in.

I'm super passionate about local entrepreneurs especially in tier two towns especially underserved areas... the market just doesn't really speak to them.

""All the focus in the fintech space is...enterprise online acceptance or digital banks. But we are interested in helping the family-owned restaurant outside Newcastle for example"" he said. ""I'm super passionate about local entrepreneurs especially in tier two towns especially underserved areas... the market just doesn't really speak to them.""

Mazanderani commented that SaltPay is using ""customer-centricity"" and its sprawling network of services to differentiate itself.

Today SaltPay's ambition is so vast that one analyst said SaltPay is known in investor circles to be ""selling [itself] as the next Adyen.""

Still Mazanderani poo-pooed the comparison.

""Our focus is simply on putting the small businesses first"" he told Sifted.

Buy not build

What's striking about SaltPay so far is its 'buy buy buy' approach to growth.

Over the last year SaltPay has used its funding arsenal to go on an M&A warpath scooping up six startups over the last 12 months — including Iceland's Bogun and London's YoYo Wallet.

Mazanderani who spent a decade in private equity says the acquisitions are an ""augmentative approach."" In layman terms that means SaltPay has radically changed its subsidiaries' compositions (although it's kept most of their original management in place).

SaltPay has several focuses; from merchant acquiring services to a ""software"" arm

For outsiders though SaltPay's M&A strategy has raised eyebrows.

One analyst Sifted spoke to described it as a ""weird PE rollup of companies"" while another questioned why SaltPay was ""hovering up all sorts of mediocre companies.""

Meanwhile an ex-SaltPay employee questioned whether ""buying companies left right and centre"" would lend a lack of focus.

The ex-employee also said that the takeovers has been bumpy at places like YoYo claiming that some staff the person had spoken to there were ""confused"" about the leadership and direction of their company after SaltPay took a majority stake.

""[SaltPay] need to be very aggressive with growth or they won't get foothold in a very competitive market....that's why they're buying...but you can't merge random groups together and expect it to all work out [immediately]"" the individual told Sifted speaking on the condition of anonymity.

Nonetheless Haakon Overli at Dawn Capital argues there's a clear logic to private equity growth approaches like this.

""It's a pretty smart thing to do...It's more common than you think"" he told Sifted. ""Plenty of Dawn's companies have grown very strongly with selective acquisitions.""

Keeping tabs

For all intents and purposes SaltPay describes itself as a London startup but in reality it looks more like an established global cooperative.

Filings in the US show the SaltPay group officially domains in the Cayman Islands.

Meanwhile its staff are spread across London Portugal and Czech Republic as well as tech hubs in South Africa and Iceland.

In terms of regulation SaltPay is licensed across Europe via its subsidiaries. For instance in the UK SaltPay is regulated via YoYo Wallet which it acquired last year and has an e-money license. FCA records show SaltPay previously used passporting agreements from Iceland.

If that's not enough SaltPay also appears to have a small European venture arm. Public records show the firm has taken minority stakes in several fintechs including Iceland's Noona.

Indeed SaltPay remains something of an enigma. It’s still unclear what it's building underneath the bonnet and its approach to growth makes it an anomaly among other London fintechs.

Still Europe's finance community is now beginning to take note of SaltPay eyeing a new contender intent on shaking up the sector.",,,,,,,,,

The Nokia 8.3 5G and the Samsung S21 are the flagships of their respective brands. Nokia 8.3 5G is one of the latest handsets to offer the fast connectivity tech together with some impressive mid-range specs while Samsung S21 Ultra is a very good midrange phone with amazing features.

Nokia 8.3 5G and Samsung S21 Specs and Features

The Nokia 8.3 5G is a midrange phone that offers strong power and performance even though it is not going to compete with the 5G phones from other massive brands.

Instead the phone is designed to be an affordable version that gives users the 5G connectivity and a solid feature-set. It boasts a large 6.81-inch Full HD+ display a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 mobile chipset and a very strong rear camera array.

There is a 4500mAh battery inside which can handle a single charge without any issues and it is also equipped with the latest Android 10 software according to TechRadar.

With all of this said it is difficult to get too excited about the Nokia 8.3 5G. There are other options in the market that offers the same features for less money but the Nokia 8.3 5G is a strong handset overall and it is worth considering if you are searching for a phone that offers strong battery life a massive display and 5G connectivity.

Meanwhile the Samsung Galaxy S21 is a midrange phone with a flagship name. It has a 6.2-inch screen with 256GB of storage as noted by The Verge.

The Galaxy S21 has the newest and the best Qualcomm processor which means it will last you three or more years before you need to replace it with a newer model.

The Snapdragon 888 chipset of the Galaxy S21 means that the phones support both kinds of 5G in the US.

Samsung also prides itself with the design. It has metal rails that flow into the camera bump on the back. The South Korea giant made slight changes to the S21 by changing the usual rear glass panel with plastic.

The S21 lacks MST which is Samsung's tech for paying at credit card terminals that can't read NFC. This is a feature that the Nokia 8.3 5G does not have as well.

There is no microSD card slot for expanding the storage while Nokia 8.3 5G has one. The S21 and Nokia 8.3 5G's screen resolution is the same which is 1080p.

As for the camera hardware the S21's main sensor is 12 megapixels with OIS the ultrawide is 12 megapixels and has a 120-degree field of view as per CNET.

The telephoto has a 3x optical zoom and does crop tricks with its 30-megapixel sensor to offer digital zoom up to 30x. The selfie camera is 10 megapixels.

While the Nokia 8.3 5G comprises a 64MP f/1.89 main camera a 12MP ultra wide camera with an aperture of f/2.2 a 2MP macro snapper and a 2MP depth sensor.

Nokia 8.3 5G and Samsung S21 price

The Samsung S21 price starts at $799.99 for a 6.2-inch screen and $999.99 for a 6.7-inch display. Both with a storage of 256GB.

As for the Nokia 8.3 5G it costs $599 for a 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage while it will cost $699 for a 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.

The Apple iPhone 12 family is a bona fide success. Six of the top 10 smartphones sold globally in January 2021 were Apple devices with the iPhone 12 Pro Max leading the way in popularity in the US. That tells us something: people do in fact want big-screened devices with capable cameras. In fact demand for the iPhone 12 series is also expected to remain strong through the third quarter ahead of the iPhone 13’s fall debut.

Nothing appears to be poised to steal the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s mojo at least not yet. Android phone makers have flooded the market during the early months of 2021 with compelling flagship fare. There’s the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra the OPPO Find X3 Pro the OnePlus 9 Pro and the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra among others.

What about the iPhone 12 Pro Max makes it so popular? Is it the advanced triple camera system the speedy performance or the excellent battery life? It could be any of these things. The real question is: is it still worth buying today? Six months after its initial release (November 13 2020) find out what’s good and what’s bad about Apple’s top-tier flagship in this iPhone 12 Pro Max review revisited. Apple iPhone buying guide: Which iPhone is right for you?

The good

Performance

David Imel / Android Authority

Apple’s homemade silicon is hard to beat. The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the company’s A14 Bionic processor inside which is the company’s top mobile chip. The iPhone 12 Pro Max was a total beast when it launched and it still is to this day. Everything about the phone’s performance has remained top-notch.

In a head-to-head test Android Authority performed last fall the Apple iPhone 12 (not the Pro model but with the same processor) easily smoked the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. The Apple phone consistently outperformed Samsung’s flagship in terms of both CPU and GPU. Granted the Note 20 Ultra was a Snapdragon 865 device. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 which powers a number of 2021 flagships is a generation faster than the 865 — but Qualcomm didn’t close the gap. The iPhone 12 Pro Max still handily beat an 888-toting Samsung Galaxy S21 in our Speed Test GX testing.

The Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max is just as blazing fast six months on as it was on day one.

Nothing has changed about the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s performance since day one. Even after several software updates it’s just as fast just as smooth and just as powerful as it was on launch day. That’s the way we like it. Moreover it will remain that way. Apple devices tend to retain their performance profile for a longer period of time when compared to their Snapdragon-equipped competitors. In other words the iPhone 12 Pro Max will continue to perform well for years.

Battery life Battery life of the larger iPhone 12 Pro continues to be excellent. I can’t kill this phone. The iPhone 12 Pro Max has a larger battery than the standard iPhone 12 Pro and it shows. Not only am I getting a full day but I’m also getting one and a half days of battery — at least — between charges. Even on days when I use the phone intensely (streaming video for hours) it has 40% left in the tank come midnight.

The iPhone 12 Pro Max outlasts much of the competition.

Sometimes phones will show a small hit to maximum battery life by the six-month mark. Not so with the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max. It’s still going strong and outlasting much of the competition. We know that Apple tweaks its software over time to help maintain battery life on older phones. We expect the iPhone 12 Pro Max will maintain solid battery life for some time.

Cameras Apple’s triple camera arrangement produces some of the highest quality photos available from a mobile phone. Time hasn’t changed that. Granted the Galaxy S21 Ultra now challenges Apple but Apple is still in the fight. More to the point the iPhone 12 Pro Max with its huge main sensor and powerful telephoto lens is still a class leader.

Here are some recent samples for you to take a gander at:

You’ll note sharp focus good exposure and accurate white balance/color throughout. Want to see more from the iPhone 12 Pro Max camera? Check out our shootouts below.

Software iOS isn’t for everyone to be sure but given its popularity you can’t write it off. iOS 14 is among the most powerful upgrades to iOS yet and one that makes the platform behave more like Android than ever.

For example iOS 14 supports app widgets. I know I know Android has from the early days but stick with me here. Most of the widgets I’ve tried have worked well and been simple to set up. Not every first- or third-party app has a widget and that’s a bit of a shame. I’d love to see even more widgets from app developers.

iOS 14 also (finally!) has an app drawer of sorts.

iOS 14 also (finally!) has an app drawer of sorts. The App Library as it’s called is the far right-most home screen panel and it contains all the apps installed on the phone. This is another feature that’s been available to Android devices since the beginning. Helpfully Apple has organized them by usage/type and it does a good job of automatically categorizing them. I find myself using the App Library more and more to access apps rather than just use the home screen icons.

Siri still isn’t as good as Google Assistant (will it ever be?) but Siri Suggestions have gotten better over time and I now find them rather useful. Visible when you pull down on the home screen they often suggest an app or an action right as I’m thinking about it. It’s kind of eerie.

Last Apple delivered better software support to its devices than just about any other device maker in the market. Phones that are years old are still able to run the newest version of iOS. For example according to data from Apple 86% of all phones introduced in the last four years are running iOS 14.

For those coming from an Android device iOS 14 makes for the easiest transition to date.

The not so good

Design

David Imel / Android Authority

The iPhone 12 Pro Max still looks good but it certainly doesn’t feel good. The phone has a stainless steel band that wraps around the entire outer edge while Apple’s proprietary “ceramic shield” protects the phone from breakage. It’s a classy if conservative look in today’s market. Toss in an IP68 rating and you’ve got a fairly tough phone. It can handle minor bumps and bruises just fine as well as an accidental dunk in the pool. That’s all good.

What’s not good? The vertical side rails. The phone has sharp edges front and back where the metal and glass meet at perpendicular angles. Combined with the phone’s sheer size it’s a literal pain to have in your pocket. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve uncomfortably jammed my leg when moving around with the iPhone 12 Pro Max in my pocket. As I noted I like the look of this design a lot. Practically speaking however it’s uncomfortable no matter how you use the phone. Comfort is important.

Today’s Android flagships are by and large smoother and more comfortable when it comes to daily use. I’m thinking the liquid OPPO Find X3 Pro. Svelte is good.

Display

David Imel / Android Authority

The iPhone’s screen is plenty bright offers fine resolution and handles most content easily but there are two major sticking points I can’t ignore now that we’re one-third of the way through 2021.

First the notch. No other major flagship is shipping with a notch not anymore. Samsung OnePlus OPPO Xiaomi and others have all moved to punch-hole designs for their displays. The punch-hole is a much more elegant way to manage the user-facing camera. It’s far less obvious particularly when watching video. The notch on the iPhone 12 is a serious bummer. Of course Apple isn’t only sticking the selfie camera in that notch it’s also got its high-tech Face ID sensors in there. Rumors suggest the notch will get slightly smaller in the iPhone 13 but it will still be there. I’m strongly hoping this isn’t the case.

The notch on the iPhone 12 is a serious bummer.

Second the screen’s speed. Most 2021 Android flagships (and even a solid handful of 2020 flagships) sport 120Hz high-speed displays. The iPhone 12 Pro Max display features a 60Hz refresh rate. The difference is most visible when scrolling up and down websites lists or other vertical content. Granted the iPhone 12’s display is smooth for a 60Hz panel but it doesn’t quite match the beauty of today’s 120Hz panels. Here’s hoping the iPhone 13 display makes the jump to 120Hz.

Price There’s no question the iPhone 12 Pro Max is an expensive piece of hardware. It starts at $1099 for the 128GB version and runs up to $1199 for the 256GB model and $1399 for the 512GB variant. You can get decent deals from US carriers but the raw pricing from Apple remains unchanged unless you have a trade-in.

Samsung’s Galaxy S21 handsets are priced similarly to the iPhone 12 family. That’s good news for Apple. Other competing devices such as the $969 OnePlus 9 Pro come in a bit under the 12 Pro Max’s cost while others such as the ~$1500 Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra blow right past it. Suffice it to say if you want one of the best phones on the market you’re going to need to pony up the cash. The standard iPhone 12 Pro costs $999 if you don’t mind the smaller screen and battery.

Charging speed While the iPhone’s battery life holds up the charging speeds are among the slowest in the flagship market. The phone supports wired charging up to 20W and wireless charging up to 15W. That’s only if you buy Apple’s chargers which aren’t included with the phone. If you use a third-party Qi-based charger your wireless charging speed is limited to a pokey 7.5W. Using the optional Apple wall charger will net you approximately a 50% charge in about 30 minutes.

The majority of Android flagships can charge from 0% to 100% in 40 to 50 minutes. The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra for example sports 67W wired and wireless charging and goes from empty to full in just 41 minutes. And the fast charger is included in the box.

Apple needs to up its charging game big time.

Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max review revisited: The verdict

David Imel / Android Authority

To be fully transparent the iPhone 12 Pro Max is my daily driver at the moment. I’ve used it since it went on sale last November. Before that I was on a Google Pixel 4 XL for a year.

Six months later: Do you think the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max is a good buy? 3091 votes Yes 78 % No 22 %

After using this phone for six months it’s easy to see why the phone is so successful for Apple. It covers all the basics and then some. It offers high-quality hardware that’s tough and built well it has some of the best performance of any device packs battery life that competes with most flagships and snaps a really good photo. Sure there are some detractors such as the gawky design slow screen and high price tag but other phones suffer from these same issues.

From my perspective the iPhone 12 Pro Max has completely lived up to its promise. The issues I’ve noted above were there when it first went on sale. Six months hasn’t changed the equation at all. If you’re in the market for an iPhone and want the biggest screen the highest-quality camera and the best battery life you can get the iPhone 12 Pro Max is the only option for you.

The OnePlus 8T is 2020’s affordable flagship from OnePlus. It packs a ton of high-end hardware and software despite its relatively affordable price tag of just $749. Of course there are a lot of great affordable flagships out there these days including the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE (Fan Edition). The 2020 S20 variant has much in common with the Galaxy S20 but makes a few concessions to reach the low price of $699. The real question comes down to this: In the battle between the OnePlus 8T vs Samsung Galaxy S20 FE which phone should you buy?

We’ve already reviewed the S20 FE and OnePlus 8T but let’s take a closer look at how the two phones compare. See also: Samsung Galaxy S20 FE review | OnePlus 8T review

Design

David Imel / Android Authority

The OnePlus 8T features a design that’s not terribly different from its predecessor though there are some obvious differences like a new camera setup found in the upper left corner. The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE looks very similar to the original Galaxy S20 though it swaps out the glass rear for a plastic material with a glass-like finish held together by an aluminum frame.

While both manufacturers have very distinct design languages they have several things in common too. Both handsets have AMOLED displays with the S20 FE sporting a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED screen with a 2400 x 1080 resolution with a 120Hz refresh rate. The OnePlus 8T has a slightly larger 6.55-inch Fluid AMOLED display with the same resolution and refresh rate. Punch holes are the name of the game here though the S20 FE centers the punch hole while the OnePlus 8T pushes it off to the upper left corner. As you’d expect neither phone has a headphone jack.

Both phones offer very iterative designs though there are a few notable improvements.

There are just two color choices for the OnePlus 8T: Lunar Silver and Aquamarine Green. Samsung takes a different approach offering quite a few colorways. You can choose from Cloud Navy Cloud Red Cloud Lavender Cloud Mint Cloud White or Cloud Orange.

If water and dust resistance are important to you you’ll be pleased to know the Galaxy S20 FE has an IP68 rating. There’s no such rating for the regular unlocked OnePlus 8T. However T-Mobile users will be able to pick up the so-called OnePlus 8T Plus which offers the same overall features but does have an IP68 rating.

Hardware

Ryan-Thomas Shaw / Android Authority

You’ll find plenty of power regardless of which phone you choose. Both devices feature the same Qualcomm 865 chipset with 5G support. For those outside the US there’s also an optional 4G-only version of the Galaxy S20 FE with Samsung’s in-house Exynos 990 chip. If 5G does matter to you the Galaxy S20 FE is the more robust choice offering sub-6 and mmWave support. The 8T only supports sub-6 meaning it won’t work with certain carriers like Verizon.

Turning to the rest of the specs you’ll find several differences. For starters the OnePlus 8T has two configurations: 8GB of RAM with 128GB of storage or 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The Galaxy S20 FE comes with 6GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 128GB onboard storage. While there isn’t a model with more RAM or storage you also can add up to 1TB of additional storage via microSD.

Both phones have a 4500mAh battery inside and support for quick charging. The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE has 15W wired charging out of the box but supports 25W with an optional adapter. The OnePlus 8T ups the ante with its included Warp Charge 65 charger capable of charging the 8T to 100% in just 39 minutes. The 8T even can quick charge other devices with speeds up to 45W.

Only the Galaxy S20 FE supports wireless charging with speeds up to 15W. There’s even support for reverse wireless charging of other devices.

Camera

David Imel / Android Authority

The OnePlus 8T has a Sony IMX586 48MP main rear camera along with a 16MP 123-degree ultra-wide camera. There’s a third 5MP macro sensor as well along with a 2MP monochrome camera. Finally there’s a 16MP camera in the front.

OnePlus says the 8T includes some special AI-driven camera features. One of them will automatically detect if the phone is in a low light setting so it can switch to the camera’s Nightscape mode immediately. In our review of the phone we noted that we were disappointed in the overall image quality of the photos taken with the cameras.

In contrast the Galaxy S20 FE has three camera sensors in the back: a 12MP standard camera a 12MP wide-angle camera and an 8MP telephoto camera. You also get a 32MP front-facing camera. In our review of the phone we stated that the Galaxy S20 FE cameras produce solid but unspectacular images. It can also record video clips but they are limited to 4K resolution at 60fps.

Software

David Imel / Android Authority

The OnePlus 8T comes with OxygenOS 11 based on the new Android 11 OS out of the box. While Oxygen OS has historically kept to a very stock-like design the newest software makes a few changes that move it a bit further away from stock Android. Some of the changes include adding a new OnePlus Sans font a new Always On Display and improvements to Dark Mode and Zen Mode.

The Galaxy S20 FE shipped with Android 10 with the One UI skin. However the phone got its over-the-air Android 11 update in early 2021. Samsung has pledged to support the Galaxy S20 FE with three Android OS updates. The OnePlus 8T will get at least two Android OS updates plus an extra year just for software security updates.

OnePlus 8T vs Samsung Galaxy S20 FE: Which should you buy?

David Imel / Android Authority

On paper the Galaxy S20 FE beats the OnePlus 8T in several areas including price. It also supports wireless charging and Samsung promises at least three Android OS updates for the phone. Pictures taken with the Galaxy S20 FE seem to edge out the ones made with the OnePlus 8T. The IP68 rating is nice to have. Finally that microSD slot offers users more storage expansion.

The OnePlus 8T however does offer more onboard storage for its US version along with a lot more RAM. It ships with Android 11 out of the box. Its Warp Charge 65W charger means you will be up and running with the phone in much less time compared to the Galaxy S20 FE. Its glass back is a bit more premium than the plastic on Samsung’s phone. However it’s odd that the IP68 rating is only available on the version sold at T-Mobile.

It’s a close call between the OnePlus 8T and the Galaxy S20 FE and it ultimately comes down to personal preferences. Want to check out some other options? These are the best Android phones you can buy today That’s our look at the OnePlus 8T vs Samsung Galaxy S20 FE. Which one are you considering?

They say never judge a book by its cover but sometimes one’s apparels does really say a lot about them.

A recent study by the University of Michigan have come out with a rather interesting finding whereby men who wear extravagant fashions with large luxury logos embroided on them are more likely to be untrusworthy. Say what?

The study titled ‘Phenotypic Mimicry Distinguishes Cues of Mating Competition From Paternal Investment in Men’s Conspicuous Consumption’ which was published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin found that men who own tees with larger brand emblems are:

Rated higher on mating effort.

Lower on parental investment.

Have a higher interest in engaging in brief sexual affairs.

Less interested in having long-term and committed relationships.

Less attracted to women who want long-term relationships.

Dr Daniel Kruger the evolutionary psychologist who led the study said that one of the purpose of the study was to determine whether men who wear flashy clothes were more attractive to women. Furthermore it also seeks to find whether women may be more attracted to men who are rich and even provide them with a stable financial situation.

In the course of the study the brand Ralph Lauren and its famous polo shirts with the iconic mini horse logo as well as shirts that contain a larger version of the logo were used. A group of men were asked which type of polo they’d rather wear when attending parties and other social events. The research team found that men prefer the smaller logo-branded shirts for soirées as well as job interviews and formal events.

Well after reading this research I’m pretty sure men will be wearing other branded shirts when going on a date. 😛

My mother taught me to see a world without limits and to think about every problem as having a solution.

Being a mother has enabled me to break up with the idea of control both in life and in business. I can guide my son and attempt to plan his every move but ultimately forces beyond my control including his own free will and the ever-changing world around us will influence the outcome and who he will become. This holds true in business. I can plan down to the nth degree but disruption is a constant and fluidity is critical. I wouldn’t have it any other way.

The concept of ‘Leaning In’ is great in theory hard in execution. Motherhood is extremely complex and difficult and sometimes something’s gotta give. Oftentimes you’ll feel like you’re not at your best in either role. Motherhood has changed me in that I am forced to work more efficiently and learn how to prioritize better. Lastly motherhood (and the pandemic for that matter) has helped me be more empathetic to those around me who are also juggling a dual role as a caretaker because life happens!

My children have taught me to look forward constantly assess the changing environment and adapt my approach to achieve the most successful outcome. They’ve also taught me to enjoy the journey…the exploration…the innovation…and to have lots of fun along the way. My life is certainly full both professionally and personally and I wouldn’t change a thing.

They are rated as the top two players from the state of Indiana.

WEST LAFAYETTE Ind. — The Purdue basketball 2021 recruiting class features the top two players in the state of Indiana. After 247Sports released its final recruiting rankings ahead of the 2021-22 season forwards Trey Kaufman-Renn and Caleb Furst still rank among some of the best prospects in the entire country.

The four-star duo is joined by unrated in-state forward Brian Waddell making up the nation's 35th overall recruiting class. They also combine for the seventh-best in the Big Ten. All three recruits won Indiana state championships this year.

However the overall rankings of both Kaufman-Renn and Furst have slightly declined since the start of the year. Here's an updated look at the Boilermakers' incoming players according to the final Top247.

Trey Kaufman-Renn Silver Creek

Kaufman-Renn is the top recruit in the state of Indiana just edging out Furst. Dating back to September of last year he's ranked as high as the 31st prospect in the country. Although since the start of this year his ranking has slowly decreased.

The 6-foot-8 forward from Silver Creek High School in Sellersburg Indiana finishes as the 45th-ranked recruit overall and the 11th power forward in the country according to 247Sports. Between January and May he's dropped nine spots in the national rankings.

He is Purdue basketball's third-highest ranked recruit in program history behind 2015 Homestead recruit Caleb Swanigan and 2007 recruit E'Twaun Moore from East Chicago Central. Both Swanigan and Moore went on to play professional basketball after their college careers.

Kaufman-Renn finished his high school career as Silver Creek's all-time leading scorer with 1832 points while compiling 867 rebounds. The Dragons earned a 95-15 record in the four years he spent on the varsity team.

Last season Kaufman-Renn averaged 24.5 points 11.8 rebounds 3.6 assists and 1.9 blocks per game despite missing five games due to injury. He recorded 13 points 10 rebounds and four blocks in Silver Creek's Class 3A state championship victory this season.

Caleb Furst Blackhawk Christian

While Kaufman-Renn ranks as the No. 1 basketball recruit in Indiana Furst comes in second but edged his future teammate in being named 2021 Indiana Mr. Basketball.

Like Kaufman-Renn Furst's position in the national rankings has been on a slow drop since last year. The 6-foot-8 forward from Blackhawk Christian school in Fort Wayne Indiana ranked as high as the 33rd recruit in the country last year. But he has since settled as the 61st-overall prospect in the 2021 class.

Furst is the 15th-ranked power forward in the class however he's dropped five spots between January and May. Despite the shortfall he will enter West Lafayette as the Boilermakers' sixth-highest rated recruit ever. He sits just behind Kaufman-Renn and 2007 recruits JaJuan Johnson from Franklin Central and Scott Martin from Valparaiso.

Furst finished his high school career with 2067 career points 1254 career rebounds and 213 career blocked shots — which were all Blackhawk Christian records. Last season he averaged 21.4 points 14.1 rebounds 3.0 assists and 2.2 blocked shots.

In the Braves' Class 2A state championship victory Furst recorded 20 points seven rebounds and one assist. After the game he was awarded the Arthur L. Treater Mental Attitude Award.

Brian Waddell Carmel

Waddell is currently unranked as a member of the 2021 recruiting class a reason why Purdue's incoming group only ranks seventh in the Big Ten this year. However Waddell helped lead Carmel High School to a 25-2 record last season.

He averaged a team-high 15.8 points as a senior and grabbed 6.3 rebounds per game. Waddell was an excellent shooter making 60.7% of his shots from the field including 40.5% from the 3-point line. He also shot 85.5 % from the free-throw line.

He scored 20 points and snatched 10 rebounds in the team's Class 4A state championship victory.

Redshirting his true freshman year in 1999 Grossman had to contend with incumbent Jesse Palmer as well as incoming prospect sensation Brock Berlin and started 11 games in 2000 after getting his first shot against the LSU Tigers on October 7. Florida won the Southeastern Conference Championship Game that year and he earned the Most Valuable Player Award for that game.

Grossman started 11 games again in 2001 leading the nation in passing efficiency passing completion percentage and yards per attempt. He finished second in the Heisman Trophy voting that year to Nebraska Cornhusker Eric Crouch in one of the closest polls ever losing by just 62 points.

After a junior season in which he started 13 games but put up slightly deflated numbers under coach Ron Zook in his first year the gunslinger from Bloomington Indiana entered the NFL draft in 2003 in which he was taken in the first round by the Chicago Bears.

Here are the photo highlights from quarterback Rex Grossman’s three-year career in Gainesville with Florida football from 1999-2002.

Nearly everyone who has tried to challenge the quarterback’s supremacy have failed dramatically.

It takes a truly special quarterback to beat Tom Brady at his own game. And that someone special is Peyton Manning. The two quarterbacks entered the league with widely different expectations.

While Manning was the first-overall pick by the Indianapolis Colts back in 1998 Tom Brady was the 199th overall pick in the year 2000.

Both first faced off one another in 2001. With Manning having a stinker Brady’s Patriots romped the Colts 44-13. But that was just the start.

The two quarterbacks met multiple times over the years to come and in the end it was Brady who has the last laugh with the better head-to-head record (11-6).

But Peyton Manning too has a trump card up his sleeve. Had it not been for him Brady would’ve made three more trips to the Super Bowl with three of Manning’s victories coming in the AFC title games.

Retiring in 2015 Manning pulled the curtains on what was one of the fiercest quarterback rivalries of all-time. But just like during their playing days the two have nothing but respect for one another.

Tom Brady to be there for Peyton Manning’s biggest moment

This Sunday Peyton Manning will enshrined among the many greats into the NFL’s Hall of Fame. A huge moment for the record five-time NFL MVP winner.

While the Manning family will be in full attendance another man from his playing career too will be there to witness Peyton Manning’s finest moment.

A classy gesture from arguably the greatest to have played the sport. Brady can show off his seven Super Bowl rings all he wants but on Sunday it’ll be Peyton Manning’s day to capture the limelight."

The company has launched two cards under this category which are based on the new Ampere GPU SKUs.

GALAX Launches GeForce RTX 3080 & RTX 3070 LHR Series Graphics Cards Featuring Brand New Ampere GPU SKUs To Tackle Cryptocurrency Mining

The GALAX GeForce RTX 3080 LHR and GeForce RTX 3070 LHR graphics cards are custom designs and nothing on these cards is changed except the underlying GPU SKU which has been updated to GA102-202 (LHR) for the RTX 3080 and GA104-302 (LHR) for the GeForce RTX 3070. With these new GPUs installed the graphics cards will be limited to a 50% hash rate in cryptocurrency mining algos making them unprofitable in such cases.

2 of 9

Following are all the new NVIDIA Ampere GA**2 SKUs that you can expect:

NVIDIA RTX 3090 - GA102-300-A1 -> GA102-302-A1

NVIDIA RTX 3080 - GA102-200-A1 -> GA102-202-A1

NVIDIA RTX 3070 - GA104-300-A1 -> GA104-302-A1

NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti - GA104-200-A1 -> GA104-202-A1

NVIDIA RTX 3060 - GA106-300-A1 -> GA106-302-A1

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 standard variants were able to deliver up to 100-110 MH/s in ETH while the RTX 3070 nets you around 55-60 MH/s in ETH. But with half hash rate you can expect an RTX 3080 to end up around a 3070 deliver less than 50 MH/s & the 3070 to fall below 30 MH/s as reported by GALAX itself. This would mean that cryptocurrency miners will have to look for other more profitable graphics chips such as the CMP (Cryptocurrency Mining Processor) lineup from NVIDIA.

The new GALAX GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3070 LHR series graphics cards are titled the FG series. We know what GALAX's SG (Serious Gaming) brand means but we aren't sure what FG means. Since GALAX has already outed its LHR lineup we can also expect other manufacturers to follow suit and release their own GeForce RTX 30 LHR series cards. The recent reports do state that the cards are being prioritized to E-cafes in China and it will be hard for actual gamers to get their hands on the cards till 2H of 2021.

Resident Evil Village is the latest entry in the iconic horror series and not only did we love the game in our review we've also been impressed with how well the game runs on PCs with even lower powered graphics cards like the RTX 3060 putting in a fantastic performance.

The fact that it runs so well on PC while also looking mightily impressive and supporting atmospheric effects like ray tracing has meant we couldn't wait to try it out at 8K.

We've tested a range of modern games such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Watch Dogs: Legion at the demanding 7680 x 4320 resolution and even the mighty RTX 3090 currently the most powerful gaming GPU on the market today (if you can find one) struggled to reach acceptable frame rates without some serious tinkering.

Hopefully the fine work Capcom has put into the PC port of Resident Evil Village could give this game a better chance of running at the holy grail of ultra-high definition gaming: 8K at 60FPS. Let's find out how it does.

As usual we started out our tests with the default settings which had most things set to 'High' with 8GB of textures and an overall memory usage of 15GB. The RTX 3090 comes with 24GB of the stuff so that's not an issue though even the high-end RTX 3080 with 10GB won't be able to handle that.

It looked fantastic but it played... not so well. It actually hit an average of 37.6 fps which is pretty impressive at 8K on high settings with even the minimum framerates not going below 30 fps. We usually say that 30 fps is the bare minimum for an enjoyable gaming experience and so the fact that Resident Evil Village goes above that at 8K on high settings is impressive.

However 60 fps is our goal here and the game feels like it was made for that kind of frame rate so even though 30 fps is acceptable the game feels sluggish. Also while most things are set to 'high' ray tracing is off. Turning it on (but keeping it low) didn't impact the frame rates that much however.

There are lots of display settings to tweak including textures which has a number of options that are still labelled as 'high'. By knocking a few options down a single step while keeping things on 'high' saw a slight fps bump to 38 fps.

Putting textures to the lowest setting that is still labelled 'high' with 0.25GB of memory usage and an overall usage of 7.4GB (so the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 can handle it) saw another bump to 42.6 fps. The game still looked great and it started to feel more responsive as well.

Knocking all settings to medium gave us an average frame rate at 8K of 43.4 fps. However it's here that the drop in visual fidelity was noticeable with pop-ins and rougher textures. In a horror game that relies on atmosphere the bump in frame rates at 8K just didn't seem worth it.

But could we hit 60 fps at 8K?

No.

Even at lowest settings we just got 47.5 fps. Turning off all additional graphical features such as volumetric lighting allowed us to eke out a bit more performance (hitting 52 fps on average) but the hit to the graphics was too much to bear. While it certainly didn't look awful the game felt lifeless and flat. It feels like you're missing out on an important part of the game and playing at 8K isn't worth that compromise - especially when any benefits from playing at such a high resolution are diminished when you start drastically lowering texture quality.

The fact that Resident Evil Village looks - and runs - so well at 4K on PC means that this is still the best resolution to play at as you get gorgeous image quality and atmosphere.

So after a promising start Resident Evil Village needs too many compromises to play at 8K unless you're happy with 30 fps on a PC that costs well over $2000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9nYWxheC1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDgwLXJ0eC0zMDcwLWV0aGVyZXVtLW5lcmbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Galax Launches First GeForce RTX 3080 RTX 3070 With Ethereum Nerf,"Galax (via VideoCardz) has re-released the brand's GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 Black General graphics cards with Nvidia's revamped Ampere silicon which cracks down on Ethereum mining.

The new graphics cards with the anti-mining limiter are identical to the previous revisions in every way starting from the packaging to the graphics card's aesthetics. According to the previous rumors Nvidia has reportedly asked its AIB partners to differentiate the fresh variants from the prior ones to avoid confusion among consumers. The Lite Hash Rate (LHR) moniker was rumored to be the internal codename for the new series.

We don't know for sure if Nvidia has specific guidelines in place of how vendors should label the new graphics cards or if they have the freedom to market the graphics cards as they please. In Galax's case the manufacturer is adding the ""FG"" termination to the model name. The suffix could denote something or it could just be a set of randomly chosen letters.

Obviously manufacturers will have to update or release new product pages for the revised graphics cards. For example Galax specifically mentions that the GeForce RTX 3080 Black General [FG] uses the GA102-202 (LHR) silicon and the Ethereum mining performance is capped to around 43 MH/s. The GeForce RTX 3070 Black General [FG] on the other hand now employs the GA104-302 (LHR) with a restricted Ethereum hash rate of 25 MH/s.

Word on the street is that Nvidia will ship its partners the new Ampere silicon in the middle of May so we could see a potential release in June at the latest. Thus far the GeForce RTX 3080 RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 are the only SKUs that will get the anti-mining treatment. Nvidia has allegedly forsaken the GeForce RTX 3090 because the flagship part is simply too expensive to be a key player in the cryptomining game. On the contrary the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti has proven to be a mining monster in a previous leak. Fortunately the approaching Ampere graphics card should also be equipped with the reworked Ampere silicon if the rumblings are to be believed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy83OTI0Mi9nYWxheC1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDcwLTMwODAtbGhyLXNlcmllcy1naW1wZWQtZXRoLW1pbmluZy1ncHVzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GALAX GeForce RTX 3070 + RTX 3080 LHR series: gimped ETH mining GPUs,"GALAX confirms the new Lower Hash Rate (LHR) series cards with the introduction of its new RTX 3080 + RTX 3070 LHR mining GPUs.

We had heard that ""Lite Hash Rate"" (LHR) cards were coming with gimped Ethereum mining performance but now it looks like they're going to be called ""Lower Hash Rate"" and GALAX has spilled the beans.

VIEW GALLERY - 5 IMAGES

The new GALAX GeForce RTX 3080 LHR and GeForce RTX 3070 LHR are exactly what you think: GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3070 graphics cards with Lower Hash Rate performance: gimped for Ethereum miners. GALAX's new GeForce RTX 3080 LHR packs 10GB of GDDR6 at 19Gbps on a 320-bit memory bus while the GALAX GeForce RTX 3070 rocks 8GB of GDDR6 at 14Gbps on a 256-bit memory bus.

You should be seeing around 43MH/s of Ethereum mining power out of the RTX 3080 LHR while we can expect around 25MH/s out of the RTX 3070 LHR.

There's no pricing or availability for GALAX's new GeForce RTX 3080 LHR and GeForce RTX 3070 LHR mining-focused graphics cards but we should see them launch over the coming months. Not only from GALAX but from other AIB partners too.

It seems there's plenty of GPUs to go around when it comes to making complete new series of mining GPUs to stop miners from buying GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards... by using those tiny amounts of GPUs available for mining-specific cards.

Nice.",,,

Partially reversing a 2.71% gain from Saturday Bitcoin ended the week up by 2.95% to $58276.0.

A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning intraday high $59236.5 before hitting reverse.

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $59918 Bitcoin slid to a mid-day intraday low $56255.0.

Bitcoin fell through the first major support level at $57407 before a late move back through to $58000 levels.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact supported by the latest visit to $59000 levels. For the bears Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $27237 to form a near-term bearish trend.

The Rest of the Pack

Across the rest of the majors it was a mixed day on Sunday.

Crypto.com Coin slid by 5.88% to lead the way down with Bitcoin Cash SV (-1.57%) and Ripple’s XRP (-1.80%) also joining Bitcoin in the red.

It was a bullish end to the week for the rest of the majors however.

Cardano’s ADA and Litecoin rallied by 8.88% and by 11.66% respectively to lead the way with Chainlink (+7.40%) also finding strong support.

Binance Coin (+2.37%) Ethereum (+0.29%) and Polkadot (+2.07%) also avoided the red.

It was also a mixed week for the cryptos in the week ending 9th May.

Crypto.com Coin (-6.08%) and Ripple’s XRP (-1.65%) saw red to buck the trend for the week.

It was a bullish week for the rest of the majors however.

Litecoin led the way surging by 44.30%.

Binance Coin (+23.05%) Cardano’s ADA (+33.16%) Chainlink 32.37% and Ethereum (+33.07%) also found strong support.

Bitcoin Cash SV (+7.55%) and Polkadot (+6.93%) trailed the front runners however.

In the week the crypto total market fell to a Tuesday low $2064bn before rising to a Saturday high $2482bn. At the time of writing the total market cap stood at $2395bn.

Bitcoin’s dominance rose to a Monday high 49.44% before falling to a Thursday low 44.65%. At the time of writing Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 45.43%.

This Morning

At the time of writing Bitcoin was down by 0.20% to $58157.0. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning high $58421.4 before falling to a low $58150.0.

Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.

Elsewhere it was a mixed start to the day.

Binance Coin (+0.14%) Bitcoin Cash SV (+2.15%) Chainlink (+1.09%) Crypto.com Coin (+1.26%) and Litecoin (+2.26%) found early support.

It was a bearish start for the rest of the majors.

Cardano’s ADA (0.39%) Ethereum (-0.51%) Polkadot (-0.13%) and Ripple’s XRP (-0.42%) joined Bitcoin in the red.

Story continues

For the Bitcoin Day Ahead

Bitcoin would need to avoid a fall through the pivot level at $57993 to support a run at the first major resistance level at $59590.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break out from Sunday’s high $59236.5.

Barring an extended crypto rally the first major resistance level and resistance at $60000 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of an extended crypto rally Bitcoin could test resistance at the swing hi $64829 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $60904 with the third major resistance level sitting at $63886.

Failure to avoid a fall through the pivot at $57993 would bring the first major support level at $56609 into play.

Barring an extended sell-off on the day Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$55000 levels. The second major support level sits at $54941.

On Jan. 2 2020 the three-term Democrat dropped $19500 on “office rent” to a company called Ruvo Realty LLC. Another $18360 rent payment was made on Jan. 19 2021 FEC records show.

The payments work out to $1625 a month in 2020 and $1530 in 2021.

In his 2019 financial disclosure report Suozzi revealed he was the sole owner of Ruvo Realty an asset he valued at between $100000 to $250000. The report further says that the company began renting office space on Jan. 1 2020.

Ruvo Realty’s sole asset is a single unit in the 3 School St. Professional Condo office building in Glen Cove. The company was expressly set up for the purpose of housing a Suozzi campaign office there where staffers regularly work a Suozzi spokeswoman said.

A sign on the door for unit 305 gives no indication of its affiliation with the Congressman beyond a small white placard bearing the letters TRS — Thomas Richard Suozzi’s initials. The lights were off and there was no answer from inside when The Post paid a visit Thursday.

The building at 3 School St. in Glen Cove NY where Rep. Tom Suozzi according to his FEC report charged Ruvo Realty a company he owns almost $20000 for a district office in January. Dennis A. Clark

Suozzi’s company takes its name from Ruvo del Monte a small Italian town where the lawmaker’s father was born.

Political observers said the arrangement was “unseemly” but likely legal so long as the rent is not inflated. Suozzi’s campaign provided documents showing it was paying market rate.

“It’s absolutely not good. You shouldn’t use running for office or serving in office to enrich yourself in any form. Trump was a master of this” Larry Sabato a University of Virginia political scientist told The Post. When he was a candidate for president Trump famously milked his campaign for a profit quadrupling the office rent in Trump Tower.

“If you actually have set up a campaign group or headquarters or something where it’s really closely related to the campaign it’s not [illegal]” Ann Ravel a former chairwoman of the FEC told The Post adding that she still found it to be “terribly unseemly” and said she would like to see the rules changed to prevent pols from padding their salaries.

“Lots of things are legal that aren’t right” Sabato said.

Kim Devlin a Suozzi political advisor defended the arrangement: “This is much ado about nothing. This is a straightforward transaction pre-approved by ethics attorneys and fully disclosed. The campaign office lease is below fair market value and fully compliant.”

Suozzi like the rest of his House colleagues will face voters again in 2022 and his campaign committee remains active.",,,,,,,,,

The therapy was granted emergency use authorization in India a couple of days ago.Named ‘REGN-COV2’ the drug is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies Casirivimab and Imdevimab It is projected to reduce hospitalization by 70%. The drug was tried by former US president Trump after he developed Covid-19 last year.The therapy is also being looked at something that would help those whose vaccine barrier the virus has breached. It is also expected to be effective on children above 12 years (having body weight more than 40 kg) during the projected third wave when the younger poulation is likely to be at greater risk of contracting the infection.Reaserchers is the western world are strongly pushing for yet another combination of monoclonal antibodies Eli Lilly’s Bamlanivimab and Etesivimab which have a strong data outcome on Covid patients. In March it received US FDA approval as a potential therapy against variants of SARS-COV2.A triple combination drug — repurposed Interferon Beta-1b with Lopinavir-Ritonavir and Ribavirin — is also projected to help in reducing the viral load and symptoms. The study has found a place in the ‘The Lancet’.According to senior physician Dr Rajesh Atal Roche-Renegeron’s REGN-COV2 needs to be given at ‘entry level’ or at an early stage to ensure the spike protein of the SARS-COV2 virus doesn’t attaches itself to the cells of the host body. “The drug is to be given on priority to high risk patients like obese people elderly with comorbidities diabetic those ailing having renal issues and so on” he said.“The drug is expected to work effectively on patients with pre-exposure or early exposure to the disease” said Dr Atal and added “If one monoclonal antibody fails to act on the mutant virus the other is expected to shoot it down or reduce the risk.”Infection disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said the cocktail therapy is a good solution for families where one or more members are already infected and others too are showing symptoms. “It’s a well formulated ‘rescue therapy’ which must be administered during the incubation period before the virus gets the better of one” said Dr Shinde.He further said that it should be used prophylactically and prove good for those whose vaccine shield is breached. He hoped the cocktail drug would be effective on children above 12 years of age.Roche Pharma India’s managing director V Simpson Emmanuel has said the outpatient treatment of Covid patients with the therapy would ‘complement’ the vaccination drive in the country.Well-known senior physician Dr Nikhil Balankhe said studies have shown that the cocktail drug if introduced at an early stage is an excellent combination drug to check severe manifestation of the disease.Dr Satish Deopujari a well-known paediatrician feels the monoclonal antibodies would prove to be the game changer in treatment of Covid-9 in the coming days. “The hybrid antibody (combination of Bamlanivimab-Etesevimab and Casirivimab-Imdevimab) has 85% efficacy as compared to other anti-viral drugs in demand now” he said.Dr Deopujari warned that with major pharmaceutical players set to import the drug there could be similar chaos as seen in the case of Remdesivir Tocilizumab Itolizumab and Bevacizumab. He said the government and ICMR needs to start planning now to ensure only the needy patients gets the therapy.“This drug will have high demand in the time to come. Blackmarketing and all kinds of malpractices can’t be ruled out. The government needs to start working on a strategy immediately. What happened with Remdesivir shouldn’t become the case with monoclonal antibody therapy too” he said.He said the US is following a scoring pattern. “If you fit the criteria only then you would be given the injection. Similarly we will have to define a high-risk group. There seems to be no planning yet on how it will be rolled out” said Dr Deopujari.What is monoclonal antibody therapyA mouse is given antigen injection having tumor cellsThe tumor cells get mixed with the plasma cells already in the body to form hybridoma a hybrid cellThe hybridoma has only one task that is to produce antibodiesThese antibodies produced in huge quantity are called monoclonalThis antibody immediately kills the novel coronavirusHow it became popularFormer US president Donald Trump was one of the early patients on whom this experimental therapy was usedWhen it must be givenIdeally in the first three days or maximum up to first 10 days from onset of Covid symptomsMajor it is administered during OPD treatment in early stageNo other drug has so far same efficacy provided it is given in the first 3 or 10 daysLimitationsRecommended only for the high risk group like elderly patients and those with comorbiditesCost could be Rs1 lakh or 2lakh per dose as doctors/govt will have to triage patientsIn India indiscriminate use can’t be ruled outBenefitsPrevents hospitalization of mild to moderate patientsThree months passive protection to patientCould be given before travel or attending an event with big gatheringThe cost may go down depending on the agreement with the companyAt 85% it has highest efficacy rate as on date and prevents mortality,,,,,,,,,,,,

Undergraduate School and Degree: The Pennsylvania State University Schreyer Honors College BA and MA in Art History

Where was the last place you worked before enrolling in business school? Robert Half Creative & Marketing Recruiter

Where did you intern during the summer of 2020? Merck & Co.: Upper Gwynedd PA (Virtual due to Covid-19)

Where will you be working after graduation? Merck & Co.: Senior Specialist US Vaccines Portfolio Strategy & Implementation in Accelerated Development Program (ADP) US Commercial Rotational Program

Community Work and Leadership Roles in Business School:

* President of Consulting Association: I became President of the Consulting Association to move the proverbial needle so that the organization would be better for the next class. Over the summer leading up to the Fall of 2020 I wrote the inaugural edition of the Smeal MBA Case Book that was roughly 200 slides long containing an industry overview interview guide with frameworks and 20 practice cases. Then I formed and led a team of six second-year MBAs to act as mentors to eighteen first-year MBAs by giving mock case interviews and providing advice on recruitment. I gave presentations on the consulting industry and internal strategy opportunities. Additionally I brought in a panel of distinguished alumni in consulting firms such as Deloitte to discuss the “Day in the Life of a Consultant”. Finally in partnership with IBM and the Center for the Business of Sustainability I organized the Inaugural Smeal MBA Case Competition run by second-year MBAs for first-Year MBAs with the competition’s final round judged by IBM’s Chief Sustainability Officer.

* President of Men as Allies: Men as Allies is an affiliate organization of the Women’s MBA Association that focuses on bringing male voices into the conversation regarding gender equity and the intersectionality of race in terms of gender discrimination. The goal of the organization is to support and amplify the voices of our fellow Women MBAs. To bring these conversations to life I brought in Centre Safe a local non-profit advocacy group that promotes equity. They ran a series of case discussions that illustrated gender bias in the workplace and how that bias is often more significant when involving a woman of color. These discussions sparked nuanced conversations and even some personal sharing among the participants ultimately leading to a better collective understanding of our classmates’ varying experiences in business settings.

* Smeal Case Team Captain: Deloitte Supply Chain & Network Operations’ Supply Chain Challenge.

* Graduate Assistant: Communication Skills for Leaders a first-year MBA yearlong communications course.

* Bunton Waller Fellow: Merit based full tuition funding with a graduate stipend.

Which academic or extracurricular achievement are you most proud of during business school? I am most proud of organizing the Inaugural Smeal MBA Case Competition. As the President of the Consulting Association I wanted to increase my classmates’ competitiveness in case competitions. I decided that the best way to learn would be through experience and “pulling back the curtain” on how judges evaluate case competitions. I assembled a group of second-year MBA subject matters experts who would judge the contestants’ communication strategy and implementation. The judges would then provide the team with an extensive feedback session immediately following their presentation and after the competition concluded I sent all the teams their judges’ scorecards.

As for the case itself I collaborated with Wayne Balta the Chief Sustainability Officer at IBM to develop a case that was a real-life issue currently facing IBM’s clients regarding the credibility and veracity of carbon offsets. Wayne was kind enough to watch the competition’s final round in secret not to add un-due pressure to the first-year finalist teams. At the end of the competition we revealed that we had the real-life protagonist of the case and Wayne went on to provide some valuable insight into why he thinks the winnings team’s case was the soundest and most likely to be executed by IBM. Everyone immensely enjoyed the “pulling back the curtain” nature of the case competition and it sparked a desire in the first-year class to compete in more case competitions. Shortly after a team of first-year Smeal MBAs who had participated in the Case Competition came in second at the Deloitte Supply Chain Challenge: the first Smeal team to ever place at the competition.

What achievement are you most proud of in your professional career? My proudest professional achievement was the success I had during my internship at Merck in their US Commercial internal strategy unit known as Strategy Realization. I came into the internship with imposter syndrome having been from a primarily sales background. My project was to design the strategic plan for a data acquisition initiative to optimize sales & marketing targeting efforts for three leading vaccines brands. I led cross-functional teams consisting of data scientists digital engagement specialists and vaccine marketing leaders in ideation sessions to design effective strategies. I then condensed these strategies into a visualized optimal process flow with identified bottlenecks resource allocations and operational excellence best practices. When paired with an updated communication plan gleaned from stakeholder interviews this process flow led to an average reduced process time of 20% for further brand rollouts. I happily realized as I passed the project off to a consulting team that I could make an impact in a short time in a strategy-based role. I no longer had imposter syndrome and knew the function strategy that I came to business school to get into was the right fit for me.

Why did you choose this business school? The Smeal College of Business invited me to a weekend-long recruitment event known as WE ARE Weekend. There were several dinners and informal opportunities to network with current MBAs. At one of these dinners I sat with alums and current students talking extensively about how they all got their jobs with their classmates’ and alumni’s help. I remember a current student told me about how he and other MBAs spent hours during the weekends locked in team rooms to prepare for their upcoming interviews for the same opportunity. When one of them heard of an opportunity they would make sure that their fellow MBAs also heard of it and would even go as far to introduce them to the people they networked with for the opportunity. I was concerned about joining an MBA community rooted in competition; however I could tell from that weekend alone that Smeal was a community of collaboration that I wanted to be a part of and further.

What surprised you the most about business school? What I found most surprising about business school is it attracted people from seemingly all walks of life and professions. There is also a significant diversity of thought having seen now arguments from so many different sides. However there is this unifying characteristic of MBAs: We all want to improve ourselves. That improvement looks different for many people whether it be the soft skills or improving excel modeling but it is oddly unifying. We all have a collective understanding that we are here to become better versions of ourselves and we help each other do that by sharing our knowledge in areas that others lack. Prior to business school I thought there was an archetype of an MBA but now I realize the common thread is having a growth mindset.

What is one thing you did during the application process that gave you an edge at the school you chose? I remember sitting across the table from Mike Waldhier the Director of Admissions at the time for my final interview. I had gotten to know Mike well and I thought I had a good idea of how the interview would be. Then he hit me with this question “You know you do not have a very quantitative background and you don’t have the amount of work experience compared to our typical applicant. I am unsure this is the right program for you why do you think I should let you in?” I was slightly taken off-guard but knew this was a do-or-die type question.

I explained to him that I had started two businesses on my own one where I taught artists how to market and sell their work the other where I brokered and appraised art on behalf of collectors. I showed Mike that I had a foundational knowledge of business and experience in marketing sales and complex negotiations. Finally having been a certified fine art appraiser I relied heavily on comparable sales data to reach accurate valuations. Not only did being an appraiser allow me to acquire works of art on behalf of my clients at below market value but also allowed me to find a $20M dollar error in a valuation that I audited. All this showed Mike that despite my lack of work experience my foundational knowledge and skills developed through my ventures would make me a valuable addition to the class.

Which MBA classmate do you most admire? I admire Bitrus Baba the most because he has this uncanny ability to shift the entire conversation of the class in a positive and frankly often more feasible direction. Having worked in advisory for two Big Four companies prior to business school he had a wealth of knowledge to share with our class. Our class discussions would sometimes get into the clouds especially when it came to strategy ideation but Bitrus would ground us. Often after Bitrus shared his more pragmatic opinions the class would collectively take a step back and re-evaluate how we could develop an optimal and executable strategy. Without Bitrus our professors would have had to intervene more often during our class discussions.

How disruptive was it to shift to an online or hybrid environment after COVID hit? When it came to the disruption because of COVID-19 I must give my professors credit. Within roughly a week they adjusted their courses to fit the virtual environment and took into account all the concerns we voiced. In-class discussions were a little awkward with the Zoom hand raise feature substitute but other than that the transition to online classes was relatively seamless thanks to our professors.

Socially speaking the transition online took away the more interactive and invaluable informal elements of the program. We used to lock ourselves in team rooms with wall-to-wall white boards until the late hours of the night. Zoom team meetings seem to take longer now because of the lack of nuanced conversation and social signals experienced during in-person team meetings. Also there were no longer informal conversations with classmates in halls about companies and their interactions. Zoom happy hours replaced our weekly happy hour and any time you wanted to connect with your classmates we settled for texting.

Who most influenced your decision to pursue business in college? The person who most influenced my decision to pursue business school was my Arts Entrepreneurship Professor in Undergrad Dr. Gangi. He taught me that passion alone is not enough to run a successful business. In his classes I had to develop several business models that combined marketing finance and operations elements all areas where I had very little formal knowledge. I knew that if I was serious about being a successful serial entrepreneur I should get a business degree.

What are the top two items on your professional bucket list?

Own and operate my own art gallery. Create generational wealth from my investment portfolio.

What made Andrew such an invaluable addition to the Class of 2021?

“From the moment I first met Andrew Marshall at the initial session of my MBA elective on Strategy Implementation I could tell that he was going to be a central contributor to the success of the course. Despite our masks and social distancing I could immediately see that he was consistently upbeat and constructive; as our sessions progressed I also saw ample evidence of his deep preparation and broad-gauged managerial talents. For this particular course students must be analytically capable endowed with reliable judgment about social and human behavior and they must be able to effectively communicate their insights. Andrew excelled in the course by virtue of possessing this full slate of qualities.

In turn it is little surprise that I witnessed immense respect for Andrew from his classmates. They carefully listened to and leveraged his contributions to our case discussions. They exhibited a real fondness for the guy – even in their socially-distanced high-fives. And his group project teammates gave him rave reviews for the quantity quality and constructive style of his inputs to their collective work.

Andrew is the kind of person every B-school professor wants to teach and he’s the kind of person every MBA student wants to have as a classmate.”

Highlighted by a matchup featuring 2022 five-star Chris Livingston and 2023’s number two ranked player Mikey Williams going up against twins Amen Thompson and Ausar Thompson an enthusiastic crowd got their money’s worth.

THOMPSON TWINS CHRIS LIVINGSTON AND MIKEY WILLIAMS DO NOT DISAPPOINT

Ausar Thompson

To say that there was a buzz inside of Hy-Vee Arena for the evening’s final game between We All Can Go featuring top ten junior Chris Livingston and Mikey Williams and Florida Pro featuring potential five-star twins Amen Thompson and Ausar Thompson would be an understatement. Perhaps the biggest celebrity in high school basketball Williams drew the type of reaction that Boy Bands get when they hit the stage the gym was rocking from beginning to end.

The highly touted talents didn’t disappoint as Florida Pro opened up a 20-point lead midway through the second half and then actually had to come back for a 74-72 win in the late seconds of an action-packed game.

During the first half and through the early part of the second half it was Ausar Thompson who was the star of the show. A truly freaky athlete Thompson frustrated Livingston when matched up with him as a defender and then did just about anything he wanted on offense. Pull-up jumpers athletic drives deep threes and very creative passes. His brother Amen was a little slower to get going but had impressive moments defensively and chipped in some late offense to finish with 12 points. Currently ranked No. 42 (Ausar) and No. 45 (Amen) by 247Sports both showed why they’re going to be getting five-star consideration when we update 2022 rankings in June. They hold offers from Alabama Arizona State Florida Florida State Georgia Kansas LSU Memphis Miami Oklahoma State and USC just to name a few.

Also we can’t discuss Florida Pro without discussing Taylor Hendricks. A verbal commit to UCF the slender 6-foot-9 power forward ranks No. 133 in the industry generated Composite ranking and is just outside of the 247Sports 150. When we update he’ll be in the mix to be a four-star prospect. He’s bouncy he runs he has touch and he has big upside. He could be a huge steal for UCF.

Moving on to We All Can Go Livingston is currently ranked No. 6 by 247Sports and the 6-foot-6 wing showed why North Carolina offered earlier this week. It took him some time to get going but once the beastly scorer got going he was impossible to stop as he scored 19 of his game high 30 in the second half. He bombed from deep bounced through contact at the rim and played some serious grown man basketball.

As for Williams the five-star came out hot hitting some early jumpers and sent the crowd into a serious frenzy with a transition dunk. Late in the game he hit a huge three and had a solid night overall while scoring 14 points.

MORE FRIDAY NIGHT NOTES

Robert Dillingham

The We All Can Go/Florida Pro game wasn’t the night’s only thriller. CP3 and Team Durant locked up in as entertaining a 16U team as you will ever see. Some notes on some of the other top performers from the night.

Had his buzzer beating attempt at a game winning three gone down 2023 five-star Robert Dillingham of the CP3 16U team would have likely gone viral because of the way he immediately turned to the bench to celebrate because why not? The shot didn’t fall but that doesn’t take anything away from how electric the point guard was with the ball in his hands. Point blank he’s a scoring machine who attacks attacks attacks. He gets hot from deep finds ways to the rim and is as fun a player to watch as there is in America. He finished with 25 and was a big part of a spirited effort by a CP3 team playing with just five players (flight issues) against a loaded Team Durant 16U team. Florida Kansas North Carolina and others have offered.

If you want some toughness and a guy willing to do the dirty work then 6-foot-7 forward Amani Hansberry of Team Durant 16U is your guy. He’s crafty around the rim has strong hands and just finds ways to get things done. His late bucket that won the game against CP3 came off of pure hustle and his teammates seem to love him. George Mason LSU Mississippi State Pittsburgh Tennessee and Virginia Tech are among his offers. He finished with 12 points.

A five-star teammate of Hansberry sophomore Kwame Evans scored 11 of his own and remains a long-term bet. Standing at least 6-foot-9 maybe even a little bigger Evans is all arms and legs and the southpaw can shoot from deep. He’s not overly physical yet but he did have a key block in transition and showed a little more urgency than in the past. Evans already has in the neighborhood of 20 offers so college coaches are seeing value.

If you want a guard with some explosion in his first step and lateral quickness then sophomore point guard Jaylen Curry is your guy. Playing in a loaded CP3 16U backcourt with the previously mentioned Dillingham and four-star Aden Holloway Curry hasn’t gotten as much hype of late but he’s very good in his own right. It is hard to underestimate the value of a guy whom defenders can’t stay in front of. Florida State and Texas A&M offered last summer.

We will watch Zuby Ejiofor more throughout the weekend but the four-star junior who currently ranks No. 39 on 247Sports is an absolute monster in the paint. He looks physically ready for college hoops yesterday and has better touch than you would think given his power game. New Oklahoma head coach Porter Moser recently offered and there’s no reason he can’t play at any school in the Big 12 (or any other conference).

Last but not least Cason Wallace and Jalen Reed each had some moments for Pro Skills. A 6-foot-8 four man who plays at Mouth of Wilson (Va.) Oak Hill Reed has really started to fill out since we last saw him in person in January and if he’s being physical to go along with his skill game he can be a nice inside/out option at the four. He’s got a lot of potential. As for Wallace just when it looked like the five-star guard was going to have a quiet night he hit some high degree of difficulty shots tossed out some slick passes and caused headaches defensively. We’ll see each of these guys more throughout the weekend.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vYmlvZ3JhcGh5ZGFpbHkuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMDgvd2hhdC1pcy1qZXNzaWNhLWRpdHplbC1uZXQtd29ydGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is Jessica Ditzel Net Worth?

The expanding plaza has at least a few vacant areas and room for growth as discussions continue with retailers. A map posted March 12 on the CBRE Retail real estate page showed a vacant spot next to where Dick’s Sporting Goods will move is “proposed” to Maurice’s which is currently a women’s clothing store at the mall. The location would be next to Five Below.

The March map was taken off the website several days ago and was replaced with a map dated May 3 which does not mention Maurice's.

An employee at Maurice’s at Lycoming Mall said she was not aware of discussions to move to Lycoming Crossing. However Maurice's corporate is pushing for stores to leave mall locations according to an employee.

At the other end of the plaza is the vacant former Gap Factory store which closed in July and is now vacant. The most recent CBRE map shows that the Shoe Dept. another current Lycoming Mall tenant is proposed to go in that space. An employee at the Shoe Dept. said he was not aware of any plans to move.

The map also shows a lease is being negotiated with Marshalls to go into the former Bed Bath & Beyond store. Katie Babb spokeswoman for Marshalls said Marshalls has not announced a store opening in Muncy at this time.

In addition the latest map also shows that a lease is being negotiated with Bath & Body Works another mall store.

A Starbucks near the plaza's south entrance also is shown on the map. The Lycoming County Planning Commission approved plans to build the Starbucks at the March 18 meeting. A lease has not been signed yet. The possibility of having a Chick-fil-A restaurant on the property also was discussed at the meeting but those plans are currently on hold.

Neither CBRE nor Vision Group Ventures Lycoming Crossing's current property and asset manager would comment on plans.

Construction of Dick's Sporting Goods began in March and is coming along as the store is expected to move out of the Lycoming Mall location by September.

Old Navy moved out of the Lycoming Mall in March and into a space formerly occupied by Dressbarn and Cato's. Since the move the store has expanded their hours on week days to 9 p.m.

The Lycoming Mall has about 25 stores left including junior anchor Burlington Coat Factory Books-A-Million and several smaller stores and restaurants.

From pirates to tattoos the classic skull motifs we have mostly seen from the Paris-based brand are now supplemented by a contemporary (if not futuristic) skull-themed watch that Bell & Ross calls the BR 01 Cyber Skull.

What makes the BR 01 Cyber Skull interesting is the entirely new take on the BR 01 case and dial. The Cyber Skull uses an existing movement but is otherwise a fresh take on the skull concept. Admittedly a niche product this debut reference BR01-CSK-CE/SRB version is predictably a limited edition of 500 pieces. The movement is borrowed from the Bell & Ross BR 01 Laughing Skull watch collection which debuted an exclusive movement for Bell & Ross that features a whimsical animation. When manually wound (as this is not an automatic movement) the jaw of the skull moves up and down as though it is talking (or laughing). So if you really want to practice some ventriloquism and don’t have a puppet around your Bell & Ross Laughing Skull or Cyber Skull watch will suffice for the fun.

The movement is known as the Bell & Ross calibre BR-CAL.208 (in the Laughing Skull the different shapes of the movement have it as the BR-CAL.206). Hand-wound it features just the time with central hour and minute hands. There is no seconds hand but there is an open view of the oscillator which is located at the rare position of 12 o’clock where the skull’s “brain” should be. That’s horological romance for you… Bell & Ross doesn’t publish the performance of the movement but I’m guessing that it operates at 4Hz with about two days of power reserve. When you “open” the mouth of the skull there is a partial view of the skeletonized mainspring barrel which can serve as a rough power reserve indicator by viewing how tightly wound the spring is.

The revised BR 01 case is still mostly square but with bolder geometry and dramatically angled faceted edges. The case here is in black ceramic measuring 46.5mm-wide with 50 meters of water resistance. Bell & Ross claims that the shape of the case was inspired by the stealth F-117 fighter plane but meant for memento mori-loving fashionistas. The case has sapphire crystals on the top and bottom which are important to offer the “floating cyber skull and crossbones effect” that the dial is going for. I still appreciate the relative legibility (despite the black-on-black color palette) and more so the presence of hour markers on the dial.

Given that this new BR 01 family case is so new I think it is a bit odd that Bell & Ross didn’t give it a more distinctive name. This case concept has life beyond being a frame for a digital-style pirate skull. I think it will be interesting to see where Bell & Ross takes the direction of this look as well as how readily consumers will adopt it.

Advertising Message

Whimsical and original the Bell & Ross BR 01 Cyber Skull is a distinctive product that fits in well with the brand even if it by no means is trying to be a mainstream product. Bell & Ross did a great job creating something entirely original to them in terms of the case dial and movement and from a collector’s standpoint should at the least be admired for that. For skull-watch fans who want to play talky-talky with an “automaton” dial there is a whole other world of fun in store. Once again the reference BR01-CSK-CE/SRB Bell & Ross BR 01 Cyber Skull is a limited edition of 500 pieces and is priced at $10900 USD.

There's a Tax for That,"Is a tax on companies with big pay gaps the next $15 minimum wage?

For billionaires and some of America’s most highly paid corporate executives the pandemic has been a windfall. Over a roughly seven-month period starting in mid-March of 2020 America’s 614 billionaires — including Jeff Bezos Elon Musk and other wealthy CEOs — grew their net worth by a collective $931 billion.

The number is so large that it can only be understood in absurdities such as the fact that the top 10 billionaires have the money to pay for COVID-19 vaccinations for every person on the planet.

For ordinary Americans there hasn’t been a windfall. Recent studies show the decadeslong trend of flat wages continues unabated. The growing pay gap between corporate CEOs and their rank-and-file employees has been seen as evidence of growing inequality. Recent studies have shown that gap dramatically increasing.

While the drive to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour has been one response to income inequality it is not the only game in town.

San Francisco Treat

Last November San Francisco voters passed by an almost 2-1 margin Proposition L known popularly as the “Overpaid Executive Tax.” Under this new law any company that has an executive that makes more than 100 times the pay rate of its “typical local worker” will be charged 0.1 percent on its annual business taxes; top earners making more than 200 times their typical local worker would pay a surcharge of 0.2 percent. This formula increases the surcharge by 0.1 percent per factor of 100 topping out at 0.6 percent for companies where top executives make more than 600 times the pay of their rank and file.

“Companies have a choice. They can either narrow their pay gaps to avoid the taxes or they can dig in their heels and keep having very large gaps between CEO and worker pay” said Sarah Anderson project director of the Global Economy Project at the Institute of Policy Studies a left-leaning think tank. “That will mean they owe more revenue which the government can use to invest in urgent social needs.”

Bay Area companies have some of the widest pay gaps. A few:

At Intel Corp. CEO Robert Swan’s 2019 compensation was $66.9 million against median employee compensation of $96300 a ratio of 695-to-1.

At Ross Stores Inc. CEO Barbara Rentler made $12 million in 2019 against median employee compensation of $11356 a ratio of 1059-to-1.

Alphabet Inc. Google’s parent company has the greatest discrepancy. CEO Sundar Pichai made $280.6 million in 2019 against median employee compensation of $258708 a ratio of 1085-to-1.



Anderson cited the success of California’s excise tax on cigarettes in reducing smoking rates and health care costs as a model for this pay-gap law. But San Francisco was not the first West Coast city to adopt this type of measure.

In 2016 Portland passed a law that levied a 10 percent surtax on firms with a pay gap ratio of greater than 100-to-1 and a 25 percent surcharge on firms with a pay gap ratio of more than 250-to-1. But Portland’s version only applies to publicly owned companies while San Francisco’s rule applies to both private and public firms.

Is It Just Virtue Signaling?

Like most major policy reforms the pay-gap tax is not lacking in critics. The Libertarian Party of San Francisco came out against Proposition L claiming it is ineffective.

“It doesn’t necessarily actually have that great an impact but sort of makes it look like [elected officials] are doing something. It is what they call virtue signaling” said San Francisco Libertarian Party spokesperson Starchild (born Chris Fox).

He says it would be like if the San Francisco City Council passed a resolution to honor George Floyd instead of pursuing policies that made the San Francisco Police Department more accountable.

While conceding that income inequality is a problem he felt that more intrusive government regulations would only make inequality worse arguing that government tends to favor big business and makes life more difficult for ordinary stockholders.

Other more traditionally conservative critics are even more harsh. Pro-business political groups like the Chamber of Commerce and the San Francisco Taxpayers Association blame California’s high taxes and excess regulations and not economic inequality for the state’s sputtering economy. Because the labor force in the San Francisco metro area declined by 4.5 percent between February and August of 2020 and San Francisco reported only 800 news jobs created in September critics say now is the worst time for new regulations.

Richie Greenberg thinks it is not strange that there would be wage gaps between top corporate executives and their rank-and-file employees given their vastly different responsibilities.

“It is bizarre to think that they should be close” said Greenberg a business adviser and political advocate who was the official spokesperson of the “No on L” campaign.

His argument is that you can’t compare a shoe salesperson interfacing with the public to a CEO managing global operations involving billions of dollars. Besides he said the proposition has a massive loophole: Companies could get around the tax by replacing low-paid employees on the payroll with low-paid employees working for private contractors.

“One easy trick to bypass the tax and grow revenue; pay your employees more. Our highest paid exec. makes 3x our median worker. After we raised our minimum wage revenue tripled.” — Dan Price Gravity Payments CEO

He also predicted the expected revenue generated by the tax would be offset by the tax revenue lost by companies leaving pointing to an analysis by the Controller’s Office for the City and County of San Francisco.

Advocates disagree citing Portland as a success.

“They [Portland pay-equality advocates] had a certain amount they wanted to raise for a homeless program. They designed the tax in a very modest way to raise that amount of money. … For the people who were the main backers of it it has worked out exactly as they expected” said Anderson.

Anderson also countered claims that companies would simply outsource low-wage employees to beat the tax saying that most big companies have maxed out on outsourcing and subcontracting. She also challenged skeptics to name a company that left Portland due to the 2016 surtax.

The San Francisco Libertarian Party’s Starchild concedes that though the pay-gap tax by itself may not be a decisive factor in forcing companies out of California it will have an impact nonetheless.

“It’s not any one of these government things that comes along in and of itself that is usually going to have such a monumental negative impact. More of a cumulative total” said Starchild. Greenberg concurred noting that Proposition L was just one of a string of 2020 city ballot initiatives raising taxes.

But not all capitalists were against Proposition L. Dan Price CEO of Gravity Payments is famous for dropping his salary from $1.1 million a year to $70000 and establishing $70000 as the minimum wage for his 120 employees. He had a suggestion for San Francisco firms after the proposition passed.

“One easy trick to bypass the tax and grow revenue; pay your employees more. Our highest paid exec. makes 3x our median worker. After we raised our minimum wage revenue tripled” tweeted Price.

The Next Big Thing?

There already has been legislation introduced in nine states concerning pay disparities (California Connecticut Hawaii Illinois Massachusetts Minnesota New York Rhode Island and Washington). Some of the legislation is similar to Portland’s and San Francisco’s pay-gap surtax.

Other states have proposed bills granting preferential treatment to companies bidding on state contracts that have pay disparities of less than 25-to-1 between their CEO and median worker or alternately banning state subsidies and grants for companies with more than a 100-to-1 pay disparity.

There has been similar legislation introduced at the federal level as well as a proposal to prohibit stock buybacks for companies with pay disparities of more than 150-to-1.

Like the $15 minimum wage a pay-gap tax is gathering momentum. Whether it will begin to address income inequality is an outstanding question. So too is whether affected companies will find workarounds or simply relocate. San Francisco and Portland have once again set a progressive precedent; what remains to be seen is whether it will become popular in other parts of the country.

“PCR test 14 day quarantine PCR test charter flight PCR test vaccine quarantine and PCR test” Bayley said.

The company says the law signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis is at odds with guidelines from federal health authorities that would let cruise ships sail in US waters if nearly all passengers and crew members are vaccinated.

“It is a classic state-versus-federal-government issue” said Norwegian's CEO Frank Del Rio. “Lawyers believe that federal law applies and not state law but I’m not a lawyer. And we hope that this doesn’t become a legal football or a political football.”

The company owns Norwegian Cruise Line Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises.

Del Rio told analysts during the company's quarterly earnings call Thursday that if the company can’t operate in Florida it can go to other states or the Caribbean “for ships that otherwise would have gone to Florida ... we certainly hope it doesn't come to that.”

Del Rio said the company is still discussing the matter with DeSantis’ office.

Last month DeSantis signed an order banning businesses from requiring customers to show proof of vaccination and prohibiting state agencies from issuing so-called vaccine passports that document COVID-19 vaccinations and test results. This week he signed legislation that includes the provision about businesses and gives him the power to overrule local measures related to the pandemic such as mask mandates.

DeSantis said the order and the legislation were matters of preserving individual freedom and privacy. On Friday the governor's office did not immediately respond to the Norwegian Cruise Line CEO's comments.

Norwegian aims to have all passengers and crew vaccinated. Guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would let ships skip practice voyages and begin trips with paying customers if 98% of the crew and 95% of passengers are vaccinated and ships take other measures to limit the risk of transmitting the virus that causes COVID-19.

Cruise lines have been barred from sailing in U.S. waters or stopping at U.S. ports since March 2020 early in the pandemic. Some are slowly resuming trips in other countries and requiring that all passengers on those cruises be vaccinated.

The companies are pushing the CDC to let them return to the US this summer although none of the major companies — Norwegian Royal Caribbean Group and Carnival Corp. — have announced any US cruises.

Del Rio said the path to resuming US cruises is “a bit rockier and a bit steeper” than expected and he said a mid-summer restart “could be in jeopardy.”

Norwegian said after the market closed Thursday that it lost $1.37 billion in the first quarter after losing $4 billion last year. The company said however that bookings have picked up raising hopes for a recovery in early 2022.

Its shares rose about 2% in Friday afternoon trading.

Still things are looking up with the huge announcements about the upcoming Disney Wish with its rooms unique dining experiences one-of-a-kind entertainment and more! But something else new may also be in the works for the Disney Cruise Line next year too.

The Orlando Sentinel has reported that the Disney Cruise Line is looking to bring a port to Fort Lauderdale year-round starting in 2022. The cruise line has already requested an agreement with Port Everglades as they wait for Broward County to approve it.

If the deal goes through Fort Lauderdale would be the first year-round ship outside of Port Canaveral where Disney Cruise Line has its headquarters. Close by the Disney Cruise Line has sailed seasonally from Port Miami but the contract ends in 2024.

Previously Disney has only docked at Port Everglades during storms but the agreement between the cruise line and the port states that the ship would carry about 3500 people. The port would benefit Broward County as it brought in more tourism generating more jobs as well as additional state and local tax dollars in the South Florida city. The Broward County Commission will discuss the Disney Cruise Line and Port Everglades deal during its meeting on May 18th.

Jonathan Daniels the chief executive and port director at Port Everglades has stated “Adding Disney Cruise Line to the Port Everglades fleet along with the Royal Caribbean Group and Carnival Corporation would diversify our portfolio and create a little more magic for our guests and the community.”

The Norwegian Breakaway was the first vessel to include the exclusive suite enclave currently known as The Haven by Norwegian.

The concept has since been expanded to other vessels such as the new Norwegian Encore. Other than lavish cabins the Haven includes different private facilities which vary from ship to ship. On newer vessels the area includes a pool deck a lounge a restaurant an observation lounge and even a library.

Craig Zahler’s Gangster Thriller in Cannes (EXCLUSIVE),"Writer-director S. Craig Zahler (“Bone Tomahawk”) is set to reunite with his “Dragged Across Concrete” and “Brawl in Cell Block 99” star Vince Vaughn and Oscar winner Adrien Brody (“The Pianist”) for upcoming crime thriller “The Bookie & the Bruiser.”

Anton will introduce the film to international distributors at the upcoming Marche du Film in Cannes. UTA Independent Film Group and Range Media Partners arranged the financing and will be representing the North American distribution rights.

Set in 1959 New York “The Bookie & the Bruiser” follows a pensive Jewish fellow named Rivner and an oversized Italian-American tough named Boscolo from the Lower East Side both of whom served overseas during WWII and returned changed men who no longer fit inside the lives they’d left behind. Uninterested in taking orders from bosses or playing by the rules of polite society the two friends partner up as a bookmaker and an enforcer and create an illicit gambling operation that proves to be very profitable though risky and their situation gets rather sticky when they find themselves stuck between a powerful Irish gang and the Mafia. The film is currently in pre-production and is planned for a fall 2024 shoot.

Anthony Katagas — an Oscar winner for “12 Years a Slave” and one of the most prolific producers in U.S. indie film having worked across titles including “Lost City of Z” “Ad Astra” “Uncut Gems” and “Armageddon Time” — will produce via his Keep Your Head Productions alongside Dave Caplan. C2 Motion Picture Group is fully financing the project.

“We are thrilled to be working with the visionary S. Craig Zahler on this action-packed tale of a searing conflict between the Irish-American and Italian Mafias in New York and see Vince and Adrien team up in this very unique power charged film” said Anton CEO Sébastien Raybaud.

“I’m honored and humbled to be working with one of my favorite filmmakers” added Caplan. “A S. Craig Zahler gangster movie is something I’m dying to watch.”

Anton’s current film slate includes Claude Barras’ animated feature “Savages” set to world premiere in Cannes’ official selection and “Memoir of a Snail” a stop motion animation from Oscar winning writer-director Adam Elliott (“Mary & Max”) which will make its market debut in Cannes ahead of a world premiere at the Annecy Film Festival. Anton will also debut an exclusive preview of 40 minutes of footage from “Night of the Zoopocalypse” a CGI animated feature from from the studios behind “Despicable Me” “Ice Age: Collision Course” and “Paw Patrol.” Other Anton titles include the heist thriller “Fuze” from the director David Mackenzie starring Aaron Taylor Johnson as well as Martin Campbell’s “Cleaner” starring Daisy Ridley Clive Owen and Taz Skylar.

C2 Motion Picture Group recently co-financed a number of high-profile Paramount films including “Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning” “Transformers Rise Of The Beasts” “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” and “Babylon.” C2 also financed and produced the highly anticipated “Longlegs” which Neon is releasing this summer “In The Grey” with Lionsgate and Black Bear “Goodrich” with Ketchup Entertainment “The End We Start From” with Anton and Republic Pictures and “Azrael” with Republic Pictures.

Special to Naples Daily News

Theory Design is debuting the interior design for Theory Design’s and Seagate Development Group’s two-story corporate headquarters at 9921 Interstate Commerce Drive. Located just off Alico Road and seconds from I-75 in Fort Myers the 13000-square-foot facility is a direct result of an exterior and interior concept by Theory Design Seagate and Joe McHarris at McHarris Planning & Design in Bonita Springs. Currently it is the home base for over 60 employees and personnel whose space reflects both the present and future work of both companies.

A timeless sense of strength and modern influence is detected the second you enter the parking lot. This reflects the core values within the building and is apparent in the exterior’s modern lines expansive windows massive black steel brackets and highly distinguishable canopies. The exterior color palette ranges from Morning Fog to Serious Gray and Heron Plume.

The forward-thinking approach to the headquarters is carried into and throughout the streamlined fully functional interior spaces as well as complemented by smart technology like smartboards and Surface Pro laptops. The hotel-like reception area includes reverse soffit ceilings LED cove lighting a stainless-steel elevator concrete-like tile flooring a custom marble and ebony wood reception desk and sleek black baseboards. Minimalist pendant lighting hangs over the desk and in front of floor-to-ceiling walnut-finish panels as well as hidden storage cabinetry. Low-back chairs were recently added to the lobby to reflect a comfortable atmosphere. The first floor continues with three conference rooms that offer linen-like wall covering and walnut-wood-paneled walls private offices and an oversized training center. They all feature floor-to-ceiling glass partition walls and doors that prompt natural lighting modern-style carpet tile in Dark Steel wide windows with solar screen shades and walnut-finish cabinetry and panels that reflect the reception space. Collaboration areas range from a generously sized lounge area to a kitchen a café-inspired coffee bar and a breakroom complete with Bosch appliances flatscreen televisions Pompeii quartz countertops and other high-end finishes. Restrooms throughout the building provide Light Grey matte-finished tile Pompeii quartz countertops Kohler plumbing and wall coverings.

The second floor is reserved for executive offices and a full-service design studio with 11-foot ceilings project tables a complete library of samples and an incomparable view of a never-ending lake. Finishes mimic the other collaborative areas. Much like the first level it features floor-to-ceiling windows and offices surrounded by glass partition walls and plenty of natural light as well as a kitchen a café-inspired coffee bar and a breakroom with the same upgrades and finishes as downstairs. Details exclusive to the upper level include a living-room-type lounge off the elevator complete with wall covering. An all-encompassing Board Room presents a large custom walnut conference table reverse-soffit ceilings with a walnut insert a wine bar with a full-size Sub-Zero wine refrigerator ebony cabinetry by Fusion Pompeii quartz countertops and a Kohler sink and faucet. The Board Room opens to a balcony with modern bar tables and stools that overlook the tranquil lake. Designer and Seagate partner conference rooms display flatscreen TVs for presentations and meetings. Private offices for partners and managers are lined with elegant and decorative wallpaper and reflect each executive’s unique style via dark furniture light collectibles and study-style desks.

This creative step into an office of the future was taken ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic. However the open-concept design allows all team members to work in a safe socially distant environment while encouraging them to collaborate and engage as a way of executing forward-thinking ideas. The design was inspired by the establishment of Theory Design in 2019 giving Theory Design and Seagate the invaluable ability to come together on projects and accommodate their rapid growth.

In addition to creating the interior for its and Seagate’s corporate office Theory Design is completing the interior for the furnished Revana Monterey II and Sonoma model homes in the Isola Bella neighborhood at Talis Park (Naples) as well as the furnished Bal Harbour Beacon Sunny Isles and Cape Romano models at Hill Tide Estates (Boca Grande). The Revana and Monterey II models will be complete in Spring 2022 while the Sonoma model will be complete in Summer 2022. The Bal Harbour model will be complete this autumn while the Beacon and Cape Romano models will be complete in 2022.

Amidst the pandemic overwhelming the capacity of many hospital systems malicious hackers have been quick to target healthcare providers and medical agencies. These cyber-attacks have hit both the United States and Europe in recent months serving as a reminder for organizations to closely review their information security posture during these times of uncertainty.

Despite certain attacker groups stating their intent to refrain from targeting healthcare organizations for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis publicly reported cyber-attacks included a ransomware attack on the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District in the United States and the downing of critical systems at Brno University Hospital in the Czech Republic. In addition attacks against the World Health Organization have more than doubled while the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was hit by an attempted DDoS attack.

Attack surface is expanding

Hospitals and healthcare organizations were an attractive target even before the coronavirus pandemic. Patient records have almost everything an attacker needs in a single record to carry out sophisticated insurance fraud schemes purchase medical supplies or drugs and/or commit other types of fraud including outright identity theft. Medical records are lucrative targets and are expensive assets in the dark market.

The deployment of new devices—especially those categorized as IoT that use wireless networks and sensors to collect and exchange information—is a double-edged sword. While these devices offer medical environments tremendous capabilities to care for patients and increase efficiencies each device increases an organization’s attack surface.

Compliance challenges

Adding to the complexity of these security challenges are compliance and regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and NIS Directivethat are typically enacted to protect systems and sensitive data. However since they frequently evolve to keep pace with information technology industry influences and new threats to systems and data healthcare organizations face multiple moving targets for managing controls and meeting requirements.

For example in the UK hospitals and other healthcare entities of the National Health System (NHS) that are using digital services are responsible for ensuring they meet the minimum standards in the areas of network security and data protection.

Requirements for network protection are described in the NCSC Cloud Security Principles and in the 10 steps to cybersecurity guidance. Healthcare organizations can demonstrate compliance with these requirements by taking a self-assessment like the Cyber Essentials.

In the field of data protection healthcare organizations need to comply with the requirements of Data Protection Act of 2018 which transposed GDPR into the UK legislation. To demonstrate compliance hospitals and other NHS entities need to consider the 12 steps detailed by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).

All this said securing patient customer and organizational data must be a top priority. The high price for patient records combined with new and growing vulnerabilities provide a great impetus for cybercriminals to attack.

How to Keep Your Healthcare Organization Safe

There are several key measures to follow that help lower the risks of breaches and keep your company’s and customers’ data safe.

Build a risk-aware culture. This means: Thoroughly examine and determine where security risks lie in your organization. Educate and communicate with employees to help them understand how they can help close the gaps. Implement the right tools that continuously monitor and identify vulnerabilities as well as alert employees so that your organization can act quickly to reduce the risks.

Implement foundational controls and basic security hygiene. According to SANS implementing the first six CIS Controls provide a highly effective and efficient level of defense against the majority of real-world attacks. They also help to create the necessary foundation for dealing with more advanced attacks.

Automate all security and compliance efforts. This helps to: Discover and profile all business-critical assets such as patient care systems medical devices and payment systems. Quickly repair configurations errors. Adjust security controls based on system changes and business impact. Monitor measure and report compliance with security and privacy requirements.

Manage incidents with intelligence to help your organization to respond more quickly. To do this: Implement intelligent analytics to help monitor operations. Implement automated response capabilities. Integrate next generation threat intelligence solutions with change detection for advanced threat detection and response.



Good Security Delivers Effective Compliance

The solution to the unprecedented cyber threat problem that healthcare organizations face is to implement foundational controls that integrate into other solutions to proactively respond to threats. If an organization has implemented good security processes and controls they could be well on their way to meeting multiple compliance and/or security standards.

Tripwire supports many compliance mandates (including HIPAA and FDA) as well as guidelines from NIST. That support combined with Tripwire’s advanced cybersecurity and compliance solutions gives you proven industry-recognized security and the ability to meet almost any compliance mandate. All while helping you detect and respond to any threat to your organization’s—and customers’—data.

I even made a full article on how upgrading to an SSD vastly improved the performance of an old and sluggish laptop.

In this article it’s all about this new storage device that caters not only to me as a creative but also to every other professional who always relies on large external drives for work on-the-go. Wrote five reasons why I find the Seagate Ultra Touch SSD one of the best (if not the best) external storage device you can use for work and play.

1. Chic and stylish

Unlike other external HDDs that are mostly made up of plastic Seagate’s Ultra Touch SSD is made from textile that resembles a woven fabric making it look and feel sleek.

It comes in two basic colors: White and Black. Obviously I got the black one. But if neither is your cup of tea there are special Camo and Sam Larson editions for the One Touch version — especially if you prefer louder designs over the minimal-looking. Regardless of what color you choose they all look modern and barely looks like a typical external storage device.

2. Compact and pocketable

Seagate’s Ultra Touch SSD thinnest point is just at 10mm. That’s slimmer than most smartphones today. When held you’ll barely notice it’s there because it weighs exactly at 0.065 kilograms or just 65 grams! If you come to think of it conventional hard disk drives weigh around 170 to 220 grams. It may not sound a lot but you’ll definitely feel the heft if you hold them with your hands.

Due to the lack of mechanical parts such as large spinning disks this makes Seagate’s Ultra Touch SSD ultra lightweight and compact — especially that it has immovable parts (chips) inside it. While I don’t recommend to just put this storage device inside your jeans’ pockets as it’s not totally built for butt pressure this external SSD is greatly pocketable.

For real-world comparison I’ve managed to place it side-by-side with my old laptop’s 500GB 2.5-inch SATA HDD (Hard Disk Drive)…

…and also compared its thin form factor against my extra thicc 4TB External HDD.

For another comparison I also have another 2TB external HDD that’s as thicc as the previously mentioned hard drive.

Its size is quite close to my 65W USB-C PD power brick…

and quite smaller than my debit card.

Finally here’s how it looks like versus three different coins from Singapore Taiwan and the Philippines.

3. Speedy and reliable performance

On paper Seagate is confident that the Ultra Touch SSD will reach up to 400MB/s of write speed. True to its words it’s able to give me more than 300MB/s under a huge stress test. Others might say it doesn’t stick to its promise but devices like this don’t really reach the maximum limit — just like how it works in cars other devices and even human beings with utmost limits.

The image above shows a huge speed gap between my external HDD compared to Seagate’s SSD. It may not matter to most users but for video editors and gamers fast read and write speeds are everything.

4K videos are harder to read on slower disk drives. No wonder why a video editor app is sluggish even if your laptop/rig has all the best chipset and memory on board. Investing on a fast SSD like the Ultra Touch SSD is a great solution for that.

Even gamers need fast drivers since most games run on 2K/4K resolution with maximum settings possible. The external SSD will not only load games faster it can also be opened in other laptops as long as you figured out how to correctly install games in external drives.

I also tried comparing disk speeds versus two MacBook Pros with an internal non-removable SSD. While they’re pretty far from what Seagate can offer it’s still a huge feat considering an external SSD can achieve great feats of read and write speeds that regular disk drives can’t even do.

4. Utmost compatibility

Out of the box the Seagate Ultra Touch SSD is already formatted to exFAT. This means you don’t have to worry about storage platform incompatibilities. Usually external disk drives come in NTFS format — which is limited to Windows systems. Other drives are specified for Mac. Thus the Mac OS Extended format.

Whether that may be Windows macOS Linux a smart/Android TV or even an Android smartphone the Seagate Ultra Touch SSD will work wonders since exFAT can be read by most devices. Such file format is the most accessible across all platforms whether that is for reading or writing files.

Upon my usage I tested it with the Galaxy S21 Ultra as it successfully detected the drive and was able to show its contents through Seagate’s SSD Touch app. File Manager works as well for copying and pasting several data. As long as your device supports USB On-The-Go the portable drive would actually work.

5. Future-ready

Other than being available to almost every device Seagate made sure that it’s safe for future use with the inclusion of a braided USB-A cable plus a USB-A to USB-C adapter. It’s “future-proof” in a sense that most upcoming devices will be shipped with USB-C anyway. While there’s still the USB-A plug for backwards compatibility with older machines.

BONUS: Free subscriptions

Upon any purchase of Seagate’s Ultra Touch SSD (or even HDD) you’ll get free limited subscriptions with Mylio Create for one year. Mylio Create is an app that stores all your photos in one online library. Their system also organizes your photos depending on their visual story.

There’s even the free Adobe Creative Cloud Photography plan (Photoshop and Lightroom) for two (2) months. If you’ll try to list it down that’s a great saving especially if your a creative or a content creator who relies on such apps. Adobe’s Creative Cloud plan alone will cost you thousands of dollars. If you’re new to the scene this is a great way for you to test out their products while trying to build your creative portfolio.

Pricing

The Seagate Ultra Touch SSD is currently available in only two storage options: 500GB and 1TB. Pricing varies per region and is available through Shopee or Amazon at these links in Singapore Malaysia Thaila nd Philippines Indonesia Vi etnam and India but in the Philippines the 500GB version is priced at PhP 7999 while the 1TB version retails for PhP 9999. While this portable storage device is pocketable it’s definitely not pocket-friendly for most consumers.",,,,,,

The following article translated from the Spanish version on Pie de Página looks at the women-led struggle against the passing of a U.S. company’s gas pipeline through Yaqui territory in so-called Mexico. It also touches on the case of Yaqui political prisoner Fidencio Aldama serving a 15+ year sentence related to resistance to the pipeline. For more information on Fidencio visit fidencioaldama.org.

The gas pipeline was already a foregone conclusion at least that’s what the company the subsidiary and the government of Sonora thought. They were wrong. Yaqui women narrate how they have stopped this project.

Loma de Bácum Sonora: A gigantic metal pipe can be seen at the bottom of a hole in the earth. The family of Carmen García look into the hole which was dug by the people of Loma de Bácum to remove the gas pipeline.

The people used an excavator they seized from the company IEnova affiliate of the United States transnational Sempra Energy. The company was building the gas pipeline without the approval of those who live there. A consultation was never carried out. So after an assembly the entire community went to where the pipeline was being laid. There they excavated and cut out with a blowtorch nearly ten kilometers of pipeline which they then took to Ciudad Obregón to sell as scrap metal.

“The company complained made a fuss and sued. If you continue building the pipeline we told them we are going to continue selling it as scrap metal” says Guadalupe Maldonado Flores a Yaqui who has accompanied territorial defense efforts of the traditional guard of Loma de Bácum.

In August 2017 they began to remove the pipeline but the energy megaproject began in 2012 with the signing of a contract between the then-president Enrique Peña and the company. Construction began in 2013. They failed to carry out a consultation with the Indigenous peoples yet they knew that the pipeline route crossed Yaqui territory.

The proposal was to build “Gasoducto Sonora” for the importation of gas through Agua Prieta. In 2016 the company arrived to the eight Yaqui towns to promote the project offering money water purifiers and even new pickup trucks. IEnova had the acceptance of seven of the eight Yaqui towns. In Loma de Bácum it was impossible.

Francisca Vazquez Carmen’s mother had a dream in the sacred Bakatete territory. After this dream the women got organized. Casilda was still alive a well-known Yaqui woman and elder who dedicated herself to convene and organize the women in order to stop what the transnational company was doing. It was women who led the land defense.

“Ever since we were little our ancestors our grandparents who never studied who spoke our language told us that our lands were going to be taken. ‘The government says: everyone will study. Don’t take their side. From today you defend your territory. We are not going to be here anymore and the day that the government wants it will have you in its sights’” says Francisca.

The reaction in the community when they were told about the gas pipeline was to ask what would happen if the pipeline exploded being so close to the inhabitants of the community.

“We remember the words of our ancestors our grandparents that we were going to lose our territories because our own Yaqui brothers were not going to denounce it.” Like that women from at least four of the eight Yaqui towns began to organize at the invitation of Francisca’s close friend Casilda who died in 2020 from cancer in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. Casilda was a woman dedicated to singing at the church in Loma de Bácum. She committed herself to the struggle against violence toward women and was always an advocate for women’s rights.

Thanks to the work of the women’s group from Bácum they won an injunction and the judge suspended construction in June 2017 also ordering the removal of the pipeline. But the company continued construction until the community of Loma de Bácum stopped it themselves.

Now every October 21 they celebrate the most recent defense of territory. They prepare food for the entire community and they also do the deer dance with traditional music. The goal is that this day of resistance sticks in the memory of the youth of the children.

Also to serve as a reminder of these acts of self-defense the community left the burned cars which belonged to the pipeline company in the central plaza in front of the church and traditional guard.

According to an investigation from Avispa Midia IEnova has investments of 8.769 billion US dollars in Mexico and a history of abuses. The company accused the Yaqui people of being a “criminal group” that carried out acts of “vandalism.”

Inhabitants of this town and of the other seven Yaqui towns are now denouncing the entrance of mining companies for exploration in their territory. The traditional guard of Loma de Bácum detected at least seven incursions in the mountains of Bakatete seeking to begin mining projects.

“We have always been alert; now even more so” assured Guadalupe.

Freedom of a Political Prisoner

A week after the Yaqui community of Loma de Bácum stopped the machinery a group of armed Yaquis the majority from Loma de Guamúchil entered the community to wreak havoc. Different testimonies say that the company paid them. The objective of the group was to come into town and replace the traditional authority that refused the gas pipeline in order to impose an authority that would accept the megaproject.

The day that the violent group arrived in Loma de Bácum there were many people in the community more than 600. The group said that they came to dialogue to have a meeting says Francisca a woman with a firm tone wearing a purple shawl and a traditional Yaqui skirt who takes care of her father who has diabetes. She appears younger than she is. She is a woman devoted to singing in the community church.

Carmen’s family recognizes that other communities accepted the route of the pipeline but the traditional authorities didn’t consult with their respective people to whom they are responsible. They only made a deal.

In Loma de Bácum rather the people and the traditional guard decided to defend Yaqui territory both from mining as well as from the gas pipeline. Part of that work is strengthening their traditions language and productive activities.

But on October 21 2016 there were gunshots. There were two attacks on the same day in the first attack Cruz Buitimea of Loma de Guamúchil died.

“There were women there like my aunt” says Carmen. “My aunt says that she was carrying sticks of firewood. She took them to the men so that they could defend themselves with the sticks and stones that she gathered in her blouse because they didn’t have anything with which to defend themselves.” The violent group arrived armed and Loma de Bácum defended itself in response explains Carmen while drinking coffee with her family in the backyard of her house where her two kids play and sing songs in the Jiaki language.

She says that when they came to attack for the second time that day was when they blamed Fidencio from Cruz Buitimea’s death. “He confidently told them: ‘If you think that I killed him we will see how that plays out legally.’” Carmen accentuates “And you see how corrupt this system is this law and this government.” At that moment Fidencio was pushed up against a tree. They beat him. He ran. They chased him but he managed to escape by hiding in the brush.

Fidencio is 32 years old. He is originally from Loma de Guamúchil although he lives with his family in Loma de Bácum. He has served various roles in the community. He has openly spoken out against the gas pipeline.

When some of his relatives received money from the IEnova energy company Fidencio said to them “Why are you taking money if that money is going to eventually disappear in exchange for territory that will always be here territory that is supposed to be ours. But if you are selling it you are not going to have it for your families.”

“They said that it was my husband.” The two people that accused him presented a video where Fidencio is carrying a gun the guns used by the community police of Loma de Bácum which was Fidencio’s position at the time. The guns belonging to the traditional guard are .45 caliber. Different than the caliber of the bullet that was found in the deceased Cruz which was a .22 caliber. This is not mentioned in the case file.

According to witnesses on that day it was people from other Yaqui towns who violently entered the community alongside those from Loma de Guamúchil who murdered Cruz. “The idea was that there would need to be deaths in order to justify the entrance of the state so that the police would enter” Guadalupe Flores tells us as we take a tour of the agroecological garden of the Yaqui town.

“AMLO says that in the Fourth Transformation there are no political prisoners. Well how are you going to say say that there are no political prisoners if my husband is a political prisoner? Then what does that make my husband?” says Carmen with anger in her eyes. She then gets up to prepare tortillas and to continue talking in the backyard of her house.

The Kidnapping of Fidencio

Six days later Sonoran prosecutors arrived to interview members of the town’s traditional guard about the murder. It was late at night. It was thought they were interviewing everyone in the community. They questioned them one by one. When Fidencio showed up they restrained him. He came to give a statement but they stopped everything and took him away. Along with him they took the translator and lawyer Anabela Carlón who they released before arriving at the prosecutor’s office.

Carmen didn’t know that they had taken Fidencio.

There was no arrest warrant nor were any reasons given as to why he was being taken. Since then he has been imprisoned with a number of irregularities.

Pie de Página has his case file.

Anabela filed a motion documenting the violations committed by the prosecutors. This was not included in the case file. When he went to give his statement before being taken away they tied him up completely. When they arrived at Obregón the charging documents had already been prepared the day before and they already had Fidencio Aldama’s voter ID card. But the judge dismissed Anabela’s motion. In short they have suggested in a veiled manner that Fidencio’s freedom would be granted in exchange for the passage of the pipeline. Fidencio has consistently rejected this offer.

For Carmen and her family what they did was not an arrest it was a kidnapping. Fidencio wasn’t shown an arrest warrant until he arrived at the then-State Attorney General’s Office based in Ciudad Obregón. Without the presence of lawyers or translators he was processed.

“Why didn’t they show me the [arrest warrant] in front of my family in front of the town’s authorities in front of the tribe? Why here that is where the mestizos are?” wondered Fidencio. And they forced him to sign the arrest warrant.

Fidencio Aldama has been imprisoned for four years. His eldest son Ian performs the deer dance at the town’s festivals to demand his release.

David Guadalupe Valenzuela his most recent lawyer died of Covid.

In the privacy they barely have during visits at the prison in Obregón Fidencio told Carmen “If I had shot at Cruz I would have hit someone else not just him because I had a .45.” In that conversation he reminded her that it is forbidden to shoot at people only into the sky to scare them.

Since his imprisonment Carmen and her family have organized support campaigns have changed lawyers four times have raised funds held meetings and visited other communities in resistance to inform them about her husband’s case. In seeking his freedom Fidencio has given his all from the inside from campaigns with other prisoners sending letters to the governor and president and going on hunger strike.

“The pipeline should not pass through here nor in any part of the eight towns because the lands are communal they belong to everyone. When Loma de Bácum defends its part it defends all of Yaqui territory and that’s how it should be and that is how it has historically been recognized” explains Carmen in front of her mother and children.

For Carmen and her family justice as presented by the INPI [National Institute of Indigenous Peoples] or the federal government is not legitimate as the cancellation of the pipeline is not on their agenda.

Carmen remembers that in the discussions held with these institutions to create a plan of justice for her community those who attended were dual authorities and not the legitimate authorities of Loma de Bácum so her town is not being taken into consideration. “They don’t care about our authorities our town our people our tribe.” This means completely ignoring a community says Carmen.

For her removing the pipes from her territory not just Loma de Bácum but all Yaqui territory is what justice looks like. As well justice is freedom for Fidencio Aldama.

“We beat the State we took down the pipeline by legal social and physical means because we know that the State takes license with their actions. The State doesn’t care about the laws it enforces them at its convenience. Here we got an injunction against the pipeline and they came in despite the injunction. The government didn’t take any action against the company on the contrary it protected it” denounces Guadalupe Flores as he walks in the garden.

“Now [the company] wants to negotiate again… but no more. Here they already started off on the wrong foot and its going to be more of the same and they’re not getting in” he says. And he states that neither this company nor any mining company will enter Yaqui territory.

“The company has to be paid because the pipeline is inactive. Well you pay for it not us. Who’s in charge? Now you already knew what you were going to face. Tighten your belt and pay them. Who is forcing you to pay? There’s an international treaty send them there over a pipe. Because if we start with those international treaties tell the gringos to give back the territory they took let’s see if they hold up. Oh right they enforce them when it’s convenient. And we are not your subjects.”

Agroecological Planting

Guadalupe Flores has a mischievous smile but his entire Yaqui demeanor is imposing. He enjoys walking through the agroecological garden created in Loma de Bácum a few meters from the pipeline. In the distance one can see the Ferromex train pass. Guadalupe explains that during the Porfiriato there was also repression for opposing the train. Later it was used to deport them to Yucatán to be slaves on the agave plantations.

“We were born here and we grew up here; these lands weren’t given to us by the Mexicans nor by the Mexican government nor by anyone. They were given to us by our divine belief that we are from here and that is the difference that is what we are defending.”

Currently Guadalupe Flores organizes agroecological planting work in which youth women men and also elders participate.

“First we started planting up there [he points to the sacred Bakatete mountains] on about 500 hectares. It’s totally organic it’s not contaminated it’s good soil. And we’re starting here because it’s close to town so that the youth here can come as well.

Agroecological planting has also worked to involve Yaqui children. They are brought to the territorial limits the natural points that the entire Yaqui Nation recognizes as its territory they are called linderos [boundaries]. According to Guadalupe this has also served to strengthen their own identity.

“It’s useless to have a lot if we don’t know what to do with what we have. If this was given to us left to use as a sacred inheritance it is so that we can live and maintain ourselves from it” explains Guadalupe.

This land they show us with fig trees just beginning to sprout the budding magueys from which they distill Bacanora the dragon fruit with a plot to grow vegetables in the cooler season along with an irrigation line.

The land is so fertile Guadalupe says just toss a seed on it and it will grow. Now they’ve allied themselves with other Yaqui people who have been living in Arizona ever since their families were forced into exile during the Yaqui War.

For Guadalupe agroecological planting is not a temporary or six-year project but has “transgenerational” significance:

“We are thinking about those who have not yet been born. What are we going to leave to them? And they can’t defend themselves because they’re not here. But they will be just as more than one hundred years ago those before us left this for us even though they didn’t know us. They fought for it and here we are.”

Yaqui women are very important for the transmission of language and ancestral traditions. The people see them as reservoirs of knowledge – from historical to medicinal – and of strength. In an interview in 2017 before her murder anthropologist and ethnohistorian Raquel Padilla Ramos said that the loss of traditions and the Jiaki language is related to the fact that women no longer live communally but have to leave to work in the maquiladoras and this has impacted family and social life among the people.

Guadalupe shares how his grandmother a Yaqui woman taught him the language how to defend himself and even how to fire a gun as a child.

In the agroecological garden of Loma de Bácum there are figs mug wort grains yucca ragweed citavaro bacanora agave saguaros. The majority of medicinal plants have been planted by women. They obtained solar panels to create a sprinkler irrigation system. Seasonally vegetables such as cabbage lettuce beans corn and squash are planted.

“This is what the Yaqui Oath says and it applies to all the Yaquis all the Yaquis who were born here. We were born here we are from here and from that basis we govern ourselves we put it into practice because it is a sacred duty of all Yaquis to defend their territory and to do it no matter the consequences to the very end to defend their lives because this is practically our life. They take our land and they take that from us.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Sharing a cute snap of Chris on her Tiktok page the full-time mum who recently defended her large brood said: ""This is my oldest Crizman this is my husband Chris. She was born six days after my 16th birthday. My husband was 12 when she was born.""

People were stunned - with a number having to explain Chris wasn't Crizman's dad.

""There are less years between Crizman and Chris than there are between Crizman and like several of her siblings that's kind of funny"" one person said.

""I was about to freak out until I realised that's not her dad"" said another.""

""She is closer in age to her stepdad than her mam is"" said another.

Britni is expecting a baby in July. Crizman who is the oldest of the bunch first teased the announcement on the family TikTok page and later confirmed in a separate clip.

After asking their followers to guess the news many correctly predicted Britni was pregnant for the ninth time with some even saying she might have triplets again.

The soon-to-be mum-of-12 said: ""We normally tell everyone right away but this time we decided to wait.

""After our loss in September I was afraid to hope.""

But now at seven weeks along and one step closer to reaching her goal of 15 kids the excited mum said she can't wait to meet the newest member of the family.

The mum-of-11 previously said she wanted more kids particularly another baby girl despite already going through 600 nappies a week.

Earlier this year Britni said: “I hope we’ll try to have another girl still. I don’t think I would ever have more than 15 kids but then again I never thought I’d have 11 kids.""

Britni who shares details about her life online has defended her large brood in the past and said they are ""just like everyone else"" after being criticised for her super-sized family.

Despite what people think of her the full-time mum swears her life isn’t endless chaos and says she doesn't rely on benefits to support her family.

Previously speaking to CafeMom she said: ""People assume a lot of things about us that just aren’t true - we are just like everyone else.""

She also explained how life as a mum-of-11 can be tricky - not only because motherhood is hard but because people are quick to assume ""the kind of people who would want to have a lot of children.""

Setting the record straight she revealed: ""We aren’t on food stamps but we don’t look down on those who need them. We aren’t ignorant and we aren’t Catholic or Mormon but I do believe in Jesus.”

The US-based mum from Arkansas City Kansas had her first child Crizman 16 six days after her sixteenth birthday with her ex-husband.

They ended up having another four children together - Jordan 14 Caleb 13 Jace 12 and Cadence ten - but broke up in 2010.

After the divorce Britni said she went through a carefree phase partying at weekends and unexpectedly fell pregnant with her sixth child Jesalyn now eight in 2012.

She spent three years raising six kids alone as a single parent before meeting her current husband Chris a sub-contractor in 2014.

The pair have since had another five kids together and are now expecting their sixth.

Orlando Bloom leaves fans in hysterics over photoshopped snap of fiancée Katy Perry

Orlando Bloom has paid tribute to his beautiful fiancée Katy Perry on Mother’s Day.

The Pirates of The Caribbean actor 44 took to Instagram to gush over songstress 36 who welcomed the couple’s daughter Daisy Dove in August last year.

The proud dad left fans in hysterics with his unusual post as he photoshopped a recent image of his wife-to-be dressed as a glamourous mermaid into the snap.

Orlando could be seen holding Katy like a fish as he described her as the perfect ‘catch’.

Alongside the good-humoured snap the smitten star penned: “Got myself a real catch.

“Sending love and respect to all the amazing people who have shaped our lives supported us and loved us unconditionally.

“Happy Mother’s Day” he concluded.

Orlando ensured to make use of Katy’s recent behind-the-scenes snap of herself dressed as a stunning mermaid for an extravagant Resorts World advert.

Fans were left highly amused by Orlando’s Photoshop efforts and they flocked to the comments to share some love.

“You two are literal couple goals. This is genius” gushed one admirer.

“Daisy Dove is lucky to have two hilarious parents like you. This made me chuckle” another echoed.

Meanwhile a third quipped: “Who knew Orlando looked so good as a fisherman. Katy’s a lucky lady.”

The hilarious post comes after Orlando candidly admitted that he and Katy have neglected their sex life since the arrival of their daughter last summer.

The pair who got engaged on Valentine’s Day in 2019 have put their needs on the back burner while they have been getting to grips with parenthood.

The global economy is rapidly shifting fuel sources from carbon-emitting fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives like renewable energy. However it will take decades and trillions of dollars to make the switch. Because of that the economy will continue needing a variety of fuel sources to bridge the gap in the interim.

That's why investors shouldn't completely disregard more traditional energy options. With that in mind we asked some of our energy contributors what energy companies they believe could be long-term winners during the energy transition. They see the brightest futures for The Southern Company (SO 0.88%) Kinder Morgan (KMI 0.21%) and Enbridge (ENB 1.09%).

The other clean energy

Reuben Gregg Brewer (The Southern Company): The world looks at renewables like solar and wind as the de facto winner in the low carbon energy space. But the world has had clean alternatives for a long time including hydro power and nuclear power. Although generally safe a small number of high-profile accidents have left nuclear power on the outs. However it provides reliable base load power that can help support the growth of intermittent solar and wind. Many believe it will be a vital part of the clean energy future.

One supporter is U.S. utility giant The Southern Company which is building two nuclear power plants right now (the only nuclear plants being built in the country today). The Vogtle project as it is known has been a long slog including the bankruptcy of Westinghouse and the impact of the the coronavirus. That said once these two plants are finally up and running which should be sometime in the next two years The Southern Company will have reactors that it can rely on for decades to come as it phases out dirtier carbon-based options. And all the power that the Vogtle nuclear power plants generate will come with zero carbon emissions.

The Southern Company's dividend yield is a fairly generous 4% today (backed by two decades worth of annual dividend hikes) which is well more than twice what the S&P 500 index is offering up. It's also a step above the roughly 3.15% the average utility provides using the Vanguard Utilities Index ETF (VPU 0.89%) as a proxy. It's worth a look for dividend investors trying to find a clean energy play that's not wildly overpriced.

Vital infrastructure for the energy transition and beyond

Matt DiLallo (Kinder Morgan): While the world is rapidly pivoting toward renewable energy it will still need fossil fuels for quite a while. The cleanest option during this energy transition is natural gas. That's why the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects demand for gas to rise 29% by 2040.

This outlook bodes well for Kinder Morgan a leader in transporting natural gas in North America. Utilization of the company's existing gas network should remain high enabling it to continue generating steady cash flow. Further as demand rises it will provide Kinder Morgan with opportunities to expand its pipeline network in the future.

Meanwhile Kinder Morgan's existing assets could play a key role in transporting and storing the fuels of the future. For example the company can transport renewable natural gas and a 5% to 10% gas-hydrogen blend on its existing pipelines with little to no modifications. Moreover it could eventually repurpose much of its gas pipeline network to move hydrogen. That could yield major expansion opportunities since that fuel is one-third as energy dense as natural gas implying it would need three times the infrastructure capacity.

That's why the IEA believes that ""existing gas infrastructure is a valuable asset with significant storage capacity that can be repurposed over time to deliver large volumes of biomethane or with modifications low-carbon hydrogen."" Given this potential essential future role for Kinder Morgan's existing energy infrastructure network it could be a long-term winner as the economy transitions fuel sources.

Built to last

Neha Chamaria (Enbridge): The adoption of renewable energy may have picked up the pace but fossil fuels still accounted for 84% of the global energy consumption in 2019. In fact there are barely any alternatives yet for nearly 80% of oil's end-user demand such as in industrials air marine and heavy-duty vehicles. Clearly it'll take a really long time for clean energy sources to displace fossil fuels if at all and some energy companies could still thrive. Enbridge for example should continue to transport crude oil and natural gas through its extensive pipeline network for decades to come. As one of North America's largest energy infrastructure companies Enbridge has solid clout in the midstream oil and gas space.

In fact Enbridge has silently undergone a sea change in the past decade reducing dependency on liquid pipelines and expanding its natural gas transmission storage and distribution infrastructure. Although a fossil fuel natural gas is a relatively cleaner traditional source of energy.

Enbridge has its plans well in place. Through 2023 it aims to focus on its existing pipeline of projects which includes modernization of gas transmission. Beyond 2023 Enbridge foresees an organic growth development pipeline worth $30 billion of which more than $10 billion could be spent on gas transmission alone and nearly $6 billion on gas distribution and storage. Roughly $7 billion could go toward renewables and only the remaining to liquid pipelines. Enbridge believes its focus on natural gas and some spending on renewables should help the company achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

More importantly Enbridge is confident its growth-spending plan could boost its distributable cash flow per share by 5% to 7% in the long run which should also mean bigger dividends for shareholders from this energy company that could win even as the world shifts to renewable energy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW1sb2NhbG5ld3MuY29tL2FwLXRvcC1uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDUvMDgvdmFucy1jby1mb3VuZGVyLXBhdWwtdmFuLWRvcmVuLWRpZXMtYXQtOTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vans co-founder Paul Van Doren dies at 90,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Paul Van Doren co-founder of the Vans company whose iconic Southern California sneakers were beloved by skateboarders and became an international success has died. He was 90.

The company based southeast of Los Angeles in Costa Mesa announced Van Doren’s death on social media Friday but didn’t provide any details.

“Paul was not just an entrepreneur; he was an innovator” the company said. “Paul’s bold experiments in product design distribution and marketing along with his knack for numbers and efficiency turned a family shoe business into a globally recognized brand.”

Van Doren was a high school dropout who moved to Southern California from the Boston area. Van Doren his brother James (who died in 2011) and business partners Gordon Lee and Serge Delia opened the Van Doren Rubber Co. in Orange County in 1966 making and selling their own shoes. At first they struggled to produce enough of the product to fill the shoeboxes on store shelves.

Van Doren had two decades of experience in shoe manufacturing but none in retail he recalled.

“The first person gave me a $5 bill; a pair of shoes was $2.49"" he told Los Angeles Magazine last month after releasing his memoir “Authentic.”

“But I didn’t have any money in the cash register so I gave her the shoes” Van Doren said. “We ended up selling 16 or 18 pair of shoes that day. You know what? I said ‘Come back later to pay.' Every one of those people came back and paid.""

Van Doren's son Steve Van Doren said his father's acumen helped make the business a success.

“My dad was a systems guy” Steve Van Doren told the Los Angeles Times in 2009. “He did things like color-coding the boxes blue for men green for women and orange for boys so you could see what inventory you had right away. He would only open stores that had a free right-hand exterior wall because he thought that was the best place to catch someone’s eye if they were driving by.”

Van Doren also allowed people to order customized shoes. He expanded the customer base by allowing various designs to be sold everywhere from surf shops to department stores.

In “Authentic” Van Doren said the key to success was to give customers what they wanted.

“If it’s a checkerboard if it’s bright pinks and yellows or if it happens to be dinosaurs or a skull and crossbones listen to their two cents’ worth about colors and designs” he said.

The shoes with their canvas tops and tough diamond-patterned rubber soles caught the fancy of skateboarders. The company which kept a sharp eye on trends was quick to catch on.

“Everybody else was kicking these kids out of the park kicking them out of pools. And here’s a company listening to them backing them and making shoes for them"" Van Doren told Los Angeles Magazine.

The company paid professional skateboard Stacy Peralta to wear its shoes. Vans also sold shoes individually which benefited skateboarders who tended to wear out one at a time.

The brand's popularity soared after Sean Penn wore his own pair of Checkerboard Slip-Ons in the 1982 movie “Fast Times at Ridgemont High.""

However knockoffs and competition ate into Vans' profits along with misguided efforts to expand the range of its offerings with specialized shoes for football basketball skydiving and even breakdancing. The company was forced into bankruptcy protection in 1984 and was sold to a banking firm in 1988.

Over the years the brand's popularity waxed and waned losing ground to newer high-techier kicks and regaining it when retro came back into fashion.

The firm renamed Vans Inc. went public in 1991 and in 2004 was sold to VF Corp. of Denver which owns a large number of footwear and apparel brands including Dickies JanSport Timberland and The North Face.

Today Vans produces its shoes overseas. It continues to sell its traditional designs while also keeping an eye on trendsetters by collaborating with designers skateboarding BMX and surfing pros and other celebrities.

Vans racks up around $2 billion a year in sales and its shoes have been seen on the feet of Justin Bieber Kanye West and the Kardashians.

The company also has built skateparks and sponsored various events including the Warped Tour an annual international traveling rock festival and the US Open of Surfing in Huntington Beach Calif.

Van Doren who co-founded the footwear brand Vans out of a small retail operation in Anaheim more than five decades ago died on Thursday May 6. He was 90.

Van Doren wasn’t just an entrepreneur but an innovator. He and his partners including brother James who died in 2011 at age 72 had the unconventional idea to dabble in the retail world after starting the Van Doren Rubber Company in 1966 customizing shoes for customers and creating a loyal following.

“The Van Doren Rubber Company was the culmination of a lifetime of experimentation and hard work in the shoe industry. Like Paul from the first day of business Vans was uniquely innovative” company officials said in a statement. “Paul’s bold experiments in product design distribution and marketing along with his knack for numbers and a genius for efficiency turned Paul’s family shoe business into an all-American success story.”

Born in 1930 Van Doren was a high school dropout who at 16-year-old started as a “service boy” at a Boston-based rubber factory according to “Authentic: A Memoir by the Founder of Vans” released last month.

On a trip to Southern California in the ’60s the brothers decided to start their own brand teaming up with friends Gordon Lee and Serge Delia for the new venture.

To be successful they would have to go into retail to sell products directly to consumers so on March 16 1966 they opened a shop next to their manufacturing operations at 704 E. Broadway in Anaheim.

A sign outside read “House of Vans” a moniker still used and printed on the backs of shoes today.

The styles on the racks were organized in color-coded boxes with men’s shoes selling for $4.49 women’s for $2.29.

The first day they opened their doors they forgot to put money in the register. As customers showed up Paul Van Doren told them to pick out their style then to come back with the cash when they picked up the shoes later that afternoon.

“My dad has a lot of faith in people” Paul Van Doren’s son Steve told The Orange County Register previously for a past story.

Steve Van Doren when the brand turned 50 in 2011 detailed the early days when his father and the partners first went into business.

Steve Van Doren who still works for Vans as the company’s “Ambassador of Fun” was put to work by his father at an early age. By 10 years old he was working at the shop first organizing shoes and painting walls and a few years later as a salesman greeting customers as they entered.

The retail model boomed with lines forming outside the doors. So more locations throughout Orange County were opened including the first stand-alone retail shop in Costa Mesa off Newport Boulevard a shop still there today.

They would also go to swap meets on weekends to sell the shoes.

But more than half of the 10 stores they opened weren’t turning a profit. When their accountants advised shutting down Van Doren did the opposite and opened more stores.

The more shoes he made the cost to make them would go down he figured his son said.

For the first decade the company simply tried to stay afloat.

Van Doren coming from the East Coast was enthralled with the Southern California lifestyle. He showed up in the early days for a surf contest at the Huntington Beach Pier to mingle with surfers.

When surfing legend Duke Kahanamoku had the idea to turn his blue Hawaiian aloha print shirt into shoes Van Doren was happy to make him a pair – the first of countless custom-made shoes the brand is known for today.

In the 1970s skaters started rolling into the retail shops seeking out the brand’s tough rubber-sole shoes.

Vans were made with a thick grippy waffle-pattern rubber bottom and tough canvas that could withstand the skaters’ kickflips and tricks that would quickly wear down other shoes. And when a skater’s front-foot shoe wore down from rubbing on the grip tape of the skateboard Vans would sell them just one shoe as a replacement.

Vans adopted a phrase from skaters: “Did you see that guy get off the wall?”

It started stamping “off the wall” on the heels of each shoe. Soon it started sponsoring team riders including some of the sport’s early icons such as Stacy Peralta and Tony Alva.

Kids started drawing checkerboard designs on their rubber soles and the company took note and created its own checkerboard slip-on.

Glenn Brumage director of business development for the International Association of Skateboard Companies said Van Doren and the other founders of the brand were accidental heroes who started out just wanting to build a different less expensive shoe.

“They became – or they just were – part of the fabric of skateboarding and surfing” he said. “They became so important to us in surf and skate through their constant support. I don’t think they were trying to market their way into the category. They were organically the category.”

Vans was hitting its stride when a young actor Sean Penn told producers he needed to wear the shoes in their “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” movie. The movie’s soundtrack would feature Vans shoes on its album cover propelling the brand into the mainstream.

Vans went from a $20 million to a $45 million business in the ’70s but the growth happened too fast too soon. It was creating all kinds of shoes – basketball break dancing and beyond – and found its shoes sitting in boxes as it tried to reach outside of its core consumer.

In 1984 Vans filed for bankruptcy.

Paul Van Doren had to tell his employees he couldn’t give them a raise for three years. He told everyone to bring pencils from home because he couldn’t afford to buy pens his son Steve recalled.

The banks wanted him to liquidate but a judge agreed to let Paul Van Doren bring in a plan every six weeks and make payments.

Every penny owed on the $12 million debt was paid.

Van Doren and the other partners retired when venture investment firm McCown De Leeuw & Co. offered to buy the company in 1988 for $74 million with the new company taking the brand public in 1991.

In 2004 the company was sold for $396 million to VF Corp. which assured Vans executives the brand would continue to operate on its own.

These days it’s a multi-billion dollar company with global operations successful for staying loyal to its core customers – the skaters and surfers who grew with the brand.

The name Vans is on multiple skate parks and it sponsors some of the globe’s biggest surf contests. It also has a strong presence in art and music culture building a following through the Vans Warped Tour.

Alva in Van Doren’s memoir called the Vans co-founder an inspiration.

“He’s proof of the American dream. A mentor and fearless leader and last but not least the father we all love and respect” Alva wrote.

Pro skater Christian Hosoi of Costa Mesa said Van Doren’s legacy isn’t about just a shoe company.

“It’s a shoe company that’s about the people. It was about the customer it was about the riders. It was about taking the information from the pro skateboarders and applying it to the business” he said. “It was always about his integrity to do things the right way not to take the short cut not to do unethical things.

“You can be the best businessman but to have character is truly something that is rare in an industry like ours” he said.

Van Doren had retired in Kentucky but in the past decade moved back to California to be closer to his family Hosoi said. In that time Van Doren got to tour stores around the world experiencing first hand the impact the brand had across the globe Hosoi said.

“We know how it affected California but to go around the world and see how Vans has been that effective from a business model – to share the stories around the world in every country. It’s remarkable” he said.

Hosoi still a Vans team rider today at age 53 and Van Doren shared many conversations during those travels talking about skating’s roots going back nearly six decades and how the brand -– and Van Doren – became a pivotal part of the sport’s past.

“There’s not many people who will listen to the athletes and how they feel with their heart beats” Hosoi said. “It’s something that is one in a billion – that’s why it’s such a sad day.”

Tributes from Vans fans were starting to appear as news of his death spread.

A website stuckunderthepalms.com dedicated solely to Vans loyalists thanked Van Doren for the “awesome brand that has given us identity and a true sense of community.”

“Always reminding us to be authentic and do things our own way while remembering to make it about the people. We will never lose sight of that” a tribute on the website reads. “Vans has created more opportunity for us than anything else and we ultimately have Paul Van Doren to thank for that.”

Duke Edukas owner of Surfside Sports in Costa Mesa remembers taking his first trip to Anaheim to get his first pair of Vans when he was a teen back in the late ’60s.

He said he remembers after the brand blew up following the “Fast Times” movie appearance thinking the success would last five years tops.

But there’s no sign of the Vans brand created in a small shop in Anaheim by businessmen with a vision slowing its stride as its legacy lives on he said.

“It’s a remarkable success story.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkd2Vlay5jb20vbWVkaWEvd2h5LW1vcmUtbWVkaWEtY29tcGFuaWVzLWFyZS1sb29raW5nLWZvci1jLXN1aXRlcnMtd2hvLXVuZGVyc3RhbmQtYml0Y29pbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Media Companies Are Looking for C-Suiters Who Know Bitcoin,"In late March 98-year-old Time magazine posted a job opening for a new chief financial officer with one notable qualification: “comfort with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.” In four weeks more than 600 people had applied on the digital currency job board Crypto Jobs.

Only this time the three-year-old question was wearing his mask. Flight attendants simply feared the boy would not be able to keep it on.

Southwest Kicks Off Family Over FEAR Disabled Three-Year-Old Would Remove Mask

Here’s what gets me about this incident: the kid was wearing the mask. He also had a disability which Southwest Airlines used as a pretext to throw the family off.

Three-year-old Orion Scott has sensory processing disorder. His parents reached out to Southwest prior to their flight. They mentioned he *might* have trouble keeping his mask on but provided the requisite information including a note from the doctor and their occupational therapist.

The family boarded their flight to Florida and settled into their seats. Orion had his mask on and according to the family and had kept it on throughout the process.

All of a sudden a flight attendant appeared. Addressing Caroline Orion’s mother she said:

“You have to get off the plane. The captain doesn’t feel comfortable with your family on it.”

The flight attendant then explained they were not being kicked off for violating any rules but out of fear the three-year-old might violate rules.

Caroline added:

“It’s not OK. There was no empathy. There was no understanding. We were just humiliated. It was traumatizing and humiliating. “We thought we were doing the right thing and for being forefront and honest we were punished for it.”

The family paid $1700 to fly home on United the next day did not mention the disability and encountered no issue. Orion kept his mask on.

Asked about the incident a Southwest spokesperson noted:

Southwest Airlines regrets any inconvenience this family experienced while traveling and our Customer Relations Team is contacting the family directly regarding their experience. Southwest Employees are working each day to ensure the requirements of the federal mask mandate with sensitivity during these challenging times. We appreciate the ongoing understanding and cooperation among our Customers and Employees as we work collectively to support the comfort and wellbeing of all who travel with us during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Here’s my commentary: you’re a gutless wonder Captain. A coward lacking empathy is a danger in the cockpit. You have NO BUSINESS FLYING FOR SOUTHWEST.

CONCLUSION

The Orions tried to do the right thing and were punished for it. As Caroline noted:

“We’re never going to disclose again and that’s a shame because it should be ‘How can we support people who need extra support?’ Not ‘Let’s kick them off the plane.’ No family should have to go through this!”

She’s 100% correct and unless the family is holding back information I unconditionally condemn Southwest Airlines here. Southwest has a problem handling passengers with disabilities and I am getting sick and tired of the new stories that are constantly popping up. Southwest owes this family more than an apology…

Andrew Levy disagrees though. The former cofounder and president of Allegiant Air and former CFO of United Airlines just premiered his latest venture low-cost carrier Avelo Airlines. ""Honestly there could not be a better time for us to launch"" said Levy. ""People are ready to reconnect with family and friends and explore new places.""

With the operation of its first flight from Hollywood Burbank Airport in Los Angeles to Charles M. Schulz Sonoma County in Santa Rosa at the end of April Avelo Airlines became the first new mainline carrier in the U.S. in 15 years. And we went along for the ride.

Seasonal Routes Smaller Cities

Aimed squarely at price-sensitive fliers ""Avelo was built from scratch to offer leisure travelers a smooth way to get where they want to go through smaller more convenient airports in major markets"" said Levy.

""We've devoted a lot of time to creating an experience that reduces the frustration and increases the joy of travel"" added Levy. Flying in and out of minor airports means necessities like parking check in and security remain accessible and uncrowded. Levy also pointed out that due to the pandemic-related drop in air traffic Avelo was able to get unheard of deals on its planes and vie for slots at airports that it would not have otherwise been able to stake out.

In addition to its maiden route Avelo will add services from Burbank to various other outdoorsy destinations throughout the western U.S. in the coming months including:

Arcata-Eureka CA (ACV)

Bend-Redmond OR (RDM)

Bozeman MT (BZN)

Eugene OR (EUG)

Grand Junction CO (GJT)

Medford OR (MFR)

Pasco WA (PSC)

Phoenix-Mesa AZ (AZA)

Ogden UT (OGD)

Redding CA (RDD)

Santa Rosa CA (STS)

Flights to most of these destinations will be operated only three or four times per week but that's the whole idea. By using secondary airports in larger markets — Ogden instead of Salt Lake City for instance Mesa instead of Phoenix and Burbank instead of Los Angeles (LAX) — Avelo hopes to attract customers looking for straightforward point-to-point flights to get them to vacation spots like national parks ski areas and wine regions.

The airline has also announced its intentions to set up its first East Coast hub at Tweed New Haven Airport (HVN) in Connecticut with 100 employees based there. Although the airline has not yet shared which routes it will operate from the location it is investing $1.2 million to help modernize and upgrade the airport.

It's true that during the pandemic legacy airlines like Delta and United have pivoted to limited-time point-to-point routes between major hubs in the Northeast and both coastal destinations and mountain areas in the West too. But Levy thinks they will revert to traditional hub-and-spoke networks and focus on high-paying business travelers post-COVID.

""Avelo's connection-free service on currently unserved routes is one of the reasons we're able to offer everyday surprisingly low fares"" he said. By cutting out connections targeting routes where demand might be strong but seasonal and avoiding the congestion that larger hubs suffer from Avelo aims to keep its costs low and pass on the savings to customers.

Low Fares High Fees

In fact the airline is selling tickets starting as low as $19 each way now through Sept. 15. Just beware of incidental fees. Pre-reserved aisle or window seat selections will start at $5 apiece. Your first checked bag will set you back $10 while overhead carry-ons will price out at $35 each. Priority boarding will be $10 while the charge to bring along a pet will be $95.

Given the uncertainty that still surrounds travel and the fact that Avelo will be trying to woo customers away from other airlines in the near term there will not be change fees on tickets. Plus it won't charge extra for making reservations through its call center rather than online.

First Flight Festivities

As for Avelo's first public flight it was all clear skies. Flight XP 101 was scheduled to depart Burbank at 10:45 a.m. Pacific time but there was fanfare at the airport beforehand. Media attendees and #avgeeks who had purchased tickets were greeted by Avelo employees at the carrier's new ticket counters and issued boarding passes.

From there it was a quick walk down the hall to the TSA checkpoint — none of the serpentine lines here that you might find in a larger airport. A small crowd started gathering at gate B4 which was manned by four newly minted Avelo agents and festooned with balloons in the airline's signature colors of purple gold and teal.

Levy thanked everyone for coming and cut a ceremonial ribbon. Then it was time to board via a ramp out on the tarmac — albeit slowly since everyone was eager to take photos with the two Avelo Airlines jets parked there. Levy stood at the bottom of the jet bridge personally handing each passenger a decorative ticket jacket while the flight's pilot doled out commemorative bag tags.

So far Avelo Airlines has just three Boeing 737-800 aircrafts and expects to be flying six by the end of 2021. Though these are not new planes their interiors have been completely redone. Each 737 has 189 slimline seats in a single cabin with rows laid out in a 3-3 configuration similar to what you'd find on Southwest Airlines.

The 129 standard economy seats have a mere 29 inches of pitch and are around 17 inches wide. There are 60 premium seats at the front with 31 to 38 inches of pitch for which you can expect to pay upcharges starting at $18. Most seats recline (not those in exit rows) and have tray tables and small shelves to hold electronics. Don't expect power ports or entertainment screens though.

The airline will eventually offer in-flight Wi-Fi but it was not yet functional. It also intends to obtain a liquor license so that it can sell alcoholic beverages but passengers toasted with sparkling apple cider on the inaugural flight.

Chipper flight attendants gamely doled out individually wrapped packages containing small bottles of water Purell disinfectant wipes and packets of cookies. Although these were free it's likely that the airline will eventually charge for such amenities in keeping with its pricing model.

Watching from the front of the cabin an exuberant Levy detailed the airline's Soul of Service ethos saying ""We try to make sure that every crew member we bring aboard is genuinely kind and caring and enjoys serving others. And we give them the power to take care of our customers."" He hopes that will become a point of distinction for the airline over time ""as more and more customers engage with them whether on the airplane at the airport or through the contact center."" He added ""We're trying to build a very purposeful culture.""

Just over an hour into the flight after we had hugged the coast and banked over San Francisco the captain came on the intercom to announce that we were beginning our descent. Around 15 minutes later we landed in Santa Rosa. In his concluding remarks on the ground Levy said ""This was our first flight — the first of many. Each and every one matter but we just couldn't wait to get to this part of our journey where we are taking care of customers.""

In a year when most news about airlines (and travel in general) has been rather dismal the advent of Avelo Airlines is a rare bright spot that should have fliers celebrating. Although Avelo's fleet and route network will remain limited for some time to come folks in the western U.S. will enjoy bargain tickets to popular leisure destinations. Plus if Avelo's operations succeed more established carriers might weigh new routes of their own. For instance West Coast incumbent Alaska Airlines recently ramped up flights to Santa Rosa from Burbank Orange County and San Diego. All that might mean even more choices for travelers and hopefully even lower fares for the foreseeable future.

Facebook employees reportedly wrote that ""Starbucks is in the process of evaluating their organic presence on FB and whether they should continue to have a presence on the platform at all.""

The comments went on to say that Starbucks experienced overwhelmingly ""negative/insensitive hate speech-related comments"" on such posts according to a report from BuzzFeed.

Should Starbucks remove its page from the social media platform it would be one of the largest companies to do so but not the first.

Elon Musk removed the SpaceX and Tesla Facebook pages in 2018 after he was challenged to do so on Twitter as part of the #DeleteFacebook campaign. While the companies remained on Instagram which is owned by Facebook the pages were never reactivated on the platform.

STARBUCKS SEES CUSTOMERS RETURN PROFITS RISE

Discussion over Starbucks’ decision to remove its page from Facebook comes just months after more than 500 brands including Starbucks temporarily pulled their advertising from the social media platform as part of a Stop Hate for Profit boycott campaign.

Starbucks spokesperson Sanja Gould would not confirm to BuzzFeed whether the company was planning to delete its Facebook page saying ""While some changes have been implemented we believe more can be done to create welcoming and inclusive online communities.""

Facebook spokesperson Dani Lever also told BuzzFeed that Facebook ""[works] with our clients around the world on various issues and as this post shows we are working with them to keep hate off of their pages.""

Special to the Palm Beach Post

KISSIMMEE — The St. Andrew’s Scots scored four unanswered points in the fourth quarter to secure the program’s fifth boys lacrosse state championship 13-5 over St. Edward’s on Saturday at the Austin-Tindall Sports Complex in Kissimmee.

St. Edward’s sophomore attacker Ford Norris scored twice to open the second half cutting the deficit to just three at 7-4 but St. Andrew’s took full control of the FHSAA Class 1A boys state championship less than two minutes later.

“We just dug down deep and played well” St. Andrew’s head coach Tony Seaman said after the win. “It’s a 48-minute game and we’ve been really good in the second half all year long.”

With the win the Scots finish the 2021 season undefeated (16-0) while St. Edward’s fall to 16-5 on the year. For St. Andrew’s it’s the program’s first boys lacrosse state title since 2012.

“It’s awesome” Seaman said. “It means a lot to these kids and they’ll never forget it. It means a lot to me too. This is one of my favorites.”

The Scots started off strong jumping out to a 4-0 lead with eight minutes left in the second quarter. Off a blocked shot junior Quin McGowan scooped and scored putting St. Andrew’s on the board first. Then goals from Jojo Pores Zach Brent and Kurt Schwarz gave the Scots a four-shot lead.

But Pirates junior Riker Pratt scored two goals before the half bringing St. Edward’s within two at halftime.

St. Andrew’s responded well to open the third quarter extending its lead to four again as Jack Shulte took full advantage of a Pirates’ turnover. He scored his first at the 10:49 mark of the third. Schulte would steal and score again before the quarter was over giving St. Andrew’s a 7-2 lead entering the fourth.

Trailing by five St. Edward’s did what it could as Norris scored two goals in a matter of minutes. Leading by only three now the Scots ran off four goals in less than two minutes. Junior Nick Golubov won two draws which turned into quick goals including one of his own with 8:24 remaining.

While St. Edward’s was able to stop the bleeding with Norris scoring his third goal of the second half it would be too little too late. St. Andrew’s senior Will Adams shot and scored from the outside giving the Scots a seven-goal lead up 12-5 with 3:18 left.

Senior midfielder Anthony Borodiak tacked on one more giving St. Andrew’s 13 for the game.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdG9kYXkuc3RjbG91ZHN0YXRlLmVkdS8yMDIxLzA1LzA4L3Njc3UtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy1ncmFkdWF0ZXMtd2l0aC0xMC1jZXJlbW9uaWVzLW1heS03LTgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SCSU celebrates graduates with 10 ceremonies May 7-8 – St. Cloud State TODAY,"St. Cloud State University’s official Spring 2021 Commencement took place on campus on May 7-8.

The Tyan Thunder CX GC68A-B7126 is a dual-socket 1U platform. This is also a cost-optimized platform designed to pack more cores into 1U.

Tyan Thunder CX GC68A-B7126

The front of the Tyan GC68A-B7126 has twelve 2.5″ drive bays. Tyan has a newer chassis that can take advantage of more drives by moving functionality to the rack ears (e.g. the power button and USB port) and by using thinner drive trays. This increases density by 20% over ten 2.5″ bay models from previous generations.

Inside we have two Intel Xeon processors or to be more precise 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Ice Lake processors. With this generation we get 8-channel memory per CPU and up to DDR4-3200 support. Here Tyan is utilizing 8 DIMMs per CPU which is one DIMM per channel.

With Intel’s 10nm Ice Lake we get PCIe Gen4 which is exposed via two risers on the rear of the chassis. There is an OCP NIC 2.0 slot as well. This is designed for lower-cost networking than OCP NIC 3.0 slots that are becoming more common.

On the rear we also get redundant power supplies two 1GbE ports an IPMI port two USB 3.0 ports and VGA/ serial. These are accompanied by redundant power supplies.

Final Words

It has been a while since we looked at a Tyan server with an Intel Xeon Scalable solution. As you can tell from the cover photo this will be the next server we review from Tyan. We just did not manage to get it into our Ice Lake launch piece. If you want to learn more about the new Xeon platform you can read our launch piece: Intel Xeon Ice Lake Edition Marks the Start and End of an Era. More to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(SHAK) Beyond Meat Inc. (BYND) and more.

Trending Economic News

PPP is running out of money but the Restaurant Revitalization Fund has begun accepting applications. The additional $292 billion of Paycheck Protection Program funding will run out before the May 31 deadline. Thus far SBA has approved 10.8 million PPP loan applications. SBA’s Restaurant Revitalization Fund started on May 3.

New homes cost $36000 more because of an epic shortage of lumber. Last year sawmills shut down production amid expectations for construction delays. Now they can hardly keep up with pend-up demand. Lumber futures soared above $1525 per 1000 board ft. from $500 last November.

Brazil’s central bank (BCB) raised its benchmark interest rate to fight inflation. Higher energy prices have pushed inflation above the bank’s target ceiling. BCB increased the rate by 0.75% and expects to raise it again next month. YTD BCB lifted interest rate from 2% in Jan to 4.25% by Jun. Consumer prices rose 6.17% in the year through mid-April and many economists forecast 8% by May.

Hiring accelerated in April but still fell short of expectations. ADP reported private payrolls grew by 742K in April below forecast of 800K. It was the fastest pace of labor market recovery since September amid an increase in COVID-19 vaccinations and the lifting of business restrictions. The service-providing sector added 636K jobs led by leisure & hospitality (237K).

India’s second COVID wave may have a bigger impact on the global supply chain than many realize. India’s pharmaceutical industry is the third largest in the world and produces 70% of the world’s vaccines (note: not COVID vaccines). India also provides IT back-office and other non-core operations for companies around the globe. Most indicators suggest the economic impact of COVID is less severe than last spring but recovery will be delayed to 2022.

In honor of Mother’s Day existing or new T-Mobile subscribers can get up to $830 off an iPhone 12 mini or iPhone 12 with an eligible trade in. The best part of this deal is that eligible transactions won’t require you to add another line.

To qualify for a free iPhone 12 on T-Mobile you need to have a “qualifying line of service on an eligible plan” which might not include some older legacy plans. You need to purchase a new iPhone 12 12 Pro 12 Pro Max or 12 mini on a monthly plan and pay sales tax. Then you need to trade-in an eligible device to earn the full promotional amount.

Eligible phones include all iPhones after the iPhone 8 any Pixel 4 device LG V50 or V60 OnePlus 7 Pro 5G 7T 7T Pro 5G Mclaren 8 5G 8 Pro Moto RAZR or Asus ROG Phone II. Partial credit will be offered for many other smartphones check the promotion details on T-Mobile’s website for the full list.

The “free” part comes in the form of 24 monthly statement credits. Once the trade-in is processed T-Mobile will write off every installment payment for 24 months. This makes it so you’re required to pay for the remainder of the phone if you decide to leave the service.

It’s not often that T-Mobile offers iPhones in promotions like this one and this one will only last through the weekend. As a reminder T-Mobile is still offering its Galaxy S21 On Us promotion with an eligible trade-in.

Unfortunately that hasn't exactly proven to be true although the high-end handset was treated to a fairly significant update Unfortunately that hasn't exactly proven to be true although the high-end handset was treated to a fairly significant update enabling support for Magenta's standalone 5G network technology back in the fall of 2020 as well as various other minor performance and security improvements over time.





Commercially released running Android 10 out the box the T-Mo-specific OnePlus 7T Pro 5G model is finally making the jump to Google's latest (stable) OS version as we speak. Confirmed by the ""Un-carrier"" itself  this long-awaited (and long overdue) rollout has been kicked off just yesterday (May 7) also containing Big G's April (rather than May) 2021 security patches.





While the second-largest US wireless service provider has no changelog of its own to share with its customers we can probably rely on the ""international"" list of new features UI tweaks and performance enhancements published back in March to give us an idea of what to expect.





Although some things could be different and if history is any indication a number of add-ons are likely to be missing from the update scheduled to make its way to T-Mobile users any moment now you can definitely count on this goodie pack being quite hefty and vastly improving many key aspects of your user experience.





Naturally the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G is not among the best T-Mobile phones money can buy in 2021... because the handset is no longer officially available in the US. But if you already own this bad boy you will undoubtedly be delighted (or at least relieved) to see it follow in the footsteps of the slightly older OnePlus 7 Pro and humbler OnePlus 7T at long last.





While the decidedly eye-catching and unconventional OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren Edition was obviously never meant to appeal to the masses the T-Mobile subscribers that spent a whopping $900 on the Snapdragon 855+ powerhouse less than a year and a half ago probably expected the phone's software support to be worthy of that extravagant price tag.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvZWNvbm9teS9ob3ctbXVjaC1pbmNvbWUtdGF4LWRpZC13YXNoaW5ndG9uLXN0YXRlcy1iaWdnZXN0LWNvbXBhbmllcy1wYXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How much income tax did Washington state's biggest companies pay?

The Silver Knights played their first game at the home of their parent club and came away with a 5-3 victory over the San Jose Barracuda before an announced crowd of 3830. (@BenSGotz/Twitter)

Nearly half of the Silver Knights’ current roster already skated at T-Mobile Arena whether it was an NHL regular-season game or in the preseason.

In the case of Jack Dugan and Layton Ahac their experience came during a college touranament.

That didn’t make Saturday any less special.

The Knights played their first game at the home of their parent club and came away with a 5-3 victory over the San Jose Barracuda before an announced crowd of 3830.

“We’ve had that circled on our calendar for a long time” coach Manny Viveiros said. “You could even tell this week during practice there was an extra jump in our step too. Obviously this is where all these kids want to be and eventually play full time here. It was good for them to have that experience.”

Pavel Dorofeyev scored twice including a power-play goal to put the Knights on top 4-2 in the third period. Jack Dugan added an empty-net goal to seal his team’s second straight victory.

Cody Glass finished with a goal and two assists to help keep the Knights in first place in the Pacific Division by points percentage with four games remaining.

The teams meet again Tuesday at Orleans Arena before the Knights host second-place Bakersfield in a three-game series to close out the regular season.

“I think that might be a bit of a war” forward Ben Jones said.

The Knights are fighting for the top seed and home-ice advantage throughout the postseason tournament to decide the champion of the Pacific Division.

The American Hockey League announced Friday that fourth- through seventh-place finishers will participate in a single-elimination tournament May 18 and 19 with the winner advancing to the best-of-three semifinals.

“We’re trying to get as high as we can and get more team points” Dorofeyev said through a translator. “In this situation the more games we can play the more experience we’re going to have. It’s going to be really interesting especially for us first time in the American Hockey League to feel that atmosphere to play in playoffs.”

Pucks on net

The Silver Knights ranked 21st out of 28 teams in shots on goal per game (27.29) entering Saturday but adjusted their philosophy in an effort to test goalies more often.

Starting with the 44-shot effort in an overtime win at San Diego on April 25 the Knights averaged 37.3 shots on goal in the past four games while going 2-2.

“When we shoot pucks we seem to retrieve them pretty quickly” Jones said. “I think we just decided that we were going to try to get more pucks to the net and play a meat-and-potatoes style of game rather than try and make the pretty backdoor pass that sometimes doesn’t end up working out well.”

One of the most popular changes is to ditch your old mobile carrier in favor of something new. If you’re over Verizon and its steep prices fear not. There are plenty of other carriers to consider and it’s pretty easy to make the change. Here’s everything you need to know on how to cancel Verizon’s service.

We’ll run through all of the primary services — wireless coverage Verizon’s Fios Internet and even Fios TV. The broad strokes are generally the same so we should have you liberated from Big Red in no time. Ready to make the switch?

How to cancel Verizon wireless service

Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority

Wireless service is Verizon’s bread and butter; it’s the largest US provider after all. That also means that you’re most likely here to find a way out of Big Red’s network. The process itself isn’t complicated but you’ll have to be ready to spend some time on the phone. Verizon will do just about anything it can to convince you to stay — service agents will offer special discounts fancy perks and more. However all you have to do is follow these simple steps: Call Verizon customer service at 1-844-837-2262.

Make sure to have all of your account information handy.

Inform the agent that you plan to cancel (or port) your service. That’s it. There are just three simple steps to follow but that doesn’t mean Verizon’s agents will make the phone call easy. It may help to have a solid excuse ready when they try to convince you to stick around.

If you’re not ready to leave Verizon entirely and you want to ditch a single line the process is far more manageable. Log into your My Verizon account and open your menu of devices. Find the line you want to remove and scroll through the options until you find the remove selection.

On the other hand you can always port your number away to a different carrier. This usually means that you’ll have to provide some information to your new carrier and let Verizon know your plans. You can also tap into My Verizon if you want to port your service though service agents may try to make it difficult again. If you plan to port your service make sure not to cancel your service outright as you may lose your number. Here are a few other carriers to consider:

How to cancel Fios Internet and TV service

Verizon Wireless corporate store

For better or worse Verizon links its Fios internet and TV services. On the bright side it means that you can follow a similar setup for both services. However it also means that Verizon will likely try to sell you on keeping both services instead of canceling either one. Once again be ready to stand your ground and don’t take no for an answer. Here’s what you need to know: Give Verizon Fios a call at 844-837-2262 typically within standard business hours.

Gather your account information and be ready to provide it to the agent.

Inform the service agent that you wish to cancel your service and proceed through the necessary steps. To make matters worse Fios will probably hit you with an Early Termination Fee (ETF). Fios typically locks you into two years of service which means that the ETF starts at an eye-watering $350. It will drop by $15 per month as long as you stick around so it may benefit you to wait a month or two until the fee is more manageable.

After you square things away on the phone you will most likely have to return your equipment to a local Verizon store. You typically have 30 days to take care of this so gather your cable boxes routers or modems sooner rather than later. See also: Best internet providers in the US

Because of the ever-increasing legal pressure from Take-Two Interactive a team of modders has been forced to shut down a GTA project they had been working for almost 6 years now. The project was named GTA Underground. This upcoming mod was built especially for GTA San Andreas and attempted to mix up all the previous GTA maps into one big massive project.

Looks like fans won’t be able to experience this massive open-world adventure. The project is also rumored to bring some non-GTA cities featured in games like Bully and Manhunt. Unfortunately now this won’t happen. The developers of the mod have now officially removed it from their website.

Over recent months Take-Two has been placing legal pressure and copyright infringement case against these modders teams and companies. Dkluin (lead developer of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas mod) wrote “Due to the increasing hostility towards the modding community and imminent danger to our mental and financial well-being. We sadly announce that we are officially ceasing the development of GTA Underground and will be shortly taking all official uploads online.” Dklukin also expressed his gratitude for the supports.

He thanked the community for supporting the team for so long. He also highlighted the point that he had an exceptional experience working on this project along with talented team members. The mod has already faced some serious issues with Take-Two Interactive way back in July 2021. Because of this it was removed completely from ModDB. Now after much struggle the mod has been completely removed from all the websites and sources.

GTA: Underground is not just a simple copy-paste project as it includes major AI and traffic routines added to each map. This change makes the project fully playable as GTA cities. However the team was also planning to add their own custom creation cities to the game.

Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar have shared no official news on this shutdown. Certainly Rockstar is working o the much-awaited remastered version of all the three highly popular GTA versions. However nothing is confirmed yet. Multiple rumors suggest that the company is trying hard to release this masterpiece later this year.

This demonstrated a significant and fatal error in security and election integrity.”

Russell J. Ramsland Jr. sold everything from Tex-Mex food to light-therapy technology. Then he sold the story that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.

ADDISON Tex. — Key elements of the baseless claim that the 2020 election was stolen from President Donald Trump took shape in an airplane hangar here two years earlier promoted by a Republican businessman who has sold everything from Tex-Mex food in London to a wellness technology that beams light into the human bloodstream.

At meetings beginning late in 2018 as Republicans were smarting from midterm losses in Texas and across the country Russell J. Ramsland Jr. and his associates delivered alarming presentations on electronic voting to a procession of conservative lawmakers activists and donors.

Briefings in the hangar had a clandestine air. Guests were asked to leave their cellphones outside before assembling in a windowless room. A member of Ramsland’s team purporting to be a “white-hat hacker” identified himself only by a code name.

Ramsland a failed congressional candidate with a Harvard MBA pitched a claim that seemed rooted in evidence: Voting-machine audit logs — lines of codes and time stamps that document the machines’ activities — contained indications of vote manipulation. In the retrofitted hangar that served as his company’s offices at the edge of a municipal airstrip outside Dallas Ramsland attempted to persuade failed Republican candidates to challenge their election results and force the release of additional data that might prove manipulation.

“We had to find the right candidate” said Laura Pressley a former Ramsland ally whose own claim that audit logs showed fraud had been rejected in court two years earlier. “We had to find one who knew they won.”

Ramsland Huffines He made the pitch to Don Huffines a state senator in Texas. Huffines declined. Sessions He tried to persuade U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.). Sessions declined.

No candidate agreed to bring a challenge and the idea of widespread vote manipulation remained on the political fringe — until 2020 when Ramsland’s assertions were seized upon by influential allies of Trump. The president himself accelerated the spread of those claims into the GOP mainstream as he latched onto an array of baseless ideas to explain his loss in November.

The enduring myth that the 2020 election was rigged was not one claim by one person. It was many claims stacked one atop the other repeated by a phalanx of Trump allies. This is the previously unreported origin story of a core set of those claims ideas that were advanced not by renowned experts or by insiders who had knowledge of flawed voting systems but by Ramsland and fellow conservative activists as they pushed a fledgling company Allied Security Operations Group into a quixotic attempt to find evidence of widespread fraud where none existed.

To assemble a picture of the company’s role The Washington Post obtained emails and company documents and interviewed 12 people with direct knowledge of ASOG’s efforts as well as former federal officials and aides from the Trump White House. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private matters or out of fear of retribution. Three individuals who were present in the hangar for those 2018 meetings spoke about the gatherings publicly for the first time.

By late 2019 ASOG’s examination had moved beyond audit logs. Among other claims Ramsland was repeating the ominous idea that election software used in the United States originated in Venezuela and saying nefarious actors could surreptitiously manipulate votes on a massive scale. As the 2020 election approached he privately briefed GOP lawmakers in Washington and met with officials from the Department of Homeland Security documents and interviews show.

ASOG’s examination by last summer had already cost more than $1 million according to a document the company gave government officials that was obtained by The Post. Ramsland had sought funding from Republican donors whose fortunes were made in the oil gas and fracking industries Pressley said.

This comes from ASOG's confidential “executive summary” of a report on how to “eliminate system-wide election fraud threat” that was given to government officials in summer 2020. (Obtained by The Washington Post)

After the Nov. 3 election to an extent not widely recognized Ramsland and others associated with ASOG played key roles in spreading the claims of fraud The Post found. They were circulated by Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) a staunch Trump ally who had been briefed by ASOG. And Ramsland’s assertions were incorporated in the “kraken” lawsuits filed by conservative lawyer Sidney Powell — who The Post learned had also been briefed two years earlier by ASOG — and aired publicly by Rudolph W. Giuliani then Trump’s personal attorney as they tried to overturn Joe Biden’s victories in key states.

During that period Trump was hyper-focused on making the case that the election had been rigged former White House aides said. He would listen to “literally anyone” who had a theory about it in the words of one former senior administration official.

Ramsland Among those voices were the people in Ramsland’s network. Gohmert Powell Giuliani In the aftermath of the election Trump was surrounded by those repeating claims Ramsland had made ... Trump ... and in seeking to overturn the election Trump himself embraced some of those ideas.

The idea that the election was stolen took root and remains persuasive to millions of Americans. Although Trump’s own Department of Homeland Security called the election the “most secure in American history” polls have consistently shown that about one-third of Americans — including a majority of Republicans — believe that Trump lost because of fraud. An internal poll by the National Republican Senatorial Committee in March found that among Republicans who believed the election was stolen nearly half said hacked machines were partly to blame and an additional 8 percent said they were the main source of fraud.

The fraud claims have undermined faith in the electoral process been cited as a motivation for legislation to curtail access to polls in dozens of states and spurred the companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic to file billion-dollar lawsuits. Ultimately the conspiracy-mongering helped inspire the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.

In an email exchange with The Post Ramsland 68 confirmed that ASOG provided research for Powell and Giuliani but said that he had never spoken to Trump himself and that the company was “one of many voices” that expressed concerns about election-system vulnerabilities. He noted that election security has been a long-standing concern across the political spectrum and said that many others had “reached similar conclusions regarding irregularities in the election system.”

Through an attorney Powell confirmed that she had met Pressley but did not respond to questions about where or about her work with Ramsland. Giuliani and his attorney did not respond to messages seeking comment. Gohmert declined to comment on his interactions with Ramsland.

Through a spokesman Trump declined an interview request.

Pressley 58 said she and Ramsland had a falling out in part over his use of her analysis of election data and her suspicions that his motives were financial or partisan. She said she believes he has not provided evidence for his claims about the 2020 election and fears those claims could undercut legitimate questions about the integrity of U.S. voting. “I’m heartbroken by it” Pressley said recently speaking in detail about ASOG for the first time during a three-hour interview near Austin.

In emails to The Post Ramsland called Pressley “unreliable” and said ASOG ceased doing business with her “because of her lack of technical experience and complete inability to understand electronic investigative work.” He said Pressley had a limited view of the work performed by ASOG adding that “our cyber team had already gone far beyond the simple audit log data and analysis she had initially brought to ASOG.”

Many people and organizations claimed after the election to have evidence casting doubt on Biden’s victory. But Ramsland and ASOG’s role was unique said Matt Masterson a former senior U.S. cybersecurity official who led a team tracking the integrity of the 2020 election for DHS.

Repeatedly and at key moments Masterson said ASOG was the source of morsels of inaccurate information that shaped public perception. Some of the ideas it pushed had circulated previously he said but they were supercharged by the influence and connections of Ramsland and the people around him — and by the air of authority the company provided.

“It wasn’t just that the president would tweet about their stuff. It was all these little nuggets and grist that they provided or that were cited to them in testimony or in the ‘kraken’ cases. It provided the appearance of substance and fact to something that had no substance or fact” said Masterson who has not previously discussed ASOG publicly. “It was like: ‘Look these are professionals. … They have former military experience. And look at what they found.’ They gave those who wanted to push and believe in the lie something to hold on to.”

Convinced there was fraud

The nation’s embrace of electronic voting grew out of the debacle of 2000 when hanging chads and other hard-to-interpret paper ballots muddled the outcome of the presidential race souring many Americans on the analog technology the country had used for decades.

Two years later Congress passed the Help America Vote Act dedicating billions of dollars to modernize U.S. elections. It encouraged jurisdictions across the country to replace their old voting machines with new digital systems.

The result was a massive investment in paperless touch-screen voting machines also known as direct-recording electronic voting machines or DREs which states came to view as simpler cheaper and more accessible to people with disabilities.

“There were some electronic voting machines before that but this was the thing that opened the floodgates to them” said Matt Blaze a professor of law and computer science at Georgetown University who researches election technology and security.

Blaze and other experts warned that DREs introduced new security risks: Without a reliable paper trail there was no way to check whether the machines had accurately recorded voters’ intentions.

As concern about this vulnerability mounted a growing number of states and localities began requiring voting machines to leave a paper trail. Today most voters mark paper ballots by hand and they are then scanned and tabulated by a machine. Some use touch-screen machines that produce a printed copy of the voter’s selections. A few still vote on paperless machines.

There has never been a documented case of a U.S. election being stolen through hacking according to Blaze and other experts.

Still concerns about the security of electronic voting continue to simmer including among experts. It does not help they say that some machines contain modems to simplify the reporting of results and that those machines have sometimes been left connected to the Internet for extended periods.

It was DREs and the built-in inability to verify their results that helped persuade Pressley that her race for a seat on Austin’s nonpartisan city council in 2014 had been stolen.

As a candidate Pressley told voters she had grown up outside Dallas the daughter of a cattle auctioneer. She said she arrived in Austin two decades earlier as a poor single mother and succeeded against the odds. She earned a doctorate in chemistry from the University of Texas at Austin worked for 17 years in the semiconductor industry and owned a company that sold bottled rainwater.

The campaign foundered amid revelations she had previously appeared on Infowars the right-wing website operated by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and on another occasion had said she believed data showed that military-grade explosives were planted inside the twin towers on 9/11. That comment prompted the Austin American-Statesman to retract its endorsement of her. (Pressley told The Post she had “no opinion” on whether planes brought down the World Trade Center.)

The race was not close: Her opponent a community organizer defeated her by a margin of almost 30 points.

Pressley could not believe it.

“I knew in my heart that I had won” she recently told a gathering of law enforcement officers outside Houston one of hundreds of speeches she has given about the case “and I became convinced there was fraud.”

A recount confirmed her loss. But nearly all the ballots had been cast on DREs and Pressley remained skeptical.

She took the case to court.

Among other evidence Pressley cited an audit log that contained nine instances when a machine made by the company Hart InterCivic recorded an event as “Invalid/Corrupt.” She argued that those and other alleged irregularities meant the true outcome of the election was impossible to determine.

A state judge threw out the case before trial and fined her and her attorney for bringing a frivolous lawsuit. Pressley appealed and in 2016 a three-judge panel upheld the lower-court ruling.

“Pressley produced no evidence that the ‘Invalid/Corrupt’ error messages resulted in any legal votes not being counted resulted in any illegal votes being counted or otherwise materially affected the outcome of the election” the Texas Court of Appeals panel found adding that Pressley’s own expert witness testified it was “not known” what the nine error messages meant.

“This type of expert testimony is based on uncertainty and mere speculation and is therefore unreliable and irrelevant” the panel said.

Pressley would go on to appeal to the Texas Supreme Court which said it was too late to take up her underlying fraud allegations but found that they were not frivolous and dropped the fines. Her expert witness had testified that corrupted memory sticks that contain ballot data “could” damage the credibility of vote counting the court wrote. To avoid fines it wrote “Pressley needs only to have some factual basis for her claim … not evidence that is ultimately admissible.”

Hart InterCivic told The Post that the error messages did not impact the tally and that “the election results were accurately recorded and reported.” The company said the error messages indicate a failed connection between memory sticks and the devices that read them — a hiccup resolved by simply reconnecting and trying again.

By 2018 Pressley had become an outspoken critic of electronic voting systems that lack a paper trail. She founded True Texas Elections and recruited poll-watchers in more than a dozen counties to look for evidence of fraud in the state’s March primary that year. Afterward she filed a complaint with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) alleging that Democratic votes might have been undercounted.

On election night in November 2018 the volunteer poll-watchers obtained audit logs generated by the central tabulation machines in Dallas County as they tallied votes some of which had been cast on DREs manufactured by the largest voting-machine company in the nation Election Systems and Software or ES&S. Such logs record an array of activity and can be difficult to interpret for anyone unfamiliar with the software involved.

In a statement ES&S said that its voting equipment has been through thousands of hours of independent testing and that its accuracy has been verified through audits and other examinations.

But as Pressley pored over the logs she fixated on specific words. “Downloaded” “cleared” “replaced” the audit logs said over and over.

Soon she came to suspect that those audit logs too were a window into surreptitious vote-switching.

‘When someone says “I know a guy” …’

Allied Special Operations Group as the firm was first named was initially envisioned as a one-stop shop for government and corporate clients seeking cybersecurity physical protection and sophisticated open-source intelligence services Ramsland and former employees told The Post.

The company was formed in June 2017 by Adam T. Kraft a former senior official at the Defense Intelligence Agency. Kraft was the company’s chief executive and it was based out of his house in a subdivision north of Fort Worth. Kraft declined to comment for this report.

An early promotional video described ASOG as “a group of highly trained professionals who have seen it all” and it stressed the intelligence backgrounds of some team members. “When someone says ‘I know a guy’ he’s talking about ASOG” said the narrator who said that ASOG personnel had taken part in the types of missions “that many of us only see in the movies.”

Months after Kraft filed papers to establish the company he was joined by a trio of other men state records show.

Alvan “Locke” Neely a retired Secret Service agent who first served in the Ford administration became ASOG’s chief operations officer.

J. Keet Lewis was named ASOG’s vice president of strategy. Lewis served on the executive committee of the Council for National Policy (CNP) a Washington-based organization that for decades has been a networking hub for powerful conservative activists and donors.

According to his biography in Securities and Exchange Commission filings Lewis consulted on international energy projects and had helped develop the Skimmer Basket Buddy a patented maintenance tool for swimming pools. He did not respond to messages seeking comment.

Ramsland who was also then a member of the CNP joined as ASOG’s chief financial officer. The son and grandson of West Texas oilmen lived with his wife in the Preston Hollow section of Dallas home to former president George W. Bush and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban.

Ramsland had charted an unusual career path including investment banking consulting on a proposed cattle ranch in the South Pacific and working with NASA on a venture aimed at growing crystals in space. He also owned oil and gas interests in Texas Oklahoma and New Mexico records show.

According to business filings in Florida Lewis and Ramsland later served together on the board of Photonx a company that according to its website uses variable wavelengths of light “to treat specific pathogenic and chronic diseases.” (Ramsland told The Post that in its current form Photonx’s device “expressly doesn’t purport to treat disease.”)

Photonx now has office space inside the Addison hangar according to a mailbox outside and a sign visible to visitors at the front door.

Ramsland was a “numbers and models” man said Gene Street who partnered with him in the 1990s on the London restaurant that Ramsland’s résumé obtained by The Post says was “Europe’s highest-grossing Tex-Mex restaurant.”

“If you ever needed to know where a single penny went he was the guy that could tell you” Street said.

Ramsland had donated to the campaigns of numerous Republicans including Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) campaign finance filings show. He had also run for office himself challenging Rep. Pete Sessions in the 2016 Republican primary as a part of the tea party the fiscally conservative movement that had formed in opposition to President Barack Obama’s agenda. A campaign ad showed Ramsland wearing a cowboy hat and shooting a rifle at cardboard boxes labeled “open borders” and “Obamacare.” Ramsland lost by nearly 38 points.

Weeks before he joined ASOG Ramsland spoke to a conservative association delivering remarks rife with outlandish claims according to video reviewed by The Post. Ramsland called the deadly 2012 attack on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi Libya a “deep-state operation” and he traced the origin of the “deep state” to a World War II-era collaboration involving Prescott Bush the father of former president George H.W. Bush; the Muslim Brotherhood; and liberal financier George Soros — who was born in 1930 and was not yet an adult.

ASOG’s early work included hunting for intelligence about a group of Chinese nationals for an exiled Chinese billionaire an associate of former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon and providing VIP protection details in the United States and abroad a specialty Neely brought from the Secret Service.

In the fall of 2018 influential Texas Republican fundraiser JoAnn Fleming urged Ramsland and Pressley to join forces Pressley told The Post. Ramsland soon shifted ASOG’s attention to election security. Fleming did not respond to messages seeking comment.

Neely said he left his position with the company when resources moved toward election security.

“My focus was and has always been protection and investigations” he said in a brief interview outside his home in suburban Dallas. “They were going a totally different direction and it was just not — they were pouring all their resources into that and it was just not my gig.”

The relationship between Ramsland and Kraft also grew strained according to three people who worked for or with the company at the time. Kraft eventually departed under pressure the people said.

‘It had to get to Trump’

In November 2018 Texas Republicans were reeling from a battering at the polls. Democratic Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke had lost only narrowly to Cruz and strong Democratic turnout had cost Sessions his longtime seat representing a swath of Dallas and its fast-growing suburbs as the party picked up seats in both chambers of the state legislature. Some Republicans were looking for explanations beyond the apparent purpling of Dallas.

Soon Pressley was in the hangar briefing Ramsland on her election-fraud theories. “Russ got really excited. They all did” Pressley said. “I think they saw this as their next big thing.”

ASOG and Pressley began looking for a losing candidate who would challenge the election outcome and force Dallas County and ES&S to lift the hood on their technology to show whether votes had been manipulated according to Pressley and to emails and other documents provided by her attorney.

They alighted on state Sen. Don Huffines (R) a wealthy real estate developer whose bid for a second term in the Texas legislature had just ended in defeat handing his district to a Democrat for the first time in almost four decades.

Within weeks of the election Pressley said Huffines was in the hangar with James E. “Trey” Trainor III who had been nominated by Trump to serve on the Federal Election Commission but was not yet Senate-confirmed. Trainor was advising Huffines at the time.

An email from Pressley to Ramsland. (Obtained by The Washington Post)

Pressley presented her analysis of the audit logs and their mysterious “replaced” and “cleared” messages she said. Ramsland told Huffines he was “horrified” by signs of fraud she said. Challenging the result and forcing officials to turn over voting-machine data could prove the vote was manipulated they argued.

Pressley said she and Ramsland waited impatiently for Huffines to decide. In early December he told them he would not challenge his loss.

“We were all ready to go. We had someone who was going to fund the challenge and everything” she said. “It was devastating.”

Huffines did not respond to requests seeking comment.

In an interview Trainor confirmed the hangar meeting with Ramsland and said he advised Huffines not to bring a challenge. Under Texas law contested state Senate races are decided by a Senate vote rather than by a judge.

“We were never going to convince senators that something nefarious had gone on whether it did or didn’t” Trainor said noting that some Republicans might not have backed a challenge that risked embarrassing the GOP secretary of state.

ASOG briefed a number of people during this period including Powell and Gohmert according to Pressley and a former ASOG employee named Joshua Merritt. Pressley said Powell approached her after one briefing in the hangar gave her a business card and called the audit-log analysis proof of fraud.

Ramsland and Lewis were also working to coax another losing candidate to bring a challenge: Sessions the ousted congressman.

Lewis called a Sessions donor and left a voice message suggesting that the congressman’s race had been stolen. The donor forwarded the message to Carolyn Malenick a volunteer for Sessions. Within days Sessions was on a plane from Washington to Texas for a trip to the hangar according to Malenick who joined him there.

A calendar invitation for the Dec. 14 2018 meeting shows that Ramsland Lewis and Pressley were among those expected as was Fleming the conservative fundraiser who Pressley said had connected her and Ramsland.

Also in attendance Malenick said was conservative talk-show host Kevin Freeman.

Pressley said she gave a PowerPoint presentation that began with a picture of Joseph Stalin and a quote attributed to the Russian dictator: “I consider it completely unimportant who in the party will vote or how; but what is extraordinarily important is this — who will count the votes and how.”

Ramsland followed accompanied by the purported white-hat hacker who would not provide his name to the audience Malenick said. The two presented a $4 million plan that included ASOG standing up an “operations” center to search for voting irregularities Malenick and Pressley said.

Malenick a longtime Republican fundraiser told The Post she eventually came to believe Ramsland was misleading donors.

Ramsland told The Post the center was Kraft’s idea and that election investigations are costly. He said Malenick had “problems with truthfulness” citing an FEC case from the 1990s that ended with her paying a $5000 fine.

With a certification deadline fast approaching Sessions too decided against formally challenging his election result according to his brother and attorney Lewis Sessions.

Privately Pete Sessions did not drop the matter. He filed a confidential complaint with Paxton the Texas attorney general alleging “a variety of legally questionable conduct” in Dallas County voting. The complaint provided to The Post by Lewis Sessions included an affidavit from Pressley in which she claimed her poll-watchers reported they had been treated with hostility and had seen an elections worker using an Internet-connected laptop. She also enumerated audit-log messages — including “replaced” and “time stamp mismatch” — she considered suspicious.

On Jan. 31 2019 Pressley presented her findings to Paxton in a meeting in an Austin office used by Ramsland she said. Emails between her and Ramsland show preparations for the meeting.

But again nothing came of the effort.

Ramsland has said in media appearances that ASOG brought information to Paxton’s office and urged further examination. It is unclear whether he was referring to the Pete Sessions complaint and Pressley’s briefing or to a separate complaint and Ramsland did not respond to messages seeking clarification. He told The Post that he now believes Paxton’s office lacks the financial resources and the “level of technical expertise and sophistication” necessary for a meaningful investigation.

In a statement Paxton’s office said: “We take every credible allegation of fraud seriously. In this case after a thorough investigation by our office with the assistance of election systems experts cybersecurity experts and the FBI we found the claims in this case were unverifiable and an audit of the voting records confirmed the outcome of the election.”

Legally the allegations of fraud in Dallas in 2018 had all but reached a dead end Pressley said.

With Pressley in tow Ramsland launched a fundraising blitz traveling to the ranches and mansions of some of Texas’s wealthiest conservative funders. Ramsland told potential funders that their money would support legal challenges to ensure election integrity ahead of the 2020 election Pressley said. “The hook was always Trump — that their guy could lose” Pressley said.

Pressley said that early in February 2019 she accompanied Ramsland to present her audit-log analysis in Midland to Charles Richard “Dick” Saulsbury who had made a fortune in engineering work in oil and gas. In Cisco they met with Farris and Jo Ann Wilks whose wealth stemmed from the sale of a family fracking business.

An email from Ramsland to Pressley on Jan. 30 2019. (Obtained by The Washington Post)

Pressley said pledges as high as $700000 were discussed. The Post obtained correspondence in which Ramsland named Saulsbury as a potential funder and in which Pressley referred to a “Wilks investor meeting.”

Saulsbury did not respond to questions through a spokeswoman. Reached briefly by phone Farris Wilks said he had no memory of providing money to Ramsland and then hung up.

Ramsland said neither the Wilkses nor the Saulsburys were donors. Malenick and a former ASOG employee said the company had sought to raise capital at the time by selling ownership shares. Ramsland did not respond to a follow-up question about whether the Wilkses or the Saulsburys were investors.

Pressley a Republican who has donated to candidates from both major parties said she began to grow suspicious that Ramsland’s motives were political or financial or both particularly in February 2019 when he took her research to D.C. to meet with Washington insiders but excluded her.

“I don’t think he wanted me there and hearing what he was saying” Pressley said. “Everything he was doing … became about getting to Trump. He had this idea it had to get to Trump.”

Pressley’s company True Texas Elections sought a consulting contract from ASOG in February 2019 but it never materialized. As their relationship deteriorated Pressley sent a cease-and-desist letter to ASOG late that month demanding that Ramsland stop presenting her research without authorization according to their correspondence.

Ramsland denied to Pressley that he had tried to exclude her from the meetings in Washington and challenged her allegation that he had co-opted her audit-log analysis. She had shown her presentation to dozens of people without any confidentiality agreement or copyright markings he wrote. “We frankly do not understand how a project to save Texas and our country has turned into this” he wrote in a letter reviewed by The Post. “This isn’t just your project. This has been a team effort from the beginning.”

Ramsland spreads the word

As 2019 progressed Ramsland decided to take his case to the public via “Economic War Room” the online television show hosted by Freeman.

Like Ramsland and J. Keet Lewis Freeman was a member of the Council for National Policy according to membership directories posted online by the watchdog group Documented.

“We finally decided that if we couldn’t get the government to pay attention without public opinion and public pressure the best guy to go to would be Kevin” Ramsland later recalled in a panel discussion a recording of which is posted online.

Asked whether CNP had supported Ramsland’s efforts the group’s executive director former congressman Bob McEwen (R-Ohio) said: “CNP is a convening organization of several organizations and individual members. And that’s what it does. It doesn’t sponsor legislation or oppose legislation. It is an opportunity for people patriotic citizens to gather together to share their concerns and interests in our nation’s security.”

In emails exchanged over the course of a week Freeman said he was unavailable to answer questions about his presence at the meeting and his involvement with Ramsland.

Ramsland appeared on the show multiple times in 2019 and 2020 at least once with another ASOG employee who appeared with his face in shadow and voice disguised. The employee’s identity was kept secret on the show with Freeman referring to him as Jekyll a “white-hat hacker.” It was the same purported hacker who had accompanied Ramsland during meetings in the hangar with Sessions and others according to Pressley and Malenick.

The Post has reported that Jekyll is Merritt a former Army mechanic who studied network security administration after leaving the military. In December The Post reported that affidavits in Powell’s lawsuits from a purported “military intelligence expert” using the pseudonym “Spider” were actually written by Merritt.

Merritt who told The Post in December that he had briefed Powell and Gohmert declined to comment for this report.

Together Ramsland and Merritt painted a picture of an entirely porous voting system wide open and hackable. Ramsland made a range of specific claims including that hackers or rogue operators could direct vote data to a remote location change it and then “re-inject” it or they could unleash “some sort of a bot” to change the results without anyone noticing. He said there were indications that vote manipulation was already happening and said all major U.S. voting-machine companies were vulnerable.

Among his claims was that source code initially written by the company Smartmatic formed the basis of much of the election software used in the United States. Ramsland often pointed out as other critics had that Smartmatic’s founders were Venezuelan.

Representatives of ES&S Dominion and Hart InterCivic the nation’s three largest voting-machine companies told The Post they do not use or license Smartmatic software. They all said their companies’ software code is not in any way based on Smartmatic code and Smartmatic said its code is not incorporated in other companies’ software.

Ramsland told The Post that “many cyber groups” have reported that different companies share software code similarities. He did not respond to questions asking that he name any cyber groups that support his claims about Smartmatic code.

In his media appearances Ramsland also resurfaced an old baseless claim about Scytl a Spain-based election technology firm that he described as a “somewhat disturbing company” in one appearance on Freeman’s show. “They’re housing all of our votes and they’re doing it in an insecure fashion” he said in a September appearance.

The following month Ramsland added a twist claiming on an online talk show hosted by conservative Debbie Georgatos that American votes were “being held on a server in Frankfurt Germany.”

Scytl has said that it has no servers in Frankfurt and that its systems are not used to count or “house” votes in U.S. elections. Ramsland told The Post in an email that “any 8th grader with a reasonable background in white hat cyber investigation tools” could trace votes to a Scytl server in Frankfurt.

One of Scytl’s products is a platform used by some counties to publicly display unofficial vote tallies online on election night according to the company. After polls close as results begin trickling in they are published online by media outlets and state and local governments. Those unofficial election-night reports depend on tallies that are transmitted by local officials to a publishing system. In some counties that publishing system is made by Scytl.

Ramsland claimed to The Post that Dallas County’s use of such a Scytl platform showed votes were sent overseas.

But Harri Hursti a data-security expert who has spent years highlighting vulnerabilities in electronic voting technology said that Ramsland’s claims about vote-fixing overseas were nonsensical. Even if a hacker could manipulate the numbers that are posted online the underlying votes would not be affected Hursti said. Those are kept separately sequestered from the Internet and they are — once tallied and checked for discrepancies — the official results of any election.

ASOG paid Hursti’s company Nordic Innovation Labs $2500 in November for an 18-page memo explaining the history of Dominion its business acquisitions and the many systems and machines Dominion now supports according to Nordic’s managing partner Dan Webber.

Hursti said he believes ASOG ignored information he provided in an effort to shape a sensational narrative about election fraud. Such baseless claims are now distracting time and attention from actual election-security problems he said.

“This is counterproductive” he said. “There is so much that needs to be fixed.”

Over this same period in 2019 and 2020 Ramsland was attempting to win the attention of Washington insiders an effort Gohmert was also engaged in.

Gohmert has said that a year before the election he gave Trump information from a group of “former intelligence people that were monitoring the election in Dallas County” — a description that closely resembles the way ASOG portrays itself — and that the president considered it “a real problem.” Speaking on a podcast in November Gohmert said his own reaction to the information was “Holy cow.”

In July 2020 ASOG gave a two-hour briefing to seven members of the House Freedom Caucus Ramsland told MyPillow founder Mike Lindell for his movie about alleged election fraud. Ramsland said members were “horrified” at what ASOG presented.

ASOG also reached out that summer to the Senate Homeland Security Committee and was referred to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency part of DHS. CISA reviewed a packet of information from ASOG that included the document saying the cost of the company’s investigation had surpassed $1 million. Also included was an affidavit from Pressley and over 40 pages dedicated to her and her poll-watchers’ observations of the vote in Dallas County in 2018. The Post obtained the documents.

An excerpt from ASOG's May 2020 “introduction briefing outline” which the company gave to government officials. (Obtained by The Washington Post)

Ramsland said that DHS officials in Texas found ASOG’s information compelling but that CISA officials in Washington were “too busy to take a briefing” and agreed to only a short call.

In a statement DHS confirmed that its officials had spoken with Ramsland and his associates “reviewed the information provided and determined that it was speculative and not actionable.”

A full-court press

Hours after the final votes were cast on Nov. 3 Trump doubled down on the claims he had been making for months. “This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country” Trump said. “We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly we did win this election.”

Over the next several weeks Ramsland and others tied to ASOG played key roles in the full-court press to persuade Americans that the 2020 election had been rigged.

Ramsland and Lewis appeared on Lou Dobbs’s show on Fox Business Network claiming there was evidence of widespread fraud. The claim that all U.S. voting machines secretly harbored Venezuelan software was repeated by Giuliani and Powell in numerous media appearances. The claim that Scytl servers in Frankfurt could be used to flip votes went viral on the right after it was repeated by Gohmert.

On Nov. 12 Gohmert said he had told Trump that data on these servers was critical to getting to the bottom of the fraud.

“I had suggested that the president might get information from Scytl” Gohmert said on Newsmax “and I sent him specifics that he needed to get that would show a lot of fraud.”

The next day Gohmert told a virtual prayer group that the Scytl data would show “how many votes were switched from Republican to Democrat” claiming that he had learned all this from “some of our former intel people.”

Scytl strongly denied the allegations. In a statement the company said its products were not used to tally votes in U.S. elections and that it “does not even have offices in Frankfurt and does not have servers or computers in the German city.”

But Trump fanned the theory according to archives of his deleted tweets. Late on Nov. 15 he retweeted to his millions of online followers a video clip of Ramsland saying in a pre-election interview that votes from 29 states were routed through “a server in Frankfurt Germany” and that Scytl “controls and reports your vote.”

Ramsland also contributed material to Powell’s lawsuits and to one brought by L. Lin Wood Jr. another pro-Trump lawyer seeking to overturn Biden’s victory. On Nov. 18 a nine-page affidavit from Ramsland filed to a federal court in Wood’s Georgia case made an explosive allegation: Multiple precincts in Michigan had recorded more votes for president than what he said was the estimated number of voters.

Ramsland’s claim was amplified the following day by Giuliani and Powell at a news conference at the headquarters of the Republican National Committee. Like Ramsland Powell said that excess votes in some jurisdictions were as high as 350 percent.

The claim in Ramsland’s affidavit soon collapsed under scrutiny. The precincts he cited were actually in Minnesota a mistake Ramsland blamed on “my guys” in his exchanges with The Post. Ramsland said the Minnesota numbers also showed excess votes a claim contradicted by official results.

In an interview Wood said he did not know Ramsland and referred The Post to the lawyer who represented him in the case Ray S. Smith III. Smith noted that a corrected affidavit had been filed to the court and declined to comment further.

Another of Ramsland’s affidavits claimed a 139 percent voter turnout in Detroit — meaning the number of votes cast exceeded the number of voters. Detroit’s official election results show that about 258000 of its 506000 registered voters cast ballots — a turnout of just under 51 percent. Ramsland later filed an affidavit saying his original figures were based on data that was online but that “no longer exists [f]or some unexplained reason.”

Two Ramsland affidavits filed in Arizona purported to expose more than 100000 illegal votes in the state again based on high turnout rates and suggested forensic testing to determine whether batches of fake ballots had been cast for Biden. Ramsland attached the résumés of six “key team members” he said had been involved in the preparation of his material. The only one identified by name was a former ASOG computer scientist who had died a year earlier.

Ramsland and one of his associates also played starring roles in the election-integrity “hearings” that Giuliani and GOP state legislators held in Pennsylvania Arizona Michigan and Georgia. The events were intended to persuade legislators to wrest control of the election certification process and demand further investigation.

Phil Waldron a retired Army colonel who specialized in psychological operations and is now chief executive of a cybersecurity firm appeared as a witness at each of those hearings. He said he was working with ASOG to examine the 2020 election.

“Your vote is not as secure as your Venmo account” Waldron concluded in a hotel ballroom in Phoenix on Nov. 30 provoking murmurs from the audience.

“Pardon me? Say that one more time” Giuliani said.

Waldron obliged. A video clip of the exchange was posted to Trump’s official YouTube page.

Waldron declined to comment for this report.

By December Ramsland was opening doors for people seeking to challenge the election results. He connected Patrick Byrne the billionaire former chief executive of the online retailer Overstock with Powell and Powell connected Byrne with Giuliani Byrne told The Post.

Byrne was bankrolling a group of what he described as cyber experts — his “bad news bears” — to investigate election fraud. “They were the ones really getting their fingernails dirty so to speak hacking-and-cracking” Byrne said in an email exchange with The Post. He said Ramsland who had come to Washington for the effort “acted as the conduit and synthesizer for a lot of research that was being done by other parties and technologists in our network.”

On Dec. 18 Trump hosted a now-infamous hours-long meeting at the White House during which Byrne Powell and her client Michael Flynn Trump’s former national security adviser sought to persuade the president to appoint Powell special counsel to investigate the election including by examining voting machines in key swing-state counties.

Trump ultimately did not appoint a special counsel.

During this period some White House lawyers heard Trump make claims that made no sense or seemed “bat-shit insane” one former senior administration official said later learning they came from a network that The Post found included Byrne Powell and Ramsland.

According to a document obtained by The Post skeptical Trump advisers developed a list of pointed questions aimed at determining whether there was evidence for the claims many of which by then revolved around Dominion. The evidence never surfaced the people close to the former president said.

Byrne told The Post that White House officials “refused to look” seriously at the claims and that he and his allies will ultimately be vindicated.

ASOG gets access to machines

Of all the ways in which Ramsland pushed the stolen-election narrative arguably the most damaging was an ASOG report on Dominion machines in Michigan’s rural Antrim County said Masterson the senior cybersecurity adviser who was then focusing on elections at DHS.

Antrim County became ground zero for baseless claims about Dominion voting machines when early on Nov. 4 county officials posted unofficial results showing Biden winning by some 3000 votes — a seeming impossibility in a reliably conservative region. Election officials quickly acknowledged the mistake and called it human error saying a clerk’s failure to correctly update software had led to inaccurate vote totals. Final results showed Trump had won by more than 3000 votes.

Trump allies seized on the mistake as evidence of rigged or at least faulty voting machines. RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel claimed at a news conference that a “major software issue in Antrim County” could mean results were wrong in other counties using similar technology. Trump tweeted a Breitbart article that sought to tie Dominion software to the error that made Antrim “flip blue in favor of Joe Biden” and to Election Day “glitches” that delayed voting in two Georgia counties.

The following day on Fox News Powell said that computer glitches were “where the fraud took place where they were flipping votes in the computer system or adding votes that did not exist.” She called for an audit “of all of the computer systems that ... played any role in this fraud whatsoever.”

Powell’s wish for an examination of voting machines was granted after local real estate agent William Bailey filed a lawsuit in Antrim County on Nov. 23 alleging that the election had been marred by “material fraud or error.” Four days later an ASOG team working for Bailey showed up at the offices of three Antrim townships and requested Dominion voting-machine records.

On Dec. 4 Judge Kevin A. Elsenheimer a former Republican leader in the Michigan legislature ordered that the ASOG team be given further access to the county’s voting equipment for a forensic examination. The decision which offered a rare opportunity for election skeptics to examine Dominion machines was celebrated by Trump’s campaign.

“BIG WIN FOR HONEST ELECTIONS” Giuliani said on Twitter.

Jenna Ellis a senior legal adviser to Trump referred to the ASOG examiners as “our team” on Fox News. Ellis did not respond to requests to clarify the Trump campaign’s relationship with ASOG.

The ASOG team returned to Antrim on Dec. 6 to examine county election equipment. ASOG’s Dec. 13 report signed by Ramsland made sweeping allegations about a conspiracy to fix the election. It claimed that Dominion’s systems were “intentionally and purposefully designed” to generate ballot errors and then to shunt those ballots to electronic adjudication where administrators could change votes at will with no oversight.

The judge allowed the release of a redacted version on Dec. 14 the day members of the electoral college met to make Biden’s win official. Trump tweeted about ASOG’s report several times claiming it exposed a “massive fraud” that cost him the election and saying Elsenheimer “should get a medal” for releasing it.

ASOG’s report claimed that audit logs for Dominion machines showed an alarming 68 percent “error rate.”

That alleged error rate — which ASOG calculated by dividing the number of perceived error messages by the total numbers of lines in the audit log — was “meaningless” according to an analysis by J. Alex Halderman a University of Michigan professor of computer science and engineering. Halderman who as part of the lawsuit examined the Antrim results and the ASOG report at the request of the Michigan secretary of state and attorney general wrote that audit logs record multiple lines for each ballot scanned and that many of those lines are “benign warnings or errors” that have no bearing on the accuracy of the machines’ count.

For example he said ASOG appeared to count the warning “ballot has been reversed” as an error that showed votes had been tampered with. But that entry means that a voter attempted to feed his ballot into the machine and the machine balked and spit it out — just as a vending machine often balks at a wrinkled dollar bill. That happens all the time Halderman wrote.

Of ASOG’s claim that many ballots were sent to electronic “adjudication” where they were manipulated Halderman said his examination showed that Antrim County did not perform electronic adjudication of ballots at all. Halderman said that ASOG had correctly identified some security weaknesses in the county’s election system but there was no evidence that anyone had exploited those weaknesses.

“The report contains an extraordinary number of false inaccurate or unsubstantiated statements and conclusions” he wrote.

County and state officials as well as Dominion also said key claims in ASOG’s report were baseless.

Ramsland told The Post that ASOG had just six days to do its report and that Halderman’s analysis contradicted only 12 of ASOG’s 29 “core observations.”

Three days after the court released the report a hand recount of the county’s ballots showed that the presidential election results were correct off from the previously reported results by only 12 votes out of some 16000 cast. Dominion’s machines had counted accurately.

“The tabulators did what they were supposed to do and they did it very accurately and there’s absolutely no evidence that there was some reverse cyberattack that manipulated them” said Michigan state Sen. Ed McBroom a Republican who led a state Senate investigation of fraud claims. The ASOG report he said was “probably more harmful to the discussion” than anything else happening in Michigan at the time.

“I don’t see how anybody can take Mr. Ramsland and his group seriously as genuine purveyors of fact” he said. “It’s very clear they’re beyond mistaken and misrepresenting what actually happened either out of carelessness or with some sort of purpose.”

At his “Save America” rally in Washington on Jan. 6 Trump made reference to Antrim County and “the troubling matter of Dominion Voting Systems” as an example of how he had been wronged.

“In one Michigan county alone 6000 votes were switched from Trump to Biden” he said. He also repeated Ramsland’s claim that there were more votes than voters in Detroit. “In Detroit turnout was 139 percent of registered voters” he said. “Think of that.”

He called the Nov. 3 vote “the most corrupt election in the history maybe of the world” and then urged his supporters to march to the Capitol. By the thousands they complied.

Sun Development and Management Corporation is aiming to develop a stylish new Tapestry Collection-branded hotel in Music City.

Located on the site of the former Johnstone Supply building in Nashville this 181-key newbuild will rise 11 floors high and incorporate a retail and restaurant space on the ground level.

A brand-new development for Nashville

Concept and exterior design plans for this ambitious scheme were approved by The Metro Development and Housing Agency Design Review Committee in 2019.

At the time Nashville Post reported that the developer planned to create the property at 501 Third Avenue South in Rutledge Hill following the demolition of the former Johnstone Supply building at the south-west corner of the Third Avenue South and Peabody Street intersection. According to the article Sun Development paid US$4 million for the 0.6-acre site in 2017 and enlisted Civil Site Design Group Nashville for land development consulting planning and civil engineering.

Design-led hospitality

Ratio Architects has been brought in to come up with the new hotel’s architecture and Manuel Zeitlin Architects is overseeing the design of the building’s interiors. As a Tapestry Collection by Hilton hotel the property promises to connect guests with the locale through its unique style and vibrant personality.

This forthcoming hotel will form part of the SoBro neighbourhood.

""China's recovery from the pandemic gives hope to the world Hainan's International Consumer Products Expo is a practical step to bring such hope to other countries"" said Xiong Yu a professor at the Britain-based Surrey Business School of the University of Surrey.

HAIKOU May 9 (Xinhua) -- In recent days thousands of consumers and business persons in Haikou capital of China's southernmost Hainan province have witnessed the economic vitality at the first China International Consumer Products Expo (CICPE).

The expo running from May 7 to May 10 has attracted 648 foreign enterprises showcasing over 1300 brands in Haikou and is expected to be the largest consumer goods expo in the Asia-Pacific region.

Striving for post-pandemic recovery multinational giants came to the expo to debut their new products and showcase their top-notch goods and overseas small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) also flocked here to observe the booming Chinese market.

Fabrice Megarbane L'Oreal's president for North Asia Zone and chief executive officer (CEO) of L'Oreal China told Xinhua that with the prevention and control measures of COVID-19 pandemic entering a regular basis China continues to open up to the world with a positive and enterprising attitude setting an example for other countries.

Expressing his belief that China's business environment will be more friendly as the opening up measures will continue to deepen Megarbane said by connecting China's domestic and international markets multinational enterprises have the opportunity to obtain a wider range of resources.

U.S. luxury fashion company Tapestry thinks alike. Yann Bozec president of Tapestry Asia Pacific said at the scene ""the expo is not only an innovative platform bringing together high-quality products and services from all over the world but also an important opportunity to showcase our brand concepts expand market channels and innovate consumer trends.""

""The constant upgrading of Chinese consumer demand and rising standards has brought new trends and opportunities to the market becoming a powerful driving force for the growth of the global market"" Bozec said.

As the pandemic continues to batter world economy the first trade fair in China's biggest free trade port has not only attracted global giants but also groups of foreign SMEs.

Showing Xinhua reporters around the Irish pavilion Gareth Hargadon head of Economic Section with the Irish Embassy in China proudly introduced products ranging from food and beverage to animal nutrition luxury home wares and babycare products calling them unique offerings of Ireland.

Though Ireland is a small country its brands are active participants of physical expos in China such as last year's China International Fair for Trade in Services in Beijing and China International Import Expo in Shanghai he noted.

""I think the more these trade fairs happen the more opportunities for Irish companies to promote their products because China is a massive market ... There is a big opportunity for us here"" Hargadon said.

Lee Junhyung CEO of Sunwah-Fonwin Korea Inc said Korean companies came here with ""high expectations"" and many of them had achieved results beyond expectations on the first day of the expo.

""The (South) Korean companies need this kind of expo to enter the Chinese market and to find buyers"" he said.

Suppara Seakacharn commercial consul with Thai Consulate-General in Guangzhou told Xinhua that many Thai companies interested in joining the CICPE failed to come to China due to the pandemic so the commercial section offered those companies online channels to tap into the Chinese market.

In the opinion of Paolo Bazzoni chairman of China-Italy Chamber of Commerce (CICC) the expo is a very important message from China which is significant for Italy.

Noting that China is unlike many places of the world that forbid travels Bazzoni said the CICC ""will facilitate all the exhibitions in China in order to attract our company to follow.""

""I think China has a role to demonstrate to the world that is possible to recover it's possible to continue and grow"" he said.

He said the open free trade and offshore duty-free policy and new development paradigm of ""dual circulation"" have given Hainan unprecedented advantages pushing the province to a leading place in the world in terms of business growth.

A report jointly released recently by KPMG China and The Moodie Davitt found that the Hainan free trade port will likely become the world's biggest duty-free market in the near term if it continues on its current growth curve.

By the end of 2020 offshore duty-free business in Hainan was worth approximately 5 billion U.S. dollars boosted by an enhanced shopping policy said the report.

Promoting trade and connecting world markets not only benefit China but also bring recovery hope and inject impetus to the world economy.

""China's recovery from the pandemic gives hope to the world Hainan's International Consumer Products Expo is a practical step to bring such hope to other countries"" said Xiong Yu a professor at the Britain-based Surrey Business School of the University of Surrey.

Jack Chan chairman of services company EY China said the CICPE provides a vast stage for quality goods from across the world which will definitely promote the global supply of high-end consumer goods and services.

Besides driving forward consumption the expo can also accelerate the development of modern service industry in sectors like finance exhibition freight and logistics Chan said. Enditem

Yet loan sharks are increasingly using these groups to extort money from their victims according to England’s Illegal Money Lending Team (IMLT) an organisation that prosecutes illegal lenders and supports victims.

Such lenders are also targeting their victims online – the IMLT’s 2020 victim statistics report shows that one in 10 victims met the loan shark via social media platforms such as WhatsApp Snapchat and Facebook or through dating websites. Criminals are also creating their own WhatsApp and Facebook groups that appear to be for local communities but are actually ways to maintain control over their victims according to Tony Quigley the head of the IMLT. “It looks like a local community group” he said. “They will say ‘come and join the group’ ‘see what’s going on’. But it has a more sinister side to it.”

Loan sharks operate by offering victims short-term loans then increasing their repayments arbitrarily and adding extra costs often with threats of violence if money is not repaid.

“The illegal moneylender uses the group to apply pressure to the individual” he said. “’I can’t give out loans this week because Doris still owes me money’ that sort of thing. As well as ‘if you don’t pay me this week I’ll put a note on the WhatsApp group about how you owe money’.”

The economic impact of the pandemic means that the IMLT fears there could be an increase in the number of loan-shark victims.

“What we find is that wherever there is financial difficulty then the illegal moneylenders will exploit that to their own advantage” said Quigley.

“But it can take as long as two years for people to come through and ask for help – when people are at their most desperate.”

The IMLT said that in one case a lender allegedly paid a Snapchat influencer to promote its loans.

Another victim was targeted on a dating website where some loan sharks set up profiles offering loans. The woman was tricked into taking out a £3000 loan after revealing she had financial problems. The IMLT said the loan shark demanded £10000 and sexual favours to pay off her debt.

Victims have also described being blackmailed on social sites used by the LGBTQ community by loan sharks threatening to download and share private photographs if they fail to pay their debts.

Those who introduce loan sharks to their victims are also vulnerable Quigley said: “If you introduce somebody to the illegal moneylender and they don’t pay then that debt can be moved to you.”

Charities supporting victims of crime say gangs have been using family debt as a way to force children into county lines drug dealing.

Bali Rodgers the founder of the Safer Communities Alliance a Kent-based community interest company said they had recently supported a 17-year-old whose mother was a drug user.

“She has mental health problems and ran up a £3000 debt and the son has taken responsibility for paying it off by doing county lines drug dealing” she said. “For the gangs it is all about power and control and one of the currencies of control is cash.

“They hold debts over vulnerable people as a way of hot-wiring their entire lives. We have assisted families in south-east London many of whom had to pay back spiralling interest of alleged drug debts for their children.

“This is just the tip of the tip of the iceberg. The coronavirus pandemic has amplified the situation for women. It’s getting worse not better.”

Quigley said the depiction of loan sharks in soap operas most recently an EastEnders storyline where Karen Taylor played by Lorraine Stanley is threatened over a £10000 debt had helped raise awareness of how they operate.

Calvert-Lewin’s clinical 24th-minute strike proved the difference as Everton recorded an 11th Premier League away win of the campaign. The goal was Calvert-Lewin’s 16th in the top-flight this term – only Tottenham Hotspur's Harry Kane has netted more non-penalty goals (17).

The 24-year-old’s match-defining effort was of the highest quality. The England striker raced onto a precision through pass from Ben Godfrey before coolly slotting past Lukas Fabianski in the West Ham goal.

Everton’s attacking threat for the remainder of the game predominantly came on the counter while the Blues also defended with impressive resolve and authority. West Ham were unable to muster a single shot on target at London Stadium.

“It was a tough shift” said Calvert-Lewin who sunk to his knees when the final whistle sounded after a tireless and unselfish centre-forward performance.

“It was about determination hard work and sticking together. That’s what got us the three points.

“We went 1-0 up and we had a few chances. But we mainly sat behind the ball and dug in and worked hard. It wasn’t pretty but I think for the effort we put in we deserved the three points.

“For the goal we knew we’d be able to expose them in behind. So when Richy showed for the ball to feet I’ve just timed my run [in behind the West Ham defence] perfectly – we’ve been working on that in training – and Godders has put a perfect weight of pass in. Then it was just a touch and finish.”

Everton remain eighth in the Premier League but are now just three points behind fifth-placed West Ham and have a game in hand on the east London side.

Carlo Ancelotti’s team will aim to sustain their exceptional Premier League away form when they travel to Aston Villa on Thursday (6pm BST). Only Manchester City and Manchester United have won more points on the road than the Blues' 36 this term.

“Every game is getting more important from now until the end of the season” added Calvert-Lewin.

“We have to keep believing going into every game – and play to win every game because we have to if we want to finish in Europe.

“We’ve gone into matches before with momentum and not taken the three points from them. For me this game’s done – now we need to go into the next game with the same intensity and attitude to go and win.

“The previous matches don’t matter now.

The Norwell Board of Selectmen on Wednesday night approved two licenses for Tesla to operate at 98 Accord Park Road — one for new car sales and one for used car sales.

Town Administrator Peter Morin said the new dealership will be for sales service and delivery of vehicles.

""We think it's a good use of the property"" Morin said.

Morin said Tesla has been eyeing the location since last year but was worried that it would need to apply for a special permit to open a dealership.

Morin said the town tweaked the zoning article for the Accord Park zoning overlay district at the 2020 annual town meeting to make it clear that auto dealerships were a by-right use.

That zoning article which made changes to Accord Park Loop Pond Street and Cordwainer Drive sub-districts also allows 5-story buildings in the Pond Street and Accord Park Loop sub-districts.

""We made a quick fix to the article to make sure it was a right of use and after months we've been successful in getting them in there"" he said.

A Tesla representative who only gave the first name Matt said he is excited for the new dealership to open.

Selectman Jason Brown said he was in favor of the new dealership.

""It's filling a vacant space in the business park"" he said. ""It will be a benefit to the town the businesses and surrounding area. It will bring life and purpose back to the area.""

Brown said every major car brand except Cadillac is already represented in the area. The board unanimously approved the two licenses.

Unlike other car dealerships in Massachusetts Tesla sells directly to the consumer and owns its dealerships a practice that was upheld by the state Supreme Judicial Court in 2014.

A Pennsylvania lawsuit said Tesla was in breach of its contract after raising a Solar Roof price.

The suit filed by Philip Dahlin and Mary Arndtsen said it would seek federal class-action status.

The increase ""was a significant disappointment"" Dahlin told Insider.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

More than half a year after Philip Dahlin and Mary Arndtsen signed a contract with Tesla to install a Solar Roof on their home in New Hope Pennsylvania the couple received a message from the company.

Tesla said their price would now be $78352.66 up from the $46084.80 price they'd agreed upon.

""Our budget was based on the contract that we had so it was not something that we had prepared for"" Dahlin told Insider this week via phone.

Dahlin and Arndsten in late April filed a lawsuit against Tesla in US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The suit said the tech giant was in breach of its contract. It also said the company violated consumer protection acts covering home improvement and trade practices.

The lawsuit was filed amid a growing chorus of customers speaking up about Tesla unilaterally increasing their prices – some by as much as 70% – after they'd signed contracts for Solar Roofs and energy-storage batteries called Powerwalls.

An article in the Uniform Commercial Code allows buyers and sellers to modify agreements after they're signed said D. A. Jeremy Telman a contracts professor at Oklahoma City University School of Law after reviewing the Pennsylvania complaint and a lightly redacted Tesla contract.

""However both parties must consent to the changes. That seems here not to have been the case"" Telman said.

Tesla was issued a summons on May 3 according to the Pennsylvania court. The company had not filed a response as of Saturday afternoon. An email from Insider wasn't returned.

Elon Musk chief executive addressed customer concerns during the company's Q1 earnings call in late April saying ""We did find that we basically made some significant mistakes in assessment of difficulty of certain roofs.""

The lawsuit seeks class-action status

A Tesla rep explains the Powerwall technology.

The Pennsylvania couple's complaint said it would seek class-action status.

Their attorney Peter Muhic of LeVan Muhic Stapleton said he'd heard from ""numerous"" homeowners in situations similar to Dahlin and Arndtsen. He declined to give a specific number.

""They advertise a very unique product that they claim is much better than other competing products"" Muhic told Insider on Thursday. ""And we believe that they need to honor their contracts and they have to perform as they had promised and agreed.""







Muhic would have to file a motion to have the case formally certified as a class action. The complaint said there are more than 100 potential class members who had signed contracts totalling more than $5 million.

A copy of a Tesla Solar Roof contact filed alongside the complaint included an arbitration agreement between the parties. That clause could be a roadblock for the case to gain class-action status said Gregory Klass associate dean and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.

""Tesla's arbitration clause almost certainly forestalls this class action under current Supreme Court precedent"" he said on Friday citing a 2011 case AT&T v. Concepcion.

In the legal complaint Muhic wrote that the arbitration clause would be struck down as invalid under Pennsylvania law in part because of the way it had been formatted on the page. He wrote that the clause also ""does not contain a separate line for each party to indicate assent.""

Connecticut homeowners say Tesla also raised their price

In Weston Connecticut Jay and Robin Fortin signed a contract in January to install a Solar Roof on their 1955 colonial home. They agreed on a price of about $62000 in their contract Jay Fortin told Insider on Friday. His wife signed the contract.

When a tech came to study their home the price jumped up about $6600 because Tesla would have to change the type of wood beneath their shingles he said. Then in April the couple received a message from Tesla letting them know the price had gone up to about $91000.

""I'm not going to pay the new price"" Fortin said on Friday. ""We can't. The whole thing made sense for us because we needed a new roof anyway and we wanted backup power.""

He later added: ""I wish we hadn't gotten involved with the whole thing tell you the truth.""

Fortin said he reached out to Muhic after learning of the complaint. Fortin hasn't taken legal action but said he'd consider joining a class-action lawsuit.

In Pennsylvania Dahlin signed the contract with Tesla for a total price of $46919.20 on September 17 2020 according to a copy filed with the court. The couple paid a $100 deposit. After subtracting the deposit and an energy rebate they would owe $46084.80 after the installation according to the contract.

The couple refinanced their home where they've lived since 2006 to pay for the project. The contract said the roof would be installed within 180 days.

""We were pretty excited about the prospects"" said Dahlin who works in sustainability. ""Also just generating our own energy to charge the Tesla we already had the car.""

During the following 180 days the couple heard little from Tesla.

On March 24 the couple received an email from Tesla saying: ""We have increased the price of Solar Roof and have added adjustments for individual roof complexity.""

On April 23 they learned that the price had been increased to $78352.66 according to their complaint.

Said Dahlin ""And then when we did get the email it was a significant disappointment obviously.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA1LzA4L3RoZXNlLTMtY29tcGFuaWVzLXdpbGwtZ2l2ZS10ZXNsYS1hLXJ1bi1mb3ItaXRzLW1vL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 3 Companies Will Give Tesla a Run for Its Money,"Tesla's built an impressive business. Here are three companies that offer formidable challenges.

Tesla (TSLA -1.74%) is the undisputed leader of the electric vehicle revolution with a stock that is up more than 1300% over the past five years. The company has four vehicle models on the road is building new factories around the globe and continues to develop complementary products including its solar energy system cutting-edge battery technology and autonomous driving system.

The company and the stock has come a long way but there are still challenges up ahead and companies with the potential to knock Tesla back a bit.

Here's why three Fools believe Alphabet (GOOG -1.05%) (GOOGL -1.09%) Ferrari (RACE 1.30%) and Enphase Energy (ENPH -2.23%) are set up well to mount challenges to key parts of Tesla's business in coming years.

The Google car could win the autonomous race

Lou Whiteman (Alphabet): A substantial part of the bull case for Tesla is built around its autonomous tech. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest -- in setting its ambitious $3000 per-share price target on Tesla back in March -- built its argument in part based on its expectations that Tesla in the years to come will be able to launch an autonomous robotaxi service.

Tesla may well get there but there are a lot of other companies exploring autonomous driving that could get there first. Although Alphabet is more known for its Google search engine and YouTube streaming service its Waymo self-driving subsidiary looks like a serious contender for the autonomous crown.

Waymo has taken a slow and steady approach over the years. But the company's tech has progressed far enough that last year it signed a deal with what is now Stellantis (STLA -1.56%) to develop ""Level 4"" autonomous-driving commercial delivery vans.

Level 4 is not fully automated but it is more advanced than the Autopilot Tesla currently has on the roads. And Waymo believes its system (which unlike Tesla deploys laser-based tracking known as lidar in addition to cameras for navigation) is safer than its rival's tech.

I'm not an engineer and won't claim to know for sure which company and technology will win out in the end. But Waymo has a lethal combination of a deep-pocketed backer in Alphabet impressive auto-industry partners like Stellantis and years of development experience to help make its vision of an autonomous future a reality.

If nothing else Waymo is well positioned to provide Tesla with a serious challenge as the tech continues to develop.

The most profitable automaker in the world is (sort of) on sale

John Rosevear (Ferrari): If you think Tesla is too much -- too hyped too expensive too overblown -- then how about the anti-Tesla?

Ferrari isn't exactly an anti-Tesla of course. While its stock-in-trade is its jewel-like high-powered (and thirsty) V-8 and V-12 internal combustion engines the company is in touch with the reality of where the world is going. Ferrari already offers one hybrid model the SF90 Stradale sports car and it's planning to launch a fully electric sports car in 2025.

But Ferrari is unlike Tesla in some important ways. First it's massively profitable with the best operating margins in the auto business (and zero tax-credit sales). Second its sales volumes are tiny and likely to stay that way: While Tesla is hoping to sell a million vehicles a year before long Ferrari is quite content to be selling 10000 or thereabouts.

But auto investors should take note: While Ferrari deliberately limits its annual production to preserve its exclusivity and pricing power it does have a plan to boost its profits and margins. That plan is centered on a series of new models some of which will enter new territory for the brand (there's an SUV-like Ferrari in the works) and some of which will be high-priced limited-production models for Ferrari's most loyal and deep-pocketed fans.

Ferrari announced the plan back in 2018. At the time it said it expected its profits to roughly double by 2022. The company said this past week that COVID-19-related delays have slowed its product-development efforts and it's now pushing that deadline out a year to 2023.

News of the delay hurt the stock but that in turn might create a buying opportunity. Ferrari is still on track to hit its ambitious profit goals -- something that I think some auto investors missed; it's just that the train is going to arrive a bit later than expected.

Of course despite the sell-off Ferrari's stock still doesn't seem cheap at almost 43 times expected 2021 earnings. But if you think of Ferrari as an elite luxury brand (which it arguably is with operating margins around 25%) rather than an automaker the high valuation makes a lot more sense and might even be a bit cheap. And it's a safe bet that Ferrari which will celebrate its 75th anniversary next year and just reported that its order books are at record levels will be around and thriving for a long time yet.

Tesla faces new rivals in one of its fastest growing markets

Rich Smith (Enphase Energy): Everyone knows that Tesla builds electric cars and with $29.5 billion in automotive revenue in 2020 cars are inarguably Tesla's most important business -- for now. As competition ramps up in the electric car space however some analysts are starting to wonder if down the road the real money will be found in Tesla's energy generation and storage business and in particular in its batteries business.

Last month for example investment bank Canaccord Genuity made the case that as Tesla ramps up battery-production capacity beyond what it needs to supply its car business the company will increasingly shift to selling batteries to store solar energy generated by rooftop solar panels and utility-scale solar farms. Between 2020 and 2025 in fact Canaccord predicts that Tesla's battery business will quadruple in size to $8 billion. Moreover the bank forecasts a 25-fold increase in the profitability of the battery business as gross margins achieve the same 25% gross margin it forecasts for Tesla's cars.

And yet just as Tesla faces growing competition in the electric car space so too might it face growing competition from rivals that want a taste of those high profit margins in batteries and solar power. Take Enphase Energy for example. Up until last year Enphase ran in second place to SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG) in market share supplying the ""inverters"" needed to translate direct current solar power from solar panels into the alternating current used to run your A/C and charge your smartphone.

In 2021 however Enphase overtook SolarEdge in market share (now 48% versus 40%) and announced a new ""Encharge 10"" integrated home battery system as well -- a backup battery system that will compete directly with Tesla's own Powerpack offerings. Enphase now competes with Tesla's backup battery offerings in two ways: First it's an alternative to Tesla's in-house developed power inverters -- and a real rival given Enphase's now dominant market share in that business. Second Enphase's introduction of its own battery offering directly challenges Tesla's growth market in backup batteries themselves.

While its victory over Tesla is far from assured Enphase is a stock with momentum in this market -- and a good chance of giving Tesla a run for its money.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3Rlc2xhLWNvbXB1dGVyLWhvdy1pdC1nb3QtaGFja2Vk0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvdGVzbGEtY29tcHV0ZXItaG93LWl0LWdvdC1oYWNrZWQuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Tesla is a computer on wheels so don’t be surprised how it got hacked,"Like any gadget a Tesla is a computer just waiting to get hacked.

In this case it came from a Wi-Fi-enabled drone. The hack – originally meant for the Pwn2Own 2020 hacking competition – involved hacking into ConnMan an internet connection manager. The attacker then took control of a Tesla vehicle’s infotainment system.

Why a Tesla? Because it’s essentially a big mobile computer that can be hacked like any laptop.

""We really designed the Model S to be a very sophisticated computer on wheels"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said back in 2015.

""Tesla is a software company…a huge part of what Tesla is is a Silicon Valley software company. We view this the same as updating your phone or your laptop"" Musk said at the time.

Enter researchers Ralf-Philipp Weinmann of Kunnamon and Benedikt Schmotzle of Comsecuris who found so-called ""zero click"" security vulnerabilities in open-source software used in Tesla cars. That allowed them to hack parked Tesla vehicles from a drone and control their infotainment systems over Wi-Fi.

The vulnerabilities were disclosed late last month by Weinmann and Schmotzle.

In what the researchers described as the ""fun"" part they said the attack can be launched from up to 100 meters above the car by flying the stealth drone to a Tesla Supercharger station.

Once hacked they can then do pretty much anything a user could do from the car’s infotainment system the researchers said. That includes unlocking the doors and trunk adjusting seat positions and changing steering and acceleration modes.

""In short pretty much what a driver pressing various buttons on the console can do"" according to the researchers.

They exploited the fact that modern Tesla vehicles such as the Model 3 automatically connect to a wireless network called ""Tesla Service."" Then they hacked into the ConnMan internet connection manager to gain access to the infotainment system.

""Having control over ConnMan…allows [hackers] to shut down the firewall"" among the other things the researchers said.

And they could have done a lot more. Adding a so-called ""privilege escalation exploit"" to the attack ""would allow us to load new Wi-Fi firmware in the Tesla car turning it into an access point which could be used to exploit other Tesla cars that come into the victim car’s proximity"" the researchers said.

""We did not want to weaponize this exploit into a worm however"" Weinmann said. A worm refers to malware that replicates itself and spreads to other computers.

They later disclosed the vulnerabilities to Tesla who patched them in an update."

While at school he joined school musicals and played lead roles in two of those musicals “Music Man” and “Oliver Twist.” Other than school plays Javier Hugo joined the church choir and learned how to play guitar. His motivation for music was so strong that he sought to participate in a contest called “Valores Juveniles de Monterrey” and received recognition in Nuevo Leon in 1986.

Looking for more opportunities as an artist Valdez settled in Mexico City in 1990 and a year later found a job as a translator for Silvia Pinal Theatre for the musical “Cats” based on the original Broadway show with lyrics adapted to Spanish by Marco Villafán.

Javier Hugo wrote his first song at the age of 9 titled “March Of The Lions.” Despite his young age Javier never stopped writing and in 1987 participated in his first release as a composer in the production of The Powerband’s “Estoy Feliz” recorded at Manny Guerra Studios in San Antonio Texas and in 1994 with the album El Rulis with Raul Alberto from WEA Latina where eight of his songs were included in the album.

In 2018 Javier Hugo recorded his first English song dedicated to the 2018 World Cup soccer games in Russia. That sparked his renewed interest in the music industry and he began planning his first album Palomo Negro in 2019 that was released in January 2020 followed by the single release “Estoy Feliz” in November 2020.

This year will bring a slight change of style with his new cumbia “Todo Me Gusta De Ti” released on May 7.

Workers at the Thermo Fisher site in Perth say they have been “betrayed” after learning almost 250 jobs were under threat this week.

The PA revealed on Wednesday that staff at the facility had been told in a series of meetings that they could be out of work just eight months after a much-heralded extension of the site.

A deal was struck in October to bring 200 jobs to the Fair City to help meet the global demand for COVID-19 tests.

The American science company expanded the site to allow for the manufacture of eight million sample collection tubes a week.

The company was even granted use of Perth Theatre for staff training.

However it is understood workers many of whom left other jobs to move to Thermo Fisher were told that over-production meant their jobs were now being made redundant.

One source told the Perthshire Advertiser that 244 jobs were set to go. Others have revealed security was brought in for the announcements.

As the workers do not have a union the company has asked for staff to come forward to act as representatives during the consultation period.

The situation has left workers feeling devastated with one describing the it as a “nightmare”.

They also revealed staff have been working on what is essentially still a “building site”.

It is understood the site was visited by auditors from British Standards Institute last month which one worker claimed it had failed.

They said: “We have been betrayed.

“We don’t even have a union so they have asked staff to come forward to support other staff and set up a representation group.

“When we went to take these jobs people were leaving other jobs to go there. They sold it as jobs we could be in for years.

“They have completely sold us out. They are very quick to blow their own trumpet but we were warned not to go to the press.

“We’ve been mass producing to the point we have produced ourselves out of jobs but we were pushed to do that.

“How are people supposed to go back in after this and work? We were told our jobs were secure until at least 2023. It’s a nightmare.”

Several emotional staff members contacted the Perthshire Advertiser on Wednesday.

Many had other family members working at the site.

One said: “We’ve been told to stay quiet as this is going to affect the company’s reputation – the company’s reputation won’t pay my bills.

“This is terrible for me. When they were looking for staff they asked everyone to give referrals for friends and family a lot of people quit their jobs because everyone said it was safe and secure. A lot of people took all family for this company and now all of them will lose their jobs.”

In a letter to staff seen by the Perthshire Advertiser staff were told: “Today Thermo Fisher Scientific is announcing proposals to reduce production of COVID-related products manufactured in our Perth Scotland facilities which if approved may reduce the number of employees at the site.”

The letter states that election will take place for employee representation.

The letter claims Thermo Fisher is “committed to doing everything possible to support” workers through the process.

It adds: “Business decisions that may impact employees are not taken lightly. Our Perth team plays a critical role in our pandemic response across the UK and today’s announcement is not a reflection on the quality of your and the Perth team’s work.

“As a company we are committed to being as transparent with you as possible throughout the process and we will communicate any updates with you in a timely manner. We are committed to treating all potentially affected colleagues with the utmost dignity respect and transparency as we support them through this time.”

The news was met with dismay by politicians.

Council leader Murray Lyle had previously hailed the deal for Thermo Fisher to extend the plant calling it the “biggest employment opportunity in Perth in years”.

But this week he told the Perthshire Advertiser : “It is very disappointing given the efforts that everyone – including the whole community – made to accommodate the expansion of the factory and the training that has been given to lots of staff.

“I can understand the anxiety among staff. There are a lot of people employed locally there and it is a real blow.”

Perth and North Perthshire MP Pete Wishart said: “I am extremely concerned to hear this news from Thermo Fisher.

“Last year they expanded and created a number of jobs with great fanfare. The impression given at the time was that these jobs were here to stay and I understand that a number of workers left other positions to take them up.

“I will be seeking an early meeting with bosses to discuss this and see if anything can be done to reduce the impact on the Perth site.”

The Perthshire Advertiser approached Thermo Fisher with the worker’s concerns.

A spokesperson said: “Thermo Fisher Scientific routinely evaluates and adjusts our business capacity to best meet customer needs and societal demands.

“At our Perth site we manufacture products that are critical to COVID-19 testing specifically products that enable the transport of patient samples to laboratories. As we enter the next phase of our pandemic response we are realigning our manufacturing output to meet customer requirements here in the UK.

“As a result Thermo Fisher is proposing to reduce the number of employees at our Perth site in response to evolving customer demands.

“We are beginning consultations with employee representatives at the site. The company is doing everything possible to support our colleagues who may be affected by this proposal.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9vaGlvL25hbWUvZGF2aWQteWVhZ2VyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTkyNDQ4NDbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Yeager Obituary (1960 - 2021) - North Townawanda NY - Akron Beacon Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/ohio/name/david-yeager-obituary?id=9244846 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9vaGlvL25hbWUvZGF2aWQteWVhZ2VyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTkyNDQ4NDbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Richardson has been identified as the man who police shot and killed after he repeatedly rammed his SUV into the front doors of the police station and then allegedly pointed a rifle at police.

Richardson is 24 and lived at 2 Trenton St. in the Cherry Valley section of Leicester.

6:13 a.m. Sunday a 2008 Toyota FJ Base SUV rammed through the locked steel double-doors of the Leicester Police Department according to Worcester District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr.

“He repeatedly rammed those doors until he gained entry with his vehicle into the building” Early said.

“There’s a ramp that goes up to it (the doors) for handicap accessibility” Police Chief Kenneth Antanavica said. “He drove his car up that ramp and repeatedly rammed those doors…Almost the entire vehicle was into the lobby.”

Authorities on Monday identified the man as Richardson.

Early said the suspect had a pending traffic case in Western Worcester District Court on June 1 Early said.

The dispatcher from Worcester Emergency Communication saw the incident occurring in “real time” on the surveillance video and immediately called on-duty Leicester police officers and the officers responded to the scene Early said.

“They were doing their job. They saw it as it happened in real time the video” Early said. “The dispatcher was doing her job and called immediately.

“When the officers arrived at the police station the vehicle was in front of the door” Early said. “The man exited the vehicle and immediately shown what appeared to be a rifle and aimed it at the police officers.”

The police officers fired and shot the suspect Early said.

The officers rendered medical aid to the suspect at the scene. A short time later the man was transported by ambulance to St. Vincent Hospital in Worcester and pronounced dead at the hospital Early said.

“As the thing was pointed at the officers as the officers fired at the man they got down” Early said. “They immediately put him on his side and rendered aid. The EMTs were almost there immediately.”

The front of the police station was heavily damaged. A silver Toyota FJ Cruiser remained at the front entrance throughout the morning as state and Leicester police surveyed the scene.

A short time before the shooting police responded to a call for an alarm going off at Tractor Supply Company just over a mile from the station. A few minutes after telling a dispatcher that things seemed fine at the store the dispatcher radioed officers on patrol to say a car had just crashed into the police station.

""Station 10 to cruisers we have a vehicle that has slammed into the lobby"" she said. ""The vehicle is in the lobby.""

The officers replied that they were on the way as the dispatcher called for the fire department and an ambulance to respond.

The dispatcher said the vehicle appeared to try to ""get out of the lobby then just came back in again.""

Officers announced they were arriving at the station and then about 25 seconds later a gruff voice calls out on the radio ""Suspect's down.""

There is a radio transmission reporting that the ""male party"" is on the ground and secured.

Police request an ambulance to the scene and are told one is already on the way.

An officer asks dispatch to ""contact the lieutenant supervisor on call.""

The ambulance crew requests a paramedic and reports the patient has a gunshot wound.

As part of the Leicester Police Department’s policy Antanavica said an officer involved in “a situation of this magnitude” will be placed automatically on administrative leave.

Two officers were placed on administrative leave Antanavica said.

“You got a guy shouldering a rifle pointing it at the officers” Antanavica said. “We’re very fortunately that no one else was hurt.”

Antanavica said the police have a hard hard job.

“You got a guy that pops out of a truck and he has a rifle pointed at you” Antanavica said. “Their job is so hard. And it’s 6 in the morning and you’re staring at what appears to be a rifle as you show up to a scene. But we’re going to let them do what they got to do. That is probably as much as we can give you at this time.”

No officers were shot Early said.

Early said it “appeared to be a real gun when it was pointed at the officers.”

Antanavica said the state police will conduct the investigation into the shooting.

Antanavica said that the event appears to be an isolated incident and there is no danger to the public at this time.

Stressing that this is “very early into the investigation"" Early said they weren’t going to release ""too much information"" to the public.

The name of the two officers put on administrative leave were not released nor was a possible motive.

The Leicester chief said Monday morning that there was not structural damage to the 15-year-old police station.

The ceremony was held at Truist Stadium in downtown Winston-Salem. The Winston-Salem Dash a minor-league baseball team plays its home games at the stadium.

The college’s administrators faculty members its graduating students and more than 600 people who attended the event observed coronavirus protocols — everyone was required to wear masks and maintain social distancing.

The graduates briefly removed their masks when photographers took their pictures after they received their diplomas.

After the commencement Andraea “Alley” Royal of Wilkesboro described her experience at Salem College as surreal.

“When I started here 3½ years ago I never thought that this day would come” Royal said. “Even with COVID-19 we here have graduated.”

Amid the coronavirus pandemic Salem College postponed its in-person 2020 commencement ceremony and conducted a virtual conferring of degrees on May 23 2020 Salem College officials said in April 2020.

The graduating students gathered Saturday on the stadium’s concourse behind left field. They marched into sections 109 110 111 and 112 and took their seats keeping social distance from each other. They faced the podium that sat on home plate.

Safety nets behind home plate and along the first-base and third-base lines remained in place.

“It’s wonderful to be here face to face without looking through (computer) screens” the Rev. Amy J. Rio the chaplain at Salem College said before she delivered the invocation.

“We know that the past 15 months have been a time of grief loss and pain” Rio said. “While our seniors expected to revel in senior traditions they instead found themselves staring at a screen and physically separated from Salem siblings.”

Since late March 2020 Salem College has conducted remote learning for its students.

“We offer thanks for the endurance that the graduates displayed during these challenging days” Rio said.

Tajuana Batchelor the president of the college’s class of 2021 told the graduates she doubted that Salem would hold an in-person commencement this year.

“We are graduating during a global pandemic” Batchelor said.

After the graduation ceremony Olivia Chipi of Fort Worth Texas said that it was a tiresome experience dealing with remote learning for the past 15 months.

“I want to celebrate this moment” Chipi said.

Dr. Camara Jones of Atlanta Salem’s commencement speaker urged the graduates and the audience to fight against racism. She is an adjunct professor at the Morehouse School of Medicine and the Rollins School of Public Health in Emory University.

Jones a family physician and epidemiologist said she is heartened to know that many U.S. residents realize that racism exists throughout the country. People who saw last year’s Black Lives Matter protests are acknowledging that there is “racism structural racism and systemic racism” Jones said.

“This is heartening because we have to name a problem before we start addressing a problem” said Jones a former medical officer at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Jones also urged the graduates to be courageous and courteous and help build their communities.

“The world is waiting for you” Jones said. “The world needs you. So go out into this world with confidence (and) joy... Know that you matter.”

During the commencement McDara Folan III the chairman of the college’s board of trustees said that the Salem students received a high quality education amid the pandemic.

“We know that Salem has prepared you to run the bases” Folan said.

Meg Sigler the president of Salem’s student government association told the graduates they will always remember the loss of their senior year on campus because of the pandemic.

College officials have taken the proper measures to keep Salem students faculty members and staff safe during the pandemic said Susan Henking the college’s interim president.

Everyone loves pitchers who rake and with Toronto's wounded batting lineup the Blue Jays could use any offensive help they can get.

Blue Jays starting pitchers were seen taking batting practice on Saturday in preparation for Toronto's first interleague series of the season – a three-game set against the Braves beginning Tuesday in Atlanta. The Blue Jays sport a 3-6 record at Truist Park which was opened in 2017.

All three expected starters – Robbie Ray Hyun-Jin Ryu and Ross Stripling – played most of their careers in the National League but with the universal designated hitter in place last season pitchers may be a little rusty at the plate.

Let's look at what to expect from Blue Jays pitchers at the dish.

Hyun-Jin Ryu - .465 Career OPS

Ryu is the best of the bunch. In 258 career regular season plate appearances he rocks a .157/.226/.239 slash line and a 29 OPS+ on par with the free-swinging homerun-hitting New York Mets starter Noah Syndergaard.

Ryu showed off his own sweet swing and a KBO-style bat flip when he hit an electric home run with the Dodgers in 2019 as commentators dubbed him ""Babe Ryu.""

Robbie Ray - .344 Career OPS

Ray's hitting abilities are a step or two below Ryu's. In 263 regular season plate appearances Ray's .146/.160/.185 slash line isn't great even for a pitcher.

With a 44% career strikeout rate he has a fair amount of swing and miss in his game but managed to drill a homerun in a 2016 game with the Arizona Diamondbacks – the only time he’s barreled up a baseball in his career according to Baseball Savant.

Ross Stripling - .226 Career OPS

If you're searching for evidence to strengthen your case for the universal DH look no further than Stripling. In 97 regular season plate appearances he has just eight hits (all singles) and an OPS+ of -37. He's also never barreled up a baseball.

A silver lining of sorts Stripling's 37% strikeout rate is actually quite solid for a pitcher and he even stole a base in 2018.

Bonus: A blast from the past

Jays fans may remember Marcus Stroman's home run off Julio Teheran on May 18 2017. Stroman is the only Blue Jays pitcher to record a hit at Truist Park a stat Toronto is likely hoping to change during this week’s series.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhdHRlcnlwb3dlci5jb20vMjAyMS81LzkvMjI0MjcwMTIvcGhpbGxpZXMtdnMtYnJhdmVzLXByZXZpZXctdGltZS10di1odWFzY2FyLXlub2EtYWFyb24tbm9sYS1zdW5kYXktbmlnaHQtYmFzZWJhbGzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Huascar Ynoa Braves look to clinch series win over Phillies,"Coming off of a big come-from-behind win on Saturday the Atlanta Braves will try to secure a series win over the Philadelphia Phillies on ESPN’s Sunday Night Baseball. Pablo Sandoval delivered a two-out two strike pinch-hit home run in the ninth to send Saturday’s game to extra innings. Then after falling behind 7-4 in the 12th William Contreras tied the game with a bases loaded double. Ehire Adrianza walked it off two batters later with an opposite field single.

Huascar Ynoa has been one of the biggest surprises of the season for the Braves. He allowed four hits and one unearned run over seven innings last time out against the Nationals. He has a 2.36 ERA in 34 1/3 innings this season while holding opponents to a .187 average against. He has struck out 38 and walked just eight.

The Phillies will counter with their ace Aaron Nola who is also off to a great start in 2021. Nola allowed one run five hits and struck out 10 over six innings in his last start against the Brewers. He has a 2.89 ERA and has wracked up 49 strikeouts in 43 2/3 innings so far this season.

Ronald Acuña Jr. left Saturday’s game after he was hit in the hand with a pitch from Sam Coonrod in the seventh inning. X-Rays came back negative and he is considered day-to-day. Freddie Freeman homered in Saturday’s win snapping an 0-for-22 stretch.

First pitch from Truist Park Sunday is scheduled for 7:08 p.m. ET and can be seen on ESPN.

Raised on a family farm in Kansas Tucker Graff graduates in December 2021 from Kansas State University with a bachelor’s degree in feed science and will go on to pursue his master’s degree in grain science.

Depending on where you get your news you might believe in a disturbing trend over the last few years: the meat industry is under attack.

Apparently President Joe Biden wants to limit everyone to one burger a month. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis sparked controversy when he called for a “Meat Out” day on March 20 and the Green New Deal seeks to lower emissions caused by the meat industry.

In response our own U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall got in on the action cosponsoring legislation to prevent federal agencies from banning meat in their cafeterias.

For Kansans these panicked headlines and soundbites hit home. The cattle industry is baked into our cultural identity. You can’t drive down I-70 for any meaningful distance without seeing cattle and Dodge City is famous for its large cattle drives down the Great Western Cattle Trail.

Most people know that almost all of this panic about meat is overblown. Agriculture does emit a large amount of greenhouse gas that we will eventually need to take action on but the Biden administration doesn’t have an official policy of one burger a month.

The people raising the alarm are correct about one thing though. There is a war on beef — but rather than waged by the vegan left it’s being waged by the meatpacking industry against ranchers.

This war is more than a century old and unfortunately the meatpackers are winning.

For those of you unfamiliar with the industry beef is essentially broken up into two sectors: producers (cow-calf operations and feeders) and the meatpacking plants. The packers buy live cattle from the producers and harvest them then that meat makes its way to the store where you the consumer buy it. Prices both for live cattle and for boxed beef are a complicated thing. They can be affected by the cost of feed supply and demand transportation costs and the time of year.

“Price spread” refers to the difference between what retailers pay for a standard box of beef and what processors pay for live beef cattle. It’s an easy way to quantify how much of the profit the meatpackers are taking. Between 2016 and 2018 the average price spread was $21/cwt (cwt=per hundred pounds). During May 2020 that jumped all the way up to almost $280. This happened for a multitude of reasons not least of which is the vice grip that the meatpackers have on the industry.

Four meatpacking companies control the slaughter of more than 80% of American beef: Tyson Foods Cargill Meat Solutions JBS USA and National Beef Packing Co. Unfortunately the price spread has remained alarmingly high long after the market returned to normal after initial disruptions due to COVID-19.

Fortunately people recognize this is a problem.

The USDA investigated the beef industry after the price spread skyrocketed following the August 2019 fire at the Tyson plant in Holcomb Kansas. The agency also investigated prices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately the Trump administration eliminated the agency responsible for protecting farmers from monopolies the Grain Inspection Packers and Stockyards Administration in 2018 — just one of many moves by that administration favoring big corporations over smaller producers.

GIPSA which was set up to oversee the packing companies is now under the control of the Agricultural Marketing Service which was set up to cooperate with packers in order to promote beef. Not surprisingly GIPSA is now largely ineffective.

This isn’t a new problem. In 1919 the Federal Trade Commission found that the “Big Five” companies were illegally manipulating and controlling the price of food in order to defraud farmers and consumers. Regulations were passed but unfortunately the Big Five shrunk to four and business went on as usual.

There’s only one way out of this and that’s by busting the monopoly that the packers have on the industry. It will be painful but we have an obligation to prevent the loss of our cultural and economic identity. If we don’t act now 50 years from now we’ll be having this same conversation but with even fewer ranchers in Kansas and the “Big Three” instead of the Big Four.

Corporations are motivated by profit — ranchers understand that. But there is more than enough profit on the table for everyone to have a share.

It’s exasperating to watch Marshall sponsor pointless legislation and rant about this imaginary version of the “war on beef” while he remains silent as the packing industry guts our family farms strips away our neighbors’ livelihoods and slowly drives ranchers out of business.

(SHAK) Beyond Meat Inc. (BYND) and more.

Trending Economic News

PPP is running out of money but the Restaurant Revitalization Fund has begun accepting applications. The additional $292 billion of Paycheck Protection Program funding will run out before the May 31 deadline. Thus far SBA has approved 10.8 million PPP loan applications. SBA’s Restaurant Revitalization Fund started on May 3.

New homes cost $36000 more because of an epic shortage of lumber. Last year sawmills shut down production amid expectations for construction delays. Now they can hardly keep up with pend-up demand. Lumber futures soared above $1525 per 1000 board ft. from $500 last November.

Brazil’s central bank (BCB) raised its benchmark interest rate to fight inflation. Higher energy prices have pushed inflation above the bank’s target ceiling. BCB increased the rate by 0.75% and expects to raise it again next month. YTD BCB lifted interest rate from 2% in Jan to 4.25% by Jun. Consumer prices rose 6.17% in the year through mid-April and many economists forecast 8% by May.

Hiring accelerated in April but still fell short of expectations. ADP reported private payrolls grew by 742K in April below forecast of 800K. It was the fastest pace of labor market recovery since September amid an increase in COVID-19 vaccinations and the lifting of business restrictions. The service-providing sector added 636K jobs led by leisure & hospitality (237K).

India’s second COVID wave may have a bigger impact on the global supply chain than many realize. India’s pharmaceutical industry is the third largest in the world and produces 70% of the world’s vaccines (note: not COVID vaccines). India also provides IT back-office and other non-core operations for companies around the globe. Most indicators suggest the economic impact of COVID is less severe than last spring but recovery will be delayed to 2022.

Born: June 1971 in Washington D.C.

Education: American University 1989-1992

Career: Carlson Wagonlit Travel travel agent 1994-1998; The Baking Company owner and pastry chef 2007-2011; Challenge Discovery team building facilitator 2012-2016; Summer Classics owner December 2020-present

Where in the metro area do you live? Glen Allen

Best business decision: “I took a big risk of purchasing a business during a pandemic but Summer Classics has been thriving as people have been adapting to new ways to incorporate functionality into their homes.”

Worst business decision: “My husband Scott and I became owners of Summer Classics in December 2020 and we’ve been fortunate to have not made any major negative business decisions yet. Some would say purchasing a business during a pandemic is a bad business decision. But we’re so thankful Summer Classics has been well received and supported by the local community. The reality is that there are always minor hiccups that come with owning a business. But there are no mistakes just learning opportunities.”

Mistake you learned the most from: “When I make a mistake small or large I face it head-on to remedy my mistake and learn from it. I tend to not focus on bad decisions or mistakes. I instead think to myself ‘How am I going to make this right for the customer?’ For instance there are circumstances when a customer’s furniture doesn’t come in on time. In that case I happily let the customer borrow any piece of furniture off the Summer Classics showroom floor until their furniture does arrive. It’s the little things that can go a long way in putting the customer first and setting their minds at ease.”

First job after college: Travel agent at Carlson Wagonlit Travel

If you had to do it all over again what would you do differently: “I wouldn’t say I’d do anything differently but my biggest struggle as a business owner is managing all the different tasks that come with owning a business and making sure nothing goes untouched. I sometimes have too many balls in my court and want to make sure that none of them drop. I’ve had to readjust my way of thinking to only focus on one thing at a time and to understand that it’s OK if I don’t have all the answers. That’s what having an amazing team of employees is for. If I don’t have the answers I know that they will.”

Book that inspired you the most and why?: “The Pie And Pastry Bible” and “The Cake Bible” by Rose Levy Beranbaum. “In my spare time I enjoy baking and cooking as a way of spoiling friends and family. Plus it’s relaxing.”"

But instead many users found themselves unable to access their bank account at all as BBVA’s website returned an assortment of error messages from “system error” to warnings that their account information was mismatched.

The transition has gone so poorly that BBVA’s US website now opens on a large red banner warning users of extended customer service wait times. Anyone who visits the Simple transition page will see a different red banner apologizing for the issues.

“To Simple customers converting to BBVA: This has not been a good conversion experience for many of you” part of the message reads. “We know this and we sincerely apologize.”

A banner on BBVA’s transition page for Simple customers.

Simple opened to customers in 2012 and was supposed to offer a digital-first approach to banking. In fewer words it was supposed to be “a bank that doesn’t suck” to quote one of its co-founders. The service had a website and app that broke down your spending and made it easy to categorize payments send money and set savings goals. It was purchased by BBVA in 2014.

BBVA said in January that it would be shutting down Simple later in 2021. The decision came from the company “reassessing its goals” as part of a planned sale to PNC Bank which reached an agreement to acquire BBVA’s US operations in November 2020. The acquisition has not yet closed.

Accounts were successfully transitioned from Simple to BBVA on Saturday but technical issues prevented customers from logging in a BBVA spokesperson told The Verge. That led to a cascading series of problems. “Due to the volume of customers attempting to enroll in mobile and online banking simultaneously there were technical difficulties with the enrollment process leading to high call volume in our call centers which overwhelmed the system and created longer than normal wait times” the spokesperson said.

Debit cards ATMs checks and scheduled transactions still functioned properly according to the spokesperson. Though online and mobile account access remains unavailable for users encountering issues.

“We know this conversion process was not smooth for our incoming Simple customers and we sincerely apologize to them” the spokesperson said. “We are working to make it right including extending hours in our call center and adding staff to handle the incoming calls.”

It seems that some people have been able to gain access to their accounts after waiting or working with BBVA’s customer service. Judging by reactions on Twitter from Simple’s very online user base plenty of people still don’t have access though and have been unable to get help from BBVA’s customer service.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzU0N2E0ZGMyLWUxMWItNGU4Zi1iNTI2LWNiZjEzNWJhN2I0ZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US and Europe split on bringing bankers back to the office,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

A man who allegedly held five people captive during an eight-hour standoff at a Wells Fargo bank in St. Cloud Minnesota wanted a “big show” authorities said.

Those held hostage in the bank said the suspect wanted the robbery to “go viral” and wanted to be a “martyr” according to a criminal complaint filed in Minnesota district court Friday.

Ray Reco McNeary 35 has been charged with one count of aggravated robbery five counts of kidnapping and one count of assault in the second degree. CNN is working to confirm if McNeary has an attorney.

St. Cloud Police Chief Blair Anderson said the situation found “the best possible outcome we could have had” Thursday when four of the hostages were released or escaped and a fifth hostage “made a run for the door” right as tactical units from the St. Cloud Police Department and the FBI simultaneously entered and arrested McNeary without incident.

All of the hostages were bank employees according to police. They are uninjured and are safely at home said St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis.

Details of the standoff are released by authorities

The complaint states that McNeary arrived at the bank on Thursday upset about alleged fraud on his account. When the bank manager brought McNeary into his office the account could not be located which made him even more upset.

McNeary was demanding money and to speak with the FBI when a silent panic alarm was pushed a short while later the complaint said.

St. Cloud officers were called to the bank around 2 p.m. CT for reports of a possible robbery in progress St. Paul police said.

McNeary physically forced the bank manager “toward the bank vault where he was provided with a large amount of cash which was placed in a bag” and given to him the complaint said. During this time the manager felt an object pressed into his back according to the complaint. McNeary also allegedly grabbed the manager’s wrist very hard causing an injury.

McNeary told the manager and the other hostages that “he was going to harm them and that he wanted a ‘big show’ with the FBI and lots of media and he’d take the victims ‘with him’” according to the complaint. Another person who was also directed to the vault said that McNeary wanted this to “go viral” and that he wanted to be “a martyr.”

After receiving the cash McNeary threw “large amounts of it all over inside the bank then began taking victim’s phones and damaging them by slamming them into objects or putting them in water” according to the complaint.

McNeary held four people in the lobby as another person who had been hiding in an adjacent office was communicating with law enforcement from inside the office until his cell phone battery ran out according to the complaint. Shortly after McNeary acquired a key card and discovered the person who had been hiding forcing him out into the lobby area with the other hostages.

“Throughout the crisis McNeary became more escalated. Witnesses described McNeary as threatening them referring to them as ‘hostages’” read the complaint.

McNeary specifically stated that he would use the bank manager as a shield and they would “die together” according to the complaint.

“McNeary told both hostages and law enforcement that he intended to kill the hostages kill himself or put law enforcement in a position that they would kill him” the complaint said.

McNeary later placed scissors in front of the manager’s neck and stated “I will have to shiv you” according to the complaint. McNeary then allegedly pushed him to the ground and told him “If you move I swear to God I’ll stab you.”

As one of the hostages moved quickly toward the front door of the bank McNeary tried to stop her but she managed to push past him and get out at approximately 7:09 pm the complaint said. The three other employees – except for the bank manager – were later allowed to leave.

After more than eight hours negotiators had been able to communicate to the bank manager “that law enforcement entry teams from both the St. Cloud Police Department and the FBI were directly outside the front door prepared to enter.” As authorities entered according to the complaint the manager ran for the front door and McNeary was apprehended.

McNeary did not have a firearm and none were found at the scene St. Cloud police said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW1waW9ubmV3c3BhcGVycy5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbl9hbmRfY29tbWVudGFyeS9jaGlub19tZW1vcmllcy9hcnRpY2xlXzI1MjYwMjgwLWFmNGEtMTFlYi04MGYwLTZiMjllMTA4NGUzOS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The ornate bank building | Chino Memories | championnewspapers.com,"×

[2021],"Virtually every time you apply for a line of credit such as a credit card your credit report will be hit with a credit pull. But not every credit pull is equal and not every credit pull affects all of your credit scores.

This comprehensive article will first explain what credit pulls are and the difference between hard pulls and soft pulls. I’ll then show you how to find out which credit bureau (Experian TransUnion or Equifax) a bank will pull from when you apply for a credit card by utilizing credit databases.

What are credit pulls?

Credit pulls are when an entity usually a lender “pulls” your credit report to review your creditworthiness (i.e. how likely it is that you will responsibly borrow and pay back funds).

There are two different types of credit pulls: “soft pulls” and “hard pulls.” Knowing the difference between these two is very important.

Soft pulls

Soft pulls do not affect your credit score.

These can be done by lenders for things like pre-approvals but they are probably most commonly done when you check your credit score using something like Credit Karma or other times when something like a background check is done on you.

Hard pulls

Hard pulls are just like soft pulls except that they do affect your credit score. These are almost always done when you apply for a credit card or for any type of financing (home loans car loans etc.). And they can even happen for things like utilities and cell phones.

Unlike soft pulls you want to limit hard pulls because they affect your credit score as explained in more detail below.

How do credit pulls affect your credit score?

It’s really helpful to understand how credit pulls (hard pulls) affect your credit score.

Hard pulls affect the “New Credit” category of your FICO score which accounts for only 10% of your total credit score. Below is how your credit score is determined:

Payment History (35%)

Utilization (30%)

Credit History (15%)

New Credit (10%)

Mixed Credit (10%)

Each time your credit report is pulled your credit score will likely drop a few points typically 3 to 5 points. For people with more established credit profiles this drop might be even smaller. For people with weak credit scores this drop could be larger (even over 10 points.)

The good news is that your score will bump back up over the course of a few weeks or months. After 12 months the credit pull won’t even effect your FICO credit score and after two years it will drop off entirely. To read more about how hard inquiries affect your credit score click here.

Why does it matter which credit bureau will be pulled?

You might be wondering why it even matters which credit bureau will be pulling your credit score. Well there are a few important reasons why it matters.

Mitigate damage to your credit report

It’s important to give your credit report a break every now and again. By alternating credit bureaus pulled you’ll be able to mitigate the dings to your credit report.

For example if you have three recent hard inquiries on your Experian report and you can choose to apply for a card that will pull from only TransUnion that will allow you to give your Experian score a break.

Minimize appearance of hard pulls

Many credit card issuers don’t like to see a dozen plus inquiries over the past year or two so by trying to go for certain bureaus you can minimize the appearance of being a credit savage.

Using the same example as above if you were to apply to a bank that pulls TransUnion they would not technically see your recent Experian inquiries. So it would not look like you are aggressively pursuing credit as much as you are which is a good thing.

Utilizing your “cleanest” credit report

Some banks will not approve you if you have negative marks like late payments or collections on your credit report. So by knowing which banks pull which credit bureau you can avoid those banks at least until more time passes and your negative marks don’t mean as much.

It is not uncommon for derogatory remarks or certain types of negative reports on your credit to only be reported to one or two bureaus. Some banks will deny you even if those negative marks are very old. So if you have one report clean from any negative marks and you can rely on that one report for a credit card application that can help you get approved.

Utilize your highest credit score

Sometimes your credit score can vary dramatically between the bureaus in which case you’d obviously want to go for banks who might use your higher score.

Remember that just because one or two credit bureaus are pulled your new account will still likely show up on all three of the major credit bureaus. This is great because if you only have one good credit report like TransUnion you can leverage that one to get new cards which will eventually boost the score of your other credit reports!

Are credit pulls worth it?

Credit pulls are absolutely worth it when you’re able to secure a much-needed loan or pick up one of the best rewards credit cards.

When you’re earning hundreds (or even thousands of dollars) in credit card rewards a short-term ding on a credit report is well worth it.

How to find out which credit bureau will be pulled

The truth is that all we have are imperfect tools to work with to determine which credit bureau will be pulled.

With that said we also have certain trends that we can base our predictions on. These trends and tools can at least help us make an educated guess as to which bureau will be pulled.

I’ll start by identifying which credit card issuers are known for pulling certain bureaus and then get into the different methods for figuring out which bureau will be pulled by using databases.

Credit card issuer trends

The information below is based on my experience with dealing with these issuers for myself and for many others over the past few years. It’s also based on a review of the data found in CreditBoards. Understand that your experience could differ greatly from my findings below.

American Express

American Express loves to pull Experian.

For every single one of my Amex issued credit cards over the past few years they have always pulled from Experian (and only Experian). However sometimes they can mix it up and pull from another bureau like TransUnion. But if you apply for an Amex card you can almost always count on Experian being pulled.

Note: If you are a current Amex customer they typically only do a soft pull if they reject you for a credit card and sometimes only do a soft pull when they approve you!

Barclaycard

Barclaycard is great because they usually pull from TransUnion. This allows you to give your other credit reports a break as they’ll sometimes only pull from TransUnion (bot not always).

Capital One

Capital One likes to invite everybody to the party and they pull from each of the three credit bureaus. In the past you could freeze one bureau like Experian to save yourself the hard pull but recent data points show that’s not always successful.

This “freezing” technique can work for other credit card issuers too. But you need to pay close attention to what works and what doesn’t since these type of things can be in flux sometimes. For more info on this check out the DOC’s article here.

Chase

Chase is a hard one to predict. I’d say expect an Experian pull and one additional bureau but it could be very location-specific.

Citibank

Citibank will mostly pull from Experian and Equifax and in rare cases TransUnion. Expect for Citi to pull from at least two credit bureaus.

As you can tell it’s hard to pinpoint which bureau will be used for the credit pulls. But you can use the tool below to narrow your focus by region and potentially get a more accurate idea of what to expect.

Creditboards Credit Pull Database

The Credit Pull Database on Creditboards.com is the most popular source for checking which credit bureau will pull your credit for a credit application.

The key is to remember that the data you’ll find is usually self-reported. This means that it could be inaccurate outdated or perhaps even anomalous data that doesn’t accurately represent a given segment of society.

But that’s okay because at least we have guiding posts for the data on credit pulls.

As long as you always remember that the data you’re relying on may not be 100% correct in every scenario you won’t be surprised if your experience doesn’t accord with the data you found.

Using the Credit Pull Database

The Credit Pull Database is extremely easy to use.

Just click on this link and you’ll be able to search by the following criteria:

Consumer State

Credit Reporting Agency

Date applied

Approved

You do not have to select all of the details. I selected Texas and Equifax and found credit pulls data points for the following banks:

NFCU

Wells Fargo

Discover

PenFed

US Bank

USAA

Chase

In addition to the credit bureau data you can also see other relevant data points. You can see user details like:

The applicant’s ZIP Code

The date applied

Whether or not they were approved for the credit card

Their credit score

Credit limits

Random comments

The comments can be really helpful because you can find out if people were approved with things like bankruptcies on their credit report. Also if there were multiple credit bureaus pulled sometimes people will report them in the comments.

Alternative methods for finding credit pulls

Reddit spreadsheet

The folks over at Reddit have put together a spreadsheet with credit card application data. The spreadsheet includes even more criteria than CreditBoards such as income average age of accounts and how many accounts have been opened in the past 3 6 and 12 months.

This data is incredibly useful but may not be as voluminous as CreditBoards.

The data also might be skewed in favor of people with better credit scores since I imagine the demographics of those who frequent that forum are from more affluent sectors of society or at least have better credit scores.

Personal credit reports

You can also search your own credit reports to see which credit bureaus were pulled in the past. The issue with this is they they won’t show up beyond 2 years. Also the credit bureaus could change what bureaus they pull from.

You can check your credit score for free with Credit Karma (TransUnion and Equifax) and FreeCreditReport.com (Experian).

Credit card issuers who do soft pulls

Outside of the Amex exceptions mentioned above there aren’t many other issuers that will conduct a soft pull of your credit when applying for a credit card.

So what can you do?

You can try out something called the “Shopping Cart Trick.”

There are a few steps that you’ll need to follow but if you’re successful it’s actually possible to get approved for a credit card without ever having a hard pull on your credit card. It’s not going to be a huge credit line but at least it’s something.

Read more about how that method works here. Note that this method does not work as much as it used to.

Credit limit increases

Before you ever request a credit limit increase from a bank make sure you inquire with whether or not they conduct a hard pull on your credit report.

Amex

American Express will not conduct a hard pull when you request a credit limit increase. To request an increase you typically want your account to be open for 60 to 90 days and will likely shoot for an increase of 2X to 3X your credit. If you would like to find out more about how to request a credit limit increase with American Express click here.

Barclays

Barclays will usually do a hard pull when you request a credit limit increase but they are pretty generous when it comes to auto increases.

Capital One

Capital One will conduct a soft pull. You can find out more about how to get a credit increase with a Capital One here.

Chase

Chase will conduct a soft pull — read more about getting Chase credit limit increases here.

Citi

Citi will do both hard pulls and soft pulls but they should notify you beforehand. Just call the number on the back of your card to inquire with a rep of whether or not you’ll get a hard pull or soft pull. Read more about Citibank credit limit increases here.

Discover

The process varies for Discover. If they accept your initial request that’s usually a soft pull but if you’re trying to get a larger credit line increase then that could result in a hard pull.

Final word

In the end you’ll probably have to leave some of this stuff up to chance.

But it’s still a good idea to check these resources out so that you can at least give it a shot at trying to navigate your way through the hard pull landscape. Even if you only get it right 50% of the time those instances could still work in your advantage and allow you to minimize damage to your credit score."

AUSTIN Texas — Uber is taking a stance against domestic violence and teaming up with the Texas Council on Family Violence to provide free rides to domestic violence victims.

""Transportation should never be a barrier to seeking help for domestic violence"" said Chris Miller Uber's senior manager of public affairs.

Access to this service is critical especially now. During the pandemic multiple domestic violence organizations reported an uptick in calls and other communications from victims.

SAFE a Central Texas nonprofit that helps survivors of violence and abuse reported a 14% increase in calls chats and texts to its 24/7 SAFELine from March 1 2020 to February 28 2021 compared to the same time frame the previous year.

""This is part of a larger commitment to combat gender-based violence"" Miller said. ""This year globally will be donated over $2.5 million to combat gender-based and domestic violence which is just been exacerbated as a lot of people know with the stay-at-home [orders] and COVID.""

The rides will be split among seven domestic violence programs in the state including Asian Family Support Services of Austin. Each group will be set up with its own Uber account where staff and volunteers can send victims a voucher for a free ride or call the ride on their behalf.

""We will continue to work to encourage everyone in their community to be involved"" Miller said.

If you or someone you know need access to this program visit tcfv.org or contact the national domestic violence hotline at 1-800-799-7233.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vaW52ZXN0b3JwbGFjZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS81LWN5Y2xpY2FsLXN0b2Nrcy1oZWF0aW5nLXVwLWZvci1zdW1tZXJ0aW1lLXViZXItY2NsLWRpcy1sdXYtdGp4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Cyclical Stocks All Set to Heat up for a Blockbuster Summer,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsbmV3cy5jYS9uZXdzLzc4NDI1NjcvdWJlci1jYW5hZGEtZHJpdmVycy10YXhpLWJ1c2luZXNzL9IBSWh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsbmV3cy5jYS9uZXdzLzc4NDI1NjcvdWJlci1jYW5hZGEtZHJpdmVycy10YXhpLWJ1c2luZXNzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COMMENTARY: How Uber contributed to the fate of taxi drivers,"Send this page to someone via email

Countries around the world are wrestling with whether to classify Uber drivers and other gig economy workers as independent contractors or employees.

But when Uber first came on the scene the primary subject of debate was whether its drivers were in fact taxi drivers. Why was this ride-sharing or ride-hailing app run by a tech firm also applying to be a taxi company? Was Uber truly “the same as a taxi but different?”

We’ve studied how Uber and taxi drivers have been affected by Uber’s categorization as a technology company. As organizational and management researchers at business schools from across Canada studying stigma marginalization and inequality as well as entrepreneurship innovation and technology we became very interested in Uber’s entry into the taxi industry as we watched it unfold.

In Toronto Uber was eventually legalized in 2016 after “months of protest and turmoil” and years of debate while it operated illegally.

But when we began studying Uber’s entry into Toronto we noticed something concerning. There was increasing praise in the media for Uber and Uber drivers but criticism and near-contempt for taxis and taxi drivers.

How were two groups of people doing the same work every day — driving other people to their desired destinations — being perceived so differently? As one Uber driver told us in an interview: “I don’t see the difference. … There is no difference between each other.” But it seemed the media and Uber disagreed.

Toronto is home to the largest taxi driver population in the country with more than 10000 drivers over 80 per cent of them immigrants. Unfortunately taxi drivers in Toronto have historically faced racism classism and stigma. More broadly taxi driving has also been called “dirty work.”

The work of late Canadian-born sociologist Erving Goffman and subsequent research have shown that stigma transfers by association. This would suggest that Uber drivers would become stigmatized by virtue of entering the field of driving just as taxi drivers are. But we didn’t see this happen for Uber drivers.

The email you need for the day's top news stories from Canada and around the world.

To make sense of this we conducted an in-depth case study of Uber’s entry and expansion into Toronto from 2013 to 2016. We analyzed 976 media articles and conducted 55 interviews after walking the streets of Toronto and ordering Ubers to find real drivers.

We also conducted observations at protests panel discussions and city hall meetings to better understand what was happening on the ground.

Based on this data we wrote and published an open-access article in the Journal of Management Studies where we argue that new entrants to a stigmatized occupation can actually deflect stigma. But how does this happen?

Story continues below advertisement

Uber’s perceived categorical ambiguity — as seen in the surge of debates over how to label Uber and its drivers — paved a path to differentiate Uber drivers from taxi drivers through two activities.

First Uber spokespeople public officials and media created a categorical distinction by pointing to technology to explain why “Uber is not a taxi company.”

Second they highlighted differences between the perceived identities of Uber drivers and taxi drivers often emphasizing that Uber drivers were driving short-term and part-time. Yet this didn’t necessarily reflect reality. As one Uber driver told us in an interview:

“I start at 7 a.m. and I finish at 7 p.m. Twelve hours. I try to work Monday to Friday because I have family and I have one daughter. … I want to enjoy the summer but sometimes I work on Saturday at night.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""I start at 7 a.m. and I finish at 7 p.m. Twelve hours. I try to work Monday to Friday because I have family and I have one daughter. … I want to enjoy the summer but sometimes I work on Saturday at night.""

These categorical distinctions and perceived differences in identities helped Uber drivers deflect the stigma of taxi driving despite many Uber drivers even acknowledging they did the same thing as their taxi counterparts.

Story continues below advertisement

Meanwhile the stigma facing taxi drivers got worse. As distinctions and differences circulated in the media they were accompanied by remarks anchored in prejudice tied to the social moral and physical characteristics of taxi drivers.

These remarks degraded taxi drivers to the benefit of Uber drivers often emphasizing and juxtaposing the immigrant status languages hygiene and working conditions of taxi drivers compared to Uber drivers. Media coverage also often emphasized taxi industry features that were mandated and regulated by the city and not taxi drivers themselves.

The media reported on the convenience of the new Uber app and its automatic credit card payment process even though Uber was operating illegally — and as several taxi companies launched their own apps to “help riders commute hassle-free.”

By the time Uber was legalized as a “private transportation company” and the distinctions between Uber drivers and taxi drivers were formalized it wasn’t just that taxi drivers faced economic hardships. They also argued there was a “two-tier system” and Uber drivers and taxi drivers became polarized in the media.

“It’s really severely marginalizing my existence” one driver told us.

“I feel like I’m coming to the bitter end. I feel like that guy in the orange jumpsuit who is on his knees and a guy from ISIS is standing over me except the guy in the black suit there is an Uber guy with a machete in his hand.”

Uber’s entry into Toronto divided an occupation and exacerbated the social and economic hardships of taxi drivers. And it all started with how Uber and Uber drivers were categorized.

Rarely more so than in the case of Anthony Tan – originator of the Asian “super-app” Grab which having proved “an Uber killer” in its home markets is now readying for a $35bn-$40bn Wall Street float in the largest special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal yet seen.

Tan’s mother was one of the first investors in Grab’s Malaysian forerunner MyTeksi – the online taxi-booking service founded by the youthful entrepreneur in 2012 says the BBC. She was also pivotal to the app’s acceptance among institutional investors. “We saw how he spent time with his mum how he talked to her and how much respect he gave her” says Kee Lock Chua of Vertex Ventures. “That told us he had strong character and conviction. Besides the solid idea that helped us make the decision to invest in the business.” Chua’s firm paid $11m for a 22% stake in Grab: by the time he exited seven years later it was worth “more than ten times that amount” – a measure of the company’s mushrooming growth as it expanded beyond taxis into food delivery insurance payments and lending across eight countries to become Southeast Asia’s most valuable start-up.

“The eye-popping numbers give a sense that Tan is blazing a trail for the entire region” says the Financial Times. That is “very much in character”. Born into one of Malaysia’s wealthiest families Harvard-educated Tan now 39 has always been “unabashedly ambitious” proclaiming just two years after founding the company that “if we get this right we can literally go into the history books”. According to a lawyer whose firm works for Grab “Anthony always wants to be number one”. He’s also spiritually driven citing Jesus Christ as a business hero and describing his job as a “mission” to serve Southeast Asians’ needs.

It could all have been very different notes a Harvard Business School profile. As a scion of the family behind Tan Chong Motor one of Malaysia’s biggest car distributors Tan was expected to join the family business. But he was bitten by the entrepreneurial bug while at Harvard. Challenged by a classmate he came up with a plan to revamp the Malaysian taxi market.

Only connect

It’s perhaps Tan’s unique mix of connections – he was “heavily influenced” by meetings with tech founders such as YouTube’s Steve Chen and “lean start-up” gurus – that has done most to fuel Grab’s growth says the FT. Supporters say it took someone like him “to navigate Southeast Asia’s interlinked world of politics and business”. But he’s never lost touch with street life. Now married and living in Singapore he can often be seen eating cai fan (a cheap rice dish) in shopping malls. That familiarity with business on the ground helped in the epic battle to oust Uber. While the latter was seen as a competitive threat by local cab drivers Grab was perceived as an ally. Thus when Tan decided to leverage Grab’s customer-base and offer financial services it was viewed more as a helpful evolution than a power grab says the BBC.

That said the risks to Grab are mounting. There’s a danger that local governments will emulate China’s crackdown on e-commerce giants getting into digital banking. More imminently he faces the challenge of debuting on Wall Street “just as institutional enthusiasm for SPACs is waning and short-sellers are circling” says the Financial Times. “Anthony is a street fighter” says a former employee. He may need to be."

The deal which values Beautycounter at $1 billion will help increase the skin care and cosmetics company’s brand awareness and bolster its omnichannel business model.



Current leadership including Chief Executive Gregg Renfrew will remain in place.

Renfrew who previously served as chief executive of children’s retail group Best & Co. in Greenwich Conn. founded Counter Brands in 2011. She debuted a line of nine products two years later including facial cleansers eye creams and shampoo.



“In 2013 I launched Beautycounter with the simple mission to get safer products into the hands of everyone” Renfrew said in a statement.



The acquisition she added is an “exciting and important milestone for our company … toward achieving that mission. I have long admired … the team at Carlyle for their experience working with brands at the intersection of cultural relevance and consumer demand and believe that our combined vision will be instrumental in accelerating Beautycounter as the leader in clean beauty and in the beauty industry as a whole.”



Beautycounter a certified B Corp. now sells more than 100 products that are nontoxic and eco-friendly. It refrains from using some 1800 “questionable or harmful ingredients” in product formulations which is “well beyond the 30 banned by U.S. law” according to the company.



The company’s distribution channels include ecommerce; brick-and-mortar stores in Venice New York and Denver; and a seasonal pop-up in Nantucket Mass.



The company also has a sales force of some 65000 independent consultants who keep 25% to 35% of their sales. The brand paid about $120 million last year on commissions which puts its revenue from sales consultants at about $400 million. Annual revenue also includes short-term product placements at Sephora and Target stores.



The brand has undertaken several fundraising rounds including $65 million in 2018 which was led by Mousse Partners Ltd. a New York-based family office that also invested in Ulta Beauty Inc. and Bonobos Inc.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2RldHJvaXQuY29tL2F3YXJkcy9kYW5pZWxsZS1ib3llci0yMC10aGVpci0yMHMtMjAyMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Danielle Boyer - 20 in their 20s 2021,"Danielle Boyer designed a robot that costs less than $20 to manufacture and her nonprofit gives it away to students who want to participate in the notoriously costly robotics arena.

Boyer founded the STEAM Connection — using an acronym for science technology engineering art and math — in early 2019 when she was 18 years old. It aims to make science and technology learning accessible for youth of various backgrounds including through connections in national indigenous community organizations. Boyer is an Ojibwe citizen.

The nonprofit run by volunteers with an annual budget of around $50000 has donated more than 15000 books and 4500 robotics kits so far. One recent funder is Ulta Beauty Inc. which contributed $5000.

Boyer 20 created her robot named EKGAR (Every Kid Gets a Robot) to be easy to fit together and learn from. She sends it to robotics teams nonprofits and individuals.

Boyer doesn’t have a patent for the uniquely designed robot — yet. It could cost more than $10000 and that’s not feasible right now.

The nonprofit also has an online learning platform and an open-source robot educators can use that’s got a more advanced design than the proprietary EKGAR.

Boyer who grew up mostly in Troy learned to love science and technology education when at age 10 she noticed that her home-school group didn’t offer many such classes. She decided to teach an animal science class to kindergarteners.

“I thought it was so much fun but I also learned that there’s a giant accessibility gap in specifically tech education” she said. “A lot of the resources are way too expensive for many students to afford and I wanted it to be different.”

It can cost more than $500 for a single robot that’s often used on robotics teams she said and she has paid $400 to be on a single team.

Boyer first garnered support and funding from Dassault Systèmes SE whose Waltham Mass.-based subsidiary Solidworks Corp. makes the software she used to design her STEAM Connection robot. She said the company “discovered” her at a robotics competition leading her to give a keynote speech in Boston as part of Solidworks’ User Advocacy Day at age 17.

Boyer now mentors 35 robotics teams and partners and fundraises with organizations including the Navajo-owned New Mexico-based Little Moccasins Education Services LLC and the national nonprofit American Indian Science and Engineering Society whose work includes assisting indigenous students in STEM.

There’s more coming too. Boyer has a new invention in the works that she’s vague about but says it “intersects robotics and biodegradability.” Another new project is a “Tech and Tradition” series.

“It’s showcasing students who are in engineering who are in science in our traditional cultural regalias and the idea is for students with similar cultural backgrounds to be able to look at these images and these posters and resonate with it and feel like they belong in STEAM in general because most students don’t ever get to feel that way” Boyer said.

Barring rare circumstances your non-permanent hair dye just won’t last forever no matter what you do. That said there are expert tips on how to make temporary hair color last longer so you can get the most mileage per jar. “How long your color lasts directly depends on how you care for it” says LA hairstylist Megan Schipani.

According to the pro you should always wash your hair with cold water — “I know it's not fun but it is the most important tip” — and limit how often you wash in general. “I recommend one to two times a week at the most especially for curly or textured hair because it generally lacks moisture and washing too frequently just strips the natural oils ever further” Schipani explains. When you do wash use color-depositing formulas or sulfate-free and color-safe shampoos co-washes and conditioners. “For curly and textured hair that may be craving extra moisture you can rinse 60% to 80% of the conditioner out and leave the rest in for an extra kick of moisture and repair and then style as usual” Schipani recommends.

It also matters how you apply the dye and which one you use — a spray-on hair tint applied to naturally dark hair isn’t going to last as long as a semi-permanent dye on top of blonde hair for example.

Kylie Cosmetics Instagram Page Is Almost Empty

Fans of Kylie Jenner were shocked when they noticed that the Kylie Cosmetics Instagram page was close to empty with only a picture of her left. The picture was captioned with “something is coming.” Te website also says “SOMETHING. IS. COMING.” It doesn’t look like the end of Kylie’s brand. In fact this is just the beginning of something new. Kylie Cosmetics seems to be in the middle of a huge rebrand. Fans of Kylie Jenner also noticed that all Kylie Cosmetics product at Ulta either comes with a heavy discount or is sold out.

What Is Kylie Jenner Up To?

It was announced in 2020 that Kylie Jenner would sell 51 percent of Kylie Cosmetics to Cody. This gave the KUWTK star an impressive paycheck – $600 million out of the sale. Kylie still owns half of te company but selling a part of it lets her focus on the creative and development side.

MEACHAM Ore. — A body was found during an organized search of the Meacham Ore. area on Saturday afternoon. The body was found during a search for 56-year-old Deborah Hendrichs a Star woman who has been missing since January.

Umatilla County Search and Rescue and Oregon State Police coordinated a multi-agency search of the Meacham area in hopes of locating Hendrichs. The search was set to continue through Sunday but concluded at 1 p.m. Saturday after searchers notified Incident Command that a body was found on the east side of I-84 near milepost 238 south of Meacham.

56-year-old Hendrichs went missing just after 5 p.m. on Jan. 11 after running out of gas on Interstate 84 near Meacham which is about two hours northwest of Ontario.

From art museums to zoos there’s something for everybody.

And then there’s the lake. Lake Michigan is not only the third largest of the Great Lakes when measured by water surface it’s also the only Great Lake located entirely in the United States. So what’s that mean to Chicago? This: The City of Chicago has 22 miles of shoreline on Lake Michigan.

Of course you can go to public beaches and even walk bike run or rollerblade along the 18-mile Lakefront Trail — with its spectacular views of Lake Michigan and the Chicago skyline. But to really appreciate Lake Michigan you need to get out on the water. That way you can simply hang out with family and friends. On the other hand you can also cruise along the coast and look at icons of Chicago’s skyline including the John Hancock Center Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) Adler Planetarium McCormick Place as well as Navy Pier and Buckingham Fountain.

There’s just one problem — you need a boat. And actually when it comes to boats there are a number of problems.

You don’t need to own a boat — or have been a boat owner — to be familiar with the expression “The two happiest days in a boat owner’s life are the day you buy a boat and the day you sell the boat.” That’s because in addition to the initial cost of the boat it’s expensive and time-consuming to maintain them. Plus when the boat eventually needs repair — and that day always comes sooner than expected — the estimate for repairs can be shocking!

Secondly whether you live in Chicago or the suburbs or have simply visited you know how difficult it can be to find a parking space for your car. Finding mooring for your boat isn’t quite as bad but it can be challenging. While the Chicago Park District operates 10 harbors that doesn’t necessarily mean you can get a mooring slip in the harbor you like best. Plus since harbor season runs May 1 to October 31 you’ll also need to find dry storage for your boat — and pay all those associated fees as well!

That’s all fine if you know — or at least think — you’ll be on the lake often. Personally I realized a long time ago that if I wasn’t on the water most weekends having a boat just didn’t seem worthwhile. That’s why I like the GetMyBoat boat rental and water experience market: It makes finding a boat to rent or charter easy and quick. From finding a boat you can take out on Lake Michigan for a few hours yourself to chartering a captained boat large enough for a family reunion GetMyBoat makes finding the right boat and booking it easy.

Here are a number of activities GetMyBoat can help you make special for your family and friends.

Sail Lake Michigan

Boating on Lake Michigan doesn’t have to mean a boat with a motor. In fact Lake Michigan is one of the best places in the world for sailing. If you are an accomplished sailor there are vessels you can rent so you and your family or friends can have a fantastic day sailing on Lake Michigan. Here are two examples:

Try Your Hand At Sailing

Want to spend some time sailing — and maybe even give it a try yourself? This option gives you the best of both worlds. You can sit back relax and look at Chicago’s skyline as the captain and crew do all the work. Then if you also want to learn how to sail a certified instructor will let you take a more active role. Here is one example:

Let The Captain Do The Sailing

Let’s face it: Lake Michigan can be choppy and sailboats are large so experience is critical. If you want to spend time on a 36-foot yacht sailing around the lake while you relax and let an experienced captain helm the vessel there are a number of options to make your day on the water something to remember. Here are two examples:

Feel The Need For Speed (Boats)

If sailing or yachting just doesn’t work for you or you need something really different you need to check out a speed boat. Perfect for smaller groups these captained speed boats are built to keep you safe while sightseeing at high speeds — even while taking tight turns. Here are two examples:

Party On The Water

Pontoon Party

If you’ve never been on a pontoon boat you have missed an experience! Pontoon boats have a large flat deck which allows them to have expansive lounge areas stand-up bars and plenty of room for walking around. On a pontoon boat you can even cruise the Chicago River. In other words it’s a party boat! Here are two examples:

Tiki-Bar On The Water

Have a large group and want to try something really different? You need to charter an island-themed boat with a tiki bar and tables and a large uncovered deck for sightseeing and enjoying the weather. In addition to a captain and crew these boats also have a bartender! Here are two examples:

Celebrate In Style On A Yacht

Captain-Not-Included Yachts

If you want to spend some time on a yacht and are a U.S. Coast Guard-licensed captain or know a captain this can be the perfect yachting option for you and your guests. These yachts are perfect for up to 12 people making them ideal for a birthday anniversary or graduation party. Oh and if you aren’t a licensed captain yourself don’t worry. The owners can provide you with a list of qualified captains you can hire. Here are two examples:

Luxury Yacht

There are yachts and then there are luxury yachts. If you need a yacht that makes a lasting impression for a memorable event like your anniversary retirement party or a small private wedding this type of yacht will fit the bill. And to make an event even more memorable consider a sunset cruise. Here are two examples:

Charter A Party Yacht

You probably aren’t planning on entertaining a really large group right now but Chicago and the State of Illinois are both relaxing COVID-19 restrictions and the day will soon come when you can host large parties again. When that day arrives you need to think about chartering a large luxury yacht. That way you’ll be able to entertain 20 to 45 guests. This type of charter is perfect for celebrating everything from birthday and anniversary parties to family reunions and wedding parties. Here are two examples:

Ride A SeaDoo

If you have the need for speed and want to absolutely rip around Lake Michigan for a while enjoying the weather seeing Chicago’s skyline and hanging out with a friend or loved one there’s only one thing to do. You need to rent a SeaDoo for a few hours or even all day. Here’s an example:

Pro Tips

When a captain is not included in the boat rental you’ll either need to hire a captain yourself or hire a captain from a list provided by the boat owner. Either way make sure the captain has the appropriate license.

If you choose a bare-boat rental you’ll need to pay the captain as well. In some cases there also may be fuel reimbursement and boat cleaning fees in addition to the cost of boat rental. Be sure to determine what all the fees will be in advance to prevent surprises later.

Gold!! The glittering metal that dream and fortunes are made of. Wyoming three major gold strikes from 1850 until 1895. South Pass City Centennial and Bald Mountain in the 1890s. Bald Mountain is 60 miles from Sheridan not far from Medicine Mountain and Bear Lodge.

On April 26 1891 the Wyoming Commonwealth the Special Organ of the State Board of Mines from Cheyenne had an interview with Thomas T. Howd of Sheridan who had much experience in mining and prospecting about the recent Bald Mountain discoveries when asked are the prospects as good as reported Howd replied “I consider them very good indeed we are not however trying to get up a boom. That will come soon enough. I understand that from 75 to 100 miners are already preparing to leave the Black Hills camps for Bald mountain.”

Hard steep hills are encountered and must be climbed. The necessary equipment for such a trip are (food a strong conveyance winter clothes and bedding. The weather so far this season has been quite cold and unsettled.”

Half Ounce Creek where gold was found

Typical weather in the Bighorn Mountains in the spring in unpredictable. In the ten days the 1891 reporter said that it rained snowed or hailed every 24 hours and sometimes we had all sorts of weather except warm weather within an hour’s time. He said he found more gold around Bald mountain than he had expected. The gold was of superior quality and at the time was worth about $18.20 per ounce. Considerable gold was found in numerous gulches in the head of the Little Horn River and creeks that form the headwaters of the Tongue River.

Bald Mountain across the highway from Bald Mt. City

One day the writer reported that he ‘sluiced and cleaned up $31.50 worth of gold.” In 1890 the purchasing power of $31 is equivalent to $900 today so that was a pretty fair amount of money for a day’s work.

Sheridan Enterprise May 28 1892 stated that H.H. Hawkins general manager of the Fortunatus Mining Co was in Sheridan from NY and he said his company will have machinery in Bald Mountain to save the gold as soon as the weather will permit transportation. In the same paper one small article said “the tide to Bald Mountain with pack horses has already set in.”

In 1892 The Fortunatas Mining Company purchased a group of claims on the head of the Little Horn River and Porcupine Creek. The excitement led to the establishment of Bald Mountain City the most extensive attempt at a settlement in the Big Horn Mountains. At one time there were as many as 50 buildings including a saloon meat market an “eating house” a hotel blacksmith shop general store and drug store.

In 1895 with talk of a rich vein being discovered mining machinery was hauled up the steep slopes by ox team from Dayton. Fortunatus poured in about a half million dollars into the effort and in late 1896 Fred D. Smith mining engineer at the University of Montana exposed the claims as being exaggerated. Although some mining continued near Bald Mountain City as late as 1903 the gold was not commercially viable.

There was one article in The Sheridan Daily Journal June 10 1896 which stated that there was little or no sickness at Bald Mountain City. Due to this the article said Bald Mountain City may one day be known as health resort as well as rich mining camp.

Informational sign along Highway 14 A about Bald Mountain City

At that time the paper reported that new business include a blacksmith shop a market with a stamp mills to be installed here later in the summer with more businesses expected. The Fortunatus outfit is expected in every day when work will be resumed on large scale.

“The season here is unusually far advanced the snow having disappeared except from the gulches and north side of the mountain. Flowers are abundant and grass beautiful. Stock on the range is looking well. The camp is unusually well supplied with surveyors and engineers. Several prospectors from Colorado and Idaho came to the gold fields at Bald Mountain.”

The article says about the miners “They are satisfied with the prospects and Bald mountain will this summer. No difficulty is experienced now in getting to camp even with heavy loads. Our post offlce Is still in statue quo.” It said that one group of investors had about perfected arrangements to put in saw mill. “A plant of that kind is needed very much and will do considerable toward building up the camp. Almost everyone here will have to have more or less lumber with very poor prospects of getting it until mill established here.”

The Bald Mountain gold rush lasted for about 6 years from the first gold strike in 1891 into 1903. However the gold proved to be too small and fine for an extensive mining operation and the miners moved on to richer veins.

Today not much is left of Bald Mountain City Foundations are gone but clumps of trees where cabins were are still growing. There are some ruins near Half-Ounce Meadows along Half Ounce Creek where a great deal of panning went on. The logs appeared to be ‘hand hewed” and of the era of the late 1800’s and it could have started out as a miner’s cabin during the time of the gold rush. Perhaps the owner panned for gold during the day a dreamed golden dreams during the night.

Another ruin is about five miles away on a high rocky windy ridge that also was constructed of hand hewed very large logs. Seeing that the elevation of the area is around 9000 feet with deep snow in the winter cold winds and chill temperatures it is little wonder that the settlement didn’t survive.

No. 118 (April 30 2021) the Board dismissed a complaint alleging that an employer’s bargaining proposals seeking significant concessions violated the duty to bargain in good faith. Notably the Board found that even when faced with extreme proposals a union must still “test” the employer’s willingness to make concessions and must itself contribute to bargaining by offering counterproposals.

Factual Background

In anticipation of the expiration of their prior CBA in December 2016 an employer and a union began negotiations over a successor agreement. The employer warned that it sought to rectify “numerous deficiencies” in the prior agreement and alter many of its provisions. The employer opened negotiations with a set of four employer-friendly proposals: (1) its Grievance and Mediation proposal along with its No Strikes No Lockouts and Management Rights proposals; (2) its Discipline proposal making disputes over discharges no longer subject to binding arbitration; (3) its Union Security proposal removing the union security provision in the parties’ expired CBA; and (4) its Wage proposal which gave it substantial discretion over pay.

During the course of negotiation the union’s counsel was fond of using profanity and colorful language to demonstrate his contempt for the employer’s positions. He labeled one proposal as “a nothing burger” and called another “an absolute waste of everyone’s time.” He told the employer’s representatives to “kiss my a–” and to “get the f— out of here.” The union counsel responded to employer proposals with one-word denials such as “reject” or “no” and often failed to offer written counterproposals. In contrast the employer made significant concessions in response to ongoing discussions such as by lessening the length of time disciplinary actions would remain in employees’ files or offering to work with the union to place employees within its proposed pay ranges. At one session the employer noted that the union had failed to counter 15 of its proposals while the employer had responded to all but two from the union.

More than 18 months after the employer presented its initial proposals the union made counterproposals containing significant revisions to what had already been agreed upon by the parties. Nonetheless the employer discussed the counterproposals and continued to express its willingness to negotiate. In October 2018 the employer received a petition signed by a majority of employees in the bargaining unit which it considered clear and unequivocal proof that the union had lost the support of a majority of unit employees. The employer withdrew recognition from the union and began to unilaterally implement its proposals.

The union filed unfair labor practice charges. An Administrative Law Judge determined that the employer engaged in bad faith bargaining in violation of Section 8(a)(5). The employer appealed to the Board.

Analysis

A Board majority (Members Ring and Emanuel) reversed the ALJ and dismissed the complaint. The Board began its discussion by observing that while Section 8(d) of the NLRA requires parties to negotiate in good faith this obligation “does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession.” Thus the Board must ultimately determine under the totality of the circumstances whether “the employer is engaging in hard but lawful bargaining” or is instead “unlawfully endeavoring to frustrate the possibility of arriving at any agreement.”

Where it is alleged that an employer violated its duty to bargain in good faith on the basis of its bargaining proposals the Board will not evaluate whether specific proposals are “acceptable” or “unacceptable” but must consider whether the employer seeks to “frustrate agreement” on the basis of objective factors. More significantly the Board will not find an employer failed to bargain in good faith “if the union assumes that the employer’s initial proposals reflect unalterable positions without testing the employer’s willingness to engage in the give and take of collective bargaining.”

The Board pointed out that the employer had informed the union that one of the disputed issues a union security clause was ultimately included in a CBA with another union after a “back and forth” process.

The Board emphasized that the employer did not insist on its proposals as all-or-nothing. Instead the employer “advanced its proposals as entry points for discussions repeatedly invited the Union to offer counterproposals never refused to entertain counters on the rare occasions the Union offered them and ultimately withdrew its no-strike proposal” as well as other concessions. The Board found that under these facts the employer did not seek to frustrate any possible agreement.

The Board noted that the employer did not violate its duty to bargain by seeking significant concessions in its initial proposals and observed that it had “substantial leverage” because a long time had passed since the employees had received raises. The Board found that the employer was not required to bargain against itself in response to the union’s absent counterproposals and that it was not bad-faith bargaining to present a “wish list” or “kitchen sink” proposal in its initial position. As a result the Board reversed the lower court and dismissed the union’s complaint holding that due to the above considerations as well as the lack of any evidence of improper conduct away from the bargaining table the employer did not engage in bad faith bargaining.

In her dissent Chairman McFerran noted there was no disagreement over the basic legal principles but that “[w]e differ and differ sharply on how to apply the law to the facts presented.” Specifically the Chairman noted that the Board recently ruled that the employer’s conduct in a similar case discussed here violated the Act and that “an employer can make a mockery of the duty to bargain by adhering to proposals which clearly demonstrate an intent not to reach an agreement” with a union.

Takeaways

This case demonstrates how the conduct of the parties can greatly impact a determination of whether the bargaining constituted bad faith. The majority here noted that the employer made some hard bargaining proposals which might seem distasteful on first blush. The fact that the union failed to respond materially other than to reject the proposals without making a counter-proposal left the employer with a difficult choice: modify its own proposal or simply hold onto the proposal until a meaningful response was received. However employers should note that while it is permissible to take an “extreme” position initially employers must still engage in meaningful discussions and seriously consider a union’s counterproposals during subsequent bargaining. The outcome of the “give and take” between employer and union ultimately rests on the strength of the parties’ positions. This is a case that undoubtedly would be decided differently under a different Board. At least for now an employer does not violate its duty to bargain by sticking to its guns so long as its actions remain reasonable.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15am95b25saW5lLmNvbS91bml2ZXJzYWwtaG9zcGl0YWxzLWdyb3VwLWRvbmF0ZXMtbWVkaWNhbC1jb25zdW1hYmxlcy10by0yLWhlYWx0aC1mYWNpbGl0aWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Universal Hospitals Group donates medical consumables to 2 health facilities,"The Universal Hospitals Group (UHG) has donated medical consumables to two hospital facilities at separate ceremonies on their premises in the Greater Accra Region.

First Malaysia’s frontliners have a world-class commitment to this fight. Second under-resourcing of healthcare has been exposed to public scrutiny and concern. Third the relationship between the public and private sectors has fallen short of expectations and the leaders have resorted to public bickering in the midst of a global health crisis.

Malaysia needs and deserves a world-class universal health system which should provide comprehensive high-quality treatment free of charge at the point of need to everyone who needs it when they need it.

Currently the funding management and governance of healthcare in Malaysia is not fit-for-purpose in delivering this aim.

Many people are not aware that almost half of Malaysia’s health spending comes from private sources.

Out-of-pocket expenses account for around 38 per cent of spending according to Ministry of Health data but private insurance accounts for only seven per cent and charities and private companies add another four per cent.

This heavy reliance on private out-of-pocket spending is problematic from an economic perspective. Contrary to popular opinion healthcare is not a public good because people can be denied access because of costs and the constraints on resources.

Economists say it is excludable and rival in consumption which is the exact opposite of a public good.

Healthcare is formally a “merit good” or a private product provided through public means because it is beneficial and would be under-provided by the market if the private sector was left to its own devices.

Healthcare is also subject to multiple cases where the market fails to provide adequate or equitable coverage for people who need treatment.

Private insurance for example excludes people with costly long-term chronic illness or prior conditions. This in itself justifies public healthcare.

Other important causes of market failure in the private healthcare system include the problem of uninformed consumers. Patients are not able to judge whether the treatment recommended is necessary or of the right type or is being charged at the right price so they can’t make a proper decision as to whether they should buy it or not.

This also leads to a form of “moral hazard” where unscrupulous private hospitals can take advantage of patients. Unnecessary treatments or tests are recommended because doctors and hospitals earn money from them and the “doctor knows best” imbalance puts vulnerable patients at a disadvantage.

Private health providers push curative rather than preventative healthcare because they don’t get paid so much if they prevent you from getting sick.

They under-provide unprofitable healthcare such as physiotherapy and particularly long-term residential care which accounts for less than 0.1 per cent of private spending.

Overcharging is endemic because patients do not know the true price of treatment or whether it is necessary. Brand name medicines are overused because they have a bigger profit margin to generic medicines.

Private hospitals deny overcharging but during this pandemic a private hospital in Kuala Lumpur was fined RM200000 for an offence under Section 11 of the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011 when it charged RM11.20 for face masks which should cost only RM1.50.

Part of this failure arises because of the management culture mostly run by clinicians without management qualifications. We would not expect an accountant to perform a successful tonsillectomy so why would we expect an ENT specialist to be a good financial manager?

Systemic management dysfunction is common including “accidental managers” where medical specialists become managers only for career progression. “Group think” causes resistance to innovation and growth. Key functions and intuitions can be captured by special interest groups.

A lack of diversity across age gender specialism and aptitude can lead to “grumpy old men” syndrome that excludes important stakeholders such as women practitioners.

Most importantly patients the largest and most important group of stakeholders are actively excluded from healthcare management. If this happened in another industry we would be shocked.

Poor management and leadership exacerbates the problems of market failure and leads to rigid unresponsive management and poor resource decisions which damage patient confidence in the long-term.

These ideas are well understood by economists especially with the social market economy framework which provides solutions based on good governance of private markets.

The principle of liability within the social market ensures that there is a balance between buyers and sellers and the principle of public provision of merit goods and the principle of solidarity ensures that no-one is excluded due to market or management failures.

In terms of governance many recent cases in the public domain show how dangerous the private healthcare market can be for patients.

Most recently a Penang lawyer is suing three hospitals eight doctors over wrong cancer diagnosis.

A Federal Court decision of September 2017 means that private hospitals are not generally liable for negligence by the independent medical practitioners who practice there. The lawyers who won this case for a hospital celebrate the decision and the RM100000 in legal cost awarded in their favour but for patients the effects of this decision are chilling.

First it denies them any general claim against hospitals for negligence and malpractice by the doctors they recommend and credentialise. Second it encourages a moral hazard in which private hospitals can reduce the monitoring of doctors because they are protected from legal liability when the doctors misbehave. Third for international medical tourists in particular it signals that patients are on their own if anything goes wrong because the private hospitals will not look after them.

The public sector is also not immune as there have been cases of female doctors being abused by male superiors as well as abuse of junior housemen.

There appears to be a systemic governance problem in the medical profession which harms the customers of medical services and exacerbates market failure.

Cover-ups by the Malaysian medical fraternity have also been reported.

Even a former President of the Malaysian Medical Council (MMC) has publicly called-out mismanagement and conflicts of interest in the governing body of the Malaysian medical profession.

Given this background the need for a national discussion on the economics management and governance in Malaysian healthcare has never been more urgent.

Above all the statutory civil law and regulatory protection of patients as customers in the private healthcare market denudes them of feasible remedies at law.

This is made worse by the governance system within the MMC particularly the private sector members which protects doctors at the expense of patient welfare as a matter of standard practice so that the private system is not properly regulated within a social market framework.

MARYSOL FRAGOSO

Se cumple medio siglo desde que el matador mexicano Eloy Cavazos debutó en Madrid España. Ante un panorama cuesta arriba logró triunfar cortó una oreja de cada toro y salió por la Puerta Grande en hombros de cientos de aficionados: “Fui a presentarme a Madrid sin un peso en la bolsa y por eso no pude prepararme bien; apenas logré torear en dos corridas era 1971: Málaga (11 de abril) y Barcelona (9 de mayo) y de ahí derechito a Las Ventas” recordó el maestro regiomontano en una entrevista exclusiva para ESTO: “Nadie daba un veinte por mí y mira salí por la Puerta Grande lo malo fue que tres días después ahí mismo un toro me partió el pecho y por eso mi temporada sólo tuvo treinta corridas y no todas las que podría haber toreado de no haber caído herido tan gravemente”.

El diestro siguió abundando: “Tenía apenas 20 años e iba con una gran ilusión porque sabía que si salía por la Puerta Grande de Las Ventas sería como pegarle ‘al gordo’ de la lotería. ¡Y le pegue! Mis dos toros se prestaron para el lucimiento y los maté de estocada. Corté la oreja de cada uno y salí por la Puerta Grande que es una de las sensaciones más hermosas que puedan existir” dijo al término del Festival de Leyendas que toreó en la plaza Cinco Villas del Estado de México donde hace unas semanas volvió a torear frente al público para cortar una oreja ahora que se acerca a cumplir 72 años de edad.

La fecha del 20 de mayo de 1971 la tiene tan presente y la relata como si hubiera sido ayer cuando cortó una oreja a cada toro de la dehesa de José Luis Osborne por lo que salió en volandas por vez primera en la capital hispana. Ese día todo era felicidad sin embargo este torero regio venía de remontar en México una etapa amarga.

Para el exterior Cavazos traía una gran racha pues en febrero de 1970 había cortado un rabo en la Monumental Plaza México; el primero de los ocho que obtuvo lo que le dio un número importante de festejos por torear en los cosos de los estados. Hilvanaba triunfo tras triunfo sin embargo sobre sus hombros traía una gran pena.

“El primer rabo que corté en La México fue el más importante para mí porque venía de sufrir un accidente. Fue por Zacatacas en mi coche. Cuando nos accidentamos yo me salvé porque iba acostado en el asiento de atrás pero perdieron la vida el matador Jaime Bravo ¡qué tanto me apoyó¡ y el novillero Manuel Silva ‘El Cade’. A los seis días tuve que torear en la capital y corté ese rabo. Esa tarde alterné con Manolo Martínez y José Fuentes. Esa faena además me abrió la oportunidad de ir a Madrid a confirmar el doctorado” seguía recordando el maestro mientras se dirigía al vestidor para cambiar el traje corto por el de civil

“Aún recuerdo el terno con el que debuté en Madrid. Fue azul turquesa y oro. Recuerdo a mi apoderado: don Rafael Báez diciéndome: ‘Te ruego Eloy que por tu bien y por el bien del toreo mexicano que salga como salga la cosa cuando estés en el ruedo te la juegues y te pegues un arrimón’. Y así lo hice porque mi padrino de alternativa: Miguel Mateo “Miguelin” tenía un poderío tremendo; y el testigo: Gabriel De la Casa era un torero inmenso”. Cabe destacar que fueron seis las orejas que cortó Eloy Cavazos durante las ocho tardes en que toreó en la plaza de toros Las Ventas de la capital española.

Eloy Cavazos Ramírez concluyó con la siguiente reflexión: “Agradezco a Dios que me permite seguir disfrutando en el toreo porque en los tiempos que estamos viviendo de repente se te aparece ‘La Flaca’ y acaba con todo. Agradezco poder seguir haciendo faenas y pegando muletazos al lado de toreros viejitos como yo y de los jóvenes que aún tiene la ambición de convertirse en toreros”.

Una vida ejemplar

Eloy Cavazos Ramírez nació en una cuna modesta en el pueblo de Villa de Guadalupe en Nuevo León. Era un caserío adjunto a la ciudad de Monterrey. Su padre don Héctor Cavazos era cuidador de la placita de toros: “No nací envuelto en pañales de seda un 25 de agosto de 1950. Soy el quinto de los nueve hermanos Cavazos-Ramírez. Teníamos una casa hecha con paredes de barro y techo de lámina. Estaba al lado de la caballeriza y de los corrales de la plaza de toros. Dormíamos sobre petos de caballos y mantas para mulillas. El ambiente de la placita hizo que naciera mi afición. Más adelante un novillero conocido como ‘El Pony»’ me regaló para Navidad un capotito que sirvió para que ganara mis primeros pesos como torero”.

Pasó poco tiempo para que fuera invitado a la ganadería de Cuco Peña en Laredo. Para ese momento ya toreaba con una cuadrilla de niños toreros con la que llegó a participar en más de 70 festejos.

La llegada de don Rafael Báez y su esposa Betty a la vida de Eloy fue determinante pues fue a vivir con ellos. Toreó su primera novillada formal el 25 de abril de 1965 en Guadalajara Jalisco. Fueron 47 novilladas antes de presentarse en la Monumental de México donde debutó el 12 de junio de 1966. ante ejemplares de la ganadería michoacana de Santa Martha. El novillo del debut se llamó Trovador. Completaron el cartel aquella memorable tarde los también novilleros Leonardo Manza y Gonzalo Iturbe. Eloy cortó dos orejas.

Cabe recordar que la señora Betty empeñó todas sus joyas para que Eloy tuviera un vestido digno para torear en La México donde hasta 1968 confirmó la alternativa que había obtenido Monterrey en 1966 con Antonio Velásquez y Manolo Martínez y toros de San Miguel de Mimiahuapan. La confirmación fue con Alfredo Leal y Jaime Rangel ante toros de Jesús Cabrera. Eloy cortó tres orejas y ganó el trofeo Azteca de Oro como triunfador de la temporada.

A consecuencia de una enfermedad Cavazos dijo adiós de los ruedos en 1985. Regresó a los ruedos en 1987 y volvió a remontar hasta convertirse en líder del escalafón. El 1 de junio de 1991 cortó su última oreja en la Monumental Las Ventas de Madrid a un burel de Los Bayones. En 2002 (3 de mayo) toreó por última vez en Madrid pero no cortó apéndices. Fue hasta 2008 que dijo adiós de manera definitiva a los ruedos en la Monumental de Monterrey.

Ahora comienza a surgir de nuevo la esperanza con el repunte en las ventas aunque no como se requiere pues a pesar de la proximidad del 10 de mayo los pasillos de este centro de consumo permanecen la mayor parte del día semivacíos.

Recordó cómo el año anterior en pleno inicio de la contingencia sanitaria simplemente no hubo ventas “nos la pasamos en casa guardados” dijo y explicó que consecuentemente su negocio que había subsistido exitosamente durante los últimos 35 años se cayó pensó incluso en desistir y cerrar. Sin embargo recurrió a su hermano que vive en los Estados Unidos para solicitar un préstamo y con este reiniciar labores en la florería Julieta.

Y es que señaló con gesto amargo “aunque en su momento nos provocó esperanza el anuncio de los gobiernos en el sentido de que nos otorgarían apoyos préstamos para salir adelante estos jamás llegaron lamentablemente”.

A pregunta expresa señaló que en efecto a partir del 14 de febrero pasado el negocio de las flores registra un alza importante en su actividad y desde entonces se ha mantenido aunque no con la intensidad que se requiere “si usted se fija los pasillos están casi vacíos cuando en años anteriores para estas fechas la gente ya estaba comprando sus flores. Hoy no es así esperamos que el sábado el domingo y el lunes mejore la situación”.

Lo hacen apenas unos días después de dar por cerrada (el pasado 31 de marzo) la campaña de 2020-2021 complicada en lo agronómico y especialmente en lo comercial.

A simple vista las cifras no evidencian las dificultades a las que han tenido que hacer frente los agricultores y los industriales. La superficie cultivada ha aumentado. Lo ha hecho especialmente en Castilla y León Castilla-La Mancha y Aragón. Ha aumentado también la producción. Y se ha mantenido el volumen de ventas tanto en el mercado interior como fuera de las fronteras españolas hacia donde se dirige el 80% de la producción de alfalfa deshidratada con la que se alimentan las ganaderías de todo el mundo especialmente aquellas que se sitúan en los lejanos países asiáticos.

Como cada año la campaña del pasado año se iniciaba en el mes de abril. Pero entonces las circunstancias del país eran completamente desconocidas. Aragón como el resto del país daba los primeros pasos inmerso en un escenario de pandemia mundial provocada por un desconocido virus detectado por primera vez en la ciudad china de Wuhan que obligó a confinar totalmente a la población en sus casas durante tres meses para evitar la propagación de un nuevo coronavirus conocido ya con el nombre de Sars-Cov-2 y que provocaba una enfermedad letal ya tristemente popular con la denominación de covid.

No es que la crisis sanitaria impidiera realizar la recolección tal como se hace habitualmente más allá de las medidas de protección y seguridad impuestas para evitar los contagios. Porque la actividad agraria era esencial y como tal los agricultores (entre ellos los productores de alfalfa) eran de los pocos trabajadores que continuaban realizando sus labores para garantizar el suministro de la alimentación en este caso a las ganaderías y asegurar así el suministro de carne a los consumidores.

Pero el golpe de la pandemia no pasó de largo para estas producciones. Sus repercusiones se dejaron sentir en la comercialización de este forraje que una vez deshidratado en formato de balas o peles viaja hacia mercados de todo el mundo.

Todo iba bien en los primeros meses de campaña hasta que llegó el mes de julio. Explican los expertos que los meses de encierro mundial obligado por la pandemia la reducción de un importante número de trabajadores en los puertos que entorpecieron sobremanera las operaciones logísticas el cierre de agencias dedicadas a esta actividad y un menor número de barcos en circulación debido a las restricciones de movimientos provocaron un estancamiento de contenedores desconocido hasta ahora y que todavía no se ha conseguido solucionar en su totalidad. Y ante una demanda que no rebajaba el tono se dispararon los precios de los fletes.

Para una producción como la alfalfa deshidratada dependiente de la exportación y que utiliza el barco como principal medio de transporte para llegar a sus clientes el escenario no podía ser peor. Sus costes se han disparado y han sido las industrias las que han tenido que asumir dicho gasto reduciendo así los márgenes para no perder mercados.

Una preocupación que lejos de alejarse continúa en el horizonte de esta nueva campaña.

Las cifras globales con las que los productores de alfalfa han cerrado la campaña (abril de 2020-marzo de 2021) no reflejan las complicaciones que han tenido que sortear agricultores e industriales para mantener su producción y sus mercados.

La superficie de cultivo contratada y destinada a la alfalfa creció en cerca de 8.000 hectáreas lo que supone un incremento del 7% respecto a la campaña anterior. La producción también aumentó. Los datos de la Asociación Española de Fabricantes de Alfalfa Deshidratada (AEFA) con sede en Zaragoza evidencian que durante la pasada campaña la producción de forrajes deshidratados sumó 1.465.043 toneladas 53.621 toneladas más o lo que es lo mismo un aumento del 38% respecto a la campaña anterior. Fueron las comunidades de Castilla y León Castilla-La Mancha Aragón y Extremadura que registraron incrementos del 13% 118% 6% y 14% respectivamente las que impulsaron la producción y contrarrestaron los descensos experimentados en Andalucía donde la producción fue un 20% menor seguido de Navarra y Cataluña donde el descenso se sitúo en el 2%.

Las cifras no tienen tanto que ver con el aumento de la superficie como con las condiciones climáticas. ""Hay que tener en cuenta que las alfalfas de primer año no producen especialmente bien"" señala el director de AEFA Luis Machín que explica que fueron las abundantes lluvias primaverales las que dieron vida especialmente a los secanos de Castilla y León.

No parecía sin embargo al comienzo de la campaña que se pudieran conseguir estas cifras. Los primeros cortes se realizaron en pleno confinamiento. Pero no fue la dura medida sanitaria la que complicó la faena en un sector considerado esencial. Fueron las lluvias las que regaron de incertidumbre los cultivos especialmente en Aragón que produce cerca del 66% del total del país. Tantas precipitaciones complicaron el trabajo en el campo ""porque este es un cultivo al que no le gustan las interrupciones y necesita continuidad en cada corte"" matiza Machín. Y lo que es peor la constante humedad provocó demasiadas enfermedades y plagas que afectaron a la calidad de las dos primeras recolecciones.

""Todo cambió con el tercer cuarto y quinto corte"" señala el director de esta Asociación. El clima se tornó benévolo y no solo se consiguió una alta producción sino que además la calidad también fue buena ""paliando en buena medida los problemas del cultivo en primavera"" puntualiza.

Si la producción se mantuvo incluso creció ligeramente también lo hicieron las ventas. De los más de 146 millones de toneladas producidas de las que 816.000 proceden de Aragón un total de 1.170.000 toneladas han tenido como destino los mercados internacionales mientras que algo más de 300.000 han sido consumidas por las ganaderías españolas. ""Las cifras son muy similares a las de las últimas campañas"" explica Machín que detalla que así como la producción fue ""de menos a más"" la comercialización hizo el viaje a la inversa ""de más a menos"".

""Las retribuciones por el producto transformado en los primeros meses de campaña fueron interesantes pero desgraciadamente desde el mes de julio y especialmente durante los últimos meses del atípico 2020 nuestro sector especialmente dependiente de las exportaciones comenzó a sufrir la falta de los contenedores y el incremento de los fletes es decir los problemas en el transporte marítimo derivados de la pandemia"" destaca Machín.

Toda la exportación afectada

No ha habido mercado exterior que no se haya visto afectado por los problemas para encontrar contenedores para disponer de espacio de carga en los buques y para hacer frente a unos fletes disparados. Una complicación a la que insiste Machín las empresas han tenido que hacer frente con mucho esfuerzo e incluso asumiendo el incremento de los costes que suponía la exportación.

La falta de contenedero ha complicado la campaña de ventas. AEFA

El mayor impacto del difícil escenario pandémico lo sufrieron las ventas a China. Los datos (todavía provisionales ya que falta cerrar las cifras del último mes) dan buena cuenta de la situación. ""Seguramente acabaremos la campaña con un descenso del 50% del volumen exportado respecto al año anterior"" señala el director de AEFA. Pero no todo es achacable a los problemas de logística. En este descenso también han tenido mucho que ver explica el acuerdo alcanzado entre China y Estados Unidos que comprometía al país asiático a realizar millonarias compras de productos agrarios; la fortaleza del euro frente al dólar que ha hecho menos competitivas las exportaciones europeas; así como la imposibilidad de viajar (para promocionar producto y contactar con nuevos clientes) debido a las restricciones sanitarias.

Mejor suerte se ha corrido en los Emiratos Árabes Unidos hacia donde se dirigen cerca del 45% de total de las ventas internacionales de alfalfa deshidratada española. ""Los mercados árabes han funcionado bien"" señala Machín que destaca el crecimiento de la demanda en Arabia Saudí sobre todo en pelets ""probablemente porque este formato puede ir cargado en bodega y eso ha permitido que tuvieran mejor salida"" matiza.

Destacada ha sido asimismo la evolución de las ventas en Corea del Sur. ""Hasta ahora y a falta de cerrar las cifras del mes de marzo han viajado hacia ese país algo más de 50.000 toneladas"". El dato es significativo si se tiene en cuenta no solo que casi duplica lo exportado en la campaña anterior (unas 25.000 toneladas) sino que demuestra un crecimiento espectacular respecto a las 10.000 toneladas que se comercializaban en ese mercado en 2015.

""Japón se ha convertido también en un mercado muy apetecible porque es un gran demandante de alfalfa"" explica Machín que adelanta que se está trabajando en una misión comercial virtual (como mandan los tiempos de pandemia) para promocionar las cualidades y calidades del forraje deshidratado español.

Los productores españoles no solo miran hacia Asia. Mantienen sus exportaciones en Europa y no pierden de vista el otro lado del mundo. Han crecido las exportaciones de pelets en Sudamérica con lo que se abren las posibilidades de avanzar por este mercado especialmente en países como Colombia y Brasil.

Nueva campaña

La incertidumbre (y el coste) que la escasez de contenedores marítimos y el precio de los fletes marcó la pasada campaña no ha desaparecido en la actual que comenzó el pasado mes de abril con los primeros cortes.

""La recolección venía adelantada pero las últimas lluvias caídas a finales de abril obligaron a parar"" señala Machín que reconoce que todavía es ""muy pronto"" para estimar el volumen de producción ya que aunque se estima que la superficie ocupada por el cultivo será similar a la del pasado año ""otra cosa será la evolución del cultivo muy condicionada por el clima"".

El director de AEFA confía en cualquier caso en que lo recolectado durante esta campaña sea de calidad y mantenga las cifras del pasado año.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pZGVhbC5lcy9zb2NpZWRhZC9jcmVjZW4tbGlnZXJhbWVudGUtdmVudGFzLXBhcmFjZXRhbW9sLWVmZWN0b3Mtc2VjdW5kYXJpb3MtdmFjdW5hcy0yMDIxMDUwODE0MjkyMC1udC5odG1sP2VkdG49Z3JhbmFkYdIBemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlkZWFsLmVzL3NvY2llZGFkL2NyZWNlbi1saWdlcmFtZW50ZS12ZW50YXMtcGFyYWNldGFtb2wtZWZlY3Rvcy1zZWN1bmRhcmlvcy12YWN1bmFzLTIwMjEwNTA4MTQyOTIwLW50X2FtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vacunas contra la covid-19 | Crecen ligeramente las ventas de paracetamol por prevención de los efectos secundarios de la vacuna,"Las ventas de paracetamol han experimentado un ligero repunte asociado a la vacunación contra la covid-19. En concreto se trataría de una medida preventiva con la que los usuarios buscarían prevenir las posibles reacciones secundarias que el pinchazo pudiera ocasionarles. Varias farmacias aunque no todas han advertido este efecto en sus negocios a pesar de que los expertos no encuentran un fundamento científico que avale la ingesta de este medicamento como medida profiláctica.

Ángel Martínez propietario de la farmacia que recibe su nombre reconoce haber detectado que «alguna gente que se va a poner la vacuna se lleva paracetamol». Aunque cuantificar el incremento le resulta «complicado» estima que las ventas de este medicamento habrían experimentado un incremento de aproximadamente el 10%. Ana García de la Farmacia El Ángel en cambio asegura no haber «apreciado este repunte». Desde la Farmacia Mingorance puntualizan que solamente se han percatado del incremento en las ventas tras revisar los registros. «En lo que es marzo y abril de este año sí han subido un poco pero no es una cosa exagerada. Unas 50 cajas al mes pero siempre con prescripción médica» abundan.

No obstante en esta última farmacia también asocian este fenómeno a que «hay muchísima patología de resfriados que es susceptible de ser coronavirus». Además puntualizan que hablar con los clientes les ha permitido observar que «la gente anda muy cauta» en todo lo que respecta a la vacunación. «Hay más gente que con su receta de paracetamol delante nos dice que le da miedo ponerse la vacuna que no sabe si se la pondrá. Entonces le decimos que el peligro es proporcionalmente mayor con el consumo de paracetamol que se lleva que con la vacuna» indican.

En cualquier caso las tres farmacias coinciden en que «no es necesario» tomar paracetamol antes de recibir la inyección. «En ningún caso lo recomendaríamos. Luego dependiendo de los efectos secundarios de cada usuario el médico es el que debe prescribir el tratamiento» argumenta Ana García. «En principio no hay que tomar nada salvo que aparezcan síntomas» expresa Ángel Martínez en la misma línea.

Los expertos no lo aconsejan

De igual manera los expertos no recomiendan adoptar esta medida. Lo explica a este periódico el doctor Jesús Molina Cabrillana secretario de la Sociedad Española de Medicina Preventiva Salud Pública e Higiene (SEMPSPH) quien puntualiza no obstante que lo ha visto «recogido en algún protocolo». «No tiene fundamento científico. Todos los antitérmicos analgésicos y antiinflamatorios tienen su utilidad cuando aparecen síntomas. Fuera de ahí no la tienen» asevera.

«Nosotros en las consultas cuando vacunamos a los pacientes no les recomendamos que tomen paracetamol excepto si aparecen síntomas si aparece algún tipo de reacción dolor de cabeza o fiebre pero eso nunca está indicado como tratamiento profiláctico» insiste el doctor Molina Cabrillana quien sostiene que «no porque te tomes un antitérmico va a dejar de darte fiebre». «La verdad es que yo no sé de dónde ha salido no tiene ninguna base científica pero es cierto que está en un protocolo escrito» admite para expresar seguidamente su rechazo a esta medida independientemente de la vacuna que se administre.

«Que se indique para una vacuna específica -el Ministerio de Sanidad recomendó tomar una pastilla de paracetamol antes de recibir una dosis del fármaco de AtraZeneca- da a entender que produce más reacciones lo cual no es cierto» sentencia el secretario de la SEMPSPH quien subraya que «la reactogenicidad la aparición de efectos adversos va a depender mucho del receptor». Además advierte de que la extensión de esta medida «va a hacer que se dispare el gasto farmacéutico en medicamentos que por otra parte no están haciendo nada». «No lo recomendamos. Desde el punto de vista científico no tiene ninguna indicación» apostilla."

One of the most popular changes is to ditch your old mobile carrier in favor of something new. If you’re over Verizon and its steep prices fear not. There are plenty of other carriers to consider and it’s pretty easy to make the change. Here’s everything you need to know on how to cancel Verizon’s service.

We’ll run through all of the primary services — wireless coverage Verizon’s Fios Internet and even Fios TV. The broad strokes are generally the same so we should have you liberated from Big Red in no time. Ready to make the switch?

How to cancel Verizon wireless service

Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority

Wireless service is Verizon’s bread and butter; it’s the largest US provider after all. That also means that you’re most likely here to find a way out of Big Red’s network. The process itself isn’t complicated but you’ll have to be ready to spend some time on the phone. Verizon will do just about anything it can to convince you to stay — service agents will offer special discounts fancy perks and more. However all you have to do is follow these simple steps: Call Verizon customer service at 1-844-837-2262.

Make sure to have all of your account information handy.

Inform the agent that you plan to cancel (or port) your service. That’s it. There are just three simple steps to follow but that doesn’t mean Verizon’s agents will make the phone call easy. It may help to have a solid excuse ready when they try to convince you to stick around.

If you’re not ready to leave Verizon entirely and you want to ditch a single line the process is far more manageable. Log into your My Verizon account and open your menu of devices. Find the line you want to remove and scroll through the options until you find the remove selection.

On the other hand you can always port your number away to a different carrier. This usually means that you’ll have to provide some information to your new carrier and let Verizon know your plans. You can also tap into My Verizon if you want to port your service though service agents may try to make it difficult again. If you plan to port your service make sure not to cancel your service outright as you may lose your number. Here are a few other carriers to consider:

How to cancel Fios Internet and TV service

Verizon Wireless corporate store

For better or worse Verizon links its Fios internet and TV services. On the bright side it means that you can follow a similar setup for both services. However it also means that Verizon will likely try to sell you on keeping both services instead of canceling either one. Once again be ready to stand your ground and don’t take no for an answer. Here’s what you need to know: Give Verizon Fios a call at 844-837-2262 typically within standard business hours.

Gather your account information and be ready to provide it to the agent.

Inform the service agent that you wish to cancel your service and proceed through the necessary steps. To make matters worse Fios will probably hit you with an Early Termination Fee (ETF). Fios typically locks you into two years of service which means that the ETF starts at an eye-watering $350. It will drop by $15 per month as long as you stick around so it may benefit you to wait a month or two until the fee is more manageable.

After you square things away on the phone you will most likely have to return your equipment to a local Verizon store. You typically have 30 days to take care of this so gather your cable boxes routers or modems sooner rather than later. See also: Best internet providers in the US

We are constantly streaming and buying and watching and liking our brains locked into the global information matrix as one universal and coruscating emanation of thought and emotion.

What happens when the machine stops though?

It’s a question that E.M. Forster was intensely focused on more than a century ago in a short story called rightly enough “The Machine Stops” about a human civilization connected entirely through machines that one day just turn off.

Those fears of downtime are not just science fiction anymore. Outages aren’t just missing a must-watch TikTok clip. Hospitals law enforcement the government every corporation — the entire spectrum of human institutions that constitute civilization now deeply rely on connectivity to function.

So when it comes to disaster response the world has dramatically changed. In decades past the singular focus could be roughly summarized as rescue and mitigation — save who you can while trying to limit the scale of destruction. Today though the highest priority is by necessity internet access not just for citizens but increasingly for the on-the-ground first responders who need bandwidth to protect themselves keep abreast of their mission objectives and have real-time ground truth on where dangers lurk and where help is needed.

While the sales cycles might be arduous as we learned in part one and the data trickles have finally turned to streams in part two the reality is that none of that matters if there isn’t connectivity to begin with. So in part three of this series on the future of technology and disaster response we’re going to analyze the changing nature of bandwidth and connectivity and how they intersect with emergencies taking a look at how telcos are creating resilience in their networks while defending against climate change how first responders are integrating connectivity into their operations and finally exploring how new technologies like 5G and satellite internet will affect these critical activities.

Wireless resilience as the world burns

Climate change is inducing more intense weather patterns all around the world creating second- and third-order effects for industries that rely on environmental stability for operations. Few industries have to be as dynamic to the changing context as telecom companies whose wired and wireless infrastructure is regularly buffeted by severe storms. Resiliency of these networks isn’t just needed for consumers — it’s absolutely necessary for the very responders trying to mitigate disasters and get the network back up in the first place.

Unsurprisingly no issue looms larger for telcos than access to power — no juice no bars. So all three of America’s major telcos — Verizon (which owns TechCrunch’s parent company Verizon Media although not for much longer) AT&T and T-Mobile — have had to dramatically scale up their resiliency efforts in recent years to compensate both for the demand for wireless and the growing damage wrought by weather.

Jay Naillon senior director of national technology service operations strategy at T-Mobile said that the company has made resilience a key part of its network buildout in recent years with investments in generators at cell towers that can be relied upon when the grid cannot. In “areas that have been hit by hurricanes or places that have fragile grids … that is where we have invested most of our fixed assets” he said.

Like all three telcos T-Mobile pre-deploys equipment in anticipation for disruptions. So when a hurricane begins to swirl in the Atlantic Ocean the company will strategically fly in portable generators and mobile cell towers in anticipation of potential outages. “We look at storm forecasts for the year” Naillon explained and do “lots of preventative planning.” They also work with emergency managers and “run through various drills with them and respond and collaborate effectively with them” to determine which parts of the network are most at risk for damage in an emergency. Last year the company partnered with StormGeo to accurately predict weather events.

Predictive AI for disasters is also a critical need for AT&T. Jason Porter who leads public sector and the company’s FirstNet first-responder network said that AT&T teamed up with Argonne National Laboratory to create a climate-change analysis tool to evaluate the siting of its cell towers and how they will weather the next 30 years of “floods hurricanes droughts and wildfires.” “We redesigned our buildout … based on what our algorithms told us would come” he said and the company has been elevating vulnerable cell towers four to eight feet high on “stilts” to improve their resiliency to at least some weather events. That “gave ourselves some additional buffer.”

AT&T has also had to manage the growing complexity of creating reliability with the chaos of a climate-change-induced world. In recent years “we quickly realized that many of our deployments were due to weather-related events” and the company has been “very focused on expanding our generator coverage over the past few years” Porter said. It’s also been very focused on building out its portable infrastructure. “We essentially deploy entire data centers on trucks so that we can stand up essentially a central office” he said empathizing that the company’s national disaster recovery team responded to thousands of events last year.

Particularly on its FirstNet service AT&T has pioneered two new technologies to try to get bandwidth to disaster-hit regions faster. First it has invested in drones to offer wireless services from the sky. After Hurricane Laura hit Louisiana last year with record-setting winds our “cell towers were twisted up like recycled aluminum cans … so we needed to deploy a sustainable solution” Porter described. So the company deployed what it dubs the FirstNet One — a “dirigible” that “can cover twice the cell coverage range of a cell tower on a truck and it can stay up for literally weeks refuel in less than an hour and go back up — so long-term sustainable coverage” he said.

Secondly the company has been building out what it calls FirstNet MegaRange — a set of high-powered wireless equipment that it announced earlier this year that can deploy signals from miles away say from a ship moored off a coast to deliver reliable connectivity to first responders in the hardest-hit disaster zones.

As the internet has absorbed more of daily life the norms for network resilience have become ever more exacting. Small outages can disrupt not just a first responder but a child taking virtual classes and a doctor conducting remote surgery. From fixed and portable generators to rapid-deployment mobile cell towers and dirigibles telcos are investing major resources to keep their networks running continuously.

Yet these initiatives are ultimately costs borne by telcos increasingly confronting a world burning up. Across conversations with all three telcos and others in the disaster response space there was a general sense that utilities just increasingly have to self-insulate themselves in a climate-changed world. For instance cell towers need their own generators because — as we saw with Texas earlier this year — even the power grid itself can’t be guaranteed to be there. Critical applications need to have offline capabilities since internet outages can’t always be prevented. The machine runs but the machine stops too.

The trend lines on the frontlines are data lines

While we may rely on connectivity in our daily lives as consumers disaster responders have been much more hesitant to fully transition to connected services. It is precisely in the middle of a tornado and the cell tower is down that you realize a printed map might have been nice to have. Paper pens compasses — the old staples of survival flicks remain just as important in the field today as they were decades ago.

Yet the power of software and connectivity to improve emergency response has forced a rethinking of field communications and how deeply technology is integrated on the ground. Data from the frontlines is extremely useful and if it can be transmitted dramatically improves the ability of operations planners to respond safely and efficiently.

Both AT&T and Verizon have made large investments in directly servicing the unique needs of the first responder community with AT&T in particular gaining prominence with its FirstNet network which it exclusively operates through a public-private partnership with the Department of Commerce’s First Responder Network Authority. The government offered a special spectrum license to the FirstNet authority in Band 14 in exchange for the buildout of a responder-exclusive network a key recommendation of the 9/11 Commission which found that first responders couldn’t communicate with each other on the day of those deadly terrorist attacks. Now Porter of AT&T says that the company’s buildout is “90% complete” and is approaching 3 million square miles of coverage.

Why so much attention on first responders? The telcos are investing here because in many ways the first responders are on the frontiers of technology. They need edge computing AI/ML rapid decision-making the bandwidth and latency of 5G (which we will get to in a bit) high reliability and in general are fairly profitable customers to boot. In other words what first responders need today are what consumers in general are going to want tomorrow.

Cory Davis director of public safety strategy and crisis response at Verizon explained that “more than ever first responders are relying on technology to go out there and save lives.” His counterpart Nick Nilan who leads product management for the public sector said that “when we became Verizon it was really about voice [and] what’s changed over the last five [years] is the importance of data.” He brings attention to tools for situational awareness mapping and more that are a becoming standard in the field. Everything first responders do “comes back to the network — do you have the coverage where you need it do you have the network access when something happens?”

The challenge for the telcos is that we all want access to that network when catastrophe strikes which is precisely when network resources are most scarce. The first responder trying to communicate with their team on the ground or their operations center is inevitably competing with a citizen letting friends know they are safe — or perhaps just watching the latest episode of a TV show in their vehicle as they are fleeing the evacuation zone.

That competition is the argument for a completely segmented network like FirstNet which has its own dedicated spectrum with devices that can only be used by first responders. “With remote learning remote work and general congestion” Porter said telcos and other bandwidth providers were overwhelmed with consumer demand. “Thankfully we saw through FirstNet … clearing that 20 MHz of spectrum for first responders” helped keep the lines clear for high-priority communications.

FirstNet’s big emphasis is on its dedicated spectrum but that’s just one component of a larger strategy to give first responders always-on and ready access to wireless services. AT&T and Verizon have made prioritization and preemption key operational components of their networks in recent years. Prioritization gives public safety users better access to the network while preemption can include actively kicking off lower-priority consumers from the network to ensure first responders have immediate access.

Nilan of Verizon said “The network is built for everybody … but once we start thinking about who absolutely needs access to the network at a period of time we prioritize our first responders.” Verizon has prioritization preemption and now virtual segmentation — “we separate their traffic from consumer traffic” so that first responders don’t have to compete if bandwidth is limited in the middle of a disaster. He noted that all three approaches have been enabled since 2018 and Verizon’s suite of bandwidth and software for first responders comes under the newly christened Verizon Frontline brand that launched in March.

With increased bandwidth reliability first responders are increasingly connected in ways that even a decade ago would have been unfathomable. Tablets sensors connected devices and tools — equipment that would have been manual are now increasingly digital.

That opens up a wealth of possibilities now that the infrastructure is established. My interview subjects suggested applications as diverse as the decentralized coordination of response team movements through GPS and 5G; real-time updated maps that offer up-to-date risk analysis of how a disaster might progress; pathfinding for evacuees that’s updated as routes fluctuate; AI damage assessments even before the recovery process begins; and much much more. In fact when it comes to the ferment of the imagination many of those possibilities will finally be realized in the coming years — when they have only ever been marketing-speak and technical promises in the past.

Five Gee

We’ve been hearing about 5G for years now and even 6G every once in a while just to cause reporters heart attacks but what does 5G even mean in the context of disaster response? After years of speculation we are finally starting to get answers.

Naillon of T-Mobile noted that the biggest benefit of 5G is that it “allows us to have greater coverage” particularly given the low-band spectrum that the standard partially uses. That said “As far as applications — we are not really there at that point from an emergency response perspective” he said.

Meanwhile Porter of AT&T said that “the beauty of 5G that we have seen there is less about the speed and more about the latency.” Consumers have often seen marketing around voluminous bandwidths but in the first-responder world latency and edge computing tends to be the most desirable features. For instance devices can relay video to each other on the frontlines without necessarily needing a backhaul to the main wireless network. On-board processing of image data could allow for rapid decision-making in environments where seconds can be vital to the success of a mission.

That flexibility is allowing for many new applications in disaster response and “we are seeing some amazing use cases coming out of our 5G deployments [and] we have launched some of our pilots with the [Department of Defense]” Porter said. He offered an example of “robotic dogs to go and do bomb dismantling or inspecting and recovery.”

Verizon has made innovating on new applications a strategic goal launching a 5G First Responders Lab dedicated to guiding a new generation of startups to build at this crossroads. Nilan of Verizon said that the incubator has had more than 20 companies across four different cohorts working on everything from virtual reality training environments to AR applications that allow firefighters to “see through walls.” His colleague Davis said that “artificial intelligence is going to continue to get better and better and better.”

Blueforce is a company that went through the first cohort of the Lab. The company uses 5G to connect sensors and devices together to allow first responders to make the best decisions they can with the most up-to-date data. Michael Helfrich founder and CEO said that “because of these new networks … commanders are able to leave the vehicle and go into the field and get the same fidelity” of information that they normally would have to be in a command center to receive. He noted that in addition to classic user interfaces the company is exploring other ways of presenting information to responders. “They don’t have to look at a screen anymore and [we’re] exploring different cognitive models like audio vibration and heads-up displays.”

5G will offer many new ways to improve emergency responses but that doesn’t mean that our current 4G networks will just disappear. Davis said that many sensors in the field don’t need the kind of latency or bandwidth that 5G offers. “LTE is going to be around for many many more years” he said pointing to the hardware and applications taking advantage of LTE-M standards for Internet of Things (IoT) devices as a key development for the future here.

Link me to the stars Elon Musk

Michael Martin of emergency response data platform RapidSOS said that “it does feel like there is renewed energy to solve real problems” in the disaster response market which he dubbed the “Elon Musk effect.” And that effect definitely does exist when it comes to connectivity where SpaceX’s satellite bandwidth project Starlink comes into play.

Satellite uplinks have historically had horrific latency and bandwidth constraints making them difficult to use in disaster contexts. Furthermore depending on the particular type of disaster satellite uplinks can be astonishingly challenging to setup given the ground environment. Starlink promises to shatter all of those barriers — easier connections fat pipes low latencies and a global footprint that would be the envy of any first responder globally. Its network is still under active development so it is difficult to foresee today precisely what its impact will be on the disaster response market but it’s an offering to watch closely in the years ahead because it has the potential to completely upend the way we respond to disasters this century if its promises pan out.

Yet even if we discount Starlink the change coming this decade in emergency response represents a complete revolution. The depth and resilience of connectivity is changing the equation for first responders from complete reliance on antiquated tools to an embrace of the future of digital computing. The machine is no longer stoppable.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vaG9tZW5ld3NoZXJlLmNvbS90ZXdrc2J1cnlfdG93bl9jcmllci9zcG9ydHMvYXJ0aWNsZV80NTQ1OTZjMi1hZjhlLTExZWItODQyMi1lMzM5NDlkYzdmMDkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tewksbury High School adds two coaches to spring staff: Scott Wilson takes over the boys track program,"Woburn MA (01801)

A while back we compiled a list of the lamest banners in sports -- ridiculous absurd and stupendously ill-advised flags officially-scantioned by a team or organization raised for posterity out of (and we use the term loosely) pride. Topping our list? The Washington Mystics' 2002 and 2003 WNBA ATTENDANCE CHAMPION banners hanging monuments to the everlasting glory of uh people showing up.

Anyway it looks like someone was listening.

Posting at his ""Ted's Take"" blog Washington Capitals owner Ted Leonsis just announced that he plans to take the banners down. His reason? In Leonsis' words ""the only banners we should display revolve around winning a division or conference or league championship.""

Amen brother.

There's a reason the Capitals have gone from chumps to contender -- from moribund to hot ticket -- under Leonsis' watch. There's a reason the staggering strip-mined Wizards likely will improve now that Leonsis is set to assume control of the franchise. And who knows? Perhaps the Mystics -- a club whose first season was 3-27 and that has been snakebitten ever since -- may even own some laundry worth hoisting someday. Success starts with leadership at the top from the Verizon Center rafters on down."

After decades of struggle we’re finally seeing real-world life-changing applications right here in Philadelphia. Has medicine finally got gene therapy right?

Sign up to stay on top of Philly's growing health innovation scene.

Think back to last spring. (You probably don’t want to but humor me.) Those early months of the coronavirus pandemic in America weren’t all fear and chaos — though there certainly was that. There was also optimism which when one looks back on it now seems completely untethered from reality.

You almost certainly heard it: Flu is worse. We are very very ready for this. We’re just shutting down for two weeks. Considering our national death toll of more than half a million and counting the optimism was clearly misplaced. Even so one rosy prediction came true in a big way.

In March 2020 we were told a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 was a year to 18 months off — even though normal vaccine development takes years often more than a decade with no guarantee of success. We still don’t have vaccines to prevent AIDS or childhood RSV infections.

But on November 9th pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and BioNTech announced that their two-dose vaccine was more than 90 percent effective in preventing COVID-19. Another company Moderna soon released similar news.

It turns out we had a lot going in our favor: a relatively easy-to-target virus a gush of money faster regulatory approval — and for those first two vaccines a breakout technology.

Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use a molecular relative of DNA called RNA to train the body to fight off the coronavirus. These vaccines belong to a larger cadre of treatments that employ DNA which makes up genes and RNA which in cells is derived from DNA. Both molecules contain instructions for the production of proteins which cells need for nearly everything they do. Problems with proteins such as the inability to manufacture a certain type can lead to disease.

Some gene therapies work by supplying cells with new genetic material to compensate for disease-causing errors in genes often by replacing missing proteins. Others endow cells with the ability to produce an entirely new protein. The vaccines for example give our cells the ability to briefly make a key piece of the virus so the immune system can learn to attack it.

Scientists have long sought to use genetic material as medicine but doing so successfully has taken time and tears. Once-promising therapies have proven ineffective or impractical; some caused dangerous even fatal complications in patients who tested them. Clinical trials starting in the late 1990s for example led to cases of leukemia in some children treated for a rare immune condition and to the death of an 18-year-old who suffered a massive inflammatory response to another therapy.

In recent years however researchers appear to have worked out some of the major issues by for example changing how genetic material is delivered to cells. Nowadays a number of gene therapies are official tools of American medical care.

“Having lived through a couple of decades of hype and hope and then realism I think that for the first time there have been major advances in the gene therapy space that show us it can work” says Beverly Davidson a neuroscientist and gene therapy research faculty member at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania. About 30 years ago she began exploring gene therapy as a means to treat degenerative neurological conditions such as Huntington’s disease.

When effective the emerging class of gene therapies can improve and even save lives. These treatments are already giving new hope to some cancer patients and relief to those suffering from certain debilitating genetic conditions. But with progress come new challenges. Doctors have had to learn to manage the potentially dangerous side effects of the cancer treatment for example. And even if a gene therapy appears to have successfully treated a disorder it’s often unclear how long the relief will last.

Researchers meanwhile continue to tinker with these therapies in hopes of improving them and adapting them to other diseases raising the question: How far can gene therapy go?

The Future Is Now

Gene therapy took on a pandemic. What’s next?

The field of gene therapy has deep roots in the biotech industry and hospitals here in Philadelphia. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are no exception.

In 1985 a Hungarian scientist named Katalin Karikó arrived at Temple University. At the time she hoped to use RNA to treat viral infections but an experimental attempt to treat HIV proved unsuccessful. In the years that followed she struggled to maintain support for her research.

Meanwhile scientists elsewhere had preliminary success injecting rodents with a specific variety of RNA called mRNA — a molecule transcribed from DNA that the cell uses to make protein. This molecule however had drawbacks. In large enough amounts for instance it could provoke dangerous levels of inflammation.

A few years later Karikó landed at Penn. In 1998 she met Drew Weissman a physician-scientist who wanted to make an HIV vaccine. By tweaking one of the four letters comprising mRNA’s genetic code the two researchers found they could reduce the ex­treme immune response. What’s more the altered mRNA had a much more potent effect on the activity of cells. “It was unbelievable the dream come true” Karikó says.

This discovery opened the door to a new category of vaccines as well as other therapies. By the time the pandemic began efforts were already well under way to develop mRNA for use in vaccines to protect against infectious diseases. BioNTech the German company where Karikó is now a senior vice president had partnered with Pfizer to develop a vaccine for flu an effort that became the basis for the company’s coronavirus vaccine. It was an easy swap. Conventional vaccines require the actual virus or pieces of it to teach the immune system to recognize and fight the real thing. However the mRNA vaccines don’t use the virus at all just the genetic instructions to make a small piece of it so researchers can easily alter that code to tell the cells to make part of a new virus. Afterward the mRNA is packaged up in fatty spheres that ferry it through the body and into cells.

Roughly nine months after COVID-19 formally became a pandemic vaccinations began in the U.S. On December 18 2020 Karikó and Weissman received their COVID-19 shots together in an event organized by Penn to encourage trust in the vaccines.

Today researchers and biotech companies including BioNTech are exploring ways to use mRNA both with and without the one-letter tweak to treat or prevent a horde of familiar threats: HIV cancer heart failure genetic disorders even autoimmune diseases. There are so many different applications Karikó says that “this is beyond even my imagination.”

Already Changing Lives

CAR-T therapies are evolving cancer treatment options.

The mRNA vaccines aren’t the only COVID shots to take a genetic approach. Others including those developed by Johnson & Johnson and Oxford-AstraZeneca as well as Russia’s Sputnik V deliver genetic instructions in the form of DNA to make part of the coronavirus. Taken together COVID-19 vaccines will touch millions if not billions of lives.

By comparison most gene therapies now on the market are more boutique than big-box offering relief to people with specific conditions. One of these a new class of gene-based cancer treatments called CAR-T has given oncologists a new way to beat back previously intractable cases of blood cancer.

In 2016 Jeff Tracy went to the doctor with a lump the size of half an egg on the left side of his neck. He had chronic leukemia. At first his cancer — malignant B cells once a normal part of his immune system — grew relatively slowly. But in time his indolent cancer turned aggressive presenting a more immediate threat to his life. He received a bone marrow transplant but the cancer returned. “Anytime you relapse after a bone marrow transplant the prognosis is very very poor” says David L. Porter a hematologist-oncologist at Penn who treated Tracy. A quick relapse was even worse.

Tracy’s wife Penny was with her husband when Porter gave them the news that the transplant appeared to have failed. The doctor said he wanted a week to think about what to do next.

After the couple left his office they followed their standard post-appointment ritual. “When we got to the elevator we would give each other a kiss and say it was a good day” Penny says. “Even when we found out the bone marrow transplant didn’t work we still gave each other a kiss and said ‘It’s a good day; he’s thinking about us.’ Because as long as Porter is thinking about us that means we have hope.”

A week later Porter recommended a new treatment called CAR-T. And this is where fortune cut Jeff Tracy a break.

The previous year in 2017 the FDA had approved the first two CAR-T therapies giving doctors permission to use them for specific types of difficult-to-treat blood cancer. Tracy’s chronic leukemia had developed into one of them large B-cell lymphoma and the timing of his relapse in the spring of 2018 meant he could receive the CAR-T treatment called Yescarta.

The drug would be Tracy’s own T cells another type of immune cell harvested from his blood and like characters from a comic book genetically altered to possess an unnatural power: to find and destroy their former comrades the now-malignant B cells.

Tracy welcomed this option. “I wasn’t afraid. I was anxious to get it started” he says.

First he had to temporarily give up his T cells. While he lay in a hospital bed a centrifuge separated them from his blood the rest of which was returned through an intravenous line. The cells were sent across the country to a manufacturing facility in California where they received the genetic instructions to make an artificial protein known as a chimeric antigen receptor or CAR. Scientists had designed this protein to latch onto both healthy and cancerous B cells. With its guidance Tracy’s altered T cells would destroy his B cells.

A few weeks later on August 21st Tracy got his cells back intravenously. The most difficult part came next.

The newly empowered T cells can instigate an intense flu-like illness. For Tracy this manifested as a fever that spiked as high as 104 degrees Fahrenheit. He did escape the more mysterious neurological side effects which can include confusion difficulty speaking and writing and even seizures.

Nearly three years out his cancer is still gone. Not only have the malignant B cells disappeared; some healthy ones have returned. He does however suffer from graft-vs.-host disease an immunological condition caused by his unsuccessful bone marrow transplant. It has left him with mouth sores dry eyes and tight skin that hinders his movements.

“Is it a pain in the butt? At times yes but you know what? I’m aboveground so I don’t care” says Tracy now 62.

When CAR-T works it can be dramatically effective for adult lymphoma Porter says. “But it doesn’t work in everybody” he adds. “And while many patients respond only about 40 percent have long-term ongoing responses. Jeff is one of those people.”

Doctors want to increase those odds as well as offer the therapy to more of their patients. Right now they have permission to treat blood cancers with CAR-T only in patients who have relapsed or fail to respond to conventional options like chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant.

“Potentially CAR-T can completely change how we treat patients” says Henry Fung a Fox Chase Cancer Center hematologist-oncologist. Like Porter he hopes to see the therapy offered to patients earlier in the course of their illnesses.

“In the future we may be able to prevent relapse” he says. “Then we may not need transplants anymore and we may not need chemotherapy anymore.”

Already as doctors have figured out how to manage the potentially dangerous side effects they’ve been able to offer the treatment to more people. “When we first started” says Fung “I was very reluctant to do it for anyone older than 55 years old. But now I don’t have any problem with 70-year-olds.”

He sees one mundane — but major — drawback to CAR-T: accessibility. As a new highly specialized treatment CAR-T can only be administered at medical centers accredited to perform bone marrow transplants. Patients who live in remote rural locations can face logistical difficulties accessing these centers which are often in urban areas at major hospitals.

Preparing the cells also requires a lot of time — a precious commodity for cancer patients. During the three-to-four-week wait to get their cells back patients can see their diseases worsen — or they can die Fung says. He’s now involved in clinical trials for a potential solution: pre-made CAR-T cells available on demand. “If it works there will be another major revolution” he says.

While doctors anticipate treating more blood cancers this way there are also efforts under way to see if genetically engineered T cells can effectively treat solid cancers like those of the lung or pancreas.

Clearing the Hurdles

New therapies for hemophilia are closing in on the finish line.

Cancer isn’t the only disease for which doctors expect to gain new options relatively soon. The FDA anticipates approving a growing number of gene therapies. New treatments for hemophilia a blood-clotting disorder may be among them.

In April of 2017 Bill Maurits who has hemophilia B — one of two common forms of this disorder — received one of these experimental therapies at CHOP through an intravenous line in his left arm.

Because of a genetic mutation Maurits 51 doesn’t have enough of the numerous clotting factors that in domino-like fashion collaborate to cause blood to coagulate. Without this clotting factor a protein called factor IX Maurits’s clots “are like a brick wall with no mortar” he says. “They’re there but they don’t have any strength or holding power.”

As a teenager Maurits played full-contact sports and jumped BMX bikes — all the things other kids in his neighborhood did but his doctor discouraged. The impacts against pavement and other kids didn’t cause him to gush blood but they did exact a toll. Blood leaked into his joints inflicting pain swelling and long-term damage. While the bleeding required numerous transfusions in his early childhood eventually treatment evolved and he started getting injections of clotting factor IX instead.

That meant a needle inserted into a vein in his left arm which eventually became so scarred that he could no longer feel the punctures. When Maurits read about a clinical trial for a gene therapy he saw a way out. “If nothing else I could reduce the number of infusions and number of times I had to stick myself” he says. “Just that by itself would be a plus. Because no matter what any hemophiliac says no matter how easy they say it is to stick themselves sticking yourself sucks.”

The first clinical trial testing a gene therapy for hemophilia began in 1998. At the time the disease seemed like low-hanging fruit. Not only does it have a simple genetic cause; a treatment wouldn’t need to be 100 percent effective since a person can get by with lower-than-normal levels of the missing factor.

However attempts to develop gene therapies for hemophilia as for other diseases have faced formidable technical challenges. First off the new genes must get into the right places and cells there must use them to produce enough of the protein a person lacks to actually matter.

“If you don’t make enough of the protein there’s nothing else to talk about right? You need to go over that hurdle first” says Denise Sabatino a gene therapy researcher at CHOP and Penn who works on hemophilia.

To make gene therapies safer and more effective scientists have looked into improving the delivery method among other things. The new genes are often ferried into cells inside the empty shells of viruses which can’t cause infection. Over the past 20 years researchers have developed new viral shuttles as well as a virus-free method — the one employed by the mRNA vaccines.

The gene therapy that caught Maurits’s attention which is now Pfizer’s Benegene uses an updated viral shuttle to deliver the gene. After a conversation with Lindsey George a hematologist and director of clinical in vivo gene therapy at CHOP and the lead investigator on the trial Maurits felt comfortable signing up. “They’ve come a long way to the point where there really wasn’t as far as I saw a whole lot of risk involved” he says.

The infusion of new genes took about an hour and within a week or so it started to kick in. Maurits’s factor IX levels remain below normal but have increased enough that he’s nearly stopped injecting it getting it only for surgeries including one to replace a knee destroyed by bleeding. Physical activity still makes his damaged joints sore but he bounces back much more quickly. “It was life-changing honestly” he says.

Of the 15 participants Maurits is the only one to bleed since receiving the therapy George says. So far no major safety concerns have emerged. “It’s clearly liberating for them. They’re able to just kind of wake up and live their lives” George says. “I find it humbling that a one-hour intravenous infusion of a medication can end up making this long-lasting remarkable improvement in people’s lives.”

For Maurits the improvement he’s experienced feels almost like a cure. Researchers aren’t ready for that word.

“At this moment in time we don’t really know how long the expression will last after gene therapy” Sabatino says. “We hope it will last for the lifetime of the patient. But we don’t actually know yet.”

On the Horizon

Untangling genes’ roles in heart disease in the quest for new therapies

As diseases go hemophilia makes for a comparatively amenable target. The country’s most prolific killer heart disease is another story. This organ can malfunction in many ways and for any number of reasons. Over the past few decades a number of drugs devices and procedures have been developed to keep the heart pumping.

Gene therapy isn’t among them but that’s not for lack of trying. Researchers and biotech companies are actively working on treatments for heart problems.

One prospective therapy in development in Philadelphia has roots in a tragedy. In 1983 a 23-year-old named Lisa Berger died at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore after being diagnosed with congestive heart failure. Doctors told the family that it was probably a coxsackievirus infection — typically the cause of hand foot and mouth disease in children — that had damaged her heart.

“I think everyone in the family just assumed she had a weak heart” says Dana Weidman Berger’s cousin. But in the years that followed one of Weidman’s brothers suffered heart failure too and she became suspicious.

“I started saying ‘There’s no way they have a virus’” says Weidman now 57. A filmmaker who teaches at a New York State community college she documented her search for answers in an independent film Nobody’s Perfect.

In it she describes how the family suffers from a condition formally known as dilated cardiomyopathy. It occurs when the heart muscle weakens and stretches like a worn-out elastic waistband potentially to the point where it can’t pump enough blood. The condition often arises as a result of coronary artery disease but sometimes the muscle dilates for no obvious reason. Over the years researchers have attributed a growing portion of these mysterious cases to genetic mutations.

In 2003 a cardiologist at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital connected the Weidmans to Arthur Feldman a cardiologist who studies the genetic causes of heart disease. Feldman gathered blood samples from family members willing to provide them but it would be another decade before he and some colleagues could pin down the mutation: a small section missing from the DNA within a gene known as BAG3.

As the team was preparing to publish this discovery in 2014 Feldman requested Berger’s medical records. Among them he spotted his own signature and realized that decades before he had cared for her while he was a medical resident at Johns Hopkins. “Sadly we really didn’t have anything to offer at the time” he says. “It was so devastating when she died.”

It was then that he resolved to further study BAG3 with the goal of helping patients like Berger. In the years that followed he and his colleagues tested a preliminary form of gene therapy in mice with BAG3 mutations. By delivering working copies of BAG3 they found they could improve the rodents’ hearts’ ability to pump blood.

Feldman now at Temple University has since founded a biotech company Renovacor to develop this therapy which is still being tested in animals. While some evidence suggests that raising BAG3 levels could help heart patients without mutations Renovacor is focused on developing a therapy specifically for the roughly 50000 Americans in whom defects in BAG3 produce dilated cardiomyopathy. If successful such a therapy would bring new precision to the treatment of at least a tiny portion of heart patients.

Scientists believe that genetics contribute to most diseases at least to some degree. However finding ways to tailor patients’ care to their genetic vulnerabilities — through gene therapies or by other means — has proven challenging.

It turns out genes and disease have a complex relationship. Take BAG3: It’s one of dozens of genes linked to dilated cardiomyopathy. Different mutations in BAG3 can produce different disorders including neurological ones. And of course many cases of dilated cardiomyopathy don’t have a clear genetic cause. Weidman and her mother Dottie now 82 appear to have benefited from such vagaries. Both carry the family’s mutation but have led largely healthy lives.

Feldman however is optimistic noting that the pace with which research is teasing out these connections has accelerated enormously since he was introduced to Weid­man’s family nearly 20 years ago. Now for instance it takes just days for a commercial lab to deliver a readout of the section of a person’s genetic code that contains BAG3.

“We’re kind of beginning that journey” Feldman says of attempts to uncover the genetic underpinnings of disease. “The world has opened up to us.”

Editing Out Disease?

Gene-editing technology CRISPR-Cas9 is giving researchers even more options.

Over time researchers have devised a number of ways to manipulate the genetic activity within cells often by giving them new DNA or RNA instructions to follow.

A gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 could make it possible to finesse these changes by revising a part of the genetic code a cell already possesses — akin to rewriting the original directions rather than adding new instructions alongside them.

CRISPR the subject of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry gives researchers not only more precise control but also more options says Stephan Grupp a pediatric oncologist at CHOP. “You can do a lot more than just put a gene in although putting a gene in is a pretty impressive thing to do all by itself.”

In experiments for instance it’s possible to direct CRISPR to the exact spot needed to fix a broken gene add or turn one off he says. The FDA has yet to approve any gene therapy using CRISPR but clinical trials have begun testing a few of these experimental treatments in people. Grupp is involved in one such study focused on sickle cell disease a painful genetic disorder resulting from a faulty version of the protein hemoglobin in red blood cells.

That treatment which Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics are developing switches off the production of abnormal hemoglobin and turns on a healthy type of the protein. CRISPR accomplishes this swap by changing a key gene in blood-forming cells while they’re outside the body; the altered cells are then returned to the patient.

At the beginning of the study researchers hoped to reduce the episodes of acute pain that accompany sickle cell disease. Early results suggest they exceeded their goal: The episodes appear to have stopped entirely for all three patients who received the treatment.

In December the first patient treated had been episode-free for nearly a year and a half and so far there appears to be no lasting side effects. No one knows however how long the treatment will continue to be effective. “We hope it lasts forever” Grupp says “but we have no idea.”

Other studies have begun testing CRISPR-based gene therapy in people suffering from an inherited form of blindness and in cancer patients. Many more preliminary efforts are seeking to use gene editing to attack other illnesses including one that has for decades eluded medical science’s ability to cure.

About 35 years ago early in Temple University neurovirologist Kamel Khalili’s career in science he remembers talking with his mentor National Cancer Institute researcher George Khoury about another deadly virus: human immunodeficiency virus or HIV which had recently been identified as the cause of a fatal immune-system-disabling syndrome.

At the time scientists knew the virus didn’t just infect cells; it infiltrated their genetic code inserting its own genes into the cell’s DNA the entirety of which is known as the genome.

“We were just saying that the only way one can cure the disease is to eliminate the virus from the host genome” says Khalili. “But we didn’t know how we could do it. We didn’t have a tool; we didn’t have the knowledge.”

The arrival of CRISPR offered Khalili the tool he needed. He and his colleagues adapted it to excise the viral code from the genomes of infected cells most of which are part of the immune system. A biotech company Khalili cofounded Excision BioTherapeutics is now developing a gene therapy based on their research.

The company doesn’t yet have approval to start clinical trials in people but preliminary studies with mice and monkeys have given Khalili hope that one day a CRISPR-based gene therapy could accomplish a decades-old goal: curing HIV infection.

“I think it’s long long overdue” he says.

I am now fully clear. How do I go about lifting this ban? Can you explain the law around TB and how it affects the visa process?

Answer: Pursuant to your queries we assume that you are currently residing in your home country as you are permanently banned from entering the UAE due to detection of TB scars while you underwent medical fitness tests.

It should be noted that while applying for residence visa in the UAE all matters related to the medical fitness tests fall under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health and Prevention (the ‘Health Ministry’).

Now that the said TB scars are no longer existing on your lungs you may be able to lift the immigration ban imposed on you based on the provisions of Cabinet Resolution No. 5 of 2016 of UAE. The resolution had amended several provisions on the medical examinations system for availing work and residence visa in the UAE.

As you intend to come back to UAE to lift the existing immigration ban on you you may start with granting a power of attorney to your friend or relative in the UAE which is duly notarised and legalised by local authorities and attested by the UAE embassy in your home country.

It would be prudent on your part to undergo a medical examination in your home country for TB and obtain a medical fitness report from a government-approved medical centre.

Thereafter notarise and legalise the medical fitness report which states you have no TB-related scars or illness. Once the above is completed you may send the attested medical fitness report and the power of attorney granted to your friend or relative who is residing in the UAE.

Finally once your friend or relative receives the aforementioned documents he or she needs to attest them at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in the UAE.

The documents may be submitted to the ministry’s medical fitness centre where you had undergone medical fitness tests previously. Based on the documents submitted by you the Ministry and the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners' Affairs (the ‘GDRFA’) may lift the immigration ban on you.

You may request your friend or relative to contact the Ministry and GDRFA in the emirate where your residence visa was previously rejected due to TB scars for any further queries in this regard.

Further you may also contact a legal practitioner in the UAE if you intend to seek professional legal assistance. On the other hand if you intend to come to UAE on employment visa your prospective employer may guide and provide you necessary assistance.

But this isn't the first time SNL has featured a wealthy businessman as host. Donald Trump hosted in 2004 then made a second more controversial appearance in 2015; and back in 1996 the Forbes Media CEO and then-presidential candidate Steve Forbes hosted. So while some people may not be thrilled with the Tesla and SpaceX mogul’s SNL involvement his hosting gig didn’t come out of nowhere — and it’s even less unexpected when you consider Musk’s previous dabblings in satire.

On March 14 2018 Musk tweeted “Thud!” Hours later he followed up: “That’s the name of my new intergalactic media empire exclamation point optional.” At first it was unclear if he was serious butThe Daily Beast clarified with an exclusive: Former Onion editors Ben Berkley and Cole Bolton had been working in Los Angeles on a secret project funded by one of the richest men in the world. At the time Musk told the Daily Beast “It’s pretty obvious that comedy is the next frontier after electric vehicles space exploration and brain-computer interfaces. Don’t know how anyone’s not seeing this.”

Musk was such a big fan of The Onion’s wit that he had previously dubbed it “the greatest publication in the history of all conscious beings living or dead.” He even once expressed interest in buying the website according to The Daily Beast. Instead he co-founded Thud with Berkley and Bolton who had reportedly left The Onion due to creative differences with the site’s new owners Univision in 2017. This arrangement at the intersection of two precarious industries — media and comedy — appeared to be a dream come true. According to The Verge Musk offered about $2 million in funding allowing the former Onion leaders to hire a staff and imagine ambitious projects that would never have been possible within the boundaries of a traditional media company.

Nine of the 13 new Thud staffers were Onion alumni but the budding start-up wasn’t going to play it safe and make another news-satire site — instead the “intergalactic media empire” aimed to create immersive satirical experiences that blurred the lines between reality and parody. As Thud’s Head of Design Jenny Nellis wrote on her portfolio website about the now-defunct project “How the hell do you brand something that is the first and possibly the last of its kind while working with an eccentric billionaire?” (Mic reached out to all 13 of the company’s former employees to comment on Musk’s SNL gig but all of them either declined to comment or didn’t answer our requests.)

Ultimately Thud created several satirical websites most of which remain online as an unconventional (and perhaps unintentional) time capsule. There’s DNA Friend a website that traces your ancestry by taking webcam photos of your mouth; TacStorm a gun that never stops firing; Ploog a universal orifice adapter; and Mampfen a satirical guide to L.A. restaurants. These projects bled into the real world: Mampfen published an actual physical dining guide; and Spitty a human-sized spit droplet danced around New York City to promote DNA Friend.

Thud's projects were like optical illusions — the websites’ sleek designs are familiar yet strange enough to elicit a sense that something’s wrong. In a way this model foreshadowed the company’s unfortunate fate. It had the money and talent necessary to succeed but two years later Thud’s existence feels like a collective fever dream. So where did Thud go wrong?

The company had big plans teasing projects like a museum installation that would chronicle the British conquest of Heaven poking fun at the nation’s long colonialist history. But none of these expansive installations came to fruition and the only remains we have of Thud are these fake product websites a kind of digital graveyard. Thud didn’t even have a centralized homepage where fans could keep up with new projects; it simply wasn’t set up to retain an audience make a profit or sustain itself likely because it didn’t really need to — until Musk pulled funding that is. By the time Thud launched publicly in March 2019 Musk had already backed out of the project. He had contributed initial funding but didn’t require his colleagues to have a business plan The Verge reported so they seemingly didn’t create one. When you have the ultra-rich SpaceX founder in your pocket why go fishing for subscriptions like a public radio station?

But once he was already in too deep — with 13 employees working to break new ground in satirical media — Musk feared Thud’s work might be weaponized against Tesla and SpaceX so he sold it to his co-founders. That didn’t bode well for the future of the company. As Bolton told The Verge when Thud folded in 2019 “Making a swift transition from being a billionaire-backed project to an independent media company is... You know.”

But beyond these very understandable hurdles the projects Thud created just weren’t funny enough to develop an audience as devoted as The Onion’s. To be fair cracking jokes probably isn’t easy when your billionaire investor backs out months before launch. But while Thud’s websites did succeed in creating new realities they weren’t worlds that were fun to exist in. DNA Friend mocks the popularity of products like 23andMe and Ancestry (“We only share your data with third parties who explicitly request it or who seem like they’d be pleased if it appeared in front of them”) yet some of the humor leaves — spit pun not intended — a bad taste in your mouth (“DNA Friend offers to eliminate any unwanted ethnic heritage from your genetic profile for just $40 per percentage point”). TacStorm the continually firing gun satirizes the lack of American gun control — yet the fake commercial behind the fake product is more depressing than funny or thought-provoking. The best satire inspires us to consider things from a different perspective but these projects failed to live up to the hype of an Elon Musk-funded ex-Onion powerhouse.

Thud began with a bang and ended with a whimper.. Perhaps the remains of Thud’s website say it all: “Thud was a short-lived comedy company. It was very aptly named.”

Maybe Musk will nod to his ill-fated satirical ventures in his opening SNL monologue but in the meantime I’m still trying to make sense of the Ploog.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vY3VsdHVyZXNzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzA4L3NhdmVkLWJlbGwtY2FzdC1wbGFubmluZy10cmlidXRlLWR1c3Rpbi1kaWFtb25kLXNlYXNvbi0yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Saved by the Bell cast planning a tribute to Dustin Diamond in season 2,,,,,,,,,,

It has been ranked 53rd in the list of Global Powers of Retailing improvement from 56th earlier according to the Deloitte report.

The list is topped by US giant Walmart Inc which retains its position as world's top retailer. Amazon.com Inc improved its position to rank second. Costco Wholesale Corporation of US slipped a rank to be placed third followed by Schwarz Group of Germany.

The top 10 has seven US retailers and one from the UK (Tesco PLC at 10th position). Other US retailers in the top 10 include The Kroger Co (ranked 5th) Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (6th) and CVS Health Corporation (ranked 9th). Germany's Aldi Einkauf GmbH & Co. oHG and Aldi International Services GmbH & Co. oHG is placed at 8th position.

Reliance Retail is the only Indian entry in the global list of 250 retailers. It features consecutively for the 4th time in the list of Global Powers of Retailing and World's Fastest Retailers.

""Reliance Retail last year's Fastest 50 leader dropped to second place. The company recorded YoY growth of 41.8 per cent driven primarily by a 13.1 per cent increase in the number of stores in its consumer electronics fashion and lifestyle and grocery retail chains to 11784 stores across 7000+ towns and cities in India at fiscal year end (FY20)"" Deoitte said.

E-commerce it said is a second growth driver through both digital commerce (B2C) and B2B.

""The company is partnering with WhatsApp to further accelerate Reliance Retail's digital commerce business on the JioMart platform using WhatsApp and to support small businesses on WhatsApp"" it said. ""Reliance Retail acquired the 29 stores of Shri Kannan Departmental Store at the end of FY2019 and in August 2020 announced it would acquire Future Group's retail wholesale and logistics units for USD 3.4 billion.""



When fully approved the deal will almost double Reliance Retail's store space.

Reliance Retail also made two e-commerce acquisitions in 2020 buying Vitalic Health and its online pharmacy platform Netmeds in August and a 96 per cent stake in online home decor company UrbanLadder in November.

On global outlook Deloitte said in the early months of 2021 the world was faced with both promise and peril.

""On the positive side the distribution of vaccines for COVID-19 was under way offering the promise that sometime later in the year the negative impact of the virus could abate significantly. On the negative side the virus continued to threaten economic stability especially in those parts of the world where it was still prevalent and threatened to be a problem elsewhere if new and virulent strains of the virus were spread widely"".

Even in places where the outbreak was limited there was a negative economic impact from social distancing measures to avoid a further outbreak it said adding the challenge for policymakers was to control the current outbreak protect those who have been disrupted by it and speed up the distribution of approved vaccines.

The speed and success of these three imperatives will determine the path of the global economy in the year ahead it added.",,,,,,,,,,,,

By Karisa Sprague Senior Vice President U.S. Supply Chain People and Heather Haberer Vice President U.S. Field People Operations

No doubt about it being a working mom can be tough. We realize that working while raising kids asks a lot of our associates which is why we’ve prioritized creating great jobs that provide access flexibility stability and opportunity — all aimed at making Walmart the place for working moms. That includes unique resources benefits and much-needed recognition for our associates no matter what phase of motherhood they’re in.

Here are a few of the ways we’re celebrating the moms we have the privilege of working alongside.

At Walmart we prioritize our associate family by making it easy for them to prioritize their own families. We support new moms with up to 16 weeks of paid leave for eligible U.S. associates to welcome a child into their family and provide that special time to bond.

Our new moms tell us their paid maternity and parental leave benefits allow them the time to adjust to the demands of motherhood without worrying about work just like Walmart market manager and new mom Arianna Bonutti.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdGFsa2J1c2luZXNzLm5ldC8yMDIxLzA1L3dhbG1hcnQtYW5ub3VuY2VzLXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbi1wcm9tb3Rpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart announces supply chain promotions,"Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner recently announced two top promotions in the retailer’s supply chain and logistics operations.

Many parks such as Disney World have not seen any fireworks return except for some pyrotechnic effects during the holidays whereas other parks such as Tokyo Disneyland did attempt to bring back evening firework shows.

Disneyland Resort also just reopened their gates after over a full year of closures also to no firework spectacular. Recently we wrote that Disney was hiring a Principal Firework Designer and now it looks like the Walt Disney Company is expanding their firework team as they are hiring a seasonal Fireworks & Special Effects Designer. The job description seems to hint that the Cast Member hired for the position would be developing firework shows for all parks as well as Disney Cruise Line.

The Fireworks & Special Effects Designer develops/executes pyrotechnic and special effects designs for live shows across property including Parks Resorts Special Events and DISNEY CRUISE LINE®.

If Disney is looking to hire multiple people to fill positions that will help bring fireworks to life across Disney there likely is some sort of motive and need which would mean that Disney is on its way to bringing more fireworks back to its parks and cruise line!

At the moment Disney has not made any announcement about more firework shows returning to their parks so this is purely speculation but typically a job posting for any company is only created if the company needs help in a certain area. If Disney was not thinking about fireworks in any capacity hiring multiple firework designers would not make too much sense.

So what do we know about firework shows returning to Disney? If we look at Disney World this is where I would personally see the most work needing to be done over the upcoming months and years. HarmonioUS is the new EPCOT evening show that Disney World is getting ready to debut for its 50th-anniversary celebration at EPCOT. We do know that the show will include fireworks and as the barges are continuously being tested perhaps they are now beginning to coordinate the firework aspect of the show.

Speaking of the 50th-anniversary celebration it would be very fun to see a new firework show debut at Magic Kingdom! Although Happily Ever After has not been played on Cinderella Castle for quite some time as the vaccine rollout continues to increase across America it could be possible that at some point during the anniversary that the state of the world will return to a safe environment once more and a show could be displayed on the castle to commemorate the huge birthday being celebrated through to 2023 at Disney World.

Disney has recently started testing fireworks after hours at both Magic Kingdom Park and EPCOT. Hopefully these new job postings mean that Guests will be able to finally see fireworks shows sooner rather than later!

All of this being said again it is purely speculation until Disney makes the announcement of when exactly fireworks shows are returning to Disney World and other parks. Personally I do hope that this means that we will see more firework shows return to Disney Parks worldwide and perhaps even on DCL once their ships are finally able to set sail.

Would you be more inclined to visit a Disney Park if you knew their firework show returned?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9kaXNuZXktY29ycC1hc2tzLWVtcGxveWVlcy1jb21wbGV0ZS13aGl0ZS1wcml2aWxlZ2UtY2hlY2tsaXN0LXBpdm90LWF3YXktd2hpdGUtZG9taW5hbnQtMTU4OTc3NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney Asks Employees to Complete 'White Privilege Checklist': Leaked Docs,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/disney-corp-asks-employees-complete-white-privilege-checklist-pivot-away-white-dominant-1589775 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS9kaXNuZXktY29ycC1hc2tzLWVtcGxveWVlcy1jb21wbGV0ZS13aGl0ZS1wcml2aWxlZ2UtY2hlY2tsaXN0LXBpdm90LWF3YXktd2hpdGUtZG9taW5hbnQtMTU4OTc3NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsaWNrb3JsYW5kby5jb20vdGhlbWUtcGFya3MvMjAyMS8wNS8wOS9hLWNlbGVicmF0aW9uLW9mLWZlc3RpdmFsLW9mLXRoZS1saW9uLWtpbmctZ2V0cy1kZWJ1dC1kYXRlLWF0LWRpc25leS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'A Celebration of Festival of the Lion King' gets debut date at Disney,"As live entertainment and Disney performers continue to return to Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista Fla. “A Celebration of Festival of the Lion King” will debut May 15 2021 at Disney’s Animal Kingdom.

Disney is pushing critical race theory on employees through a new plan called “Reimagine Tomorrow” urging workers to recognize their “white privilege” in a battery of training modules on topics such as “systemic racism” and “white fragility” according to internal documents obtained by City-Journal’s Christopher Rufo.

Staffers are told to reject “equality” for “equity” and must “reflect” on America’s “racist infrastructure” and “think carefully about whether or not [their] wealth” is derived from racism according to the documents.

In one anti-racism training course called “Allyship for Race Consciousness” workers are taught that the US has a “long history of systemic racism and transphobia” and told they must “take ownership of educating yourself about structural anti-black racism.

Staffers should “not rely on your black colleagues to educate you” which is “emotionally taxing” the docs reportedly instruct

Disney recommends its staffers hit the books suggesting one essay that encourages parents to commit to “raising race-consciousness in children” and which teaches that “even babies discriminate” against members of other races.

The far-left turn by the house of Mickey Mouse has led to sky-high tensions but staffers are terrified about speaking out against the ideology multiple employees told City-Journal.

“There are “almost daily memos suggested readings panels and seminars that [are] all centered around antiracism” one employee told the outlet.

The company is “completely ideologically one-sided” and actively discourages Christian and or conservative workers from speaking their mind the worker said.

“I attended several [training sessions] at the beginning just to see what the temperature of the discussion would be and to gauge if I would be able to bring up my own objections in a safe way—safe meaning for my career. And I’ve continually gotten the unspoken answer: ‘no’” the employee told the outlet.

“It’s been very stifling to feel like everyone keeps talking about having open dialogue and compassionate conversations but when it comes down to it I know if I said one thing that was truthful based on data or even just based on my own personal experience it would actually be rather unwelcomed” the person continued

The company has also backed a “21-Day Racial Equity and Social Justice Challenge” day where participants are told they “all been raised in a society that elevates white culture over others” City-Journal reported.

As part of the challenge staffers learn about their “white privilege” and are asked to fill out a white privilege “checklist” with choices such as: “I am white” “I am heterosexual” “I am a man” “I still identity as the gender I was born in” “I have never been raped” “I don’t rely on public transportation” and “I have never been called a terrorist.”

The company has recently shown a willingness to embrace the new ideology adding “content advisories” to films such as “Dumbo” “Aladdin” and “Fantasia.”

And it fired “Mandalorian” actress Gina Carano in February after she made what were considered right-wing comments on social media.

“The great irony of this is that the people who are in charge of Disney are some of the richest and most powerful and privileged white males in the history of humanity and they are pushing this divisive critical race theory based ideology as corporate dogma and the only end of this is division. It’s self-hatred” Rufo said Friday on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight.”

A Disney spokesperson told The Post Saturday that the internal documents are being “deliberately distorted as reflective of company policy.”

“In fact their purpose was to allow diversity of thought and discussion on the incredibly complex and challenging issues of race and discrimination that we as a society and companies nationwide are facing” the company said noting its “long history of inclusivity with stories that reflect acceptance and tolerance and celebrate people’s differences.”"

It's been the enduring question in the DC Extended Universe lately

By Dylan Balde |

What keeps you up at night: UFOs observing us in our sleep or whether or not Henry Cavill is done playing Superman? If you would sooner have fictional aliens in the box office over the remote possibility of life on other planets then the answer is clear. Is Warner Bros. done with Cavill the same way executives have recently cut cords with Zack Snyder or is Cavill himself no longer aligned with DC and the company’s creative decisions going forward? We know Snyder would keep churning out more Superman movies with Cavill taking the lead if he could. We also know Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson is openly campaigning for more Snyderverse films featuring Henry Cavill. It was once widely reported that Cavill signed on to play Clark Kent in three more Warner Bros. films — punctuated by the Jersey native confirming in an exclusive interview with Men’s Health that “the cape is in the closet” and “still” his — but now we’re not so sure.

If WarnerMedia CEO Ann Sarnoff’s recent Variety interview is proof enough the studio has already distanced itself from Zack Snyder following the small-screen release of his four-hour cut of Justice League and likely Henry Cavill’s Superman along with it. In fact Warner Bros. is already developing a new iteration featuring a black Superman so where does that leave Cavill?

SmallScreen’s Edward Lauder calls for calm and postulates Henry Cavill is indeed still Superman. Lauder has collected enough reports about the nature of the franchise going forward to conclude Warner Bros.’s new black Man of Steel is an Elseworlds character that has nothing to do with Snyder’s Clark Kent. Much like Todd Phillips’s Joker this version of the Kryptonian is set in a different universe as Henry Cavill’s. He’s not a replacement. So whether or not the black Superman is Clark Kent or the Calvin Ellis iteration of the character is irrelevant. Lauder reminds the fanbase that unless Warner Bros. kills off Superman — which it hasn’t — or openly recasts Cavill the English actor remains our one and only DC Extended Universe Clark Kent.

According to The Hollywood Reporter the J.J. Abrams-produced black Superman film “appears to be moving onto its own track and won’t be part of the universe” at least not right now. DC insider Syl Abdul seconds this report. Henry Cavill himself asserts his Superman still has plenty of movies left in him. He tells Men’s Health: “I’m not just going to sit quietly in the dark as all this stuff is going on. I’ve not given up the role. There’s a lot I have to give for Superman yet. A lot of storytelling to do. A lot of real true depths to the honesty of the character I want to get into. I want to reflect the comic books. That’s important to me. There’s a lot of justice to be done for Superman. The status is: You’ll see.”

in the comics Grant Morrison created 'Calvin Ellis' Black Superman.



That version of Superman name was 'Kal-El' as well.



Like the article said this is an Elseworlds story.



Cavill is still in play



[timestamped subject]https://t.co/3vXw0maKsD https://t.co/CVqR6nglk7 — SyL ☕ SYLABDUL.COM (@sylabdul_inc) May 6 2021

Of course this is all one person’s guided assessment; it’s hardly news so take it with a massive grain of salt. Thing is Henry Cavill may no longer be involved in any further DC adaptations with Zack Snyder absent from the helm. These two are practically married at the hip. Snyder made Cavill’s Clark Kent the iconic masterwork he is now and without Snyder who knows what sort of Superman Cavill may end up portraying? Perhaps a cheerier kind modelled after Christopher Reeve’s red and blue boy scout or a total psychopath with despotic tendencies similar to the Injustice Superman? The old Cavill Supes may finally be dead in the water with Snyder no longer involved.

Not only that in show business alternate-reality versions of the same character are only ever one-timers for as long as the film performs poorly critically and at the box office. Just look at Andrew Garfield’s version of Spider-Man. It was a perfectly charming interpretation of the wallcrawler but it tanked so he got rebooted. The Marvel Cinematic Universe’s MJ played by the delightful Zendaya received great praise from fans and critics despite the clear departure from the comic book character hence Disney kept her. The bad news: while Henry Cavill’s performance as the Last Son of Krypton received (and continues to receive) universal acclaim his movies flatlined critically and financially.

The fragmented response to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice emboldened the studio to adopt an entirely new vision away from Zack Snyder. Man of Steel 2 was one of many casualties. Given that Cavill’s DC films — minus the Snyder cut of Justice League — haven’t done so well it’s unlikely for Warner Bros. to authorize more movies with him as Clark Kent. So if the studio’s upcoming black Superman movie earns better than Man of Steel executives may no longer choose to keep Henry Cavill on board.

Nonetheless there can definitely be several versions of the same character at any given time if Andy Muschietti’s The Flash and Matt Reeves’s The Batman are any indication. The Flash features two Batmen Ben Affleck and Michael Keaton from two different timelines. We already know Robert Pattinson’s Bruce Wayne comes from an alternate Earth himself. The Flash movie is obviously Affleck’s long-overdue swan song from the franchise which is regrettable but at least we know for sure he’s out. Warner Bros. may still want Henry Cavill for one more film and that’s it.

Until the studio definitively announces the 38-year-old is gone from the franchise for good there’s no reason to assume Henry Cavill and Warner Bros. are officially broken up. We presumed the same with Ben Affleck — and Zack Snyder’s Justice League — and yet here we are. Anything is possible. Warner Bros. is presumably still at a crossroads regarding the characters Zack Snyder originated; the only reason Cavill’s Superman is on the rocks is because Warner Bros. is officially divorcing from Snyder. It’s like enduring a bad breakup and wanting to get rid of items both you and your ex owned not because that one action figure they bought notably wronged you but because the memories are painful. It’s death (or in this case outright execution) by association. The fact that there are no reports definitively ruling Henry Cavill out proves Warner Bros. is still undecided. If they are done with him the Internet will surely be the first to know.

The black Superman movie is being produced by Bad Robot a film company owned by J.J. Abrams. Abrams was originally hired to direct the film but was later scrapped as Warner Bros. reportedly found the idea “tone-deaf” to the growing concerns of the Black Lives Matter movement. The studio is presently scouting for a black director. Renowned author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates is penning the screenplay. It’s still in development so the details of the plot remain unknown much like the fate of Henry Cavill in the DC Universe.",,,,,,,,,

The short course is one of the capacity-building activities under the Project: Capacity-building in food security for Africa (CaBFoodS-Africa). The CaBFoodS-Africa Project is a collaborative initiative between the University of Pretoria (Lead); the University of Nairobi the University of Ghana and other private sector actors in the food sector under the African Universities Research Alliance (ARUA) Center of Excellence in Sustainable Food Systems (ARUA-SFS) hosted by the University of Pretoria. The training was to increase knowledge and awareness of post-harvest food loss and waste and hence contribute to the capacity-building required to address the problem.

The course was organized and coordinated by Prof. Jane Ambuko a Postharvest Specialist from the Department of Plant Science and Technology who is also the University of Nairobi PI CabsFoods-Africa Project. During course organization Prof. Ambuko was supported by Dr George Abong a Food Scientist from the Department of Food Science Nutrition and Technology; graduate students Duke Gekonge PhD Food Science and Emmanuel Amwoka MSc Horticulture; Mr Paul Ongaro a Senior Technologist in Food Science and Mr Kyle Poorman a communication expert from the Consortium for Innovations in Postharvest Loss and Food Waste Reduction which is hosted by Iowa State University United States of America.

The opening session of the training was attended by the Principal College of Agriculture and Veterinary Sciences Prof. Rose Nyikal; the Dean Faculty of Agriculture Prof. Moses Nyangito and the Chairpersons of the Departments involved in the training: Prof. James Muthomi (Department of Plant Science and Crop Protection) and Dr George Abong’ (Department of Food Science Nutrition and Technology). The Director of the ARUA Center of Excellence in Sustainable Food Systems (ARUA-SFS) Prof. Lindiwe Sibanda spoke of the opportunity to sensitize participants about ARUA-SFS – its strategic vision priorities the theory of change and programmes.

It is noteworthy that the training initially targeted only three facilitators and 20 trainees from Africa but attracted 13 facilitators and 70 trainees. This was made possible as the course was offered on-line because of Covid-related movement restrictions. The 13 facilitators are global experts in post-harvest management from around the world including officers from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) universities and other training institutions. The 70 food supply chain practitioners were drawn from public and private institutions and organizations. They included researchers/academia county agricultural officers extension officers traders private sector actors processors farmers development partners non-governmental organizations community-based organizations among others representing nine African countries and three countries outside of Africa.

Training took place in three sessions over three days:

A session on virtual theory covered 13 modules delivered by experts in post-harvest management.

During the virtual practical session participants watched pre-recorded practical sessions in wet and dry processing of fruits and vegetables (at the Food Processing Hub); processing of diary products including fresh and fermented milk plain yoghurt mango fruit enriched yoghurt and cheese and processing of meat products (mainly sausages). The session was complemented with presentations that provided an overview of the recorded practical. After watching the video participants took part in a lively question and answer session. You can watch the recorded practical session here .

. A hands-on practical session on the above topics has been limited to 20 participants from Kenya. This session will be rescheduled at a time when Covid-related restrictions have eased.

At the end of the virtual sessions the participants expressed their appreciation of the training which they found well organized and informative. The County Officers present said they would like to have similar training for officers and food supply chain practitioners in their counties. It was suggested the course could be offered regularly to create awareness of the problem of post-harvest food loss and waste and the available solutions to address the problem.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbW1pbnN0b2RheS5jb20vbG9jYWwtbmV3cy90ZXN0LWRyaWxsaW5nLXJlc3VtZXMtZm9yLW51Y2xlYXItd2FzdGUtc2l0ZS1uZWFyLWlnbmFjZS0zNzU1NTE20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Test drilling resumes for nuclear waste site near Ignace,"The Nuclear Waste Management Organization is also drilling its first borehole at South Bruce.

TORONTO — The Nuclear Waste Management Organization says it has resumed test drilling for a potential underground nuclear waste storage site near Ignace.

Work is continuing on the fourth borehole which was started before the COVID-19 pandemic and preparations are underway for drilling a fifth hole.

NWMO is also drilling its first borehole in the South Bruce area of southern Ontario the only other site in Canada still under consideration for hosting the repository.

It said the testing is an important part of its site selection process.

""We need to be sure that used nuclear fuel can be safely contained in the rock underneath the surface to ensure water is protected and people and the environment are safe"" a spokesperson said.

Once borehole drilling and testing are complete NWMO said it will share the findings with community members.

Field activities can take up to nine months for each hole.

NWMO has developed a close working relationship with the Town of Ignace but says it remains committed to only locate the storage site in an area with ""informed and willing hosts.""

Organized opposition to transporting Canada's used nuclear fuel to Northwestern Ontario and storing it in the region surfaced recently when a group called Nuclear Free North announced it was mailing postcards to 30000 households and businesses between Upsala and the Manitoba border.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHA6Ly9iYXJiYWRvcy5sb29wbmV3cy5jb20vY29udGVudC9nb3Zlcm5tZW50LWdpdmVzLW5ldy13YXN0ZS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LXRodW1ic9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Government gives new waste management project the thumbs up | Loop Barbados,"Households across the island will soon have a convenient tech-savvy way to dispose of recyclables using the new recyclable bin provided by the Sanitation Service Authority in collaboration with Prosource Limited.

Government has given its approval to a new residential waste collection in the country and it is posited that through this new public-private sector partnership initiative Barbados will have a world-leading and technology-driven solution for the efficient collection of residential waste.

Minister of the Environment and National Beautification Adrian Forde said:

""The consequences of COVID-19 climate change and the ashfall caused by the recent eruption of La Soufriere volcano only serve to underscore the importance of solid waste management and the need for efficient waste collection in Barbados. One of the most important tenets of sustainable development is a partnership whether with private entities community groups or individuals. The health and safety of our people are paramount in our environmental planning and development. ""This project will ensure our streets beaches ecosystems wetlands and other areas of biodiversity are maintained. I am eagerly looking forward to this seamless transformation at SSA. My Friends this is who we are.""

According to a press statement the project will vastly improve the efficiency reliability and regularity of waste collections.

Prosource Limited is a part of the Innotech Group and has successfully completed similar projects in the region. Prosource Limited's expertise lies in the residential commercial and industrial waste sector and as such they will provide and implement a fully managed end-to-end solution for the country.

How will it work

In March 2020 the Solid Waste Management Corporation of St Kitts engaged the company to undertake an is-land-wide waste collection improvement project. St Kitts received 12000 bins in their first installment.

Director of Prosource Limited David Tomlinson explained how it will work for the people of Barbados.

""Each household in Barbados will be provided free of charge with a standardized Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) enabled 65-gallon roll-out cart for general waste and an 18-gallon bin to be used for commingled recycling. In addition all the SSA's collection compactor trucks will be retrofitted with market-leading equipment for mechanically lifting the carts. The RFID readers installed on the trucks will track collection activity improve collection efficiency and the in-cab route optimization and management solution will also benefit drivers whilst reducing SSA's operational cost.

""Once implemented the residential waste collection methodology for Barbados will change from a manual system to a much more efficient and safer mechanical operation.""

The solution includes a specialist software system capable of tracking monitoring and providing analytics for waste collection services and operations. It also allows for automated work orders and asset inventory management.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA1LTEwL3ZpY3Rvcmlhbi1jb3VuY2lscy1oaWtlLXdhc3RlLWZlZXMvMTAwMTI2ODEw0gEoaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuYWJjLm5ldC5hdS9hcnRpY2xlLzEwMDEyNjgxMA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Recycling plan and landfill levy increase drives fee hikes at Victorian councils,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-10/victorian-councils-hike-waste-fees/100126810 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA1LTEwL3ZpY3Rvcmlhbi1jb3VuY2lscy1oaWtlLXdhc3RlLWZlZXMvMTAwMTI2ODEw0gEoaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuYWJjLm5ldC5hdS9hcnRpY2xlLzEwMDEyNjgxMA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

But the speed with which aquaculture leases are increasing is “starting to get out of control” he said.

He points to the marked increase in what are called limited purpose aquaculture licenses (LPAs) which are for plots measuring only 400 square feet. The current acting director of DMR’s aquaculture division Marcy Nelson said that LPAs are reviewed by her staff and that landowners within 300 feet of a proposed LPA are given the opportunity to comment on them.

But according to Lewis criteria for LPAs are less stringent than for standard leases there is no published public notice for them and if an LPA is just an extra foot away from shore “the communication link between the town and the public fails to occur” he wrote in an email.

LPAs are indeed proliferating with 722 currently active (there were 450 in 2015). “The best way to describe these LPAs is sprawl” wrote Lewis. “Other [ocean] users have been surprised when they suddenly pop up in the water.”

The lobstermen represented by PMFHF want their own fishing and aquaculture needs to be prioritized by the state. “Let’s talk about planning for the coast and how we’re going to do it” said PMFHF executive director Crystal Canney who said the lobstermen she represents some of whom live in isolated locations with poor access to the internet have been caught off-guard by some of the leasing changes.

There’s another issue among locals according to Pat Burns who started a cooperative in 2019 of (now) 10 oyster farmers who share two leases in Robinhood Cove. And that is fear of further industrial encroachment and consolidation.

“What’s to keep [our co-op] from cashing out and selling to a corporation?” he said. “Philosophically we’re not in that court. But could someone do it? Yes.” Lewis wrote that “the public sees this as speculative where the larger leases will be sold to the highest bidder.”

But he said there’s an actual danger of this happening since standard leases can be transferred without a public hearing which is another thorny topic in these parts.

A major concern for him is that there isn’t enough regulatory oversight to ensure that aquaculture operations aren’t causing more harm than good. By way of example he mentions the “birdfeeder effect.” This occurs under finfish pens when other fish swim over to eat fallen feed; in a well-managed farm there’s usually species diversity while one that accumulates too much urine and fecal waste can result in a barren sea bottom—a situation that used to be monitored by DMR divers but was curtailed when the department’s Finfish Aquaculture Monitoring Program was transferred to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection according to both Lewis and Nelson.

“You need a commensurate investment in regulatory oversight to build public confidence” Lewis said and “nobody knows what farm conditions are under the net pens.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA1LTA5L2J5dGVkYW5jZS10YXJnZXRzLWEtbmV3LTE4NS1iaWxsaW9uLWJ1c2luZXNzLWFoZWFkLW9mLW1lZ2EtaXBv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ByteDance Eyes a New $185 Billion Business Ahead of Mega IPO,"Want the lowdown on what's moving Asia’s markets in your inbox every morning?

According to an OTV ground report at Canal Bridge Khannagar waste water from the city was incessantly being released into Kathajodi River. As a result the river water in the said area had turned black. Similar was the case in Mahandi River near Jobra.

Locals alleged use of the water from the river has been causing skin-related diseases diarrhoea and other ailments. Repeated complaints to Cuttack district administration has fallen on deaf ears they further stated.

“Not only Khannagar the residents of low lying areas like 42 Mouza and Urali are also getting affected because of the polluted river water. The government should come up with a plan to stop release of industrial waste into the rivers at the earliest lest it becomes a reason of medical emergency for those who sustain with the water from these rivers” said a resident of Khannagar Prafulla Sahu.

“Consumption of the polluted water has been a reason of skin diseases among the residents in the locality” alleged Ramesh another localite.

Though there were plans to establish a sewage treatment plant nothing has come off as yet.

Environment campaigner Biswajit Mohanty said “This is the result of the aimlessness of the government. A sewerage treatment plant is the only way out but the Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) is yet to initiate any step in this regard. The authorities concerned resort to blame game saying that JICA work is underway. JICA work is on since the last 10 years and what if it continues for another decade?”

Speaking to OTV CMC Commissioner Ananya Dash stated “In order to separate the drainage and sewerage water JICA project was taken up in Cuttack and is still underway. The sewerage treatment plant is being built at Matagajpur from where the sewage water will get treated and be discharged to the rivers. The drain lines will only carry storm water” informed Das. She however did not respond to the health issues residents face owing to the rampant disposal of sewage into the rivers."

The village and the developer entered into a development agreement on DeBack Farms Business Park located along Interstate 94 just south of Four Mile Road in July 2016. A first amendment came in September 2016 and a second amendment came in July 2018.

The third amendment was approved at Monday’s Village Board meeting. It was in the mutual interest of both the village and Wispark — DeBack Farms Business Park is a Wispark development and Wispark is owned by WEC Energy Group which owns We Energies — to release Outlot 4 of Certified Survey Map 3438 from the DeBack Farms Business Park according to the village’s resolution No. 2021-57.

Outlot 4 is a 1.8-acre parcel that fronts Adams Road and is anticipated to be the future site of the water tower. The village does not have the deed to the land yet.

The motion was approved unanimously.

Village Attorney Elaine Ekes described the amendment as an “adjustment to the profit-sharing formula to reflect additional costs DeBack Farms has incurred.”

Meaning there is no exchange of money but the village quantified the value of the property as $250000 reducing some of the share in profits related to the business as a part of the tax increment district.

The land parcel will additionally be released from restrictive covenants such as constraints on the land use.

“There was an adjustment based on the additional costs as well as the release of this parcel that the village is obtaining as part of the DeBack Farms recent transactions. So that adjustment was based on the financial considerations overall for the additional costs of Wispark” Ekes said.

Ekes said the water tower is “overall good infrastructure” and will eventually be needed for that area.

DeChambeau who is ranked fifth in the world joked Saturday that it was an expensive mistake to have traveled home after the second round and then have to head back on his Netjets private travel deal.

No worries.

With his finish Sunday DeChambeau will make $228825 an amount he said would cover the tab.

""It definitely will for sure"" DeChambeau said after finishing at 280 4 under par. ""But it was more for me. The cost wasn't really anything I was worried about. I really didn't want to disappoint Wells Fargo and Quail Hollow and the guys who put up this tournament and give so much to charity.

""I mean that's one of the things I want to support. And fans out here didn't want to disappoint them. That's something that's super important to me about growing the game. I would definitely make that expense twice twice as much for me to get back here to do that again.""

DeChambeau said Saturday he briefly considered withdrawing Friday night after returning home and learning that his score of 144 2 over par had made the 36-hole cut. He left because at the time he finished he was around 90th place and thought he had no chance.

As it turned out DeChambeau ended up in a tie for 64th 8 shots back of the 36-hole leaders.

""It was worth it. It no doubt was worth it"" he said Sunday. ""That's what I was hoping to do this weekend when I was on that plane at 2:45 a.m. [Saturday]. Yeah I wanted to make it worth it. I didn't want to come out here and finish 60-whatever close to last. Even at that it's still FedEx Cup points it's still world ranking points. I was pleased to have come back and finished. Hopefully I can get inside the top 10 and be there and keep moving up the world rankings.

""The goal is obviously to be No. 1 and I want to be at the Olympics so we'll keep moving forward in the right direction. If I get my driving going next week I like that golf course and hopefully I can play well out there.""

DeChambeau is scheduled to play in this week's AT&T Byron Nelson followed by the PGA Championship a week later.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzA5L3JvcnktbWNpbHJveS1uYXJyb3dseS13aW5zLWF0LXdlbGxzLWZhcmdvLXRvLWVuZC10aXRsZS1kcm91Z2h0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rory McIlroy narrowly wins Wells Fargo Championship to end title drought,"CHARLOTTE N.C. — Rory McIlroy found his comfort zone at Quail Hollow and left with a trophy he badly needed.

McIlroy closed with a 3-under 68 and made it tough on himself at the end Sunday driving into the hazard left of the 18th fairway and needing two putts from 45 feet for a one-shot victory in the Wells Fargo Championship.

What mattered was ending 18 months since his last victory in the HSBC Champions in Shanghai along with finding a strong semblance of his game as he prepares to return to Kiawah Island for the PGA Championship.

“It’s never easy” McIlroy said. “It felt like a long time.”

It showed. McIlroy seemed to be on the verge of choking up at winning on Mother’s Day thinking of his mother Rosie and wife Erica. She was at Quail Hollow with their daughter Poppy and McIlroy doted on them before signing his card.

McIlroy seized control with two splendid bunker shots getting up-and-down for birdie on the reachable par-4 14th and the par-5 15th and then holding on at the end.

Abraham Ancer ran off three straight birdies and nearly closed with a fourth one posting a 66 for a runner-up finish the fourth of his career as the Mexican seeks his first PGA Tour title.

McIlroy finished at 10-under 274 for his 19th career victory and his third at Quail Hollow.

“This is one of my favorite places in the world” said McIlroy who picked up his first PGA Tour title at Quail Hollow in 2010. “The break the drought and win here it’s awesome.”

It was a tough finish for Keith Mitchell who started the final round with a two-shot lead and quickly stretched it to three shots with a 6-iron out of a fairway bunker into a stiffening breeze to 12 feet for birdie.

But his short game let him down all day leading to bogeys on the fifth and sixth holes that cost him the lead and on the 14th hole and 15th holes when he had to settle for pars after being in position for birdies.

Mitchell whose only victory was the Honda Classic just over two years ago needed to finish alone in second to qualify for the PGA Championship through the money list. But he dropped a shot on the 17th and closed with a 72 to tie for third with Viktor Hovland who had a 67.

Former U.S. Open champion Gary Woodland had a share of the lead early on the back nine until he went through a bad patch of back-to-back bogeys on Nos. 12 and 13 and settling for pars on the next two scoring holes. He shot 71 and finished fifth.

Bryson DeChambeau managed a tie for ninth following a 68-68 weekend that began with him flying home to Dallas thinking he had missed the cut.

McIlroy along with going 18 months without a win slipped to No. 15 in the world his lowest position in more than a decade. He brought on swing coach Pete Cowen for an extra set of eyes. They worked hard last week in Florida as McIlroy tried to get back to understanding what he does so well with the golf swing.

Winning is not an instant cure. He hit only three fairways on Sunday and the last one nearly got him in trouble. His ball landed on the hill left of the winding creek just short of the water in a deep hole of shaggy grass. He wisely chose to take a penalty drop instead of gouging it out and he sent an 8-iron towering toward the green landing safely in the fat of the putting surface.

That brought out of the loudest cheers of a day filled with them. The Wells Fargo Championship had more energy than any tournament since golf returned from the pandemic.

Just what McIlroy needed.

He thought he would enjoy some quiet of no spectators. It didn’t take long for him to realize he missed the energy. “To bring out the best in myself I needed this” he said.

And when it was over he turned and heaved his golf ball toward thousands of fans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53Y25jLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Nwb3J0cy9nb2xmL3dlbGxzLWZhcmdvL21jaWxyb3ktd2lucy13ZWxscy1mYXJnby1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAvMjc1LTNjMjVmOTM0LTNkMDYtNDE4Yy1hNDg3LWQ2OTJmN2IxMjJjMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Wells Fargo Championship: Rory McIlroy wins | wcnc.com,"This is McIlroy's third Wells Fargo Championship win.

CHARLOTTE N.C. — Rory McIlroy has won the 2021 Wells Fargo Championship. It’s the first time in two years the event has been held due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is McIlroy's third Wells Fargo Championship win.

""Ever since I first set eyes on this golf course I loved it from the first time I played it and that love has sort of been reciprocated back"" McIlroy said. ""I've played so well here over the years.

McIlroy is a winner again after 18 long months. And he picked the perfect place at Quail Hollow. McIlroy closed with a 68 for a one-shot victory in the Wells Fargo Championship.

""There's so much more I want to achieve and so much more I want to do in the game"" McIlroy said. ""But this is as I said it's nice validation that I'm on the right track.""

He had a two-shot lead going to the 18th hole when he put his tee shot in the hazard. After choosing to take a penalty drop hit 8-iron to the green and two-putted for a victory he badly needed.

It was his third victory at Quail Hollow and the 19th of his career on the PGA Tour. Abraham Ancer closed with a 66 and was runner-up.

Pharmaceutical giant MSD which is part of the US group Merck is planning to build a new €140m manufacturing facility linked to an existing plant in Ballydine Co Tipperary.

According to planning documents submitted to Tipperary County Council seen by the Sunday Independent MSD’s proposed project could employ up to 300 construction workers over an estimated 18-month build programme.

MSD which employs around 2700 people here said in the planning application that the proposed facility is required to address a shortage within its worldwide manufacturing capabilities to produce “small volume highly effective drugs”.

“In order to resolve this manufacturing capability deficiency MSD Ireland has initiated a project to build a small-scale single-train facility at Ballydine” MSD said in the document.

“This new pharmaceutical pilot manufacturing facility is intended to assist MSD Ireland (Ballydine) a branch of MSD International Gmbh to meet increasing product demands and to support their pipeline and ultimately help more patients.”

The application is part of MSD Ireland’s requirement for early development small-scale manufacturing facilities for pharmaceutical ingredients and medicines.

The proposed facility is referred to as a “pilot plant” which is for the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

MSD added the pharmaceutical products manufactured from the facility would be those usually used for clinical trials or early medicine release. An example of these types of medicines are those used for chemotherapy products.

According to the plans the new pharmaceutical pilot manufacturing facility would be approximately 3266sqm in size and around 20.75m high. The new facility will be linked to one of its existing manufacturing buildings.

Brian Killen plant manager of MSD Ballydine said the site plays an active role in supporting patients globally.

""The additional expansion is a further endorsement of the highly-skilled team we have working here in Ballydine and the important work that they do” he said.

MSD’s facility at Ballydine is a 33-hectare bulk pharmaceutical manufacturing facility located approximately 12km east of the town of Clonmel.

Its research and commercialisation facility at the site is responsible for developing 20 of MSD’s pipeline products.

MSD has had a presence in the country for over 50 years and has invested approximately €2.2bn in its Irish operations.

Ballydine is one of five MSD sites in Ireland with others based in Carlow Cork Meath and Dublin. Together they manufacture around half of MSD’s top-20 products which are used in 60 countries worldwide. The new facility could provide a small number of highly specialised permanent jobs in addition to the 500 skilled employees currently on site.

Last year MSD announced it would be investing in a separate extension of its Ballydine facility. It also agreed to purchase pharmaceutical company Takeda’s biologics plant in Dunboyne Co Meath with the hope of retaining the site’s 200 employees.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4cHJlc3NwaGFybWEuaW4vYWphbnRhLXBoYXJtYS1saW5lcy11cC1jYXBleC1vZi1ycy0yNTAtY3JvcmVzLWZvci1jdXJyZW50LWZpc2NhbC_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzcGhhcm1hLmluL2FtcC9hamFudGEtcGhhcm1hLWxpbmVzLXVwLWNhcGV4LW9mLXJzLTI1MC1jcm9yZXMtZm9yLWN1cnJlbnQtZmlzY2FsLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ajanta Pharma lines up CAPEX of Rs 250 crores for current fiscal,"Ajanta Pharma has lined up a CAPEX plan of Rs 250 crore for the current fiscal as it looks to expand its corporate office and production facilities said Yogesh Agrawal MD Ajanta Pharma.

The drugmaker operates eight manufacturing facilities in India and Mauritius including two plants that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA).

“During the current year (FY22) we are estimating the CAPEX to be in the vicinity of Rs 250 crore. It will largely go towards maintenance and some new expansions for the corporate office and some key expansions in the facility” Agrawal said in an analyst call.

The company had earmarked a CAPEX plan of Rs 150 crore for the 2019-20 fiscal.

Agrawal noted that Rs 30 crore was invested in the expansion of the corporate office last year and this year it is going to be in the range of Rs 60-80 crore.

Ajanta Pharma currently employs over 7000 people worldwide and its products are sold in over 30 countries including in the US.

When asked about the company’s business plans in the US Agrawal said “Right now we are giving out the guidance of 10 to 12 filings and correspondingly we should be able to fructify and launch in the market.”

He further said “As you know last year it was a very hard lockdown so because of that the R&D was shut for five months and that is the reason we see those reflecting in the abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) filings for the current year or rather last year. But we believe we have made good progress during the last 5-6 months and currently also our R&D is operating if not at a full capacity but at a reasonably good capacity.”

So the company believes that its ANDA filings will pick up in the current year and it would try to come as close to the target of 10 to 12 per year Agrawal said.

On the outlook for the domestic business Rajesh Agrawal Joint Managing Director Ajanta Pharma said the drugmaker is working on multiple opportunities.

For the fiscal year ended March 2021 Ajanta Pharma posted a net profit of Rs 654 crore compared to Rs 468 crore in the previous financial year. The company’s revenue from operations came in at Rs 2890 crore for 2020-21. It was Rs 2588 crore for the previous financial year.",,,,,,

In case you missed it Williamson now one of the N.B.A.’s brightest young stars had his name come up in a lawsuit pitting Brian Bowen a former top college basketball recruit against Adidas. The news was first reported by The Raleigh News & Observer and The Athletic this week.

Before Bowen could play a single college game the N.C.A.A. stripped his eligibility after the F.B.I. began investigating a spate of under-the-table payments in college basketball over the past few years.

The F.B.I. found that an Adidas employee and others had schemed to pay Bowen’s father to steer him to Louisville a school that collects $16 million a year for wearing the sporting goods giant’s gear. Bowen who never played college basketball now toils in the N.B.A.’s developmental league.

What’s that got to do with Williamson you might ask?

Responding to queries from Bowen’s legal team seeking information about payments to college-bound recruits an Adidas lawyer wrote in a court filing last month that the former head of the company’s grass-roots basketball program “may have transferred $3000 per month to the Williamson family for an unspecified period of time.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdmNzLWNyeXB0by1ibG9ja2NoYWluLWludmVzdG1lbnQtYmlsbGlvbnMtc3RhcnR1cHMtZGZpbml0eS1jaGllZi0yMDIxLTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blockchain Internet Will Drive Enormous Growth Dfinity Chief Says,"Mainstream venture capital firms are sitting on ""billions and billions of dollars"" that they're ready to invest in crypto and so-called ""open internet"" startups according to the founder of $2 billion technology nonprofit Dfinity.

Cryptocurrencies including bitcoin Ethereum's ether and even meme token dogecoin have all attracted widespread investment this year with companies including Tesla Jack Dorsey's Square and software firm MicroStrategy all taking up positions in digital assets.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Now venture capital firms are ready to pour billions into startups that are best placed to leverage blockchain technologies. That's according to Dominic Williams the chief scientist and founder of Swiss not-for-profit Dfinity.

""There are billions and billions and billions of dollars in major venture capital funds ready to go to fund crypto and open Internet enterprises"" Williams told Insider.

""If you're an entrepreneur this is your chance this is the next big wave ... Entrepreneurs all over the planet are going to start participating in the tech economy in a way that they've never been able to before.""

Williams was speaking as Dfinity launched the ""Internet Computer"" a new blockchain-based protocol that hopes to tackle the monopolization of the web by a handful of Big Tech companies.

Effectively the Internet Computer aims to allow developers and entrepreneurs to build their technology directly onto the internet instead of relying on cloud-hosting systems provided by the likes of Amazon's AWS Microsoft's Azure and Google's Cloud.

Dfinity has already captured investment from high-profile VCs Polychain Capital and Andreessen Horowitz in a round that valued it at in excess of $2 billion. The nonprofit claims its ""open"" version of the internet will be faster more secure and cheaper than existing services provided by the Big Tech companies.

The Internet Computer which is a culmination of five years of research by a host of top cryptographers has become the world's first blockchain that runs at web speed and with unlimited capacity according to Williams. He also insists the new protocol creates a world where users are ""no longer tracked across internet services"".

""There's a lot of people in the corporate space who invested an awful lot of money in the the old way of doing things"" Williams said.

""People have spent the last 10 years getting the most-valued professional exam from AWS or wherever and are very proud of those qualifications. When you ask them about the Internet Computer they're going to say something like AWS is faster they're not going to be persuaded easily. It will take years.""

But for Williams the business case for porting across to an open internet is very clear. He said the game of traditional IT was that cloud providers tried to ""lock you in"".

""At a business level you know it makes absolute sense for corporations to migrate to the Internet Computer as soon as they can to hightail it out of a traditional IT"" he said.

Williams believes his version of the internet will dramatically reduce the cost of running a business online. As a result it will open up a world of new tech talent beyond San Francisco.

""We all know what an advantage proximity to the network of angels and VCs in Silicon Valley has meant for people creating companies here"" he said.

""Only a tiny fraction of the world's technical talent is in Silicon Valley. It's not so easy (to start a tech company) in Europe. It's damn near impossible from Africa.""

The Dfinity founder insists his technology will enable someone with a ""banged up Chromebook"" in Africa to start a new business.

""That's incredibly exciting it's not only democratizing and spreading opportunity around the world but it's going to just bring in an incredible amount of human intelligence and creativity to bear"" he said.

""This is going to drive growth like no one has ever seen.""

Dfinity has a host of high-profile backers. Polychain Capital is a San Francisco-based hedge fund that was set up in 2016 to invest in blockchain startups. Polychain itself is invested in a by an array of high-profile VCs including early Apple and Google-backer Sequoia Capital. For Andreessen Horowitz its investment into Dfinity represented the first time it had invested into the development of a digital process rather than a company.

The Spanx stayed though.

With in-person meetings and summer weddings creeping back onto her schedule she expects her shapewear collection to grow. “I have to admit: I’m kind of excited about it” the 46-year-old Boston-area finance professional said. “I’m excited about getting dressed up and smoothing out the bumps and lumps and rolls and looking good.”

Shapewear sales which tumbled early in the pandemic as clothing choices became decidedly casual are climbing again as Americans spring for waist-cinchers bodysuits tank tops and slimming panties in hopes of compressing lifting and squeezing their way back into their pre-pandemic forms.

Shapermint an online retailer that pulls in nearly 20 percent of U.S. shapewear sales says its revenue in the category has doubled in the last month driven by demand for high-waisted shaper panties and shorts. Kim Kardashian West’s Skims which hit shelves in late 2019 shortly before the coronavirus crisis disrupted business and social life has sold more than 4 million pieces and grown into a $1.6 billion brand catapulting the reality TV star onto the Forbes billionaires list. And Spanx the industry’s biggest success story is seeing dramatic sales spikes particularly for its maximum-sculpting OnCore line.

“Normal life is slowly returning and as people venture out into the world they are looking for a little hug” said Sara Blakely the company’s founder and chief executive.

The return to such garments fashion psychologists and historians say reflects a larger shift to dressing for others instead of just for ourselves. Yet humans have been manipulating their bodies for thousands of years with statues of Sumerian snake goddesses sheathed in corset-like garments providing one of the earliest examples said Alanna McKnight a historian in Toronto. Later iterations included girdles and corsets made of whalebone iron and leather.

And though modern shapewear — generally seamless with ample stretch — is more comfortable than its predecessors the underlying premise remains the same: to “correct the body” to conform to fashion and society said Denis Bruna a curator at Musée des Arts Décoratifs Paris and author of “Fashioning the Body: An Intimate History of the Silhouette.”

People use shapewear for the “exact same reason they used to wear corsets: Because mainstream fashion does not fit real bodies” said McKnight the historian. “As people prepare to go back into the world it’s easier to slap on a pair of Spanx and suck it in artificially than it is to get in marathon shape.”

Candyce Lindsay a health care auditor in Tempe Ariz. has continued wearing Spanx throughout the pandemic. She’s been hooked on shapewear since giving birth nearly 30 years ago she said and has a drawerful ranging “from cheapies at Walmart to the more expensive ones at Nordstrom.” She’s bought control-top underwear during the pandemic and plans to spring for more mid-thigh shorts as normal life resumes.

“I haven’t abandoned Spanx” the 59-year-old said. “Even though I’m working from home I’m on a lot of calls and I like to look my best period.”

At Spanx the shapewear resurgence comes after it spent much of the last year playing up leggings activewear and pajamas according to Blakely. Consumers still want comfort she said but also want to create the illusion of slimmer waists perkier bottoms and flatter bellies.

“Women haven’t given up shapewear in several centuries” said Sucharita Kodali a retail analyst for Forrester. “Do we really think the pandemic will change things? It’s not like our concept of beauty or a shapely figure have changed in one year.”

The shift has even caught the attention of late-night television hosts: “You know more people are vaccinated when pajama sales go down and Spanx go up” Jimmy Fallon recently quipped.

Spanx which hit the market in 2000 quickly became a household name making it onto Oprah’s “Favorite Things” list and bringing in $4 million in its first year. Sales climbed rapidly — to nearly $250 million by 2012 making Blakely at 41 the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire. (She dropped off Forbes’s billionaires list last year and now has an estimated net worth of about $610 million.)

Today the brand is nearly synonymous with shapewear transforming the once-sleepy category into a $500 million-a-year industry according to market research firm NPD Group. Spanx also has become a cultural touchpoint with celebrities such as Padma Lakshmi Katy Perry and Chrissy Teigen gushing over their undergarments on red carpets and social media.

Shapewear brand MeMoi which sells its products at hundreds of retailers including Macy’s is seeing increased demand for bodysuits control-top fishnet tights and other slimming pieces during what has been “a roller coaster of a year” said Karen Cohen the company’s director of sales and business development.

After a 30 percent drop-off in sales at the beginning of the pandemic she said executives were surprised to find that consumers were snapping up shaping capris and sports bras to wear as leisurewear. The company quickly introduced a line of seamless activewear that also lifts the buttocks and reduces the appearance of back and belly fat and expanded its maternity line which offers extra back support. Demand is rising by about 35 percent in just about every category of shapewear Cohen said.

“As more people go back to their everyday lives maybe they’re carrying a little extra baggage and are looking for more shaping” she said. “When I speak to our national retailers every single one of them says shapewear has been up in the last quarter.”

But a year of comfort-focused dressing analysts say will have a long-term effect on the industry. Many companies say they are having to market their products differently with more of an eye toward everyday wear. Brands are also creating more stand-alone products — such as control-top tank tops and compression leggings that can be worn while lounging around the house.

“Shapewear in the past was presented as something for weddings or special events” said Massimiliano Tirocchi who co-founded Shapermint in 2018. “Now we’re showing it as something you can wear even if you’re working from home.”

[Goodbye jeans. The pandemic is ushering in an era of comfort.]

Sales of wireless bras which tend to be more comfortable than underwire varieties are up threefold from a year ago. Demand for compression camisoles rose sharply during the pandemic because consumers “want to feel confident and in control” he said.

At Skims known for its range of sizes and skin-toned shades shapewear sales have been on a tear since February according to co-founder Jens Grede. Last month the brand opened its first pop-up in Los Angeles where it sold 12000 pieces — or about three per minute — in its first week.

Roy Thomas bought his first Skims waist trainer just before the pandemic to wear when he went clubbing or out with friends. A few months later he bought a second one and has started wearing it just about everywhere: To work the grocery store and out for lunch. Though Spanx and other brands including Under Armour sell men’s compressionwear — traditionally marketed as athletic clothing that helps with muscle recovery — Thomas says he prefers Skims because it offers variety of cuts.

“I use it pretty much any time I leave the house” said Thomas 22 a singer-songwriter in Murrieta Calif. “Now that the world is starting to open I want to invest in more.”

It is claimed that the staff who quit to join Howden Group printed off thousands of pages of commercially sensitive information before they left former employer Guy Carpenter owned by American insurance juggernaut Marsh & McLennan.

Bradley Maltese a former executive at JLT Re led the walkout of 31 staff.

JLT was bought by Marsh McLennan in 2019 in a deal worth $5.6bn (£4bn) with some of its divisions folded into Guy Carpenter.

Guy Carpenter and Marsh Services launched legal action against Mr Maltese alongside Vijay Mavani Molly Wyatt William Abbott and Gayle Scott as well as Howden Insurance Brokers and Howden Group Services Limited according to High Court filings.

It is alleged that four of the defecting group accessed commercially sensitive information in the weeks before they resigned. An interim hearing took place on Apr 30.

Mr Howden oversees one of London’s largest privately-owned insurance empires.

Although the family name is steeped in insurance – his ancestors formed a brokerage to insure the transportation of precious materials from India – he started what is now the Howden Broking with “three staff and a dog” in a small office in the City in 1994.

Howden Group Holdings now employs 8500 people globally and manages insurance premiums of more than £10bn annually.

Guy Carpenter’s history can be traced back to the early 20th century and the southern states of America. Mr Carpenter’s eponymous business initially focused on insuring harvested cotton before he met fellow brokers Henry Marsh and Donald McLennan during a transatlantic crossing in 1923 and merged his business with theirs.

The legal row follows a series of similar wrangles in the US amid a wave of insurance deal making.

Guy Carpenter is on the receiving end of a staff poaching case in the US. The reinsurance division of Willis Towers Watson launched legal action in April after more than 20 employees from its Latin American team resigned to join Guy Carpenter.

Willis Towers Watson agreed to merge with Aon in March 2020. The tie-up worth £21.5bn remains subject to regulatory clearances.

Guy Carpenter and Howden declined to comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the second half of 2020 online gambling stocks were some of the hottest growth stocks on the market. DraftKings (DKNG -1.13%) started a trend when it went public via SPAC merger but Penn National (PENN -1.57%) Rush Street Interactive (RSI -0.48%) Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG) and Gan Ltd (GAN 2.50%) all joined the party by hitting public markets or making deals to expand in online gambling.

The euphoria that drove those gains is quickly being unwound in 2021 partly due to the sell-off in growth stocks and partly because expectations may have gotten too high for online gambling. Here's how you should be looking at the market and the leading stocks in the space.

Casinos are open again

One of the reasons online gambling stocks did so well in 2020 was because physical casinos were closed. People who wanted to gamble needed to do so online and revenue jumped as a result.

We haven't seen a decline in online gambling revenue yet but we are starting to see very bullish signs from physical casino operators. Caesars Entertainment (CZR -0.36%) said this week that weekends are essentially sold out and they are expecting a big rebound in revenue in the second half of the year.

If there are limited discretionary entertainment and gambling dollars to be spent a rise in spending at the casino could translate to less spending online. That's at least one reason online casino stocks have been down recently.

Online gambling is far from profitable

Investors are also starting to see that online gambling companies are far from profitable and likely won't make money for years. It's very expensive to reach new customers resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on sales and marketing and it's far from clear when these companies will report net income.

Let's take DraftKings as a proxy for the industry because it's the biggest publicly traded pure-play company in the U.S. You can see below that revenue is growing quickly but sales general and administrative expenses exceed revenue and losses are accelerating.

This could reverse course as the company gets larger and customer acquisition costs fall but that could be years from now. And with sky-high valuations investors have soured on the long runway these companies may have to profitability.

Waiting in the wings

What I'll be watching in 2021 is how established casino operators react to the online gambling market. Companies like Caesars MGM Resorts (MGM -1.48%) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN -1.52%) have their own online gambling operations and established brands. They will be able to use cash flow from their existing businesses to fund online gambling growth and if they take market share from digital players who are burning cash it could be bad for stocks like DraftKings Rush Street Interactive and Golden Nugget Online.

If stocks continue to fall we could even see these companies poach online gambling stocks to bolt onto their own operations. Las Vegas Sands (LVS 0.11%) has indicated its interest in buying online gambling assets in some form and that could be a possibility if stock prices fall.

Until online gambling companies prove they're sustainable long term I'm going to have a hard time betting on the industry. For now my money is on MGM Resorts translating its industry-leading brands and growing online gambling business into a juggernaut in the industry. And it can wait years for the online gambling market to mature something online-only companies may not have the financial flexibility to do.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2NoYXNld2l0aG9ybi8yMDIxLzA1LzA5L2JpbGwtZ2F0ZXMtZGl2b3JjZS1pbnNpZGUtdGhlLWJpbGxpb24tZG9sbGFyLW1hcnJpYWdlcy1tb3N0LWV4cGVuc2l2ZS1kaXZvcmNlcy1iZXpvcy1kaXZvcmNlLWhhcm9sZC1oYW1tLWNoZWNrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For Richer And Richest: Inside The Billion-Dollar Marriages Open Relationships And Bitter Divorces Of The Forbes 400,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2021/05/09/bill-gates-divorce-inside-the-billion-dollar-marriages-most-expensive-divorces-bezos-divorce-harold-hamm-check/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2NoYXNld2l0aG9ybi8yMDIxLzA1LzA5L2JpbGwtZ2F0ZXMtZGl2b3JjZS1pbnNpZGUtdGhlLWJpbGxpb24tZG9sbGFyLW1hcnJpYWdlcy1tb3N0LWV4cGVuc2l2ZS1kaXZvcmNlcy1iZXpvcy1kaXZvcmNlLWhhcm9sZC1oYW1tLWNoZWNrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hbHBoYXN0cmVldC5jb20vZWFybmluZ3MtY2FsZW5kYXItZm9yLXRoZS13ZWVrLW9mLW1heS0xMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Earnings calendar for the week of May 10,"Stock markets rallied amid mixed cues on the health of the labor market with latest data showing that payrolls grew at a slower-than-expected pace while unemployment claims slipped below the 50K-mark for the first time since the virus outbreak.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added more than 150 points since the last close and reached a new high. The S&P 500 index hovered above the 4200-mark early Friday continuing the uptrend that started mid-week.

In the M&A space the spotlight was on the blockbuster merger between once-rival cannabis firms Tilray and Aphria this week creating what is touted as the world’s biggest pot company. On the heels of spinning off its VMWare subsidiary Dell Technologies agreed to divest its cloud business Boomi to an investor group for about $4 billion.

In the deal-heavy week Okta closed its previously announced buyout of tech firm Auth0 while micro-blogging platform Twitter added Scroll to its fold to enable ad-free news reading.

Meanwhile game developer Zynga clinched a deal to acquire Chartboost a leading mobile programmatic advertising platform for about $250 million. However the highlight of the week was the deal between At Home and private equity firm Hellman & Friedmanand under which the latter would acquire the home décor store for $2.8 billion.

In a week that had a modest beginning in terms of corporate events healthcare behemoths CVS Health and Pfizer reported strong first-quarter results Tuesday morning reflecting the vaccination drive and COVID care activities. In the after-hours Activision Blizzard posted double-digit revenue growth as the game publisher’s user base rose to a record high.

On Wednesday General Motors said its first-quarter earnings more than doubled despite a modest dip in revenues. On the same day Cognizant Technology Uber and PayPal also unveiled their latest quarterly numbers.

On Thursday streaming platform Roku elicited much investor interest by posting a surprise profit for the March quarter amid strong subscription growth. The other important announcements on the relatively busy day were the earnings reports of Beyond Meat and payment services provider Square.

XEL,Xcel Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS94Y2VsLWNlbnRlcnBvaW50LW1ha2UtbWlsbGlvbnMtd2hpbGUtY3VzdG9tZXJzLWdldC1zdHVjay13aXRoLWJpbGxzLWFmdGVyLWZlYnJ1YXJ5LXN0b3JtLzYwMDA1NTMyNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xcel CenterPoint make millions while customers get stuck with bills after February storm,"Despite racking up huge natural gas costs from a historic storm in February CenterPoint Energy and Xcel Energy both posted strong profits during the first quarter.

In fact Xcel's earnings included $27 million in commodity trading profits stemming from the storm. The company said its power-trading operations also saved its customers about $190 million during the big freeze which paralyzed major gas producing regions and sent prices skyrocketing. Gas is a major fuel for both home heating and electricity generation.

CenterPoint tallied $2.2 billion in extra gas costs — including about $500 million in Minnesota — while Xcel incurred $965 million with $215 million from Minnesota. Consumers in Minnesota and other states will likely pay those costs adding potentially hundreds of dollars to their annual gas bill.

That's because Minnesota and most other states treat wholesale gas costs as a pass-through to consumers.

""Because the higher natural gas costs are passed through they did not impact this quarter's results"" CenterPoint CEO David Lesar told analysts in a conference call Thursday. ""We are off to a great start for the year so let's check the utility earnings box as being on track.""

With a pass-through utilities don't mark up the price of gas. Consumers benefit from lower prices and are hurt by higher prices. Usually gas price swings basically even out; but not this time leaving many consumers outraged judging from comments filed with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC). Both CenterPoint and Xcel recently reported first-quarter profits that were comfortably higher than Wall Street forecasts.

Houston-based CenterPoint is Minnesota's largest gas utility; it also has gas and electricity operations in several other states particularly Texas which was blasted by the February storm. Minneapolis-based Xcel is Minnesota's second-largest gas provider and its largest electric utility. Minnesota and Colorado are its primary markets and the latter was hit harder by soaring gas costs. Xcel's Texas operations also were hit.

During the first quarter Xcel's electricity income gains were anchored by an $88 million increase in electricity rates and riders — its main source of earnings as a regulated utility.

But in the first quarter Xcel also booked $27 million in net gains from ""proprietary trading"" according to a federal securities filing. Sizable proprietary trading gains — or losses — are unusual for Xcel.

Like all large utilities Xcel hedges against swings in commodity prices a strategy approved by the PUC and one that is primarily aimed at protecting ratepayers. But Xcel also does some in-house or proprietary trading.

A ""small percentage"" of those in-house trading profits flow to customers Xcel said in a statement. Most gains go to shareholders — though shareholders also bear any losses from proprietary trading the company said. The $27 million trading gain came primarily from Xcel's ""structured origination positions"" in electricity trading markets the company said.

Essentially Xcel had electricity generation capacity beyond its customers' needs thus selling excess power as prices rose during the storm which provided profits while also reducing consumers' bills.

CenterPoint does not do proprietary trading but the practice isn't unique to Xcel. ""There are some utilities that have a small trading business though many have sold them off"" said Michael Doyle a stock analyst at Edward Jones.

The big price run-up is rooted in failures in gas-producing regions such as Texas where temperatures plunged and equipment froze. Supply cratered as demand soared.

But the gas-supply plans of utilities in Minnesota and many other states also came up short during the crisis.

The PUC is investigating the gas-price spike which will cost Minnesota consumers around $800 million. The average CenterPoint customer would get hit the hardest paying $354 for storm-related gas costs more than 50% of a typical annual gas bill. The average Xcel gas customer would pay $270.

By law those costs would be recovered from ratepayers over 12 months starting in September. Both companies have asked the PUC to extend that period to 24 months to ease the sticker shock. CenterPoint initially proposed a finance charge of $40 per month for its average Minnesota customer. The Minnesota Attorney General's Office sharply criticized the charge which CenterPoint said is needed to cover its own gas financing costs.

On April 30 the company told the PUC it had lined up financing and that it would cost $50 million less than initially estimated. CenterPoint said that equates to a $4 per-month financing charge for consumers. Xcel has not proposed a financing fee.

The precise cause of the Medora-area fire is still under investigation by the U.S. Forest Service but emergency responders were quick to blame a low-hanging power line southwest of town in the immediate wake of the event.

It was the highest profile outbreak in what's shaping up to be the worst wildfire season for North Dakota in recent memory. There have been hundreds more fires in 2021 than in all of last year North Dakota Forest Service spokesperson Beth Hill said and over 80000 acres have already burned — nearly six times the land area burned in a typical year.

With extreme widespread drought showing little sign of lifting small catalysts — a lit cigarette sparks from a rail car or a wind-damaged power line — could risk large fires through much of the summer and into the fall.

In the case of power line-sparked fires the risks could be steep for North Dakota's electricity providers. In other Western states power line-initiated fires have become a costly and deadly problem putting big utilities on the losing end in landmark California lawsuits.

“Essentially these utilities have been put on notice” said Yana Valachovic a forest advisor at the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources. Valachovic has observed the massive damages caused by power line-sparked fires in California where the company Pacific Gas & Electric has settled for a total of more than $25 billion in fire deaths and damages over the last few years — an outcome that's precipitated drastic and often expensive changes in the operations of the state's utility companies.

In North Dakota the power line catalyst seems to account for a limited number of the more than 800 wildfires this year and overall the fires have caused no deaths few injuries and little structural harm. Hill said that debris burning equipment use and discarded smoking materials like cigarettes were the leading wildfire causes in 2020 and noted that the Forest Service sees a higher priority in educating North Dakotans on how to travel and spend time outdoors responsibly under these drought conditions.

But while utility-sparked wildfires haven't become a forced issue in North Dakota to this point at least two recent fires that have prompted town evacuations have been linked to power lines and one of the year's biggest outbreaks ignited near a transmission line on a windy day.

Dean Wyckoff chief deputy in the Billings County Sheriff’s Office and Medora Fire Chief Doug Koester both said that early indications pointed to a power line as the cause of the Medora fire. A much smaller late April fire prompted the evacuation of about 150 people in Carpio N.D.  a blaze that Berthold Police Chief Al Schmidt attributed to a downed power line. And in the case of a 20000-acre fire that broke out near the North Dakota-South Dakota border in January  authorities concluded that clashing transmission lines under high winds were one of a few possible causes.

Near Medora Montana Dakota Utilities spokesman Mark Hanson told The Forum that the company has been investigating a low-hanging power line in possible connection to that fire while Verendrye Electric a small rural co-op serving the Minot area said “it’s highly likely” that one of their lines sparked the fire that prompted the evacuation of Carpio.

North Dakota power providers from the small rural electric co-ops to large investor-owned utilities have outlined rigorous steps to gird against these types of incidents.

MDU Xcel Energy Basin Electric and Verendrye each told The Forum that they perform regular inspections of their field equipment and transmission lines. Providers prune trees and undergrowth in accordance with national standards to prevent them from catching fire off of line sparks. Basin Electric reports that it conducts aerial evaluations at least three times yearly and on-the-ground checks twice a year. Xcel which operates over a wide swath of the central United States noted that it uses drones to inspect lines in high-risk areas and is testing new detectors to ensure that a broken line is immediately de-energized. And with drought persisting over much of the state Hanson said that MDU sent additional patrols to the North Dakota Badlands in late April and early May to evaluate the conditions of more than 2200 miles of transmission lines.

The legal liability of utility companies in wildfires can be tricky to pin down especially in the case of extraordinary conditions. Members of the Public Service Commission which regulates utilities have noted that weather events like wind storms may be considered ""force majeure"" for power providers in North Dakota.

Still fire experts say the problem has solutions.

“You can’t be responsible for the wind but you know that wind happens” Valachovic said.

In California and other fire-prone Western states utilities have gone to great lengths to mitigate their risk installing cameras on their poles to monitor any damages as well as weather monitoring systems to allow for a hyper-localized gauge of wind conditions.

These measures can be useful though Valachovic noted that they can come at steep costs that may not be worth it in areas that don't have California-sized risk. In their most extreme and effective tactic California utilities have begun to cut off the flow of electricity to high-risk portions of the grid a step that can leave some areas without power for days.

That might seem like an excessive step in North Dakota where the population is spread thin and the grassland geography is a less potent fuel source than the forests further west. But Michael Wara an attorney and researcher at Stanford Law School who specializes in climate and energy policy argued that a new standard is emerging for utility companies out of the aggressive fire response in California where providers can be held liable more easily than in other states and it may be setting a higher legal bar for utilities in other parts of the country.

“I do think the picture is really changing and it’s changing West-wide” he said. Though the specific responses may differ from region to region Wara noted a utility company can be putting itself on bad footing if it doesn't have a wildfire contingency plan in place. In particular if that plan doesn’t include an evaluation of when it's appropriate to shut off power Wara said ""you’re putting yourself in (legal) danger.”

“The toolkit is not cheap in terms of its impact on customers and its impact on rates but it’s pretty clear what the toolkit is at this point” he said.

When it comes to such drastic measures in North Dakota Hanson said that MDU which provides electricity to much of the western part of the state has not previously looked into cutting power in response to high fire risk but added ""it's an option we would consider under the right circumstances.""

Two local irrigation districts are looking to replace the aging Grand Valley Power hydroelectric plant by the Colorado River near Palisade with a new adjacent plant after deciding against trying to keep the old plant running.

The Orchard Mesa Irrigation District and Grand Valley Water Users Association expect to spend some $10 million not counting cash spending and in-kind contributions to date on what is to be called the Vinelands Power Plant. It will replace a plant that dates to the early 1930s.

The existing plant is owned by the federal Bureau of Reclamation but administered by the two local irrigation entities with Orchard Mesa Irrigation overseeing day-to-day operations and Grand Valley Water Users diverting water for it. The local entities hold a lease of power privilege contract granted by Bureau of Reclamation to operate and maintain the existing plant and will be negotiating a new lease with the agency for the new plant.

Those negotiations take place in public and are scheduled to begin at 1:30 p.m. on Monday in a virtual meeting on a Microsoft Teams platform. Information on joining the meeting may be obtained by contacting Justyn Liff at jliff@usbr.gov or 970-248-0625.

A 30-minute public comment session will follow a scheduled two hours of negotiations and negotiations will continue on another day if needed said Ryan Christianson water management chief for the Bureau of Reclamation’s Western Colorado Area Office.

Mark Harris general manager of the Grand Valley Water Users Association said the hope is to begin construction on the new plant this fall and to have it operating within a year or so afterward.

The irrigation entities had been proceeding on parallel tracks both pursuing continued operation of the existing plant and considering the possibility of replacing it…

Only one of the current plant’s two turbines is being used now. Harris said if the plant were rehabilitated it could produce up to about 3.5 megawatts of power compared to close to 5 megawatts for the new one.

Power from the plant had been sold to Xcel Energy but starting this year it is being sold to Holy Cross Energy based in Glenwood Springs.

Harris said the new plant will be owned 51% by irrigators and 49% by Idaho-based Sorenson Engineering which will build it. Harris said the company has built several power plants for the Uncompahgre Valley Water Users Association.

The Palisade plant will be built on land owned by the Bureau of Reclamation and by Orchard Mesa Irrigation. The project also makes use of fairly senior federal water rights and a federal canal to supply the plant which are also reasons why the lease with the Bureau of Reclamation is required.

For the plant’s owners the project will produce revenues from selling power to Holy Cross. Harris said irrigators also benefit because water that supplies the plant also improves the ability to get irrigation water into a canal at the upstream “roller dam” diversion point at times when the Colorado River is running low.

However the dam has broader benefits as well. Harris said the Bureau of Reclamation holds a water right for the plant of 400 cubic feet per second in the summer and 800 cfs in the winter. That water helps bolster flows immediately downstream in what’s known as the 15-mile reach an area of critical importance for four endangered fish because water levels can fall so low between where irrigation diversions occur for Grand Valley uses and the Gunnison River meets the Colorado River downstream.

Keeping a power plant operating protects the federal water rights and helps in ensuring compliance with Endangered Species Act requirements to protect the fish which Harris said benefits not just local irrigators but numerous other water diverters on the Colorado River in the state including diverters of water to the Eastern Slope.

The plant’s benefit to the fish has helped in securing a lot of partner funding for the new plant from sources such as the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program Bureau of Reclamation Colorado Water Conservation Board and Colorado Water Trust."
