Tom Daley and Jack Laugher are named in a phenomenally strong 12-person diving squad heading to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in less than two months’ time.

After a terrific performance at the FINA Diving World Cup in the Japanese capital last month – a competition that also doubled up as the Olympic test event – Team GB will be represented by a full complement of divers in every single event after the four remaining places were secured.

Laugher reigning Olympic champion in the Men’s 3m Synchro is one of the household names selected and he heads to Japan to defend that crown. He will also target a second Olympic medal in the individual 3m Springboard event after taking silver in that competition five years ago.

Laugher will be joined in the synchro by Rio 2016 bronze medallist Daniel Goodfellow with Edinburgh’s James Heatly the other pick in the 3m individual.

Daley will once again double up in Tokyo contesting both the 10m Platform and 10m Synchro events the latter of which he won Olympic bronze in alongside Goodfellow in Rio. Now diving with Matty Lee in the synchro event the Jane Figueiredo-coached duo will head to Japan full of confidence after winning both the World Cup and European Championship titles last month.

Dive London athlete Daley also famously took bronze in the individual event at London 2012 and will look for further Olympic success in Tokyo – he also has two World titles to his name in that 10m Platform event. Joining him from the high board in the individual contest will be Noah Williams whilst Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix and Lois Toulson will go in the women’s event with Toulson partnered by Eden Cheng in the synchro.

Grace Reid Kat Torrance and Scarlett Mew Jensen round out the diving dozen Reid contesting both the Women’s 3m Springboard and 3m Synchro with Mew Jensen joining her in the former and City of Leeds’ Torrance in the latter.

Of the team heading for Tokyo Team GB Chef de Mission Mark England said: “It is a huge privilege to be able to welcome this talented group of athletes onto Team GB for the Tokyo Olympic Games.

“The performances we’ve consistently seen from these athletes throughout the recent World Cup and European competitions is testament to the hard work and dedication that the whole team has put in throughout what has been a very challenging year. Everyone who supports Team GB will be buoyed by what this team has achieved in recent weeks and will have every confidence that we will see more of these medal-winning performances in Tokyo.

“Congratulations everyone and we look forward to welcoming you to Tokyo in July.”

British Diving Performance Director Alexei Evangulov added:

“This has been the longest Olympic cycle ever however the hardest part of it was the last year – our team exceeded all my expectation in terms of coping with all the challenges we experienced during the pandemic. There were a lot; pool closures isolation quarantine uncertainness competitions postponements you name it. Our divers not only managed to secure their physical and technical shape in this situation but also significantly improved their diving quality.

“All of this plus our coaches and staff’s professionalism allowed us to come up to the homestretch to Tokyo with a great confidence high ambitions and belief.”

A Rutgers study examines the effectiveness of skin barriers that protect clinicians from irritation due to prolonged mask use

A widely available skin barrier used to protect against adhesives and other irritants could potentially help prevent skin damage and breakdown that clinicians suffered as a result of extended mask use during the pandemic a Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School study found.

The student- led study under the guidance of Daniel S. Morrison associate professor of emergency medicine examined the effectiveness of various skin barriers and their impact on the seal integrity of masks. It was one of the largest studies to date to address a condition now commonly referred to as “maskne.”

Throughout the pandemic many clinicians have been wearing and reusing their own personal protective equipment (PPE) like the N95 and 3M half-face mask respirators across multiple shifts due to PPE shortages. As a result clinicians are experiencing skin irritation inflammation breakdown and ulcerations due to protracted use of N95s.

Researchers working on the study published in the May edition of the Journal of Hospital Infection examined whether the placement of a silicone scar sheet (ScarAway) the skin barrier film Cavilon or Tegaderm wound dressing affects 3M half-face mask respirator barrier integrity when compared to no barrier using QNFT. 3M half-mask respirators were chosen because they were already being used by clinicians are reusable and are readily available. Nine clinicians were enrolled including physicians physician assistants nurses and technicians.

All volunteers served as their own control as they were tested using their own 3M half-face mask respirator with and without each skin barrier. Participants were also instructed to apply the supplied dressing on their nasal bridge. No further instruction was given to the participant regarding the placement of the dressing. The study aimed to see the effects of the dressings as they would be commonly placed and used with masks in clinical use.

Results showed that Cavilon a liquid barrier film commonly used to protect the skin against adhesives used around an IV site did not compromise the seal like the silicone scar sheet or Tegaderm.

“These results will inform future research and hospital policies about the safest barriers to prevent skin breakdown without compromising on the safety of our providers and patients in this pandemic” said Morrison.

Investigators recommend that clinicians be appropriately fit tested in a quantitative manner and encourage specialists in the field of dermatology infectious disease and occupational safety to collaborate further to ensure healthcare workers feel safe and comfortable when treating COVID-19 patients and other airborne diseases in the coming months and in future pandemics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaWJ1bmVpbmRpYS5jb20vbmV3cy9zY2hvb2xzL2F0LTgyLWtoYWlyYS1iYWJhamktdHVybnMtbGVnZW5kLWZlZWRpbmctM20tb24tbWFoYXJhc2h0cmEtaGlnaHdheS0yNjA3MjXSAXFodHRwczovL20udHJpYnVuZWluZGlhLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NjaG9vbHMvYXQtODIta2hhaXJhLWJhYmFqaS10dXJucy1sZWdlbmQtZmVlZGluZy0zbS1vbi1tYWhhcmFzaHRyYS1oaWdod2F5LTI2MDcyNQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At 82 Khaira Babaji turns legend feeding 3M on Maharashtra highway,"Yavatmal (Maharashtra) May 30

From the crack of dawn today (Sunday) the sprightly 82-year-old Baba Karnail Singh Khaira has been a busybee shuffling around at his modest 'Guru Ka Langar' near Karanji village on NH-7 here.

With folded hands and a welcoming smile the bespectacled Khaira Babaji warmly ushers in hordes of tired and famished travellers offers them a seat and orders his loyal team to serve them piping hot meals although today is ""very special"".

""It's the 415th anniversary of the martyrdom of Guru Arjan Dev the Fifth Sikh Guru today… As per traditions I offer 'rose sherbet' to all who come to my 'langar' for a month"" the beaming Khaira Babaji said.

When the national lockdown started from March 24 2020 Khaira Babaji's ramshackle 'langar' proved to be a life-saver for millions mostly uprooted migrants or those stranded for weeks away from their homes and kin waiting in long queues for their fill.

At that time the humble 'Guru Ka Langar' was the only decent eatery on a 450-km stretch serving meals - free 24X7 - to anybody who walked in migrants travellers villagers and even mute stray animals.

Now a year later the world-famous 'langar' has started an 'oxygen bank' with 15 cylinders given free to needy Covid-19 patients in the pandemic second wave.

His awe-inspiring story is what legends are made of - and he earned the admiration of millions from celebrities to stars to politicians or commoners and was featured in the TV series ""Bharat Ke Mahaveer"".

Thousands world-over like US-based author Sabina Khan Amardeep Singh of Bengaluru Yavatmal's Kishore Tiwari and Salim Khetani Narendra Narlawar Amritsar Gurudwara Guru Ka Bagh's Baba Satnam Singh and Baba Kirpal Singh Amreek Singh Malli and many more sent big or small donations that kept the 'langar' fires burning without a break.

""In contrast many international TV channels came shot and telecast my films/documentaries and suo moto assured to organise funds for my 'langar' services. They made billions of rupees 'selling me' through sponsors. However I am still waiting for them to fulfil their promises. But Wahe Guru is great.."" said Khaira Babaji looking skywards.

Located in a desolate area the 'langar' is linked with the historic Gurudwara Bhagod Sahib in Wai around 11 kms away in a dense jungle visited mostly by Sikhs.

It was here that the 10th Sikh Guru Guru Gobind Singh stayed in 1705 while en route to Nanded some 250 km away where he was assassinated on October 7 1708.

Nearly 125 years later it bloomed as the world-famous 'Gurudwara Takht Hazuri Sahib Sachkhand' (Nanded) one of the most revered Five Takhts in Sikhism.

""Gurudwara Bhagod Sahib is barely accessible so in 1988 we started this 'langar' branch on the highway. I was assigned to manage it with the blessings of Nanded Gurudwara Sahib's Baba Narinder Singhji and Baba Balwinder Singhji"" recalls Khaira Baba.

The pandemic Lockdown 2.0 was a different experience for him he chuckled. ""My photos and phone numbers are all over on social media… Now people call me up hours before and request me to keep food ready for big or small groups 50 100 or 500 people! This is Guru Nanak's blessings..!"" The 'langar' serves breakfast of tea with hard bread or biscuits meals comprising rice rotis dal vegetables biryani with daily menu change providing soap and borewell water for bathing to the visitors.

Born in Meerut (Uttar Pradesh) the young Karnail left home at 11 to answer ""a mysterious call for service to humankind"" later travelled all over India lived in countries of the Middle-East and Europe for nearly 10 years organizing funds for Gurudwara services.

""Though semi-literate I speak fluent English Hindi Punjabi Arabic Dutch German and of course Marathi"" Khaira Baba said with pride.

Attributing his daily lonesome grind in the dust and blazing sun as 'marzi (desire) of Wahe Guru' his sole possessions are 3 sets of clothes and travelling around in the three service vehicles donated by devotees to the 'langar'. He drove down to run 'langars' outside Delhi during the ongoing farmers agitation.

Khaira Babaji calculated the number of persons fed based on the disposable plates count as 3 million plus for the past 15 months 2 million in the initial 75 days rest in the last 12 months (June 1 2020-May 31 2021) besides over 600000 'take-away parcels' and still counting… The 'Guru ka langar' has kept two donation boxes outside in which people drop coins/notes but the collection is never counted and the money ploughed back into public service.

Guest columnist

Elizabeth Abbott is a writer and lawyer living in Pawtucket.

U.S. troops are finally leaving Afghanistan after 20 years a decision recently announced by President Biden. It’s time to end the “forever war” Biden said a conflict responsible for at least 2448 American deaths and the wounding of 20772 soldiers.

Bring the troops home. Heck who doesn’t like that idea? Do we really need to shed more American blood in Afghanistan a dusty tumultuous country that has historically resented foreigners? Why spend the money? Why spend the time?

“What’s the downside of leaving?” I imagine one of the Washington D.C. decision makers asking.

I picture them sitting around a highly polished table coolly assessing the pros and cons of pulling the plug on American military support a dicey proposition given a resurgence of Taliban violence right now. Maybe there’s a woman or two in this group of high-level officials but in my mind it’s predominately male. And I’m probably right.

“Women might lose some of the freedoms they have won in the last 20 years” one answers.

“How bad could it get?”

“Unclear.”

Oh really? Unless you’ve had a bag over your head for the last two decades you should have a pretty good idea of what will happen once the United States and its NATO allies depart. You remember the Taliban don’t you? They’re the guys who think women shouldn’t show their faces in public. When they controlled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 girls weren’t allowed to go to school and women weren’t allowed to work. Women could also be stoned or flogged for so-called morals offenses male-defined of course.

A newly declassified U.S. intelligence report essentially predicts that women’s rights will slide without American military support whether the Taliban regains control or not. But in explaining his decision Biden said the U.S. had met its objective of rooting out Al Qaeda’s terrorist training camps which helped to spawn the 9/11 attacks on this country. He vowed American troops would depart by Sept. 11 of this year 20 years to the day the twin towers collapsed offering a tidy almost Hollywood-like ending to a conflict that has been anything but.

The gains Afghan women have made in the last 20 years — such as the right to hold elected office go to school and work outside the home — received one line in Biden’s April 14 speech a vague pledge to support their rights with “significant” humanitarian and development assistance. So too Afghanistan’s current president Ashaf Ghani has vowed to protect the progress made by women at the same time his government is negotiating with the Taliban for an end to their protracted war.

But the Taliban and other fundamentalist creeps in Afghanistan like the Afghan branch of ISIS have never disguised their feelings about women and girls. The younger generation claim to be more open-minded and in some places they control have even allowed girls to go to school — until puberty that is. But in general their actions belie their words. In May 2020 gunmen attacked a maternity ward in Kabul killing 24 people among them five women in labor 10 who had recently given birth and three children.

No group claimed responsibility.

Then just to make their intentions perfectly clear bombs exploded earlier this month at a girls’ high school killing at least 50 people many of them poor teenage girls. As the New York Times reported “The scale of the killing and the innocence of the victims seemed further unnerving proof of the country’s violent unraveling as the Taliban make daily gains …”

So back to the decision makers in Washington: No doubt they and President Biden had a difficult decision to make. But they shouldn’t pretend they don’t know whom they’re sacrificing in their determination to get out of Afghanistan. The victims will be innocent lambs. Girls again. When will it end?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vYmlnLWJyb3RoZXItZXhlcmNpc2UtY2hyaXN0bWFzLWFiYm90dC1hZGRpY3Rpb24tbWVtcGhpcy1nYXJyZXR0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big Brother: How Exercise Helped Christmas Abbott Overcome Addiction,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vYmlnLWJyb3RoZXItZXhlcmNpc2UtY2hyaXN0bWFzLWFiYm90dC1hZGRpY3Rpb24tbWVtcGhpcy1nYXJyZXR0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFscmV2aWV3LmNvbS9uZXdzL3RleGFzLWdvdmVybm9yLWFiYm90dC1iaWRlbnMtb3Blbi1ib3JkZXItcG9saWNpZXMtcmVzcG9uc2libGUtZm9yLWZlbnRhbnlsLWNyaXNpcy_SAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXRpb25hbHJldmlldy5jb20vbmV3cy90ZXhhcy1nb3Zlcm5vci1hYmJvdHQtYmlkZW5zLW9wZW4tYm9yZGVyLXBvbGljaWVzLXJlc3BvbnNpYmxlLWZvci1mZW50YW55bC1jcmlzaXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Governor Abbott: ‘Biden’s Open-Border Policies’ Responsible for Fentanyl Crisis,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vc29hcHMuc2hla25vd3MuY29tL3RoZS15b3VuZy1hbmQtdGhlLXJlc3RsZXNzL25ld3MvNjAwODA2L3lvdW5nLXJlc3RsZXNzLWphY2stYWJib3R0LWZhbGwtZm9yLXRhcmEtbG9ja2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Young & Restless' Jack Abbott Fall for Tara Locke?,"Credit: Howard Wise/JPI

We can totally see Jack falling for this woman and repeating old patterns.

Call us crazy but sometimes when two characters share scenes or are thrown into a situation together you just know it’s the perfect set-up for romance to blossom. Whether it’s one-sided opportunistic or genuine is beside the point… if the characters involved are throwing that vibe it’s a no-brainer. Young & Restless viewers astutely noticed this very thing when Jack moved Tara into the Abbott mansion…

SOAPS message board poster Canukfan mused “When I saw Jack and Tara together I thought they would make a great pairing… Jack going against Locke in a battle would be good also.” While a few responders found the idea a bit of a turn-off Dawn888 chimed in “I loved their chemistry together so I’d be fine with it. Smilin’ Jack is back.” Ellen61 was also on board: “I agree. They looked good together. I can definitely see it going this way” but wasn’t without concerns and added “Right now I do not trust Tara at all.”

Of course it would be beyond complicated given that Tara had an affair with Jack’s son who may or may not have fathered a child with her (DNA paternity test confirmation can never be trusted on a soap opera) but it would be far from the first time a woman became involved with more than one man from the same family on Young & Restless. It’s practically business as usual.

More importantly we can totally see Jack falling for her. He’s already taken on somewhat of a protective role where Harrison and Tara are concerned and he’s notoriously prone to falling for women he’s in close proximity with as well as having a particular knack for going head over heels for those who are shifty or who might have an agenda.

No one has Tara figured out quite yet but there’s every chance she’s up to something and if she has an agenda it may very well — at least in part — have to do with snagging an Abbott man. One good way to accomplish that would be to flatter and flirt with Jack whilst under his roof — especially if she realizes can’t make in-roads with Kyle.

While viewers were having trouble imaging Kyle and Tara as lovers with Jack there’s no issue; she’s more his speed and the way their scenes have played so far it’s no stretch at all to imagine them spending more and more time together and eventually becoming involved.

Of course if Tara has her sights set on Kyle the Jack angle may never play out. Or if it turns out down the road that she changed the paternity results and is yet another manipulator it could mean more heartbreak for Jack… but at least there might be some much-needed romance and drama along the way.

Can you imagine Jack falling for Tara? Let us know in the comment section but first take a look back at Peter Bergman as Jack over the years in the photo gallery below.

According to Kumar the pandemic has brought in a tectonic shit in online education and higher education is witnessing a tremendous surge across the globe.

Co-founded by entrepreneur Ronnie Screwvala Kumar and Phalgun Kompalli in 2015 upGrad has achieved an annual revenue run rate (ARR) of $165 million and maintains a strong network of over 20 national and international universities.

What sets it apart from other online players is ‘deep personalisation’ where counsellors virtually handhold each learner for the entire duration of course.

Each student over a year goes through more than 50 one-on-one coaching sessions from their future hiring managers/business leaders and get personalised job recommendations based on their experience aptitude and personal ambition.

As a result the course completion rate is 80 per cent which is unprecedented in online education worldwide according to the company.

“We are seeking collaborations with more Indian higher education institutes to widen our reach and benefit more and more learners in the country” said Kumar an IIT-Delhi alumnus who has over 10 years of experience in education as an investor and an advisor.

Earlier this week upGrad announced to acquire video-enabled learning solutions provider Impartus committing over Rs 150 crore towards the buyout as well as to boost its growth and cement its foothold in college education.

Impartus now a 100 per cent subsidiary of upGrad has been rebranded as ‘upGrad Campus’.

‘upGrad Campus’ will have two business verticals. While under B2C vertical it will offer several job-oriented courses under the B2B vertical these offerings will be to HigherEd Institutions (HEI).

The move will enable upGrad to add 50000 paid learners in the very first year of the acquisition according to Kumar.

In the pandemic-hit 2020 more than 450 companies including ZS Associates PayTM Gartner Flipkart (Walmart-acquired) Accenture and E&Y hired more than 1200 learners from the upGrad talent pool.

In 2021 till March jointly with the recruitment and staffing solutions firm Rekrut India which is now a 100 per cent subsidiary of upGrad the company has enabled over 2500 career transitions with a highest salary hike of 400 per cent (a package of Rs 73 lakh per annum).

“We don’t offer short-term one-month-odd courses. We offer extensive courses and extend solid knowledge that takes time and a lot of hours. We believe that the knowledge that we offer our users can use it to his/her advantage in real life” Kumar said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiHWh0dHBzOi8vY2lvYWZyaWNhLmNvLzU1MTI4LTIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MultiChoice Kenya Wins Big AT KUZA Awards 2021,"A recent social-economic study by Accenture revealed MultiChoice Kenya has contributed over Kshs57.3 billion in socio-economic value to the country’s economy from 2015 to 2019.

Multichoice Kenya walked away with five coveted awards at the fourth edition of the Kuza Awards held recently by the Communication Authority(CA).

The 2021 edition brought together dozens of broadcasters from the country’s news and entertainment industry in a gala afternoon that celebrated the best in technological innovation during a difficult operating period.

Multichoice Kenya’s mass-market video entertainment brand GOtv clinched two critical compliance awards the Compliance Award for Subscription Broadcasting Service Provider and also emerged overall winner in the compliance award for Broadcast Signal Distributor.

The Compliance Award recognised service providers that operated within licensing requirements complied with routine regulatory inspections and programming code.

The award also recognised broadcasters with the most effective complaints handling procedures as well as those who managed to achieve a local content quota of 40 per cent.

A recent social-economic study by consultancy firm Accenture revealed MultiChoice Kenya has contributed over Kshs57.3 billion in socio-economic value to the country’s economy from 2015 to 2019.

This included over Sh13.8 billion in infrastructure investment in local programming infrastructure as well local content development. Multichoice invested another Kshs3.3 billion in local content production acquisition and commission within the same period with another Sh120million spent on the local football league via Supersport.

Multichoice Kenya was also crowned the overall winner of the Subscription Broadcasting Services Award under the local content category beating Startimes and Viusasa in the coveted category. This win is particularly critical coming at such a time when we are celebrating Kenya’s stars and top Kenyan shows brought to life by Maisha Magic East as well as Maisha Magic Plus” said MultiChoice Kenya Managing Director Nancy Matimu.

This year’s awards came on the back of the COVID-19 pandemic that disrupted most businesses forcing many to innovate and adapt to maintain operations and market shares.

“This event is taking place amidst the COVID-19 pandemic that has not only had a serious impact on the sector but also brought to the fore the fundamental role of ICTs” said CA Acting Director-General Mercy Wanjau while unveiling the winners.

“Research has established that 95 per cent of the Kenyan population has a high awareness about the pandemic largely through information disseminated through radio and TV” she said.

Multichoice further dominated the People’s Choice Category beating Startimes and Citizen TV’s Viusasa. Multichoice Kenya’s GOtv also won the inaugural overall People’s Choice Award for Favourite Pay TV service with DStv emerging first runners up.

The people’s choice awards is a new category that was introduced to give audiences a voice in the awards by voting for their favourite broadcasters.

While speaking on behalf of Kenya’s ICT Minister ICT Permanent Secretary Esther Koimett said the crisis had also highlighted the need for innovation among service providers to remain relevant as a vehicle for information and entertainment.

“I urge broadcasters to embrace innovation in order to remain competitive and relevant in today’s dynamic broadcasting environment” she said.

Mrs. Wanjau also indicated that starting July this year the Authority will only issue compliance certificates to broadcasters who meet all the licence conditions and other regulatory requirements.

‘‘One of the key elements that we shall be evaluating for eligibility for annual compliance certificate is compliance with copyright obligations in accordance with their license conditions’’ she said.

She challenged the media to utilize their platform to shape positive perceptions in how the Kenyan narrative is portrayed and to leverage the combined synergies of the industry and audiences towards the growth of a vibrant competitive and resilient broadcasting industry in Kenya.

This year’s KUZA Awards were themed Preserving our Cultural Heritage through Broadcasting: Kenya a Heritage of Splendour."

""The attack idea exploits the flexibility of PDF certification which allows signing or adding annotations to certified documents under different permission levels"" said researchers from Ruhr-University Bochum who have systematically analyzed the security of the PDF specification over the years.

The findings were presented at the 42nd IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (IEEE S&P 2021) held this week.

The two attacks — dubbed Evil Annotation and Sneaky Signature attacks — hinge on manipulating the PDF certification process by exploiting flaws in the specification that governs the implementation of digital signatures (aka approval signature) and its more flexible variant called certification signatures.

Certification signatures also allow different subsets of modifications on the PDF document based on the permission level set by the certifier including the ability to write text to specific form fields provide annotations or even add multiple signatures.

The Evil Annotation Attack (EAA) works by modifying a certiﬁed document that's provisioned to insert annotations to include an annotation containing malicious code which is then sent to the victim. On the other hand the idea behind the Sneaky Signature attack (SSA) is to manipulate the appearance by adding overlaying signature elements to a document that allows filling out form fields.

""By inserting a signature field the signer can define the exact position of the field and additionally its appearance and content the researchers said. ""This flexibility is necessary since each new signature could contain the signer's information. The information can be a graphic a text or a combination of both. Nevertheless the attacker can misuse the flexibility to stealthily manipulate the document and insert new content.""

In a hypothetical attack scenario detailed by the academics a certifier creates a certified contract with sensitive information while enabling the option to add further signatures to the PDF contract. By taking advantage of these permissions an attacker can modify the contents of the document say to display an International Bank Account Number (IBAN) under their control and fraudulently transfer funds as the victim unable to detect the manipulation accepts the tampered contract.

15 of 26 PDF applications evaluated by the researchers counting Adobe Acrobat Reader (CVE-2021-28545 and CVE-2021-28546) Foxit Reader (CVE-2020-35931) and Nitro Pro were found vulnerable to the EAA attack enabling an attacker to change the visible content in the document. Soda PDF Desktop PDF Architect and six other applications were identified as susceptible to SSA attacks.

More troublingly the study revealed that it's possible to execute high-privileged JavaScript code — e.g. redirect the user to a malicious website — in Adobe Acrobat Pro and Reader by sneaking such code via EAA and SSA as an incremental update to the certified document. The weakness (CVE-2020-24432) was addressed by Adobe as part of its Patch Tuesday update for November 2020.

To fend off such attacks the researchers recommend prohibiting FreeText Stamp and Redact annotations as well as ensuring that signature fields are set up at defined locations in the PDF document prior to certification alongside penalizing any subsequent addition of signature fields with an invalid certification status. The researchers have also created a Python-based utility called PDF-Detector which parses certified documents to highlight any suspicious elements found in the PDF document.

""Although neither EAA nor SSA can change the content itself – it always remains in the PDF – annotations and signature fields can be used as an overlay to add new content"" the researchers said. ""Victims opening the PDF are unable to distinguish these additions from regular content. And even worse: annotations can embed high privileged JavaScript code that is allowed to be added to certain certified documents.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYmVya3NoaXJlZWRnZS5jb20vc2hlbGJ1cm5lLWZhbGxzLW1hc3NhY2h1c2V0dHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Day Trip: Shelburne Falls Massachusetts,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='theberkshireedge.com', port=443): Read timed out.

It’s a bit like the ‘Portrait Mode’ on your smartphone but with more control. Photoshop expert Martin Evening shows how to get the best results.

The new Depth Map filter is available from the Neural Filters menu in Photoshop where the filter’s controls can be used to add a blur depth effect to an image. Wherever you click on the preview will be the point of sharpest focus. Photoshop then creates a pseudo depth map from a regular 2D image and uses this to apply progressive degrees of blur towards the distance.

The sliders let you set the amount of blur and depth of field range as well as apply other effects such as haze colour-shifts and brightness. The actual processing is carried out in the cloud. Therefore the responsiveness of the sliders is slow but once you have finished adjusting the settings the filter can be quickly applied.

The problem I have experienced working with the Depth Blur filter is that the subject edges often bleed into the background producing soft halo effects. And in this instance lightening the model’s dress. If you don’t want your photos looking like a conference-call screengrab it is possible to work around this.

Advanced Photoshop users should check the ‘Output depth map only’ option. This adds a greyscale depth map layer. Convert this to a mask channel and use your painting and pen path skills to edit the mask. Reapply the Depth blur as a regular output layer. Apply the edited mask as a layer mask to this layer and continue to edit. I have found that by spending time refining the filter output it is possible to obtain more realistic results.

The new tool in action: step-by-step

Blurring the background focus

The original raw image was opened via Camera Raw where I went to the Basic panel.

I then applied some basic tone and colour adjustments to add more saturation and lighten the image while preserving the highlight detail in the dress.

Over to Photoshop

I then opened the Camera Raw-edited image in Photoshop. I then went to the Filter menu and chose Neural Filters. In the filter dialog I enabled the Depth Blur filter with the default Blur Strength and Focal Range settings.

Warm things up

With the Neural Filters dialog still open I further modified the settings by dragging the Warmth slider to the left to add a cooler colour balance. I also added a brighter luminance to the Depth Blur filter effect.

Skin smoothing

Click OK to apply the Depth Blur effect.

After that I chose Neural Filters again from the Filter menu. This time I enabled the Skin Smoothing filter and applied a 55 Blur. This filter effect is applied solely to detected faces in the image.

And here is the final image.

About Neural Filters

The Depth Blur feature is one of many Neural Filters that have been added to Photoshop. These all rely on cloud-based computing to analyse and apply the desired effects. Current filters include Skin Smoothing JPEG Artefact removal and Style Transfer. But there are also a number of beta filters available such as the Depth Blur.

As these filters are in beta development they are still being refined. Therefore some failings such as the edge bleed blur may hopefully be corrected by the time it is officially added as a Neural filter. For those Adobe customers willing to take part in the participation program you can vote using the ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ buttons when processing an image and this can help train the AI machine learning to achieve better results.

'Accelerousal' likely an 'innate' behavior for edgy drivers -,"HOUSTON — Does a drive in your car leave you in a worse mood than when you started the trip? Is road rage something you often find yourself struggling to hold back? If so a new study finds you may be dealing with a case of “accelerousal.”

That’s the main finding by researchers at the University of Houston who say some drivers have no problem staying calm cool and collected behind the wheel — regardless of traffic reckless drivers or other road nuisances. On the other hand other motorists can’t help but feel like they’re going to explode.

“We call the phenomenon ‘accelerousal.’ Arousal being a psychology term that describes stress. Accelarousal is what we identify as stress provoked by acceleration events even small ones” explains study leader and UH Professor Ioannis Pavlidis in a university release.

“It may be partly due to genetic predisposition” he adds. “It was a very consistent behavior which means in all likelihood this is an innate human characteristic.”

Feelings of road rage monitored in drivers

Along with colleagues from Texas A&M’s Transportation Institute study authors investigated how various drivers reacted to common acceleration speed and steering events taking place on a “carefully monitored itinerary.”

“Thanks to our work we now have an understanding of accelerousal a phobia that was hidden in plain sight” says Tung Huynh a research assistant on the project.

In all 11 drivers took part in the study. Study authors monitored each person closely during a series of half-hour drives along the same route in the same Toyota Sienna minivan. As participants drove researchers looked for signs of instantaneous physiological stress.

The team measured stress using thermal imaging that specially targeted drivers’ levels of perinasal perspiration an involuntary facial response which indicates fight-or-flight reactions. Meanwhile the internal computer within the car also tracked the vehicle’s acceleration speed brake force and steering.

Accelerousal takes a toll on the body

Following these drives researchers discovered that about half of the drivers showed “peaked stress” during moments of “commonplace acceleration” like stopping at a red light for example. The other drivers stayed clam while driving.

“This has all the characteristics of long-term stressor with all the health and other implications that this may entail” Pavlidis notes.

“The differences were significant with ‘accelaroused’ participants logging nearly 50% more stress than non-accelaroused ones” he continues. “Moreover psychometric measurements taken through a standardized questionnaire given to every volunteer at the end of the drive revealed that acceleroused drivers felt more overloaded.”

Drivers who showed signs of stress were much more exhausted after finishing than the others. Apparently it’s hard work getting upset.

“This was a clear indication that accelerousal was taking a toll on drivers and that the drivers were not consciously aware of that” Pavlidis adds.

Study authors say their findings warrant much more research in the future. Better understanding how the human body reacts to the experience of driving may help save lives in the future — both on and off the road.

“For instance delivery drivers which is an expanding class in the current gig economy are exposed to stop-and-go events all the time. Therefore delivery drivers who experience accelerousal – and for now are unaware – could have a way to detect this condition in themselves and account for its long-term stress effects” Plavdis concludes.

The study appears in the journal Association for Computing Machinery."

The 45-year-old Full House star recently posted two photos of herself lounging near a beach while wearing a multi-colored striped sweater and blue bikini bottoms. Candace has her hair in perfect beach waves and her makeup minimal.

""Sunday vibes"" Candace captioned one photo while the other read ""Taking on Tuesday with a beach day mindset."" She also noted that the sweater she is wearing in the photos is from her clothing line with QVC Candace Cameron Bure Clothing.

Both celebrity friends and fans couldn't get enough of the pics as each one has a ton of comments and likes. ""Hot mama!"" fellow Hallmark star Danica McKellar wrote. ""Not enough 🔥 emojis possible"" said journalist Paula Farris. ""Yasss!!!! Ya look fabulous"" commented Olympia Priscilla Frederick.

And while we're sure Candace enjoyed her time on the beach we know she's been super busy lately. In January she published another children's book Candace's Playful Puppy she's been promoting her clothing line (the second collection just dropped!) on QVC her new movie Aurora Teagarden: How to Con a Con is airing May 28 on Hallmark Movies and Mysteries and she recently celebrated her youngest son's graduation from high school.

Actually with all of this going on it sounds like Candace needs a beach vacation ASAP!

This year the conference will be virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic but this will not prevent the company from unleashing news about its software as well as releasing new products. That’s right the traditional fair centered on developers is now a good place for the Cupertino-based firm to unleash new products. According to rumors the company will showcase the brand new Apple Silicon during the event. It will reveal new products including a new redesigned Mac Pro featuring its latest ARM64 chip. Today high-quality stunning renders have emerged showing what we can expect from the new computer.

One of the direct benefits of using an ARM platform is the fact that this architecture allows Apple to reduce the size of computers. For that reason the new Mac Pro is expected to “shrink” significantly and take benefit from the new architecture. However the performance will be much better than the top versions that arrived with Intel processors some of which are still available for purchase. The MacBook Pro started a new precedent for Apple computers after the very successful reception of the Apple M1. The Mac Pro may another ground-breaking solution and as usual Apple wants to deliver performance inside of a very refined package.

The concept renders shows a new MacBook Pro that looks anything but a traditional computer. Of course we’re already used to the unconventional design language established by the Mac Pro lineup. The device has two metallic handles in the top. It also brings a power button that seems to be capacitive. Further there are two Thunderbolt 3 USB Type-C ports. Lastly the top also has a LED and a slide-out handle to remove the aluminum chassis.

According to the tipster Jon Prosser the redesigned Mac Pro will be similar to the size of three Mac mini computers stacked o each other. This theory has been used by svetapple. sk to create a new concept that resembles a simple cube with rounded edges. Since this is a MacBook Pro the creators of the image added a few iconic design elements. Notable elements the handles and the ventilation grill that resembles a cheese grater. Of course it also has a functional side. For instance if the temperature inside the aluminum chassis rises significantly the ventilation grill can drain it outwards.

Mac Pro (2021) concept shows the ideal connectivity

The concept renders reveal a bunch of connectors in the rear part of the structure. It’s the best scenario of connectivity but of course we can’t say for sure if this will be on par with the final product. The MacBook with just a single USB-C port tells us a sad story about connectivity. Anyway this is a Mac Pro so let’s wait for the best. The new product offers 6 x USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports 4x USB-A port 2x HDMI 2x Ethernet and 1 MagSafe charging port.

The concept is firmed by four elegant lenses and shares several characteristic elements with the classic Mac Pro 2019. At first glance it is clear which computer it is referring to. As far as the specifications are concerned leaker Mark Gurman revealed some tidbits about the new product recently.

As per the rumors Apple’s new computer will be truly a powerhouse

According to him the redesigned Mac Pro will come in 20 or 40 computing core variations. They will be made up of 16 high-performance or 32 high-performance cores and four or eight high-efficiency cores. The chip will also include either 64 core or 128 core options for graphics. The computing core counts top the 28 core maximum offered by today’s Intel Mac Pro chips. The higher-end graphics chips will replace parts now made by Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

We expect more details and leaks to appear in the coming days ahead of Apple WWDC 2021 so stay tuned. Anyway what you think of a product with this design? It looks very elegant and different in my humble opinion what you think about it?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9tZWdhbi1mb3gtbWFkZS1zdXJwcmlzZS1hcHBlYXJhbmNlLTE3MjY1MDkyMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Megan Fox Made a Surprise Appearance at Machine Gun Kelly's Concert in a Bra Top,"Another day another outing for Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly.

During his performance of the song ""I Think I'm OKAY"" Kelly introduced Fox — dressed in a black bra top with long sleeves high-waisted jeans and platform heels — to the audience as his ""girlfriend.""

She wore her long hair down in loose waves and parted down the middle.

In a video shared to Twitter Megan held MGK's hand and kissed his shoulder before running off when he turned the microphone towards her to sing.

Earlier this week Kelly revealed the exact date Fox told him ""I love you."" On Tuesday he tweeted: ""She said 'I love you' one year ago today."" Fox also hasn't been shy about her and Kelly's connection. Back in November she told Nylon that ""loving him is like being in love with a tsunami or a forest fire.""

Unruly twins Phil and Lil's mother Betty DeVille has been rewritten as openly gay in the new episodes.

Dead to Me actress Natalie Morales is taking over the role from Kath Soucie who was the original voice of Betty and said the character is now a really good example for young queer people who may not have any other characters like her on television to look up to.

""Anyone who watched the original show may have had an inkling Betty was a member of the alphabet mafia"" Morales said in a statement.

""Betty is a single mom with her own business who has twins and still has time to hang out with her friends and her community and I think it's just so great because examples of living your life happily and healthily as an out queer person is just such a beacon for young queer people who may not have examples of that.""

""And yeah Betty is a fictional cartoon but even cartoons were hugely influential for me as a kid and if I'd been watching Rugrats and seen Betty casually talking about her ex-girlfriend I think at least a part of me would have felt like things might be okay in the future.""

Warburg-Pincus is a multinational corporation that in 2005 had investment holdings in 120 companies in North and South America Asia and Europe in 2005 according to Hoover’s online.

Poseidon’s subsidiary role then as now was to financialize a portion of publicly owned water infrastructure in Orange County for the benefit of Poseidon and the project’s investors through “public-private partnerships” (PPPs).

At the same time Poseidon was on a similar track in Carlsbad in San Diego County a story that I will tell more about as Poseidon Town Through the Wormhole unravels.

Poseidon’s Orange County mission was to build a $1.4 billion (in today’s dollars) ocean desalination plant on top of an earthquake fault co-located with a power plant that sits next to the Ascon Landfill a toxic waste dump in an upper middle-class neighborhood in Huntington Beach in the middle of a predicted climate-change induced flood zone.

To maximize efficiency and profits Poseidon chose to co-locate with the AES power plant located on Newland Ave. and Beach Blvd. in order to use its seawater-intake cooling system to suck up about 100 million gallons of seawater for conversion to 50 million gallons of drinking water per day.

That mission remains unfulfilled but ongoing today nearly 20 years later.

Poseidon Resources probably began taking its project proposal to officials of the City of Huntington Beach the Orange County Water District (OCWD) and the Municipal Water District of Orange County (MWDOC) sometime in 2001 or earlier about when Poseidon began preliminary studies of the project site…

The change to Airbnb’s cancellations and refunds policy introduced in October last year means Covid is no longer considered an extenuating circumstance.

Guests affected by pandemic-related transportation disruptions and border closures will be at the mercy of individual hosts’ cancellation policies.

“After the declaration of Covid-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization the extenuating circumstances policy no longer applies because Covid-19 and its consequences are no longer unforeseen or unexpected” Airbnb says on its website.

To Elizabeth Packett who was planning to come to Sydney to see the popular theatre production Hamilton it meant she was completely dependent on her host.

“It’s the luck of the draw whether you get a host who’s compassionate about that kind of thing or not. It would be great if Airbnb would back that up and you’d have that security but also I guess that means you really have to read the fine print” Packett said.

“In a way I kind of get their point in that every time we make travel plans now we have to be prepared that it might fall apart.”

Packett said the safety net provided by a more supportive Airbnb policy would encourage more people to book using the platform.

“It would be really helpful. I sort of equate it to when you want to return something you’ve bought online they should make that process as easy as possible.”

“I just think in general people are going to book more if they have that certainty that should something like this come up at the last minute they’re not going to be messed around.”

Packett luckily had an understanding host and was able to exchange dates to November but she never got a firm answer on if she could have gotten a refund.

“We would have liked a refund we were just over it and didn’t want to risk coming again. But we’ve just rebooked everything for November it was easier than getting a refund.”

Derek Nolan Airbnb’s head of public policy for Australia and New Zealand said most hosts do offer flexible cancellation policies.

“For our guest community hosts recognise that they are seeking flexibility at these uncertain times and now almost two-thirds of active listings offer a moderate or flexible cancellation policy.”

“And with our flexible cancellation policy search filter guests search for listings that offer free cancellation until 24 hours before check-in avoiding any strict cancellation policy listings from their search results entirely. Guests can view their host’s cancellation policy prior to booking.

“We want to thank our community for continuing to do their part to combat Covid-19. Our message has been consistent and clear: everyone must closely follow government advice and strictly adhere to the rules.”

Jodi Bird a travel expert at consumer advocacy group Choice said the change in policy was within the company’s “rights”.

“It would be a positive development for the travel industry if a high-profile booking site like Airbnb set a higher standard for refunds but Airbnb are within their rights not to extend their extenuating circumstances policy to unforeseeable travel bans.

“When people are booking travel on Airbnb we recommend they check the ‘Only show stays that offer free cancellation’ filter.”

Packett is not certain her reorganised trip for November will go ahead but says she is hopeful things will have stabilised by then.

“We’re not confident it will happen we’re hoping more people will be vaccinated so we’ve just got to be hopeful.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYXR0bGVjcmVla2VucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA1LzI5L3Bob3Rvcy13YWxrdGhyb3VnaC1vdXRwb3N0LXRyZWVob3VzZS1haXJibmItZWFzdC1sZXJveS83NDU1NDIyMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: Walkthrough Outpost Treehouse Airbnb in East Leroy,"Photos: Walkthrough Outpost Treehouse Airbnb in East Leroy

The 120-year-old buildings has been brought back to life and not a minute too soon.

“The wood was all rotting in some places off the wall. The window frames were all rotting and coming apart” said historic preservationist Jennifer Welch.

Welch restores historic buildings. The town’s Presbyterian church was her latest challenge. The building sat abandoned for decades with peeling paint cracks and water leaks.

“I just knew somebody needed to love it ” said Welch.

Welch transformed the inside into what will be an Airbnb complete with kitchen sofas replacing the pews and the old choir loft turned into a dining area.

“That way we have an opportunity to give it back to the community in a way they can use it and enjoy it ” said Welch.

And learn a little church history its story told in original wood floors and trim. Finely detailed windows were carved by those who called the church home.

“All of this glass is clear which is interesting because the German immigrants who built this building were poor so they couldn’t have afforded stained glass” said Welch.

The church’s original Bible box was found intact.

“Attendees to church would’ve come in they would’ve opened the Bible box chosen their Bible and then come and have a seat in one of the pews” said Welch.

Bringing an old church back to life isn’t easy. It took seven months of hard work. Electrician Rick Neely calls it a combination of blood sweat and tears mixed with love.

“I do it because I love historical projects. I love seeing them brought back to being beautiful again and usable where other people can enjoy them” said Neely.

“It always breaks my heart to see a building that hasn’t been loved and left abandoned. But that’s what drives us to fix them and restore them because we love them and we want to be able to tell their stories” said Welch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNlcnRzdW4uY29tL3N0b3J5L21vbmV5L2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvMDUvMjkvcGFsbS1zcHJpbmdzLWFyZWEtY2l0aWVzLXBheWluZy1jb21wYW5pZXMtcm9vdC1vdXQtc2hvcnQtdGVybS1yZW50YWxzLzc0NDc5NzgwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Operating a short-term rental?

Per sviluppare Domo Connexa l’azienda produttrice si è avvalsa della collaborazione di Nuki impresa austriaca ben conosciuta nel settore delle smartlock. Grazie all’integrazione della piattaforma NUKI chi sceglie Domo Connexa beneficia non solo della sicurezza garantita ma anche della straordinaria facilità di gestione.

Controllo a distanza e sicurezza in tempo reale

«La soluzione intelligente per la porta blindata del futuro una vera e propria Smart Door» spiega Michele Schiavarelli Product Marketing Manager  e prosegue: «Domo Connexa è una serratura equipaggiata di elettronica e motore grazie al quale risponde perfettamente alle esigenze di un numero sempre crescente di italiani che vivono e lavorano in mobilità che necessitano di condividere credenziali con parenti o collaboratori domestici e che desiderano monitorare sempre e ovunque lo stato della porta». La nuova serratura intelligente infatti può essere comodamente gestita a distanza e in tutta sicurezza (con crittografia end-to-end) sia da smartphone sia da piattaforma web. La Smart Door si può collegare alla rete Wi-Fi di casa tramite il Nuki Bridge e attivando la licenza per il servizio di accesso remoto (Remote Access Activation Code). Grazie a questo servizio tutte le funzionalità possono essere gestite anche quando ci si trova lontano da casa.

Le principali funzionalità che offre la Domo Connexa sono:

Aprire la porta tramite smartphone telecomando Bluetooth tastiera Bluetooth

La Nuki app inoltre è gratuita e disponibile per iOS e Android. La soluzione Cisa Domo Connexa è costituita essenzialmente dalla serratura motorizzata Domo e dal pulsante Bluetooth Button a cui si possono aggiungere i vari accessori smart.

Il pulsante intelligente

Cisa Button è il custode della connettività smart che consente di controllare la Smart Door attraverso i vari dispositivi connessi (smartphone telecomando Bluetooth tastiera Bluetooth Bridge). Grazie alla tecnologia Bluetooth Low Energy 5.0 il raggio d’azione dello smartphone si estende e si può tranquillamente aprire la porta dal divano (in caso di rigore dell’Italia ai Mondiali…). Attivando la connettività da remoto è possibile utilizzare l’assistente vocale per aprire la propria porta. Roberta Rizzo Product & Platform Leader Engineering Allegion EMEA ne spiega il funzionamento: «Il cuore pulsante di Domo Connexa è il Cisa Button una tecnologia innovativa sviluppata dal team di Ricerca e Sviluppo di Cisa insieme a Nuki per consentire la gestione della porta a distanza (la chiave diventa solo un back-up meccanico). Il chip contenuto al suo interno dialoga con la serratura motorizzata e permette di aprire la porta in maniera contactless sia dall’interno standosene comodamente seduti sul divano sia dall’esterno a km di distanza con la connettività da remoto attraverso internet». Cuore tecnologico dal design minimale si integra con eleganza in qualsiasi porta dall’espressione contemporanea e grazie alle dimensioni ridotte può essere posizionato ovunque tramite una semplicissima installazione.

They talk about the inaccuracies goofiness etc and apparently lots didn’t realize it was shot at Auto Club Raceway Pomona home of the NHRA Winternationals and World Finals. The commercial is goofy and nobody with half a brain cell would think they were trying to be accurate or serious in the commercial so I’m not sure why that would bother anyone. There are all kinds of inaccuracies and funny stuff that would be more at home with other forms of motorsports. But again that’s not the part that makes me laugh. I’ll be the negative Nelly here and explain.

There are several very easily recognized dragstrips in the United States and Pomona is one of them. It’s also one of the most expensive to rent for something like this. Clearly Allstate has a big budget and given the way they shot the commercial maybe it still makes sense to do it where the cost is so high. But there are plenty of other big dragstrips that could have been used that aren’t sponsored and named for a competing insurance company. This is the part that immediately made me do a double-take. With that said maybe the LA County Fairgrounds and NHRA needed the money since they hadn’t been able to have events. Or maybe this thing got shot before COVID. Who knows.

What I do know is that the coupe in the commercial is owned by the folks at Chino Hills Transmissions. They are good people support lots of Southern California drag racing and build a stout transmission to boot. They are the ones that did the build on the 4L80E that is in Ethyl so it is cool to see their car on a major tv commercial like this.

Anyway enjoy the commercial and let us know what you think.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL3RoZXRhbmRkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9sb2NhbC93YXRjaC1ub3ctaS1hbS1hdC1wZWFjZS13aXRoLWxpZmUtbG9uZ3RpbWUtaW5zdXJhbmNlLWFnZW50LXJldGlyZXMtd2l0aC1jb21tdW5pdHktY2h1cmNoL2FydGljbGVfNmIwYzg2ZDItNDUzMi01MThkLTlhZGQtYTZmY2E3ZDM3ZDIzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WATCH NOW: 'I am at peace with life': Longtime insurance agent retires with community church at heart,"Alonzo D. Middleton knows the value of hard work taking what he learned from his humble farming roots in Orangeburg to become a successful businessman who served the local community he grew up in for more than 30 years.

The longtime Allstate Insurance agent developed a rapport among the sea of customers who came through his door whether they were educators coaches or city leaders.

Tucked away off the St. Matthews Road in a little white house the Alonzo D. Middleton Agency Inc. has been a fixture in the community since Middleton bought and converted the structure into an office in 1990.

His start with Allstate began as early as 1985 with Middleton first serving out of an insurance booth in the old Sears Roebuck & Company building in Orangeburg with partner Wayne Lorick.

“Back then Sears was the first place they would put an Allstate agent. When they created the Neighborhood Office Agent program is when I was able to buy a place” Middleton said.

His first office was at 1004 Chestnut St. Middleton then rented an office space at 900 Chestnut St. with partner David Lawson before purchasing his current building at 1712 St. Matthews Road.

His wife of 45 years Glenda had by then become his business partner and the rest became history.

“God had blessed us to be in our hometown doing this wonderful work. I started in the Sears store in a booth and it was about as big as a telephone booth. It wasn’t very personable and then I was able to relocate. Then I bought this (St. Matthews Road) building in about 1990. It just became industrial and commercial in this area. God put me in the right place at the right time” Middleton said.

“We’ve had some wonderful centers of influence that helped us move forward. After going back and forth and doing some things God has really blessed me to be able to come home and be at a very fertile part of the community” he said.

Health challenges have recently sidelined the 63-year-old who officially retired Dec. 31 2020 after 36 years of service with Allstate. Short-term memory loss and the diabetes which has resulted in poor circulation and the amputation of seven toes have not however altered his memory of his humble beginnings and the work ethic that began on his great-grandfather’s farm.

‘It’s been very rewarding’

“I was born on 1994 Myers Road in Orangeburg on my great-grandfather’s farm. My mother basically was a single parent. My grandmother raised me right there on the farm. We had apples scuppernongs corn soybeans and all that kind of stuff” Middleton said.

His grandmother Retha Bell Middleton worked in the infirmary at then-South Carolina State College.

“She was the center of influence of my life because my mother Jalania lived in Winston-Salem. She took care of all the children. You know how in the ‘50s we kind of did things as a team. Boy I tell you they worked me on that farm over there on Myers Road” Middleton said.

Middleton recalled that growing up in Orangeburg had its challenges including the loss of his uncle Delano Middleton in the Orangeburg Massacre of 1968.

It was on that fateful night 53 years ago that S.C. State College students Henry Smith and Samuel Hammond along with 17-year-old Wilkinson High School student Delano Middleton were killed and 28 others injured when S.C. Highway Patrol troopers opened fire on a crowd of protesters following three nights of escalating racial tension over efforts to desegregate the All-Star Triangle Bowl.

“Part of my history was football. My uncle played center on the football team and the basketball team and I was a running back. He taught me everything I knew about football” Middleton said.

He said the loss of his uncle made him “want the things that are good about Orangeburg.”

“There is always somebody trying to say something negative about it because of the incident. But it made me realize that my real goal was right here from where I started from right there at 1994 Myers Road” said Middleton noting that his uncle always encouraged him to study.

“I've got a picture of him up in the office right now. ... In the 1960s we had a lot of social uprising and things going on. I was witnessing all these things” he said.

Middleton continued “I was born in ’57 but the ‘60s was really a rushed time and I was able to take the energy that I had to do some things a lot more for myself my wife my family and for the community of Orangeburg in itself because of the things that did happen here in the ‘60s. We weren’t exempt from that heartbreak.”

Middleton who first met his wife in the seventh grade is a graduate of Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School and later attended Michigan State University where he was an award-winning football player and earned a bachelor of arts degree in urban development.

“I still have my association with the university. I played football four years there and enjoyed a wonderful life in a place different from Orangeburg. I was a Parade All-American in football. I wanted to play basketball but I couldn’t hang with the boys” he said.

Middleton said his business acumen came from his late mother.

“I was in North Carolina working around my mother. She worked at Hedgepeth Cleaners and she kind of gave me a background of selling. She always sold something. Every Saturday you could find a yard sale somewhere. She really taught me a lot about how to be a presence trying to encourage someone to take something off your hand that you didn’t want to take back home” Middleton said.

He added “My mother was wonderful. She could sell a burnt spider. She really could find quality in the little small things. I think that’s where it came from. God gave me the opportunity and gave me a wife that supported me.

“She’s been the CEO of this business ever since we started it. She was the best CEO I could ever have and the best companion and friend when customers hurt my feelings. This is a business where you don’t smile every day even though you’re supposed to but it’s been very rewarding and we did it at home.”

‘I was just so blessed’

Middleton said a lifelong career in the insurance business began with his two-year stint with American National Insurance.

“I think the Lord had more to do what that than anything. I had so many contacts and people know I had a lot of contacts. They said ‘Well why don’t you look into this field?’ I was with American National first. They just did life insurance and things of that nature. I found out that I had so many friends that were calling me about other lines of insurance homeowners and this and that” Middleton said.

“I said ‘Well I better try to see whether I can get with a company with a name brand like that.’ I went to a name brand school Michigan State University and played football. I said ‘Maybe it works the same way.’ I’ve been blessed now 36 years” he said.

What did he like most about selling insurance?

“I think having the right team to work with. When you go to work and leave with your significant other every day and can really do this job the right way it’s a blessing. The blessing was to have my co-partner in life as my co-partner in work” Middleton said.

He and his wife Glenda are the parents of two sons Alonzo II 35 and Zachary 33.

“She would not allow me to miss my appointments or to disrespect anyone and I respected her. My wife has been my arm leg foot everything. My two boys have come in and learned the business and really give their mother the ultimate respect and honor because I couldn’t do it without her” Middleton said.

What did he like least about his job?

“I think the hardest part is finding that you have customers sometimes not give you the correct information or try to hide information from you in doing your job efficiently because of a bad driver’s record or that kind of thing” Middleton said.

“But mainly I think the hardest part is to find a location and get a set location to do your job efficiently and not think about all those bills coming in at the same time and paying your people that you have to help you be a better agency” he said.

Middleton continued “Having people who can do the same job efficiently when you need to take a day off makes a big difference in how we were able to do it so many years. I never had any experience in life after football. I learned to do this by my love of people and the ability to study the manuals and move on. I can’t remember a whole lot of people in my family who had this experience in life.”

The longtime businessman said he’s been blessed.

“I was born in ’57 and now we’re way in the 2000s. I was just so blessed to be able to be a center of influence in my hometown. It’s very difficult sometimes to get people to come to you when they don’t really know whether or not you’re able to do these things.

“I come from a farming background. Getting the pigs and mules and stuff started was how I born and raised on Myers Road with my great-grandfather. I was able to do some things that I dreamed about doing and not have to play football all the time” Middleton said.

Glenda said it’s been hard not being able to serve customers upon her husband’s retirement particularly since many had become like family.

“It becomes one of those things where you make connections with people. I said we’ve literally served royalty coming through the door: educators a lot of the city leaders coaches and community persons and other business persons who we’ve met. They have entrusted this type of help through him and that’s been a true blessing” she said.

Mrs. Middleton added “When you look back at things it’s like wow. So many have come through here and we’ve formulated wonderful friendships.”

She said they’ve almost seen the “whole cycle of life” when customer’s children come back to them for service.

“They’ll refer them to where their ground roots began. That’s been a blessing no doubt. It has been one of those things. The people. I even felt myself crying one day as I was driving up” she noted.

Middleton said “Sometimes you make good friends and you keep good friends. We’ve been able to keep most of our friendships and it’s built this business to the point of 36 years.”

He also credited other positive influences in his life for his success including retired Orangeburg businessman George Dean who owned Dean’s Ltd. on the corner of Russell Street.

“George has been a center of influence for many years and somebody that I admire. He’s been on the corner a long time. He’s been one of those people that just stayed after me to do the right thing” Middleton said.

‘It has been an amazing journey’

Glenda said her husband had always been involved in their son’s lives even serving as president of the Parent-Teacher Associations president of the Booster Clubs and in various other capacities at their schools including as a Little League baseball coach.

“I did football and baseball little league but I did football at the middle schools” Middleton said.

Glenda said “They could always depend on him to be there. He was always providing different meals especially with the little leagues. Later on is when the golfing came in for his own personal enjoyment. He got into that and all these trophies would pop up all over the place.”

While his sons have not expressed interest in carrying on the insurance business Middleton is not spending time moping about that.

“I’m closer to Jesus Christ. The difference in my life is knowing that I had a savior saving me while I was on the job. Now that I have surrendered all of my wants needs and all those desires to the Lord who has provided for me all these years I am at peace with life and peace in a way that I never thought I would have this kind of life” said Middleton an active member of Greater Faith Baptist Church in Orangeburg.

He plans to spend his retirement taking it easy with his loving wife by his side.

“My wife is kind of my planner. I don’t cook. So I won’t be doing that. I used to try to do a little barbecuing but I don’t try to do that anymore. I don’t like the smoke and with the way my food tastes after I finish cooking it sometimes people say ‘Oh no that’s not his gift.’ But I let the guys from church do it and I just help out with the physical part. It takes a gift to do all that” Middleton said.

Glenda said “He has energy to get out in the yard. We’ve done that. So the farming and what his grandfather instilled in him is still a blessing. He’s a workhouse when he puts his mind to it. Then of course the feet and legs start giving way and he goes ‘Oh I’m tired.’ I say ‘Please rest and sit.’”

She continued “It would be nice to do some traveling but it’s not concretely there just yet. My twin sister lives in Atlanta. I think that’s the farthest I’ve tried to venture out but Charleston is always a wonderful place just to go and inhale the air there from time to time.”

Mrs. Middleton said the couple also enjoys spending time with her 92-year-old mother.

“She likes to get out. She’s a retired home economics teacher. Mom used to take her students traveling so many different places giving them the experience of seeing other parts of the world in a general sense ... She still has that go spirit in her blood.”

She said she is also looking forward to her family spending time at the county’s nearly completed library and conference center.

“The Lord has protected us in and through it all. It has been an amazing journey. We have served royalty and thank them for allowing us to serve them” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd2ZGlzcGF0Y2guY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvd3Zocy1zdHVkZW50LWF0aGxldGVzLW9mLXRoZS13ZWVrLWthZGVuY2Utc2NobHV0ZXItb2xpdmVyLWJpZWxpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WVHS Student-Athletes of the Week: Kadence Schluter & Oliver Bieling – The Warwick Valley Dispatch,"By Gregory Sirico WVCSD Athletic Director

""The reality is that the stuff we’ve uncovered is shocking"" Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich told FOX Business in an interview last week. ""It just confirms that Google is doing everything it can to spy on everyone it can without providing any sort of notice to anyone.""

ROKU ACCUSES GOOGLE OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE TACTICS IN YOUTUBE TV NEGOTIATIONS

Brnovich's office sued Google in May of last year alleging that the tech giant used deceptive and unfair practices to track users' location even if they had opted out -- and used that information to target users with ads that generated more than $130 billion in revenue in 2019.

The practice had initially been revealed after an Associated Press article in 2018 reported that Google could continue to track users' locations even after they had opted out of Google getting access into ""location history."" The outlet reported that even with location history paused some Google apps automatically store time-stamped data without a prompt such as storing a snapshot of a location just when someone opens its ""Maps"" application.

Google later tweaked its privacy settings but Brnovich launched the lawsuit in May 2020 – part of a broader anti-Big Tech push by Republican attorneys general and lawmakers. The state alleges that Google acted deceptively misleading consumers.

""We allege when consumers try to opt out of Google collecting location data the company is continuing to find misleading ways to obtain that information and then use it for their financial advantage"" Brnovich told FOX Business.

Google has accused Arizona of misconstruing what Google does and that the lawsuit has been encouraged by Oracle -- which has fought with Google in court over the rights to software code used in its Android software. Bloomberg News reported how Oracle has been lobbying regulators and law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and the E.U. to go after Google including over privacy concerns.

""The Attorney General and our competitors driving this lawsuit have gone out of their way to mischaracterize our services"" Google spokesperson José Castañeda told Fox News. ""We have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data. We look forward to setting the record straight.""

As part of the discovery process emails between Google engineers sent in the wake of the 2018 AP article show that they had concerns about the practice and believed the concerns raised in the article were valid. Some of those emails became public last year but others were released recently as the process continues.

""So there is no way to give a third party app your location and not Google? This doesn’t sound like something we would want on the front page of the NYT"" one employee says in a newly unredacted section first reported by The Arizona Mirror.

""I agree with the article. Location off should mean location off not except for this case or that case"" another says.

HAWLEY HITS BACK AT FACEBOOK'S DARK MONEY GROUP TARGETING HIS ANTI-TRUST PUSH

""Real people just think in terms of ‘location is on’ ‘location is off’ because that is exactly what you have on the front screen of your phone"" another says.

Brnovich says the emails indicate that Google employees knew that what it was doing would upset customers.

""What we've uncovered so far I believe shows that Google themselves understand and appreciate that what they are doing is something that is sneaky and something that would piss off consumers if they knew about it"" he said. ""So the fact they are trying to hide what they are doing they are being sneaky about it and using every trick in the arsenal to stop this from seeing the light of day is all consumers need to know about Google’s intentions.""

As for what is next in the lawsuit Brnovich tells FOX Business the state will continue to depose Google employees about the case and there is another periodic status update next month. He believes that the case will likely go to trial next year.

While there have been a number of Republican efforts to crack down on the influence of Big Tech whether it be privacy concerns or alleged censorship by companies like Twitter Brnovich denies that it is a partisan issue.

""This isn't a Republican or a Democrat issue"" he said. When we launched this investigation to protect Arizona consumers in Arizona state court it was unique and it was different and it was groundbreaking.""

He also acknowledges that fighting a massive corporation like Google is an uphill climb.

""Google has an army of lawyers and lobbyists and they have done everything they can to procedurally stop up from getting to the merits of the lawsuit and quite frankly to hide what they are doing"" he said.

Major US stock indices S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) have closed the month of May on a positive note after slight gains to Friday’s trading session. While the former grew 0.077% to 4204.11 the Dow Jones recorded a growth of 0.19% adding 64.81 points to close at 34529.45. The Nasdaq Composite (INDEXNASDAQ: .IXIC) also closed the session up with a 0.091% growth to 13748.74.

For the month of May the S&P 500 (INDEXSP: .INX) added 0.6% a growth boosted by the break-in its two- weeks losing streak after the past week’s growth of 1.2%. The Dow Jones also ended the week with positive growth surging 0.9% to close the month positively by adding 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite came off with different performance closing 1.5% lower to record its worst performance in seven months.

Unusually the positive performance of the stock indices was not driven by the FAANG stocks or major tech firms. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) recorded a 1.21% loss to close Friday’s session at $328.73 per share. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) dropped 0.53% to $124.61 while e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) slipped by 0.22% to $3223.07. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) also dropped 0.21% and 0.25% with shares cresting at $502.81 and $2356.85 respectively.

Amid these poor performances however Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE: CRM) led the growth in the Dow Jones after it reported better than expected first-quarter earnings. The stock grew 5.43% to $238.10.

S&P 500 Dow Jones Growth Boosted by Growing Savings Rate

The broad performance of the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones was backed by the boosted savings rate which came in at 14.9% last month as well as the consumer spendings that etched upwards by 0.5% per the estimates.

This economic metric appears enough for investors as the overall inflation indicated the personal consumption expenditures index came in at 3.1% for April a figure that is higher than the projected 2.9%.

“This report puts the Fed in a really good place inflation is up but real yields are still low. This is basically the transitory sweet spot” said Jamie Cox managing partner at Harris Financial Group.

Other stocks that received increased retail investor activities include Reddit favorite GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME) which ended the day with a loss of 12.64% after recording impressive growth in the intraday session. GameStop shared are exchanging hands at $222.70 in the After Hours session.

It gets tricky when you count how many different organizations recognize a national title but eight is the generally accepted number.

However there are several other teams that were good enough to take home the ultimate prize but didn’t because of one bad game an unlucky break or two or other unrealized potential. You could make the argument that some teams that didn’t win the national championship were better collectively than some that did.

ESPN has tackled that theme and ranked the top 50 college football teams not to win a national championship and two OSU teams made the list. We think there’s a glaring omission but we’ll get to that later.

For now you can take a look at the complete list for yourself by visiting ESPN.com and enjoying the memories (subscription required). For now though here are the two Buckeye teams Bill Connelly highlighted.

NEXT … A “Tie”

No. 18-19 “Tie” – 1973 Ohio State football team

What Connelly Says

Record: 10-0-1

AP rank: second

“Arguably Ohio State’s three biggest wins over Michigan: 30-27 in 2016 42-39 in 2006 … and 10-10 in 1973. The No. 4 Wolverines missed two field goals in the final 30 seconds against top-ranked Ohio State in Ann Arbor and the next day Big Ten athletic directors voted to send the Buckeyes to the Rose Bowl instead of the Wolverines despite the fact that OSU had been there the year before.

“Most ADs publicly cited an injury to Michigan QB Dennis Franklin as the major reason for the vote. UM head coach Bo Schembechler cried conspiracy until his dying day. Regardless both of these programs were at their outright peak in 1973. In the 20 games that weren’t against each other they outscored opponents 723-112. That includes OSU’s 42-21 destruction of USC in the Rose Bowl. Michigan probably would have done something similar.”

What Connelly Says

Record: 13-1

AP rank: third

“We remember Ryan Day’s 2019 Buckeyes primarily for the game they lost: a controversial and utterly magnificent 29-23 defeat against Clemson that sent the Tigers to CFP final against LSU. But what OSU did in its first 13 games made it an all-time great. It won its first 10 games by an average of 52-10 then beat three straight top-10 teams — Penn State Michigan Wisconsin — by an average of 17 points to get to Clemson. Justin Fields threw for 3273 yards J.K. Dobbins rushed for 2003 and DE Chase Young was the best defender in the country. An unreal team with an unfortunate ending.”

NEXT … What we say

Two more Ohio State teams that should have won a national title?

2015 Team

Record: 13-1

AP rank: fourth

The 1973 and 2019 teams are worthy of this list but there are two Ohio State teams glaringly committed that should be a part of it. Ezekiel Elliott J.T. Barrett Cardale Jones Joey Bosa Michael Thomas Curtis Samuel Braxton Miller. All of those guys and more were key contributors the team coming back after making a surprising run for the national title in 2014. It might be the most talented bunch to ever suit up in scarlet gray. You know the story well but the Buckeyes fell by three points in a bit of a weather quagmire to Michigan State who by the way made the CFP themselves.

Somehow that team didn’t get any recognition when discussing the teams to make the College Football Playoff and we wonder if the same were to hold true if Alabama were in the same prediciment. The Buckeyes went on to dismantle Michigan then did the same against Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl. Three points. That’s all that separated a team that should have won it all.

Another team that should have won the title

The 1998 Team

Record: 11-1

AP rank: second

And we can’t forget about the 1998 team either. It was the preseason No. 1 team heading into the season but also fell to Michigan State in a weird game that turned on some strange turnovers and 50/50 balls the Spartans seemed to always come up with when needed. The Spartans erased a 24-9 lead scoring 19 unanswered points in the second half to win 28-24 intercepting a Joe Germaine pass in the end zone with OSU driving for the win to seal it.

Some of the names on that team included Germaine David Boston Dee Miller Andy Katzemoyer Damon Moore Antoine Winfield and Michael Wiley. Prior to the 2015 team it was the most dominant squad I had ever witnessed in my lifetime.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA1LzMwL3ByZWRpY3Rpb24tdGhlc2Utd2lsbC1iZS0xMC1sYXJnZXN0LXN0b2Nrcy1ieS0yMDM1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prediction: These Will Be the 10 Largest Stocks by 2035,"Change is inevitable. The biggest stocks in the world by market cap will undoubtedly look a bit different in 14 years.

If there's one constant on Wall Street it's that nothing remains constant for long. The combination of technological innovation competitive advantages acquisitions and other tangible and intangible factors has a tendency to shake-up the world's largest companies on a regular basis.

For example in 2004 General Electric ExxonMobil Pfizer Citigroup Walmart BP AIG Intel and Bank of America were nine of the 10 largest publicly traded companies by market cap. None are still in the top 10 just 17 years later. In fact AIG isn't even in the top 250 anymore.

What might the top 10 look like in 2035? Frankly we don't know. But given a number of proliferating high-growth trends it won't stop me from making a prediction. In 14 years these are likely to be the world's 10 largest publicly traded companies presented in no particular order.

Amazon

Unless e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN 0.80%) decides to spin off its leading cloud infrastructure segment Amazon Web Services (AWS) I consider it to have the best chance of being the largest company by market cap in 2035. Amazon currently controls more than 40% of all online sales in the U.S. and it's signed up 200 million people to Prime worldwide. The fees it collects from Prime memberships help to ensure it can undercut brick-and-mortar retailers on price.

As for AWS it grew sales by 30% in 2020 (i.e. during the worst economic downturn in decades). AWS has a current run-rate of $54 billion in annual sales meaning it alone could fetch a valuation north of $600 billion and still be valued cheaply within the cloud space. Because AWS generates considerably higher margins than retail it's Amazon's key to a cash flow explosion in the years to come.

Microsoft

Despite a myriad of change since 1999 tech stock Microsoft (MSFT 0.43%) is the only company to remain in the top 10 by market cap in 1999 2004 2009 2014 2019 and currently. Thus it's a safe bet to suggest it'll hang onto a top-10 spot over the coming 14 years.

Although Microsoft is still generating plenty of cash flow from its legacy software and Windows operating system the cloud is its future. Cloud infrastructure service Azure along with enterprise and consumer cloud products across all of its core brands (Office Dynamics and Windows) can fuel sustainable double-digit or high single-digit growth for a long time to come.

Plus Microsoft is loaded with cash meaning it can use acquisitions as a means to boost its growth prospects and remain competitive.

Apple

Speaking of cash cows I believe Apple (AAPL 1.00%) remains safely in the top 10 even if its growth rate were to taper a bit. Keep in mind that Apple generated nearly $100 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing 12 months which means the company has an abundant cash pile to buy back its stock pay dividends reinvest in innovation and make the occasional acquisition to bolster its product portfolio.

In the years to come Tim Cook will continue to oversee Apple's transition to a services company. Subscription services boast higher margins than most products Apple sells and will help reduce the revenue lumpiness associated with tech replacement cycles.

Facebook

The social media space has proved especially fickle over the past 15 years so there's certainly the risk Facebook (META 0.60%) won't be one of the 10 largest companies by 2035. It could also be broken up by regulators which would potentially remove it from consideration.

However I chose to keep Facebook in the top 10 for two simple reasons. First it had 44% of the world's population visit one of its owned assets in the first quarter. This makes it unlikely that any social media company will unseat it in the eyes of advertisers anytime soon.

Second Facebook has only monetized two of its four prized assets (its namesake site and Instagram). When it decides to meaningfully monetize WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger it'll enjoy a massive multiyear growth spurt.

Alphabet

As with Facebook ad-driven operating models come with risks. Thankfully Alphabet (GOOGL 0.34%) (GOOG 0.24%) has ancillary operations and history on its side.

In terms of ancillary businesses streaming content provider YouTube has grown into a top-three social media destination and cloud infrastructure service Google Cloud now has an annual run-rate of more than $16 billion. Eventually Cloud is going to do for Alphabet what AWS has done (and will continue to do) for Amazon.

Meanwhile Alphabet's core business -- its Google internet search engine -- should benefit from long periods of economic expansion and the company's insane global share of internet search which has ranged from 91% to 93% for two years.

Airbnb

Perhaps the first big surprise is that I expect stay-and-hosting company Airbnb (ABNB -6.87%) to work its way into the top 10. That's because Airbnb is disrupting both the hotel stay side of the industry as well as the travel side of the equation.

At the moment Airbnb has 4 million hosts worldwide. This is just a fraction of what the platform is capable of handling given the more than 130 million residences in the U.S. and around 1 billion residences worldwide.

Airbnb has also been pushing its Experiences platform -- i.e. adventures led by local experts. Nothing can stop Airbnb from entrenching itself further in vacation experiences. We're witnessing the early innings of true leisure industry disruption.

Square

Fintech stock Square (SQ 2.90%) also has a very real opportunity to surpass PayPal over the next 14 years and work its way into the top 10.

Although Square should see steady growth from its seller ecosystem the company's primary driver will be peer-to-peer digital payments platform Cash App. In three years Cash App's monthly active user count has more than quintupled to 36 million. It's been a more popular download than PayPal's Venmo and Square has been generating $41 in gross profit per user compared to less than $5 in acquisition costs per user.

Square also completed the charter process to operate its own bank in March. This gives the company a full gamut of financial services it can offer in the high-margin digital banking space.

Visa

As of May 25 payment processing giant Visa (V 0.49%) was clinging the No. 10 spot with a $487 billion market cap $3 billion ahead of JPMorgan Chase. I believe in 14 years it'll still be clinging to a top-10 spot and likely pushing above a $1 trillion valuation.

Visa is a cyclical business which is a simple way of saying that it does really well when the U.S. and global economy are expanding and it struggles a bit when recession arise. However this is a numbers game Visa is well-prepared to play. Periods of expansion last significantly longer than contractions. What's more Visa isn't a lender which means it's not required to set aside cash for delinquent loans when recession strike. Thus why it bounces back so quickly from economic contractions.

With a majority of the world's transactions still conducted in cash Visa's growth runway extends decades into the future.

Berkshire Hathaway

In 14 years it's unlikely that Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are going to be running Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.61%) (BRK.B 0.60%) or dictating its investments. Thankfully Buffett has laid out a winning game plan for his successors that should result in continued growth.

Similar to the Visa growth thesis (Visa is one of Berkshire's four-dozen holdings) most of Buffett's investment portfolio is tied up in cyclical businesses. The Oracle of Omaha has always thrived on playing the numbers game and betting on multiyear periods of economic expansion. He also loves a good dividend stock which is why Coca-Cola and American Express have been so valuable.

The wildcard here will be investment lieutenants Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. If they maintain Buffett's long-term approach and avoid trying to time the market Berkshire Hathaway should be one of the 10 largest stocks come 2035.

Sea Limited

A final surprise that could find its way into the top 10 is Singapore-based Sea Limited (SE -1.14%). A veritable no-name a couple of years ago Sea has three extremely fast-growing businesses that could all help it reach a trillion-dollar valuation by 2035.

While mobile gaming is its primary generator of positive adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the time being it's e-commerce platform Shopee that'll be Sea's core sales and profit driver over the long run. ""But what about Amazon?"" you ask? Don't fret. Sea is primarily focused on emerging markets where the middle class is still taking shape. Sea and Amazon can thrive in their own separate niches.

Sea also has a nascent mobile wallet segment that could provide financial solutions to largely underbanked regions of Southeastern Asia. It has all the tools needed to be one of the world's largest companies."

""The reality is that the stuff we’ve uncovered is shocking"" Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich told FOX Business in an interview last week. ""It just confirms that Google is doing everything it can to spy on everyone it can without providing any sort of notice to anyone.""

ROKU ACCUSES GOOGLE OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE TACTICS IN YOUTUBE TV NEGOTIATIONS

Brnovich's office sued Google in May of last year alleging that the tech giant used deceptive and unfair practices to track users' location even if they had opted out -- and used that information to target users with ads that generated more than $130 billion in revenue in 2019.

The practice had initially been revealed after an Associated Press article in 2018 reported that Google could continue to track users' locations even after they had opted out of Google getting access into ""location history."" The outlet reported that even with location history paused some Google apps automatically store time-stamped data without a prompt such as storing a snapshot of a location just when someone opens its ""Maps"" application.

Google later tweaked its privacy settings but Brnovich launched the lawsuit in May 2020 – part of a broader anti-Big Tech push by Republican attorneys general and lawmakers. The state alleges that Google acted deceptively misleading consumers.

""We allege when consumers try to opt out of Google collecting location data the company is continuing to find misleading ways to obtain that information and then use it for their financial advantage"" Brnovich told FOX Business.

Google has accused Arizona of misconstruing what Google does and that the lawsuit has been encouraged by Oracle -- which has fought with Google in court over the rights to software code used in its Android software. Bloomberg News reported how Oracle has been lobbying regulators and law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and the E.U. to go after Google including over privacy concerns.

""The Attorney General and our competitors driving this lawsuit have gone out of their way to mischaracterize our services"" Google spokesperson José Castañeda told Fox News. ""We have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data. We look forward to setting the record straight.""

As part of the discovery process emails between Google engineers sent in the wake of the 2018 AP article show that they had concerns about the practice and believed the concerns raised in the article were valid. Some of those emails became public last year but others were released recently as the process continues.

""So there is no way to give a third party app your location and not Google? This doesn’t sound like something we would want on the front page of the NYT"" one employee says in a newly unredacted section first reported by The Arizona Mirror.

""I agree with the article. Location off should mean location off not except for this case or that case"" another says.

HAWLEY HITS BACK AT FACEBOOK'S DARK MONEY GROUP TARGETING HIS ANTI-TRUST PUSH

""Real people just think in terms of ‘location is on’ ‘location is off’ because that is exactly what you have on the front screen of your phone"" another says.

Brnovich says the emails indicate that Google employees knew that what it was doing would upset customers.

""What we've uncovered so far I believe shows that Google themselves understand and appreciate that what they are doing is something that is sneaky and something that would piss off consumers if they knew about it"" he said. ""So the fact they are trying to hide what they are doing they are being sneaky about it and using every trick in the arsenal to stop this from seeing the light of day is all consumers need to know about Google’s intentions.""

As for what is next in the lawsuit Brnovich tells FOX Business the state will continue to depose Google employees about the case and there is another periodic status update next month. He believes that the case will likely go to trial next year.

While there have been a number of Republican efforts to crack down on the influence of Big Tech whether it be privacy concerns or alleged censorship by companies like Twitter Brnovich denies that it is a partisan issue.

""This isn't a Republican or a Democrat issue"" he said. When we launched this investigation to protect Arizona consumers in Arizona state court it was unique and it was different and it was groundbreaking.""

He also acknowledges that fighting a massive corporation like Google is an uphill climb.

""Google has an army of lawyers and lobbyists and they have done everything they can to procedurally stop up from getting to the merits of the lawsuit and quite frankly to hide what they are doing"" he said.

Major US stock indices S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX: .DJI) have closed the month of May on a positive note after slight gains to Friday’s trading session. While the former grew 0.077% to 4204.11 the Dow Jones recorded a growth of 0.19% adding 64.81 points to close at 34529.45. The Nasdaq Composite (INDEXNASDAQ: .IXIC) also closed the session up with a 0.091% growth to 13748.74.

For the month of May the S&P 500 (INDEXSP: .INX) added 0.6% a growth boosted by the break-in its two- weeks losing streak after the past week’s growth of 1.2%. The Dow Jones also ended the week with positive growth surging 0.9% to close the month positively by adding 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite came off with different performance closing 1.5% lower to record its worst performance in seven months.

Unusually the positive performance of the stock indices was not driven by the FAANG stocks or major tech firms. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) recorded a 1.21% loss to close Friday’s session at $328.73 per share. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) dropped 0.53% to $124.61 while e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) slipped by 0.22% to $3223.07. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) also dropped 0.21% and 0.25% with shares cresting at $502.81 and $2356.85 respectively.

Amid these poor performances however Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE: CRM) led the growth in the Dow Jones after it reported better than expected first-quarter earnings. The stock grew 5.43% to $238.10.

S&P 500 Dow Jones Growth Boosted by Growing Savings Rate

The broad performance of the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones was backed by the boosted savings rate which came in at 14.9% last month as well as the consumer spendings that etched upwards by 0.5% per the estimates.

This economic metric appears enough for investors as the overall inflation indicated the personal consumption expenditures index came in at 3.1% for April a figure that is higher than the projected 2.9%.

“This report puts the Fed in a really good place inflation is up but real yields are still low. This is basically the transitory sweet spot” said Jamie Cox managing partner at Harris Financial Group.

It gets tricky when you count how many different organizations recognize a national title but eight is the generally accepted number.

However there are several other teams that were good enough to take home the ultimate prize but didn’t because of one bad game an unlucky break or two or other unrealized potential. You could make the argument that some teams that didn’t win the national championship were better collectively than some that did.

ESPN has tackled that theme and ranked the top 50 college football teams not to win a national championship and two OSU teams made the list. We think there’s a glaring omission but we’ll get to that later.

For now you can take a look at the complete list for yourself by visiting ESPN.com and enjoying the memories (subscription required). For now though here are the two Buckeye teams Bill Connelly highlighted.

NEXT … A “Tie”

No. 18-19 “Tie” – 1973 Ohio State football team

What Connelly Says

Record: 10-0-1

AP rank: second

“Arguably Ohio State’s three biggest wins over Michigan: 30-27 in 2016 42-39 in 2006 … and 10-10 in 1973. The No. 4 Wolverines missed two field goals in the final 30 seconds against top-ranked Ohio State in Ann Arbor and the next day Big Ten athletic directors voted to send the Buckeyes to the Rose Bowl instead of the Wolverines despite the fact that OSU had been there the year before.

“Most ADs publicly cited an injury to Michigan QB Dennis Franklin as the major reason for the vote. UM head coach Bo Schembechler cried conspiracy until his dying day. Regardless both of these programs were at their outright peak in 1973. In the 20 games that weren’t against each other they outscored opponents 723-112. That includes OSU’s 42-21 destruction of USC in the Rose Bowl. Michigan probably would have done something similar.”

What Connelly Says

Record: 13-1

AP rank: third

“We remember Ryan Day’s 2019 Buckeyes primarily for the game they lost: a controversial and utterly magnificent 29-23 defeat against Clemson that sent the Tigers to CFP final against LSU. But what OSU did in its first 13 games made it an all-time great. It won its first 10 games by an average of 52-10 then beat three straight top-10 teams — Penn State Michigan Wisconsin — by an average of 17 points to get to Clemson. Justin Fields threw for 3273 yards J.K. Dobbins rushed for 2003 and DE Chase Young was the best defender in the country. An unreal team with an unfortunate ending.”

Two more Ohio State teams that should have won a national title?

2015 Team

Record: 13-1

AP rank: fourth

The 1973 and 2019 teams are worthy of this list but there are two Ohio State teams glaringly committed that should be a part of it. Ezekiel Elliott J.T. Barrett Cardale Jones Joey Bosa Michael Thomas Curtis Samuel Braxton Miller. All of those guys and more were key contributors the team coming back after making a surprising run for the national title in 2014. It might be the most talented bunch to ever suit up in scarlet gray. You know the story well but the Buckeyes fell by three points in a bit of a weather quagmire to Michigan State who by the way made the CFP themselves.

Somehow that team didn’t get any recognition when discussing the teams to make the College Football Playoff and we wonder if the same were to hold true if Alabama were in the same prediciment. The Buckeyes went on to dismantle Michigan then did the same against Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl. Three points. That’s all that separated a team that should have won it all.

The 1998 Team

Record: 11-1

AP rank: second

And we can’t forget about the 1998 team either. It was the preseason No. 1 team heading into the season but also fell to Michigan State in a weird game that turned on some strange turnovers and 50/50 balls the Spartans seemed to always come up with when needed. The Spartans erased a 24-9 lead scoring 19 unanswered points in the second half to win 28-24 intercepting a Joe Germaine pass in the end zone with OSU driving for the win to seal it.

Some of the names on that team included Germaine David Boston Dee Miller Andy Katzemoyer Damon Moore Antoine Winfield and Michael Wiley. Prior to the 2015 team it was the most dominant squad I had ever witnessed in my lifetime.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA1LzMwL3ByZWRpY3Rpb24tdGhlc2Utd2lsbC1iZS0xMC1sYXJnZXN0LXN0b2Nrcy1ieS0yMDM1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prediction: These Will Be the 10 Largest Stocks by 2035,"Change is inevitable. The biggest stocks in the world by market cap will undoubtedly look a bit different in 14 years.

If there's one constant on Wall Street it's that nothing remains constant for long. The combination of technological innovation competitive advantages acquisitions and other tangible and intangible factors has a tendency to shake-up the world's largest companies on a regular basis.

For example in 2004 General Electric ExxonMobil Pfizer Citigroup Walmart BP AIG Intel and Bank of America were nine of the 10 largest publicly traded companies by market cap. None are still in the top 10 just 17 years later. In fact AIG isn't even in the top 250 anymore.

What might the top 10 look like in 2035? Frankly we don't know. But given a number of proliferating high-growth trends it won't stop me from making a prediction. In 14 years these are likely to be the world's 10 largest publicly traded companies presented in no particular order.

Amazon

Unless e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN 0.80%) decides to spin off its leading cloud infrastructure segment Amazon Web Services (AWS) I consider it to have the best chance of being the largest company by market cap in 2035. Amazon currently controls more than 40% of all online sales in the U.S. and it's signed up 200 million people to Prime worldwide. The fees it collects from Prime memberships help to ensure it can undercut brick-and-mortar retailers on price.

As for AWS it grew sales by 30% in 2020 (i.e. during the worst economic downturn in decades). AWS has a current run-rate of $54 billion in annual sales meaning it alone could fetch a valuation north of $600 billion and still be valued cheaply within the cloud space. Because AWS generates considerably higher margins than retail it's Amazon's key to a cash flow explosion in the years to come.

Microsoft

Despite a myriad of change since 1999 tech stock Microsoft (MSFT 0.43%) is the only company to remain in the top 10 by market cap in 1999 2004 2009 2014 2019 and currently. Thus it's a safe bet to suggest it'll hang onto a top-10 spot over the coming 14 years.

Although Microsoft is still generating plenty of cash flow from its legacy software and Windows operating system the cloud is its future. Cloud infrastructure service Azure along with enterprise and consumer cloud products across all of its core brands (Office Dynamics and Windows) can fuel sustainable double-digit or high single-digit growth for a long time to come.

Plus Microsoft is loaded with cash meaning it can use acquisitions as a means to boost its growth prospects and remain competitive.

Apple

Speaking of cash cows I believe Apple (AAPL 1.00%) remains safely in the top 10 even if its growth rate were to taper a bit. Keep in mind that Apple generated nearly $100 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing 12 months which means the company has an abundant cash pile to buy back its stock pay dividends reinvest in innovation and make the occasional acquisition to bolster its product portfolio.

In the years to come Tim Cook will continue to oversee Apple's transition to a services company. Subscription services boast higher margins than most products Apple sells and will help reduce the revenue lumpiness associated with tech replacement cycles.

Facebook

The social media space has proved especially fickle over the past 15 years so there's certainly the risk Facebook (META 0.60%) won't be one of the 10 largest companies by 2035. It could also be broken up by regulators which would potentially remove it from consideration.

However I chose to keep Facebook in the top 10 for two simple reasons. First it had 44% of the world's population visit one of its owned assets in the first quarter. This makes it unlikely that any social media company will unseat it in the eyes of advertisers anytime soon.

Second Facebook has only monetized two of its four prized assets (its namesake site and Instagram). When it decides to meaningfully monetize WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger it'll enjoy a massive multiyear growth spurt.

Alphabet

As with Facebook ad-driven operating models come with risks. Thankfully Alphabet (GOOGL 0.34%) (GOOG 0.24%) has ancillary operations and history on its side.

In terms of ancillary businesses streaming content provider YouTube has grown into a top-three social media destination and cloud infrastructure service Google Cloud now has an annual run-rate of more than $16 billion. Eventually Cloud is going to do for Alphabet what AWS has done (and will continue to do) for Amazon.

Meanwhile Alphabet's core business -- its Google internet search engine -- should benefit from long periods of economic expansion and the company's insane global share of internet search which has ranged from 91% to 93% for two years.

Airbnb

Perhaps the first big surprise is that I expect stay-and-hosting company Airbnb (ABNB -6.87%) to work its way into the top 10. That's because Airbnb is disrupting both the hotel stay side of the industry as well as the travel side of the equation.

At the moment Airbnb has 4 million hosts worldwide. This is just a fraction of what the platform is capable of handling given the more than 130 million residences in the U.S. and around 1 billion residences worldwide.

Airbnb has also been pushing its Experiences platform -- i.e. adventures led by local experts. Nothing can stop Airbnb from entrenching itself further in vacation experiences. We're witnessing the early innings of true leisure industry disruption.

Square

Fintech stock Square (SQ 2.90%) also has a very real opportunity to surpass PayPal over the next 14 years and work its way into the top 10.

Although Square should see steady growth from its seller ecosystem the company's primary driver will be peer-to-peer digital payments platform Cash App. In three years Cash App's monthly active user count has more than quintupled to 36 million. It's been a more popular download than PayPal's Venmo and Square has been generating $41 in gross profit per user compared to less than $5 in acquisition costs per user.

Square also completed the charter process to operate its own bank in March. This gives the company a full gamut of financial services it can offer in the high-margin digital banking space.

Visa

As of May 25 payment processing giant Visa (V 0.49%) was clinging the No. 10 spot with a $487 billion market cap $3 billion ahead of JPMorgan Chase. I believe in 14 years it'll still be clinging to a top-10 spot and likely pushing above a $1 trillion valuation.

Visa is a cyclical business which is a simple way of saying that it does really well when the U.S. and global economy are expanding and it struggles a bit when recession arise. However this is a numbers game Visa is well-prepared to play. Periods of expansion last significantly longer than contractions. What's more Visa isn't a lender which means it's not required to set aside cash for delinquent loans when recession strike. Thus why it bounces back so quickly from economic contractions.

With a majority of the world's transactions still conducted in cash Visa's growth runway extends decades into the future.

Berkshire Hathaway

In 14 years it's unlikely that Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are going to be running Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.61%) (BRK.B 0.60%) or dictating its investments. Thankfully Buffett has laid out a winning game plan for his successors that should result in continued growth.

Similar to the Visa growth thesis (Visa is one of Berkshire's four-dozen holdings) most of Buffett's investment portfolio is tied up in cyclical businesses. The Oracle of Omaha has always thrived on playing the numbers game and betting on multiyear periods of economic expansion. He also loves a good dividend stock which is why Coca-Cola and American Express have been so valuable.

The wildcard here will be investment lieutenants Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. If they maintain Buffett's long-term approach and avoid trying to time the market Berkshire Hathaway should be one of the 10 largest stocks come 2035.

Sea Limited

A final surprise that could find its way into the top 10 is Singapore-based Sea Limited (SE -1.14%). A veritable no-name a couple of years ago Sea has three extremely fast-growing businesses that could all help it reach a trillion-dollar valuation by 2035.

While mobile gaming is its primary generator of positive adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the time being it's e-commerce platform Shopee that'll be Sea's core sales and profit driver over the long run. ""But what about Amazon?"" you ask? Don't fret. Sea is primarily focused on emerging markets where the middle class is still taking shape. Sea and Amazon can thrive in their own separate niches.

Sea also has a nascent mobile wallet segment that could provide financial solutions to largely underbanked regions of Southeastern Asia. It has all the tools needed to be one of the world's largest companies."
MO,Altria,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzI5L21lZXQtdGhlLWFudGktbGVnYWxpemF0aW9uLWdvcC1jb25ncmVzc3dvbWFuLWNhc2hpbmctaW4tb24tbWFyaWp1YW5hLXN0b2Nrcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the anti-legalization GOP Congresswoman cashing in on marijuana stocks,"Rep. Virginia Foxx a North Carolina Republican with an influential post on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform has spent her Congressional career advocating against the legalization of marijuana — while also loading up on hundreds of thousands of dollars in marijuana-industry stocks ahead of crucial votes on key federal decriminalization measures Salon has learned.

Foxx 77 has made at least six investments in Altria one of the world's largest tobacco companies and a leader in the burgeoning U.S. cannabis industry since September of last year according to financial disclosure reports. Altria previously known as Phillip Morris also holds large minority stakes in JUUL Labs and Anheuser Busch InBev another company exploring the cannabis market.

The purchases which have not previously been reported likely make her the largest holder of marijuana-related stocks in Congress according to a report from Unusual Whales a market research firm. It's impossible to say for certain however because members of Congress are not required to disclose the exact amounts of their investments.

The trades are especially newsworthy for their timing: beginning just a few months before the U.S. House of Representatives passed the the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment & Expungement Act (MORE) in December which would serve to decriminalize cannabis at the federal level — a key goal of advocates who say the drug's current status as a controlled substance represents a key roadblock to full legalization. Foxx voted against the measure.

Her investments raise concerns over the ethical problems members of Congress create when trading individual stocks within an industry their actions have the potential to influence.

""This is so obviously a conflict of interest I'm just not sure what else I can say really"" Richard Painter a former White House ethics attorney under President George W. Bush and University of Minnesota law professor told Salon. ""It brings into question her credibility as a lawmaker.""

Rep. Foxx's office did not respond to a request for comment.

The MORE Act ultimately wasn't taken up for a vote in the then-Republican-controlled Senate effectively killing the measure. It was reintroduced in the House Friday by Rep. Jerry Nadler D-New York and has a greater chance of success given the Senate's new Democratic majority.

At least four of Foxx's investments in marijuana-industry stock came between the initial MORE Act vote in December and Friday. In all records show she has purchased somewhere between $79000 and $210000 in Altria stock. It remains unclear whether she is currently holding these investments — though no sales have been reported.

Legalization has been a hot-button issue for the North Carolina representative whose inflammatory public statements on the matter have been staunchly against several initiatives spearheaded by House Democrats.

""Democrats can't get their minds off pot bills and they think it's more important than: Supporting small businesses Safely reopening schools Protecting the livelihoods of Americans"" she wrote on Twitter. ""No wonder their majority is shrinking. They're so far removed from reality.""

""What are Republicans fighting to protect? Jobs"" she wrote in another tweet on President Joe Biden's COVID-19 relief bill. ""What are Democrats fighting to protect? Pot. What a joke.""

Though her marijuana-related investments likely dwarf other members she is far from the only Congressperson to cash in on the budding sector — at least 20 House members and six Senators have reported either purchases or sales of industry stocks since 2020 records show.

Two other representatives are notable for their significant investments in cannabis over the past year: Rep. John Yarmuth D-Kentucky and Rep. Brian Mast R-Florida.

Rep. Yarmuth a co-sponsor of the MORE Act with a powerful post as chairman of the House Budget Committee takes the record for most diversified marijuana industry portfolio in Congress — with November investments in Canopy Growth Corporation Aurora Cannabis and Tilray as well as February pickups in the same three companies public disclosures show. He has also reported past investments in at least three other industry stocks according to Unusual Whales: Cronos Group Altria and Anheuser Busch InBev whose primary business is not in marijuana but has made several recent high-profile ventures into the arena. Yarmuth remains one of the staunchest defenders of legalization in Congress.

Rep Mast was one of only five Republicans who voted to approve the MORE Act — but not before purchasing between $15000 and and $50000 in Tilray the Canadian cannabis giant disclosure reports reveal. Mast is a U.S. Army veteran who lost both his legs during an explosion in Afghanistan. He has generally supported more research into the effects of legalization and said during a town hall in 2016 that he is a ""proponent for alternative forms of medicine.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

On June 8 the merchant Web host and entertainment behemoth will automatically enroll the devices in Amazon Sidewalk. The new wireless mesh service will share a small slice of your Internet bandwidth with neighboring Sidewalk-capable devices that don’t have connectivity. Sidewalk will also help your Amazon devices to a sliver of bandwidth from other Sidewalk users when you don’t have a connection.

By default a variety of Amazon devices will enroll in the system come June 8. And since only a tiny fraction of people take the time to change default settings that means millions of people will be co-opted into the program whether they know anything about it or not. The Amazon webpage linked above says Sidewalk ""is currently only available in the US."" The full list of devices that can act as Sidewalk bridges is Ring Floodlight Cam (2019) Ring Spotlight Cam Wired (2019) Ring Spotlight Cam Mount (2019) Echo (3rd gen and newer) Echo Dot (3rd gen and newer) Echo Dot for Kids (3rd gen and newer) Echo Dot with Clock (3rd gen and newer) Echo Plus (all generations) Echo Show (all models and generations) Echo Spot Echo Studio Echo Input and Echo Flex.

The webpage also states:

What is Amazon Sidewalk? Amazon Sidewalk is a shared network that helps devices work better. Operated by Amazon at no charge to customers Sidewalk can help simplify new device setup extend the low-bandwidth working range of devices to help find pets or valuables with Tile trackers and help devices stay online even if they are outside the range of their home wifi. In the future Sidewalk will support a range of experiences from using Sidewalk-enabled devices such as smart security and lighting and diagnostics for appliances and tools. How will Amazon Sidewalk impact my personal wireless bandwidth and data usage? The maximum bandwidth of a Sidewalk Bridge to the Sidewalk server is 80Kbps which is about 1/40th of the bandwidth used to stream a typical high definition video. Today when you share your Bridge’s connection with Sidewalk total monthly data used by Sidewalk per account is capped at 500MB which is equivalent to streaming about 10 minutes of high definition video. Why should I participate in Amazon Sidewalk? Amazon Sidewalk helps your devices get connected and stay connected. For example if your Echo device loses its wifi connection Sidewalk can simplify reconnecting to your router. For select Ring devices you can continue to receive motion alerts from your Ring Security Cams and customer support can still troubleshoot problems even if your devices lose their wifi connection. Sidewalk can also extend the working range for your Sidewalk-enabled devices such as Ring smart lights pet locators or smart locks so they can stay connected and continue to work over longer distances. Amazon does not charge any fees to join Sidewalk.

Amazon has published a white paper detailing the technical underpinnings and service terms that it says will protect the privacy and security of this bold undertaking. To be fair the paper is fairly comprehensive and so far no one has pointed out specific flaws that undermine the encryption or other safeguards being put in place. But there are enough theoretical risks to give users pause.

Wireless technologies like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth have a history of being insecure. Remember WEP  the encryption scheme that protected Wi-Fi traffic from being monitored by nearby parties? It was widely used for four years before researchers exposed flaws that made decrypting data relatively easy for attackers. WPA the technology that replaced WEP is much more robust but it also

Bluetooth has had its share of similar vulnerabilities over the years too either in the Bluetooth standard or in the way it’s implemented in various products.

If industry-standard wireless technologies have such a poor track record why are we to believe a proprietary wireless scheme will have one that’s any better?

The omnipotent juggernaut

Next consider the wealth of intimate details Amazon devices are privy to. They see who knocks on our doors and in some homes they peer into our living rooms. They hear the conversations we’re having with friends and family. They control locks and other security systems in our home.

Extending the reach of all this encrypted data to the sidewalk and living rooms of neighbors requires a level of confidence that’s not warranted for a technology that has never seen widespread testing.

Last let’s not forget who’s providing this new way for everyone to share and share alike. As independent privacy researcher Ashkan Soltani puts it: “In addition to capturing everyone’s shopping habits (from amazon.com) and their internet activity (as AWS is one of the most dominant web hosting services)... now they are also effectively becoming a global ISP with a flick of a switch all without even having to lay a single foot of fiber.”

Amazon’s decision to make Sidewalk an opt-out service rather than an opt-in one is also telling. The company knows the only chance of the service gaining critical mass is to turn it on by default so that’s what it’s doing. Fortunately turning Sidewalk off is relatively painless. It involves:

No doubt the benefits of Sidewalk for some people will outweigh the risks. But for the many if not the vast majority of users there’s little upside and plenty of downside. Amazon representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Amazon first launched its health and safety program called WorkingWell earlier this month aimed at providing employees with “physical and mental activities wellness exercises and healthy eating support that are scientifically proven to help recharge and reenergize and ultimately reduce the risk of injury.” It is part of the company’s more than $300 million USD investment into workplace safety projects in 2021 as it strives to become “Earth’s Safest Place to Work.“

But one of the program’s initiatives — called AmaZen — has garnered newfound attention online for its unconventional approach to wellness. Amazon first described the method in a May 17 press release:

“AmaZen guides employees through mindfulness practices in individual interactive kiosks at buildings. During shifts employees can visit AmaZen stations and watch short videos featuring easy-to-follow wellbeing activities including guided meditations positive affirmations calming scenes with sounds and more.”

According to a now-deleted video shared by Amazon this week AmaZen kiosks have been set up across U.S. warehouses so employees can have a quiet place to go to “focus on their mental and emotional well-being.”

But the new video has prompted backlash on social media with some users calling it “dystopian.”

The deal to buy the 97-year-old Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer which has an immense library of 4000 film titles and 17000 hours of TV programming is designed to supercharge Amazon’s content pipeline which is the lifeblood of any competitor in the global battle for streaming supremacy.

As the streaming wars have intensified new entrants – such as Disney+ Sky Comcast’s Peacock and WarnerMedia’s HBO Max – are increasingly refusing to license their own crown-jewel shows and films to rivals in order to fuel their own streaming services.

Amazon has not pursued an original-content strategy in the heavyweight way that Netflix has. Just 3% of its 41000 hours of TV shows and films are originals or owned content compared with a fifth of the 39000-hour library at Netflix according to Ampere Analysis.

The greatest opportunity is with the Bond franchise. There is a huge amount of intellectual property that has not been exploited John Mass Content Partners

“It is getting harder to get library content – they’re not going to get shows like Friends now they’re locked in elsewhere” says Michael Pachter a media analyst at Wedbush. “To create 4000 movies would take them 200 years. To create 17000 hours of TV would take an eternity. They couldn’t do it fast enough. They had to buy something. The question is how much Amazon can now exploit.”

Much of the focus has been on MGM’s flagship property: James Bond. At 59 years old the evergreen screen spy is the world’s second-longest running film franchise after Godzilla and some analysts have estimated he could be worth half the near-$9bn price tag of the whole library.

Bond is a treasure trove unexploited beyond the 25 feature films focusing on its star which Amazon would dearly love to develop into a Marvel- or Star Wars-like “universe”. The only problem is that Bond is partly owned by Eon Productions in the UK which is run by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson who exercise strict control over how the character is used – even down to choosing the actor who plays him. Following the announcement of the deal they reiterated that 007’s primary home would remain the big screen saying: “We are committed to continue making James Bond films for the worldwide theatrical audience.”

Plans for one potential spin-off in 2002 – a movie based on the character Jinx played by Halle Berry in Die Another Day – were scrapped the following year while the highly successful Young Bond series of books for young adults has never made it beyond print.

“I think the greatest opportunity is with the Bond franchise” says John Mass at Content Partners a Los Angeles-based investment firm that owns the rights to content including Black Hawk Down Olympus Has Fallen and part of the CSI television franchise. “I think that ‘universe’ is probably an overused term but I do think that there is a huge amount of intellectual property that has not been exploited. What Bond has demonstrated is that the asset the brand is resilient.”

Still beyond Bond MGM – which made $1.5bn (£1bn) last year mostly from licensing its properties – has an array of valuable assets ripe for further exploitation. Rocky has been given a new lease of life with the Creed series of films starring Michael B Jordan. A second Addams Family animated film is due for release this year while a TV series is in the works at Netflix. Disney+ has an upcoming series Willow based on the 1988 Ron Howard film and a hybrid animated/live-action reboot of The Pink Panther is in the works.

Meanwhile the Russo brothers – the directors of one of the biggest-grossing film of all time Avengers: Endgame – are on board to remake several films starting with The Thomas Crown Affair; a third instalment of Legally Blonde is due next year; and CBS has psychological crime drama Clarice a TV spin-off which has its roots in The Silence of the Lambs.

But unlike MGM which was forced into bankruptcy a decade ago and currently carries about $2bn in debt Amazon has the financial firepower to supercharge the exploitation of this library. The company which has $73bn in cash on hand and a market value of $1.6 trillion spent $11bn on content last year and will lay out $15.5bn this year. It has reportedly spent $465m on its first TV series set in the world of Lord of the Rings the rights for which were secured after Amazon’s founder Jeff Bezos reportedly told executives to “find a Game of Thrones” to take the fight to Netflix the world’s leading streamer.

Observers and analysts speculate at possibilities including a remake of Thelma and Louise which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year or reviving the late-80s series Thirtysomething. Franchises including Stargate and Tomb Raider appear ripe for a major new investment while RoboCop is ready for new audiences following 2014’s disappointing remake. TV hits The Handmaid’s Tale and Fargo are currently locked in deals with Hulu and FX but are also viewed as ripe for future exploitation.

The only content off the table is some 2000 classic films including hits such as Gone with the Wind The Wizard of Oz and Singin’ in the Rain which MGM sold to Warner Bros in 1986.

“In terms of production there is a lot of intellectual property that is under-exploited from a rights standpoint” says Mass. “There are loads of potential sequels remakes and prequels in the MGM library. I’m sure MGM have done a good job with it but the streaming wars are going on and a new team of people at Amazon will uncover a lot more opportunities.”"

That often meant showing up at the gate correctly finding the aircraft mostly boarded and not having any overhead bin space left.

Some agents have even been known to skip upgrading passengers who aren’t at the gate so boarding early also has meant customers losing out on upgrades.

Gate agents do it because the earlier they start the better chance they have that the flight will push back exactly on time (and they won’t risk their stats or get yelled at for late departures). Flight attendants hate it because this means they are forced to start working earlier than they’re supposed to (and they don’t get paid extra for it).

The American Airlines flight attendants union has a grievance over boarding planes prior to scheduled departure that is pending arbitration. The case won’t be heard until the fall.

According to the union

[W]e have seen early boarding become the norm rather than the exception. Many times even after the boarding time has been established during the Departure Dependability Briefing passengers are being sent down early and before Flight Attendants are ready to receive passengers. This is unacceptable.

Attempts at mediation failed because American Airlines in the union’s words “maintains that no language in the [flight attendant contract] prohibits them from boarding early.” They believe they can keep doing it even though it’s bad for flight attendants and customers.

Sections 11.M. and 14.F. of the flight attendant contract (“JCBA”) details when a flight attendant needs to be on board so that American Airlines can begin passenger boarding of the aircraft. For domestic flights these times are

Aircraft with fewer than 165 seats board 30 minutes prior to departure



Aircraft with 165 or more seats board 35 minutes prior to departure

Boeing 737s used to have 160 seats on them (150 prior to US Airways management taking over the airline) so they boarded 30 minutes prior to departure. Now that they added seats to the aircraft to match the way they’re configuring Boeing 737 MAX planes they hold 172 passengers and board 35 minutes to departure.

American’s boarding passes used to print that boarding was 30 minutes to departure even for flights where it was 35 but they’ve fixed that issue that went on for years.

This is one issue on which I hope that the flight attendants prevail.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLXRyYW5zYXRsYW50aWMtYnVzaW5lc3MtY2xhc3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Perfect American Airlines Business Class Flight,"For our trip to Greece my mom her partner and I crossed the Atlantic on American Airlines flying from Charlotte to London. Our overall itinerary was Tampa to Charlotte to London to Athens and I booked that for 57500 American AAdvantage miles and under $30 in taxes and fees per person.

I won’t write a detailed review of the transatlantic flight since I recently reviewed American’s 777-200 business class to Hawaii so a lot of the details are similar.

Our plane from Charlotte to London

Rather I just wanted to give American credit for what I’d consider to be a legitimately solid transatlantic business class experience at least in these times. The way I view it American nailed all the basics here — a great seat solid amenities good food and friendly service. That last category can often be the toughest to get right so kudos to the crew for that.

The last time I took a transatlantic flight out of Charlotte was on US Airways in 2013 and I remember the purser on that flight to this day — Miss Peggy. She was something…

Anyway let me share the highlights of this flight below.

Reverse herringbone seats are great

We were flying an American Airlines 777-200 with Collins Aerospace reverse herringbone seats. These are comfortable seats so it doesn’t get much better than that for a 7hr55min flight. For anyone curious what transatlantic loads are like nowadays 22 of the 37 business class seats were occupied on this flight.

Solid amenities especially bedding

While not as good as United Polaris long haul bedding American’s Casper bedding is excellent with a large pillow and cozy blanket.

The Bang & Olufsen headphones are also decent for anyone who likes to use airplane inflight entertainment (which I rarely do other than to keep an eye on the map).

My flight also had American’s brand new amenity kits from Shinola which seemed mighty unremarkable to me.

Surprisingly good food

Here was the menu for our flight:

And then here was the drink list:

Service began shortly after takeoff with drinks and packaged mixed nuts. I don’t usually drink when flying with US airlines but when I saw Lanson champagne on the menu I figured I’d order a glass. I mainly just ordered it on principle — I feel like if there’s a drinkable wine option on American then you might as well seize the moment since it’s anyone’s guess when that will happen again. 😉

American continues to use plastic cups though at least the pours were generous.

American Airlines business class drinks & nuts

Dinner was served soon after takeoff and the entire dinner service was on one tray. I appreciate that American lets you pre-order your meals so you can be guaranteed that you’ll get your first choice.

Everything was served wrapped as is standard nowadays. I think I’m a fan of the one tray service on a short transatlantic flight and I almost hope it sticks around as it really expedites service.



American Airlines business class dinner

I’ve gotta say the food was very good.



American Airlines business class dinner

The starter consisted of shaved beef with lemon aioli edamame guacamole and pico de gallo. There was a packaged bread roll to go along with it which was warm and surprisingly soft.



American Airlines business class dinner appetizer

I decided to be ballsy with my main course order and selected the crab cakes with lemon chive cream sauce broccoli chipotle slaw and blistered tomatoes. While I feel like crab cakes could go very wrong on a plane they were legitimately decent — I’d be happy if I were served these at a mediocre restaurant (that’s meant to be a compliment just to be clear).



American Airlines business class dinner main course

For dessert there was a salted caramel tartlet which was also good.



American Airlines business class dinner dessert

About 75 minutes before landing breakfast was served with the choice of a continental breakfast or an omelet. I selected the continental breakfast which had a nicely varied fruit plate granola and yogurt. I skipped the croissant which was hard.

Friendly & professional service

Ultimately a crew can make or break a flight and this crew couldn’t have been lovelier. The ladies working business class were professional friendly informal playful and really seemed to enjoy their jobs and that’s always so nice to see.

Often it’s the smallest things that make a difference. For example on my United flight from Maui to Chicago a couple of weeks ago the flight attendant took meal orders as follows without any sort of greeting:

“For dinner tonight do you want grilled chicken breast rice and vegetables or cheese ravioli?”

On this flight the purser Lisa took meal orders as follows:

“Mr. Schlappig it’s nice to have you flying with us this evening. Have you had a chance to look over the menu? I see that you’ve pre-ordered the crab cakes is that still what you’d like to have?”

Airlines in the USA will never be able to compete with Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways when it comes to consistent and professional service. However what they can do is strike a great balance between being genuine fun and professional and this crew did exactly that. Kudos.

The crew took great care of my mom!

Bottom line

On a good day American Airlines can be really competitive across the Atlantic. You always get excellent flat bed seats with direct aisle access along with solid bedding. The rest of the experience is consistently inconsistent.

Fortunately on this flight we lucked out with great food excellent champagne and an absolutely lovely crew. If only American were always this good.

Oh shoot I totally forgot to mention the one thing (completely outside of the crew’s control) that ended this flight on a sour note. I’ll save that for the next post.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvYW1lcmljYXMvYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtYWxjb2hvbC1tZW1vcmlhbC1kYXktYjE4NTY3MDAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A second airline bans alcohol after customer altercations as Memorial Day weekend travel surges,"The latest headlines from our reporters across the US sent straight to your inbox each weekday Your briefing on the latest headlines from across the US Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers events and updates from The Independent.

As travel surges in the United States for Memorial Day weekend passenger misbehavior on airplanes also appears to be on the rise.

On Saturday American Airlines became the latest airline to suspend the serving of alcohol on flights after a passenger allegedly brutalized a Southwest Airlines flight attendant who suffered serious injuries and lost two teeth.

“Let me be clear: American Airlines will not tolerate assault or mistreatment of our crews” Brady Byrnes American Airlines’ head of flight service said in an internal company memo obtained by CNN.

Mr Byrnes said the airline has seen “deeply disturbing situations on board aircraft” over the past week especially as flight attendants tried to enforce the federal mandate that all passengers wear masks.

The airline says it will stop serving alcohol until at least 13 September – which is also when the mask mandate ends.

Southwest Airlines had already announced a similar ban.

“Given the recent uptick in industry-wide incidents of passenger disruptions in-flight we have made the decision to pause the previously announced restart of alcohol service onboard” a spokesperson for the airline told USA TODAY.

The number of people traveling in the US has skyrocketed this week as Americans enjoy what many consider their first post-pandemic holiday. After over a year of being told to stay home and avoid visiting relatives in person many Americans – including over half of all US adults – are now fully vaccinated and can safely roam the country.

The resulting numbers are staggering. On Friday alone the Transportation Security Administration said it screened 1.96 million people. If that figure reaches 2 million at some point this weekend – as it’s expected to – it will be the highest number of travelers per day since early March 2020 before the pandemic began.

The roads are busy as well. The American Automobile Association predicted that more than 37 million Americans will drive at least 50 miles from their homes this weekend a 60 per cent increase from last year.

Paula Twidale a spokesperson for AAA told NBC Connecticut that travel has been increasing since April when larger numbers of Americans began getting their Covid shots.

“People are just excited to get out” she told the station.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL25ld3MtYW5kLXBvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjEvMDUvYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtc291dGh3ZXN0LXBvc3Rwb25lLWFsY29ob2wtc2FsZXMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Southwest postpone serving alcohol amid spike in passenger violence.,"American Airlines and Southwest Airlines have both postponed a plan to resume alcohol sales in their main cabins amid a surge in unruly behavior by passengers that has led to an increase in violence mid-flight. American Airlines announced the decision on Saturday saying it will delay restarting alcohol sales in the main cabin at least until Sept. 13. First and business class passengers will be able to ask for alcohol but only during the flight and not before departure. American announced its decision a day after Southwest had said it was postponing its initial plan to restart alcohol sales next month at least until the end of July.

The airlines took the decision shortly after a video went viral of a woman punching a flight attendant in the face on a Southwest flight from Sacramento to San Diego. The flight attendant lost two teeth. The passenger has been charged with batter causing serious bodily injury and has been banned for life from Southwest. Although more violent than most that altercation illustrates what authorities say is an increase in unruly behavior from passengers this year. “We have just never seen anything like this” Sara Nelson the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants said. “We’ve never seen it so bad.”

Alcohol sales have largely been on pause aboard airplanes as a way to avoid contact between flight attendants and passengers and to help prevent people taking off their masks as much as possible. So far this year airlines filed around 2500 reports of unruly passengers with the Federal Aviation Administration including 1900 that had to do specifically with people refusing to wear face masks. In an internal memo to flight attendants announcing the decision American Airlines said it recognized that “alcohol can contribute to atypical behavior from customers onboard and we owe it to our crew not to potentially exacerbate what can already be a new and stressful situation for our customers.”

Southwest cited the “recent uptick industrywide of incidents in-flight involving disruptive passengers” to explain its decision. “We realize this decision will be disappointing for some customers but we feel it to be the right decision now in the interest of safety and comfort of all onboard” Southwest said in a statement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2F2ZWxvLWJyZWV6ZS1haXJsaW5lLWNvbXBhcmlzb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Budget carrier battle: America's 2 newest airlines Avelo and Breeze,"Despite the pandemic two brand-new U.S. airlines were born in a matter of weeks.

The first Avelo Airlines took off on April 28 in California. It's inaugural flight from its base in Burbank to Santa Rosa in northern California made it the first mainline U.S. carrier to launch in 15 years. The ultra-low-cost carrier has since expanded to new West Coast markets and will add its first East Coast focus city in New Haven later this year.

Less than a month later Breeze Airways took off on May 27. With a launch plan that includes 39 routes across 16 cities by July Breeze is quickly spreading its wings.

Both brand-new airlines Avelo and Breeze share some striking similarities. But they also have some noticeable differences. Let's take a look at how they stack up against each other.

Founders

Both Avelo and Breeze were founded by seasoned airline executives.

Avelo is the brainchild of Andrew Levy formerly a co-founder and president of Allegiant Air and then chief financial officer at United. He's recycling much of his Allegiant playbook in Avelo's launch plan including a network of point-to-point routes with unbundled fares.

That strategy is the same one being implemented at Breeze which was founded by serial airline entrepreneur David Neeleman who's perhaps most famous for launching New York-based JetBlue and Azul in Brazil among others and co-owning TAP in Portugal.

Neeleman's impressive track record of building successful airlines has many industry observers watching closely as he starts his latest venture in Breeze. It remains to be seen if Neeleman can pull it off again or whether Breeze will chart the same course that so many new airline startups take — failure.

For Breeze Neeleman's plan is to create a ""seriously nicer"" airline. He's trying to make travel simpler and more convenient through a robust mobile app and other tech enhancements its point-to-point route network low-cost operating model and friendly ground crew and flight attendants.

Route network

At the outset both Avelo and Breeze are taking off with similar network strategies: both airlines' route maps are dotted with point-to-point flights from focus cities or ""hubs.""

Avelo started with its first base in Burbank (BUR) an ""opportunistic"" move as the airline CEO described it. Like many secondary airports in major cities Burbank lost much of its service when carriers including Delta and JetBlue cut back there during the pandemic.

Avelo chose 11 destinations to serve from Burbank many of which are to secondary or regional airports like Ogden Utah (OGD) near Salt Lake City and Phoenix-Mesa (AZA) near the major Sky Harbor airport that is that metropolitan area's primary airport.

Only a couple of flights are operated daily as the airline is focusing mainly on the leisure and VFR (visiting friends and relatives) market.

Interestingly just days after launching Avelo Airlines announced that it's headed East. It'll make New Haven Connecticut its first base on the East Coast in the third quarter of this year with yet undisclosed routes.

For now Avelo's route map is much more localized than Breeze's one.

Breeze is ramping up much quicker than Avelo. The airline plans 39 routes primarily from four focus cities: Tampa; New Orleans; Charleston South Carolina; and Norfolk Virginia. The airline plans to have a presence in a total of 16 cities by mid-summer.

Despite Breeze's more aggressive launch the underlying network strategy is largely identical to Avelo: connect mid-sized cities that've historically been overlooked or underserved by the mainline carriers outside of their hubs. Both airlines are starting with many point-to-point flights that average under two hours.

With nonstop service Breeze hopes to woo flyers with its low fares and time savings.

For now Avelo and Breeze haven't picked any overlapping markets but that could change as both airlines keep growing in small- and medium-size airports nationwide.

One interesting difference between Avelo and Breeze is how they're tackling expansion plans. Avelo is creating a bi-coastal operation with its New Haven base while— so far — Breeze is focused on blanketing Rust Belt and Sun Belt cities with its blue jets.

However Breeze is planning to take delivery of 60 brand-new Airbus A220s which it plans to deploy on routes longer than two hours so it'll be interesting to follow the airline's expansion plans.

Fleet

At the outset Breeze is planning to become a much bigger airline than Avelo.

Avelo currently has just three Boeing 737-800 aircraft with a handful of smaller Boeing 737-700 jets slated to join the fleet later this year. The carrier plans to station the -700s at its New Haven base. Avelo's aircraft are roughly 15 years old on average.

While Breeze is also launching with older aircraft the carrier has plans to quickly modernize its fleet.

To reduce costs and get off the ground quickly Breeze is leasing 118-seat Embraer E195 jets from Azul as well as 108-seat E190s from Nordic Aviation Capital. These planes are roughly 11 years old on average.

Adding these older jets to the Breeze fleet was a deliberate choice on Neeleman's part. ""Because the [older Embraers] are being obsoleted somewhat we can get parts for really cheap cents on the dollar so maintenance costs are low"" he said in an interview with TPG.

However the carrier will modernize the fleet quickly. Later this year Breeze is expecting the first of its 60 new Airbus A220-300 jets which can hold up to 160 passengers and will be deployed on longer routes. Neeleman said he expects the first delivery in October with one delivery a month after that through the next few years.

Fares and fees

Avelo's fare structure is much simpler than Breeze's.

With Avelo there's just one unbundled fare option. Some routes start at just $19 and you'll need to pay for everything else. Seat selection starts at $4 full-size carry-on bags cost $35 and the first and second checked bag cost $20 and $30 respectively.

Avelo offers just a single coach cabin on its Boeing 737s and has no publicly stated plans to install a biz or first-class product on its jets.

Breeze on the other hand has a more robust fare structure. The carrier offers two economy-class options ""Nice"" and ""Nicer."" The former is equivalent to an Avelo fare — you'll have to pay for all your ancillary services.

Seat assignments start at $10 full-size carry-on along with the first and second checked bag cost $20 each ($25 for flights longer than three hours).

The carrier's ""Nicer"" fare includes an extra-legroom seat (which costs $20 to $50 when paired with an entry-level ""Nice"" fare) a full-size carry-on bag one checked bag a drink snack and priority boarding.

Breeze is planning to launch a first-class cabin on its Airbus A220 jets which will fall under the airline's ""Nicest"" fare bucket.

Notably neither Avelo nor Breeze charge any change or cancel fees — you can make voluntary modifications to your plans at any time before departure. You'll receive a travel credit if you decide to cancel and will be on the hook for a possible fare difference if you switch to a more expensive flight.

Onboard experience

While both Avelo and Breeze are low-cost carriers the latter definitely plans to offer a more comfortable inflight experience.

For one Avelo's Boeing 737s are outfitted in a tight configuration. The slimline seats sport just 29 inches of pitch. Avelo chose the Acro Series 6 seats — the same as you'll find on Spirit's newest jets — which feature a built-in curve around the hip level for two additional inches of knee space.

Despite these so-called improvements I'd personally avoid these seats entirely for flights longer than two hours. They're both tight and poorly padded.

If you're looking for some more space there are 60 extra-legroom seats located in the forward section of the cabin spanning rows 1 to 8 and 22 to 24 as well as the exit rows 20 and 21.

These can be purchased for $15 and up. Extra-legroom seats sport between 32 and 35 inches of pitch offering a much more comfortable ride.

While Avelo's seats currently recline Levy told TPG that the current plan is to lock the seats in a pre-reclined position to avoid making it an extra-tight squeeze for those trying to get up during the flight.

Compared to Avelo's cabins it's a pleasure to fly with Breeze. Neeleman's airline chose comfortable and well-padded leather seats for its all-coach cabins.

On the Embraer 195 the standard seats have 31 inches of pitch. The smaller E190s have 29 inches — the same as Avelo — but the leather padding should make them noticeably more comfortable.

Breeze's seats measure 17.6 inches wide making them more comfortable than the ones on Avelo. Additionally thanks to the E-jets' 2-2 configuration there are (currently) no middle seats on Breeze. (The airline's A220s will likely feature one middle seat per row in a 2-3 arrangement.)

Neither Avelo nor Breeze currently offers any inflight entertainment power outlets or Wi-Fi.

Avelo has plans to install Wi-Fi but there's no timeline on its progress.

Breeze will add streaming inflight entertainment to its Embraer jets and it'll also install Wi-Fi on its A220s since they'll operate longer flights. (It's unclear if Breeze will also install power outlets on the A220s.)

As for inflight service both Avelo and Breeze are currently offering a small snack pack for flyers due to the pandemic. Avelo's snack packs include a water bottle and Lorna Doone shortbread cookies while Breeze passengers get a small bottle of water and a choice of either Utz potato chips or a mini-Kind bar.

Both carriers are planning to introduce an extensive buy-on-board program once the pandemic ends.

Bottom line

Avelo and Breeze are America's two newest airlines that launched just weeks apart.

While they're both low-cost carriers there are some notable differences between the two. Breeze is planning a much faster expansion — both in terms of its route network and fleet size. Additionally Breeze's jets are outfitted in a much more comfortable layout.

Despite the differences they share an underlying strategy: serve America's small and mid-sized cities with nonstop air service at low fares — and then charge for everything else.

Created in 1971 from the creaking remains of the classic US railroads that helped build modern America Amtrak has often lived a precarious existence.

Subject to the whims of politicians in Washington D.C. and constantly under pressure from the well-funded and hugely influential oil automotive and airline industry lobbies the national passenger rail operator has been threatened with oblivion on several occasions.

But as it celebrates a 50th anniversary that few would have been brave enough to predict there are signs that Amtrak’s moment may finally have arrived.

The United States remains firmly wedded to the automobile and the sheer size of the nation means that air travel is often the only option for long-distance journeys.

Yet dotted across the country are numerous routes where population density and distances make rail a viable option – and a social necessity.

That’s not news – those routes have existed since the earliest days of the railroads. What is novel is the renewed enthusiasm of Americans for commuting or taking long-distance leisure trips by train.

What is most significant right now is the presence of a passionate Amtrak advocate in the White House.

President Joe Biden a long-time rail commuter rejoicing in the nickname “Amtrak Joe” is calling on Congress to invest $80 billion in the rail network.

This massive chunk of change is needed to address Amtrak’s repair backlog; modernize the flagship Northeast Corridor; improve existing corridors create new intercity connections; and enhance grant and loan programs that support passenger and freight rail safety efficiency and electrification.

Battered remnants

Amtrak has already secured $1.7 billion in federal funding under the “American Rescue Plan” to stimulate its recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic including reinstating suspended services and returning around 1200 staff from furlough over the next two years.

But finding the rest of the money Biden wants to transform passenger rail will require a huge political effort in Washington and across the nation and a level of cross-party support for railroads not seen for many decades.

Speaking at Philadelphia’s 30th Street station at an event to celebrate Amtrak’s anniversary on April 30 Biden spoke of being a proud member of the the rail network’s “family.”



“Amtrak doesn’t just carry us from one place to another it opens up enormous opportunities and it will make it possible to build the economy that we need” he said. “The expansion of rail provides the well-paid jobs that we need in America. We can’t just build back we have to build back better; Amtrak and intercity rail will play a central part in that.”

There was no celebration when Amtrak’s first train rolled out of New York City on May 1 1971 heading for Philadelphia.

Passenger rail in the United States was in its death throes. Once proud railroads such as the New York Central and Pennsylvania RR went bankrupt after years of huge losses their trains dated dirty and unable to compete with the speed comfort and modernity of airliners intercity buses and contemporary cars.

City center stations not always in the best part of town were dirty dingy and dangerous with years of neglect and rising crime providing a further deterrent to passengers.

Amtrak’s challenge was to knit together a disjointed collection of battered remnants focusing its attention on saving the most viable routes.

With a country as large as the United States a coherent national passenger rail network of the type found in Europe and Japan was never a practical prospect.

Instead busy corridors such as Boston-New York-Washington D.C. would sit alongside a network of low-frequency (daily or less) long-distance services aimed at leisure travelers.

In some cases these trains were also necessary to maintain communications with communities that had grown up alongside the railroad – although countless towns were still abandoned as passenger rail services contracted in the 1950s and 1960s.

New trains faster speeds

Today Amtrak serves more than 500 destinations in 46 US states the District of Columbia and three Canadian provinces on a network of more than 21400 miles.

In 2019 despite repeated threats to its existence and the prospect of swingeing budget cuts in every year of the Trump administration the company posted its best-ever results.

Between 2015 and 2019 annual operating losses fell from $306.5 million to just $29.8 million as new records were set for ridership and revenue.

Operational breakeven was forecast for 2020 until the pandemic caused ridership to drop by almost 50%.

Despite that sudden and traumatic intervention the overall trend of the last decade is growth especially on the profitable Northeast Corridor or NEC linking Boston New York City Philadelphia Baltimore and Washington D.C.

In his April 30 speech Biden said: “A single day without the Northeast Corridor would cost the US economy $100 million and we’d have to add an extra seven lanes to the interstate to accommodate all the extra cars if it wasn’t there. Compared to the alternatives this railroad is the bargain of bargains.”

Since the turn of the century Amtrak has seen ridership increase in the corridor as a result of its 150 miles-per-hour Acela trains – introduced in 2000 – as well as road congestion and steadily rising gasoline prices.

In 2022 the next generation of Acelas will enter service on the NEC. Built in the United States by global rail engineering giant Alstom the 28 Avelia Liberty trains are derived from the latest iteration of France’s high-speed TGV trains.

Fitted with tilting bodies to allow faster travel through curves and capable of 160 miles-per-hour in everyday service the new trains offer the possibility of further acceleration to 186 miles-per-hour once the infrastructure allows it.

Compared to the trains they will replace the new $2.4 billion Acela fleet is bigger with eight additional trains (28 rather than 20) allowing a more frequent service with more seats per train.

‘Enjoyable and efficient’

Prototype trains started testing at the Federal Railroad Administration’s test center in Pueblo Colorado and on the NEC in 2020. By the end of that year the trains had completed 20000 miles of tests reaching a maximum speed of 166.8 miles-per-hour at Pueblo.

On April 21 another huge investment in new hardware was unveiled when a contract for 83 hybrid electro-diesel train sets was awarded to Siemens.

Intended to replace almost 500 of the classic stainless steel Amfleet I cars dating from the mid-1970s the new Intercity Trainsets will feature locomotives capable of working on diesel or electric power and comfortable new Venture passenger cars.

The trains are expected to be similar to those now being delivered by Siemens for the Chicago-Milwaukee Hiawatha service. They will be deployed on medium-distance NEC services the Palmetto between New York City and Savannah Georgia and on the Portland-Seattle-Vancouver ‘Cascades’ route.

“This new state-of-the-art equipment will not only provide Amtrak customers with an enjoyable and efficient travel experience it will also enable us to improve safety increase passenger capacity and reduce carbon emissions” commented Amtrak CEO Bill Flynn.

More Venture cars are also on order to replace life-expired vehicles on state-supported services in the Midwest and California including 97 cars for routes radiating from Chicago to cities in Illinois Michigan Missouri and Wisconsin and 49 for the Bakersfield-Oakland/Sacramento San Joaquins.

‘The real America’

Long-distance routes such as the Seattle-Los Angeles Coast Starlight and Chicago-San Francisco Southwest Chief will also gain new equipment for the first time in over two decades this year when 4200 horsepower Charger locomotives and 130 new Viewliner II sleeping dining and baggage cars start to be rolled out.

While the long-distance routes are unlikely to play a significant role in US transportation needs they are a valuable asset for tourism and the often-isolated communities they serve.

Sean Jeans-Gail vice-president of government affairs and policy at the US Rail Passengers Association highlights the network’s potential to give travelers a real connection to the nation it criss-crosses.

“We have an extraordinary beautiful country but the ‘Great American Road Trip’ is on life support because when you do it you hit traffic and the same homogenized strip malls over and over again across the highway network” he tells CNN.

“If you really want to see the real America Amtrak is better.”

Intercity and interurban routes away from the NEC offer Amtrak the greatest opportunity for growth in the coming years.

Airlines have slashed back regional flights of around 300-400 miles in recent years leaving many cities such as Memphis and Cincinnati with poor communications.

These routes offer huge potential for rail which is competitive with air for journeys of three to four hours between city centers while at the same time transforming connectivity for towns in between.

Jim Mathews president and CEO of the US Rail Passengers Association says these factors present a strong case for reversing the dismantling of rail services and enhancing links between rural and urban centers.

He says transportation planners and the Department of Transport are coming around to this way of thinking looking at shifting populations and how they create new travel patterns particularly in the Midwest and Southeast.

But he says although America could be on the brink of a rail revolution it is unlikely to be traveling at any great velocity.

“A lot of us are guilty of getting zeroed in on the shiny object” he tells CNN. “Sure TGV [high-speed rail] would be cool but it’s not necessary to see dramatic improvements in rail travel.

“With targeted investment in track straightening curves or new signaling you could get average speeds of up to 79 miles-per-hour. There are places now where the average is 25!”

In his April 30 speech Biden said his spending plans were crucial to leveling up America on the global stage.

“I propose spending $10 billion a year on passenger and freight rail repairing this vital infrastructure and expanding passenger rail services” he said. “It’s going to provide jobs and accommodate jobs – towns that have been left behind will be back in the game if we can provide them with fast clean safe infrastructure.

“We’re way behind the rest of the world on this now and we have to move if we’re going to compete with the likes of China. There’s so much we can do and it can have an incredibly positive impact on jobs and the environment but we have to invest now.”

‘Worthwhile ambition’

Republicans have proposed an alternative infrastructure plan costed at $538 billion just $20 billion of which would be dedicated to rail improvements. Amtrak estimates that the Northeast Corridor alone requires $31 billion to overcome a repairs backlog.

Much-needed investment in equipment is also being accompanied by federal spending on infrastructure as part of President Biden’s $621 billion American Jobs Plan but there’s also increasing support at state level.

In late March Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and Virginia Governor Ralph Northam outlined a 10-year program to expand intercity and regional rail services across the state.

As well as investing in infrastructure improvements Virginia also plans to double its financial support for Amtrak’s Washington-Richmond intercity route allowing a near-hourly service to operate and commuter rail operations could increase by up to 60%.

More than 200 miles of little-used abandoned or freight-only lines could also be acquired at a cost of $3.7 billion to allow the reinstatement and expansion of intercity and regional rail services across the state.

“I think there’s support coalescing both on left and right for investment in rail and I’m confident that the Biden team sees it as a worthwhile ambition for the current administration” Mathews adds.

“They’ve talked about more electrification for rail a nod to the ‘Green New Deal’ but also an important preparatory step for high-speed rail. One thing we’re terrible at compared with Europe is the lack of electrified railroads.

“There are limitations that come with that but I can see much more robust electrification in California which is preparing for high-speed rail.

“Californian electrification would have benefits for the environment speed and maintenance and I can see the Biden administration going very solidly for it.”

Fifty years on from US rail’s darkest days the stars seem to be aligning for Amtrak at last.

And while it will always be at the mercy of shifting political priorities and competing interests there is a growing recognition that the world’s richest nation can no longer get by with a public transportation system that many regard as unfit for purpose.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvYTM2NTI0NDc1L3NwaW4tYWNyb3NzLXRoZS13ZXN0LWFpcnN0cmVhbS10b3cv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Spin Across the West with an Airstream in Tow,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a36524475/spin-across-the-west-airstream-tow/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvYTM2NTI0NDc1L3NwaW4tYWNyb3NzLXRoZS13ZXN0LWFpcnN0cmVhbS10b3cv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS9hbGZhLXJvbWVvLXBhbGFkZS1oZXJlcy1ldmVyeXRoaW5nLXdlLWtub3ctYWJvdXQtdGhlLXN0eWxpc2gtZWxlY3RyaWMtYmFieS1zdXYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Alfa Romeo Palade: Here's Everything We Know About The Stylish Electric Baby SUV,"Alfa's turnaround hopes rest largely on the success of an entry-level SUV that's the brand's first EV and a brother to Jeep's upcoming junior Renegade

These speculative illustrations are made by Jean Francois Hubert/SB-Medien for CarScoops. They are not related to or endorsed by Alfa Romeo.

Alfa Romeo is on life support and it’s going to need more than glowing reviews for the limited edition Giulia GTAm to stop it flatlining. Combined sales across Alfa’s meager model lines dropped to a pathetic 35718 in 2020 which really is as bad as it sounds – Porsche sold 34328 911s alone in the same period.

And that can’t all be blamed on Covid: sales were already sliding long before anyone in China got sick. Stellantis has given the brand 10 years to turn things around. And a new baby SUV is one of the key ways it hopes to do it.

Current Situation

One of the reasons Alfa is tanking is that it desperately needs fresh product. The Punto-based Mito died back in early 2019 and the Giulietta hatch shuffled off in 2020 leaving only the handsome but slow-selling Giulia sedan and the Stelvio SUV. The decision to axe the planned GTV coupe was a blow but it’s not like it could save the brand. Alfa dealers are crying out for two things: smaller SUVs and electric power. And fortunately – finally – both are on the way.

Images of what are believed to be an early prototype of the production Tonale compact SUV leaked back in 2019

First to arrive is the Tonale which Alfa hopes will pinch sales from the BMW X1 and Audi Q3. Looking much like the 2019 concept and so a heap better than the BMW X1 it will come with a choice of conventional ICE engines or as a PHEV making it Alfa’s first electrified car when it lands in showrooms in the middle of the decade.

Alfa Romeo’s First EV

The Tonale will come with plug-in power but not as an EV. That honor goes to a baby SUV due later in the decade. The Stelvio and Tonale are named after large and medium sized Alpine peaks so we’re calling this one Palade after one of the smaller ones though Alfa is keeping tight-lipped about both the actual badge and concrete technical details for the Audi Q2 rival.

Peugeot’s 2008 also uses the CMP platform

No sweat; we already know plenty about it. We know for instance that it will ride on the Peugeot-Citroën eCMP platform Alfa Romeo gained access to when PSA merged with FCA to form Stellantis. This is the same platform already used on a stack of small front-wheel drive hatchbacks and SUVs including the Peugeot 208 and 2008 DS 3 Crossback and Opel Corsa and Mokka and would give the Alfa a wheelbase of around 2600 mm (102.3 inches).

But unlike those cars the Alfa should offer the choice of front- and all-wheel drive with power to the rear axle coming from an electric motor. Jeep’s new sub-Renegade baby SUV and a small Fiat similar to the 2019 Centoventi concept will also share that configuration and be built at the same Tychy plant in Poland.

Electric Gasoline And Possibly Diesel Too

The existing CMP cars offer both conventional ICE and EV power options and it’s very likely Alfa will do the same. That means we can expect to see the PSA turbocharged 1.2-liter triple doing its thing in various states of tune. Given Alfa’s sporty image and the fact that Audi’s Q2 range kicks off at 109 hp it might skip the 98 hp PSA motor and only offer the 128 hp and 153 hp derivatives. They’re likely to come with a choice of six-speed manual or eight-speed auto on the milder tune and a mandatory auto ‘box on the quicker version.

The Audi Q2 that’s not offered in America is a prime rival in the premium small SUV segment

And since diesel still has fans in Europe it’s possible but not certain that the Palade might also be offered with the PSA 118 hp 1.5 diesel available in the Peugeot 2008. What’s not clear is if we’ll see a really hot baby Alfa. Audi’s Q2 is available with all-wheel drive and 296 hp as an SQ2 so a petrol-electric mini Quadrifloglio would make an appealing halo model although Alfa has already ruled out a high performance Tonale.

But all eyes will be on the EV version Alfa Romeo’s first electric car. If its spec matches the e2008’s the EV will be powered by a 134 hp electric motor mounted up front and sending its power along with 192 lb ft of torque exclusively to the front wheels. A 50 kWh battery should be enough for around 200 miles (320 km) of driving range and the Palade should be able to crack 62 mph (100 km/h) in 8.5 seconds. But if the Alfa is configured to offer electric power to the rear axle on hybrid models it could also be configured as an all-wheel drive EV with a motor at either end and offer far more performance than the e2008 and Opel Mokka.

We understand the EV won’t make a fake engine noise but will have a sound synthesizer that drivers will be able to switch on and off.

What Will It Look Like?

Alfa Romeo presented the larger Tonale Concept compact SUV at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show

Unlike the Tonale which Alfa previewed with a concept back in 2019 (pictured above) there have been no design studies directly hinting at how the baby SUV might look. But there have been a few clues.

“A family feel will be respected – we have style themes across the range” an Alfa Romeo spokesman said of the new SUV when talking to Autocar in 2020. “But we don’t want to do a copy and paste across the line-up because every segment has its own personality and customers are different in terms of age and expectations.”

Those customers the Alfa guy referred to for the baby SUV are likely to be significantly younger than those buying the Tonale or Stelvio. And that means they’re probably more open to bolder funkier designs so it’s likely Alfa will get braver with the baby SUV’s styling than it did with the Tonale which was toned-down for production.

But even if it isn’t a carbon-copy of the Tonale or Stelvio we can expect Alfa’s familiar design staples – the heart-shaped grille and slim lamps – to make an appearance and make the newcomer easily recognizable.

Driver-Focused Interior

Although the Opel Mokka DS 3 Crossabck and Peugeot 2008 share the same platform you’d struggle to guess from behind the wheel. The Mokka’s Mr Sensible here its instrument panel sweeping into the infotainment screen while the 2008’s gauge pack is mounted above the wheel which takes some getting used to.

Leaked image of a production prototype of the Alfa Romeo Tonale

But we’d expect the Alfa to look more like this leaked photo of the Tonale with Alfa’s familiar 1960s-style double-bubble instrument cluster.

When Is It Coming?

According to information from Stellantis’s Polish arm that country’s FCA facility in Tychy has received $206 million of investment to prepare it for the production of three new EV-capable B-segment SUVs. The first one off the line is understood to be the new baby Jeep that will slot below the Renegade while its Fiat and Alfa cousins will follow close behind. If that info holds we should see the Alfa on the streets before the end of 2025 in ICE form and as an EV from early 2026.

But which streets? European ones certainly but it’s not clear yet whether Alfa will bring its smallest car to North America. As for prices it’s all educated guesswork at this stage but Audi’s Q2 – which isn’t offered in the US – starts at around £24000 in the UK ($33800) and we’d expect Alfa to be taking its lead from there.

Do you think Alfa’s baby SUV plans will save the legendary name from going to the wall? Let us know in the comments."

This idea is that by combining the buying power of airlines and GBT’s corporate business travel customers it will drive this increase in the production and usage of SAF.

Most corporates now have targets around reducing their emissions yet need a proportion of their employees to return to business travel to drive their economic growth. Options to reduce the emissions from air travel are limited however since lower or zero carbon technologies such as hydrogen and electric flight are decades away and offsetting is problematic.

Many corporates therefore see SAF as the only viable in-sector option for reducing emissions in the short to medium term.

As background SAF can be made from a variety of feedstocks and a number of different technology pathways and campaigners are determined that feedstock should not come from productive farmland but instead should be from waste materials and synthetic e-kerosene. At present SAF less than 0.1 per cent of aviation fuel used and is produced using one technology type.

Shell is facing the challenge of delivering on its target of being a net-zero emissions company by 2050 and increased pressure from the Dutch courts to accelerate its progress.

Shell says it is “Working with our customers and other sectors to accelerate the transition to net-zero emissions” and initiatives such as this with Amex GBT is part of this.

Anna Mascolo President Shell Aviation said: “We want to help decarbonise the aviation sector and believe this collaboration could deliver new solutions for our customers to reach net-zero emissions…. Even if all publicly announced projects today actually materialize SAF would still account for just one percent of the jet fuel market by 2030. If the aviation sector wants more SAF by 2025 significant new investments are needed today. This collaboration with GBT aims to create the environment that supports new investment in SAF production and new technologies.”

GBT Chief Executive Paul Abbott said: “We believe aggregating corporate and airline demand is the most efficient way to drive the volume of investment needed to bring change at scale. By working with Shell we aim to enable corporations and airlines to plot a course towards their own emissions targets while acting as climate leaders and creating real change.”

Providing a $100 discount on the $550 annual fee of the Chase Sapphire Reserve is identical to what they did last spring – of course lets not forget that they previously raised the price by $100 as well so this goodwill credit just resets the annual fee to $450.

Following similar decisions from other card issuers like Amex this is a logical decision from Chase and likely based on their fears and data that people will start cancelling these expensive premium cards in the current economic climate. New applicants will pay the $550 fee regardless.

ADVERTISEMENT

Here is their message:

With the new annual fee of US$550 the card is on the same level as the American Express Platinum (Amex is rumored to increase the price of the Platinum this summer) but without the value added benefit of airport lounges and (let’s face it) the prestige that still comes with an Amex Platinum card. In other words: The $550 price is too expensive for the Reserve which is a Visa Infinite.

American Express has provided relief by offering their card members various credits for dining streaming and cellphone services as well as a monthly US$30 PayPal credit. Some people have reported rather generous retention credits for calling in and asking for them. Note that Amex typically provides retention offers only every two years you can’t get those back to back.

The Sapphire Reserve does however come with an extremely flexible $300 travel credit that is pretty much as good as cash. It’s good for public transport taxis UBER/Lyft and can – as an exception during these times – also be used for grocery and gas purchases during 2021.

I’m usually rather critical of the associated benefit credits on these cards such as in the case of the CSR the DoorDash/Lyft memberships and credit as well as the Peloton Fitness credit. I use none of these and while I realize everyone’s situation is different these credits are always like “putting lipstick on a pig” so to say. In the end what matters is how much do you pay in cold cash each year and how much do you get in cash value back.

I’d argue that everyone needs to shop at the supermarket get gas or use some form of transportation so these $300 Chase provides in credits take the blow off the $450 price tag. Primary rental car insurance and the Priority Pass make up for the rest not even counting the decent point accrual rates and “Pay Yourself Back” redemption feature.

At $550 I’d think twice about this card though and probably just downgrade to the Preferred. The downside: With $95 for the Sapphire Preferred you essentially just have the card and rental car insurance nothing else. This makes keeping the Reserve right now a zero sum game for as long as they renew it at $450 per year.

Conclusion

Maybe some of our readers can chime in and tell if they received this bonus email as well. In case you haven’t received the email and are due for renewal in the next few weeks it doesn’t hurt to call and ask.

At $450 I’ll definitely keep the CSR card active considering I’m getting $300 back in flexible credits. I wasn’t sure to keep it at $550. Let’s see how this year goes in terms of spending last year I put the majority of my spend on the CSR.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9mYW1pbHktZnJpZW5kbHktYWxsLWluY2x1c2l2ZS1yZXNvcnRzLXlvdS1jYW4tYm9vay13aXRoLXBvaW50cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,11 all-inclusive beach resorts you can book with points,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available. View the current offers here.

When it comes to family vacations the beach is best. Staying at a high-end hotel in a city is great but I find that it's usually just a place to rest between explorations. When I travel with two young kids a beach vacation with a pool kids activity center and food right at hand make for a perfect holiday.

The main problem with many Caribbean and Mexican resorts is that the cost of the food can add up. I cringe when I see my bill at the end of the trip knowing that the kids probably didn't eat half of what we purchased. Feeding a family of four (including drinks for the adults) is no joking matter. My ""free"" vacation using points and miles does not end up anywhere close to free.

The high cost of feeding a family on vacation makes using points for an all-inclusive resort appealing. Some properties charge more after the first two adults but the cost is typically minimal. So if you're looking to get away for an all-inclusive vacation here are 11 properties in the sunny Caribbean and Mexico where you can use hotel points.

The Hyatt Ziva Rose Hall is just 10 minutes from Sangster International Airport (MBJ). The resort includes two separate pool areas — one for relaxation and one with activities including a swim-up bar. You can participate in anything from dance lessons on the pool deck to water ping-pong. There are many beach activities as well all included such as kayaking boogie-boarding and snorkeling. There is a sister resort nearby the Hyatt Zilara Rose Hall which is an adults-only resort.

There are eight choices for dining including a buffet Italian restaurant Asian restaurant steakhouse jerk shack beach grill pub deli and beachfront grill. That's on top of four different bars for a variety of drinks and beach cocktails.

Hilton Rose Hall Resort & Spa in Montego Bay Jamaica

(Photo by Benji Stawski/The Points Guy)

The Hilton Rose Hall Resort & Spa also in Montego Bay offers a private beach and multiple pools. Plus the resort includes access to its Sugar Mill Falls Water Park for all guests. This waterpark features a 280-foot slide and a lazy river. In short having a waterpark onsite is a huge perk. This resort also offers tennis (and tennis lessons) a kids club a teen zone and nightly entertainment.

There are lots of dining options from casual to fine dining. Plus there are bars a coffee shop and even a swim-up bar with food and drinks. Unfortunately room service is not part of the all-inclusive experience. I like ordering room service while the kids are getting ready for the day and I wouldn't want to pay for it when I can get the same food for free elsewhere on the property.

A free night at this property typically ranges between 62000 to 70000 Hilton Honors points for a double-occupancy standard room. However availability is sparse for some dates -- especially if you want to book a standard room award. Check out our post on 16 ways to earn more Hilton Honors points for tips if you need more points for your redemption.

You can have up to four guests per room but will need to pay extra at check-in if your third or fourth guest is over the age of five. The fee is $75 per night for ages 6-14 and $99 per night for ages 15 and up. However some reports show that guests were not charged any additional fee for kids in the room when staying on points reservations. Not having to pay extra guest fees could be a considerable saving when staying as a family.

Also if you have Silver Gold or Diamond Hilton status you'll receive your fifth night free when redeeming points. Having status with Hilton is easy since all of the Hilton credit cards including the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass® Card Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card and Hilton Honors American Express Card give you automatic elite status.

Holiday Inn Resort Montego Bay in Montego Bay Jamaica

The Holiday Inn Resort Montego Bay is another all-inclusive property in Montego Bay where you can use your hotel points. Although you might not equate a Holiday Inn property with a nice resort this hotel receives excellent reviews. And many travelers with IHG Platinum elite status have even reported being upgraded to a one-bedroom suite. Onsite there are kids' activities and a spa for adults. Plus this resort is one of the few on this list with a casino.

Related: Best points hotels in the Caribbean

This resort is closed until June 12 2021 and there's no availability until June 27 2021. But once it reopens you'll typically need to pay 50000 IHG Rewards Club points per night for double occupancy. However note that cash rates are low for some dates.

(Screenshot courtesy of IHG)

It is one of the few properties where kids 12 and under stay for free — no extra points or cash required — so you can maximize your IHG Rewards Club points. However you'll need to pay an $80 surcharge per person for the third and fourth adults in a room.

If you have the IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card or the IHG One Rewards Traveler Credit Card you can get a fourth-night reward when you redeem IHG Rewards points for a stay of three or more nights. If you need to earn more IHG Rewards Club points you can transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards to your IHG account or wait for a good IHG buy points sale.

Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana in Punta Cana Dominican Republic

The Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana opened in late 2019 after some delays. Most guests say the resort is beautiful and some guests even recommend it over the Hyatt Ziva Cancun. It's a great place to stay on points in Punta Cana. And for an adults-only vacation the Hyatt Zilara Cap Cana is right next door.

This resort should be on your family's radar. The hotel is only 10 minutes away from the airport (PUJ) and boasts multiple pools a lazy river and three water slides. There are 12 restaurants and bars a swim-up bar a kids club and live entertainment.

A standard room which you can reserve with points is over 600 square feet. This property costs 25000 World of Hyatt points for the first two guests plus 12500 points per additional guest in the room. As at all other Hyatt Ziva properties children two and under are free.

If you need to earn more Hyatt points for your stay you have ample opportunities. For example you could sign-up for the World of Hyatt Credit Card (or spend on your card if you already have a World of Hyatt Card). You could also buy Hyatt points or transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points to Hyatt.

Hilton La Romana in La Romana Dominican Republic

The Hilton La Romana is just 20 minutes away from La Romana Airport (LRM) and 45 minutes from Punta Cana Airport. The property is on Bayahibe Beach with calm crystal-clear waters. And there's an adjacent sister resort that carries the same name but is adult-only -- so make sure you book the right property for your stay.

The family-friendly property features five restaurants on-site a kids club a teens club a casino and a waterpark with slides and a lazy river. This property typically costs between 45000 and 68000 points a night for a standard room with double occupancy.

(Screenshot courtesy of Hilton)

However beware that availability is sparse for standard rooms during select periods. And only kids two and under stay for free. After the first two guests the resort will charge an additional $60 per night per child age three through 12 and an additional $90 per guest 13 and older.

Emotions All Inclusive Puerto Plata in Playa Dorada Dominican Republic

Emotions All-Inclusive Puerto Plata. (Photo by JT Genter/The Points Guy)

The Emotions All-Inclusive Puerto Plata resort belongs to Choice Privileges' Ascend Hotel Collection. Ascend Collection properties vary greatly but this hotel is by no means the fanciest all-inclusive on the list. However just 15 minutes away from Puerto Plata International Airport (POP) this hotel is very convenient if you can find flights into this smaller airport.

Choice Privileges changes the award pricing for its properties every few months. So although this property cost only 8000 Choice Privileges points per night when TPG senior writer Katie Genter and her husband stayed at this all-inclusive resort for a month it now costs 30000 Choice Privileges points per night. Based on TPG's valuations this is worth about $180 a night -- but you can typically find paid rates much less expensive. Choice caps rooms on points at a maximum of four guests per room.

Hyatt Ziva Cancun in Cancun Mexico

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

The Hyatt Ziva Cancun is probably the nicest all-inclusive property at which you can use your points. And its suites — like the Pyramid Suite category — are especially lovely for families that need more space.

This property is at one end of the Hotel Zone of Punta Cancun with a beach on both sides. There is no reason to leave the hotel but the location allows you to walk easily to many restaurants and shops nearby. The resort features three infinity pools two separate beach areas and complimentary pool cabanas. There are lots of daily activities on the pool deck. Plus there are kayaks stand-up paddleboards and snorkeling gear at the beach.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

There is food and drink everywhere with eight restaurants three lounges and six bars. There is truly something for everyone from sit-down fine dining to an on-the-go food truck. I've been to this property three times with my family and the food offerings are just right.

Your children will love the kids club area with games arts and crafts video games movies and disco parties. There is also a fantastic pool area with a few different play structures slides and waterfalls.

Like the Hyatt Ziva Montego Bay and Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana this hotel costs 25000 World of Hyatt points a night for double occupancy.

(Screenshot courtesy of Hyatt)

Kids two and under stay for free but other extra adults or children will cost 12500 points a night. Check out our guide on how to quickly stock up on Hyatt points if you need more Hyatt points.

Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta in Puerto Vallarta Mexico

(Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy)

The Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta is on the south side in Conchas Chinas the quieter side of Puerto Vallarta. So you will not see as many vendors and outside tourists on the beach. And you are only a short taxi ride into Old Town. The hotel includes seven (yes seven!) pools — five infinity pools and two kid-friendly options.

What is great about this property is that every single room has an ocean view. Some rooms even have hot tubs on the balconies. And if your kids are old enough you can ask about staying in one of the swim-up rooms where you can walk right outside and into the pool.

View from a room's balcony. (Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy)

As with all Hyatt all-inclusive properties your minifridge is stocked with drinks and snacks — again all complimentary. Room service will even replenish your fridge every day. Room service is also available for no additional fee throughout the day.

Families can enjoy the kids club an oceanfront fitness center the spa and many food and beverage options. There are food and beverage carts around the property to ensure you are never hungry possibly the hotel's best feature.

(Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy)

This property only requires 20000 World of Hyatt points per night for double occupancy 5000 points less than the Hyatt Ziva Cancun Hyatt Ziva Montego Bay or Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana. This pricing is a steal; this all-inclusive property can easily be $600 a night during peak times.

Kids 2 and under stay for free but additional guests will cost another 10000 points per night.

Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos in Los Cabos Mexico

(Photo by Melanie Lieberman/The Points Guy)

The Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos is located in San Jose Del Cabo which means you are closer to the airport but farther away from the nightlife. The property is located right on the beach in Cabo which makes it great for building sandcastles. But there can be a strong riptide. Swimming in the ocean is typically not recommended -- but there is a beautiful infinity pool.

The kids club is excellent with activities inside the club and at the pool right outside. The kids club pool includes a mini-waterpark with five slides. There is also a playground with a jungle gym and motorized minicars. Having a playground at a resort is special.

(Photo by Melanie Lieberman/The Points Guy)

When using points you can book either a Master King or Master Double. These large 584-square-foot rooms have pull-out couches so there is plenty of space for everyone to sleep in comfort. Plus these rooms have an outside balcony that is perfect for adults while the kids are sleeping. Like the Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta this property only requires 20000 World of Hyatt points per night for double occupancy.

(Screenshot courtesy of Hyatt)

Kids under 3 stay for free but any additional child or adult in the room will cost 10000 points per night. Rates at this property seem to be a little less than some of the other Hyatt all-inclusive properties but it is still an excellent use of your points.

Hilton Puerto Vallarta Resort in Puerto Vallarta Mexico

The Hilton Puerto Vallarta Resort on the Bay of Banderas on the west coast of Mexico is only about 10 minutes from the airport. Although this is a smaller resort there are still three pools (one adults-only) and a beautiful beach.

This hotel has six restaurants and four bars although many restaurants require reservations and have timed dining. They are also not open every day of the week. There are always a few restaurants available but your options will not be as plentiful as at someplace like the Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta. However there is an adult-only Hacienda and the resort includes room service.

Related: 11 things you should know before visiting Mexico

The kids club (ages 4 to 12 years old) includes minigolf a wading pool a giant movie and game room and many other daily activities. Typical hours are from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. but there is a pajama party for the kids where they roast marshmallows on select weekends. The hours are shorter than some other resort kids clubs and meals are not served (just snacks in case kids get hungry). You can hire babysitters for kids as young as four months old at $10/hour per child from the kids club. This pricing is extremely reasonable for babysitting services at a resort. But during peak dates the fees increase.

When you use your points at this property you are charged anywhere between 46000 and 70000 Hilton Honors points for double occupancy.

(Screenshot courtesy of Hilton)

Some of the features of this hotel do not appear to be as expansive as the Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta but there's excellent standard award availability. Plus kids five and under stay for free which is huge. But after the first two guests the resort charges $65 per child age six through 12 and typical adult pricing for kids 13+.

Viva Wyndham Maya Resort in Playa Del Carmen Mexico

Wyndham has eight all-inclusive hotels you can book with points in the Caribbean and Mexico. Best of all six of the locations are family-friendly Viva resorts. I'll highlight one of these resorts the Viva Wyndham Maya Resort in Playa del Carmen Mexico because it offers good availability and doesn't have minimum stay requirements.

This oceanfront resort offers five restaurants 24-hour snacks a kid's club and a mini-disco for kids. The rooms look uninspiring but the beach is enormous and the pools look relaxing. For 30000 Wyndham points per night families can book a superior garden-view room with two queen beds or a deluxe two-queen room that may have a better view. If you need more points check out our article on 16 ways to earn Wyndham Rewards points.

(Screenshot courtesy of Wyndham)

Wyndham's website will allow you to book rooms with up to four guests. However the website displays a notice stating:

go free® award nights at Viva Wyndham Maya – All-Inclusive Resort are valid for meals beverages and other resort amenities for up to two guests. If you have more than two guests staying in your room additional resort fees will apply. Please contact Wyndham Rewards Member Services at 866-996-7937 for details on additional fees.

So if you are traveling with your family you may want to call soon after you book a refundable award to check pricing for your additional family members. Then you can decide whether to keep your award or change your booking. After all cash prices and Go Fast awards (Wyndham's version of points and cash rates) vary based on the number of guests in your room. So you may find that booking a cash rate or Go Fast award provides better value.

Honorable mention all-inclusive resorts

Although there are a few other chain all-inclusive properties they either do not work well for families or do not allow you to use your hotel points. Here's a quick overview.

Booking AMResorts with Choice Privileges points

Dreams Riviera Cancun Resort and Spa (Photo courtesy of Choice Hotels)

In 2019 AMResorts and Choice Privileges became partners. As such you can redeem Choice Privileges points to stay at AMResorts locations in Mexico the Caribbean and several Central American countries. Family-friendly AMResorts brands you can book include Dreams Resorts & Spas Now Resorts & Spas and Sunscape Resorts & Spas.

There are now about 29 family-friendly AMResorts locations bookable with Choice points. Many of these resorts are high-end properties. But when using points most (if not all) resorts cap you at two guests per room including kids.

You could try booking a room with your points and calling the hotel directly to see if you can upgrade to a different room and pay extra for any additional guests. But your results may vary. Alternatively you could book two rooms with your points -- at twice the cost.

Rates are typically between 25000 and 100000 points per night depending on the property. If you are low on points you can transfer American Express Membership Rewards points or open the Choice Privileges Visa Signature Card. Or you can wait to buy Choice points during a promotion.

The information for the Choice Privileges Visa Signature card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

Holiday Inn Resort Ixtapa

At the Holiday Inn Resort Ixtapa on Mexico's Pacific coast you are capped at just two guests per room when redeeming IHG Rewards points. Plus your only choice when redeeming points is an ""All Inclusive Standard Room"" that states ""Bed type and smoking preference cannot be guaranteed as it will be allocated upon arrival based on availability"" in the description.

So if you need a specific room type want to book for more than two guests or don't want to be assigned a smoking room this may not be the resort for you. You could book an award (check the cancellation policy before booking) and call the hotel in advance to see if they can give you a room that will fit your needs. But the system doesn't allow families to stay on points easily.

Bottom line

With so many all-inclusive options it's easy to redeem your points for a genuinely free stay. If you are going to go the all-inclusive route I suggest starting to increase your point balance now with World of Hyatt IHG Rewards Hilton Honors Choice Privileges or Wyndham Rewards.

If I had to pick my favorite I'd choose the Hyatt Ziva properties. The brand has done a fantastic job of providing families with many activities and dining options. Its kid's clubs are a huge highlight. And it has also priced its properties very competitively by only requiring 20000 to 25000 points per night for double occupancy (though once you add a couple of kids aged 3+ to the reservation you are basically looking at the same award price for two rooms as all sharing one).

I watch for juicy credit card welcome bonuses and time my new credit applications around big annual purchases like our home or auto insurance so I can easily meet any minimum spend requirements.

I focus on a few travel rewards programs that I know I’ll use regularly such as Aeroplan WestJet Dollars Marriott Bonvoy and American Express Membership Rewards. I find these programs give me the best bang for my buck when I redeem points for travel.

But my spending has changed significantly over the past 15 months.

First I cancelled my long-time everyday spending card – the Capital One Aspire Travel World MasterCard – shortly after the company devalued the earn rate from 2% to 1.5% and stopped offering 10000 annual bonus miles.

Second with our 2020 trips cancelled and the bulk of our spending now coming from groceries and take-out I switched to using the Scotia Momentum Visa Infinite Card to maximize cash back on our food spending.

Third the PC Financial World EliteMasterCard added a new minimum spend requirement of $15000 to maintain eligibility. We didn’t meet this criteria so I cancelled the card. That was my go-to card for No Frills and Shoppers Drug Mart spending.

Finally we stopped going to Costco regularly to avoid the long lines and lax enforcement of public health measures. That meant no longer needing to carry a MasterCard at all (or a Costco card for that matter). I felt my wallet getting lighter.

With all of these changes I thought it would be fun to give readers a glimpse inside my wallet to see which cards I’m carrying now and how I still plan to maximize my rewards going forward.

Here’s a look inside my wallet:

Debit cards

I carry one debit card and that’s for our joint chequing account at TD Bank. I also have a business chequing account at TD and a no-fee chequing account at Tangerine but don’t carry the debit cards since all of those transactions are done online.

Years ago I threatened to close my TD chequing account and move to Tangerine to save on bank fees. The customer service rep made me an offer I couldn’t refuse by converting my chequing account to a student account which had no monthly fees at all and came with 25 transactions per month.

I haven’t paid bank fees for five years but I just received a letter from TD describing a bunch of fee increases (effective June 1) and that it will be auditing student accounts to make sure the account holder is in fact a student. I suspect my days of free banking at TD are over.

Credit cards

I have four credit cards in my wallet including the Scotia Momentum Visa Infinite card the American Express Cobalt Card the HSBC World Elite MasterCard and the American Express Business Platinum Card.

It goes without saying that I use a rewards credit card for all my purchases – and pay them off in full every month – but since I can’t find one credit card that works best for every single purchase I have to use a combination of cards in order to maximize my rewards.

I use the Scotia card for groceries and recurring bill payments like cable and internet. That’s because it pays 4% back on groceries and recurring bills. I get cash back once per year in November.

I use the Amex Cobalt card for groceries as well plus liquor store spending. This card pays 5x points on ‘eats and drinks’ plus a 2500 Membership Rewards bonus for every month you spend $500 (for the first 12 months only). I transfer these Membership Rewards points to Marriott Bonvoy at a transfer rate of 5:6.

I use the HSBC World Elite MasterCard for all other spending. I applied for this card in late 2020 to take advantage of an incredible 100000 point welcome bonus. I like the card and will consider keeping it as an everyday MasterCard if nothing better comes along. Points can be redeemed against any travel purchase plus you get a $100 travel enhancement credit.

Finally I use the American Express Business Platinum for all of our business expenses. This card currently has an unbelievable 100000 Membership Rewards bonus if you can spend $10000 in three months. I typically convert these Membership Rewards points to Aeroplan.

Those are the cards in my wallet but I do have several other credit cards lying around the house. These include the Amex Platinum Card the WestJet RBC World Elite MasterCard the TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite card and the CIBC Aeroplan Visa Infinite Card.

With the exception of the Amex Platinum Card which I’m holding as a luxury card that gets us hotel benefits and airport lounge access these cards are highly “churnable” and come with excellent welcome bonuses. The Aeroplan cards in particular are worth a look as the cards come with no annual fee for the first year a 20000 point welcome bonus plus a Buddy Pass.

Loyalty cards

I don’t carry any loyalty cards in my physical wallet but my Apple Wallet contains the following loyalty cards:

Aeroplan

Air Miles

PC Optimum

Priority Pass

Marriott Bonvoy

Scene

Thankfully I can access these cards on my phone so I don’t end up with a George Costanza sized wallet.

Cash

I don’t use cash very much to begin with and during the pandemic most businesses encouraged customers to pay with debit or credit anyway.

That’s why I literally have the exact same $20 $10 and two $5 dollar bills in my wallet today that I had in March 2020.

Miscellaneous

Of course I also have my driver’s license a NEXUS card my Alberta Health card and a couple of business cards in my wallet. I also have a library card.

Finally there’s a loyalty card from my barber shop that I haven’t used in 15 months. Special thanks to my wife for keeping my hair trim over the past year.

Final thoughts

My wallet is starting to fill up again after more than a year of using just one or two cash back cards.

It’s a bit of a pain to constantly switch up rewards credit cards and find new loyalty programs. But travel and cash back rewards can be highly lucrative if you put in some research and find the cards and programs that work for you.

It’s okay to start dreaming about travel again as we near the end of the pandemic and restrictions start to ease. Use up those travel credits that you received when trips were cancelled last year. Start collecting travel points so you can supplement your travel budget during your next trip (revenge travel anyone?).

Readers what’s in your wallet? Do you have the same $20 bill from last March?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS93b3JsZC9vbGRlc3QtYW1lcmljYW4tZmFzdGVzdC13b21hbi1vbi1ldmVyZXN0LXJldHVybi1zYWZlbHktNzMzNjY5OS_SAWxodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvd29ybGQvb2xkZXN0LWFtZXJpY2FuLWZhc3Rlc3Qtd29tYW4tb24tZXZlcmVzdC1yZXR1cm4tc2FmZWx5LTczMzY2OTkvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oldest American fastest woman on Everest return safely,"A retired attorney from Chicago who became the oldest American to scale Mount Everest and a Hong Kong teacher who is now the fastest female climber of the world’s highest peak on Sunday returned safely from the mountain where climbing teams have struggled with bad weather and a coronavirus outbreak.

Arthur Muir 75 scaled the peak earlier this month beating the record set by another American Bill Burke at age 67.

Tsang Yin-hung 45 of Hong Kong scaled the summit from the base camp in 25 hours and 50 minutes and became the fastest female climber. The record of 10 hours and 56 minutes is held by a Sherpa guide Lakpa Gelu.

A climbing accident on Everest in 2019 when Muir hurt his ankle falling off a ladder did not deter him from attempting to scale the peak again. He began mountaineering late in life and said he was scared and anxious during his latest adventure.

“You realize how big a mountain it is how dangerous it is how many things that could go wrong. Yeah it makes you nervous it makes you know some anxiety there and maybe little bit of scared” Muir told reporters in Kathmandu.

“I was just surprised when I actually got to there (the summit) but I was too tired to stand up and in my summit pictures I am sitting down” he said.

Muir began mountaineering at age 68 with trips to South America and Alaska before attempting Everest in 2019 when he fell off the ladder.

Climbing was closed last year due to the pandemic.

Married and a father of three Muir has six grandchildren. The last one — a boy — was born while he was still in the mountains during his current expedition.

Tsang made only two stops between the base camp located at 5300 meters (17390 feet) to the 8849-meter (29032-foot) summit to change and covered the near vertical distance in 25 hours and 50 minutes.

She was lucky because there were barely any climbers on the way to the highest camp at South Col. After that on her way to the summit she met only climbers making their descent which did not slow her speed climb.

There are only a few days of good weather left on the mountain this year when hundreds of climbers line up to the summit many having to wait for a long time in the traffic jam on the highest trail.

“I just feel kind of relief and happy because I am not looking for breaking a record” she said. “I feel relieved because I can prove my work to my friends to my students.”

She made a previous attempt on May 11 but bad weather forced her to turn back from a point very close to the summit. She then returned last Sunday.

“For the summit it is not just not your ability team work I think luck is very important” she said.

An outbreak of the coronavirus among climbers and their guides at the Everest base camp has forced at least three teams to cancel their expeditions. But hundreds of others have pushed through attempting to scale the summit at a time Nepal is in lockdown battling its worst surge in COVID-19."

ESPN UniMás and TUDN will broadcast from kybunpark at 2 p.m. ET.

Fans will also be able to follow the match via Facebook Twitter @USMNT Instagram @USMNT and the official U.S. Soccer App.

The match against Switzerland represents the sixth time the USMNT will face a Top 20 opponent since head coach Gregg Berhalter took charge of the team in 2019. Led by Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka and Liverpool midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri the Swiss are gearing up for the European Championship where they have been drawn into Group A with four-time World Cup champion Italy Turkey and Wales.

The Switzerland encounter combined with the Concacaf Nations League Final Four and the USMNT’s June 9 match in Salt Lake City against Costa Rica presented by Allstate will simulate a match cadence similar to what many players coming from Europe will experience during the upcoming three-match window as part of the World Cup Qualifying campaign that kicks off in September. Similar to European-based players in the pool during World Cup qualifying the U.S. team will travel from Europe to North America for three matches two for the Nations League in Denver and then Costa Rica in Utah.

WELCOME BACK



DeAndre Yedlin returns to the USMNT fold for the first time since November 2019. The veteran right back made the move to Galatasaray from Newcastle United earlier this year where his team finished second in the Turkish Süper Lig and secured a place in UEFA Champions League qualifying.

He is joined by fellow 2014 FIFA World Cup veteran Julian Green who earns his first call-up under Berhalter. The midfielder will seek his first cap since Nov. 15 2018 against England. Green has registered nine goals and three assists in 32 matches this season to help Greuther Fürth achieve automatic promotion to the Bundesliga.



COMPETITION COMING UP



The May 30 encounter vs. Switzerland is a lead-in to three significant competitions in 2021 beginning with the Concacaf Nations League Final Four. Winners of League A’s Group A the USMNT takes on Honduras in one semifinal while Mexico and Costa Rica will square off in the other with the winners competing for the inaugural Nations League title.

The USA will meet one of its most-frequent Concacaf foes on June 9 for a friendly against Costa Rica in Salt Lake City. Heading into this summer the USMNT holds a narrow 17-16-5 edge in the series through a rich history of 38 matches played since 1975.

The following month the U.S. will compete in the 2021 Concacaf Gold Cup in search of its seventh confederation championship. The USMNT has been drawn into Group A with Canada Martinique and a third team to be determined through pre-tournament qualifying. The United States last lifted the trophy in 2017 when Jordan Morris netted the game-winner against Jamaica in the 2-1 victory.

Those games serve as a prelude to the start of 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying which will feature an eight-team final round and commence in Sept. 2021.



TROPHY ROOM



With the USMNT competing for a pair of trophies this summer - the Concacaf Nations League and Gold Cup – several players have already earned silverware with their clubs. A total of nine players on the roster entered training camp with a championship under their belt. Brenden Aaronson did the double winning the Austrian Bundesliga and Austrian Cup. Zack Steffen also won two trophies with Manchester City backstopping the club to the English League Cup and becoming the first USMNT player to win the Premier League. Sergiño Dest (Barcelona) lifted the Copa del Rey in Spain while Weston McKennie (Juventus) in Italy along with Gio Reyna (Dortmund) in Germany and Mark McKenzie (Genk) in Belgium also won their respective domestic cup competitions. Tim Weah is a French league champion with Lille his club winning the title for the first time since the 2010-11 campaign Ethan Horvath and Club Brugge are league winners for the second season running and Jordan Siebatcheu helped Young Boys to the top of the Swiss league table for the fourth consecutive year.

And still one big title remains. The USMNT will gather around the screen the evening of May 29 to watch a teammate lift the Champions League trophy as Christian Pulisic and Steffen square off when Chelsea takes on Manchester City in the final.



TOP FOUR IN BIG FIVE



Members of the USMNT finished in the top four in each of the five biggest leagues in Europe starting with the league title winners in England (Steffen Manchester City) and France (Weah Lille). In Germany U.S. internationals populate three of the top four with Tyler Adams (RB Leipzing second) Gio Reyna (Borussia Dortmund third) and John Brooks (Wolfsburg fourth). Sergiño Dest completed his first season at Barcelona with a third-place La Liga finish. Christian Pulisic and Chelsea secured the fourth spot in the Premier League on the final matchday a feat and position matched by Weston McKennie and Juventus.

All eight players will be a part of next year’s Champions League.



30-PLUS



In another sign of U.S. internationals staking their claim at prominent clubs abroad nine players on the roster just completed seasons where they made 30 or more appearances in a top-flight European league: Weston McKennie (34 GP; Juventus) Yunus Musah (32 GP; Valencia) Jordan Siebatcheu (32 GP; Young Boys) Gio Reyna (31 GP; Borussia Dortmund) Josh Sargent (31 GP; Werder Bremen) John Brooks (31 GP; Wolfsburg) Reggie Cannon (31 GP; Boavista) Sergiño Dest (30 GP; FC Barcelona) and Matt Miazga (30 GP; Anderlecht).



POTENTIAL DEBUTS



Berhalter has given more opportunities to new players than any other USMNT head coach in the modern era at this point in their tenure. To this point 44 players have made their international debut during his first 25 matches at the helm of the program.

Four players have the opportunity to earn their first caps in the match against Switzerland: goalkeepers Chituru Odunze and David Ochoa defender Justin Che and forward Matthew Hoppe.



AGAINST SWITZERLAND



This week’s friendly marks just the third time in the last 25 years the USA has faced Switzerland. In the last match a Brek Shea free kick helped steer the USA to a 1-1 draw on March 31 2015 in Zurich.

Another free-kick finish remains the iconic moment of history between the teams. In the USA’s opening match of the 1994 FIFA World Cup a crowd of 77000 fans at the Pontiac Silverdome in Michigan witnessed an Eric Wynalda wonder strike that led to a 1-1 draw and the USMNT’s first point in a World Cup since 1950.

The May match will come nearly 31 years to the day of the USMNT’s first match in St. Gallen. Bruce Murray scored the U.S. goal in a 2-1 defeat to the Swiss on June 2 1990 in the team’s final match before taking part in the 1990 FIFA World Cup.

Overall the U.S. is 1-3-4 all-time against Switzerland and unbeaten in its last four.



LAST TIME OUT



A goal in the first half from Gio Reyna and a penalty kick in the second from Christian Pulisic helped lift the USA to a solid 2-1 victory against Northern Ireland on March 28 at the National Stadium at Windsor Park.

The goal marked the eighteen-year-old Reyna’s second in four career senior international matches while Pulisic became the 13th USMNT player to reach 15 career goals. The goal was Pulisic’s first for the U.S. since 2019.

The win – which extends the USA’s unbeaten streak to nine games (8-0-1) - was the USMNT’s first against a European opponent on the road since June 10 2015 when the red white and blue defeated defending World Cup champion Germany. It also snapped an 11-game away winless streak dating back to a victory against Cuba on Oct. 7 2016.

USA Line-up vs. Northern Ireland

1-Zack Steffen; 3-Aaron Long (15-Chris Richards 63) 4-Matt Miazga 13-Tim Ream; 2-Sergiño Dest (19-Bryan Reynolds 46) 23-Kellyn Acosta (12-Luca de la Torre 74) 8-Yunus Musah (17-Sebastian Lletget 46) 5-Antonee Robinson; 7-Gio Reyna (11-Brenden Aaronson 63) 16-Jordan Siebatcheu (21-Daryl Dike 63) 10-Christian Pulisic (Capt.)

The house in Gaza’s southern city of Khan Yunis immediately crumbled raining heavy stone and concrete blocks over their heads. Weam only 9 at the time was knocked unconscious.

When she awoke Weam found herself in a hospital with needles in her arm and beeping machines surrounding her bed. She almost went into shock when she learned that after three failed surgeries her left leg had to be amputated her father said.

“At the beginning of Weam’s injury she wasn’t sure she could ever live a normal life again or be like other children” Mohammed Elastal her father told CNN. “It was difficult for her to go to school in a wheelchair and she couldn’t play with other kids.”

In 2015 one year after the attack Palestine Children’s Relief Fund (PCRF) heard Weam’s story and stepped in to help.

The US-based non-profit organization sent Weam to a hospital in Jeddah Saudi Arabia where she was outfitted with her first prosthetic leg. Two years later after she outgrew it PCRF sent her to Atlanta where she lived with an American host family while receiving treatment and a new prosthesis.

Weam says PCRF changed her life. “Now I can do everything with my new leg” she said in a 2018 video made by PCRF. “I can climb up and down stairs. … I walk and I run. I also use my new leg to go to school.”

Weam is just one of nearly 86000 Palestinian children that PCRF has provided with free medical care since its founding in 1992. Among its many services the group provides medicines surgeries and cancer treatment as well as mental and physical therapy.

The group also sponsors volunteer medical teams to treat sick and injured Palestinian children in the West Bank and Gaza and has built two pediatric cancer facilities in the Palestinian territories.

But all the progress PCRF has made in Gaza was nearly lost last week when its office there was destroyed in a nearby Israeli airstrike.

“The bombing of our office in Gaza makes it much more difficult for our team to provide direct aid to sick and injured kids for mothers to bring their needy children to our attention for us to organize and implement direct humanitarian relief at a time when Gaza children need it most” PCRF founder and president Steve Sosebee told CNN from the group’s main office in Kent Ohio.

‘We will never stop – with or without an office’

PCRF’s office is located on the third floor of Ghazi Shawa a commercial building on Al-Wehda Street in the Al-Rimal neighborhood of Gaza City.

The area is a hub for medical care. Directly across the street is Al-Rimal Clinic one of the only facilities in the territory that can process coronavirus tests and the Ministry of Health which like other administrative entities in Gaza is run by Hamas.

Offices for the International Committee of the Red Cross Qatar Red Crescent Society and other international aid groups are nearby.

But May 17 in the latest round of fighting in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict the area was struck with Israeli fire.

A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces told CNN at the time that it had targeted the main operations center for Hamas’ internal security forces in the same neighborhood and that the target building was close to the medical clinics and aid offices.

The airstrike damaged Al-Rimal Clinic and the Ministry of Health’s administrative building the Ministry of Health said. Qatar Red Crescent Society was also damaged in the blast according to Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs which reported deaths and injuries but did not elaborate.

PCRF’s office was destroyed but no employees were injured Sosebee told CNN.

In a statement on Facebook the Ministry of Health said the airstrike effectively stopped the direct treatment of 103 patients one of whom had a head wound.

“This is a war crime and the entire world people of conscience need to stand against it” Dr. Yousef Abu Al-Rish a senior health official with the Ministry of Health said in a news conference held amid the rubble.

That Israeli airstrike was one of many during 11 days of renewed violence in the area.

Between May 10 and 20 Israeli airstrikes and artillery fire killed at least 248 people in Gaza including 66 children according to the health ministry there. Twelve people in Israel including two children died as a result of Palestinian militant fire from Gaza according to the Israel Defense Forces and Israel’s emergency service. At least 29 health facilities in Gaza have been damaged since May 10 according to UNICEF.

Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire that began on May 21.

“It’s a very frustrating situation” Sosebee said. “An office can be rebuilt you can buy another computer and get another desk material things can be replaced but lives cannot.”

Sosebee said the bombing was a significant setback for PCRF but he pledged to carry on.

“It will not stop us from our 30-year mission of helping the most vulnerable and neglected kids in the world the children of Gaza. We will never stop – with or without an office” Sosebee said.

‘As adults it’s our responsibility’

News of the airstrike quickly spread among PCRF’s dedicated supporters and volunteers many of whom expressed concern on social media or donated to the group’s fundraising campaign to support victims of the conflict.

Rania Jubran a former volunteer with the organization says PCRF and other aid groups deserve to be respected especially during times of war when their services are most vital.

In their San Diego home Jubran’s family has hosted six children whom PCRF brought to the United States for medical treatment. Among them was Farah a 3-year-old girl from Beit Lahya in northern Gaza.

In 2009 Farah’s home was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike that killed several family members including her mother Jubran said. The Israeli military’s use of munitions containing white phosphorus left Farah with third-degree burns all over her body she added.

The Jubran family cared for Farah as she underwent nine months of skin-graft treatment.

“She was heavily traumatized. It took her a very long time to even hear her speak” Jubran said. “At the time I was wrapping up my master’s degree in clinical psychology with a focus on children and so it was very dear to my heart seeing PTSD full-blown in front of me. It was really hard.”

Following her treatment Farah returned to be with her family in Gaza.

“We watched her grow from being traumatized to becoming somewhat of a normal kid here” Jubran said. “Sending her back was heartbreaking.”

“They are helping improve the quality of life of children parents and families” Jubran said. “It’s a golden thing. It should be common sense how wrong this is and the world should be watching.”

For Sosebee the airstrike has only strengthened his resolve to help children in need.

Since the bombing PCRF has provided urgent medical supplies to hospitals and clinics throughout Gaza and raised funds to provide even more. Sosebee says he also plans to rebuild.

“If airstrikes can hit our building how about apartment buildings? How about schools? How about hospitals? They can and have been hit and the casualties and innocent lives lost is unjustifiable” Sosebee said. “Children will continue to bear the brunt of this conflict and as adults it’s our responsibility … to do the hard work of finding a solution.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYmxvZ3Mud29ybGRiYW5rLm9yZy9lbi9oZWFsdGgvb21pbm91cy1mYWN0LXdvcmxkLW5vLXRvYmFjY28tZGF5LTIwMjEtc21va2luZy1raWxscy1tb3JlLXBlb3BsZS1jb3ZpZC0xOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An ominous fact on World No Tobacco Day – 2021: Smoking kills more people than COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has hit an unprepared world hard. The public health social and economic toll has been unprecedented in recent decades. As of mid-May 2021 more than 168 million people have been infected and 3.5 million have died of the disease. Based on estimated excess mortality for 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) recently indicated that the death toll is likely higher.

While this global crisis has unraveled social life across countries the equally devastating decades-old pandemic of tobacco use has continued unbated to claim lives and make people sick as it is causally linked to diseases of nearly all organs of the body. Around 25% of all heart disease deaths and 80% of lung cancer deaths are caused by smoking and many others are caused by exposure to secondhand smoke for example.

A different but devastating pandemic

Cigarette smoking is not only the most common form of tobacco use but one of the leading preventable risk factors for premature mortality worldwide  killing more than 8 million people a year including users and non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke.

Country evidence from China Italy and other countries suggests that smokers have higher odds of progression in COVID-19 severity and death compared to non-smokers. There are also significant health care costs for treating the diseases caused by tobacco use as well as the indirect economic costs that result from tobacco-attributable morbidity and mortality--on average smokers die 10 years earlier than nonsmokers which represents a major human capital loss in countries.

The above numbers point to an inescapable reality: tobacco use kills more people yearly than COVID-19. Far worse tobacco smoking is estimated to have killed 100 million people in the 20th Century and estimates suggest one billion people could die from smoking this century if no action is taken.

Although with delays and inadequacies and after much suffering this past year governments international agencies and communities have come to the realization that to suppress the spread of SARS-CoV-2 the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 disease and overcome the social and economic disruption it brought a coordinated well-organized and sustained global response is the only way out of this crisis.

Addressing the tobacco scourge with urgency

Similarly based on the painful lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic we cannot remain complacent in thinking that tobacco use is just another “endemic” condition in our communities and that this addiction will never go away. We must recognize however that this challenge is not an easy one to tackle and will require a sustained effort over the medium-term given the economic power of the tobacco industry. This becomes clear when one understands that in nominal terms the worldwide sales revenue of all tobacco products is forecast to increase on average by 2.5% per year between 2012 and 2025 eventually reaching US$888 billion by 2025 generating gigantic profits for the tobacco industry. It is not surprising to learn then from a Credit Suisse report that one dollar invested in tobacco stocks in 1900 was worth $6.3 million by 2010 165 times greater than the average industry.

As Prof. Chris Whitty England’s chief medical officer observed in a recent lecture “tobacco companies get people addicted in young age and then keep them addicted to something which they know will kill them” to maintain their profit shares. But we know how to address the tobacco scourge.

Indeed the 2005 Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) the first global treaty negotiated under the auspices of the WHO that has been ratified by 182 countries with more than 90% of the world population offers a menu of effective demand and supply reduction measures.

Key measures range from raising taxes on tobacco products to increase prices and reduce consumption and health risks while mobilizing additional tax revenue that enhances fiscal capacity of countries to fund priority investments and programs that benefit all; regulations to protect people from exposure to tobacco smoke in public places; comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising promotion and sponsorship; to interventions for strengthening governance arrangements to deal with illicit tobacco trade across the supply chain.

While the FCTC is a solid framework for tobacco control full implementation of some of its provisions at the country level continues to lag behind.

Commit to quit

I think that to celebrate this year’s World No Tobacco Day under the theme “Commit to Quit” it is apt to raise our collective voices to demand that countries worldwide support at the highest political levels the adoption and the full implementation of FCTC provisions to end the scourge of tobacco use and nicotine addiction. To this I would add the support that needs to be provided to initiatives such as Tobacco Free Portfolio which involves working collaboratively with the world’s largest financial organizations to implement tobacco-free finance policies—spanning lending investment and insurance.

The World Bank Group (WBG) has also been assisting countries to confront the development threat posed by tobacco use. The unambiguous Operational Directive 4.76 of 1999 mandates that the WBG does not lend directly to tobacco production processing or marketing; provide grants for investment in these activities; or guarantee investments loans or credits for these industries . WBG policy advice technical assistance and operations support tobacco tax increases to protect the population from health risks and to mobilize additional public revenue to aid in the post-pandemic recovery.

There is no time to lose. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the potential devastating impact of unattended public health social and environmental risks and their spillover effects in a fast-changing interconnected world. The sobering experience bestowed upon all of us by the still ongoing pandemic clearly illustrates the high price that societies pay for inaction in dealing with global challenges old and new. Tobacco use is a decades-old pandemic that needs to be suppressed once and for all across the world as a moral public health and development imperative.

For those like me who have lost loved ones due to lung cancer and other tobacco-related diseases preventing smoking and the use of e-cigarettes by young people to make the next generation tobacco free is not only the right thing to do; more importantly it represents the type of concerted global effort that is required to confront major societal risks that could undermine the development of healthy productive and more inclusive and equitable societies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdnkubWlsL0Rlc2t0b3BNb2R1bGVzL0FydGljbGVDUy9QcmludC5hc3B4P1BvcnRhbElkPTEmTW9kdWxlSWQ9NjkyJkFydGljbGU9MjQxOTUwNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rear Admiral Thomas M.

Putin.

The latest hack was brought to light late Thursday by Microsoft and other private firms. They exposed how Russia’s S.V.R. the same intelligence agency that Washington has blamed for a range of cyberattacks on American networks over the past decade infiltrated the communications company that distributes emails on behalf of the United States Agency for International Development.

Using that access they sent authentic-looking messages to human rights groups nonprofit organizations and think tanks including some that have been critical of Mr. Putin. The emails contained links to malware that gave the Russians access to the recipients’ computer networks.

The White House on Friday played down the severity of the attack saying it was typical of daily cyberconflict. Officials said the fact that the attack had been caught quickly and neutralized — chiefly by Microsoft which acted when it saw fake emails being sent — was evidence that enhanced defenses being deployed to defend government networks were beginning to show results."

When he and co-founder Steve Burian launched the company in October 1991 “we started from scratch” said Vein who is retiring this month.

“We basically had a drafting table a borrowed computer a desk and business cards and that’s all we had” he said adding “with a 1-year-old a 3-year old and a 5-year-old at home.”

Today AE2S – short for Advanced Engineering and Environmental Services LLC – specializes in water-related engineering projects. It employs about 300 people in 23 offices serving the Dakotas Minnesota Montana Utah Colorado Arizona and Wisconsin.

Vein has dedicated much of his 45-year engineering career to improving drinking water quantity and quality for residents of the Upper Midwest. He has been heavily involved in the development of AE2S offices in Grand Forks and Williston N.D.; Maple Grove Minn.; Sioux Falls S.D.; and Lehi Utah.

Among the many highlights of his career is his role in serving as project manager for the modernization of the city of Grand Forks Water Treatment Plant in 1984 when he was employed by KBM engineering firm he said.

Prior to starting AE2S he was employed for about 15 years at KBM where he worked on a variety of projects.

“I realized that the water treatment area required your complete attention to stay on top of requirements technologies and equipment and those kinds of things” he said. “I was given the unique opportunity at KBM to move into the drinking water engineering side of their business so I was able to concentrate on that. … By far my personal major project was I basically redesigned the Grand Forks water plant.

“We modified the existing processes and added new processes and it’s been fun to see that plant operate until this year when it got replaced with the new plant” he said.

“That got me into the water world. It specifically got me into the surface water world which is even more defined and regulatory-wise there were some very specific new requirements that all of the surface water plants had to meet. And that was the thing that got me to look at starting a company that did drinking water.”

Specialization

The AE2S co-founders Vein and Burian carved an unusual spot in the engineering industry.

“We weren’t like any of our competition” Vein said “because most engineering firms are what I would call generalists; they do this (water-related work) but they do a lot of things. I found in my experience that I couldn’t be designing streets and roads one day and a complex water plant the next day. It required complete concentration.

“We started very much of a niche firm specifically in drinking water” he said.

Vein and his AE2S colleagues have also been at the forefront of other important water-related projects here and throughout the region.

He led the effort to rebuild the Grand Forks water treatment system after the historic Flood of 1997 as well as the city’s subsequent recovery efforts. He had the unique advantage of complete knowledge and understanding of the system because he had designed it 13 years earlier.

During the height of the oil boom in western North Dakota Vein invested considerable time working to find solutions to the problem of insufficient water supplies for an area that was growing rapidly.

He helped coordinate the infrastructure needs for Williston which more than doubled in population between 2010 and 2020. He was also instrumental in the creation of the Western Area Water Supply Authority through legislation in 2011.

As he approaches a new chapter in his life Vein reflects on the pillars that have made the firm so successful.

“Trust is huge” he said. “If someone is going to trust us to design a $100 million water plant they better have faith that you’re going to be able to do the job.”

The AE2S employees work on projects that range in cost from the millions to over $1 billion.

Fordville farm roots

Vein who grew up in the Fordville N.D. area attended school in Fordville before his family moved to Grand Forks when he entered ninth grade. He graduated from Grand Forks Central High School in 1972 and earned a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering from UND in 1976.

He credits teachers and coaches including Pat Sullivan at Central and Frank Zazula at UND for their positive influence.

“The relationships I developed with my coaches were extremely meaningful in my life” he said.

Sullivan and Zazula were “huge impacts in my life.”

Over the years Vein has received numerous awards and accolades from industry organizations including the 1997 Environmental Achievement Award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the 2006 Kenneth J. Miller Founders Award and the 2007 George Warren Fuller Award both from the American Water Works Association.

But he is emphatic that the recognition belongs to the people who work at AE2S and the relationships they’ve built with clients that have led to successful projects.

“Relationships are first and foremost for Charlie” said Grant Meyer AE2S CEO. “Yeah it’s a business but Charlie’s always focused on the people part of it above everything else. You take good care of the clients you take good care of your staff and the business side of things will more or less take care of itself.”

Vein has mastered the art of developing close professional and sometimes personal relationships with clients and staff members leaders of state and federal agencies legislators and local politicians Meyer said. Those connections have been key to building a level of trust that ultimately leads to successful water-related projects across the region.

Vein recognizes that “it’s the people that make the company” Meyer said. That approach has been an important factor in building a company that enjoys “incredibly high repeat business. I will frequently talk about (how) we don’t chase projects; we want to develop relationships with clients and over time those clients will have projects.”

‘Core values’

Meyer who began working at AE2S as a UND graduate in spring 1997 said “The core values of AE2S as long as I’ve been here have gone back to the same six words: attitude vision integrity passion relationships and value.”

“The values AE2S promotes as a firm are the values that Charlie lives every day” Meyer said.

“The legacy he leaves at AE2S is truly awe-inspiring. Charlie’s legacy is a foundation of core values relationships and commitment to client success that will continue to guide the leadership of AE2S for the next generation.”

“Charlie is a wonderful mentor who went into the engineering field to improve people’s lives by improving their drinking water” Meyer said. “I can say without a doubt Charlie made a difference in the lives of thousands and thousands of people – from the residents of large and small communities across the eight states where AE2S has offices to the people he’s helped through his charitable work.”

Soft-spoken and modest Vein prefers to take a broader view of the company.

“I feel totally blessed to be part of this company” he said. “This isn’t about me; this company is not about me. It’s about a great team that has come together to do great things.”

In recent weeks he’s driven hundreds of miles to various AE2S offices a ""thank you tour"" visiting with staff and clients he said. “It’s been a fun time of reflecting.”

Vein doesn’t think of this change as retirement but rather as another stage of life – when he will be able to spend more time with his wife Leeza and their three daughters and grandchildren.

“I still want to do some significant things” he said which will include engaging with and supporting a number of Christian ministries.

Since his retirement was announced Vein seems genuinely surprised by the responses.

“The comments I’ve received from staff and clients have blown me away” he said.

“I’m just an ordinary engineer doing my work. I’ll go away thinking more about the people than the projects.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxmb3JkZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzA1LzMwL2JyaWVmcy1sb2NhbC1idXNpbmVzc3Blb3BsZS1pbmNsdWRpbmcta3VydC1rYXNodWJhLXlhZ2VyLWJldGgtYmVydG9uYXNzaS1hbmQtYW15LW1hbGxldHRlLzc0Mjg3MDYwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Briefs on local businesspeople including Kurt Kashuba Will Yager Beth Bertonassi and Amy Mallette.,"The Milford Daily News

Steven Spielberg once warned Kevin Costner before the making of 1995's ""Waterworld."" Given Spielberg's own troubled experiences during the production of ""Jaws"" it's safe to say he was offering sound advice. Costner swiftly ignored that advice and went on to participate in one of the biggest behind-the-scenes fiascos in movie history complete with flooding sets and personal injuries.

Unfortunately Costner's efforts were not enough for ""Waterworld"" to make the following list of great movies set on the water. ""Jaws"" certainly did however as it's easily among the most classic films to involve water in a central capacity. As either a thematic motif perennial backdrop or physical obstacle (or all of the above) water plays an important role in a number of acclaimed works. Today we honor some of the best examples.

Stacker surveyed film history and compiled a list of movies across decades countries and genres that take place primarily on a body of water whether on a ship in a quiet seatown or the current of a river. To qualify the film had to have at least a 7.0 on IMDb. The 25 films chosen are organized alphabetically.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vNDI0MDE5L3RoZS1yZWFsLXJlYXNvbi15b3VyLXdhdGVyLXRhc3Rlcy1saWtlLW1ldGFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Real Reason Your Water Tastes Like Metal,"The Real Reason Your Water Tastes Like Metal

""There may be a number of reasons why your water has a metallic taste"" Water Logic a company that makes water dispensers and filters noted in its blog-styled response to a hypothetical worried water drinker. ""The most likely reason is the presence of actual metal content.""

Before we rupture anything with our eye rolls the company continues to list minerals that could be the cause of the metal tasting water. There is the possibility that this is due to common place contaminants like zinc copper or iron. In some cases this could be due to pipes rusting with lead pipes being the worst cases scenario. Alternatively it could be due to a pH imbalance in the water.

Outside of cases in which you have lead in your water Tap Score states that metallic tastes will probably not be ruinous to your health. Though high levels of zinc could induce vomiting you would notice those kinds of concentrations before you drink enough to vomit. Similarly iron and manganese could stain fixtures and laundry but you do not need to panic over ingesting that either.

Ultimately Water Logic's advice comes in three parts. First stop drinking the weird tasting water. Second have the water tested to ensure that it is free of lead. Third buy Water Logic's products because if you always filter your water you will never have to worry about metallic or lead contaminants coming out of your tap again. After all metallic-tasting water does help the brand promote its products well.",,,

Horn Family Foundation the Owensboro Museum of Fine Art has exceeded the $700000 mark in their capital fund drive. Referred to as A Campaign for the Future the drive began in 2020 to ensure the museum will continue to prosper moving forward.

Horn Foundation Executive Director Kathryn Crowe was excited to present the campaign’s request to the foundation’s board.

“I asked myself and the board where we could be without the museum and we answered that question by providing support for the campaign” she said. “We appreciate the work that is done by the OMFA and we know it is a great asset to Owensboro.”

The Horn Foundation has provided financial support to the OMFA for more than a decade. This one-time gift exceeds their annual contribution to Artland the Museum’s free children’s art studio which offers several activities throughout the year.

The museum has aspirations of raising $2 million a third of which will re-establish its endowment fund for daily operation.

OMFA was established in 1977 as a small community art museum and through the patronage of local regional and national supporters has grown into the second-largest art museum in Kentucky. Notable expansions include the addition of a permanent collection wing and the acquisition of the John Hampden Smith House and the former Carnegie Library both of which are on the National Register of Historic Sites.

The campaign team is led by museum board chair Dr. James F. Naas with support from Campaign Cabinet including former City Commissioner Pam Smith-Wright; US Bank Executive Vice President Kathryn Raymer; OMFA Chairmen Emeritus Dr. R. Wathen Medley Jr. and B. Dean Stanley; Ameriprise Financial Advisor Drew Watson; Jeff Danhauer Danhauer Drugs; and former Owensboroans Gail Reisz Branch and H. Dean Jones II.

Admission to the museum is free. Hours of operation are Tuesday through Friday from 12-5 p.m. and from 1-4 p.m. on weekends.

OMFA also recently launched a new website courtesy of a donation from Dr. R. Wathen Medley Jr. that significantly increases their online presence.

Why it matters: Non-small cell lung cancer with a specific mutation in a gene known as KRAS has been considered to be resistant to any sort of drug treatment per the FDA. Lumakras was able to shrink the tumors of between 36% and 58% of patients studied.

What they're saying: ""Today’s approval represents a significant step towards a future where more patients will have a personalized treatment approach"" said Richard Pazdur director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the FDA's Office of Oncologic Diseases.

Details: The drug will target specifically KRAS G12C mutations which comprise approximately 13% of mutations in non-small cell lung cancers which is the most common type of lung cancer.

The approval is for a daily 960 milligram pill

The drug ""will have U.S. list price of $17900 per month"" per NBC News.

What to watch: Amgen said the FDA is requiring the company conduct a post-approval trial to see if a lower dose could have a similar effect.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In other words if you want to listen to adult contemporary in the Washington D.C. area you press the “FM” button and then punch in “9-7-1.”

Goodwill wanted five bucks for it. I would have paid well a few more. A very nice 7-4885 on eBay can sell for close to $200. The keypads often stop working due to corrosion of exposed contacts but some very careful sandpaper work can restore them completely. There’s a small community of enthusiasts for these devices and I’ve restored more than one of them so far.

Clock radios were and still are fascinating to me. They’re less collectible and seemingly less interesting than other electronics like retro video game consoles vintage stereo gear or early home computers. One of the most common devices in American homes for decades clock radios came in a dizzying variety of shapes sizes and styles. They were also a sort of trickle-down beneficiary of a great deal of innovation that took place higher up in the electronics industry.

I can illustrate this just with my own personal collection which is large but by no means exhaustive of clock-radio history. There’s a General Electric model that uses amber-burning nixie tubes for its time display possibly the only clock radio to ever do so. There’s a small flipping-digit clock with a little plastic window on top under a small lightbulb compartment which somehow projected the time onto the ceiling. Sony designed a line of clock radios dubbed EZ which featured a set of dials for setting the hour and minute for the time or alarm just the way you’d dial to a temperature setting on your stove. Panasonic had a cube-shaped clock whose front was a mirror. Powered off you only see yourself. Powered on the time and radio dial appear behind the glass. Another Panasonic used a complicated record-like mechanism to electronically read aloud the current time at the touch of a button without the aid of a digital voice synthesizer.

The 1970s were the heyday of the clock radio. For some reason the analog units from the ’60s weren’t terribly stylish and their inexpensive clock movements are prone to failure today. The ’70s saw the mainstreaming of digital clock radios. But not in the initially odd formulation used later in the early ’80s “electronic digital.” The ’70s were the era of mechanical flipping-digit clocks or “flip clocks”—think of the clock that plagues Bill Murray’s character in Groundhog Day a white plastic Panasonic model released in 1976. Or the faux-woodgrain model that wakes up Marty McFly in Back to the Future. Some flip clocks were wonderfully built and mimicking the home hi-fi components of the day some even had solid wood cases. The clock radio while common was still expensive enough to be a platform for innovation and showmanship.

But back to the Great Awakening.

First released in 1979 and sold for a few years into the early ’80s the Great Awakening series came at a crossroads in consumer technology. At the time the only consumer devices with direct-entry numerical keypads were touch-tone phones calculators a few expensive microwaves (most still used dials) and the odd police scanner or personal computer keyboard still a rarity in American homes. Even high-end stereo receivers and tuners usually retained plain old radio dials. With the Great Awakening GE was selling a clock radio but the company was also showcasing what technology could do.

Yet looking back there was only a very brief period in which punching a time or radio station directly into your clock radio was actually a marketable novelty—or really a novelty at all. As the price of semiconductors rapidly fell computers became increasingly affordable. And as the electronics inside of consumer devices got smaller and cheaper the overall products did too. With today’s technology it would cost pennies to implement the functionality of the Great Awakening clock radio again. But aside from nostalgic adults and a few young fogeys it probably wouldn’t find much of a market.

In 2011 Sony effectively exited the shrinking clock radio market when it discontinued its iconic Dream Machine brand. Aside from a few cheap plastic boxes and a handful of high-end curiosities very few clock radios are still made and sold—and for much the same reason that many people stopped wearing wristwatches in the last dozen years: A smartphone does everything and more. A stylish and exquisitely designed clock radio is no longer a symbol of a middle-class household nor is a must-have in a bedroom.

But the smartphone exactly because it is so multifunctional is a constant source of distraction. You are never more than one tap away from all your various work and leisure apps whether you’re checking the time or date setting your alarm or calculating a tip. The virtually endless digital possibilities in that little black rectangle of glass may actually foreclose some of the creativity that might come from interacting with the variety of distinct analog and electronic objects that used to perform these functions.

This multifunctionality and the devices which make it possible are examples of what economists call dematerialization. In environmental terms it’s a good thing. It means more economic value for less natural resources. Think of all the hefty devices that a smartphone renders redundant or obsolete which no longer need to be manufactured shipped and discarded. But with this dematerialization of consumer goods has come a sort of dematerialization of everyday life. We no longer use terms like “cyberspace” or “information highway” unironically—these days we use the term “meatspace” unironically—but whatever these liminal spaces are and whatever we call them they consume more and more of our time.

The resurgence of interest in obsolete but tactile technologies like typewriters Polaroid cameras vinyl records and even cassette tapes is driven in part by a gnawing sense that too much of our lives are mediated through screens. These old technologies are as journalist David Sax dubbed them in his 2016 book The Revenge of Analog “real things.” To that initial list I would add clock radios.

The Great Awakening clock radio in a way forecast the ultimate uselessness of clock radios. But it was also a unique and inventive way of demonstrating that cutting-edge technology could be a servant and not a master.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiIWh0dHBzOi8vaGV0cS5hbS9lbi9hcnRpY2xlLzEzMTQ2ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2020 Karabakh War: Azerbaijani Military Used Turkish Rockets to Hit Shushi Cathedral,"Hetq based on the factual evidence and professional assessments at its disposal has attempted to ascertain what weapons Azerbaijani forces employed to strike the Holy Savior (Ghazanchetsots) Cathedral in Shushi on October 8 2020.

On that day Azerbaijani forces twice struck the Holy Savior Cathedral (built in 1868-1887) which is not only the diocesan center of the Armenian Apostolic Church in Artsakh but one of the most prominent symbols of Armenian identity in Shushi and Artsakh. In addition during the war local Armenians took refuge in the basement of the church.

The Azerbaijani military first struck the cathedral shortly after noon on October 8 followed by another attack that evening. During the second strike Russian journalists and their Armenian escort were in the church and were injured.

Both strikes hit the southern part of the church roof with great accuracy. The Hetq team (Editor-in-Chief Edik Baghdasaryan photographers Hakob Poghosyan Saro Baghdasaryan) visited the church after the first strike filming there and on the way to Shushi during which the team recorded the sound of an enemy UAV in the sky. After the second blow on the evening of October 8 our team made its way to Ghazanchetsots on the morning of the 9th.

On the 9th of the month our journalists found armament remains inside the church including parts of the control system and a metal ring in church courtyard.

Remains of the control system

Edik Baghdasaryan finds a metal ring

In addition the church guard handed Hetq reporters a piece of metal resembling a rocket wing.

Hetq showed the control system and metal parts to Armenian specialists to understand what weapons they might have belonged to. Although we do not claim that they are all remnants of the same weapon it should be noted that the Azerbaijani military did not target Ghazanchetsots before the two strikes on October 8 which probably means that the parts found by the journalists and the guard belong to the weapon that struck the famous Armenian religious structure. It is also difficult to say whether both strikes were carried out with the same weapon. But the fact is that they were delivered to the same point on the roof with great accuracy which increases the likelihood that the same weapon was used.

Ghazanchetsots after the first strike on Oct. 8

Regarding the first Azerbaijani strike Shushi residents told reporters and Human Rights Watch (HRW) that they saw three Azerbaijani planes in the sky. An HRW researcher visited the church on October 13 and recorded not only the damage to the church but also a few small pieces of ammunition.

Ghazanchetsots after the second strike on Oct. 8

Examining the photographs that appeared on the Internet after the first and second strikes (the hole in the roof of the church and the remains of ammunition) and the details found on the spot the HRW researcher could not identify the weapon used in each strike. But the remains showed that weapons used had accurate strike capability and that it was possible to adjust the flight course of the weapon after its launch. Hetq also reached this conclusion. The two accurate strikes indicate that the Azerbaijani military used precision-guided/smart weapons.

The HRW researcher's report that no remnants of air-to-ground weaponry were found is significant. Hetq with the help of Armenian specialists also concluded that the Azerbaijani military hit Ghazanchetsots not from the air but from the ground that is the church was not targeted by UAVs or a plane.

Azerbaijani military used 300 mm rockets

In the photo below aircraft designer and engineer Arman Poloyan points out that one of the metal fragments is a rocket engine nozzle ring through which the gases generated during combustion in the rocket engine exit.

The soot left on the inner surface of the nozzle ring in our possession is the result of the emission of gas. This ring which was produced in 2018 is the last detail of the missile's rear section. Poloyan says that judging by the color and weight of the ring metal it’s most probably a titanium alloy and the specific alloy can be detected via analysis. The 300 mm diameter of the ring is noteworthy and we’ll return to it later.

The other part produced in 2017 and deformed because of the impact and explosion is apparently made of aluminum. It completely corresponds to the nozzle ring in terms of its volume and number of grooves.

Nozzle ring and deformed remnant

The aluminum part has NAS (National Aerospace Standards) screws used in aviation and rocketry.

These screws attached the aluminum part to the rest of the fuselage. The remaining composite materials of the fuselage are seen below.

Thus the nozzle ring and the corresponding deformed part attached to it remaining composite materials of the fuselage lead to the conclusion that we are dealing with a 300 mm caliber missile.

The other remnant of the rocket is its wing which acts as a stabilizer-steering mechanism.

In the picture you can see the axis of rotation of the wing around which it moves ensuring the proper flight course of the rocket. The wing is also made of titanium alloy judging by the color and weight of the metal. What we see in the picture is the metal frame of the wing on which however some parts of the composite cover are preserved.

There’s a layer made of cork on the frame and on it another layer made of CFRP (carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics). Poloyan says they ensure the streamlining of the structure.

Thanks to the cork and carbon fiber the missile also cannot be detected by radar since the carbon fiber doesn’t reflect radar waves. The waves either penetrate the fiber or are absorbed. The missile’s streamlined design also frees it from radar detection.

The structure of the wing in the form of a trapezoid is also important. This is the data of the sample we have.

There are several types of 300 mm caliber weapons in Azerbaijan’s arsenal: the Russian Smerch Belarusian Polonez (301 mm) the Turkish Kasırga multiple launch rocket system and maybe we can include the Israeli EXTRA missiles (306 mm) launched from LYNX multiple launch rocket system. These are all surface-to-surface missiles.

The Smerch and Polonez missiles have more than one stage i.e. sometime after launch their combat part separates from the rear where the engine is which means that the latter does not reach the target as we see in the case of the Ghazanchetsots strike. The whole rocket reached the church with stabilizer-wings and a nozzle. In addition the Russian and Belarusian missile stabilizers look completely different from what we have collected. The same can be said about the Israeli EXTRA whose caliber is also slightly different. EXTRA also has an air-to-ground version (Rampage) but its stabilizers are also significantly different from what we have on hand.

Comparing the 300 mm caliber of the missile that hit the Shushi Cathedral and the structure of the wing with the weapons in the arsenal of Azerbaijan Arman Poloyan says with 90% certainty that it was Kasırga TRG-300 guided rockets that struck the Shushi church.

TRG-300 rocket

Rocket uses complex control system

Although little remains of the missile control system found by the Hetq team we can draw some important conclusions. As you can see in the photo there are four printed circuit boards in the metal mold. Poloyan counted eight layers in each. The number of layers speaks to the complexity and capabilities of the device.

The printed circuit board assembly includes various components including FPGA chips. (A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing – hence the term ""field-programmable"".)

Poloyan says that these are processors that handle large amounts of information and make calculations at extremely high speeds. For example rocket stabilization or guidance is done through FPGA chips.

In the photo taken under a magnifying glass you can see the Cyclone V type FPGA chip of the American company Altera (owned by technology giant Intel Corporation) which was produced in South Korea.

We also used a magnifying glass to photograph the transceiver manufactured by the American company Analog Devices and released in Singapore. Such devices both receive and transmit radio channels that is information. This is an important circumstance suggesting that the rocket that struck the Shushi church was controlled.

We mentioned above that according to engineer-designer Arman Poloyan the Azerbaijani military used a TRG-300 Kaplan (Turkish for tiger) rocket. The video below shows a TRG-300 Tiger rocket fired by the T-300 Kasırga (hurricane) system manufactured by the Turkish company Roketsan. The rockets are launched from a four-barrel MCLS (multi-caliber launcher system).

The TRG-300 has two variants: BLOCK-I and BLOCK-II. The total weight of the first is 585 kg and the warhead weighs 105 kg. The second weighs 670 kg and carries a 190 kg warhead. The range of BLOCK-I is 30-120 km and the heavier BLOCK-II - 20-90 km. The US GPS and the Russian GLONASS satellite navigation systems as well as the INS (inertial navigation system) are used to guide the TRG-300. The rocket is accurate out to ten meters.

Hetq with the help of Armenian communications specialists revealed that the electronic circuit of the missile control system we discovered could provide frequency of up to 1900 MHz. In the circuit we have found band-pass filters (BPF) that pass frequencies within a certain range and reject frequencies outside that range. In this case as we can see in the photo the filters produced by the South Korean company SGC Technologies Inc. provided a bandwidth of 1230 MHz.

Filter remnants

What makes this interesting? This is a frequency used by the American GPS system. In general GPS uses three bands: 1563-1587 MHz (known as L1) 1215-1239.6 MHz (L2) and 1164-1189 MHz (L5). All three are applicable for both civilian and military needs.

To sum up we have metal parts which by their size suggest a 300 mm caliber missile in the arsenal of Azerbaijan. The presence of the rear of the rocket on the grounds of Ghazanchetsots Cathedral suggests that we are dealing with a single-stage rocket such as the Turkish TRG-300.

On the other hand the receiver-transmitter found on the electronic circuit suggests that the missile is indeed guided and the filters suggest that the rocket uses a GPS frequency which according to official Roketsan data is also used to control the TRG-300.

How and when the warheads were detonated

According to the official data of the manufacturer TRG-300 uses two types of fuzes: contact fuze and proximity fuze. If the warhead of the former explodes when hitting the target in the latter the explosion takes place without hitting the target at a short distance from it. Damage using a non-contact explosive is estimated to be several times more effective than damage using a contact explosive.

The Human Rights Watch researcher examining the interior of Ghazanchetsots Cathedral after the October 8 2020 strikes has suggested that delay fuze warheads were used during the second strike since there were numerous traces of debris on the structure’s inner walls. That is the warhead didn’t explode when hitting the roof but afterwards inside the church.

However such a result may also mean that a proximity fuze was used which detonated a few meters above the floor of the church damaging the walls as well.

In other words the Azerbaijani military after hearing Armenian reports that civilians were sheltering in the church could have detonated such an explosive aiming to inflict more damage than the first strike. It is assumed that the warhead exploded inside the church but in the air above the floor. It is no coincidence that journalists there were injured during this second strike.

If you buy a new TV chances are it won’t have a coax connector. It may have several HDMI USB and component connectors but no coax. If you have an older cable or satellite box that only outputs coax you could have trouble connecting the two.

You may think that coax is a bit outdated but there are plenty of excellent devices out there that we still use today. Whether you still use that old VHS player or an older game console or perhaps you’re using an antenna there are plenty of options available for you. In this article we’ll walk you through the options to make your older tech compatible with your newer devices.

AV connection types

While it may seem an obvious oversight to some of you not fully considering the output of the receiver is an easy oversight. For many years coax was the default output and has only recently been fully superseded by SCART or HDMI. Many cable and satellite receivers came with coax SCART and HDMI. Few were purely coax.

Coaxial connections

Coaxial cable was invented sometime in the 19th century to carry radio signals. It is comprised of a copper core of two layers surrounded by insulation and shielding. The idea was to deliver analog signals with a minimum of interference. The technology was in use until recently first in radio and telegraphy then TV and then broadband. It was gradually replaced with fiber or other technologies that offered faster transmission speeds.

Even though coax is insulated the signal needs frequent repeating and is subject to data loss over distance. Coax was popular because it was superior to anything else at the time was cheap and easy to use. It was also very durable. Fiber is faster and can carry more data at once. Though fiber requires more upfront investment it requires less maintenance.

HDMI

HDMI or High-Definition Multimedia Interface is the modern replacement for coax in the home. It is used to carry signals between devices with the maximum amount of data possible for high definition or ultra-high-definition broadcasts. It can carry audio too. HDMI was invented by Japanese TV manufacturers to help improve picture quality and works exceptionally well.

HDMI is purely digital and is therefore insulated against loss and does not need frequent repeating over distance. It can carry more data further for the same size at higher speeds. Digital transmissions are immune to interference when the correct configuration is used so it is very useful in busy households with lots of devices and WiFi networks.

Choosing the Right Coax to HDMI Adapter

There are a couple of ways you can convert your Coax to HDMI and vise versa. Depending on the devices you’re trying to connect one option may work better than another. Either way it will take some upgraded equipment to get everything hooked up and working properly. However your equipment needs depend on the devices you want to connect. Let’s break it down.

1. Over-the-Air (OTA) to HDMI Converters

Source: Amazon.com

For those of you who have indoor/outdoor antennas with coax and no coax input on your TV you need a simple OTA coax to HDMI adapter which costs anywhere between $30-$50. The price is low because no major conversion components are required since air signals are not encrypted like cable TV.

2. Satellite/Cable TV Box Coax to HDMI Converters

Source: Amazon.com

Depending on your cable provider if the receiver has only a coax output it is due for replacement. You may also need a converter if the RCA outputs on your satellite or cable box failed. Not including SCART or any HDMI output means your satellite/cable box could be anything up to 25 years old and should be replaced. However if it is working fine or your service provider wants to charge you for an upgrade it might not be your best option.

The satellite or cable TV coax-to-HDMI converter must include demodulation which brings the price up to over $100. Coax TV signals use radio frequency (RF) modulation that outputs to channel 3 or 4 on your TV. Also cable boxes and satellite dishes use encrypted signals that pass through the coax. Therefore the converter must have decryption technology too. This type of coax to HDMI converter is hard to find especially with all the similar options out there that don’t work for your needs. Just look for a cable TV coax demodulator to HDMI converter.

3. VCR/Old Game Console to HDMI Converters

VCRs and older game consoles did not use HDMI outputs because they didn’t exist. Therefore you need an RCA or NTSC coax-to-HDMI converter. However it needs a demodulator to convert the RF signal to HDMI out. That scenario means you need one of the same $100+ converters used for cable TV coax to HDMI.

How to Actually Convert Coax to HDMI

If you’re unable to obtain updated devices with an HDMI to HDMI connection use these steps to complete the conversion from coax to HDMI.

Plug your source’s coax into the “Coax In” connection on the converter. Insert the HDMI cable into the “HDMI Out” on your converter. Connect the other end of the HDMI cable to your HDTV. Ensure both devices (souce and TV) are turned on. Set the converter box to channel 3 or 4 to receive the coax signal. Set your HDTV to the correct HDMI input.



Whether you need an OTA antenna coax to HDMI converter or a cable TV/satellite demodulator to HDMI converter the process above is the same.

Frequently Asked Questions

Which is better coax or HDMI?

Aside from the nostalgia users get from seeing those brightly colored coaxial connectors the everyday user will benefit from making the transition from coax to HDMI. The latter provides a stronger and faster connection making both the video and audio quality better. HDMI cables also require only one connection as opposed to two or more with coax so they’re easier to use and more visually appealing.

Are coaxial cables still used today?

Yes some TV antenna equipment still use the cables to this day. For those who have cut the cord but still want their local channels coax cables are still a part of everyday life and therefore you’ll need a converter to enjoy network content on your TV.",,,,,,

After Pennsylvania’s biggest pension plan botched a crucial financial calculation the FBI launched an investigation the fund’s board began its own probe and 100000 public school employees suddenly faced paying more into the retirement system.

Now The Inquirer and Spotlight PA have obtained new internal fund documents that shed light on that consequential mistake. The material traces the error to “data corruption” in just one month — April 2015 — over the near-decade-long period reviewed for the calculation.

The error was small. It falsely boosted the $64 billion PSERS fund’s performance by only about a third of a percentage point over a financial quarter. Even so it was just enough to wrongly lift the fund’s financial returns over a key state-mandated hurdle used to gauge performance.

The documents reveal that a fund consultant Aon blamed the mistake on its clerical staff for inputting bad data. The material also shows that even though the fund hired a consultant the ACA Compliance Group to check the calculations the consultant made only limited checks and skipped over the month with the critical errors.

Experts say the fund pursued a flawed path from the beginning. They said the plan executives erred months before the bungled calculation by rejecting a warning that it avoid unaudited numbers — those not verified by independent analysts. That choice to use new untested numbers had the effect of making results look better than they really were. Then these critics said PSERS hamstrung the ACA review by limiting its scope.

As Robert Lavenberg a CPA and lawyer who formerly headed the accounting giant BDO’s pension audits said: If PSERS wanted to do a thorough review “you would do a clean sweep” and check all months not just some.

The headaches for PSERS — the Public School Employees’ Retirement System — began this spring when its board admitted endorsing a bad number for its investment profits. The mistake was significant because under a state pension reform known as risk-sharing working teachers and other school employees hired since 2011 must pay more to finance the pension system for 265000 retirees if returns fail to meet benchmarks.

The board had declared triumphantly last year that its investment strategies had paid off. It claimed to have put the fund over the benchmark hurdle sparing teachers and other staff from an increase. This April it reversed course and abandoned the old performance figure. It officially adopted a new lower one and announced that the workers would indeed pay more. The increase kicks in July 1.

The board had little choice but to fix the number. A top tax lawyer warned the board that failure to do so would be “catastrophic” and force half a million current and retired school workers to pay future income taxes on pensions immediately.

Soon after the board’s reversal The Inquirer reported that the FBI was investigating the calculation along with the fund’s spending on Harrisburg real estate. In subpoenas federal prosecutors have demanded every scrap of work paper from drafts to final versions from the pension fund and from consultants Aon and ACA dealing with the mistaken number.

PSERS has been conducting its own in-house probe. Records show that some involved with the review wonder whether the first figure was no mistake at all but a deliberate attempt to inflate the fund’s performance.

And in the documents obtained by The Inquirer and Spotlight PA state Treasury Department officials — Treasurer Stacy Garrity is a pension board member — asked: “Who determined or wrote the scope of work for the ACA project and how was it decided?”

ACA says it was not to blame and merely followed what it was asked to do. “ACA was hired to validate the calculation methodology over a defined period by testing on a sample basis not to validate or calculate the performance return” it said in a brief statement. “ACA performed the services it was engaged to provide — our calculation was based on the data provided to us which we now understand contained an error.”

Indeed in the documents consultant Aon a global firm with a $763000 PSERS contract says it was at fault for the bad numbers for April 2015. It blames the problem only on “inadvertent clerical mistakes at a data-entry level.”

In apologetic letters to the pension system Aon was contrite even as it played down the mistake.

“On behalf of Aon please know that we much appreciate PSERS patience as we have endeavored to unravel what very much appears to have been clerical data-entry mistakes however unfortunate” Steve Voss head of Aon’s Chicago-based North American Investments wrote on April 16.

In the letter the firm does not name the employee or employees who made the mistake. It declined to discuss the calculation as has PSERS.

Among the firm’s accounting tasks for the pension system perhaps its most crucial was to compile that performance figure. To do that Aon was required to review nine years of fund profits from mid-2011 to mid-2020. The fund had to clear a “hurdle” of a 6.36% average annual return to spare teachers and school employees a new levy — and the fund’s leadership embarrassment.

To be sure the bar seemed relatively low. After all the S&P 500 index of big U.S. stocks paid over 10% a year during those years.

But the test loomed amid mounting criticism that the plan had for many years posted lackluster returns at best and at worst was a dupe of price-gouging poor-performing hedge funds and private equity billionaires.

Moreover even before the calculation PSERS board member Joe Torsella then the state treasurer had been questioning the fund’s executive director Glen Grell about why Aon and Grell had gone back years to reenter and improve the performance of some fund investments using unaudited numbers. Grell replied that the changes were routine.

In sum while the pension fund had easily cleared two earlier “shared risk” exams in 2014 and 2017 the test for 2020 was a nail-biter. PSERS managers were nervous.

In a memo. Morgan Lewis one of at least three law firms hired by PSERS after the scandal broke said Aon was told about the fund’s anxiety about whether it would fall short or as the Philadelphia law firm put it “Aon was made aware of this sensitivity.”

Lavenberg questioned why Aon had been so alerted saying that might have telegraphed the leaders’ desired outcome to the consultant. “Wink wink. Nudge nudge” he said.

The board was also anxious enough that it hired ACA based in New York for $60000 to check up on Aon’s work.

The board majority in December 2020 said it had cleared the key hurdle — albeit barely. It voted to state officially that annual investments had grown by 6.38%.

Torsella and two others on the 15-member board abstained from the vote expressing doubts about the number. But the fund’s management insisted the new result was solid.

In fact fund leaders in a PowerPoint presentation to the board and in a statement to the media said Aon and ACA had both endorsed the figure.

“ACA confirmed the nine-year market value return as 6.38% which is higher than the 6.36% risk-share threshold” the board was told.

But had ACA in fact verified the number?

In an April 16 private memo to the board ACA explained its method was a sampling not a verification. In the same memo ACA explained why it had failed to catch the error. It said it sampled the math in only 40 of the 108 months over the review period from 2011 to 2020.

“April 2015 was not one of the months in ACA’s sample selection and therefore ACA did not detect missing cash flows in the AON calculations for that month” the firm wrote.

As it happens Torsella has long raised doubts about how the fund was measuring performance for the year 2015 — doing so months before the December vote.

Torsella first asked about the 2015 figures in a letter last August to Grell noting skeptically that the fund staff was using unaudited figures and boosting performance for the year “five years after the fact.”

Grell’s reply was that the fund had new and better data for the performance of some investments in private companies. Experts say the valuation of such private investments is inherently subjective unlike the explicit values placed on firms sold on stock markets.

John McLaughlin an auditor who runs his own firm in Newtown Square after stints with Aramark and BDO said the fund’s managers seemed in too much of a rush to approve the new numbers. “The board needs to push back [against management] if you need more time to get the right answer” McLaughlin said in an interview. “Don’t blame the accountant. Blame the management.”

None of the documents obtained by The Inquirer and Spotlight PA explore or even mention the role of PSERS management in the reevaluation of the 2015 figures.

But according to experts who reviewed the documents ACA in the end corrected PSERS’ data to the numbers its auditors had approved.

Said Lavenberg: “Why you would ever use an estimate if you had an audited number for that same period makes no sense whatever.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vY3lwcnVzLW1haWwuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjkvY3lwcnVzLXBlbnNpb24tZnVuZHMtZW1icmFjZS1lc2cv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cyprus 4.0: Cyprus pension funds embrace ESG,"“Most clients would consider ESG investments only if such investments are expected to enhance returns.

She is the lead Investment Consultant for a number of pension funds and Insurance companies here in Cyrus and abroad which she advises on strategic investment matters and implementation as well as providing general investment related support.

“When working with clients the first distinction we must make is whether the clients take it upon themselves to implement ESG or whether they outsource this to the asset managers engaging only with those who have embedded an ESG process. Most provident fund trustees do not feel that they can implement ESG on their own.

If a client decides to embrace ESG there are different levels of doing this.

The first level is what we call “Socially responsible investing”. It’s a selection process whereby you screen out “negative” stocks meaning stocks that have unethical aspects to them like pornography or private prisons relating tp Iran or Sudan fossil fuels companies that are involved in bribery tax evasion etc.

There are easy ways of doing this by investing in ESG screened funds.

So it’s very easy to just buy a “screened” fund and this is how most of the clients start”

But it’s possible to go much farther in ESG taxonomy Anastassiades says.

“The second step it’s a bit more of a “positive” selection process. So it’s not just negatively screening out “bad” investments but incorporating an ESG integration – it integrates specific environmental social and governance criteria into the investment analysis but again to the extend that this is material to the investment performance.

This means dropping (or even shorting) companies from a portfolio with negative ESG issues but then also finding and investing more in companies that have good ESG score or which make socially useful choices.

Up to this level clients make ESG investment choices that are expected to enhance returns. There are organisations of course that are willing to take risks on ESG investments that may not enhance returns necessarily. We see that many clients don’t necessarily look at ESG investing with an eye strictly to do the right thing. But international and local pressure has made it absolutely necessary along with new regulations.

On 8 March 2021 the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) issued a statement in which it made a commitment to fostering compliance with sustainable finance standards in accordance with the EU action plan for financing sustainable growth. This is in line with EU Directive 2016/2341 which sets ESG criteria for pension funds and which Cyprus transposed into national law 10(I) 2020.

Some clients however go well beyond regulatory compliance and social pressure in their application of ESG.

“At the next level is what we call impact investment which is a selection process a positive selection process where we look for investments that have both a positive investment return but also a social economic and environmental outcome. So that’s quite an important distinction for us. This would mean finding investments in alternative energy or micro funding minority-owned business things like that.

And then of course there are companies and investors whose goals prioritise doing good above investment returns. We call this mission-related investment; it’s your mission to contribute to the greater good to make a change in the world and thus investing in companies that complement the your mission.

This means investing in health care or senior issues or child issues etc. Among our clients however going all the way to impact investment is quite difficult. And it’s probably not their job as they are guardians of members money. So most of them stay in the first two categories that I mentioned the one is negatively screening out companies and the other one involves positively and negatively selecting companies.

To attain these goals we advise them on choosing a manager who understands their objectives who will implement this in in a professional way. And they usually integrate that into what they call their statement investment principles so that the next generation of administrative committees will follow suit.”

Indeed one should not forget that most clients do expect good returns on ESG investment.

“It’s much more a question of selecting ESG-compliant stocks/funds that offer a good return ideally a better return than they had been getting before. Some companies have already for some years been active in screening out negative stocks. .”

Generally speaking available studies suggest ESG’s impact on performance has been neutral to positive as a result of negative screening. It is important to note however that these studies have been conducted over a relatively short period of time – less than a full market cycle and primarily in a bull market environment

There seems to be consensus that ESG investment not only does good but returns should do better than other investment choices as they are more sustainable in the long term.

Anastassiades thinks this view is somewhat premature.

“Obviously investing for impact will eventually have a good return (maybe not for years). And if a company is unable to sustain its resources it is unlikely to make a profit thus sustainable companies will prevail. But this is a very long-term view. In the shorter term it’s not been that clear that increased returns are coming through ESG investment. We will just have to wait a fairly long time to see these results.

There is clearly progress to be made in both understanding ESG and in putting it into practice.

I think most people understand the green energy part and are increasingly coming to support it. But there is less understanding of the need to support other ESG investments like minority-owned businesses or child issues or senior citizen issues. They understand those less not because they are complicated concepts  but because they simply haven’t paid attention to the S & G (‘social’ and ‘governance’) parts of the ESG and mostly focused on the “E” (‘environmental’).”

And what about Cyprus? Are we seeing progress here?

“We are not doing badly. Compared to other EU countries I think we are lagging behind a bit. Compared to the rest of the world Europe is doing better. There is still some progress to be made. There are some very good investment managers in Cyprus and many companies are moving forward with the ESG agenda.”

With all this impressive change and transformation underway at all these pension funds and companies do you feel ESG is making a difference?

“I think it is a very good thing. Pension funds are among the biggest players in the investment world. And the inclusion of ESG into their process of making investment choices is a very very positive thing. It will have a big impact in the future. It is a slow process but we are getting there. Most of the people in the industry have engaged in the green energy part of it as mentioned before. We still need to see more engagement in the social aspects of ESG directives. And I think the pension funds given that you save for your own retirement will become more of a sensitive to ESG issue. As this change in mindset comes and people engage with ESG to have an impact it will make a difference in the implementation of ESG and that is only going to be very good for everyone. It is a growing trend driven both top-down and bottom-up demand.”",,,,,,,,,

What is Amazon Prime Day?

Founder Jeff Bezos and company pitched the first Prime Day as a celebration of Amazon's 20th anniversary

Amazon Prime Day is an annual shopping holiday designed to rival events like BF and Cyber Monday. The sale lasts two days typically in mid-July.

Amazon staggers many shorter deals throughout the two-day event. It includes many limited-time discounts that may only last several hours. High-demand items frequently sell out before the deal expires.

Amazon announces some deals in advance — often including Amazon-made devices like Kindle and Echo. However ""Flash Deals"" often remain a mystery until they go live on the website.

The surprise factor encourages customers to check back continually leading to unplanned purchases. The continual discovery of new offers can also bring about non-stop media coverage essentially providing Amazon with free advertising throughout the entire two-day event.

FAQ

Here's a rundown of frequently asked questions about the annual shopping holiday:

Amazon Prime Day 2024 starts in July 2024 although exact dates have yet to be announced.

Per the company's blog post:

Prime Day will take place in the following countries: Australia Austria Belgium Brazil Canada Egypt France Germany India Italy Japan Luxembourg Mexico Netherlands Poland Portugal Saudi Arabia Singapore Spain Sweden Turkey the United Arab Emirates the U.S. and the UK.

Prime Day 2022 occurred on July 12 and 13 with a Prime Early Access Sale following on October 11 and 12 that provided shoppers with early access to holiday deals. Prime Day 2023 ran July 11-12 2023 and a second Prime Day called Prime Big Deal Days is set for October 11-12.

From 2015 to 2019 Amazon held Prime Day in mid-July. The online seller held the first Prime Day in honor of the website's 20th anniversary that month.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic Amazon pushed back the 2020 event to October.

The mid-July timeframe was reinstated in 2022.

Does Amazon Prime Day include Apple deals?

Yes. The 2022 iteration featured a hefty discount on the Apple Watch Series 7 discounting it by $120 with prices as low as $279. AirPods with Wired Case were also on sale for $89.99 the cheapest price seen in 2022.

In 2021 the sale included numerous Apple products including AirPods deals for $60 off $120 off an Apple Watch Series 6 and up to $200 off M1 MacBooks.

In 2019 Amazon became an official Apple Authorized Reseller. Llistings described as both ""sold by"" and ""ships from"" Amazon.com are guaranteed to be official Apple products.

In recent years Prime Day deals have included Apple accessories

Third-party resellers can sell Apple products on Amazon but they may present some risk of receiving counterfeits open-box items listed as new or other issues.

Viewing seller ratings and reviews can help shoppers discern whether a particular deal is trustworthy.

When was it held in the past?

Amazon's official Prime Day events have fallen on the following dates:

2015 - July 15

2016 - July 12

2017 - July 11 and 12

2018 - July 16 and 17

2019 - July 15 and 16

2020 - October 13 and 14

2021 - June 21 and 22

2022 - July 12 and 13

2023 - July 11 and 12

Amazon postponed the 2020 event due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company returned to running the sale in the normal July spot for 2022.

Does Amazon Prime Day have good deals?

Amazon's sales often provide steep discounts from standard retail pricing.

In 2015 the event's first year customers complained that most sale items were far from popular. Social media users criticized the event for serving as little more than an ""Amazon garage sale.""

Today Amazon's shopping event has much better deals than in its divisive first year

However the company began offering more appealing sale items in subsequent years. In 2016 Amazon said customers placed 60% more orders than in the first year.

Today Prime Day's high-profile deals are much closer to Black Friday sales than they were at the beginning.

Does it require a Prime Membership?

Yes Prime Day deals are only available to Amazon Prime members. An Amazon Prime subscription costs $139 annually or $14.99 per month. The pricing for a Prime Membership has increased in the past year but trials are available and may be utilized during Prime Day to take part in the deals available for purchase.

Is there a Prime student discount?

Yes Amazon has a Prime student discount program. Students can pay $69 per year or $7.49 per month. Currently you may try Amazon Prime Student with a free 6-month trial. Following the trial you'll pay just $7.49 a month. Students are required to submit documentation to verify their eligibility.

How much money do customers save?

Amazon says that customers saved $1.7 billion during the 2022 shopping event.

What are the most popular items?

According to Amazon its Amazon Music promotions offered the best deal ever for Prime members and drove more sign-ups for Amazon Music Unlimited worldwide than any other Prime Day.

The company listed top-selling item types excluding Amazon devices from several other regions:

United States: Waterpik Electric Water Flosser

Germany and Austria: Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Android Tablet

France: Philips OneBlade replacement blades

Singapore: Vita Coco Natural Coconut Water

Australia: DualSense Wireless Controller for the PlayStation 5

United Arab Emirates: Fairy Lemon Dishwashing Liquid Soap

Amazon says the Fire TV Stick 4K with Alexa Voice Remote was the most popular global purchase. The company also mentioned that customers purchased a record-setting number of Fire TVs from brands including Toshiba and Insignia.

How much money do third-party sellers make?

According to an Amazon press release with 2023 stats:

The first day of Prime Day July 11 was the single largest sales day in company history.

Ce dernier sera détruit en 1689. Cette rue était le seul axe assurant la liaison entre l’usine et le centre-ville (l’accès au Jeu-du-Mail n’existait pas alors). Le percement du calvaire se fera vers 1950.

En aval de ce pont se dressait l’imposant moulin farinier dit d’Encolomiès usine de faux et taillanderie appelé Moulin des Carmes qui fut reconstruit au XVe siècle. En septembre 1481 le seigneur Durfort d’Unzent fait une demande à la ville en précisant ""que le moulin d’Encoloumiès dont la moitié est la propriété de la ville fut fait en arceaux et qu’il a trouvé quelqu’un pour le bâtir en arche. L’autorité communale le tiendra quitte des réparations à faire et de sa taille pour dix ans. La ville vend sa part du moulin farinier en 1601 mais le rachète en 1618. Au XIXe siècle il est affermé par J-.B. Sans dans le but d’établir une usine de faux.

En 1852 l’architecte de la ville préconise la reconstruction du pont devenu vétuste et impropre à la circulation. En 1859 un traité est conclu entre la ville et l’entreprise Abat-Anduze-Faris & Cie pour la construction du pont en fonte de fer. Il sera élargi au XXe lors de la reconstruction du quartier du Pont-Neuf. Ce vieux moulin a aujourd’hui disparu et des vestiges témoignent de son existence notamment la chute d’eau.

Au XIXe en remontant vers le centre-ville on trouvait l’imposante église romane des Carmes qui fut reconstruite en 1394 par les jésuites. Ce monument était très austère et obscur à l’intérieur et peu fréquenté par les pratiquants. La place Boulbonne située en face assurait la liaison entre la halle et le quartier moyenâgeux du Pont-Neuf. Sur celle-ci se déroulait chaque année la fête du quartier. Le journal La Démocratie de l’Ariège relatait la fête du 22 juin 1884 : ""La fête a été charmante. Les lanternes vénitiennes mêlées à la verte fraîcheur des arbres étaient splendides. La pluie n’a pas refroidi l’enthousiasme de nos aimables danseuses et de leurs vaillants cavaliers. À une heure fort avancée ils se sont séparés aux cris de ""Vive la République"" en se donnant rendez-vous pour la fête de Sainte-Hélène"".

Au cours du XXe siècle le secteur va subir une grande mutation. En 1916 la halle de la place de la République est détruite en 1932 le bureau de poste est édifié un square est aménagé avec 3 bassins et jets d’eau des bancs sans oublier la végétation. Puis en 1972 l’église des Carmes est détruite pour laisser la place à un central téléphonique. À partir de 1975 le quartier du Pont-Neuf va être rasé. Sur l’ancienne place des Carmes des barres d’immeubles d’appartements locatifs et d’accession à la propriété vont être édifiées sans oublier les parkings. Ce quartier jadis très animé a perdu aujourd’hui toute la joie de vivre d’antan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vdWVzdC1mcmFuY2UuZnIvZWxlY3Rpb25zL2RlcGFydGVtZW50YWxlcy9lbGVjdGlvbnMtZGVwYXJ0ZW1lbnRhbGVzLWNhbnRvbi1sZS1tYW5zLTQtbWljaGVsLXZpYWxlLWV0LXdhbHRyYXVkLWVzbmVlLWNhbmRpZGF0cy01YTYzM2ZhZS1jMTQ2LTExZWItODA1Yy04Y2RhZjIwYjg2MTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Élections départementales.

Imprimer

Un vraquier – Ekaterina – naviguant sous le pavillon maltais vers le port de Radès a suscité dimanche 30 mai 2021 une vive polémique sur les réseaux sociaux.

L’Union générale tunisienne du travail (UGTT) s’est saisie de l’affaire assurant que le navire effectuait des liaisons directes entre la station portuaire tunisienne et le port d'Ashdod un des deux principaux ports de fret d'Israël.

Dans une publication sur sa page Facebook la Centrale syndicale a crié au scandale assurant que le Bulk Carrier maltais ferait son entrée dans le port de Radès dans la soirée de dimanche.

L’UGTT a exigé la saisie du navire et l’ouverture d’une enquête dénonçant une opération de normalisation avec l’Etat sioniste.

En réaction aux allégations de l’UGTT l’Office de la Marine marchande et des Ports a publié un communiqué explicatif affirmant d’abord que le navire avait fait deux entrées dans le port de Radès en 2021.

Il a précisé qu’en date du 31 mars Ekaterina avait fait une entrée dans les eaux tunisiennes en provenance de la ville portuaire bulgare Varna avec une cargaison de 27500 tonnes de blé à destination de l’Office des céréales.

L’Office de la Marine marchande a ajouté que le navire s’était amarré le 5 mai dans le port de Radès pour le quitter le 22 mai directement après avoir déchargé sa cargaison.

Il a publié par ailleurs la liste des ports que le navire a fréquenté avant son arrivée en Tunisie soulignant que l’Office examine impérativement l’identité et les trajets des bateaux avant de leur accorder l’autorisation d’entrée réfutant ainsi les accusations de l’UGTT.

(1:19)

Open Extended Reactions

The Indiana Pacers have submitted 78 instances of incorrect or non-calls to the NBA that they felt put them at a disadvantage in Games 1 and 2 against the New York Knicks a league source told ESPN.

Pacers coach Rick Carlisle speaking after Indiana fell behind 2-0 in the Eastern Conference semifinals with a 130-121 loss to New York on Wednesday said the team had identified 29 questionable refereeing decisions from Game 1. The source said the Pacers then identified 49 plays from Game 2 that they felt were incorrectly called or not called at all and submitted them overnight to the NBA office.

Carlisle said they had decided not to send the Game 1 calls to the league office for review but reversed that decision after Game 2 had similar officiating issues from their perspective.

As part of NBA protocol the clips will also be shared with the Knicks.

""I can promise you that we're going to submit these tonight"" Carlisle said after being ejected in the final minute when he was given two technical fouls. ""New York can get ready. They'll see 'em too. I'm always talking to our guys about not making it about the officials but we deserve a fair shot.""

A frustrated Carlisle also implied the Pacers were being penalized by officials because they were playing against the league's largest market.

""Small-market teams deserve an equal shot"" Carlisle said. ""They deserve a fair shot no matter where they're playing.""

Carlisle was ejected after growing upset about several calls in Game 2 particularly when officials correctly reversed a double-dribble violation that could have given the Pacers a key possession with the outcome still in doubt.

In Game 1 a kicked ball violation was called in error against the Pacers but not corrected a decision that ended up costing the team three vital points during the 121-117 loss.

The Madison Square Garden crowd which was elated when star Jalen Brunson returned in the second half after missing the entire second quarter to deal with a right foot issue made the environment hostile for the Pacers and Carlisle said he believed it affected the officiating to favor the Knicks.

The Pacers will have to examine their defensive film as well. After allowing the Knicks to shoot 65% in the second half in Game 1 as they lost a lead New York shot 67% in the third quarter of Game 2 and flipped the game outscoring Indiana 36-18 behind Brunson's return.

Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton who scored 34 points in bouncing back from putting up six in Game 1 wasn't going to put all the blame on the officiating.

""Let's not pretend like [officiating] is the only reason we lost. We just didn't play good enough"" Haliburton said. ""We just got to be better.""

One other issue for the Pacers to review as the series moves to Indianapolis for Game 3 on Friday (7 p.m. ET ESPN) is how to guard Brunson. Backup guard T.J. McConnell was somewhat effective in slowing Brunson in Games 1 and 2 but Carlisle took him out with seven minutes to play and the Knicks up two points replacing him with starter Andrew Nembhard.

Brunson scored 10 of his 29 points down the stretch with Nembhard as his primary defender and is 14-of-21 shooting for 33 points against Nembhard over the first two games according to ESPN Stats & Information. Carlisle said he considered bringing McConnell who had a +10 plus/minus on the night back in but decided against it because it wasn't how the team has played throughout the season.

McConnell supported his coach's decision.

""Rick is a Hall of Fame coach and has been doing this for a long time so the rotations that he plays we trust that they're the right ones and I fully support him"" McConnell said. ""Whenever my number is called I'll be ready.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L2J1c2luZXNzL3dhbGwtc3RyZWV0LWJhbmtlcnMtZGVhdGgtaWduaXRlcy1hbmdlci1hdC1sb25nLXdvcmt3ZWVrcy1jb3VsZC1wcm9tcHQtd2Fsa291dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall Street banker's death ignites anger at long workweeks could prompt walkout,"The death of a Bank of America associate last week has ignited a firestorm on Wall Street as some bankers slam the toxic work culture they feel contributed to his death — including reported complaints over 100-hour workweeks.

Leo Lukenas III a former Green Beret who was part of the bank’s Financial Institutions Group died of “acute coronary artery thrombus” at age 35 last Thursday according to a Reuters report.

He leaves behind a wife and two young children.

His death came after he had allegedly been working some 100 hours a week for several weeks in a row on a $2 billion merger that was completed last Monday — three days before his tragic death.

Much of the outcry on social media site Reddit from purported bank staffers has been directed at Lukenas’ boss Gary Howe co-head of the financial institutions group. Howe took down his LinkedIn page during the last few days.

Some employees have reportedly messaged each other about a possible walkout in an effort to bargain for better working conditions according to popular financial website and chat board Wall Street Oasis.

One post from an anonymous banker highlighted a list of demands for employees’ welfare that generated more than 450 comments in response.

The demands include “proactive policies” that cap work schedules at an average of 80 hours over a seven-day period and that employees get at least one weekend off per month. It also called for an investigation into Lukenas’ death.

So far workers have remained at their desks — in part because they fear retribution for raising concerns about the toxic culture sources said.

A Bank of America spokesperson did not comment about a possible walkout or the accusations of retribution when reached by The Post.

The rep said the bank has no plans to take any action against Howe or to investigate complaints that its junior bankers are forced to put in 100-hour weeks.

“We are very saddened by the loss of our teammate. We continue to focus on doing whatever we can to support the family and our team especially those who worked closely with him” the BoA spokesperson told The Post.

Howe did not reply to multiple requests for comment.

Lukena who lived in Brooklyn had been a Green Beret for more than a decade — from 2013 until he joined the bank as a full-time employee last July — according to his LinkedIn page.

He posted news about the deal between UMB Financial and Heartland Financial on LinkedIn days before his death.

He was a member of 51 Vets a nonprofit dedicated to connecting transitioning and transitioned veterans from elite military communities with leading businesses according to its website.

“51 Vets completely changed the trajectory of my post military career. Outstanding organization with an incredible mission” Lukenas had recently posted on LinkedIn.

A fundraiser for his family launched by 51 Vets has already raised $258962 as of early Thursday afternoon including $10000 from hedge fund titan Bill Ackman.

“This was an organic campaign organized by our members” 51 Vets founder Jordan Selleck told The Post.

“This speaks to the pain in the veteran community and Leo’s reputation in the community.”

“On May 2nd 2024 51 Vets lost a father husband son Green Beret and member” 51 Vets says on its site.

“Leo left behind a wife and two young children. Leo spent over a decade in Army Special Operations deploying multiple times with 1st Special Forces Group. He was dedicated to everything he did never settling for good enough. He always set the example and held himself to the highest standards prioritizing the team and mission success over himself.”

Lukenas’ dedication to work is why some on Wall Street are quick to link his passing to a culture they believe values wealth over well-being.

While there is no direct evidence to suggest his work had anything to do with his death numerous studies have linked acute stress to thrombosis.

Lukenas’ shocking death reopened a longstanding debate on Wall Street about a bank’s responsibility to employees.

More than a decade ago Moritz Erhardt a 21-year-old intern at Bank of America in London died after working until 6 a.m. three nights in a row.

A coroner concluded that Erhardt’s death from an epileptic seizure that limited his oxygen supply may have been triggered by fatigue.

Following his death banks made an effort to restrict employee work hours.

That discussion was reignited in 2021 after a PowerPoint presentation compiled by 13 Goldman Sachs junior bankers and calling out brutal workweeks leaked to the popular Wall Street influencer Litquidity.

“What is not ok to me is 110-120 hours over the course of a week! The math is simple that leaves 4 hours for eating sleeping showering bathroom and general transition time. This is beyond the level of ‘hard-working’ it is inhuman/ abuse” one analyst wrote at the time.

In response banks began hiring more staff to lighten junior employees’ workloads and limit hours.

But over the last year as Wall Street profits dropped and firms prepared for a possible recession several banks — including Bank of America — cut the workforce once again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbGlzaC5jb20vZm9vZC1uZXdzL2E2MDc0NDU5NS90cmF2aXMta2VsY2UtY2xhaW1zLWFsd2F5cy1kcnVuay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travis Kelce Is Clapping Back At Claims He's 'Always Drunk',"Earlier this week country singer and actor Jana Kramer took to her podcast to well slander Travis Kelce's name. The iHeart Radio host dissed the Kansas City Chiefs tight end for his drinking habits and claimed he's ""always drunk."" Now Kelce is hitting back via multiple insiders.

""He was taken aback as he’s never met her and is just living his life"" the source told Page Six while ""emphatically"" denying any suggestion the athlete has a drinking problem. ""That guy is under a microscope basically being watched everywhere he goes. Of course you're going to see him drinking"" the source said.

Kramer even took aim at Kelce's influence on his girlfriend Taylor Swift arguing that he has encouraged the singer's consumption habits.

""I see her drinking more now. Like the company you keep"" Kramer alleged while also calling Kelce out for his ""aggression"" with coach Andy Reid during the Super Bowl. It ""rubbed [her] the wrong way.""

The same insider went on to argue that if Kelce did have a drinking problem it would be impossible to hide given his status and constant

""It’s not like he’s passed out somewhere. If he was passed out somewhere I would totally understand but that’s not the case whatsoever"" the source adds while noting that he's just a ""normal human being"" who is ""doing the same thing"" as everyone else...only ""in the public eye.""

The three-time Super Bowl champ is reportedly ""in training right now"" to prepare for another season with the Chiefs. ""If he was drunk it would be a bigger problem"" the source said.

This isn't the first time Kelce has come under fire for drinking. During his honorary graduation ceremony for his ""New Heights"" podcast Travis accepted the diploma he never picked up in the first place before chugging a beer in celebration. However big brother Jason was quick to his defense.

""I know it looks like a graduation from the video but this was actually at the end of a New Heights Live podcast that we put on to raise money for the University’s NIL"" the older Kelce said according to People Magazine. ""The university did this to poke fun at my brother and I for never really picking up our diplomas.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d0b3AuY29tL2RjLzIwMjQvMDUvcG9saWNlLWluc3RhbGwtZmVuY2luZy1hcm91bmQtZm9ybWVyLWd3LWVuY2FtcG1lbnQtc2F5LTExLW9mLTMzLWFycmVzdGVkLWlkZW50aWZpZWQtdGhlbXNlbHZlcy1hcy1zdHVkZW50cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pro-Palestinian protesters disperse after police presence at GWU campus; at least 1 arrested,"A groups of around 100 protesters linked arms and encircled several tents.

Pro-Palestinian protesters returned to the George Washington University and pitched tents on campus Thursday night just one day after police cleared an encampment on the D.C. campus arresting dozens of people.

A group of around 100 pro-Palestinian protesters linked arms and encircled several tents along F Street in Foggy Bottom on Thursday night. Demonstrators chanted for around five hours at times in heavy rain.

Around 11:30 p.m. D.C. police gave its first warning to the demonstrators to disperse from the area or face arrests for unlawful entry and trespassing on campus property. Many protesters could be seen collecting their signs and packing up tents and leaving the area.

After the sixth warning MPD officers linked arms and began advancing on the protesters until 19th and F streets according to 7News’ Christian Flores who was on the scene and told WTOP. He said many of the organizers and protesters decided to leave on their own.

“We haven’t seen any [response from university officials] late this evening. It is pretty calm” Flores said as protestors were leaving the area of the university. “So it does appear that there was a plan in place by MPD to not only disperse the protesters but also to make sure there wasn’t any sort of second gathering after that dispersal order.”

Police confirmed to WTOP that one arrest was made for assault on an officer.

As the campus encampment approached the two-week mark Wednesday D.C. police broke up the gathering and arrested 33 pro-Palestinian demonstrators. Six of those arrested are current students the university said in a statement Thursday.

After that clearing of the tents dozens of protesters came back to campus and gathered at the intersection of 21st and H Street early Thursday evening before marching to F Street at around 8 p.m.

Seemingly peaceful

The group carried signs that read “We are not leaving” and chanted “Free free Palestine.” Marchers paused in front of the residence that’s traditionally occupied by the university’s president Ellen Granberg and chanted outside the home.

Then they marched down F Street where several administrative offices are also located — including Granberg’s office.

That’s where protesters put up nine tents the university’s student newspaper The Hatchet reported. Some participants also climbed the brick entrance to a university building nearby the tents.

WTOP's Scott Gelman reports from George Washington University as pro-Palestinian protesters return to campus.

Dozens of D.C. police officers some on bikes gathered on F Street and the surrounding area.

WTOP’s Scott Gelman reported a brief moment of pushing and shoving earlier in the evening when police on bicycles appeared to be attempting to control a sidewalk in front of a university building.

Outside of that scuffle the protest appeared to have remained peaceful.

WTOP has reached out to the university for comment. D.C. police told WTOP the department is monitoring the First Amendment activity.

Protesters are back. Here’s how students are reacting

Among those in the crowd on H Street was GW student Reem Lababdi who told WTOP she was pepper sprayed in the back by D.C. police but not arrested Wednesday.

“We said we weren’t leaving and we meant it” Lababdi said in reference to the encampment. “We will not be pushed aside when our administration is funding the genocide of our people.”

Students from other nearby colleges including American University George Mason and the University of Maryland took part in the protests on GW’s campus.

Lababdi said protesters are there to send a message to Mayor Muriel Bowser congressional lawmakers and Granberg whom she criticized for allegedly declining to meet with student protesters.

“She would sooner brutalize her own students than come to the negotiating table with them” Lababdi said.

But there’s division among GW students about the protests.

David Delarosa a GW student told WTOP he encountered protesters on H Street while returning home from work Thursday.

“We have students here who just want to go to work want to go finish their finals go home enjoy their summer” he said. “It’s ridiculous.”

Protest organizers have called accusations that the demonstrations are antisemitic “baseless.” But some Jewish students have said they feel intimidated by the protests.

“Jews like myself feel threatened they feel scared and we just want to live our lives” he said.

Barriers around site of former encampment

The events Thursday come after fencing was installed around the GW’s University Yard. The fence barriers standing over 10 feet tall resemble those put in place around the Capitol building after the Jan. 6 2021 insurrection — and are now blocking all entrances of University Yard.

It is unclear how long the fences are expected to remain around the area.

When asked at a Wednesday news conference whether the encampment clearing meant there would be no more protests on GW’s campus D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith said it was Granberg’s decision “to determine if she will allow protests in other areas of the campus.”

Smith said that no protests will take place in the now-secured area.

Smith said there were many indicators that the protests were becoming more volatile outlining intelligence that officers had been collecting over the days leading up to Wednesday. One of the concerning indicators Smith mentioned was that non-students were joining the protests on campus and had been found in secure campus buildings.

Granberg also said in a statement over the weekend that the protest had “been co-opted by individuals who are largely unaffiliated with our community and do not have our community’s best interest in mind.”

Arrest records show that the 33 arrested protesters ranged in age from 18 to 33 years old.

Tensions have continued to ratchet up in standoffs with protesters on campuses across the U.S. — and increasingly in Europe — nearly three weeks into a movement launched by a protest at Columbia University in New York.

Some colleges cracked down immediately on protests against the Israel-Hamas war. Among those that have tolerated the tent encampments some universities have begun to lose patience and call in police over concerns about disruptions to campus life safety and the involvement of nonstudents.

Since April 18 just over 2600 people have been arrested on 50 campuses according to figures based on reporting by The Associated Press and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies.

But when Erik ten Hag recorded his first win at Manchester United back in August 2022 there was something uneasy about the performance. It was an important 2-1 home victory over Liverpool but it was not achieved with Erik ten Hag football.

Ten Hag compromised. After briefly attempting to impose Ajax-style principles at United and getting convincingly beaten by both Brighton and Hove Albion and then Brentford — 4-0 on the latter occasion — Ten Hag went back to basics. United had spells of pressure in the early stages through aggressive pressing. They scored two well-worked goals. But their best moments came on the break. They ground out the victory.

In many ways it was understandable given United’s prior difficulties and Ten Hag’s obvious fear of starting his United career with three straight defeats. But it was largely simplistic football the type that had often allowed them to pinch results under Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. We once asked what United’s attacking plan was under those coaches. We’re asking the same thing under Ten Hag partly because that win over Liverpool set the template. By the end of last season Ten Hag’s United had scored the most counter-attacking goals in the league. In terms of non-counter-attacking goals — everything from open play to set pieces to penalties — United ranked just ninth.

Really in keeping with his predecessors the story is not simply that Ten Hag has failed. The story is that he’s failed after doing well in his first season. After all Louis van Gaal took United to fourth in his first season. Mourinho won the League Cup and the Europa League. Solskjaer had a positive caretaker spell and then finished second. Ralf Rangnick had er a very energetic 45 minutes against Crystal Palace.

And Ten Hag let’s not forget took United to third place last season his side kept the highest number of clean sheets in the Premier League and he reached both domestic cup finals. Since then however United have gone backwards in almost every respect and while the finger-pointing is always at individuals it’s the absence of collective concepts that are most concerning when it comes to assessing the manager’s future.

United’s third-place finish last season was impressive but the underlying numbers were less convincing. In fact goal difference probably doesn’t even qualify as an underlying number but +15 was a curiously low figure for a team in third. The previous 10 third-placed finishers in the Premier League averaged a goal difference of +35. United were thrashed three times (4-0 v Brentford 6-3 by Manchester City 7-0 by Liverpool) but didn’t record any victories of more than three goals.

This season has featured a 3-0 loss to Bournemouth and a 4-0 loss to Crystal Palace and only four victories by more than a single goal (Everton twice plus West Ham and Sheffield United at home). Therefore the club’s goal difference column is -3 at the moment. There are more examples of Ten Hag’s system collapsing spectacularly than working fluidly.

There are mitigating circumstances. United have suffered from terrible injury problems in defence. Lisandro Martinez was not merely outstanding throughout last season; he was the poster boy for what Ten Hag seemed to want from everyone else. He helped United play out from the back and was aggressive in his ball-winning. He also had a good understanding with Raphael Varane. But Martinez hasn’t completed 90 minutes since August and defensive colleagues have also gone down injured. That’s meant United’s most-used centre-back this season has been Harry Maguire and while the club captain has never been as much of a liability as the meme-based mocking would suggest he’s an entirely different type of defender necessarily having to play deeper.

Lisandro Martinez has appeared in only nine league games in his second season (Michael Regan/Getty Images)

That has grated. After all United released David de Gea to bring in Andre Onana and help United become more Ajax-like. Onana has been inconsistent but overall a positive — his underlying numbers suggest he’s been one of the better goalkeepers in the league. But shot-stopping wasn’t really the thing United were trying to improve — De Gea was past his best but to reiterate he kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League last season. United were attempting to introduce a goalkeeper more adept on the ball but amidst the chopping and changing in front of him and the absence of another Ajax old boy in Martinez the stylistic evolution hasn’t occurred.

It’s striking how often United go long in situations where other top sides would play out. Last season according to Opta 37 per cent of United’s goalkeeper passes were ‘launched’ — that is played more than 40 yards. This season it’s 36 per cent. Granted not all long passes are the same and Onana’s distribution is clearly more assured than De Gea’s but the build-up is no more patient.

And if there’s been a lack of cohesion between goalkeeper and defence wait until you see the relationship between defence…

…and midfield which is a bit like that paragraphing.

Ten Hag is presiding over a team with a defence that naturally retreats and a midfield that pushes up to man-mark. The consequence has been an alarming amount of space between the lines. If Casemiro could once cover that space alone — and at times last season he did so expertly — this season he has not merely struggled to occupy the space but exacerbated the amount of space by storming into challenges he can’t win. Kobbie Mainoo looks excellent in possession but has been exposed by the openness of the system. Scott McTominay is a very useful footballer but also a midfielder who doesn’t actually contribute anything in midfield.

That’s led to an alarming number of goals conceded from cutbacks towards the edge of the box like this one against Nottingham Forest…

… or this one against Tottenham…

… or… in fairness this one against Brentford is a little harsh because it’s in the aftermath of a set-piece situation in the final minute but this does feel quite typical.

In attack? Well for all the talk about managerial philosophies this is the area where managers are most flexible. They are generally happy to adapt to the players at their disposal. Pep Guardiola has won the European Cup with a false nine like Lionel Messi and a proper nine like Erling Haaland. Jurgen Klopp’s Dortmund had selfless wide players serving brilliant central players and his Liverpool had selfless central players serving brilliant wide players. But most successful sides have a clear technical leader someone who dominates their attack.

United don’t have one — partly through design partly through circumstance partly through Ten Hag’s mismanagement.

The design? Ten Hag largely played the Cristiano Ronaldo situation brilliantly dropping him for that first victory over Liverpool easing him out gradually and then letting him storm off in a huff.

The circumstance? Marcus Rashford was voted United’s player of the year last season but his form has nosedived dramatically this time around. This from the outside appears more about Rashford than anything Ten Hag has done.

The mismanagement? Antony has proved a wretched signing and was clearly one of Ten Hag’s own. Meanwhile Jadon Sancho is a Champions League finalist. There are two sides to that particular story but ultimately Ten Hag had a disastrous falling out with a potentially key individual.

With Rasmus Hojlund struggling for goals before Christmas United have gone back to a reliance on Bruno Fernandes. He isn’t capable of the consistent brilliance that largely bailed out Solskjaer and even then was always an individualist rather than a system player. Incidentally a sign of United’s ability to build a long-term approach is the fact they’ve had seven different top scorers in their last seven seasons. Hojlund is currently one goal behind Fernandes this season and could make it eight in eight.

Ultimately Manchester United have not adjusted to Ten Hag’s approach; Ten Hag has adjusted to Manchester United’s. The Dutchman has struggled to reshape the club not purely through his own failings but also because of individual underperformance and long-running issues upstairs. But Ten Hag must admit his failings and it’s not solely about tactics. He hasn’t come across as a confident leader with a clear plan. Mourinho and Van Gaal brought some level of confidence. Solskjaer inevitably felt at home. But Ten Hag rather like Moyes and Rangnick has looked uneasy and has been unimpressive in terms of communication.

There’s no reason Ten Hag shouldn’t be in line for other jobs — in six years with Ajax and Manchester United the first five were successful and only one has been a failure. Indeed his four-year spell of taking Ajax to first place (albeit one of the seasons ended early because of Covid-19) now looks even more impressive. It was preceded by four years without a title under his predecessors and has been followed by two years without a title under his successors. And he wouldn’t be the first to enjoy success after Manchester United; Moyes and Mourinho won the first two editions of the UEFA Conference League while Van Gaal and Rangnick have experienced highs in international football.

But there’s little case for keeping Ten Hag around. Results have gone backwards. Performances have too. But more than anything there’s just no sense of what Ten Hag is working towards. He could still bow out on a high like his compatriot Van Gaal by winning the FA Cup in a repeat of last year’s final against Manchester City.

The problem isn’t that United will go into that game as underdogs — it’s that they are still most comfortable playing as underdogs.

The Byte reports that the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has teamed up with Sony Doshisha University and toy maker Tomy on a ball-shaped transforming robot to study the lunar soil ahead of a crewed rover due in 2029.

The 8.8oz bot will arrive in a compact ball that will help the private robotics company Ispace carry the machine aboard its lunar lander. Once on the surface it'll pop open into a ""full"" configuration that captures images of the Moon's surface. This will also make the robot useful for future missions JAXA said.

The contributions aren't completely surprising. Sony (which knows a thing about rolling robots) provided the control technology for the robot while Tomy and Doshisha helped miniaturize the design. Work on the robot started with a study in 2016 but the effort mainly solidified with Sony's entrance in 2019 and Doshisha's in 2021.

Ispace will launch its lander and the transfomer robot in 2022. We wouldn't count on seeing many space exploration robots like this but this project hints at a future where shapeshifting designs let landers either carry previously impractical robots or reduce the size of the host vehicle itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,

He walked over to the baggage claim desk where a young woman took his name and asked where he was staying so she could return the bag. “Actually I’m staying with the American ambassador” he told her.

Her jaw dropped and she said “You know Rufus Gifford?” Of course he said.

“You know his husband too?” she continued. Yes he nodded.

“And what about his dog Argos?” Yes he assured her but not as well as he knows Rufus or Stephen.

Most ambassadors are not household names in their host country but most ambassadors don’t star in a popular reality show have Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary at their wedding or get stopped for selfies on the street. Rufus Gifford did this and more earning him a special place in hearts of Danes and in the history of American diplomacy.

Gifford 46 is part of a new generation of ambassadors: Young accessible telegenic equally at ease talking foreign policy on news shows and posting dog photos on social media. While not the first openly gay man to hold the title he was the first diplomat to win an award for his Danish reality series (“I Am the Ambassador”) and the first to see himself go global when it streamed on Netflix.

“My ambassadorship was absolutely defined by taking risks” Gifford says. “I was always frustrated by the people who would say to me ‘Oh you just got the sweetest gig in the world. You get to just go around play golf live in your great house and visit with the queen.’” His response? “First of all I don’t play golf. I want to work I want to work my tail off. And sure I’d love to meet the queen but it’s certainly not why I want to be an ambassador.”

Now President Biden has nominated Gifford to be his chief of protocol the State Department envoy who travels with the president on all overseas trips greets every foreign leader who visits the United States and serves as the liaison to all the foreign diplomats serving here. With America’s image abroad badly in need of repair longtime friends say Gifford personifies a return to civility and cooperation.

“I think Rufus sees himself as the first embrace” says Democratic political consultant Stephanie Cutter. “He’s the first impression that world leaders will get from this administration. And it’s a pretty good first impression.”

Gifford's path to global diplomacy was full of unexpected turns. He grew up with three siblings in wealthy Manchester-by-the-Sea Mass. a suburb north of Boston. He went to boarding school and then Brown University. His mother and his father a retired banker who once served as Bank of America's chairman have been married for more than 50 years.

When he was 18 he came out. His parents Gifford says defined happiness one way: marriage kids a house in the suburbs. So after he graduated from college he moved to Los Angeles to find his own path. “The process of coming out when you come from a traditional family even if it’s not a religious family is something that you need to navigate for yourself” he says.

He considers his 20s “a series of failures.” He worked as a producer on a few movies in Hollywood which sounds glamorous but wasn’t. Then he applied to business school and didn’t get in. He was desperate for a change when a few months before his 30th birthday John F. Kerry became the Democratic nominee for president.

Gifford called Kerry’s daughter a classmate from Brown and asked whether he could volunteer for the campaign. They put him to work fundraising in California and everything clicked. “It’s the moment I balanced my head and my heart. That’s how I describe it. It’s this moment where oh my God not only am I passionate about the work that I’m doing but I actually feel like I’m good at it too.”

Turns out Gifford was very good at it. Kerry’s loss led Gifford to a California-based political consulting firm where he made a name for himself. In 2007 he was considering a job offer with Hillary Clinton but met Barack Obama and took a chance on the underdog during the 2008 campaign. Cutter says that Gifford “is incredibly personable and able to connect with people in an unique way that you don’t see very often.”

Gifford’s skill at managing wealthy donors led him to Washington as a top finance official for the Democratic National Committee and then Obama’s 2012 campaign. The move also led him to Stephen DeVincent a veterinarian on a science fellowship at the State Department. DeVincent a.k.a. “polar bear guy” was working with Arctic nations to help negotiate polar bear treaties and “making sure that his love of animals translated into policy” Gifford says.

The two quickly became a couple. “I look at the stars. He grounds us” Gifford says. “He is in every way the yin to my yang.”

Most ambassadors are either career Foreign Service officers or political appointees who give millions to the winning candidate. Gifford was one of a handful of Obama’s campaign staffers offered a posting and made an immediate splash.

“He really made an effort to convince the Danes that we as a small nation were able to punch above our weight” says Peter Christensen a Danish journalist. Gifford was well-versed on policy issues but charmed Denmark with his light touch. “That’s something that Danes like: People who like to laugh at themselves.”

It wasn’t long before Erik Struve Hansen an executive producer for Danish Broadcasting Corporation approached Gifford with an idea: Would he consider doing a documentary series for young adults? The network had prior successes following a Danish pop star and other celebrities; what about an ambassador?

“It’s an important job and it’s taken very seriously by Danish society and by Danish politicians” Struve Hansen says. “But for a younger audience I thought it was quite unknown exactly what that job was about.”

Gifford he says seemed quite different from what he normally thought of diplomats: Only 39 years old Gifford was more outgoing and more down to earth than most ambassadors in Europe. He was proudly openly gay. The idea of discovering Denmark through Gifford’s eyes was a compelling narrative. “And of course I also think he’s good-looking which is not a disadvantage for a TV show.”

Ambassadors are encouraged to do local media and Gifford found the idea of reaching younger Danes intriguing. There is an entire generation of Europeans who loved Americans and American culture but were skeptical about American foreign policy.

Diplomacy he says is “handshakes and eye contact and trust. And so the idea behind the show was can we through sharing my life in my work build trust.” The diplomatic relationship between the United States and Denmark which goes back to the early 1800s was already strong. But he wondered “Can we modernize it? Can we make people interested in the work that we’re doing and make them actually trust us a bit?”

They expected a tiny audience but the two-season 10-episode series made Gifford into a national celebrity. It blended the professional — meetings conferences official duties — with the personal. Danes watched the new ambassador learning to speak Danish exploring the country and hosting parties at the American residence with political figures and a lot of Danish celebrities which made for good television.

“I think we counted more than 28000 people who had at some point been through the residence” Christensen says. “That really says a lot about Rufus Gifford.”

There were also intimate moments. Down time with DeVincent and their golden retriever. Visits with his family. Frank discussions about his sexuality. The series ended with the couple’s wedding in 2015 a glamorous (privately funded) party complete with paparazzi and fireworks.

It was the same year the Supreme Court legalized marriage equality in the United States. Denmark had been the first country in the world to legally recognize civil partnerships for same-sex couples in 1989; Gifford and DeVincent wanted to honor that history by holding their wedding in Copenhagen City Hall.

“It became part of a story that we wanted to tell” he says. “A little country like Denmark could actually impact the world.”

The day Donald Trump was inaugurated the two moved to Massachusetts where they've been living with dogs Argos and Svend. Gifford decided to take another risk: run for an open congressional seat in 2018 hoping to bring some of the things he learned in Europe to American politics. It was his first time as a candidate in a crowded primary and he ended up falling short.

“I’m not really afraid of failure: It hits me hard but I’m not afraid of it” he says. “I do think you have to go in with a sense of fearlessness but it was a tough experience.”

He began fundraising for Biden not long after and on Friday the president officially tapped him to serve as chief of protocol.

In that job he will choreograph all the details of any presidential visit including who shakes hands and in what order who sits where who rides in the motorcade and a thousand other pieces of an international puzzle. Every country has its own cultural history that requires a delicate touch. The job is the epitome of “soft” diplomacy: Not the talking points of foreign policy but what comes before and after.

Gifford will also need to repair damage done inside the Office of Chief of Protocol: A department watchdog reported that Sean Lawler one of Trump’s appointees for the job routinely made intimidating abusive homophobic and other inappropriate comments to subordinates allegations that Lawler denied.

Traditionally nominees do not comment on the job prior to confirmation and Gifford is no exception. But according to his many admirers he’s the right man at the right time.

“He’s had a set of diverse experiences and the thing that links them together is that it’s always been about building relationships” Cutter says. “And at this time when we are repairing relationships all over the globe and reestablishing the United States as a force for good Rufus is a perfect pick.”

Well maybe not perfect. Soren Pind Denmark’s justice minister when Gifford was in Copenhagen calls him “the quintessential American: Optimistic and can do.” He adds “There is no doubt in my mind that Mr. Gifford made a real difference in the defense of the West.”

There’s one disappointment says Pind: “I am only sad that he couldn’t help me secure a statue of Ronald Reagan in the Danish capitol. But even the best men have limits.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vaW50ZXJhY3RpdmUvMjAyMS8wNS91cy93aGl0ZXdhc2hpbmctb2YtYW1lcmljYS1yYWNpc20v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Racial violence in America: 60 years of whitewashing,"Chinese laborers had been coming to the United States since the mid-1800s with many fleeing the destruction caused by the Taiping Rebellion which began in 1850. In the 1860s the Chinese population in the US nearly doubled as many came to do the dangerous work of building the Pacific Coast Railroad according to researchers for the PBS series “American Experience: The Chinese Exclusion Act.”

Historian William Wei told CNN that Chinese laborers were paid lower wages than White Americans and European immigrants who saw the Chinese as an economic threat.

“Once upon a time in the West there were over 200 Chinese communities until the Chinese who lived in them were driven out” said Wei a University of Colorado Boulder professor and author of “Asians in Colorado: A History of Persecution and Perseverance in the Centennial State.”

Wei and other Coloradans have dedicated themselves to retelling the history of Denver’s Chinatown. On October 30 1880 political organizers held an anti-Chinese parade ahead of the presidential election. The next day a bar fight morphed into a mob that lynched a Chinese man beat every Chinese person they happened upon then tore down the neighborhood that had been a respite for Chinese miners in the region.

Our study of similar incidents reveals the anti-Chinese fervor spread like wildfire through the West moving from California to Washington to Wyoming. Anywhere Chinese people were trying to make a living White and recent European immigrants often united through unions threatened and executed them burned their encampments and at times even packed them up on rail cars destined for ships heading back to Asia. Wei pointed out the irony when Congress used the violence as an excuse to pass the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 claiming that barring more Chinese laborers from entry would keep the peace.

The Chinese built much of the infrastructure that made expansion into the West possible enriching the pockets of Gilded Age tycoons and enabling generations of Americans to make the Western half of the US their home but the Chinese never benefited. They eventually disappeared from communities like Denver said Wei.

“In our particular economic system we tend to use up people a lot right?” asked Wei referring to immigrants and people of color. “And once we use them we dispose of them or we deport them as has been the case recently.”

Monica Muñoz Martinez is one of several historians working to bring more attention to the long history of persecution against Mexican people who along with Native Americans suffered as White American interests expanded West into territories they’d already been living in.

The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the Mexican-American War also granted citizenship to Mexican residents living on newly-acquired land. The treaty was also supposed to protect their property rights.

Mexicans had long prospered as ranch owners in California New Mexico and Texas but then saw their lands slowly siphoned off into White hands by fraud taxation squatting and sometimes outright robbery Martinez explained.

“When Anglos are stealing land from Mexicans it was perfectly legal or sanctioned by Texas law” said Martinez an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “But then when Mexicans tried to take land back — they were bandits that were heavily policed and murdered by groups like the Texas Rangers.”

The Texas Rangers immortalized later as heroes of the Wild West were a state-sanctioned force responsible for the murder and banishment of hundreds of Mexican and Mexican American people. The violence peaked in 1915 in a time called La Matanza or the massacre. Murders often took place in quiet rural areas often with the excuse that the people the Rangers killed were threatening White communities.

In Presidio County in January 1918 Texas Rangers went into a Mexican community and took the owner of a ranch along with 14 other men and boys. They later executed them with no trial suggesting the men had been involved in a raid. That summer in response to public pressure over what was called the “Porvenir Massacre” the state disbanded the Texas Ranger company responsible for the murders according to congressional testimony from Martinez.

The families of the victims often fled their communities abandoning their property in the face of the onslaught of government-sanctioned violence. Martinez noted that it took only one generation for tens of millions of acres of Mexican-owned land to shift to White hands.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMzAvYnVzaW5lc3MvZWNvbm9teS9wYW5kZW1pYy1qb2JzLXRlZW5hZ2Vycy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Luckiest Workers in America? Teenagers.,"Roller-coaster operators and lemonade slingers at Kennywood amusement park a Pittsburgh summer staple won’t have to buy their own uniforms this year. Those with a high school diploma will also earn $13 as a starting wage — up from $9 last year — and new hires are receiving free season passes for themselves and their families.

The big pop in pay and perks for Kennywood’s seasonal work force where nearly half of employees are under 18 echoes what is happening around the country as employers scramble to hire waiters receptionists and other service workers to satisfy surging demand as the economy reopens.

For American teenagers looking for work this may be the best summer in years.

As companies try to go from hardly staffed to fully staffed practically overnight teens appear to be winning out more than any demographic group. The share of 16- to 19-year-olds who are working hasn’t been this high since 2008 before the unfolding global financial crisis sent employment plummeting. Roughly 256000 teens in that age group gained employment in April — counting for the vast majority of newly employed people — a significant change after teenagers suffered sharp job losses at the beginning of the pandemic. Whether the trend can hold up will become clearer when jobs data for May is released on Friday.

It could come with a downside. Some educators warn that jobs could distract from school. And while employment can itself offer learning opportunities the most recent wave of hiring has been led by white teens raising concerns that young people from minority groups might miss out on a hot summer labor market.",,,,,,

But Wall Street wants it to be even bigger. POLITICO's Kellie Mejdrich reports on an effort to open up access to Bitcoin investment.

In addition to pending fund proposals backed by Fidelity and Scaramucci’s SkyBridge One River Digital Asset Management is being advised by former SEC Chair Jay Clayton as it pitches a “carbon neutral” Bitcoin ETF. Clayton led the agency in the Trump era and didn’t sign off on any of the cryptocurrency fund proposals during his tenure. While in office Clayton highlighted concerns that cryptocurrency markets were ripe forfraud and manipulation and said that regulators had a host of issues to resolve before permitting ETFs.

The SEC which is responsible for allowing the funds to launch appears to be in no hurry to expand access to Bitcoin investments. The agency’s new chair Gary Gensler has emerged in recent weeks as a clear crypto skeptic. That surprised some advocates who were hoping he’d be more amenable to Bitcoin after teaching and researching digital finance at MIT.

Gensler has flagged fundamental concerns about the operations of the underlying cryptocurrency market that the ETFs want to track. He says exchanges that facilitate the buying and selling of digital currency aren’t adequately regulated and that market data is lacking.

“Altogether this has led to substantially less investor protection than in our traditional securities markets and to correspondingly greater opportunities for fraud and manipulation” Gensler said in House testimony Wednesday.

Despite the growing industry enthusiasm Wall Street is also split on the future of cryptocurrency. Some executives are dismissing the push to expand access even as their firms try to satisfy customer demand.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in House testimony Thursday that his company — the nation’s largest bank — was debating how to make it available in a safe way. But Dimon’s personal advice? “Stay away from it.”

“That does not mean the clients don’t want it” Dimon said. “It goes back to how you have to run a business. I don’t smoke marijuana but if you make it nationally legal I’m not going to stop our people from banking it.”

One of Gensler’s colleagues is urging him to act. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce a Republican on the agency’s five-member board said Gensler’s recent warnings “conveyed the overly conservative approach that has typified the SEC in the crypto arena.” She said the agency should move forward with approval of crypto funds on their merits.

Six applications are pending with the SEC to list cryptocurrency ETFs on stock exchanges run by the New York Stock Exchange and Cboe Global Markets. Wall Street titans are lining up to provide services for the funds including Morgan Stanley Bank of New York Mellon and State Street.

“Given the growth of the market and increased interest the stakes are high as people compete to be the first approved” Peirce said.

By not bringing digital currency into the regulatory mainstream Peirce and industry players say the SEC is allowing crypto activity to remain outside the purview of government watchdogs.

“What that does is it allows the wild Wild West to continue” said Tom Quaadman executive vice president of the U.S Chamber of Commerce Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness.

Jan van Eck the CEO of the $71 billion asset manager VanEck said those who oppose Bitcoin ETFs — like the one his firm is proposing — “are effectively forcing investors into inferior fund structures and less regulated venues.”

Critics of moving forward with the funds say the SEC needs to first address underlying risks in the cryptocurrency market.

“The regulatory concerns about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency markets go far beyond ETF issues” said Joseph Cisewski senior derivatives consultant and special counsel to the Wall Street reform group Better Markets. “The crypto exchanges operate almost entirely in the dark and we’ve repeatedly seen how risks increase and evolve when they are allowed to develop in the cracks of our regulatory system.”.

On Capitol Hill lawmakers from both sides of the aisle — including staunch Bitcoin advocates — are unconvinced or on the fence indicating that the SEC will face political pressure to continue to slow-walk the issue.

The companies “need to show their contribution to our economy and in that sense they really haven’t done well” Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said in an interview.

“I would caution the commission against prioritizing the review of cryptocurrency ETFs over fulfilling the legal directives of Congress” said Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) who leads SEC oversight in the House and wants the agency to finish rules languishing from the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.

Republican lawmakers who champion free markets and digital currency said in interviews that they too are taking time to study the issue before backing the efforts.

“I’m not clear yet on exactly what we should do” said Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) who in May launched the bipartisan Senate Financial Innovation Caucus to encourage policy development in crypto and other financial technologies.

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) who with Lummis serves on the Senate Banking Committee said he’s concerned about the accuracy of the underlying reference prices for the funds because crypto trading occurs on venues that aren’t regulated by the SEC.

Tillis said the fund applications “have to be scrutinized mainly from a consumer protection perspective.”

“We need to figure out how we deal with this” said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) a member of the Banking Committee. “Otherwise you’re going to have a lot of people lose a lot of money.”",,,,,,,,,

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWN1dC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9qZXNzaWNhLWJpZWwtMjAtcG91bmRzLWVwc29tLXNhbHQtbWV0LWdhbGEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jessica Biel Soaked in 20 Lbs of Epsom Salt Before Met Gala,"Photo: ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images

There are lots of things that go into Met Gala prep. Kim Kardashian had to learn the art of breathing in a corset for example. If you’re Jessica Biel the night before the Met Gala was all about dumping more Epsom salt than anyone has ever needed into a bathtub. How much Epsom salt do you think that would be? A pound maybe? Two? Think bigger.

In a TikTok Biel shared that she would be spending the night before the Met Gala soaking in a bath filled with 20 pounds of Epsom salt. That’s five full bags of magnesium sulfate. Dr. Teal’s the brand used by Biel in the video recommends customers use “at least” two cups per bath to relax muscles and reduce inflammation. So technically she is following the instructions.

For scale the average 1-year-old weighs about 20 pounds. Why would anyone need a baby-size amount of Epsom salts in their bath? Biel did not explain her reasoning but kindly shared her routine. The actress said your bath should have “water as hot as you can take it.” Then she instructed you soak for 30 minutes then “drink tons of water” and “off to bed early.” Anyone who has ever taken an Epsom-salt bath knows that there’s no way you wouldn’t be off to bed early after soaking in that high of a concentration.

If you think that maybe 20 pounds of Epsom salt might fix everything for you think again. First of all that’s like a $25 bath. Second of all medical professionals don’t think it’s a good idea. Dr. T.N. Rekha Singh told Yahoo Life that Biel’s method could have negative side effects. “Overuse or excessively concentrated solutions can lead to dehydration salt imbalance or magnesium overdose” she told the website.

Long story short you don’t need more than two cups of Epsom salt to get the maximum amount of relaxation. Your muscles will still thank you and — I’m just guessing on this one — so will your pipes. (That much salt can’t be good for them right?)

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

The past month and a half has been bumpy for Bitcoin.

After a bully first quarter of 2021 that led to an all-time peak of $63000 per unit in mid-April the world's leading digital currency has since lost more than 40% of its value settling at just over $35000 on Friday May 28.

Holdout investors who only a couple of months ago may have thought they’d missed an opportunity of a lifetime are now sighing with relief; meanwhile those who bought in at the peak are trying not to think about their losses.

And what about Warren Buffett? What would world's most famous investor say to those who might be thinking of firing up their investment apps and buying Bitcoin at a bargain price.

It’s “probably rat poison squared” Buffett once said.

'Contrary to the interests of civilization'

While Buffett chose not to comment on cryptocurrency during his company Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholders meeting earlier this month Berkshire vice-chairman Charlie Munger pulled no punches on the subject.

""I don’t welcome a currency that’s so useful to kidnappers and extortionists"" Munger said during the meeting's much-watched Q&A session. ""The whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization.""

Not to be outdone Buffett has made his share of extremely cutting remarks about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency over the years: “I don't have any Bitcoin. I don't own any cryptocurrency I never will” he told CNBC in 2020.

Here are three reasons Buffett won’t go near it.

1. It has ‘no unique value at all’

Larry W Smith/EPA/Shutterstock

The billionaire investor doesn’t like Bitcoin because he considers it an unproductive asset.

Buffett has a well-known preference for stocks of corporations whose value — and cash flow — come from producing things. But cryptocurrencies don’t have real value Buffett said in a CNBC interview in 2020.

“They don't reproduce they can't mail you a check they can't do anything and what you hope is that somebody else comes along and pays you more money for them later on but then that person's got the problem.”

Though Bitcoin is intended to provide real value as a payment system that use is still pretty limited. As Buffett sees it Bitcoin’s value comes from the optimism that someone else will be willing to pay more for it in the future than you’re paying today.

2. He doesn’t think crypto counts as money

As a tradeable asset Bitcoin boomed. But does it meet the three criteria of money? According to the most common definition money is supposed to be a means of exchange a store of value and a unit of account.

Story continues

But Buffett calls it a “mirage.”

“It does not meet the test of a currency” the billionaire said on CNBC in 2014. “It is not a durable means of exchange it's not a store of value.”

He adds that it’s a very effective way of anonymously transmitting money. But: “a check is a way of transmitting money too” he said. “Are checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money?”

3. He doesn’t understand it

Larry W Smith/EPA/Shutterstock

Buffett became one of the most successful investors in history by sticking with stocks he understands.

""I get in enough trouble with things I think I know something about. Why in the world should I take a long or short position in something I don't know anything about?”

But people like to gamble he told CNBC after a 2018 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting which is another problem with nonproductive assets.

“If you don’t understand it you get much more excited than if you understand it. You can have anything you want to imagine if you just look at something and say ‘that’s magic.’”

How does Buffett pick winning stocks?

Laurent Gillieron/EPA/Shutterstock

The billionaire investor follows the value investing strategy — which focuses on buying undervalued stocks of strong companies and holding them for a long time.

Simple right?

Berkshire Hathaway looks for companies with a good profit margin and those that produce unique products that can’t easily be substituted. As Warren Buffett once said in a letter to his shareholders “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.”

But Buffett’s distaste for crypto stocks doesn’t mean you shouldn’t buy Bitcoin. Even the billionaire has come around on sectors he previously spoke out against.

He notoriously avoided tech stocks even at the height of the dot-com bubble and now his company’s largest holding is Apple.

Bitcoin has made a lot of people rich along the way. But that doesn’t mean you’ve missed the boat on investing — just listen to Buffett’s words of wisdom.

The most reliable way to make money in the market is through a balanced diversified portfolio of stocks bonds and ETFs.

In some ways investing is like participating in a race. You don't necessarily need to be the fastest right out of the gate to win. Rather you just need to keep a steady pace over the long haul to come out ahead.

The S&P 500 is one of the best long-term investments out there and famed investor Warren Buffet has long touted the S&P 500 as an ideal option.

In fact during the 2020 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder's meeting Buffett claimed that ""for most people the best thing to do is to own the S&P 500 index fund."" Here's why the S&P 500 is so powerful and how it could help you make a lot of money in the stock market.

A more resilient investment

The S&P 500 is comprised of 500 of the largest and most stable companies in the United States. When you invest in an S&P 500 index fund you're investing in all the stocks that make up the S&P 500 in order to mirror the index's performance.

Because the S&P 500 contains some of the strongest companies in the country it's more likely to see positive long-term growth. In addition it's more resilient in the face of market crashes.

This isn't to say that the S&P 500 is immune to market downturns. However it's more likely to recover from crashes than some other types of investments.

Since the S&P 500's inception in 1957 it has faced countless corrections downturns and crashes. Given enough time however it's been able to recover from every single one. And since its inception it has earned an average rate of return of around 10% per year.

^SPX data by YCharts

This doesn't necessarily mean the S&P 500 will continue earning 10% returns year after year. There will be years when you experience losses while other years you'll earn much higher-than-average returns. Over time those good years and bad years should average out to around 10% per year.

The market will inevitably crash sooner or later. But by investing in S&P 500 index funds there's a very good chance your investments will recover.

How much can you earn with the S&P 500?

Although S&P 500 index funds are relatively safe investments you can still potentially make a lot of money.

The key to getting rich with the S&P 500 is to give your money as much time as possible to grow. Ideally you'll have started saving early in life and can continue investing consistently for several decades. But if you're off to a late start it's still important to start investing now instead of putting it off.

Let's say you're investing $300 per month in S&P 500 index funds and you're earning a 10% average annual rate of return. Here's approximately how much you'd accumulate over time depending on how many years you have left to save:

Number of Years to Save Total Savings 5 $22000 10 $57000 20 $206000 30 $592000 40 $1593000

Given enough time it's possible to become a millionaire by investing in S&P 500 index funds. But even if you don't have 40 years left to save you can still make a substantial amount of money.

Also one of the best features of this type of investment is that it's hands-off. In other words your S&P 500 index funds will perform best when you don't touch them for as long as possible. So all you need to do is invest consistently and then sit back and let your investments do the rest of the work for you.

Warren Buffett is a proponent of S&P 500 index funds and it's easy to see why. There are several advantages to choosing this type of investment and by investing consistently you can potentially earn more than you think.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vamFzb24tYXRlbi93aXRoLWp1c3QtNC13b3Jkcy13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0LWV4cGxhaW5lZC1tb3N0LWltcG9ydGFudC10cmFpdC1vZi1iZXN0LW1hbmFnZXJzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With Just 4 Words Warren Buffett Explained the Most Important Trait of the Best Managers,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/with-just-4-words-warren-buffet-explained-most-important-trait-of-best-managers.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vamFzb24tYXRlbi93aXRoLWp1c3QtNC13b3Jkcy13YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0LWV4cGxhaW5lZC1tb3N0LWltcG9ydGFudC10cmFpdC1vZi1iZXN0LW1hbmFnZXJzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2hvbWVzL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLW1pbGxpb25zL2dlbmUtc2ltbW9ucy1vZi1raXNzLWJ1eXMtaGVuZGVyc29uLWhvbWUtbG90LWZvci0xMC04bS0yMzY2NzQ3L9IBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2hvbWVzL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLW1pbGxpb25zL2dlbmUtc2ltbW9ucy1vZi1raXNzLWJ1eXMtaGVuZGVyc29uLWhvbWUtbG90LWZvci0xMC04bS0yMzY2NzQ3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gene Simmons of Kiss buys Henderson home lot for $10.8M,"Rock star Gene Simmons of KISS has paid a combined $10.8 million for a home in the Henderson hillside community of Ascaya and a lot adjacent to it Simmons’ Realtor confirmed to Real Estate Millions.

Rock star Gene Simmons of Kiss has paid a combined $10.8 million for a home in the Henderson hillside community of Ascaya and a lot adjacent to it Simmons’ Realtor confirmed to Real Estate Millions.

The two-story 10871-square-foot six-bedroom home with a basement went for $8.2 million after being listed for $8.49 million according to the Multiple Listing Service. TMZ reported today the Kiss rocker bought a home in Henderson.

Clark County records show the buyer as Goodman Realty LLC with an address in New Jersey but Las Vegas Realtors confirmed Simmons who’s been looking at properties in The Ridges in Summerlin and MacDonald Highlands in Henderson was the buyer. Realtors also said Simmons bought the lot adjacent to the home to provide additional privacy. County records confirmed Goodman Realty as the buyer at $2.6 million for the .48-acre parcel. In May 2020 Omar and Susan Cabahug paid $700000 for the vacant lot.

Michael T. Austin Trust was listed as the seller of the home county records show.

Simmons’ agent Mitch McClellan president and broker with Southern Highlands Realty confirmed those details. He said Simmons however does not want to comment at this time.

The MLS shows the listing agent was Ivan Sher of Berkshire Hathaway HomeService Nevada. He declined to comment.

The MLS described the property as ”a distinctively modern estate in Ascaya offers a unique opportunity to live in a piece of art that has no equal in the Las Vegas Valley.”

The MLS said the home has more than 11000 square feet of living space and the “residence blends indoor and outdoor appeal into a seamless whole that is not only exciting but masterfully executed. Enter the home via an illusioned floating pathway over a sculptural koi pond. Highlighted by glass walls and soaring geometrical spaces the transitions between indoor and outdoor space are blurred by disappearing glass walls throughout.”

The MLS went on to say “the outdoor full-valley views are captivating but the interior scene is equally impressive. Natural stone is blended with polished granite and unfinished concrete creating a sensory experience with an artistic sensual backdrop for colorful furnishings and art. With six bedrooms six full baths and two half baths the home can easily accommodate a large family or serve as a private retreat with abundant spaces for guests.”

County records show the property has a pool 3963 square feet on the first floor 3882 on the second floor a finished basement of 3026 square feet and basement garage of 2284 square feet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5qLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDUvaGVyZS1hcmUtNS1tdWx0aS1taWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1ob21lcy1mb3Itc2FsZS1hdC10aGUtamVyc2V5LXNob3JlLmh0bWzSAXZodHRwczovL3d3dy5uai5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA1L2hlcmUtYXJlLTUtbXVsdGktbWlsbGlvbi1kb2xsYXItaG9tZXMtZm9yLXNhbGUtYXQtdGhlLWplcnNleS1zaG9yZS5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here are 5 multi-million dollar homes for sale at the Jersey Shore,"Four boat slips.

What is Amazon Prime Day?

Founder Jeff Bezos and company pitched the first Prime Day as a celebration of Amazon's 20th anniversary

Amazon Prime Day is an annual shopping holiday designed to rival events like BF and Cyber Monday. The sale lasts two days typically in mid-July.

Amazon staggers many shorter deals throughout the two-day event. It includes many limited-time discounts that may only last several hours. High-demand items frequently sell out before the deal expires.

Amazon announces some deals in advance — often including Amazon-made devices like Kindle and Echo. However ""Flash Deals"" often remain a mystery until they go live on the website.

The surprise factor encourages customers to check back continually leading to unplanned purchases. The continual discovery of new offers can also bring about non-stop media coverage essentially providing Amazon with free advertising throughout the entire two-day event.

FAQ

Here's a rundown of frequently asked questions about the annual shopping holiday:

Amazon Prime Day 2024 starts in July 2024 although exact dates have yet to be announced.

Per the company's blog post:

Prime Day will take place in the following countries: Australia Austria Belgium Brazil Canada Egypt France Germany India Italy Japan Luxembourg Mexico Netherlands Poland Portugal Saudi Arabia Singapore Spain Sweden Turkey the United Arab Emirates the U.S. and the UK.

Prime Day 2022 occurred on July 12 and 13 with a Prime Early Access Sale following on October 11 and 12 that provided shoppers with early access to holiday deals. Prime Day 2023 ran July 11-12 2023 and a second Prime Day called Prime Big Deal Days is set for October 11-12.

From 2015 to 2019 Amazon held Prime Day in mid-July. The online seller held the first Prime Day in honor of the website's 20th anniversary that month.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic Amazon pushed back the 2020 event to October.

The mid-July timeframe was reinstated in 2022.

Does Amazon Prime Day include Apple deals?

Yes. The 2022 iteration featured a hefty discount on the Apple Watch Series 7 discounting it by $120 with prices as low as $279. AirPods with Wired Case were also on sale for $89.99 the cheapest price seen in 2022.

In 2021 the sale included numerous Apple products including AirPods deals for $60 off $120 off an Apple Watch Series 6 and up to $200 off M1 MacBooks.

In 2019 Amazon became an official Apple Authorized Reseller. Llistings described as both ""sold by"" and ""ships from"" Amazon.com are guaranteed to be official Apple products.

In recent years Prime Day deals have included Apple accessories

Third-party resellers can sell Apple products on Amazon but they may present some risk of receiving counterfeits open-box items listed as new or other issues.

Viewing seller ratings and reviews can help shoppers discern whether a particular deal is trustworthy.

When was it held in the past?

Amazon's official Prime Day events have fallen on the following dates:

2015 - July 15

2016 - July 12

2017 - July 11 and 12

2018 - July 16 and 17

2019 - July 15 and 16

2020 - October 13 and 14

2021 - June 21 and 22

2022 - July 12 and 13

2023 - July 11 and 12

Amazon postponed the 2020 event due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company returned to running the sale in the normal July spot for 2022.

Does Amazon Prime Day have good deals?

Amazon's sales often provide steep discounts from standard retail pricing.

In 2015 the event's first year customers complained that most sale items were far from popular. Social media users criticized the event for serving as little more than an ""Amazon garage sale.""

Today Amazon's shopping event has much better deals than in its divisive first year

However the company began offering more appealing sale items in subsequent years. In 2016 Amazon said customers placed 60% more orders than in the first year.

Today Prime Day's high-profile deals are much closer to Black Friday sales than they were at the beginning.

Does it require a Prime Membership?

Yes Prime Day deals are only available to Amazon Prime members. An Amazon Prime subscription costs $139 annually or $14.99 per month. The pricing for a Prime Membership has increased in the past year but trials are available and may be utilized during Prime Day to take part in the deals available for purchase.

Is there a Prime student discount?

Yes Amazon has a Prime student discount program. Students can pay $69 per year or $7.49 per month. Currently you may try Amazon Prime Student with a free 6-month trial. Following the trial you'll pay just $7.49 a month. Students are required to submit documentation to verify their eligibility.

How much money do customers save?

Amazon says that customers saved $1.7 billion during the 2022 shopping event.

What are the most popular items?

According to Amazon its Amazon Music promotions offered the best deal ever for Prime members and drove more sign-ups for Amazon Music Unlimited worldwide than any other Prime Day.

The company listed top-selling item types excluding Amazon devices from several other regions:

United States: Waterpik Electric Water Flosser

Germany and Austria: Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Android Tablet

France: Philips OneBlade replacement blades

Singapore: Vita Coco Natural Coconut Water

Australia: DualSense Wireless Controller for the PlayStation 5

United Arab Emirates: Fairy Lemon Dishwashing Liquid Soap

Amazon says the Fire TV Stick 4K with Alexa Voice Remote was the most popular global purchase. The company also mentioned that customers purchased a record-setting number of Fire TVs from brands including Toshiba and Insignia.

How much money do third-party sellers make?

According to an Amazon press release with 2023 stats:

The first day of Prime Day July 11 was the single largest sales day in company history.

Does the event include anything other than deals?"

Additionally we investigated the impact of weather on the frequency of tick bites and tick-borne infections. We found no significant difference between anti-B. burgdorferi antibody seroprevalence and seroconversion and a correlation between reported tick bite and anti-B. burgdorferi IgG but not IgM. Rickettsiosis was very rare. There was only very limited evidence of symptomatic tick-borne infection in the investigated population but frequent unspecific symptoms. There was no difference in reported tick bites or tick-borne infections between the investigated seasons despite highly variable weather.

The prevalence of anti-B. burgdorferi IgG was not significantly higher than the incidence shown by the seroconversion rate. This indicates that anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies do not remain in the blood to a level above the cut-off of serological analysis for several years unless reactivated by a new infection. If antibodies persisted for 2 or more years the prevalence would be at least double the incidence. This finding accounts for serological analysis and cannot be transferred to the intrathecal antibody test as this is relying on the index of antibody amount between serum and cerebrospinal fluid. This may be positive when the serological analysis is negative [40] and it has been proposed to remain positive for years [41]. The IgG seroprevalence in our study is in concordance with previous blood donor data from the Region of Southern Denmark [42]. Eleven IgM-positive participants were continuously positive in the follow-up without significant titer change or development of IgG antibodies and the factor analysis found no correlation between tick bites and the presence of anti-B. burgdorferi IgM antibodies in serum. This could indicate that cautions should be taken regarding clinical interpretation of serum IgM antibodies as previously suggested [35] especially without relevant symptoms or a follow-up blood sample.

There was only one participant positive for anti-Rickettsia spp. antibodies and she was asymptomatic which indicates that autochthonous rickettsiosis is currently of least concern to the public health in the region. In Denmark B. burgdorferi and R. helvetica are common indicating that the transmission of or infectious/pathogenic potential for B. burgdorferi is higher than for R. helvetica as one study that included Southern Jutland reported nearly equal prevalence of the two bacteria in sampled ticks [13]. The result is in concordance with a study showing that most recorded cases of rickettsiosis in Denmark are due to imported African tick bite fever usually caused by R. africae [30]. The investigated region of Southern Jutland is particularly interesting regarding tick-borne infections since this is the primary region exposed to migrating land-based animals from the European mainland bringing new tick species and pathogens with them [43]. As R. helvetica is the only rickettsial species being reported in nearly all studies on Danish ticks [9101112 141516] with single findings of Rickettsia massiliae [13] and Rickettsia raoultii [43] being the exceptions R. helvetica is the likely cause of the seroconversion. However due to antibody cross-reactivity between rickettsial species it is not absolutely certain. There was no serological evidence of R. felis being present in the studied area of Denmark though its presence has been reported in neighboring Germany [444546] and Sweden [47 48].

We found no significant difference between reported symptoms except for wound after an insect bite or of unknown causes in groups exposed to tick bites or with seroconversion indicating that in some instances symptoms which may be related to tick-borne infections are common in the general population e.g. headache myalgia and arthralgia and hence unspecific. It also indicates that symptoms more related to infection like fever and EM are rare even after exposure to ticks or the tick-borne pathogens present in our region of Denmark. These findings correlate with results from Holland Switzerland and Sweden [26 37 49]. However the design does impose a risk of recall bias and under-reporting as mild symptoms may not be remembered or noted (e.g. low fever) and the bitten person does not necessarily acknowledge a tick bite shown by the number of neuroborreliosis patients reporting tick bites [18 19].

Three participants were both anti-B. burgdorferi IgM- and IgG-positive at the primary blood sample which indicates recent exposure with only one of these reporting a tick bite and another reporting having experienced 3 days of self-limiting fever and no other symptoms within the last 3 months. The participant with short-term fever could be the only participant with potential symptomatic tick-borne infection. Unfortunately no follow-up blood samples were obtained from these individuals.

The simplified questionnaire without registration of amount of time spent outdoors and exact location explains the deviance from the fact that people who spend a lot of time in tick-infested areas are expectedly at an increased risk of being bitten even though spending time outdoors in general did not seem to be a risk factor. Furred animals could potentially pose a risk of tick bites in some settings as they could act as hosts for ticks and carry these to the proximity of humans. However the animals need to be exposed to ticks to do this. Unfortunately the study design made it impossible to distinguish between animals exposed to ticks and not though animals noted as strictly indoor pets were excluded from analysis along with lizards. Many unrecorded factors can influence human exposure to ticks but owning a furred animal does not seem to be an isolated risk factor. A Scandinavian study on risk factors neither found an association between pet ownership and reported tick bites but between outdoor activities and reported tick bites [50].

The summer of 2018 was among the most arid in recent Danish history. It was preceded by a winter and spring with snow until April. In contrast the summers of 2017 and 2019 had considerably more rainfall and higher air humidity [51]. These weather conditions would be expected to increase the number of tick bites and hence tick-borne infections in 2019. However there were no significant differences between the two seasons in either tick bites or seroconversion among the participants. In addition there were no differences in the number of reported tick bites in each group from 2018 to 2019. Within-season weather fluctuations have previously been suggested as a factor influencing the amount of tick-human interaction [52] though in our study the overall difference between full seasons was investigated. The lack of difference coincides with data suggesting relatively stable seasonal distribution of reported neuroborreliosis cases over more extended periods [53] with the primary influence being access to roe deer the main feeding and mating host [54].

It is important to note that the results are not an indicator of tick activity in nature. They are an indicator of the interface between humans and ticks. This is influenced by differences in human behavior under different weather conditions including time spent in nature and perhaps more importantly the behavior when time is spent in nature. The observations are based on a geographical setting where I. ricinus is the only evidently established tick species of human concern. This must be kept in mind if the weather impact results are applied to settings with presence of other tick species.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlnbi5jb20vd2lraXMvYmlvbXV0YW50L0Jlc3RfU2tpbGxz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Skills - BioMutant Guide,"Biogenetics

This section includes the best Biogenetics abilities that can be unlocked. Biogenetics require Bio Points to purchase which can be found by defeating certain enemies or opening Bioblob containers.

Rad Wisps

Cost: 6 Bio Points

Rad Wisps is a great ability to target early in the game as it unleashes small radioactive particles that seek out your enemies automatically. Not only is this great for crowd control but once you activate this ability you'll continue unleashing your little radioactive friends as long as you have Ki energy. The best part is you don't have to face enemies as with most abilities and skills as the homing nature will automatically target the closest enemy for you. Now that's rad.

Mucus Puddle

Cost: 10 Bio Points

Mucus Puddle is a great way to get yourself out of (and literally into) a sticky situation. When you activate this ability you'll pop a bubble around you that collects small enemies as you roll over them. In practice it has a lot in common with Katamari Damacy. It buys you a few seconds to pause in the middle of a battle and reassess. Plus you can heal with complete safety while inside the bubble. Once you pop it the bubble explodes sending whichever enemies you've collected flying all over the place.

Most visits to the memory center where I care for individuals living with Alzheimer’s disease end in disappointment.

“Are there any new treatments Dr. Karlawish?” patients or family members hopefully ask.

I shake my head and say “No.”

I’ve been saying that for the past 18 years.

The few drug treatments I do prescribe are only modestly effective in easing the disease’s cognitive problems. None of them slow its relentless chipping away at individuals’ ability to control their lives or their caregivers’ steady accumulation of commitments of time and task.

So you might think that I’m among those hoping the FDA will approve aducanumab an experimental Alzheimer’s drug developed by Biogen a decision the agency is supposed to make by June 7.

But I’m not. And if it gets the green light I can’t see myself recommending it to my patients. Colleagues of mine in the Alzheimer’s sphere are also reluctant about approving aducanumab. Why? Biogen hasn’t made a convincing case for it.

The consequences of FDA approval are as disturbing as they are vast. Around 2 million Americans could be prescribed aducanumab at an estimated cost that ranges from $20000 to $50000 per person per year. Biogen claims the benefits of slowing declines in cognition and day-to-day function are worth this price. I think the company is wrong and I agree with the analyses by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review; the data to make this case are murky and even if they were clear the drug’s benefits are ambiguous at best and not worth this cost. Putting it on the market will stress Medicare’s resources.

These marginal benefits mean that if aducanumab is approved patients and families will struggle over whether it’s right for them. One of its risks is small bleeds in the brain a risk that is heightened in those with the APOE4 gene a gene associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Families will be drawn into these risk-benefit discussions because treating a parent’s Alzheimer’s with aducanumab may well mean their children will learn their genetic risk of developing the disease. I have little doubt that these at-risk individuals will push the margins of when to begin prescribing aducanumab.

Aducanumab is not the drug to launch a new era of Alzheimer’s treatment. It hasn’t been properly studied and so the FDA has incomplete data to form a judgment. The cause of this is a series of decisions that were good for business but bad for science and patient care.

Aducanumab started with a bang. On September 1 2016 the cover of Nature the prestigious “international journal of science” ran an all-caps headline: “TARGETING AMYLOID.” Inside were the results of a study that showed aducanumab cleared amyloid a protein thought to cause the destruction of brain cells in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Even more exciting the study suggested — but did not prove — that reducing amyloid might slow declines in memory and other cognitive abilities. An accompanying editorial proclaimed that confirming this result would be a “game changer in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease.”

Following these results Biogen launched two identically designed late-phase clinical trials one called ENGAGE the other EMERGE. Those studies however have created an imbroglio. There are two root causes for it.

One cause is that the FDA allowed Biogen to skip a crucial step in drug development: the Phase 2 trial a “learn and confirm” study to assure that the final phase of testing (Phase 3) will make a convincing case that the drug should be marketed to providers and patients. Phase 2 results are an opportunity to learn how to dose a drug to achieve the right balance of safety and benefit a fact of great importance for aducanumab.

Skipping Phase 2 meant that the two Phase 3 trials weren’t informed by good information about effective doses of the drug. In fact as ENGAGE and EMERGE enrolled participants Biogen learned more about dosing and so had to amend the instructions on the dosage given to those who were APOE4 carriers.

The other cause of confusion is that a planned interim look at the trials’ results only made things worse. This analysis of interim data was done to decide whether the studies were “futile.”

In clinical care futility describes care that no longer has a chance of benefitting a patient. It’s a controversial concept because it relies on the often seriously ill patient their family and their clinicians aligning around a common perception of both the benefit of care and the chances of success.

Futility analyses are also controversial in pharmaceutical research. Companies defend them as part of the business of research. Each day of conducting a clinical trial costs money often lots of it. Time and money spent on a study that won’t succeed is time and money wasted. Cut your losses and move on to the next drug.

I disagree with that approach and am bothered that futility analyses are becoming a more routine part of late-phase Alzheimer’s disease clinical trials. I’m not convinced that they save money because by the time a futility analysis is executed much of the money has already been spent on recruitment and other study procedures.

A negative trial is a disappointment and the Alzheimer’s field has lots of them. But even these trials make discoveries that inform the design of other studies. Stopping early to save some money leaves the field with an incomplete data set and this is precisely what vexes the analyses of aducanumab.

Skipping the learn-and-confirm phase and then performing a futility analysis unleashed a frustrating series of events none of which have benefitted the discovery of better treatments for Alzheimer’s disease. On March 21 2019 Biogen announced that the futility analysis supported shutting down ENGAGE and EMERGE. The price of a share of Biogen stock dropped from $320 to $226.

Aducanumab was finished.

But then it wasn’t.

In the three months between when the data set was locked for the futility analyses and the announcement of their results more data came in from 318 participants who completed the trials. The company took another look at this larger data set.

Seven months after its March reveal Biogen announced it had changed its mind. Aducanumab looked to be effective and the company was going to submit its data to the FDA for approval. The stock price returned to its pre-March 21 value.

And just what was this new good news? New results from EMERGE showed that participants who received the high dose of aducanumab outperformed those getting placebo on a measure that blends assessments of cognition and function. No such differences were seen in ENGAGE.

Biogen’s application for approval divided the FDA. At a November 6 meeting of the advisory committee reviewing the application Dr. Billy Dunn director of the FDA’s Office of Neuroscience spoke in favor of approving aducanumab. Tristan Massie a statistician in Dunn’s office concluded the opposite. The advisory committee sided with the statistician and voted overwhelmingly against approval.

In January Biogen issued a cryptic announcement. In response to an information request from the FDA the company had submitted still more data and analyses — the details aren’t publicly known — and said the FDA was pushing its decision from March to June 7.

The crux of the confusion over aducanumab? The data. They’re incomplete and contradictory.

Advocates of aducanumab have tried to explain away the contradictory findings from EMERGE and ENGAGE — clinical trials that tested the same drug on similar populations — with sophisticated statistical analyses. But these kinds of subgroup and responder analyses should be used to generate hypotheses for further study not to decide if a drug is safe and effective for treating people with Alzheimer’s disease.

None of this had to happen. Skipping a key phase of research and performing a futility analysis weren’t scientific decisions; they were business decisions about the pace of research to discover an effective Alzheimer’s treatment and how much a company will spend to sustain that pace.

Ironically approval of aducanumab will likely slow the pace of discovery. A person who’s willing to take on risks and uncertainties will likely choose the guarantee of taking aducanumab instead of enrolling in a clinical trial.

People with Alzheimer’s and their families are desperate for effective treatments for the disease. Aducanumab might be that treatment but we won’t know until Biogen invests the time and money needed to run well-designed trials and complete them. The day such a trial brings home positive results will be a turning point for my practice.

Visits to my memory center will no longer end with bad news but begin with good news: “There’s now a safe and effective Alzheimer’s treatment for you.”

His debut novel Bad Day in Blackrock published in 2008 had won high acclaim. Add to this his 2009 wins of both the Hennessy Award and the prestigious Rooney Prize life could surely not have been bettered. Yet in truth the young writer was struggling.

“I had a two-book deal and a deadline of 2010” he says on zoom from his home in Dublin. “And I didn’t know how to write my second novel.

“In the way of young men I was both arrogant and insecure. And when I returned to my desk I found that I still had a big stretch of my apprenticeship to run. I’d written a book using limited means – the chapters were short the paragraphs short and it contained things I knew. But if I wanted to go beyond that with richer prose and more emotion and tonality – I did not know how to do it.” Ironically winning the Rooney prize proved disabling.

“Seeing my name at the bottom of a list of wonderful writers was hugely inhibiting” he says. “It was paralysing. Publishing your first book is the shock of your life. Suddenly you’re exposed to scrutiny. The great thing about a dream coming true is that it is deeply unsettles you. Your inner world collides with a reality that is difficult to navigate.”

He had many moments of despair before his newly published novel White City became a reality. But it’s been worth those years of toil. This wonderful novel- full of dark humour anger and deep compassion combines a wry look at the dubious goings on in the financial world with the tale of a young man who deprived of family love finds his life spinning out of control. A kind of state of the nation novel it encapsulates Ireland’s post Celtic world quite brilliantly.

Admitting that there’s an egotistical side to writing a novel Power says he is happy with it.

“It’s the kind of book I wanted to write” he says. “It’s not for me to say if its good or not but I have done the best possible job that I can. I wanted to be able to open any page and see a line a joke or an image that I’m proud of. And I can do that.”

Power had been in the process of completing a PhD in American Literature when he had penned his debut. He hoped with its publication that he would be able to write full time. But Frank McGuiness a mentor advised him to complete the PhD saying that if he needed to get a job someday that qualification would make it a whole lot easier.

He did so. And meanwhile he continued to struggle with the new novel.

“I’d started a few weeks after Bad Day came out” he says. “I wrote a monologue of a young man in a rehab clinic. I got 20 pages done and it was funny. I had a good voice there. But I didn’t know why he was there or what the story was so I left it. And every now and then I would add a line or two.

A couple of years later he was invited to Serbia on a literary junket.

“It was an odd week he says. “Not a great experience. There was mostly terrible food and some eerie landscapes. I remember sitting on the terrace in a hotel in dense mist. Like being in a Dracula Castle run by the politburo.”

He took copious notes and wrote a story based there but he didn’t know how to link it to the young guy in rehab. But the following September inspired by watching bankers and property developers enduring public disgrace he wondered how it felt to be part of their families. He wrote another short story.

“And that’s when I saw how they all cohered together” he says.

During this time Power had avoided a day job thanks to grants from the Arts Council and the money he made from journalism literary essays and criticism. But the time came when he was obliged to take a series of jobs in call centres in order to pay the bills.

White City starts in rehab where the young man Ben is looking back at recent events. Son of a recently disgraced Dublin Banker he had abandoned his PhD and attempts at novel writing and floundering in a sea of drugs procured a dead-end job at a Call centre. When a schoolfriend offers him the chance to make a fortune from just one shady deal in the Balkans he sees it as a way to escape all his problems.

All of which begs the question how much of Power is there in Ben?

“It’s not undeliberate that his name has 3 letters with an e in the middle and my friends call me Kev” he says. “Ben’s sensitivities are mine. He is outraged by the same hypocrisies and the same bullshit that I am. The same bad art. But he does not have the family I had. I had two parents who loved me very much and who wanted me to be a writer.”

Power didn’t come from Ben’s affluent world – a world he also drew on for Bad Day in Black Rock. Brought up in the rural village of Rathcoole Power attended a community school. And he didn’t realise there were rich people in Ireland until he encountered them as a student at University College Dublin.

“I used to get the number 10 bus from town to Belfield. You’d pass these extraordinary big Georgian terraced houses. And then down Morehampton road into Donnybrook there were these beautiful leafy streets with enormous houses. I would think who lives there? What kind of person?

“Then I started to meet them in my classes and various societies at college and I ended up at parties in these houses and I knew these people and gained sets of insights into this small contained world. There was a kind of freemasonry of identities between the schools these people went to” he says.

“A lot of people I met there are still my great friends. I borrow from them so there is as much of them in Ben as there is of me.” Unlike Ben Power’s only addiction was a passion for smoking. He still misses it. But the novel isn’t about addiction per se.

“It’s more about the psychology of denial” says Power. “Ben says at one stage ‘Drugs are a way of not seeing’. That’s true. We take pills drink or cigarettes in order to avoid facing that which we don’t want to face.” Since those call centre days Power has returned to academia teaching creative writing first at St Patrick’s College then Dublin City University and now as Assistant Professor on the Creative Writing programme at Trinity College Dublin.

But with his family writing and journalistic commitments life is busy. And in lockdown having to teach on- line and help care for his two-year-old daughter times have been particularly fraught. Yet he has started work on a new novel and plans to publish a collection of critical essays.

We speak the day after he returned from paternity leave – his son was born just three weeks before. He has no plans to write full-time.

“If I have too much time on my hands I don’t write” he says. “I have a panic instead. I love working in Trinity. I love academics and I love teaching. Years ago I thought of myself as an introverted hermit but I need interaction to thrive. I found this last year really hard not seeing colleagues friends or students.”"

What city ever complained about having too many parks? Are there ever enough green spaces hiking trails fishing spots ice skating ponds or places to walk your dog?

The East Side of Providence seems to be destroying itself through over construction. The very things that make this part of the city so desirable are being sacrificed for a mess of pottage. Handsome older houses are demolished and replaced by shoddy McMansions or stick-framed apartment blocks shoehorned onto small city lots. The ratio of green space to hard surfaces is being tipped in favor of runoff-inhibiting tarmac.

Let us pause and consider some of the green spaces that serve as the lungs of the city as well as act as a safety valve to offset the harshness of urban life. The Blackstone Park Conservation District is one of the great treasures of Providence; it reminds us of why we need to protect such amenities and actively support them. The ""emerald necklace"" of Blackstone Boulevard a constituent part of the park is a buffer against the greedy developers.

The last great estate along the mile-and-a-half Boulevard is up for sale. Is there anyone who believes that the Bridgham-Granoff's 3.6 acres will be bought by a philanthropist who plans to create say an arboretum a research center a retreat for painters or poets or some sort of venture that will maintain the gardens as an oasis? Or if the land is developed will a smart green architect create a brilliant scheme with clustered living that will actually enhance the property and make the city proud?

Farther down Blackstone Boulevard the main house at the center of the Nicholson estate was preserved but supporting structures such as a delightful Arts & Crafts playhouse greenhouses and a carriage house were razed. The first house built on the carved-up property is a million-dollar-plus bit of suburban blandness. One vainly hopes that the remaining lots carved out of the estate might be more sensitive in spirit and scale.

Blackstone Park's 45-acres of woods and meadows are remarkably overseen by both the Providence Parks Department and a volunteer non-profit organization called the Blackstone Parks Conservancy. In addition to contributing funds educational programs and maintenance labor the conservancy acts as a watchdog to insure that the park is maintained while its wildlife and flora are studied and nurtured.

Civic leaders too often come up with misguided schemes like stadiums wider streets or zoning-busting skyscrapers as ways to revitalize the city. Yet the Boulevard and the three sections of park along the western bank of the Seekonk River continuously offer a solution for recreation as well as a democratic access to nature. In all seasons dawn to dusk the park is there for fresh air or simply soul-restoring contemplation.

On a recent walk in Blackstone Park I spoke with a man and his grandson who were fishing for stripers. I watched two large Bernese Mountain dogs cower when approach by a rambunctious puppy. Three industrial design graduate students from RISD two from India the other from Albany were setting up a participatory design project labeled Treeggered. A tree stump had been transformed into a sculpture festooned with various sayings about the earth the forest and ""rebuilding our relationship with the natural environment.""

Two women stopped to chat. They had just completed master’s degrees at Brown. One was from Peru the other from Kenya. This was their first trip to Blackstone Park and both lamented that their scientific studies had not allowed them time to explore the city. Now that they were soon to leave they regretted not having found the park earlier declaring it their favorite spot in Providence.

Don't expect Boeing to follow suit.

Shares of Airbus (EADSY 1.29%) surged 9% on Thursday after the European plane maker told suppliers to get ready for a rapid rebound in jet production. In fact Airbus plans to boost output of narrow-body jets to record levels in as little as two years.

Boeing (BA 0.50%) stock also rose 4% on Thursday. Investors seem to believe that Airbus' aggressive production plans imply a robust aviation industry recovery that will lift demand for Boeing jets too. Yet while narrow-body jet demand should fully recover by 2024 Airbus' plan also entails gaining market share from its American rival. Thus Boeing shareholders shouldn't celebrate production increases at Airbus.

Planning for record narrow-body production

Last year Airbus slashed its commercial jet production as the COVID-19 pandemic crushed demand. By the end of 2020 it was building about 51 aircraft per month: 40 A320-family jets four A220s two A330s and five A350s. Earlier this year it bumped up the A220 production rate to five per month.

On Thursday Airbus confirmed that it intends to boost production for the A320 family to 45 per month by the fourth quarter of 2021. However it called on suppliers to prepare for A320 production to reach a record rate of 64 per month by the second quarter of 2023. Additionally Airbus told suppliers that it hopes to boost the A320 production rate to 70 per month by early 2024 and as high as 75 per month in 2025.

Airbus also confirmed that it will increase A220 output to six per month in early 2022. Up until now annual A220 deliveries have never exceeded 48 (i.e. four per month). Yet Airbus envisions building as many as 14 A220s per month ""by the middle of the decade.""

Gaining narrow-body market share

In one sense Airbus' plans shouldn't be surprising. A320-family production topped out at 60 per month prior to the pandemic but as far back as 2018 the aircraft manufacturer was interested in increasing output to more than 70 per month. Meanwhile Airbus has planned to ramp up A220 output for years thanks to a slew of orders from U.S. airlines that will be fulfilled from a new production line in Mobile Alabama.

Nevertheless aerospace analysts had expected a much slower recovery in production rates. After all most experts think global air travel demand won't return to 2019 levels until 2023. Since growth aircraft typically account for more than half of all commercial jet deliveries many analysts expected aircraft demand to remain well below pre-pandemic levels until at least 2024.

Yet demand need not return to 2019 levels for Airbus to boost narrow-body output to record rates. Instead it can rely on gaining market share at Boeing's expense. Indeed Airbus ended April with 6187 narrow-body jets in its order backlog including over 5600 A320neo-family aircraft. By contrast Boeing's 737 backlog has fallen to just 3239 units.

At the moment Airbus' goal to boost A220 production to 14 per month is aspirational. At that rate its current backlog of 494 unfilled orders would last just three years. By contrast Airbus has enough A320neo-family orders to last for seven years at a rate of 70 per month. With a backlog that long it's no wonder that the aircraft manufacturer is thinking about even higher production rates.

Boeing hopes to restore 737 output to as many as 42 per month by late 2022. That level of production -- 26% below the 57 per month rate Boeing was implementing prior to the 737 MAX grounding in 2019 -- should be sustainable. But barring a huge jump in orders that is unlikely to materialize Boeing will never get close to building 63 737s each month as it was contemplating in late 2018. Its current backlog would last barely more than four years at that production rate.

Wide-body demand remains weak

Whereas Airbus is poised to convert its backlog advantage over Boeing into an output advantage in the narrow-body market the two plane makers' wide-body backlogs are evenly matched. Unfortunately for Boeing wide-body demand remains quite weak and may never fully recover due to the disruptive potential of Airbus' A321XLR.

In its recent production update Airbus said it expects to continue building just two A330 wide-bodies per month for the foreseeable future. And while it plans to increase A350 production from five per month to six per month next fall it had been building 10 A350s a month before the pandemic.

In short Airbus' aggressive narrow-body production plans position it to seize market share from Boeing in that high-potential segment. Meanwhile Airbus sees the current wide-body slump continuing indefinitely. Together these developments suggest that Boeing's revenue earnings and cash flow will remain well below the highs reached in 2018 for the foreseeable future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9mbGFpci1haXJsaW5lcy03MzctbWF4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Canada's Flair Airlines Takes Its First Boeing 737 MAX,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9mbGFpci1haXJsaW5lcy03MzctbWF4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL2Vjb25vbXljbGFzc2FuZGJleW9uZC5ib2FyZGluZ2FyZWEuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMzAvYWlycGxhbmUtYXJ0LWJyaXRpc2gtYWlyd2F5cy1ib2VpbmctNzg3LTgtZHJlYW1saW5lci10YWtpbmctb2ZmLWZyb20tbG9uZG9uLWhlYXRocm93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airplane Art - British Airways Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner taking off from London Heathrow - Economy Class & Beyond,"It’s Sunday again so it must be time for some more Airplane Art.

This week we have a British Airways Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner taking off from London Heathrow off on its next long haul destination.

British Airways operate a fleet of 12 Boeing 787-8 Dreamlienrs. The airline also operates the first stretch Boeing 787-9 and the second stretch Boeing 787-10. As well as these Dreamliners the airline operates the Airbus A350-1000 Airbus A380 Boeing 777-200ER and Boeing 777-300ER in its long haul fleet.

They are supported by an all-Airbus short-haul fleet currently based out of Heathrow airport.

This aircraft is the class leader – G-ZBJA – the first Boeing 787-8 that British Airways received. It is configured in a three-class configuration with Club World in a 2-3-2 configuration World Traveller Plus in a 2-4-2 layout and World Traveller in the dense 3-3-3 setup with up to 214 seats installed.

It is 8 years old with the aircraft currently active serving destination such as Toronto Boston Moscow Bahrain and Dubai.

These aircraft operate on British Airways long haul routes for those which could be deemed “thin and long”.

And the main focus will be to increase investments to develop new generation aircraft.

With this extra amount NASA now plans to launch a program to develop technologies for a new single-aisle aircraft. The goal is to get a plane that is 25% more efficient compared to the current ones.

Called the “National Sustainable Flight Partnership” (SFNP) the effort will include the development of a “full-scale technology demonstration plane to test and validate integrated systems and their benefits” according to recently released NASA budget documents.

The gain in efficiency is due to the reduction in the area to generate drag in the air and also due to the greater wingspan compared to the length of the plane which compensates for the difference in width between traditional wings. The diagonal bars prevent the structure from having a behavior known as “Flutter” and structurally reinforce the component.

The goal is to be able to reduce aerodynamic drag with this concept while exploiting the fully laminar airflow along the wing.

NASA says that a wing with this type of design can save 8 to 10% of fuel compared to current planes. This data is higher than that proposed by the new Airbus project to create a laminar flow wing.

The additional economy to reach 25% is obtained with the fuselage and components built in composite materials as in the case of the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A220. The new generation engines also influence the reduction of fuel consumption.

From lab testing to a full-size prototype

According to the data released by NASA the concept presented by Boeing but studied years before by NASA will now become reality. The first flight of the prototype should take place in 2026 logically still with current generation engines.

Proving the concept in real life in 2026 is essential according to NASA for this project to be put into service starting in the next decade.

NASA intends to complement the project with studies of electric and hybrid aircraft propulsion in the case of this concept specifically hybrid propulsions a mix between electric and combustion engines. To this end the agency will allocate project and research contracts later this year to selected companies.

New combustion engines must use structures created with new alloys or composite materials. The production of these components should be up to six times faster compared to current engines.

NASA wants to ensure that these technologies will be mature enough by the end of this decade. The focus is clear on creating a single-aisle plane that is up to 25% more efficient ahead of Europe and China.

Aerospace analysts suspect that Boeing may launch a replacement program for the 737 in the coming years with entry into service in the early 2030s. Boeing has said its next project will rely heavily on improving technology integrated into its design development and manufacturing processes."

From the 33-car field to the singing of ""Back Home Again in Indiana"" to the releasing of balloons before the start of the race and the iconic Borg-Warner Trophy featuring the faces of past winners the Indy 500 is rich with history and traditions. But perhaps one of the strangest traditions of the race is the winner chugging a bottle of chilled milk in victory lane.

It's a unique tradition that has appeared in every race since 1956 and has become a snapshot moment defining the elation of victory after winning one of the world's most iconic races.

Why does the Indianapolis 500 winner drink milk?

Celebrating an Indy 500 win with milk dates back to 1933 when Louis Meyer enjoyed a glass of buttermilk after winning his second Indy 500. Meyer's mother had always told him that the best thing to drink on a hot day was buttermilk. In 1936 when Meyer won again he sipped his milk from a large glass bottle instead of a glass. An executive at what was then the Milk Foundation was so excited when he saw the photo of Meyer in Victory Lane in the next day's newspaper that he vowed to make the bottle of milk an Indy 500 staple.

The tradition was repeated for the next few years but took a brief hiatus between 1946-1955 when milk was no longer offered at the speedway. The winner has had an ice cold bottle of milk every year since then. Today all 33 drivers are polled before the race asking for their of preference of whole 2 percent or fat-free milk. Power listed no preference for his victory last year and no one has been able to confirm what variety was given to him.

Why no buttermilk?

If the tradition began with buttermilk why can't drivers choose that variety today? No it's not a conspiracy from Big Dairy but rather the American Dairy Association of Indiana looking out for drivers' taste buds. In a statement from Brooke Williams director of communication for the American Dairy Association Indiana to the Indy Star the absence of buttermilk is the result of its new taste due to mass factory production. Buttermilk in the 30s was actually left over from making butter and was rich and creamy. Today's factory version is regular milk with a culture and salt added to it creating a more sour tasting beverage.

As drivers continue to ask for buttermilk however Williams offered one possible caveat on the future of options: ""(If) we see a driver drink a full glass of buttermilk before the race"" Williams said ""we'll give them some special (consideration). For now we're keeping it to the three options.""

Who drank orange juice at the Indy 500?

The tradition of drinking milk was almost ended in 1993 by Emerson Fittipaldi. Following Fittipaldi's victory he broke tradition by chugging a bottle of orange juice as several fans booed. Fittipaldi an owner of a 500000-acre Brazilian orange grove quickly chased the OJ with the usual glass bottle of milk but the American Dairy Association of Indiana was not pleased. Fittipaldi later issued an apology.

The global headquarters of Boston Scientific a medical device manufacturer is conducting CWS around the world. There are three options under the new strategy – “On-site” for working in the office for four or five weekdays “Hybrid” for working in the office for three weekdays and “Remote” for working in the office for one weekday.

What’s noteworthy is that the CWS is a permanent work system not a stopgap measure amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Also the system applies to all employees including those in personnel PR and general affairs who used to be expected to come to the office every day.

The company did not limit the number of employees who get to pick “Hybrid.”

Boston Scientific Korea will allow all staff to choose the work type and execute the CWS in the second half of this year given the pandemic situation.

Although companies realized that working from home did not lead to low performance amid Covid-19 many of them recently returned to the previous working pattern.

However at Boston Scientific working from home has become a new normal.

Of course Boston Scientific is a for-profit company. It could adopt the new type of work because it was confident that employees could produce tangible outcomes even when they work from home.

Then how did Boston Scientific Korea become so confident about it? Korea Biomedical Review has met with Kim Na-young director of Human Resources at Boston Scientific Korea to get the answer.

Kim Na-young director of Human Resources at Boston Scientific Korea poses for a photo before an interview with Korea Biomedical Review.

Question: Why did Boston Scientific adopt CWS?

Answer: The company started the discussion for CWS about five years ago. The definition of normal is changing amid rapid social changes. Many millennials are advancing into society and their expectations from the company are different from those of older generations. One of the efforts to identify these changes and respond preemptively is CWS. By taking these steps together I became confident that Boston Scientific could predict changes and take one step faster than others.

Q: How should employees decide on their work type?

A: First they should consider the nature of their work and purpose. Plus they should reflect their needs. Some workers need time to take care of young children or old parents at home but others cannot concentrate on their work at home because of that exact reason. So employees can consider their work and personal situations discuss them with the relevant department manager and choose the work type. As salespersons and technicians have been working from home for a while they will face almost no change under the CWS. The primary target of the CWS is employees working at the office.

Q: Are there any other offshoots of Boston Scientific that adopted CWS other than the Korean offshoot?

A: The global headquarters are encouraging branches around the world to proceed with the same timeline. So all employees worldwide should choose the work type under the CWS by the end of June. As Covid-19 situations vary in different countries the company will run the CWS flexibly. In Singapore for example Boston Scientific started the CWS on April 1.

Q: It seems that the proportion of “Hybrid” is essential to make the CWS effective. What do you think?

A: In Singapore about 90 percent of those working in the office picked “Hybrid.” As Korean staff has a different culture and different types of work I think about 80 percent of those working at the office of Boston Scientific Korea could choose “Hybrid.” Surprisingly many workers do not want to work from home for too long. But this is just an estimate. We will see what choices employees will make.

Q: Can employees change the work type later?

A: After implementing the CWS for six months the company will ask their opinions and give them a chance to change the work type. After that we will provide an opportunity to reselect it regularly once a year. In addition if there is a change of work employees can change the work type.

Q: If the number of employees working from home increases do you plan to reduce the size of the office?

A: We have no plans to reduce the size of the office. However we believe that relocation is necessary. As the number of workers at the office will decrease we are preparing for office renovation to use the space efficiently according to the headquarters’ guidelines. The guidelines specifically mention adjusting space saturation ventilation the number of meeting rooms and the location of the meeting rooms. The company will send a home monitor mouse an ergonomic chair a laptop holder a webcam and headsets to those working from home.

Q: What kind of effects do you expect from the CWS?

A: With the CWS employees can become happier and more immersed in their work. The new system will also make it easier to scout talented people. Working in the office does not always increase work efficiency. If workers can have a sense of security as a family member their commitment to work will also increase.

As the HR director I can inform people that Boston Scientific has such a sound system and scout talents.

But as the company should make profits efficiency should not be compromised. As much as the company trusts employees employees should meet the expectations of the company.

Q: Industry officials worry that if companies expand the system of working from home they might reduce the workforce or lower salaries. Isn’t there such concern within Boston Scientific because of the CWS introduction?

A: As I mentioned the CWS changes the workplace and method only not the work. Then why would there be a change in salary? We don’t have any plan for workforce reduction. Instead as Boston Scientific Korea is growing we have a plan to hire more staff. I can undoubtedly say that the CWS will not affect the workforce or salary.

Q: If the CWS settles well it might affect other companies too. What do you think the company needs to adopt the CWS stably?

A: The success of the CWS adoption will hinge on the company’s trust and mature “self-leadership.” The company must trust employees to fulfill their responsibilities and achieve their business goals whether or not they can be seen whether they are at home or in the office. On the other hand employees will have to fulfill their duties with “self-leadership” no matter where they work.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxmb3JkZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzA1LzMwL2JyaWVmcy1sb2NhbC1idXNpbmVzc3Blb3BsZS1pbmNsdWRpbmcta3VydC1rYXNodWJhLXlhZ2VyLWJldGgtYmVydG9uYXNzaS1hbmQtYW15LW1hbGxldHRlLzc0Mjg3MDYwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Briefs on local businesspeople including Kurt Kashuba Will Yager Beth Bertonassi and Amy Mallette.,"The Milford Daily News

A recent study compared disease characteristics quality of life (QoL) and work productivity of patients with PsA who had disease activity in those 6 areas compared with a single area.

The researchers said they undertook the study because there have been limited real-world studies examining disease domain in these patients. In addition the right treatment may be influenced by the mix of frequency type and severity of the different disease domains they pointed out.

Using the Corrona PsA/Spondyloarthritis (PsA/SpA) Registry a large independent prospective observational cohort of individuals with PsA or SpA the researchers recruited patients from 44 private and academic practice sites across 27 states.

As of June 30 2019 data on 3939 patients with PsA/SpA had been collected. The Corrona PsA/SpA Registry includes information on 15806 patient visits with approximately 8423 patient-years of follow-up with a mean time of patient follow-up of 2.9 years (median 2.4 years).

Adults with PsA enrolled in the registry from March 2013 to August 2018 were included in the study; they were classified as having multidomain (≥ 2 domains) or single-domain disease presentations.

Of 2617 patients with PsA 1698 (64.9%) had multidomain presentations 617 (23.6%) had single-domain presentations and 302 (11.5%) had no active disease features.

The researchers characterized patients who began biologic treatment at study enrollment separately. Of 354 patients 289 (81.6%) had multidomain presentations 45 (12.7%) had single-domain presentations and 20 (5.6%) had no active disease features.

For those on biologics with single-domain vs multidomain presentations the mean (SD) ages were 52.5 (12.7) vs 51.5 (13.2) years respectively. Roughly half in each group were female (47.7% and 52.2%).

Patients on biologics and multidomain presentations were more likely to have nail psoriasis depression psoriasis and current use of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs than patients on biologics with single-domain presentations.

Overall the most common single-domain and multidomain presentations respectively were skin disease (12.7%) and PsA plus skin disease (11.7%).

Perhaps not surprisingly patients with multidomain disease were more likely to have fibromyalgia depression anxiety and prior biologic use than single-domain presenters.

Multidomain presentations were associated with significantly worse patient and physician global assessments of disease activity pain and fatigue; Health Assessment Questionnaire–Disability Index and EuroQol-5 Dimension scores; and work productivity at enrollment.

The study had some limitations such as the fact that the patient population was limited to the United States and disease domains were reported by physicians.

""These results highlight the wide spectrum of disease presentations among patients with PsA"" the authors concluded. ""Evaluation of the active disease domains is important for the development of an effective disease management plan.""

Instead of salting my steak to create a brown crust by searing I created a brown crust with notes of caramel.

Ethan Frisch co-founder of Burlap & Barrel an artisanal spice company that works with small producers worldwide laughed wryly when he heard this story over Zoom. “This is the first time in history anyone could make that mistake. Refined white-bleached sugar is a very modern development in the centuries-old sugar industry. Sugar is brown! It’s only white when you do a lot of work to remove the brownness.”

His co-founder Ori Zohar elaborated: “The whole sugar industry is focused on this pure white chemical that is so far away from being a plant: a shelf-stable consistent interchangeable ingredient. None of those qualities make for good food” though it makes an item that can be traded around the world for similar base prices.

Many of us only know white granulated sugar that comes packaged with no information about its sugarcane or beet origins – much less its geographical origins – on its package. But sugar is diverse. White processed sugar makes up the largest segment of the global market but sugar also comes in liquid and brown forms. About 80% of the world’s production comes from sugarcane but some comes from beets. Even sugarcane itself is not a monolith; though most sugar is derived from the Saccharum officinarum species and its hybrids there are hundreds of varieties which have adapted (or been adapted through human intervention) to their specific ecosystems.

Zohar and Frisch are on a mission to “do to sugar what has been done to salt” in the last few years. You can now buy specialty salts from specific places and have specific characteristics: a black Himalayan salt that has a sulphurous funk or Burlap and Barrel’s Pearl salt from Tanzania’s Swahili coast with its surprisingly spherical crystals.

Saltverk which sells hand-harvested salt from Iceland has been riding this wave. Founder Björn Steinar Jónsson said “People want to know where the products they’re buying are from. We’ve seen this as a gradual growth in the salt industry and really we’re only at the beginning stages of where people understand what’s going into their salts. As a staple ingredient used by most of the world sugar could follow a similar path.”

This is not just marketing. A sugar’s texture and taste can be as individual as coffee beans from a corner of Ethiopia or wine grapes grown on a chilly slope in the Pacific north-west.

Brown sugar from Okinawa in Japan is a favorite of pastry chef Salvatore Martone of Le Jardinier in New York. He said: “Okinawa brown sugar (kokuto) is produced on eight remote Japanese islands. Each island produces sugar that has a slightly different taste. The sugar is sold in small irregular lumps and the flavor is rich minerally smokiness with an earthy undertone and a hint of bitterness.” He uses it for ice-cream.

Burlap & Barrel’s founders want to introduce consumers to sugars connected to a specific place and that have a distinctive flavor born of the environment that produced them. The company’s work expands the market for traceable sugar focusing on sourcing from communities using traditional processing methods.

It’s introduced panela a traditionally unrefined cane sugar from Boyacá Colombia. In June the company is launching two other single-origin sugars jaggery from Satara district India and a granulated sugar from Portvale Barbados. When the company uses the term “single-origin” it doesn’t merely refer to a country of origin but a single farm or producer.

Had I reached for their sand-textured panela in making my steak I could not have mistaken it for salt. Its soft irregular granules are the color of milk caramel with which it shares similar aromas. A spoonful is like sucking on sweet cinnamon toffee. It melts on the tongue leaving a trace of floral spice as if I took a shot of ginger juice.

The jaggery has the varied irregular texture and look of crushed peanuts and opening it fills my apartment with the scent of fresh squeezed sugarcane. It comes from Dr Shashikant Salunkhe who has grown turmeric for Burlap & Barrel as part of a regenerative agricultural system. A local refiner filters the raw sugarcane juice with wild okra whose gel collects any floating impurities. The jaggery is granulated and then stone ground ancient methods that are worlds away from industrial filtration and mechanized refinement.

The Barbadian sugar’s crystals are startlingly angular and crunch loudly between one’s teeth.

“Barbadian sugar has to de-commoditize if they’re going to compete globally” said Frisch. This means that the country’s producers need to embrace their sugar as a specialty product and divert it from being blended with other sugars before it reaches supermarket shelves where it will be simply labeled “cane sugar”. Frisch wants people to understand what makes Barbadian sugar so good – the terroir of its coral island flavors enhanced by molasses cane fed by rainwater and not irrigation like in most industrial practices and its history.

View image in fullscreen Sugar production has an ugly past with roots in slavery and abhorrent working conditions into the present. Photograph: Ethan Frisch

Sugar production has an ugly past. About 5 million slaves were brought to the Caribbean most to toil on sugar plantations starting in the mid-1500s. The slave trade reached its height in the 1700s and Barbados known as Sugar Island was its crown jewel. Abolitionists in Europe and the US waged boycotts of sugar a slave-derived good that represented abhorrent working conditions.

Centuries later Frisch and Zohar want consumers to demand sugars that retain their individual nuanced flavors. “Home cooks and chefs have huge buying power” said Zohar which could advance more sustainable and equitable production. Sugarcane farms are responsible for massive deforestation. Added to innumerable food products sugar drives the global obesity epidemic. Sugar from the Dominican Republic’s Central Romana corporation which is often supplied to and sold as Domino brand has been banned from the US since November 2023 due to allegations about exploitative work conditions and forced labor among its largely Haitian migrant workforce.

But as of the moment it’s difficult to know exactly where your sugar comes from. Non-alcoholic beverage company Everleaf goes to extraordinary lengths to source botanicals. Founder Paul Mathew is a conservation biologist and his company has tracked down “cherry blossoms hand-picked in the Shizuoka region of Japan between May and August” and gum acacia used for mouthfeel from the Sahel region of Africa.

That wasn’t possible with sugar which Mathew said is all being “hoovered up into a commodity-based industrial system”. The UK-based company is currently switching from fair-trade sugar derived from sugarcane to beet sugar from the UK prioritizing a lesser carbon footprint.

One way for a company to know where its sugar comes from is for that business to grow it themself. This is what Copalli Rum in Belize chooses to do. The majority of rum is made from molasses produced when sugarcane juice is boiled multiple times in sugar’s refining process and sucrose is removed. But new agricole-style rums which are made from fermenting fresh sugarcane juice like Copalli are emerging from former commodity sugar plantation fields from Hawaii to Belize. Copalli uses red and black cane instead of yellow cane engineered over many years to produce commercial sugar in Belize.

Wil Maheia the philanthropy services advisor for Copalli has tended to this area his entire life. His great-grandparents worked the land when it was a sugarcane plantation and he helped organize Belize’s first debt-for-nature swap (a transaction where a country’s debt is exchanged for environmental conservation commitments).

He’s proud to say: “We have never cut any rainforest to plant cane.” To the contrary – Copalli is cultivating 220 acres of sugarcane on old citrus orchards rather than reaching into 12000 acres of rainforest. As the largest employer in southern Belize it’s creating jobs that do not rely on the logging industry and deforestation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd2VhdGhlci5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS9uYXR1cmUvdmlkZW8vYnJvd24tYmVhci1jaGFyZ2VzLWF0LWNhci1pbi1qYXBhbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brown Bear Charges At Car In Japan - Videos from The Weather Channel,"Weather in your inbox

Horner refuted those comments stating that it was ""inevitable"" that other teams wished to capitalise on the situation.

Verstappen agreed with his team principal noting that Red Bull's successes had made many of its staff targets for other teams seeking to improve their own fortunes in F1.

""He obviously wants to stir things up. For us as a team we can't do anything with comments like that"" Verstappen said.

""From his point of view I understand it of course because everyone is trying to attract our people and that is completely normal in the world of Formula 1 as well.

""But I'm not really interested in those things either. I see the headlines but I don't even click on them.""

Verstappen added that many of Red Bull's key staff were subject to long-term contracts with the Milton Keynes squad although admitted that there were ""human aspects"" that had to be taken into account.

The Dutch driver is contracted to Red Bull until the end of 2028 but has been targeted by Mercedes as a potential replacement for the Ferrari-bound Lewis Hamilton in the event that Verstappen becomes dissatisfied at Red Bull.

He felt that he was in a similar position to those at Red Bull bound by long-term deals and that those contracts were not a ""100 per cent"" guarantee that people would stay on if they were not happy.

""In life you can never guarantee everything. It's also possible that I won't wake up tomorrow morning so in the end you never know things 100 percent for sure in life anyway.

For example North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee even cited however insincerely socialists!!! as the development that drove him to switch parties and become a Republican. (Oh and run for governor which is a thing he says he is doing.)

Now it turns out there is a not insignificant plot by the Proud Boys to take control of the Clark County Republican Party and it’s looking like the Nevada Republican Party is a Proud Boys enabler.

So if the Proud Boys is successful does this mean John Lee will have to switch parties again? Will all the Republican politicians have to switch parties?

I guess as an alternative they could double down on Trumpism to earn the Proud Boys’ endorsement.

Take that Mark Amodei. Republican politician and Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo last week publicly confirmed that he will mount a campaign for governor. Ever since Lombardo was elected sheriff Southern Nevada broadcast media have given him oodles of airtime most of it pretty cuddly. So naturally Lombardo gave his confirmation to a TV station in … Reno.

Well! Since Lombardo went big-footing in Republican congressman and gubernatorial race ditherer Mark Amodei’s back yard if Amodei decides to join a primary against JL² (Joe Lombardo and John Lee) Amodei should confirm that to a media outlet that operates out of Las Vegas. Call me Mark. I’ll hook you up.

So far all Amodei’s saying by the way is if he decides not to run for governor it won’t be because he’s a-scared he can’t beat JL². He notes he’s won elections in the sticks where all the Republicans are and Lombardo and Lee have not.

But back to the flavor of the week i.e Lombardo. His remarks to the Reno reporter were very very brief so everyone is left waiting for the answer to the biggest and most obvious question surrounding Lombardo’s candidacy: Why?

But oh look a Dean Heller sighting. I noticed Politico’s piece on Dean Heller’s gubernatorial aspirations quotes Haley Barbour. I confess I was not under the impression that Haley Barbour is still a thing. Similarly it’s by no means clear that Dean Heller is still a thing.

Heller and Adam Laxalt didn’t lose in 2018 because of the outstanding quality of their opponents. They lost because Trump was occupying the White House. It’s still Trump’s party and he wants to make the midterm elections all about him. Part of me hopes in this instance he gets what he wants. And as with his buddies the aforementioned Proud Boys it’ll be a hoot to see who Trump endorses in the Nevada GOP primary for governor.

I hope Heller runs because it will add to the fun. You see while perhaps not as pronounced as when I was younger I’ve still got a sadistic side.

Nevada to New Hampshire: Buzz off. Unlike states where Republicans control legislatures Nevada is not passing a bunch of mean-spirited voter-suppression legislation deliberately designed to make it harder for people who aren’t white to vote. But! Nevada lawmakers are passing four election bills the most glitzy of which would dump the dumb caucus for a first-in-the-nation presidential primary. (If you combined the impact of the other three it would effectively mean centrally registered voters could cast straight-ticket ballots by mail.)

I have mixed feelings about the first-in-the-nation thing. On the one hand the novelty of a presidential wannabe on every Las Vegas street corner has sort of worn off. Besides we’re Nevada. We don’t need the nation’s political press corps parachuting in so as to shine a spotlight on our humble little state. Because we’re not a humble little state. We’re brash and loud and famous and the entire world knows we want to take their money and they come here and give it to us anyway. (Except for owners of battery factories and football teams in which case we give them money.) Craving political-media-industrial complex stardom seems demeaning even off-brand and something some Dakota or other would do.

On the other hand it’s weird to let a few snowbound farmers have an outsized influence on the nominating process. In those years that New Hampshire has any influence anymore that is.

Mars. Sigh. Does MGM – the movie one not the casino one – still make movies? Anyway Bezos bought it.

Speaking of Bezos he was mad because Elon got all the federal money to go to the moon so Jeff whined and got a senator to try to get Jeff some sweet sweet federal money to go to the moon too. And Bernie Sanders is calling it the “Bezos bailout.”

One could argue s’pose that no person on earth needs federal money less than Bezos. OK except for Elon. Meanwhile it’s never been exactly clear to me what needs to be done by humans on the moon in the first place. And don’t give me that way-station-to-Mars noise; we are decades away from having the techy techy to safely send humans to Mars and bring them home again and even assuming the techy techy gets developed some day there is no reason to send humans there. Mars is a hellhole and space is always looking for ways to kill you. Might as well build a colony at the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Living/working conditions would be about the same. Mars. Gah.

The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas is the latest resort on the Strip to begin charging again for parking.

Beginning June 1 non-hotel guests can park their own car for free for the first hour. After that the cost for self-parking is $10 for up to four hours and $15 for four to 24 hours according to the Cosmopolitan website. Motorcycles are exempt from parking fees.

Registered hotel guests are allowed to park for free. Local residents can park free for up to three hours the Cosmopolitan website states. Locals are required to show a valid Nevada ID.

For valet parking non-hotel guests will be charged $15 dollars for up to four hours. The valet fee is $20 for four to 24 hours. Registered hotel guests are permitted to use valet parking as a complimentary service.

The return to paid parking on June 1 is the result of an increase in travel to the area the Cosmopolitan said in a statement to KSNV-TV. Starting on June 1 casinos across the state can operate at full capacity. Many resorts including the Cosmopolitan already are operating at 100 percent gaming floor capacity based on employee COVID-19 vaccination policy.

The $4.1 billion Cosmopolitan first opened in December 2010 on the west side of the Strip. It towers over the older Jockey Club just south of the Bellagio.

MGM Caesars Restore Fees

Other resorts on the Strip also are reinstating parking fees that were waived last year at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.

Also beginning June 1 paid self-parking is returning to the MGM Resorts properties. Most of these resorts are on the west side of the Strip including some near T-Mobile Arena home of the NHL’s Vegas Golden Knights. Special parking rates apply for Golden Knights games and other arena events. Payment for these events can be arranged ahead of time on the MGM Resorts website.

At the Caesars Entertainment resorts on the Strip self-parking is free for hotel guests and Nevada residents. The first hour is free for all guests. Fees for non-hotel guests range from $12 to $18 according to the company’s website. Many of the Caesars Entertainment properties are on the east side of the Strip.

‘Tone Deaf’ on Paid Parking

Parking fees are a sore spot for many visitors and Las Vegas residents especially for those who remember decades of free parking.

Bob Coffin a former Nevada legislator and Las Vegas City Council member has written on his Facebook page that casinos need to “wake up and smell the Bermuda grass” on the paid parking issue.

Lord please save our city from hedge funds and their genius at making empty husks out of once-great properties” he wrote on May 25.

Coffin also reacted to parking fees in a 2017 Facebook post.

“The CEO class on the Strip needs to hear something. Something they are either too young too new or too tone deaf to understand. Hear it from this 74-year-old resident of 66 years with 50 years of political experience” he wrote four years ago. “Your gaming taxes are low because of your long friendly connection to the citizens of Nevada. … Now that connection is becoming tenuous because of changes like this.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmRzY2hhdC5jb20vbmV3cy9hdGxhbnRpYy1jaXR5LXBva2VyLXJvb21zLXJlbW92ZS1jb3ZpZC1yZWxhdGVkLXNlYXRpbmctcmVzdHJpY3Rpb25zLTEwMDg3Mi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Atlantic City Poker Rooms Remove COVID-Related Seating Restrictions,"Atlantic City casinos returned to full seating capacity at poker tables and other gambling stations on Friday. The move came as New Jersey further relaxed its COVID-19 restrictions just in time for the Memorial Day weekend. With the return to full seating the city’s poker rooms may be the busiest they’ve been since the pandemic-induced shutdowns occurred in March 2020.

Full capacity at the tables is just one of several changes being allowed under New Jersey’s latest guidelines. Atlantic City’s poker rooms will be allowed to remove the plexiglass dividers between each seat and players who have been fully vaccinated will be allowed to play without masks. No protocols for checking an individual’s vaccination status have been announced inferring that an “honor system” regarding vaccinations and mask-wearing will be in place.

The relaxed protocols went into effect at 6am on Friday as infectivity rates declined across New Jersey with more than 48% of the population now reported as being fully vaccinated.

Atlantic City poker rooms lagged behind slow recovery

The updated protocols as announced by the office of New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy promise a much needed boost for the region’s economy during the busy summer months. In 2020 Atlantic City casinos were completely closed during the Memorial Day period; after being mandated to close in March they were not allowed to open until July.

Live poker took even longer to return. The first Atlantic City poker room to reopen was its largest the 77-table room at the Borgata and that didn’t occur until October 2020. When it did the room initially offered only cash-game action and a maximum of seven players per table.

Similar restrictions hampered all gambling activity at all of the Atlantic City’s casinos. Overall New Jersey’s gross gaming revenue dropped by more than 80% in 2020 even though the state’s online-gambling sites enjoyed traffic surges during the worst of the pandemic’s larger impact.

Indoor protocol relaxation key to casinos’ hopes

Caesars Entertainment’s Noel Stevenson told the Press of Atlantic City that the relaxation of indoor restrictions were key to the venues’ recovery. New Jersey removed most outdoor restrictions one week ago but the greater risk of indoor virus transmission made the state wait a little longer to make its move.

“Caesars Harrah’s Resort and Tropicana are pleased to see the return of indoor events entertainment meetings and conventions and more of the amenities our guests expect from our resorts” Stevenson told the Press. “Gov. Murphy’s most recent order allows us to take a needed step forward in our recovery effort. It will enable us to fully reopen this summer just in time for Atlantic City’s peak season.”",,,

Why doesn’t the Fed share the rest of the world’s concerns about food inflation?

The impact of food inflation differs across countries and income levels

The Federal Reserve regards current inflation conditions to be transitory. They see the impact of food inflation as minimal since the weighting of food and beverages on the overall CPI basket is only 10% to 15%. The U.S. CPI is heavily weighted towards housing. The core PCE price index one of the central bank’s favorite measures of inflation excludes the more volatile and seasonal food and energy prices. Through this lens the Fed is correct is in their assessment but that’s not the story for the rest of the world. In most emerging economies food and beverage is a much more important part of their consumer baskets (see graphs below).

Changes in relative currency valuation over the past year have made the matter even worse for some countries. For example Brazil has experienced greater demand for exports because they are cheaper for foreign buyers and as such their domestic supply has become strained.

Likewise food inflation creates a heavier burden for lower income families widening the wealth gap globally.

Why does the food industry worry about inflation?

As early as Q3/Q4 2020 quite a few food companies expressed concerns about inflation. For example in Q1 2021 B&G Foods Inc. (BGS) cited escalating SG&A expenses and input cost inflation as key concerns for the company going forward.

In addition to surging commodities prices pandemic-related restrictions have increased logistical costs over the past year. Even if one assumes that logistical costs will come down as economy recovers wages are likely to trend higher over time. Many food companies will see double-digit increases to their costs this year – some of which are not transitory.

Large food companies such as B&G Foods have been able to pass some cost increases to consumers over the past year but if cost inflation keeps up their pricing power may be limited for several reasons. One is that wholesale retail prices for consumer products generally lag the underlying commodities prices. In 2020 and 2021 YTD corn commodity prices have jumped >20% annually whereas process sweet corn price remained roughly the same (see table below).

% Change YoY 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Consumer Product Processed Sweet Corn Price ($/ton) -10.2% 1.5% -4.9% -2.6% Commodity Corn Commodity Price ($/bushel) -0.4% 6.9% 3.4% 24.8% 28.2%

Another reason is that price competition would likely keep retail prices in check. Walmart said it had about 30% more discounts in stores in Q1 than during the same period a year ago. Retail giants like Walmart can push prices lower due to their comprehensive mix of products and well-managed supply chain. If other companies cannot keep up they may face the tough choice of losing market share or sacrificing margin.

It will also be the first day where Capital Arena hosts a Wizards game and sports betting simultaneously on-site.

Last Wednesday the William Hill Sports Book officially opened its Washington location which is in Capital One Arena’s facility. More specifically the sportsbook is where the Greene Turtle restaurant was. This is the first such facility of its kind in the United States where a gambling facility is literally inside the arena. Wednesday was big but today’s is also just as significant because there will be also game going on at the same place where fans can make bets.

Unless you work for MSE if you want to bet on the Wizards game tonight or the Capitals for the NHL when they’re back or Mystics for the WNBA you can. In addition you can walk directly from the sportsbook to the arena concourse at any time with a ticket. That won’t be allowed during Capitals NHL games however according to Action Network.

There is also a mobile app within two blocks of the arena outside of federal buildings like the adjacent National Portrait Gallery.

The William Hill Sports Book’s situation is a little different than some other teams with arenas in casinos. For example the Las Vegas Aces WNBA team’s arena the Michelob Ultra Arena (f/k/a Mandalay Bay Events Center) is part of the same complex as the casino. But they are still a bit distant physically from each other.

Furthermore people at the Mandalay Bay and other MGM casinos (including MGM National Harbor) couldn’t bet on Aces games though anyone could bet on other WNBA games at least when MGM owned the team. Raiders NFL team owner Mark Davis is the current owner.

SUMMARY

The Wizards were defeated by the Sixers 132-103 on Saturday night in Game 3 of the teams’ first round series. Washington now trails 0-3 and will look to avoid a sweep in Game 4 on Monday night at Capital One Arena. Russell Westbrook led the way for Washington with 26 points 12 rebounds and 10 assists. Joel Embiid scored a game-high 36 points.

Shortly after the Wizards opened the game making their first three field goals the Sixers answered with an 8-0 run prompting a Washington timeout. Davis Bertans making his first start of the postseason knocked down a three coming out of the break but the Wizards couldn’t slow down the Sixers’ momentum. Philadelphia took a 10-point lead on a Tobias Harris 3-pointer and led by as many as 16 in the opening frame. Washington closed the first quarter on a 14-6 run highlighted by a fast break layup from Davis Bertans off a Daniel Gafford block to cut the lead to eight points entering the second quarter. Seven consecutive points from Westbrook to start the second quarter cut the lead to 40-36. Westbrook played the entire second quarter totaling 12 points three rebounds and three assists. Washington however couldn’t pull any closer. Philadelphia shot 14-22 (.636) from the field and 5-8 (.625) from three in the second quarter and led 72-58 at halftime.

Westbrook opened the second half with 3-pointers on consecutive possessions before a pair of threes by the Sixers put a halt to the Wizards’ run. Beal and Westbrook combined for 17 points in the third but Harris and Joel Embiid were too much for the Washington defense to handle. The Sixers’ frontcourt duo combined for 22 points on 9-9 (1.000) shooting in the third sparking a 22-9 run that put Philadelphia up 27. The Wizards turned to their reserves for most of the fourth quarter and were unable to put a dent in Philadelphia’s advantage. Washington shot just 6-23 (.26.1) from the field and 0-11 (.000) from three in the final frame.

THREE THINGS TO KNOW

Westbrook overcomes ankle injury for 11th career playoff triple-double

After sustaining a right ankle sprain in Game 2 in Philadelphia Westbrook’s availability for Game 3 was not determined until just before tip. Despite going back and forth from the court to the locker room for treatment throughout the game the former MVP still managed to put on a standout performance on efficient shooting. He finished with a team-high 26 points 12 rebounds and 10 assists his 11th career playoff triple-double tied with Jason Kidd for third in NBA history behind only Magic Johnson (30) and Lebron James (28). Westbrook has scored 20-plus points in 10 of his 11 career playoff triple-doubles. Only James (26) and Johnson (12) have more 20-10-10 playoff games in NBA history. Westbrook shot 9-18 (.500) from the field and 3-6 (.500) from 3-point range.

Beal inches closer to 1000 career playoff points

Beal continued what has been a strong series. He finished the night with 25 points on 10-26 (.384) shooting and just 1-8 (.125) from three to go along with six rebounds and three assists. He did most of his damage in the first half scoring 14 points on 6-12 (.500) shooting. Beal finished two points shy of his 1000th career playoff point a milestone he’ll reach early on in Game 4. With 998 career playoff points Beal now trails only Elvin Hayes (1997) Wes Unseld (1260) and Phil Chenier (1088) on the team’s all-time playoff scoring list.

Embiid continues dominant series performance

The Wizards have had trouble slowing down Joel Embiid all series long and Saturday night was no different. After averaging 26.0 points per game on 60.7% shooting and finishing a combined plus-39 in 56 minutes in Games 1 and 2 Embiid put up his most impressive stat line of the series. The Sixers’ center totaled 36 points on 14-18 (.777) from the field 3-4 (.750) from 3-point range and 5-7 (.714) from the free throw line to go along with eight rebounds three steals and a block. Embiid finished plus-29 in 28 minutes of action.

Or will the Washington Wizards somehow find a way to extend the series?

We’ll find out 7 p.m. Monday in Game 4 of their opening-round series. The Sixers took a commanding 3-0 advantage in the best-of-seven competition with a 132-103 Game 3 victory at Capital One Arena.

“That will be incredible” Ben Simmons said of possibly closing out on Monday and having off until June 6 at the earliest. “We want to get the sweep so we can get some rest. But this is a tough team. You never know what you are going to get every night especially with [Bradley] Beal and [Russell] Westbrook.

“So we’ve got to come prepared on Monday.”

No NBA team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit to win a playoff series. Only three series have gone to a seventh game after one team opened with a 3-0 lead.

The last time the Sixers swept an opponent was when they beat the Milwaukee Bucks three-games-to-none in a best-of-five first-round series in 1991. The last time they swept a best-of-seven series was when they prevailed 4-0 in the second round against the Bucks in 1985. The first-round playoff series went to a best-of-seven format in 2003.

On this night there were close to 10000 in attendance. However a sizable portion was vocal Sixers fans. They even chanted “MVP” when Sixers center Joel Embiid an MVP finalist was at the foul line.

But that didn’t stop him from trolling Wizards fans in the building after a dunk.

Embiid faked a pass to Seth Curry before blowing by Wizards reserve center Daniel Gafford at the three-point line. After driving the lane Embiid was fouled by Gafford while dunking the ball. Before going to the foul line Embiid walked over to the corner of the court. He was cupping his hands up to ears to encourage boos from the Washington fans.

This came moments after he missed a thunderous dunk attempt over Gafford that violently bounced out of bounds.

“They let me hear about it” Embiid said of crowd on his missed dunk. “I’ve mentioned in the past I love playing on the road. They started booing they started chanting because I missed a dunk. I had another opportunity and I made a dunk. That’s why I went over to them. I wanted to hear more boos because it gets me going.”

Embiid said the alternative is cheering for him. He actually received a lot of that from the Sixers fans in attendance. Some of them even waited in the arena for Embiid to finish a postgame television interview. They chanted “MVP” again and cheered when he finished the interview and made his way to the tunnel. Before leaving the floor he tossed his warm-up jersey to a fan in the crowd.

“It felt like this was a Philly crowd” Embiid said. “It felt like we had more fans. In the past it’s always been that way. You know our fans have always showed up and they’ve always been louder on the road especially here in D.C.

“So tonight we felt the same.”

Embiid gave the fans who made the two-plus-hour drive from Philly a lot to cheer about. The four-time All-Star finished with a career-playoff-high 36 points to go with eight rebounds and three steals. The big fella hit 3 of 4 three-pointers. Twenty-five of his points came in the first half. He played just 27 minutes 54 seconds while sitting out the fourth quarter.

“I can’t imagine anybody playing better than him” Wizards coach Scott Brooks. “That was MVP level tonight. Tried different things on him. Good player I mean he’s definitely a handful.”

Tobias Harris finished with 20 points 13 rebounds and five assists. And Simmons added 14 points nine assists and five rebounds. Danny Green and Curry each had 15 points. Green made a game-high five three-pointers on nine attempts. As a team the Sixers made 17 of 33 threes for 51.5%. They shot 58.6% overall from the field.

The Wizards were paced by their standout backcourt of Beal and Westbrook.

Westbrook had 26 points 12 rebounds and 10 assists after being a game-time decision with a sprained right ankle. Beal finished with 25 points on 10-for-26 shooting including just 1-for-8 from three. The All-Star shooting guard was a minus-29. Davis Bertans was a game-worst minus-34. He finished with eight points on 2-for-6 shooting. He missed four of his five three-point attempts.

As a team the Wizards shot just 39.6% including going 8-of-35 (22.9%) on three-pointers.

“We didn’t play the way we would have loved to play obviously” Brooks said. “But they have a lot to do with it. It’s a very talented experienced team. They are championship ready right? I don’t think they would surprise anybody [if they won the championship.]”

The Wizards shook up the rotation as a way to combat the Sixers’ height advantage with 7-foot-2 Embiid 6-11 Simmons and 6-8 Harris.

In the first two games the Wizards started 6-1 guard Raul Neto to play alongside Westbrook (6-3) and Beal (6-3) in the backcourt. On Saturday Bertans a 6-10 forward took the place of Neto a former Sixer in the lineup.

That enabled the Wizards to size up with the Sixers with a frontcourt of Bertans Rui Hachimura (6-8) and center Alex Len (7-0). Bertans gave them someone who can stretch the floor in the starting lineup.

Bertans had zero points on 0-for-4 shooting to go with zero assists zero rebounds zero steals and zero blocks while fouling out in 24 minutes in Game 2. But Bertans had 14 points while making 4 of 8 three-pointers in Game 1. He’s a career 40.7% three-point shooter.

So the Wizards had Bertans guarding Harris at the beginning. Hachimura was on Simmons and Len continued to guard Embiid.

That didn’t work out well.

Simmons began the game by putting on another attack-the-rim clinic. He scored six of the Philly’s first 12 points. His sixth point came on a dunk. Curry was double-teamed near the three-point line. He drilled the ball to Simmons underneath the basket for the easy dunk.

“I thought that was key” coach Doc Rivers said of Simmons’ aggressive start. “You know that’s two games where Ben recognized the coverage. You know they changed the coverage after Game 1. Ben recognized that. Today they changed the personnel on him. And I thought Ben really saw that early.

“After we saw it we were posting every time every time because he creates matchups.”

The Wizards made some adjustments but the Sixers had a 36-28 lead after one quarter. They shot 52% from the field and benefited from the Wizards missing eight of nine three-point attempts.

The Sixers went on to lead 72-58 at intermission. Then they had a commanding 31-point lead in the fourth quarter.

Following the game Rivers said “Great job and we’ve done nothing.”

They were the same two things he’s said after all three series games. However this team is closing in on its first sweep in 30 years.

Surely the Sixers want to get a sweep. But is that something Rivers doesn’t want them to focus on too heavily?

“You can’t focus on the results anyway” he said. “You got to focus on what you are doing at the time and all the results will happen.

“You start focusing on what will happen you are not going to get it. You’ve got to focus on doing your job.”"

By Eric Eyre and Amelia Ferrell Knisely Mountain State Spotlight

CHARLESTON — The nation’s three largest drug distributors failed to set up effective programs to stop prescription painkillers from being diverted and sold illegally on the black market a former investigator with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration testified Wednesday at a landmark trial in Charleston.

After analyzing DEA data and the companies’ “due diligence” files James Rafalski an expert witness for the City of Huntington and Cabell County concluded the wholesale distributors — McKesson Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen — didn’t properly report suspiciously large orders of pain pills to the DEA for more than a decade.

During the trial now in its fourth week the companies’ executives have pinned much of the blame for the opioid crisis on the DEA’s failure to act. Rafalski’s testimony Wednesday provided a look into what he called the distributors’ flawed reporting practices.

“The systemic [failure] was widespread” Rafalski said. He included the Huntington market in that failure.

Paul Farrell Jr. Cabell County’s lawyer argued the drug companies never pulled the fire alarm despite numerous warnings about suspicious orders of oxycodone and hydrocodone.

“This should have been blocked” he said.

Cabell County and Huntington filed lawsuits against the drug distributors in 2017 alleging the companies caused a “scourge of death and addiction” by flooding their communities with powerful prescription painkillers. More than 3000 local governments across America have filed similar lawsuits. Cabell County and Huntington are the first to have their cases go to trial.

Rafalski’s findings echoed the conclusions of a 2018 congressional investigation into “pill’’ dumping” by the same distributors in West Virginia.

On Wednesday attorneys for the distributors suggested that doctors manufacturers like OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma and the DEA were to blame for the opioid epidemic.

The companies’ lawyers said DEA field offices didn’t keep track of reports about suspicious orders of pain pills and some offices didn’t even know that distributors were supposed to submit the reports. The DEA has never established standards to help distributors identify suspect orders from pharmacies according to the distributors.

The companies’ attorneys also pointed fingers at regional distributor Miami-Luken which shipped large quantities of prescription opioids to Cabell County. Miami-Luken closed several years ago after two of its former executives were indicted on federal charges for failing to identify and block suspicious orders from now-shuttered pharmacies in West Virginia and other states.

What’s more the distributors’ lawyers noted that the DEA approved opioid manufacturing quotas that allowed higher numbers of painkillers nationwide amid a surge of drug overdose deaths.

Rafalski testified Wednesday that distributors before 2007 would flag orders that looked suspicious but still ship the opioid drugs to pharmacies and report the questionable orders to the DEA at a later date.

Since then the companies have blocked those sales while reviewing them. Each distributor established its own program for identifying suspicious orders — typically by placing monthly limits on painkiller sales to individual pharmacies.

“We wanted to allow them flexibility” Rafalski said Wednesday of the drug distributors each setting up its own program.

The opioid crisis — first triggered when people got hooked on easily available prescription painkillers then switched to heroin and now fentanyl and methamphetamine — has been costly: thousands of lives lost families torn apart grandparents raising children overcrowded jails and soaring addiction treatment costs.

Huntington and Cabell County along with other local governments in West Virginia have opted out of a tentative $26 billion national settlement with the three distributors and with one of the manufacturers of opioids Johnson & Johnson. Farrell has said West Virginia’s portion of the “global” settlement wasn’t nearly enough. The Mountain State’s potential share has yet to be disclosed to the public.

The Pope had made him a Cardinal 6 months ago on 28 November 2020.

By Robin Gomes

Cardinal Cornelius Sim the first cardinal of Brunei the tiny Southeast Asian state in the island of Borneo passed away in Taiwan on Saturday 29 May.

Pope Francis sent his condolences to all the faithful of the Church in Brunei later that same day.

""With gratitude for Cardinal Sim’s faithful witness to the Gospel his generous service to the Church in Brunei and to the Holy See I willingly join the faithful in praying for his eternal rest"" said the Pope.

He extended his Apostolic Blessing upon all who mourn the late Cardinal ""as a pledge of consolation and peace in Jesus the firstborn of the dead.""

Suffering from poor health

Fr. Robert Leong the Vicar General of the Apostolic Vicariate of Brunei Darussalam announced Cardinal Sim's death in a statement on Saturday.

The 69-year-old native of Brunei passed away at around 8:28 am in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) Taoyuan City Taiwan. After his arrival at the hospital on May 8 the cardinal had to undergo a regulation quarantine before undergoing cell therapy treatment.

“They attended to his health condition every day but unfortunately everything they did doesn't seem to be very effective. He gradually became weaker and has lost most of his vitality. Sadly he passed away this morning” Fr. Leong said. The funeral will be announced at a later date he said urging all to pray for his soul and for the Vicariate.

The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Malaysia Singapore and Brunei based in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia also announced his death saying he passed away “due to cardiac arrest”.

The Catholic weekly newspaper Herald Malaysia said he died while undergoing treatment for cancer.

Engineer turned pastor

Cardinal Sim was born on 16 September 1951 the eldest in a family of 6 children. The qualified electrical engineer had a diploma in electrical engineering from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia in 1971 after which he obtained a B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Dundee University UK in 1978.

After a successful career of 10 years with the British–Dutch multinational oil and gas company Shell in Brunei and in Europe he made a major decision to study for the priesthood much against his mother’s wish. He obtained a master's degree in theology from the Franciscan University of Steubenville Ohio in 1988.

After returning to Brunei in 1988 he served as administrator at St John's Church in Kuala Belait until his ordination as deacon on 28 May 1989.

Brunei’s first native clergyman

At his priestly ordination on 26 November 1989 Father Cornelius Sim became the first native priest of Brunei.

In 1995 he was appointed the Vicar General of what was then Miri-Brunei Diocese and when Pope Saint John Paul II separated Brunei from the Diocese of Miri-Brunei and established the Apostolic Prefecture of Brunei in 1998 he appointed Father Sim its prefect. When Brunei became an Vicariate Apostolic on 20 October 2004 he became its Vicar Apostolic.

At his consecration on 21 January 2005 he became the first native bishop of Brunei. On 28 November 2020 he was among 13 candidates whom Pope Francis made cardinals at the consistory.

However due to the Covid-19 pandemic and health reasons he could not attend the consistory in Rome but the Pope sent him the cardinal’s red hat and ring to Brunei.

On 16 December 2020 he was named a member of the Congregation for the Clergy. Cardinal Sim was cardinal for exactly 6 months.

Shepherd of expatriate Catholic community

Assisted by 3 priests Cardinal Sim headed the tiny Catholic community of Brunei which is mainly made up of some 20000 expatriate workers.

The wealthy oil- and gas-rich nation has a population of some 500000 people more than 70% percent of whom are Muslim.

In an interview with Vatican News the late cardinal had said that the main task of the Bruneian Church is to “provide a home away from home” for the largely migrant Catholic community.

Hence the Church tries its best to support them especially in times of trouble such as illness or death. It also helps them financially and with food assistance programmes.

Following the death of Cardinal Sim the number of cardinals worldwide now stands at 222 cardinals from 87 countries. Of these 125 are below 80 years of age and therefore are eligible to vote for a new pope in the case of a conclave. The rest 97 are non-electors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vY2JjcG5ld3MubmV0L2NiY3BuZXdzL2NhcmRpbmFsLXNpbS1vZi1icnVuZWktcGFzc2VzLWF3YXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cardinal Sim of Brunei dies at age 69,"Cardinal Cornelius Sim the first and only cardinal from Brunei died Saturday in Taiwan where he was undergoing cancer treatment.

The cardinal passed away at around 8:28am in the city of Taoyuan’s Chang Gung Memorial Hospital the Apostolic Vicariate of Brunei Darussalam said in a statemment.

He was 69.

Monsignor Robert Leong the vicar general said that Sim arrived in Taiwan on May 8 for his “cell therapy treatment”.

He said the doctors attended to the cardinal’s health condition every day “but unfortunately everything they did doesn’t seem to be very effective”.

“He gradually became weaker and has lost most of his vitality. Sadly he passed away this morning” Leong said.

An engineering graduate at Dundee University in Scotland he worked in Brunei for seven years before starting his priestly studies.

Ordained in 1989 he became Brunei’s first local priest.

When St. John Paul II elevated Brunei to vicariate apostolic in 2004 he appointed Sim as its first bishop.

Pope Francis elevated him to the rank of cardinal at a consistory on Nov. 28 2020 along with Cardinal Jose Advincula of Capiz and 11 others.

Due to Covid-19 travel restrictions however Sim and Advincula were not not able to attend the ceremony at the Vatican.

On Dec. 16 2020 the pope named him member of the Vatican Congregation for the Clergy.

Leong said that funeral for the cardinal will be announced at a later date.

“Let us pray for his soul and for the vicariate. May his soul rest in peace” he said.

The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines also expressed sadness over the death of Cardinal Sim who visited the country in several occasions.

“I am deeply saddened by this news. Cardinal Sim was very close to the bishops of the Philippines” said Bishop Pablo Virgilio David CBCP Vice President.

Those who have cruised on the former Carnival cruise ship and follow the cruise line closely will be happy that the ship is not being scrapped and will remain in service in Asia.

Carnival Fascination Right Now

The Fantasy-class cruise ship is currently in China undergoing a refurbishment and cruisers will be happy to know she will continue service under her new owner of Century Cruises.

Carnival Fascination recently arrived at the Zhejiang Union Repair Shipbuilding facility which is located in Zhejiang Province. She is being refurbished as a luxury cruise vessel and is set to remain in operation. The cruise line has already been recruiting.

The Zhejiang facility is focusing on the luxury cruise market and in 2020 had complete the renovation of the Pacific World cruise ship formerly named Sun Princess.

The ship is now named Century Harmony as confirmed in December 2020 when the name was seen on the hull while making a port stop in Gibraltar. Before that she had been in a cold layup in Cadiz Spain during the suspension of operations.

Century Harmony formerly known as Carnival Fascination was sold due to the impact of the global pandemic. Four Fantasy-class vessels were sold and fortunately for Carnival Fascination she is the only one not sold for scrap.

Hosted by Silver Dollar Fair the attraction started Thursday and will finish Sunday night at the fairgrounds.

While not billed as the Silver Dollar Fair since the four-day event doesn’t have any large-scale concerts or exhibits many familiar attractions are still in tow.

Attractions over the first three days included a live shark encounter exhibit sprint car races and live performances from Creedence Clearwater Revival and Journey cover bands.

Fern Wright and her husband Terry of Yuba City happened upon the carnival and fair while looking for a Saturday outing.

“We just happened to pull it up” Fern Wright said. “I’m glad we did. I love the fair.”

Originally from Fresno the Wright’s said they’re no stranger to big fairs.

“Fresno has a huge fair. This is a perfect size” Wright said. “It’s something to do on a beautiful day before the heat comes tomorrow. It’s so nice to be able to finally get out.”

Wright’s husband Terry was looking forward to something else.

“He loves the food” Wright said. “Especially the corndogs.”

Saturday also saw the fair hosting the annual Junior Livestock Auction despite being closed to the public this year because of COVID-19.

Brenden Blake of Chico brought his family to the fair hoping to see farm animals.

“I just wanted to bring the kids out to the fair to see the livestock and check out the food” Blake said. “We drove by the other day and saw the Ferris wheel up so we kind of came on a whim. It’s nice after not having any sort of events last year to kind of be getting back to normal.”

In a noticeably packed and maskless crowd Blake said he was relieved his family had their COVID shots.

“We’re all vaccinated so we feel safe being here” Blake said. “We’re all just really excited and happy the fair is back.”

As for what Blake is most excited about at the carnival he said it was the sense of returning to normalcy that really stood out.

“It was a real bummer last year not having any community events going on” Blake said. “I’m just really excited to kind of be getting back. That’s the main thing.”

Notwithstanding changes in technology that make the environment more dangerous for carriers it is very likely that France will construct at least one replacement carrier thus maintaining her naval aviation tradition for another half-century.

France’s first carrier entered service in the interwar period but for a very long time the French navy trailed behind international counterparts in naval aviation. This changed in the Cold War however and today France operates the world’s most advanced carrier outside of the U.S. Navy. How did France build its naval aviation force what does it do today and what direction will France take next?

The History of French Carriers

Soon after World War I France joined the international carrier community through the conversion of the battleship hulk Bearn. Although large Bearn did not carry many aircraft and never actively participated in combat even during World War II. The construction of two additional large carriers was suspended by World War II but after the war the French navy gained access to light carriers transferred from Britain and the United States.

This first appeared earlier and is being reposted due to reader interest.

Four in total these carriers helped the French navy develop its naval aviation muscles. The next step was big; France constructed a pair of CATOBAR aircraft carriers Clemenceau and Foch. Commissioned in 1961 and 1963 the ships displaced 30000 tons and could carry around forty modern aircraft. A third carrier the much larger Verdun was cancelled before being laid down. Clemenceau and Foch operating the F-8 Crusader and later the Super Etendard would form the backbone of the world’s second largest carrier force for the latter half of the Cold War. After nearly forty years of hard service the two ships were decommissioned in favor of France’s next carrier the nuclear-powered Charles de Gaulle.

The Current State of French Naval Aviation

Charles de Gaulle (CdG) entered service in May 2001 after a troubled fifteen-year construction period. Displacing 42000 tons Charles de Gaulle can make twenty-seven knots and operates up to forty aircraft. She is the only carrier in the world outside of the U.S. Navy to use catapults to launch aircraft and consequently carries conventional CATOBAR-capable jets such as the Dassault Rafale and the E-2C Hawkeye. CdG is also the only nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to serve outside the U.S. Navy.

France also has a trio of assault carriers the Mistral-class ships Mistral Tonnerre and Dixmude. At 20000 tons the Mistrals can carry around thirty helicopters of various types. During operations off Libya the Mistrals were pushed into a strike role serving as platforms for attack helicopters conducting attacks against Libyan government positions.

Strategic Rationale

France’s carriers have contributed in a variety of ways to France’s strategic security vision. From the beginning the French navy appreciated that its carriers might play a role in high intensity combat against the Soviets and accordingly the carriers prepared for that mission. Clemenceau and Foch were equipped for nuclear deterrence as is Charles de Gaulle. But France also regarded itself as having responsibilities to its (soon to be former) empire and French carriers served in the Indochina War as well as the Suez Incident.

French carriers have made their greatest contribution over the past two decades in support of multilateral military operations. Clemenceau and Foch both participated in various operations in support of UN missions in Israel; Clemenceau supported coalition operations in the 1991 Gulf War while Foch operated in the Adriatic in support of UN and NATO ops in the former Yugoslavia. Charles de Gaulle has conducted repeated operations off Afghanistan since 2001 often filling in for U.S. carriers called to other duties. She served off Libya in 2011 and has conducted airstrikes against ISIS in Syria since 2015.

The Future for French Carriers

France cancelled a second carrier based on the design of the British Queen Elizabeth–class ships in 2013. France and the United Kingdom differed over propulsion and the French are unlikely in any case to have settled for a ski-jump carrier. However the cancellation of the second ship violates a cardinal rule of carrier acquisition as France is effectively without a significant proportion of its naval power every time CDG enters refit. Indeed at the moment the carrier has been in refit since February 2017.

Charles de Gaulle is expected to serve until 2040 and the French government has authorized studies on the construction of a replacement which could potentially overlap with CdG’s final years in service. Any future ship or ships would likely retain nuclear propulsion adopt the EMALS catapult system and operate conventional CATOBAR aircraft. Would France build two? The United Kingdom has done it and the French navy has often chafed at the capability hit it endures with Charles De Gaulle enters refit. But much depends on France’s financial and security situation in the late 2020s and early 2030s and these factors are extremely hard to predict. It is also unclear what sort of aircraft the next generation of French carriers will fly. By 2040 the Dassault Rafale will be quite old and the future of France’s “sixth generation” fighter project remains murky.

Conclusion

France’s experience with CdG demonstrates that for a country in France’s position one aircraft carrier can be made to work. Almost all of the significant military activities undertaken by France since 2001 (and indeed before) have come in the context of a multilateral cooperative effort with other major countries. This has meant that CdG can contribute and contribute effectively but that her periods of refit do not come at the expense of the coalition’s overall military power. Indeed even the Mistrals helped fill in during the Libya campaign taking up the slack left by CdG’s refit.

In any case it is unlikely that the French government will want to go without a naval aviation capability as CdG nears retirement. Charles de Gaulle has served effectively in keeping France a viable even necessary presence in the Western multilateral intervention scene. Notwithstanding changes in technology that make the environment more dangerous for carriers it is very likely that France will construct at least one replacement carrier thus maintaining her naval aviation tradition for another half-century.

Naval rivet counters military pundits and British jingos will be transfixed by this spectacular manifestation of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s ambitions of a post-Brexit “Global Britain” being a global player.

However while the force is deploying to Indo-Pacific there is no suggestion that it will take up station in the region.

This raises perhaps the biggest question over both the current mission and London’s wider strategic aims. Does the UK’s straitened defense establishment have the means to sustain London’s “tilt” toward the East? And would the British public support such an expensive and distant footprint?

Means vs dreams

Compared to the height of its Imperial power when Britannia’s bows ruled waves across the region its current military presence in East Asia is minimalist.

The biggest British force in the region is an infantry battalion and jungle warfare school in Brunei. Beyond that a 50-strong naval party is based at the Indian Ocean British territory of Diego Garcia which is leased to a much larger US force. And the Royal Navy’s British Defense Singapore Support Unit at Sembawang Singapore tasked with logistics and refueling has a similarly small level of personnel.

A scattering of British liaison officers are embedded around the region notably in South Korea with US Forces Korea and the UN Command and in the US at Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii.

“A few years ago a new Southeast Asia Staff was created in the British High Commission in Singapore – they have a colonel and a squadron leader and an NCO” said Alex Neill a British security consultant based in Singapore. “I think the Americans had a wry smile about the Brits puffing themselves up – ‘Three guys is a staff?’ But it is something.”

Compared to the mighty 375000-strong US Indo-Pacific Command which oversees a vast range of assets including the 7th Fleet a US Marine division in Okinawa and the 2nd US Infantry Division and 7th Air Force in Korea the Americans had a right to smile.

The command’s title may hark back to distant World War II and the Southeast Asia Command (SEAC). It may showcase British ignorance of the wider region: The more economically and strategically vital Northeast Asia comprising China Japan the Korean and the Russian Far East apparently does not figure.

This strategic myopia is reflected in how a budget-challenged Covid-hammered London is sending mixed signals about global commitment.

“’Global Britain’ is based on limited resources; we increased defense spend but cut the overseas development budget” said John Nilsson-Wright a Cambridge University academic and senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at think tank Chatham house. “That is a tangible example showing that the Johnson administration lacks real strategic depth in its thinking.”

He sniffed that Indo-Pacific occupies a grand total of two pages in the UK’s 2021 Integrated Review of Security Defence Development and Foreign Policy – and includes a typo.

Even so “a key thought line looking ahead is the challenge of China as a global player and how best to manage that” Nilsson-Wright noted. He asked “Where is our leverage?”

That question could be posed to the Admiralty. The Royal Navy with two new aircraft carriers on its order of battle – meaning usually one operational while the other rests and refits – has multiple commitments both within and beyond NATO: In home waters in the North Atlantic the Mediterranean and the Gulf.

It fields some big sexy assets including two F35 aircraft carriers four nuclear-missile submarines and three elite Royal Marine Commando battalions. But it is undermanned and deploys just 19 destroyers and frigates – the workhorses of any navy.

So can the UK sustain a presence in the Indo-Pacific?

“The UK ‘s military will be too stretched to operate in the Indo-Pacific” said retired Indian Vice Admiral Shekhar Sinha the founding partner of think tank Deepstrat. “It will not be sustainable for the UK.”

There have already been some embarrassing miscommunications.

“This has been a subject of discussion since the Ministry of Defence started messaging about heading out this way and The Times rather clumsily reported that a British aircraft carrier would be based in the Far East” said Neill. “People raised their eyebrows as there is no capability to do that.”

There are a handful of possibilities for UK defense planners. One option would be up-manning its Indian Ocean presence. “It may look at the option of using Diego Garcia either as a permanent post or staging post” suggested Sinha.

The facility at Sembawang Singapore is a far cry from the “Gibraltar of the East” that it once was. Even so “there has been talk of expanding the facility” said Neill who expects it to double in size and begin stockpiling gear.

Another alternative Neill noted would be to integrate with extant and extensive US basing in Japan. Tosh Minohara a Japan-US relations expert at Kobe University agrees.

“The UK should make a statement that is it a resident power as a maritime power” he suggested. “Maybe Japan could provide a base at Sasebo which is facing toward China.”

In terms of assets Asia Times has learned that the Royal Navy may station an offshore patrol vessel in the region. Crews will fly in and out from the UK enabling the vessel to remain on permanent regional patrol though it is unclear where – Diego Garcia? Singapore? Sasebo? – it might be based or even if it would have a base.

Still in a region prowled by Chinese carrier strike groups the sub-frigate-sized 2000-ton vessel may provide a presence but would not be a significant deterrent and would have limited defensibility. It would certainly not be symbolic of millennial Britannic might.

Even so cynics among the British chattering classes may be surprised to learn that their military – which has fought with considerable success in the region over two centuries against enemies ranging from Imperial Chinese and Japanese forces to North Korean soldiers and communist guerillas – engenders considerable respect.

“The UK still retains great international prestige in many nations because of the sacrifice that British people have made” said Chun In-bum a retired South Korean general. “With just a token commitment to the region they would bring prestige and stability.”

The British public focused on domestic concerns such as the economic challenges of Brexit and the possible breakup of the UK may evince little interest in the Indo-Pacific. However the British defense establishment gets it.

“Once a year I speak to the Royal College of Defense Studies and I see growing attention so from the military perspective the ‘tilt’ is good” said Chatham House’s Nilsson-Wright. “But there is a gap between military needs and public attitudes on the awareness of the importance of Britain being a player in the region.”

Regardless of an in-region footprint power is not static it is projectable hence London may not need to deploy a standing presence. Indeed Neill notes that the UK Ministry of Defense has used the adjective “episodic” regional deployments which does not nail down any particular time frame.

Seen in that light the CSG cruise looks set to prove – bar any unforeseen accidents – that the UK possesses power projection capabilities. And that is one of the two stated reasons for the deployment.

Why does London need an Indo-Pacific presence?

The other reason is to enforce a rules-based international order notably in terms of freedom of navigation operations or FONOPs thereby securing seaborne lines of communication and global trade.

But experts differ over FONOPs. After all South Korea whose economy is massively reliant upon exports and trade does not conduct them and Japan is a late and cautious player to the game.

Still Chun the ex-Korean general makes a sound case for FONOPs operations citing China’s “nine-dash line” under which it claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea and its potential anti-trade actions against any regional player with whom Beijing is displeased.

“If principle is not fought for then China could stop say any container ship and say ‘You are carrying stuff for Taiwan or for the Uighurs’” he said. “China has overstepped the mark and is paying for it in terms of its credibility.”

But others say the aim of FONOPs is unlinked to commerce.

“This narrative about the need to police international waters is a bit misleading – why on earth would China want to disrupt trade?” asked security analyst Neill. “It would not only be an act of economic suicide it would kill off all the regional economies.”

Seen in this critical light the real but unstated aim of FONOPs is not for the benefit of tankers bulk carriers and container ships but for warships.

“What is at the heart of the matter is the ability of the US Navy and its allies to navigate through the South China Sea and the East China Sea” stated Neill.

And firming up a relationship with its key ally is almost certainly a key driver behind London’s cruise.

“The problem for Johnson is that this image of ‘plucky Britain’ that informs his romantic political nostalgia is not matched by the UK’s declining political influence” said Nilsson-Wright.

With Johnson and his Conservatives having leveraged the UK away from its most influential post-war international grouping the EU upgrading London’s “special relationship” with Washington may well be sound politics. Not only does it grant London a seat at the table in Washington but it also de-risks adventures by having US personnel on deck.

Yet tying its defense future so closely to the US overlooks recent British history.

The UK’s most successful military adventures of the post-war era have arguably been carried out without US troops: The suppression of a communist insurgency in Malaysia in the 1950s “Konfrontasi” with Indonesia in the 1960s the “secret war” in Oman in the 1970s the Falklands War of the 1980s and the stabilization of Sierra Leone in the 1990s.

By contrast joint campaigns that the UK has joined with the US – notably in Korea Afghanistan and Iraq – had less successful outcomes. Still the UK is hardly the only Atlantic power that is tilting toward the Pacific.

“Five years ago when I lived in Europe the Europeans were way more disconnected from Asia than America was” said Daniel Pinkston a Seoul-based American scholar of international relations at Troy University. “Then they started getting burned and there was a rude awakening: They are no longer looking at China with rose-colored lenses.”

Washington’s Western allies pile east

The powerful US-led NATO alliance was traditionally postured against the Soviet Union and its successor state the Russian Federation. Even so the US successfully rallied “coalitions of the willing” to join its out-of-theater “Global War on Terror” in the Middle East.

With that messy struggle past its peak a larger more old-fashioned state-vs-state and system-vs-system confrontation is shaping up further east. As an ever-more-prosperous and powerful China flexes its muscles the US is digging deeper into the Indo-Pacific.

Though Washington has a loose network of alliances in the region no formal NATO-type multinational body exists.

The US leads the semi-official “Quad” grouping of Indo-Pacific allies – Australia India and Japan – that all have issues albeit at different levels of intensity with China. But as it stands at present that grouping is unofficial and lacks teeth: There is no mutual defense pact.

Washington also has bilateral defense treaties with Japan and South Korea two countries that boast mighty economies and powerful militaries.

However South Korea’s forces are largely postured toward North Korea and lack expeditionary focus. Japan’s forces notably its Maritime Self Defence Force have real punch but are constitutionally and politically restrained from trigger pulling.

Moreover due to endless disputes between Seoul and Tokyo over history and historiography Washington to its intense frustration has been unable to forge a trilateral alliance in the East China Sea/Sea of Japan.

And that is important territory covering China North Korea and the Russian Far East. Moreover a nascent Beijng-Moscow defense partnership is growing in the region.

Chinese forces joined Russia’s giant “Vostok” exercise in 2018 and have more recently conducted joint aerial drills with Russian warplanes – drills that exploited air gaps between Japan and South Korea.

For Washington China’s rise makes the Indo-Pacific the critical theater while its patchwork of partnerships makes it a complex alliance-scape. Other Western players are also recognizing the overall importance of the Indo-Pacific.

France is ahead of the UK. Paris which has two million French citizens in its Pacific territories deployed its own Charles de Gaulle carrier strike group to the region in 2019.

It is also deploying liaison officers on Australian warships in the region. This month its troops conducted joint exercises in Kyushu with the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force and US soldiers.

A Dutch frigate has joined the Queen Elizabeth CSG and a German vessel is set to deploy to the region in November-December. Moreover a number of Western navies including Canada’s have joined the US-led low-profile Proliferation Security Initiative which monitors North Korean shipping in the Western Pacific.

“The message is clear: it is not just the US that is challenging China it is in tandem with key allies” said Richard Heydarian who holds a geopolitics chair at the University of the Philippines. “We may see more of the French and Germans and other partners of the Quad – look at the cumulative effect.”

But even against this backdrop of increasing Western presence in the East Washington is likely to be pleased to see arguably its closest ally London staking a position in the region. After all Paris has always had a “one-step-removed” relationship to Washington while Berlin is hedging its bets: The German warship will be making a port call in Shanghai.

This could be why Washington has placed so many top-tier US assets – there are 10 US Marine F35s on the Queen Elizabeth’s deck and a US destroyer in her escort group – under British command.

But that is not just a political favor to a prized ally. Rather it ensures watertight interoperability in a region where the two navies have not fought alongside each other since the Korean War.

While the CSG’s eastward deployment has won massive press in the UK as marking a “new chapter” it actually has recent precedents. On the naval front Britain’s former flagship HMS Albion and two frigates have recently traversed the region.

On the army front British battlegroup headquarters had been quietly joining US and South Korean forces in their annual spring military drills up until 2018 when the drills were halted to “give space” for diplomacy with North Korea. And in 2019 British troops conducted exercises with Japan’s Ground Self Defense Force.

Such engagements – the CSG will be conducting a full gamut of joint drills on its eastward course – may grant post-Brexit UK increased international relevance.

The CSG deployment “is a positive development for the UK which has to figure out the costs of isolationism – the economic mess and disruption of Brexit” said Pinkston. “Re-engaging and participating in multilateral deployments is kind of the opposite development to Brexit.”

The ongoing regional pile on by the UK and other Western allies in the East is grist to the mill of the current US government.

The Donald Trump administration with its taste for unilateralism and ally-bashing is out of office replaced by Joe Biden’s team which has enthusiastically endorsed alliances. And diverging from the Atlanticist priorities of previous administrations Biden appears most heavily focused on the Indo-Pacific.

Not only was the first overseas visit by Biden’s secretaries of both state and defense to Tokyo and Seoul but the first two overseas leaders he received at the White House were Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.

In the ongoing Indo-Pacific battle for hegemony allies will not only shoulder a share of Washington’s military burden but they will also offer political backing in international fora. London is doing both.

The CSG is a formidable military burden share. As for international fora Johnson will be overseeing the G7 meeting in London in June which looks set to show a strong anti-China face. In addition to the G7 members Indo-Pacific democracies Australia India and South Korea will also be at the table leading some commentators to dub the meeting “The D10.”

But while the expansion of China-facing partnerships might please wonks in the US foreign policy establishment they might be less welcomed by hawks in the US defense establishment – for alliances constrain freedom of action.

“There are different implications: It is not just bringing more assets to the table with burden sharing” said Pinkston. “Multilateralism is a restraining mechanism on big powers that draws back radical or outlier policy positions. If you have a diverse group you bring other brains to the table.”

In a similar vein one expert hoped that the deployment’s eventual final destination Japan would not simply reinforce relations. By making explicit the value of alliances it could feasibly put a lid on unrealistic jingoism in both London and Tokyo – the capitals of two historically aggressive merchant-maritime powers that unleashed unilateralist colonial ventures.

“I am all for a sober UK that is realistic about its size place and influence in the world shedding the delusion that it is great” said Harukoh Sato a scholar at the Osaka School of International Public Policy “It might help Japan to also sober up and stop chasing the ghost of past ‘great power’ status.”

Sometimes there’s even slight indignation: how dare they “rest in peace” until the series is completed? But when I heard Eric Carle died this week at the age of 91 my reaction was simply joy and gratitude: for his life his work and especially for The Very Hungry Caterpillar.

The Very Hungry Caterpillar has sold more than 40 million copies in 60 languages.

Trained as a graphic designer and artist Carle had already co-published several other books by 1969 when The Very Hungry Caterpillar was released. That book took his career into another sphere. It’s been translated into at least 60 languages and sold between 40 to 60 million copies but it has been read and loved by at least 10 times that number with many more millions in the centuries to come.

The Very Hungry Caterpillar was revolutionary. Before The Very Hungry Caterpillar a children’s book was meant to be “respectable” with illustrations all impeccably drawn. Suddenly here was an author who splashed on gaudy colour and deliberately put holes in the pages just as if a caterpillar had chewed them. Carle put fun freedom and the right to be silly into picture books. He changed our concept of children’s literature forever.

Carle too was a technical and artistic revolutionary. He described himself as a “picture writer”. The image the adventure leap at you from the page. He used both text and colour to create his works mostly about animals or insects. The caterpillar was originally a bookworm but was changed on the advice of his editor (always take the advice of your editor). Possibly because his background was in design and advertising Carle’s work was gloriously minimalist. He used sheets of tissue paper all in bright primary colours in a form of collage that brought life and movement to the page.

“The monarch laid like 50 eggs so if we come back in a month...they will be everywhere” said Kristin Rossetti of the museum’s McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity. “We’re planting for pollinators and butterflies but we’re having the kids do it because it’s a great way for them to get their hands dirty and to have some real-life experience putting the plants in the ground. If they come to the Y they can watch the garden.”

Milkweed is the favorite of monarchs but many other types of native Florida plants were used including mimosa coreopsis firespike firebush and lantana.

The garden is in a corner of the property beside the athletic field.

Among the kids digging in was James Williams 8 who knows a thing or two about gardening and about butterflies.

“I love planting. It’s fun but seeds take a long time. If you plant it from a container and it grows — that is my forte. I’m great at it” James said. “Butterflies are pretty cool. I like watching it grow from a caterpillar. Then the butterfly lays eggs and the cycle starts all over again.”

The museum’s butterfly garden program has primarily worked with schools but is expanding to include community centers such as the North Central Florida YMCA.

In addition to providing a learning spot for youngsters the garden will double as a place for relaxation and a quiet break said Angela Howard YMCA president and CEO.

The Y and the museum partnered last year on a photography camp and the butterfly garden grew out of that.

“Anything we can give to children to learn something that they may not learn every day — that’s what we are here for. We want to open up doors of opportunity for children to learn” Howard said. “For us we can come out here and enjoy it and enjoy being out in nature.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaHJvbmljbGVvbmxpbmUuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9ob21lL2J1dHRlcmZseS1nYXJkZW5pbmctaW4tZmxvcmlkYS1hLWZldy1mYWN0cy9hcnRpY2xlXzY1MmM2YWVlLWJmNTktMTFlYi1hY2FlLTIzOWQzNGUyYTU0My5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Butterfly gardening in Florida — a few facts | Home and Outdoor Living | chronicleonline.com,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

The property at 1967 Lawrence Ave E. which sits at a corner in Wexford has just gone up for sale.

According to CBRE Limited the company listing the property the plaza is home to five units.

Its most active unit right now is Ibrahim BBQ the longtime restaurant that's been serving 2-for-1 shawarmas until 5 a.m. for years. It's unclear whether the other businesses including a travel agency and a foreign exchange centre are operating during lockdown.

Also uncertain is whether Ibrahim BBQ will be retained once new owners take over. The owners of the restaurant could not be reached for comment at time of publishing.

The remainder of the 5589-square-foot plaza boasts a dental facility for any dentists interested in buying. The clinic comes with 3 fully plumbed operatories a reception desk and waiting area sterilization room and lab room.

If new owners don't plan on operating a dental practice there's also the option of razing the plaza and turning it into some kind of mid-rise as many property owners are prone to doing.

According to the listing the plot of land is actually zoned for a building anywhere between six to eight storeys.

CBRE representative Danny Shvartsman couldn't be reached for comment regarding the potential future of the plaza.

Ibrahim BBQ and its iconic Best In Town 2 for 1 Shawarma sign and outdoor seating has anchored this strip of good eats for years so hopefully the plans include this Wexford staple.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Those who attended this year’s 75th anniversary of the event were looking to let a year of pent-up emotions loose in celebration of native son Jordan Spieth who grew up less than an hour from Colonial Country Club.

The story was all but written on Saturday — Spieth held a one-stroke edge after 54 holes and aside from one single competitor it looked like he couldn’t be caught.

But somebody forgot to hand Jason Kokrak the script.

The jovial Ohioan got a little riled early but then bounced back and put on an impressive display of big drives solid putting and resilience grabbing his second PGA Tour title by finishing at 14 under for the four-round event. Spieth was second at 12 under.

Kokrak — a Xavier University product who calls the Cleveland suburb of Hudson Ohio his hometown — took the lead on the front nine while Spieth struggled through the three-hole Horrible Horseshoe a tricky area that circles the driving range. Spieth made bogey on two of three while Kokrak dropped a curling 23-foot putt on No. 5 to jump in front.

But it looked like the wheels might fall off for Kokrak on No. 7 when he needed two tries to get out of a greenside bunker then angrily heaved his ball into nearby trees — perhaps sensing he’d missed an opportunity while Spieth was misfiring. Instead Kokrak settled down got back on top with a birdie on No. 11 — one of only two par 5s at Colonial — and watched as Spieth made par.

Kokrak posted bogeys on both Nos. 15 and 16 giving Spieth life as the lead was cut to one but he made a huge 7-foot putt on No. 17 to maintain the lead. On 18 Spieth found the water with his second shot taking the pressure off the two-time Ohio Amateur champion who two-putted his way to victory.

Kokrak noticed the pro-Spieth crowd but he tried to simply maintain his focus.

“I don’t know if it motivated me or not but I told myself like the last time I would be just stay patient one shot at a time” Kokrak said. “That sounds like everybody else but you know you can’t get ahead of yourself in this game. This game doesn’t owe you anything and you know you take each shot for what it is whether you make a bogey or a par or a birdie.

“Each hole is an individual match against yourself and Jordan was there the whole day. He was up a couple down a couple and I made my mistakes. He made his mistakes. I tried to stay patient.”

Kokrak has been better than ever on the greens since caddie David Robinson suggested a move to a longer putter one with a 36-inch shaft and the results have been astounding. He picked up his first PGA Tour win last October at the CJ Cup in Las Vegas and has only continued to gain steam earning five top-25 finishes in his last eight starts before coming to Colonial.

He’s jumped to seventh on the Tour in Strokes Gained: Putting this season. He was 10th in the field in that stat this week to go with No. 1 in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee.

After starting his PGA Tour career without a win in 230 starts he’s since won twice in his last 17 events and is now one of a trio of two-time winners on Tour this season joining Bryson DeChambeau and Stewart Cink.

Meanwhile despite falling Spieth is still enjoying a renaissance of sorts. During a stretch of four Texas PGA Tour events in nine weeks Spieth has all top-10 finishes — including a victory at the Valero Texas Open.

Still he wasn’t thrilled to fall apart the way he did on Sunday especially in front of adoring fans.

“I didn’t play well at all quite simply” Spieth said. “I could have shot even par today and won the golf tournament but from the very get-go just a really bad start and then tried to fight my way through it. But I was just really off with my golf swing. I really lost it this weekend. You just have to be in control around Colonial.

“I just really just didn’t play well. That’s all it was. I played a bad round of golf.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwMDA0MjkxLWNoYXJsZXMtc2Nod2FiLWNoYWxsZW5nZS0yMDIxLWphc29uLWtva3Jhay1lZGdlcy1wYXN0LWpvcmRhbi1zcGlldGgtZm9yLXdpbtIBiAFodHRwczovL3N5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmJsZWFjaGVycmVwb3J0LmNvbS9hbXAvMTAwMDQyOTEtY2hhcmxlcy1zY2h3YWItY2hhbGxlbmdlLTIwMjEtamFzb24ta29rcmFrLWVkZ2VzLXBhc3Qtam9yZGFuLXNwaWV0aC1mb3Itd2luLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Charles Schwab Challenge 2021: Jason Kokrak Edges Past Jordan Spieth for Win,"Tom Pennington/Getty Images

Jason Kokrak won his second event this season claiming the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth Texas on Sunday after Jordan Spieth's tough afternoon.

Kokrak shot an even-par 70 in the final round to finish -14 for the tournament two strokes ahead of Spieth who led after the third round but shot a three-over 73 on Sunday.

Charley Hoffman Patton Kizzire Sebastian Munoz and Ian Poulter rounded out the top five all tied at 10 under.

Kokrak was hardly spectacular on the day finishing with five birdies and five bogeys. He averaged 319.6 yards of driving distance had a 78.5 percent driving accuracy hit 66.6 percent of greens in regulation and gained 0.967 strokes putting per PGATour.com.

But he was good enough to topple Spieth who offset two birdies with five bogeys. Spieth went into the final hole just a stroke down but his chances to catch Koprak were sunk when his approach rolled its way into the water.

Kokrak came into the final round knowing that playing in a group with Spieth—one of the PGA Tour's most popular players and a Dallas native—would make him Sunday's antagonist for more than a few golf fans.

“He’s a Texas guy. I’m an Ohio guy. It’s fun"" he told reporters after Saturday's third round. ""The crowds are crazy. But it’s fun to have a local kid and play well and him be in the last group and I’d be more than happy to spoil it for him tomorrow.”

Spoil it he did."

This chain is the top choice quick-service restaurant for plant-based and vegan consumers nationwide. With 2500 locations across the United States Chipotle is an easily accessible option for anyone who wants to avoid animal products and still have a delicious Mexican meal. Basically any options for the meat-eating customer is available for plant-based consumer just hold the meat and add beans peppers or whatever you want.

Whether you're ordering a burrito tacos a salad or a burrito bowl the restaurant offers enough vegan options to create a delicious and filling wrap. Chipotle only uses 53 ingredients totally in all its food 44 of them being vegan. This makes it unbelievably easy to leave Chipotle with a satisfying plant-based meal plus meat-free orders usually come with free guac and ring in at a far lower price!

Chipotle’s immense range of vegan options makes this an absolute favorite for any plant-based eater. The company caters so heavily towards plant-forward meals that you do not even need to be vegan to enjoy a completely plant-based meal. The only nine ingredients to watch out for when ordering include Monterey Jack cheese beef cheese cultures honey milk pork white cheddar cultured cream and chicken. Aside from those the meal you walk out with is guaranteed to be vegan.

Meals

Burrito: The Chiptole Burrito is the heaviest and the greatest option on the menu. The soft warmed flour tortilla can be filled with any number of ingredients making it one of the most filling quick-vegan meals on the market. One of the greatest things about Chipotle is that it serves tofu sofritas setting the company above its competitors. The restaurant chain offers black beans alongside tofu as a protein substitute but Chipotle is the only quick-service Mexican-inspired restaurant to provide customers with tofu sofritas for their burritos. From guacamole to cilantro rice the Chipotle burrito holds all the flavor you can ask for and more.

Tacos: The three taco meal is the less conventional option at Chipotle but it hits all the marks necessary to leave more than satisfied. The tacos come packed into soft flour tortillas or crispy corn taco shells. You can customize your tacos to include any of the vegan fillings. The best part is that the three tacos do not need to hold the same contents making customization a key drawing factor for the three taco meals. Our suggestion is to take one taco for tofu one for black beans and one for pinto beans and then topped to preference.

Burrito Bowls: The only meal more filling than the burrito is Chipotle’s burrito bowl. Even though this option nixes the tortilla it's possible to make two full meals out of the burrito bowl. Typically served with a rice base you can order any of the vegan ingredients to cover the burrito bowl. The lower-carb option is definitely for those who want to either save leftovers easier or would rather sit down and eat unrushed with a fork.

Pro Tip: Order a tortilla (or two) on the side to get even more mileage out of your bowl.

Salads: For the healthiest option Chipotle’s salads are a perfect choice. The salad comes served on romaine lettuce thatcher than the burrito bowl’s rice base. The salad is an easy healthy low-carb option that will still give any customer the full Chipotle experience. You can order any of the normal ingredients on top of your salad including the sofritas tofu and fajita veggies to get the full burrito experience without as much of the heaviness. Chipotle also introduced a “Supergreens Lettuce Blend” in 2020 that contains kale and baby spinach to enhance the nutritional value of the salad. The nutrient-rich blend can be requested to replace the romaine lettuce on any salad order giving even more diversity to the Chipotle menu. Take note that Chipotle's vinegarette contains honey so opt for the hot sauce instead if you're vegan.

Fajita Veggies and Black Beans: If you aren't a fan of tofu the best burrito or burrito bowl base is the black beans and the fajita vegetables. The mix of carmelized red onions and assorted bell peppers make for a delicious nutrient-filled addition to any meal. Seasoned with oregano it adds a sweet and savory twist to the mixture of burrito ingredients. When accompanied with the black beans the meal itself becomes packed with protein.

Tizoc Zarate says his restaurant job did not pay enough during the pandemic for him and his girlfriend to put food on the table

WASHINGTON - As the number of Covid-19 cases soared in Washington through the fall and winter Tizoc Zarate waited tables at a local restaurant -- but struggled to put enough food on the table for himself and his girlfriend.

Zarate 22 says he is angry about the health risks he faced especially given the low pay -- and the lack of support from his bosses.

""I felt as if I couldn't say anything to management"" Zarate told AFP adding that at the time he and his co-workers felt lucky to be working at all.

The Mexican-American server is not alone -- hundreds of restaurant workers and activists protested this week at lunch-hour ""wage strikes"" across the United States demanding an end to what they say is unacceptable pay for tipped workers.

In the United States restaurant and other service industry employees who earn more than a certain amount per month in tips can be paid far less than the standard minimum wage.

With the number of diners vastly reduced due to coronavirus-related restrictions in most US cities those workers saw their take-home salary plummet.

""During the pandemic tips were down 60-70 percent and there were increased incidents of customer hostility and aggression"" says Yamila Ruiz the communications director for One Fair Wage which organized the protests.

""We've been holding strikes since last summer.""

In Washington the ""wage strike"" -- staged by a handful of industry workers -- took place Wednesday outside the Old Ebbitt Grill a historic bar and restaurant not far from the White House that is popular both with politicians and tourists.

""Low wages stop America's recovery"" read one sign.

- Covid-related stress on the job -

Over the course of the pandemic more than 2.5 million restaurant jobs were lost in the United States according to the National Restaurant Association and over 110000 restaurants were closed.

But now some restaurants have said they are struggling to fill positions as businesses gradually reopen across the country and activists say low wages are to blame.

""In January eight percent of restaurant operators rated recruitment and retention of workforce as their top challenge"" National Restaurant Association Senior Vice President Hudson Riehle said.

""By April that number had risen to 57 percent.""

The One Fair Wage organization surveyed restaurant workers and found that more than half reported they were considering leaving their job due to low wages.

The second most popular reason? Covid-related health risks.

Zarate said during his drive home from his shift he would agonize over whether he had been infected -- or if somehow he had unwittingly infected someone else.

""Probably half of the people were not wearing masks when I would come (to the table) some were not following the rule about the number of people at the table and management would overlook things like that"" he said.

When Washington imposed tighter dining restrictions in December the restaurant where he worked closed and Zarate was laid off.

- 'Wage shortage' -

In a bid to attract employees McDonald's US restaurants and Chipotle Mexican Grill this month announced plans to raise wages though McDonald's wage increase will not pertain to franchises.

""All restaurant sales are local"" Riehle said. ""So in the end local market forces will impact not only the increase in needed workforce but also the particular incentives needed to recruit those employees.""

Republican critics including South Carolina congresswoman Nancy Mace blame a lack of workers in certain sectors on a supplemental US unemployment benefit of $300 a week enacted as part of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion relief package.

Ruiz said this particular argument drove One Fair Wage to renew its protests.

""It's a wage shortage not a worker shortage"" Ruiz said refuting the idea that restaurant workers are sitting idle during pandemic layoffs by noting that many found other work.

After spending months trying -- and failing -- to figure out how to get unemployment benefits Zarate finally found a new job at a pre-school.

Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Chicago has been around for 125 years and acted as the primary church for three surrounding neighborhoods of Ashland Avenue.

The church held its first mass in October 1892 and was physically moved in 1929.

It took the efforts of 50 men and their horses to pry the 10000 ton church from its foundation move it across the street and rotate it 90 degrees. According to a Chicago Ancestry site the church was moved at a 'foot a minute.'

'It is a magnificent historically and architecturally significant church' said church preservation advocate Julie Sawacki on the steps leading to the church's entrance. 'Imagine tearing something so significant down.'

The church in its present form was built in 1916 and moved across a street by 50 men and horses in 1929

The Archdiocese of Chicago told CBS News that attendance at the church's Sunday masses have steadily declined.

The church simultaneously needs $2 million worth of repairs and without the community's support its likely it will be demolished.

There are a group of parishioners including Hilda Correa who are desperately trying to save the famed religious landmark. Correa and others say the church attracts tourists both Christian and non-Christian.

Correa also alluded to the fact that times are hard. Although she didn't specify what she was talking about - perhaps the years-long pandemic or stubborn inflation - Correa says the church is a place of comfort for those who come to visit.

Hilda Correa left and Julie Sawacki right as well as a number of others passionate about keeping Our Lady of Lourdes alive made impassioned pleas on the steps of the church before its last service on May 19

'The religious aspect is really what's really touching us because losing such a valuable place that people can come especially in these days...'

Our Lady of Lourdes will be holding its final service on May 19 but Preservation Chicago a non-profit organization dedicated to saving city landmarks plans to revive the church and make it into a holy shrine.

'The effort here will probably be long and labored perhaps. There's a lot of different moving parts and a lot of different factors' said Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller.

There is a Change.org petition with 1107 signatures to preserve the church as a historical landmark rather than knocking it down. The goal is to reach 1500 signatures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsdHJpYi5jb20vcmVsaWdpb24vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9sZHMtd29tZW4tY2h1cmNoLWxlYWRlcnMtd2hlbi1kaWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LDS women push back — again — against an address delivered by a Relief Society leader,"(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints explained that even though she worked outside the home her priority has always been motherhood.

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

That means I have to resort to using the same ones over and over and over again as the Cincinnati Reds continue their slide back to futility from last year’s pit-stop at mediocrity.

Today the Reds fell as flat as possible against the Chicago Cubs. Miscast defenders made costly mistakes and the pitching never once bailed them out. Luis Castillo resident ‘ace’ of the staff again was hounded for runs by the opposition unable to break the funk that permeates this roster in a big spot. The arms walked runners on walked runners in and the arms being counted on heavily despite having been cast aside by every other franchise mostly did what arms that are cast aside by every other franchise do: they showed why that was the case.

This is 50 games into the season. Last season was only 60 games altogether. With an ownership group that has repeatedly shown its hand as being both penny-pinching and prioritizing profits over wins you have to wonder how much worse 22-28 in the standings has to get before they begin to cut more costs and run again. Days like today go a long way towards making shareholders that are in it for the money - and not in it to win it - beg to stop the financial bleeding.

Chicago scored 10 runs Cincinnati scored just 2 and here we are again as June looms.

Kwitang pada zaman dulu juga dikenal sebagai salah satu tempat ahli pencak silat akibat akulturasi silat betawi dan silat Cina (Kuntao).

Tak sebatas itu di kampung ini juga dilahirkan jagoan pencak silat yaitu H Muhammad Djaelani atau yang kerap dipanggil dengan sebutan Mad.

Nama Kwitang sendiri didapat dari seorang pengembara asal Cina yang datang ke Batavia pada abad ke-17 bernama Kwee Tang Kiam yang juga seorang tuan tanah karena kepandaiannya dalam berdagang yang kemudia masyarakat sekitar (orang-orang Betawi) memanggilnya dengan sebutan Kwitang.

Kwee Tang Kiam memiliki seorang anak yang gemar berjudi.

Hingga suatu ketika Kwee Tang Kiam meninggal semua tanah yang dimilikinya terjual dan di beli oleh orang-orang keturunan Arab.

Lama kelamaan kejayaan dari Kwee Tang Kiam ini meredup akibat ulah sang anak yang gemar berjudi.

Kemudian ia menjual tanah tersebut ke orang-orang keturunan arab yang tinggal di situ.

Orang keturunan Arab ini kemudian membangun masjid Kwitang yang diresmikan oleh presiden Soekarno. pada tahun 1963. Masjid ini berkembang menjadi lebih besar.

Both took different paths in this evolution experiencing success along the way. Compelling reasons exist to invest in each but is there a clear winner between the two?

Let's evaluate these tech titans to understand why one emerges as the better investment at this time.

Cisco's path forward

As part of its evolution in the era of cloud computing Cisco built up a suite of software products to reduce reliance on its computer networking hardware business. This proved a prescient move in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

Last year Cisco contended with supply chain challenges created by the pandemic. This constraint caused year-over-year revenue to drop by 5% in its 2020 fiscal year which ended July 25. The pandemic could have hurt revenue further if not for Cisco's software business. Its cybersecurity offerings saw fiscal 2020 revenue grow 12% year over year.

Cisco also invested in technology to support a slew of new growth opportunities. These include capabilities for 5G networks the Internet of Things and 400G which involves next-gen technology to address bandwidth demands and other technical challenges related to cloud computing.

These investments are paying off particularly as the pandemic's end draws closer in the United States. Revenue returned to an upward trajectory in Cisco's fiscal third quarter ended May 1 increasing 7% year over year to $12.8 billion.

That's just the start of its success. Cisco experienced 10% growth in third-quarter product orders. This was the strongest demand Cisco has seen since the 2012 fiscal year.

Cisco is not only relying on the latest technology trends to power revenue growth. The company moved its software products to a software-as-a-service subscription model which gives Cisco a reliable recurring revenue stream. Cisco has successfully navigated this transition. Its Q3 subscription revenue comprised 81% of software sales up from 76% the previous quarter.

The company is also bundling its products. This is a smart move. Any client purchasing networking hardware will also need Cisco's security solutions to protect from criminals hacking that network. Security is essential in the IT industry so it's no surprise Cisco saw Q3 revenue for its security products increase 13% year over year.

As the pandemic's impact recedes Cisco sees its business returning to revenue growth. The company expects fourth-quarter revenue to rise at least 6% year over year.

IBM's evolution

IBM is navigating its own challenges aside from the coronavirus pandemic. Big Blue is in the midst of a multi-year transformation. Its business suffered years of revenue declines as clients moved away from its on-premises technology offerings to cloud computing.

IBM has existed for over a century so it's well versed in adapting to the technology industry's changes. The company shifted its focus to cloud computing in recent years and these efforts have proven successful. IBM grew cloud-based income from just 4% of total revenue in 2013 to 34% in 2020.

IBM's cloud efforts led to total cloud revenue of $6.5 billion in the first quarter of this year a 21% year-over-year increase. Yet some of its legacy businesses weighed on IBM's cloud success.

The company's global technology services segment which helps clients implement IBM's solutions saw year-over-year revenue drop 1.5%. This division represents more than a third of IBM's total revenue bringing in $6.4 billion of Q1's $17.7 billion.

As part of IBM's strategy to focus on its cloud computing and artificial intelligence strengths it plans to spin off a portion of the operations under its global technology services division into a new company called Kyndryl. Kyndryl will help clients modernize IT infrastructures serving as a partner to IBM's offerings. The spinoff will happen by the end of this year.

The verdict

IBM's cloud success is appealing and once it separates out Kyndryl Big Blue's cloud business will benefit without Kyndryl's drag on earnings. But the value of owning shares in Kyndryl is murky. That's why I think it's best to wait on IBM shares until the Kyndryl spinoff. That way you can effectively evaluate whether you want to own a piece of this new company.

Meanwhile Cisco remains a market leader in its core networking business. Its Q3 results show the company is on an upward trajectory as the pandemic's impact starts to fade. Its investments in up-and-coming trends such as 5G provide years of revenue growth opportunity. These factors make Cisco the better investment right now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vZmxhc2gtc2Vhc29uLTctZXBpc29kZS0xMi10cmFpbGVyLWNpc2NvLWV4aXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Flash Season 7 Trailer Teases Cisco's Emotional Goodbye Episode,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vZmxhc2gtc2Vhc29uLTctZXBpc29kZS0xMi10cmFpbGVyLWNpc2NvLWV4aXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWF1cmV2aWV3LmNvbS9tdXNpYy9waG90by1nYWxsZXJ5LXNhbi1jaXNjby1qYWd1YXItam9uemUtZW5tb3JlLXRoZWF0cmUtMjgtMDUtMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photo Gallery: San Cisco + Jaguar Jonze - Enmore Theatre (28.05.21),"San Cisco came to Sydney-town last night as part of their Between You and Me tour.

What will be the demands on and future objectives of government? That was the focus of the first debate with Francis Fukuyama Stanford University; Molly Morgan Jones The British Academy; and Ranjitsinh Disale Global Teacher Prize Winner. Melinda Crane moderated the discussion.

The global pandemic highlighted how government decisions and actions are critical to people’s lives and livelihoods. Understanding what people want from their leaders is essential. Ranjitsinh Disale posited that whilst health is currently everyone’s primary concern citizens are unsure how long online learning will continue and how governments can address the stark differences in learning opportunities that have been exacerbated by the pandemic. Molly Morgan Jones underlined that citizens’ demands are fluid right now especially that many countries are mid-COVID crisis at best and for many it is very much on-going. But one thing is certain: people are asking more from their governments.

It is less clear whether citizens are aware of the need to address the trade-offs required with competing objectives and limited public finances. For example people’s livelihoods today versus the future viability of natural assets and biodiversity or today’s social welfare and insurance schemes versus tomorrow’s need to pay back government debts. There are also competing short term needs – opening up the economy versus controlling the spread of the pandemic and keeping children in school versus shielding the elderly from exposure to the pandemic which are real challenges for today’s government leaders.

Citizens' demands and expectations are rising fast and outstripping government capability to respond. What can be done to better align government response capabilities with citizen expectations? Francis Fukuyama aptly pointed out that the expectations of governments have been rising faster than their ability to provide services and people’s expectations are not stable and consistent.

When governments don’t meet expectations trust is undermined and eroded. Globally the COVID-19 pandemic has focused people’s attention on the question of trust and unsurprisingly the debate presented several conundrums:

Transparency without accountability : As governments respond to demands communication must be done openly and transparently to support trust Molly Jones argues. Yet when transparency exists without accountability to back it up people become more cynical more frustrated.

: As governments respond to demands communication must be done openly and transparently to support trust Molly Jones argues. Yet when transparency exists without accountability to back it up people become more cynical more frustrated. Too much transparency? The Internet now brings too much information from too many sources said Francis Fukuyama. Governments have a role to play especially during a crisis in harnessing technology in a way that is good for citizens and being the honest broker in what information is actually relevant.

The Internet now brings too much information from too many sources said Francis Fukuyama. Governments have a role to play especially during a crisis in harnessing technology in a way that is good for citizens and being the honest broker in what information is actually relevant. It’s the messenger not the message; participation not the product. Fukuyama also pointed out that the problem has become the messenger rather than the message. People simply do not trust certain institutions for example public health institutions which have given perceived or actual conflicting information or guidance on the pandemic.

Fukuyama also pointed out that the problem has become the messenger rather than the message. People simply do not trust certain institutions for example public health institutions which have given perceived or actual conflicting information or guidance on the pandemic. Expectations are focused nationally yet delivery is local. Morgan-Jones pointed out that local level structures are crucial for delivering services. There is a need to marry top-down support with investments in lower-level expertise. Trust in local institutions can counterbalance any lack thereof or frustration with national institutions.

20th century methods versus 21st century reality. Many questions were raised regarding the place and pace of technology. Prioritizing digital infrastructure for critical services is crucial. Yet large disparities exist in digital access. Ranjitsinh Disale emphasized that virtual and distance teaching can allow millions more to teach and learn; he argues internet access should be understood as a basic right of all students indeed all citizens.

I knew I was fortunate to be able to stay home but the solitude felt uncomfortable like shoes that pinched. As we watched our way through “Gilmore Girls” my partner and I spoke often of everything we would embrace when (if) there was a vaccine: dinner out dance parties with friends anything and everything that didn’t involve our couch.

In the early weeks of the pandemic Samantha Heintzelman an assistant professor of psychology at Rutgers University-Newark noticed that people were more interested in her research than usual. It made sense: Heintzelman studies routines which were disappearing faster than Clorox wipes. “A mass disruption” Heintzelman calls it one that had people walking around the block as a fake commute or filling their schedules with Duolingo lessons and home improvement projects.

Yet now vaccine complete I’m strangely protective of my boring little routine. A friend texted. She was in the neighborhood and did I want to get a drink? I didn’t. I wanted to pour a glass of wine and read my book and see her in a few days with ample time to prepare.

Heintzelman’s research — which involves among other things asking subjects to rate themselves using a metric called the Disliking Disruption scale — helps explain my reaction. We use routines Heintzelman says “to make sense of the world and our place in it.” And when our lives make sense to us we are able to see the meaning in them.

It’s only natural that as we emerge from our COVID-era cocoons then we might cling to the routines — however mundane — we established in a bid to give our lives structure and thus meaning. But the idea isn’t that we all should be living out some version of “Groundhog Day.” “We need to have some flexibility around our routines” Heintzelman says. “We need novelty to learn and to grow.” Being married to a routine leaves us feeling stuck stifled and distressed. If you’ve ever called someone “set in their ways” you probably didn’t mean it as a compliment.

For me this means that after a year that rewarded boundaries and fostered routine I need to retrain my brain to embrace social calls and spontaneity.

Of course if brain training were easy we would keep every New Year’s resolution. But we have less control over our behavior than we think says Wendy Wood provost professor of psychology and business at the University of Southern California. Wood studies routine’s cousin the habit.

“Context is really important” she says. Our surroundings “encourage us to repeat certain behaviors. That’s one reason why people who live near parks get more exercise. It’s not that they have more willpower than everybody else or they’re more health conscious. It’s that they just have more opportunities.”

Over the last year “we have all formed habits to work at home eat at home entertain ourselves at home” she says. “You have a habit to stay home and you’re having to override it because everything that activated that habit is still there. Your kitchen is still there. Your Netflix is still there.” When my context starts to change — when I go back to interviewing story subjects in person when I return to the gym instead of wedging a yoga mat between the couch and TV — my social routine may naturally morph back to what it was before the pandemic.

Habits and routines often encompass a series of choices we don’t realize we’re making. Seasoned runners no longer think about what time to wake up what to wear or what route to take; they just do it to coin a phrase. In contrast someone trying to add a morning jog to their routine feels the weight of all of those decisions. Wood writes about this in her 2019 book “Good Habits Bad Habits: The Science of Making Positive Changes That Stick.” Until you’ve done something enough that you’re operating on autopilot each step is a potential exit point.

The jogging analogue for me is all of the small trivial steps between an impromptu invitation to meet a friend and actually meeting the friend. Choices such as where to meet how to get there and whether I need to change out of my stretchy pants are minor but cumulative weighing on me because they’re not automatic.

There’s also the concept of identity consistency Heintzelman says. The longer someone follows a routine the more it becomes part of their sense of self: I am a person who does this. Part of my resistance to an unplanned outing may be less about disliking disruption and more about wearing an identity many of us have taken on: that of a person who keeps myself and others safe by mostly staying home and always planning ahead. “It’s hard to change those thought patterns” Heintzelman says.

This may be especially true considering the anxiety uncertainty and loss of control that has flattened us these last 15 months. You don’t just pop up after you’ve been hit by a steamroller.

“This was over a year of severe fear” says Karol Darsa a psychologist who founded and runs Reconnect a trauma treatment center in Los Angeles. “The more unpredictable outside life is the more predictability and control we need.” A routine can help us feel like we have control and it’s OK if we’re not ready to give that up. “We were facing death of ourselves or of our loved ones. It’s not possible to act like nothing happened” she says. “If we accept that we might have an easier time with it.”

Darsa suggests starting with “planned spontaneity”: picking a night in advance to break from my routine but not choosing the activity until that night. “So there’s a little bit of control” she says. “You can build on that.”

As we all navigate this transition period it’s important to be open with friends and family about our feelings Darsa says. “Maybe just say to someone ‘You know I’m really trying to be more spontaneous but I’m noticing some resistance to it’” she says. “When you are honest and vulnerable in that way it allows other people to be honest as well.’”

This year was different.

CONCORD N.C. — Drivers took hundreds of left turns on the tracks but the in-person event turned things around for areas businesses and vendors who longed to see customers back at the Coca-Cola 600.

Sunday's race was given the green flag with no restrictions allowing more than 50000 fans to pack in the speedway to cheer on drivers.

""It's good to be back to being normal"" said Hill McCraw a fan who attended the race for the first time in eight years. ""We are super excited to be back out and experiencing the race.""

He and thousands of other NASCAR fans raced to the tracks on a cooler than usual race day and their wallets were ready.

""Man what more could you ask for with all these people"" said Doc Doby ecstatically smiling at the lines of customers in front of his merchandise trailer.

Doby sells merchandise to fans year after year except for last year when business took a pandemic pummel.

""Oh yeah definitely yeah"" quickly answered.

He was able to sell at a few races last year that were in-person but had very few fans but he's glad restrictions are over and his customers are back in full force.

""Y'all enjoy the race"" he told customers in an upbeat mood with a big smile across his face.

Dana Wyatt a vendor parked across the street was excited to have fans back as well.

""It's a big boost! It's good"" she said.

Customers were lined up in troves for her vending trailer leaving with bags of merchandise like hats and shirts among other items.

""As you see our walls are empty"" she said as the race started after fans went inside the speedway gates.

Charlotte Motor Speedway brings in an estimated $450 million to the regional economy in a normal year according to its website. In 2020 millions were lost but with fans at this year's race businesses are relieved.

""It's been beyond impressive with everyone it's been overwhelming really"" Wyatt added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYXJsb3R0ZW9ic2VydmVyLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvbmFzY2FyLWF1dG8tcmFjaW5nL2FydGljbGUyNTE3OTQ0MzguaHRtbNIBUWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNoYXJsb3R0ZW9ic2VydmVyLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvbmFzY2FyLWF1dG8tcmFjaW5nL2FydGljbGUyNTE3OTQ0MzguaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coke 600 race analysis and results: All of NASCAR is chasing Kyle Larson and Hendrick,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.charlotteobserver.com', port=443): Read timed out.

And in doing so he has put Hendrick Motorsports in a category all their own in the annals of NASCAR history.

Kyle Larson dominated the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway leading 327 of 400 laps to score his second win of the season. Larson's win marks the 269th in the history of Hendrick Motorsports which makes them the all-time winningest race team in the history of the NASCAR Cup Series surpassing Petty Enterprises.

Chase Elliott finished second with Kyle Busch's third-place run breaking up four Hendrick cars in the Top 5: William Byron ran fourth Alex Bowman fifth followed by Austin Dillon Denny Hamlin Chris Buescher Tyler Reddick and Kevin Harvick.

""It was not easy. I feel like I had to fight off William and Chase a lot"" Larson told Fox Sports. ""It kind of worked out there that last run: The 43 (Erik Jones) had to pit and pulled out in front of me I just towed with him for awhile and stretched my lead out. We had a good car there that last run. Feels great to be the guy to help Mr. H break that record finally.""

Starting from the pole Larson held command of the lead for most of the race with only Chase Elliott and William Byron offering him serious challenges. The longest race on the Cup calendar was made more challenging by a relatively quick pace as the race featured multiple long green flag runs and little attrition.

Aside from the four stage breaks only two cautions were the result of trouble on the track: Kurt Busch had engine troubles near the halfway point while Ryan Newman had the only on-track accident of the day after suffering a tire failure.

With 15 races now in the books Kyle Larson is only the third driver this season win more than one win.

""Being everything we thought it would be I think the atmosphere was incredible. I think our performance was pretty good and I think it's a great stepping-stone for us to continue to build on for this series and hopefully moving forward.

For Turnbull the win came as a result of weeks of regular season preparation adding that the team was ""proud"" of its execution throughout their first playoff game.

""The whole season we’ve been building and building waiting to get into playoffs and trying to find our game every week and get better so that when players arrived we are ready to go"" Turnbull said. ""I think there’s still a few areas that we can keep improving on but overall we’re pretty happy with where we’re at so we’re excited to get back on the ice for game two.""

The postseason outing continues a record-breaking regular season for the young league. In total the PWHL set six attendance records for women’s hockey this year with nearly 400000 fans showing up to watch the inaugural teams take the ice over the 72-game season.

East African Community Headquarters Arusha Tanzania 30th May 2021: The Secretary General of the East African Community Hon (Dr.) Peter Mathuki together with the Speaker of the East African Legislative Assembly Rt. Hon. Martin Ngoga and the Judge President of the East African Court of Justice Justice Nestor Kayobera paid a courtesy call on the President of of Burundi His Excellency Évariste Ndayishimiye at the Presidential Palace in Gitega Burundi on Saturday.

During the visit the Secretary General expressed his gratitude to the President and other members of the EAC Summit for his appointment as the sixth Secretary General of the Community.

“I am cognizant of the very heavy responsibilities inherent in this appointment. I shall therefore seek your wisdom and guidance on how best we as a Community can push the integration agenda further” said Dr. Mathuki.

“We as the leaders of the EAC Organs have resolved to enhance our collaboration and are committed to work together towards attaining the vision of the Community as guided by our Heads of State” added the Secretary General.

Dr. Mathuki briefed the President on the current EAC state of play on various integration matters including the ongoing efforts toward including French and Kiswahili as official languages of the Community as was directed by the 21st Ordinary Meeting of the EAC Heads of State held on 27th February 2021.

“I have forwarded official communication to various stakeholders to establish the infrastructure to incorporate French and Kiswahili as official languages of the Community” said Dr. Mathuki.

The Secretary General further said that the EAC was in the final stages of constituting a team of experts from the EAC Organs and Partner States to visit the Democratic Republic of Congo in June 2021 to undertake a verification mission to assess the country’s suitability to be admitted into the Community.

With regard to development initiatives Dr. Mathuki informed the Head of State that the EAC was in the process of identifying national competitive advantages adding that Burundi boasts fertile soils and high agricultural yields and the EAC was therefore keen on supporting the agricultural sector in the country.

“We have all seen the farm produce in Burundi and we are now looking into devising strategies that that will support the growth and development of the agricultural sector in Burundi” added Dr. Mathuki.

On infrastructure the Secretary General informed the President that various EAC infrastructure development initiatives were currently underway to interlink Burundi and the rest of the region. Such projects include the Manyovu/Mugina – Makamba -Nyanza Lac – Rumonge –Bujumbura section of the Sumbawanga Corridor as well as plans to construct a One Stop Border Post (OSBP) at the Malaba/Gusuru and development of the Tanganyika and Kalemi Ports.

“We are also looking into ways to develop Lake Tanganyika for better provision as an inland waterway as well as upscaling the fishing industry” said Dr. Mathuki.

On his part President Ndayishimiye commended the close collaboration between the Organs and Institutions of the Community adding that the same spirit should be emulated by the Partner States.

“We must have regional unity for with unity we shall have a strong foundation and together will be able to do anything. As members of the Community we should communicate with each other as well as with EAC Organs and Institutions to ensure we realise our vision” said the President.

The President commended the Secretary General for the progress made towards the inclusion of French and Kiswahili as official languages of the Community as well as the upcoming verification mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo.

On development priorities the President said that Burundi was currently promoting agriculture as an avenue to national development. “The people of Burundi are busy in the fields. However there is need to train them on how best they can explore the export markets” added President Ndayishimiye.

President Ndayishimiye further noted that Burundi has also prioritised women and youth empowerment through access to finance by establishing a bank for women as well as another bank for the youth.

The President called for enhanced regional connectivity through infrastructure development such as roads railways and communications to boost the movement of people across the region.

“We need to be able to move freely and also communicate easily. It is now time for Burundi to relook into joining the East African One Area Network in order to ease communication to other Partner States” he added.

The President reassured the EAC delegation of his commitment to the EAC integration adding that while some of the Partner States might be more developed than others the vision of a united and prosperous region remains.

The heads of the EAC Organs were accompanied by the EAC Deputy Secretary General in charge of the Productive and Social Sectors Hon. Christophe Bazivamo and the EAC Director General for Customs and Trade Mr. Kenneth Bagamuhunda.

But what about in space?

Researchers from UNLV’s College of Engineering and School of Dental Medicine teamed with NASA and Colgate-Palmolive to find out just how effective the personal care brand’s oral health products might be on periodontal disease or cavity-causing bacteria growing in the mouths of Earthlings working — and maybe even one day living — among the cosmos.

On June 3 an International Space Station-bound rocket SpaceX CRS-22 blasted off from Cape Canaveral Florida carrying oral bacteria and saliva gleaned from the mouths of 30 UNLV dental clinic patients contained in 25 kits developed by UNLV engineers.

After 34 days in space the kits — which contained 3D-printed battery-powered microfluidic pump devices and tested the germs’ growth and treatment with Colgate toothpastes mouthwashes and other disease-fighting products — returned to Earth.

During the course of the experiment UNLV researchers had to pull frequent allnighters to stay in contact with space station astronauts who operated on Greenwich Mean Time seven hours ahead of local time in Las Vegas.

The good news was that at least it didn’t hurt project collaborator Jeffrey Ebersole’s home life.

“My wife didn’t mind” Ebersole said. “She just told me not to wake her up when I (came home).”

Since coming back to terra firma the samples have been stored at UNLV before the pilot program moves into the next stage of working out testing protocols for these unique and valuable samples. The project began in 2019 when Colgate-Palmolive working in conjunction with NASA’s Center for the Advancement of Science in Space approached researchers at UNLV about growing oral biofilms on board the International Space Station.

“There are many great oral hygiene products. But if you think about long-term space travel there’s no guarantee that the Earth methods will work in zero gravity” said Ebersole an immunologist and associate dean for research at UNLV’s School of Dental Medicine. “This experiment will help push the envelope on understanding how one deals with oral health — both maintaining quality oral care and treating diseases— in space.”

The project had been two years in the making and like many things of late was temporarily stalled and continually challenged in development by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2019 Colgate-Palmolive working in conjunction with NASA’s Center for the Advancement of Science in Space approached UNLV about growing oral biofilms on the International Space Station. The UNLV researchers’ proposal was accepted by Colgate and NASA following a rigorous review process and development phase that was made lengthier by pandemic restrictions that slowed the acquisition of U.S. and overseas parts needed for fabrication and development. What’s more university scientists Colgate microbiologists and a payload implementation team from Teledyne-Brown Engineering were unable to conduct onsite office and lab work for months.

However UNLV engineering professors Shengjie (Patrick) Zhai and Hui Zhao who designed the testing kits — which include 3D-printed components — say it was worth the wait. They believe the multi-channel microfluidic devices are the first such instruments that both operate automatically without human intervention (via battery power) and dispense fluids at an ultra-low flow rate which mimic conditions that would occur inside the human mouth.

How It Works

UNLV dental clinical researchers Dr. John Gallob and Lacey Rahmig collected saliva and three different kinds of bacteria — microbes that constitute a healthy oral environment as well as germs that cause cavities and gum disease — from the mouths of 30 Las Vegas patients.

On Earth bacteria in our mouths grow attached to the surface of our teeth (that’s why you brush and floss — to remove the accumulated bacteria more commonly known as plaque). On the space station the bacteria will be grown at the average human body temperature of 98.6°F on 5 mm hydroxyapatite chips a hard substance that resembles the structure of teeth. The microfluidic devices designed by UNLV Engineering will hold the hydroxyapatite and allow liquid nutrients needed for bacterial growth to continuously flow over the chips. Each test ran for 48 hours and helped researchers evaluate whether conditions in space impact the bacteria’s response to the microgravity environment as well as the effect of the treatment agents to block the bacteria’s abilities to metabolize the nutrients and form biofilms that could destroy gum tissues and tooth enamel.

In order to ensure safety among and easy manipulation by the space crew each of the 25 kits is organized with color-coded fluid bags and matching tubing self-contained in 10-inch x 10-inch NASA-approved zip lock bags and required minimal handling by astronauts.

“That was one of the bigger challenges we had: How do we do this outside of our standard lab environment package it safely and make it as simple as possible for the crew to conduct the science” Ebersole said. “For example a liquid drop that escapes in zero gravity floats around with nothing to stop it and could end up in a crew member’s eye so you had to think through all these different experimental processes.

“One of the things that was pleasantly surprising was we had this crew of astronauts up there working on the space station and they were interested” Ebersole said. “They were enthusiastic. They were committed. We were in live real time with them in space and they offered suggestions on how things might work better. “They were wonderful absolutely wonderful people. They provided solutions to problems we didn’t even know we had until they were in space. It was a phenomenal team effort.”

Up Up and Away

Both Ebersole and Zhai traveled to Florida for the rocket launch. Once back in Las Vegas that’s when those 1 a.m. video calls with the space station took place.

The exhaustion was worth it though because now UNLV’s scientists and engineers are looking at doing another round of the same experiment a year or two down the road after everything has been processed from this round. It’s something that showcases just how important it is for the university to forge connections with government agencies such as NASA.

“Obviously we had to have some expertise but (the experiment) really was built on relationships” Ebersole said. “We’ve fostered those relationships even more broadly. We’ve developed technology here at UNLV that we may be able to use in other types of studies on the space station. So it really positions UNLV for some unique opportunities. “We don’t know exactly what they’re going to look like but we have our foot in the door to be able to do those things where we didn’t before.”

Zhai is excited about the potential for the project to attract young future scientists. He will be on hand to answer NASA personnel questions about test kit operations. Throughout the week Ebersole — who has enjoyed his crash course in space radio traffic lingo — will be available at odd hours (the flight crew operates on Greenwich Mean Time) to communicate with astronauts in real-time through video feeds from the space station as they work through the experiments.

For these two UNLV scientists the project represents dreams coming true for society and themselves.

“Along with firefighter and dinosaur hunter astronaut seems to be on every child’s list of dream jobs” Zhai said. “Now my astronaut dream has come true in another way.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZnJlZWZpbmNhbC5jb20vc3RvY2steGlyci1leGFtcGxlLTE4LWFubnVhbGl6ZWQtcmV0dXJuLWZyb20tY29sZ2F0ZS1wYWxtb2xpdmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stock XIRR Example: 18% annualized return from Colgate-Palmolive,"Last Updated on December 29 2021 at 6:15 pm

In this article let us consider an example of calculating the annualized return from a stock investment after accounting for corporate actions like dividends and stock splits. We shall consider Colgate-Palmolive the oldest stock in my portfolio.

The calculator used in this illustration can also handle bonuses buybacks and rights issues. It was first released as a beta version in Oct 2017 and is now being reworked for a fresh release to handle a full portfolio. The beta version is no longer available. We may recall that the CAGR (compounded annualized growth rate) is the measure of annualized return for single investments the IRR (intern rate of return) for periodic investments and the XIRR (extended IRR) for investments on random dates.

The XIRR for Colgate-Palmolive in my portfolio is 19.7% between Oct 2014 to May 2021. The same purchase dates shall be used in this example but only one stock is assumed to be purchased each time resulting in an XIRR of 18%.

XIRR calculation for investments in growth mutual funds or a stock that does not offer dividends or announce any other corporate action is quite simple. Suppose

you buy 200 stocks of a company at Rs. 1000 a share on 1st Jan 2010 You sell 25 of those stocks at Rs. 6000 a share on 7th July 2017 and calculate the XIRR as of 8th October 2017 (current market price is Rs. 6100). What is the annualized return?

To do this in Excel

Things become complicated with corporate actions. When a stock split or dividend is announced it is an action by the instrument and not an action by the investor. For example a dividend announced is money in our hands but we did not initiate this money transfer the company did.

So while computing XIRR we shall assume all dividends are reinvested on ex-date (date on which stock price has been adjusted to account for the latest dividend). This is this standard and universally accepted procedure to find out instrument returns. Also see: How to calculate returns from Dividend Mutual Funds and How to calculate returns from Stocks including dividends.

Many people make the mistake of assuming the dividend as a payout. This is certainly easier to do but is not universally accepted and can result in confusion. In this illustration we have not accounted for dividend taxation but this is quite simple to include.

Let us now continue with the above example. Now on 3rd March a 3:2 split is announced. That is since you hold 400 shares half that number or 200 shares will be given to you. This is because

400 x (3/2) = 400 x (1.5) = 400 + 400 * 0.5 = 400 + 200.

So now you will hold 600 shares. The price will drop by a factor of 1/.5. For example if the price before the split is Rs. 500 it will drop to 500/1.5 = 333.33.

This will again not be reflected in the cash flow. Entires for a 1:1 bonus on 2nd Feb 2011 is also included with the same reasoning.

Now a dividend of Rs. 2 per share is announced on 4th April 2013. Regardless of what you do with the dividend to find the XIRR of the instrument it will be assumed to be reinvested at the ex-dividend market price. Ex-dividend price is the price before dividend declaration minus the dividend rate.

So the dividend amount of 2 x 600 = 1200 is used to buy imaginary stocks for the XIRR calculation at the ex-div market price of Rs. 200.

So 1200/500 gives 2.4 stocks. Making the total stocks held as 602.4.

Many investors are confused by this and say that this wrong. It is however important to recognise that a dividend is an action by the instrument and not by us. Reinvesting stock or mutual fund dividends at ex-price is the standard procedure adopted to calculate instrument XIRR. This is also the procedure recommended by SEBI for mutual funds with dividend option.

Colgate-Palmolive Stock Transactions

The transactions made are shown in the image below. This is a screenshot from the calculator. Several dividends and one stock split are included. For purchases and redemptions the real-time market price can be included. For corporate actions one can either use the opening price or closing price on the ex-date. The opening price is probably more accurate but will not make much difference to the XIRR over the long term.

The XIRR calculation is shown below. The reinvested dividends result in a small increase in shares (relevant only for the XIRR calculation). Also notice that the splits and dividends are not shown as cashflow entires for XIRR.

With the current market price and date the XIRR is computed to be 18%.

This calculation can also be extended to an entire portfolio of stocks. The user will have to accomplish two tasks to get XIRR for a particular stock or portfolio. Get all transactions from the demat account trade book and then automatically extract the price on ex-dates. The final version of the XIRR calculator will hopefully feature this.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zb3dldGFubGl2ZS5jby56YS9uZXdzL3NvdXRoLWFmcmljYS8yMDIxLTA1LTI5LWFkLXdhdGNoZG9nLXRha2VzLWEtbGVnYWwtYmF0aC1hZnRlci1qdWRnZS1pbi1zb2FwLWNhc2Utc2F5cy1pdC1jYW5ub3QtcHVuaXNoLW5vbi1tZW1iZXJzL9IBmQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zb3dldGFubGl2ZS5jby56YS9hbXAvbmV3cy9zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EvMjAyMS0wNS0yOS1hZC13YXRjaGRvZy10YWtlcy1hLWxlZ2FsLWJhdGgtYWZ0ZXItanVkZ2UtaW4tc29hcC1jYXNlLXNheXMtaXQtY2Fubm90LXB1bmlzaC1ub24tbWVtYmVycy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ad watchdog takes a legal bath after judge in soap case says it cannot punish non-members,Please click here to view our site optimised for your device.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhbnRlbGV2aXNpb24uY29tL21hbS9tYXJrZXRpbmcvbWFtL2NvdmlkLTE5LWVmZmVjdC1kZXR0b2wtdG9pbGV0LXNvYXAtdG9wcy1iYXJjLWxpc3QtaW4td2Vlay0yMC0yMTA1MjnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVID-19 effect: Dettol Toilet Soap tops BARC list in week 20,"Mumbai: As people in India became more aware of personal and home hygiene due to the coronavirus pandemic antiseptic soaps and cleaning liquid brands topped the advertising charts released by the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC).

Philadelphia City Hall was the tallest structure in Philadelphia from 1894 to 1986 at 548 then in 1987 the steel structure of One Liberty Place eventually passed the statue to soon top out its spire at 945 feet. The same developers of Liberty Place also developed the next tallest skyscraper in the city the 974-foot Comcast Center from 2007 to 2017. In 2017 across the street to the west the Comcast Technology Center became the tallest skyscraper in the city since 2017 and its first supertall skyscraper at 1121 feet. For this development Comcast had partnered with Liberty Property Trust which was originally known as Rouse and Associates. The tower was designed by Foster and Partners which has designed iconic structures such as the Gherkin in London and the Hearst Tower in Midtown Manhattan. Today Philly YIMBY looks back at the period when the iconic tower’s spire topped out.

The photographs are taken just under two months after the topping of the tower with the glass on the lantern already underway at the time. When first witnessing the completed steel structure a sense of relief and amazement flows as the tower reaches an incredible height and the structure was done rising. The tower crane attached to the south side of the tower had its cab at a height around 1030 feet as the tip of the boom stood a a height of 1150 feet when maneuvered to its highest angle.

On the west side of the skyscraper the temporary construction elevator was coming down to soon install the glass on the “spine” of the building. The cladding on the skyscraper not including the cooling towers and spire have been completed since October 2017 giving a glimpse at the final look of the skyscraper though lots of protective blue tape was on the metal cladding.

NBCUniversal and Lionsgate

Buying Lionsgate would help Comcast's NBCUniversal on two different fronts. First it would add more content to Peacock NBCUniversal's subscription video service. Lionsgate owns shows including ""Mad Men"" ""Orange is the New Black"" ""Nashville"" and ""Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist."" Lionsgate currently licenses those shows to a grab bag of streaming services. Second Lionsgate owns premium network Starz which would fit seamlessly with NBCUniversal's offerings. NBCUniversal doesn't have a premium network unlike competitors WarnerMedia (HBO) and ViacomCBS (Showtime). On the streaming front a Starz-Peacock combination -- either together as one service or separately as a bundled offering -- could expand NBCUniversal's global aspirations. Starz is on track to have 60 million global subscribers by 2025 Chief Executive John Feltheimer said this week. Starz is already available in 58 different countries which would give Peacock a head start in its expansion aspirations. And Lionsgate wouldn't cost much with a market capitalization of just $3.8 billion (an an enterprise value of about $6.4 billion). If Comcast is going to keep NBCUniversal -- bucking AT&T's decision to give up on vertical integration -- buying Lionsgate would be a sensible move to stay competitive in the streaming wars without breaking the bank.

WarnerMedia-Discovery and ViacomCBS

There's already speculation about a potential future merger between the newly created WarnerMedia-Discovery entity (assuming the deal closes) and NBCUniversal. Discovery's controlling shareholder John Malone said on CNBC how the combined company could be open to a future merger with NBCUniversal if regulatory forces would allow it. But the divestments that might have to take place could be too complicated and tax-inefficient for that combination to occur. Regulators might not allow CNN and MSNBC to be housed under one corporate roof. Combining Comcast's Universal and WarnerMedia's Warner Bros. -- the No. 2 and No. 3 largest film studios by box office revenue in 2019 and 2018 the last full years of theatrical releases -- may also be a non-starter. The more logical combination would be WarnerMedia-Discovery and ViacomCBS . Shari Redstone's company has a broadcast network -- CBS. WarnerMedia-Discovery doesn't so that's a fit. (The combination of CBS and NBC under one roof would be one major roadblock to a ViacomCBS-NBCUniversal merger.) Unlike NBCUniversal ViacomCBS doesn't have a large cable news network. That makes keeping CNN more viable. While ViacomCBS also owns a movie studio Paramount has been a much smaller box office presence than Universal in recent years. Among global film studios Paramount was sixth in box office revenue in both 2018 and 2019. Putting together Paramount and Warner Bros. would be an easier sell for antitrust concerns. The biggest complication would be if Redstone is willing to give up or dilute her controlling ViacomCBS shares. That's what Malone did to push Discovery and WarnerMedia together so there's now a template.

Disney and AMC Networks

This is the hardest sell. Disney doesn't really need AMC Networks . It's doing perfectly fine with the content it has. But with Disney-owned Hulu licensing so much of its content it's vulnerable to losing some of its hit shows. MGM for example makes ""The Handmaid's Tale."" Now that Amazon has acquired MGM it's unclear if the series will remain on Hulu once that deal closes. The owner of ""The Walking Dead"" IFC Films and Sundance Now could provide an adult-themed content boost to Hulu. That would balance out the robust kids' offering on Disney+ and sports on ESPN+. AMC has forecast it will have at least 9 million streaming subscribers by the end of 2021 and 25 million by the end of 2025. That's a far cry from Hulu's current 41.6 million or Disney+'s 103.6 million but it's evidence that there's at least some audience for the programming. And while cable is slowly dying it's not dead yet with about 85 million U.S. households still subscribing to some form of bundled linear TV. Disney's ESPN remains the lifeblood of the traditional pay-TV bundle. Bundling AMC Networks' cable networks with ESPN would protect affiliate fees as pay-TV providers have always been loathe to drop ESPN. The Dolan Family controls AMC Networks. The Dolans have likely known for years that AMC Networks is subscale and should combine with a bigger media fish. If the Dolans don't want to sell they won't. But AMC Networks is relatively tiny at $2.2 billion in market valuation and about $4 billion in enterprise value. Disney could easily buy the company in cash. However Disney's previous acquisitions -- Pixar Marvel Lucas Films -- have been for intellectual property. Does AMC Networks own enough valuable IP to make a deal worth it for shareholders? And is that IP family-friendly enough to mesh with the company's theme park business? That may be why a Disney-AMC deal hasn't already happened.

It’s called a Barnacle and it was stuck on his windshield by the private company that manages parking at the church lots. “About a year ago” says the musician signs went up at both lots “that parking was being run by AirGarage and that you’re supposed to scan the QR code on their sign or call the number and use your phone to make a payment with a credit card. So I did that.”

“But then one day I was talking to somebody at the Methodist church and he said ‘Oh we don’t really pay much attention to that. The signs are there just to kind of discourage people.'”

So when the musician saw the Barnacle “I was befuddled and perplexed. It was after hours. There was nobody in the church. It was not taking anything away from anybody. With the First Methodist I had done so much work with the music department there I kind of felt like an insider.”

He was an outsider now–and barnacled. “There was no getting it off” he says. “and you absolutely could not have driven with it on.” So he scanned the code on the device and discovered it would cost him $400 to remove–with half refundable when he returned the device.

“I had no option” he says. He paid the $400 online with a credit card and was texted a code to enter into a keypad on the device releasing the suction cups that held it in place. “Then they said this has to be returned within twenty-four hours or we’ll charge an additional $1000!”

He tried calling and texting but all he got was an address on E. Washington. Flustered “I put the thing in my backseat and drove home. Every ten or fifteen minutes it would give off the most wretched ear-splitting chirp.”

The next morning he returned to look around in daylight. In the Methodists’ lot he saw “this homemade little shanty thing. I walked over and by golly this was the Barnacle return bin.”

He dropped it off but later stopped at First Baptist to ask his friends there what was going on. They “said that they were frustrated with people parking on their lot” he recalls. “As these high-rise luxury apartment buildings keep springing up here there and everywhere the demand for parking in that part of Ann Arbor is increased exponentially. It would be a shame to not be able to utilize those spaces especially because the churches aren’t using them.”

Will he ever park there illegally again? “Hell no!”

—

AirGarage was started in 2017 at Arizona State University by students Scott Fitsimones Chelsea Border and Jonathon Barkl. “We wanted basically to make parking as easy as pulling a garage out of thin air” says Barkl of the name.

They started by renting driveways from nearby homeowners and then moved on to churches. One was renting out its parking during the work week but “had these hair-on-fire problems running this parking lot and spending 90 percent of their time as a church focused on ‘how do we run this parking lot’ and 10 percent of their time focused on ‘how do we run the church'” Barkl says. So AirGarage made them an offer to “take all of this off your plate.”

The church agreed and they split the parking revenue. “The church gets 70 percent we get 30 percent and then our 30 percent goes towards covering the cost of installing signage and doing enforcement and processing payments from drivers” explains Barkl.

They found the perfect enforcement tool in the Barnacle. Introduced in 2016 by NYC-based Barnacle Parking Solutions it effectively immobilizes vehicles without the hassles and costs of towing and impounding them.

“Churches are great partners” emails Barkl. “They have underutilized parking spaces available for the community and the additional funding generated through public parking helps them support their outreach and community assistance programs. It’s a win-win.”

AirGarage now has eleven full-time employees and operates lots in 115 locations in thirty states–and Fitsimones Border and Barkl have all dropped out of school to become respectively the company’s chief technology officer chief data officer and chief executive officer.

First Baptist was their first Ann Arbor client in 2019. “We reached out to them via email” says Barkl. He says the pitch was “You’re a perfect fit for this based on your location. It seems like you would really actually make a pretty good amount of money.”

“AirGarage has just been such a great partnership” says Paula Burton chair of First Baptist’s board of trustees. “We think very highly of them.”

Illegal parkers had always been a problem. “We would put warnings on cars the windows and keep a record of who had parked in the lot” explains church business manager Kat Becker. “And usually after three or four warnings we’d give them a final warning and then they would be towed.” But all that enforcement chewed up a huge part of Becker’s day.

“Having a partnership with AirGarage it actually frees me up to do my work” she says. And they’re making $1400 monthly from the lot now.

“One of the biggest selling points was just the flexibility of their app” adds Burton “and telling them on any given day or even any given set of hours in a day you can have five spaces or you can have twenty-three.”

AirGarage has since added the lots at First Methodist and U-M Hillel as well as a private parking lot on E. Liberty near Fifth. It’s “a risk-free way for churches or small businesses to find new income” Barkl says.

He touts its convenience for drivers as well. “When you get there you push the start button when you leave you push an end button and we bill you for the exact amount of time that you parked.”

But then there’s what happens when drivers don’t pay. Barkl wouldn’t connect us to a local AirGarage worker but says they go through the lots on a regular basis leaving warnings on vehicles that haven’t paid to park and aren’t registered as belonging to the lot owners. AirGarage promotes its system as a better alternative to booting or towing because drivers don’t have to find a ride to a tow lot to get their cars back or pay impound fees. “Our goal was never really to Barnacle someone” Barkl says. “But after three warnings then we will unfortunately have to Barnacle people.”

Asked how often that happens he emails that they’ve Barnacled about five cars per month in Ann Arbor since October 1 “compared with the approximately 2500 vehicles that have been legally parked in these parking lots.”

What if a driver complains? “We look them up in our system and we say well actually I do have a photo record that shows your same vehicle was here on this date this date and this date” he writes.

We emailed the musician to ask if he remembered getting any warning.

“Well … now that you mention it I do recall finding a slip of paper under my windshield wiper once telling me to contact them and pay” he wrote back. “I hung on to it for a little while while I pondered what to do and it got forgotten.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9oZWFsdGgvdGlja3MtYmFiZXNpb3Npcy8yMDIxLzA1LzI4LzVmMDJlMGMwLWE4NTMtMTFlYi04YzFhLTU2ZjBjYjRmZjNiNV9zdG9yeS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Babesiosis a dangerous tick-borne infection that attacks red blood cells appears to be a growing problem,Jeff Naticchia wasn’t feeling well when he set off to work one Friday in late July 2017.

The weekend’s three-game meltdown by New York was a reminder of past playoff poundings while the young Tigers continued to show promise.

Starter Tarik Skubal tossed six shutout innings on Sunday leading the Tigers to a 6-2 win against the New York Yankees.

Baseball is slowly inching its way back to life in downtown Detroit further witnessed by 8000 fans the final one before full capacity will be allowed for the Tigers next home game June 8.

BOX SCORE: Tigers 6 Yankees 2

Skubal struck out eight batters in six scoreless innings becoming the first Tigers rookie to strike out eight or more batters in three consecutive starts.

The left-hander threw a first-pitch strike to 19 of the 23 batters he faced including a stretch of eight straight before throwing ball one to his final batter of the afternoon. He then got Gleyber Torres to fly out on the next pitch his 95th and final one of a solid month.

“Going right at guys is something important to me” Skubal said. “And just being able to put guys away with two strikes was big.”

Meanwhile Willi Castro continued to break out of a slump with a three-run double in the third inning. He reached base three times Sunday after a two-hit night Saturday.

The Tigers have won 13 of their last 20 games heading into a six-game road trip this week against Milwaukee and the Chicago White Sox.

“This has been a few weeks now where we’ve put some things together and we’ve had our stretch of good and only spurts of bad” Tigers manager AJ Hinch said. “The players start to feel that momentum and feel that excitement.”

After a rough April Skubal’s May was strong. The 24-year-old struck out 39 batters while issuing nine walks in 27 innings good for a 3.33 ERA.

Skubal allowed the game’s first two batters to reach but then got Aaron Judge to ground into a double play. He escaped danger but Hinch said starting games as well as he finishes outings is the charge for the rookie.

Skubal showed his arsenal by striking out Giancarlo Stanton and Judge out in the third inning on six pitches part of an eight-pitch inning that was his best. During the six-pitch domination of two of baseball’s best premier power hitters Skubal threw them each a pitch in the 70s one in the 80s and another in the 90s.

“He really got strong as the outing went along” Hinch said. Teamed with brilliant recent outings from Casey Mize and Spencer Turnbull — along with two home runs from Spencer Torkelson on Saturday for West Michigan and continued excellence from Riley Greene in Erie — young Tigers are giving reasons for hope.

The beatdown of the Bronx Bombers wasn’t the only reason to reminisce as Miguel Cabrera ran through an early stop sign on the base paths.

But Tigers fans could smile this time as Cabrera scored from first base on a two-run Nomar Mazara double to make it 2-0 in the first.

“We joked with Miggy in the dugout you know we’re collecting all these balls for him” Hinch said. “He probably just set the record for most times running through a stop sign in the history of baseball.

“That’s not fact-checked but that’s how we’re talking to him.”

Castro’s double down the third-base line capped the four-run third inning to make it 6-0.

Detroit had chances to put it away but Cabrera and Eric Haase stranded the bases loaded in the second and sixth innings respectively.

And how a little bullpen fragility for a trip down memory lane?

Bryan Garcia allowed a New York run in the eighth inning and then was relieved by Michael Fulmer. With two outs and two on Gary Sanchez plated Judge on a grounder to shortstop. Rookie shortstop Zack Short’s throw got past Jonathan Schoop but Sanchez was thrown out at second trying to advance.

The impressive collection of Yankees fans in attendance groaned as Sanchez quickly realized he was toast. The lead was down to 6-2 but a full-blown meltdown was averted by the Yankees miscue.

Then in the ninth Fulmer allowed hits to the first two batters set down the next two but walked Stanton to load the bases.

The powerful Judge represented the tying run but Fulmer got him to watch a third strike at 1-2 for the win.

Cue Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believing” and good times didn’t seem as far away as a month before.

Yankee Stadium fans will be ready to boo its confounding team this week against Tampa Bay the American League’s defending champions and its best team.

Meanwhile the fans will be allowed to show up in full force now at Comerica Park.

Stringing together more settings like Sunday — with the sun shining the Yankees floundering and prospects starting to figure out the big leagues — would surely start to bring back some starving sports fans.

Robbie Grossman slugged a two-run walk-off home run against Justin Wilson to turn a 2-1 deficit into a 3-2 win.

There was some wackiness earlier in the game. In the sixth inning Yankees third baseman Gio Urshela took first base on a ""walk"" despite taking only three balls. No one caught the error when it happened. Not home plate umpire Vic Carapazza not the Tigers not the broadcasters. If Urshela and the Yankees knew about it they sure weren't going to say anything.

Here's the full at-bat. It seems the confusion stems from the fourth pitch which apparently registered as a ball even though Urshela fouled it away with a little half-check swing (Carapazza did signal foul):

Ultimately the three-ball walk did not come back to bite the Tigers. Righty Kyle Funkhouser stranded Urshela and Detroit went on to win the game so even the potential butterfly effect went in their favor. No harm no foul.

Following the game crew chief Jerry Meals told a pool reporter the umpire crew just missed the call according to MLive.com's Evan Woodbery. It wasn't until after the game that they realized Urshela walked on only three balls.

Special to the Detroit Free Press

As diverse new housing pours into the empty slots of Detroit’s once run-down Brush Park this four-story town house is an example you could call City Modern.

It is tall making the most of expensive land by stacking square footage four floors high. It pulls the neighborhood together with floor-to-ceiling windows even flanking the sidewalk. From inside your home or from your front stoop you are set to mix with fellow Brush Parkers.

It creates private space and views on the roof — actually two spaces. One outdoor deck on the front roof faces south to the Tigers’ Comerica Park the Lions’ Ford Field and downtown Detroit. The other on the rear roof faces north into Brush Park.

Joshua and Alison Crites bought this town house as it was being built but never got to live there. Alison Crites wanted to walk to her job at the Detroit Institute of Arts. Her husband can work almost anywhere they said including home.

“We were really taken with the vision of developers to create density in Detroit this way” Joshua Crites said.

Alison Crites already lived in Midtown when they met and wanted to stay in the museum district. “I wanted to take advantage of all the awesomeness of Detroit” she said “walk to shops walk to work.”

They looked at condos inside Brush Park’s surviving 1800s mansions as well as Lafayette Park’s Mies van der Rohe town houses. They were won by this “spectacular architecture” she said.

But construction took much longer than planned and life intervened. The two moved in together got married and had twins. Alison Crites accepted a job at an out-of-state museum.

They are gone now but the extras they put in their town house remain. That includes finishing the two open-air roof decks and upgrades for the kitchen and baths.

The entry level has one big room shown here with a sofa. It had been the couple’s plan to make this into their library and cover that wall with books. At the back of this room a door leads out to a two-car garage that’s entered from the rear. At its front a window wall looks out at the passing Alfred Street scene.

One flight up the open second floor spreads out the functions of a main floor. The front end of it is a living room again with floor-to-ceiling windows.

At the rear is the kitchen and a space for casual eating. Just outside the kitchen is a small covered balcony. They call this their “New York Times balcony” — the place to have coffee and read the Times on Sunday morning.

The pair added extras to the kitchen. For example its island’s countertop is white quartz and it’s done in “waterfall” style.

That means besides the flat top the vertical sides are also made from quartz. It’s extra deep as well to make sitting there more comfortable. Behind the range they had a backsplash made of herringbone tile. They made the cabinets extra tall.

This second level also has a more formal spot for eating between the kitchen and the living room. It also has a powder room.

The next floor up the third has two bedrooms and two full baths. Here again they upgraded the tile and the counters in the bathrooms.

The fourth floor they call the entertaining floor. This has a large bonus room between the front and rear decks. They had a long cabinet with a sink built in to create a bar for parties that can spill out on both decks.

After all their house-hunting and all waiting through construction it wasn’t easy to leave this condo Joshua Crites said.

“I’m a little jealous of the people who are going to buy it.”

Gleyber Torres didn’t need anyone to speak to him. He knew he screwed up twice. The shortstop’s two errors in a three-error inning on Sunday was far from the biggest issue the Yankees had this weekend but he seemed to be acting collectively for the Yankees and their fans when he went back to the dugout and dramatically pummeled his glove.

“This is just a bad ending to a terrible weekend” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said after his team lost to the Tigers 6-2 at Comerica Park.

The Tigers (22-31) swept the three-game series the second time this year the Bombers have been swept. The Yankees (29-24) have lost five of their last six games and head home to face the AL East division-leading Rays (34-20) followed by the Red Sox (32-30) playing some of their worst baseball.

“What we’ve been putting out there right now is not our best and it’s unacceptable” said Aaron Judge who struck out with the bases loaded in the top of the ninth inning.

Gleyber Torres and the Yankees were swept by the Tigers.

It was perhaps the perfect ending for the Yankees offense here over the last three games. They scored just five runs and went 2-for-25 with runners in scoring position.

“That’s where we just got to dig down deeper make some changes ….you just can’t keep coming to the plate trying to do the same thing expecting different results” said Judge who went 3-for-13 over the weekend. “So I think it’s just about us collectively just doing our homework and coming out of here … we got some big series coming up and especially having the Rays and the Red Sox coming into town. So two big series for us in our division. So it’s just about us doing our homework to prepare forget about the series and learn from it.”

The Yankees’ streaky offense has struggled for the last 11 games averaging less than three runs a game. Defensively however they had been solid for a few weeks after a sloppy start. That is doubly true for Torres who had tightened up his defense for the past few weeks until Sunday when he botched two routine plays.

Torres’ first error came as he tried to casually backhand Victor Reyes’ ball allowing one run to score. After a walk a two-run double and a strikeout Torres just bobbled Jeimer Candelario’s ball right to short to keep the inning alive.

“I mean (those) are routine plays and I make two mistakes but I am really working hard and when I make mistakes it is a little bit of frustration for me” Torres said.

Torres’ errors his seventh and eighth of the year came on the heels of a rare Gio Urshela mistake. The third baseman was charged with a fielding error on Eric Haase’s broken bat ground ball.

“I feel like we put a lot of these mistakes you know especially defensively behind us. So defensively speaking this has been an outlier” Boone said. “Some of the base running mishaps that still continue to happen a little bit too much. We’ve got to get better. And all we can do is address them and try to educate as best we can. But that part of the game needs to be cleaned up.”

Running the bases has been a consistent problem for the Yankees who lead the majors on outs on bases. In the eighth with two outs Gary Sanchez singled in a run on a ground ball to Tigers shortstop Zack Short whose throw to first was wide. The lumbering catcher tried to make a wide turn at first and got caught running awkwardly between second and first when the ball ricocheted back to the first baseman. That was the Yankees’ 26th out on the bases this season and it killed their eighth-inning rally.

“I tried to be aggressive there on that play. It ended up being not a good decision” Sanchez said through Yankees interpreter Marlon Abreu. “It’s something that happens and you gotta understand it. When you face it again make a better decision and (turn) the page and look forward to tomorrow.”

This weekend exposing the Yankees weaknesses has not rattled Boone though.

“It’s absolutely good enough” Boone said of his roster. “We had a bad weekend. As pissed off as I am and as we should be by the way we played it’s a bad weekend. We need to turn the page we have an important homestand coming up against some really good opponents.”"

The US Department of Justice under Mr Biden's administration defended a Trump-era decision to allow the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska's north slope saying it was ""reasonable and consistent"" with the law.

The department's defence means the Biden administration is standing against a lawsuit brought by environmental groups that wanted to halt the drilling over concerns that it would have a negative impact on wildlife and increase emissions in the region.

Though Mr Biden paused all new drilling leases affecting public lands he is allowing the Alaskan project to continue.

The Guardian reported that the project which is called Willow is being directed by ConocoPhillips an oil company and is slated to extract more than 100000 barrels of oil every day for the next 30 years.

Activists opposed to the drilling said the administration's support of the project flies in the face of his vows to combat climate change and reduce US emissions.

Kristen Monsell and attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity expressed her disappointment with the decision to The Guardian.

“It’s incredibly disappointing to see the Biden administration defending this environmentally disastrous project” she said. “President Biden promised climate action and our climate can’t afford more huge new oil-drilling projects.”

In order to drill for oil in an environment that is rapidly heating – the Arctic is heating three times faster than the rest of the planet – ConocoPhillips has to resort to using ""chillers"" injected into the Alaskan permafrost to stop extensive melting while it drills.

Ms Monsell said the need for such tactics ""highlights the ridiculousness of drilling in the Arctic.""

The Willow project requires up to 250 wells and infrastructure to support them which includes a processing facility hundreds of miles of pipelines roads and an airstrip.

The Trump administration green-lit the project in the last months of his presidency and activists hoped Mr Biden would reverse his decision.

In addition to environmental activists' opposition Native Alaskan groups have also complained about the project saying it could hurt the area's wildlife like polar bears fish and caribou.

“This project is in the important fall migration for Nuiqsut” Rosemary Ahtuangaruak a resident of nearby Nuiqsut told The Guardian. “It should not happen. The village spoke in opposition and the greed for profit should not be allowed over our village.”

“Le dije a James que yo tomaba la decisión de desafectarlo de la convocatoria hasta que él hiciera su recuperación como corresponde” expresó Rueda en una conferencia de prensa.

Explicó que el objetivo es que el jugador del Everton quien ha tenido una temporada marcada por las lesiones se recupere “con los tiempos prudentes”.

Rueda espera que el exjugador recupere su forma para que pueda jugar un pretemporada completa con su club y que la selección pueda contar con él en las próximas fechas.

“La decisión es que debemos cuidarlo sabemos la importancia que tiene James para la selección para el futuro nuestro inmediato para los próximos diez juegos que se nos vienen: los tres de septiembre los tres de octubre los dos de enero” dijo el técnico campeón de la Copa Libertadores de 2016 con Atlético Nacional.

Rodríguez de 29 años se mostró decepcionado con la decisión de Rueda de no convocarlo para los partidos contra Perú y Argentina del 3 y 8 de junio respectivamente y dijo que ya completó su “recuperación” y que está en forma para competir.

Aseguró que la decisión le “llena de profunda decepción” por lo que significa para él jugar por su país.

Sobre ese comunicado Rueda señaló que “es normal” que el jugador manifieste su disconformidad por la decisión y agregó que “es el dolor de un momento que va a tener su duelo”.

Por otra parte y tras la desconvocatoria también de Juan Fernando Quintero del Shenzhen chino Rueda aseguró que trabaja para llamar a un reemplazo que se sume a Edwin Cardona volante de Boca Juniors llamado a última hora a la convocatoria.

“Estoy en las horas de decidir dos posibles nuevos nombres para sumar a la convocatoria si es posible estos dos juegos y después mirar lo que pase para Copa América” expresó el seleccionador.

En cuanto a Perú rival del jueves aseguró que es un equipo “con gran proyección” y que tiene “una evolución muy interesante” pues cuenta con veteranos como Paolo Guerrero y con futbolistas como Edison Flores que juega en el DC United estadounidense.

President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said his government reached an agreement for the US brewer Constellation Brands to build a plant in the southeast of the country following the controversial cancellation of a previous billionaire project in the northwest.

Constellation Brands which distributes the popular Corona beer and other brands of the Mexican Grupo Modelo in the United States was building a factory in Mexicali but a controversial local popular consultation promoted by López Obrador in March 2020 halted its plans.

In his usual morning press conference the president reported that his administration explained to the company that it could not go ahead with the initiative due to the lack of water in the area and the result in the popular consultation not supervised by national electoral authorities against the plan.

“They understood and now they are going to set up a brewery but in the southeast where there is a lot of water. And an agreement was reached” added the president without offering further details. Constellation Brands did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

After the consultation the company and the government announced that they were seeking an agreement to resolve the controversy and last April the Mexican press published that the brewery informed its shareholders on Wall Street that it was looking for an alternative in the Mexican southeast.

The company which was open to dialogue from the beginning was building the plant in Mexicali with an investment of 1.4 billion dollars and intended to start operating the factory this year.

The cancellation of the project is in addition to other investments halted by the AMLO government as López Obrador is popularly known which have generated discontent among businessmen and strained relations with the United States and other countries.

Second-seeded Corning finished with a 37-3 record and its second NJCAA Division III national runner-up finish under head coach Stacy Johnson.

Top-seeded Rock Valley from Illinois earned its seventh consecutive Division III national championship to cap a 51-7 season. There was no tournament last year because of the pandemic.

Rock Valley was an 8-0 winner over Corning in six innings in Saturday's semifinals. The Golden Eagles finished the eight-team double-elimination tournament with a 4-0 record outscoring opponents by a combined 57-3.

How Rock Valley won

After Corning scored in the bottom of the first inning the Golden Eagles took command with four runs in the second and three in the third. Rock Valley scored in each of its final six offensive innings and collected 17 hits off Red Barons pitchers Emily McCreery and Jayden Hill.

Elizabeth Schriner went 4-for-5 with a double three runs and two RBIs for Rock Valley. Kirstin Fudge had a single double and three RBIs. Kelly Riordan and Evy Polsfuss drove in two runs each.

Rock Valley starter Ashton Melaas gave up six hits and two runs over 6 2/3 innings with six strikeouts and no walks. Jenna Lawson came in to record the final out.

CCC offensive leaders

Kiki Grover an Elmira High graduate went 3-for-4 for Corning and scored the Red Barons' first run.

Horseheads High School graduate Jill Murray went 2-for-3 with RBI singles in the first and third innings.

Thomas A. Edison alumna Jodie Burdick was 2-for-3. CCC's other hit came from Christina Willsey a former teammate of Burdick's on Edison's 2019 Class C state championship team.

Season for the record books

CCC broke the 2009 program record of 36 victories in a season with Saturday's 4-3 win over Herkimer to advance to the championship round. The three losses were the fewest in program history for a full season and Corning set a program record with its .925 winning percentage.

CCC head coach Stacy Johnson the Red Barons' head coach since 1998 now has a career record of 596-215.

Samsung has with the Galaxy S21 Ultra as has Xiaomi with the new Redmi Note 10 Pro. However the latter is four to five times cheaper than the latter.

Unsurprisingly Xiaomi has stressed just how Gorilla Glass Victus is. As the video below shows the company has subjected the display to screwdrivers and razor blades without causing any visible damage. Additionally the durability video shows Xiaomi tossing the new Redmi Note 10 Pro around with ice stones and walnuts. The company even puts the device into a washing machine with dozens of nuts and screws in an attempt to damage it.

Gorilla Glass Victus withstands all this along with attempts to bend it. Ultimately while it is good to see Xiaomi equipping a mid-range smartphone with the same glass as its competitors use in their flagship devices we doubt that the new Redmi Note 10 Pro could survive this much abuse outside of a controlled environment. Naturally you can make up your mind after watching the video below.

Herkimer the third seed in the double-elimination tournament had rattled off three consecutive wins following a first-round loss and was trying to continue its run.

Unlike the previous day however a last-inning rally wasn't in the cards for Herkimer as the Generals dropped a 4-3 decision in a nail-biter to No. 2 seed Corning Community College on Saturday evening at Carrier Park.

With the setback the Generals finish the season at 21-6 overall and third place in the NJCAA Division III.

Corning (37-2) advances to play No. 1 Rock Valley (50-7) for the national championship. Rock Valley (50-7) needs only one win Sunday for its seventh consecutive national title. The championship is Sunday after the schedule was shifted because of Friday's rain.

In Herkimer's second game Saturday the Generals led 3-1. Corning grabbed a 4-3 lead with a two-run sixth inning.

In the bottom of 7th Herkimer had runners on second and third base with two outs. However Corning Jayden Hill induced a groundout to shortstop to end the game.

Early win

It was a tough end for Herkimer which had a mantra of “We’re not done yet” following a win Friday over North Dakota State College of Science and a 6-4 victory over the RCSJ Gloucester on Saturday morning.

Unlike most of the tournament the Generals jumped out to an early lead in the bottom of the first inning against RCSJ thanks to a sacrifice fly from Madison Ihnat.

“We wanted to get out to a faster start” coach PJ Anadio said following the first game. “We’re a team that likes to put runs up and sometimes we’ve been waiting around and waiting around and that’s not our identity. It felt good to get out there and get a lead first.”

The lead did not last though as Victoria London hit a two-run home run in the top of the second inning to give the Roadrunners the 2-1 advantage.

The Generals responded. In the bottom half of the inning Victoria Borowski drove in Alexis Van Patten to tie up the game and then Aubrey Ketcham followed that up with a single that scored Borowski giving Herkimer the 3-2 lead.

Things got interesting in the fourth inning as coach Anadio argued a call.

""They just trust me to do my job they know I’m going to go out there and battle and scratch and claw for everything” Anadio said. “It’s our identity. If I ask them to that then I have to do the same thing. I have to have their backs.”

The call in question happened when Mackenzie Long of RCSJ appeared to hit first baseman Olivia Guy on her way to first base. Long was called safe and after a long deliberation between all three field umpires and tournament officials the call was upheld.

Heading into the bottom of the fourth the game was tied until Guy's at-bat. With two outs Guy's hit to deep center field went off of the center fielder's glove and over the fence for a home run to give the Generals the 4-3 lead.

From there Herkimer was in control of the game behind Hannah DeRock. She pitched seven innings and struck out two to pick up the win.

“Hannah made some great adjustments this week” Anadio said. “Coming off of ACL surgery her last year of high school she missed all of last year didn’t get to play summer ball couldn’t play fall ball. I feel like she’s now hitting her stride and showing us what she’s really got.”

In the bottom of the fifth inning the Generals added two runs on a sacrifice fly from Melissa Daigneault and a single from Maiya Reinhart.

In the top of the 7th the Roadrunners scored a run before pinch runner Olivia Farina was thrown out trying to advance to third base to end the game.

Costco is one of our most valued big box retailers known for large quantities and affordable loss leader deals like hot dogs and roast chicken. Yet while we all know there are high-end products available Costco's newest offering will make shoppers feel as if they have fallen into an episode of ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous."" Customers can take Costco's bottle of scotch home for a mere $29999 (via Reddit). No that's not a typo. Locked up behind a glass case at the Washington D.C. location Costco has a bottle of fancy scotch available for almost $30000 and that's actually a discount off of last year's offering of the same style product for $34999.99 (via Reddit).

Social media users are dumbfounded over the scotch as most cannot fathom what to do with a bottle of liquor this fancy. Of course jokes abound about mixing this with soda or adding a chaser but Redditor unclassified1 gets the punchline with the quip ""Can I use the Costco return policy after enjoying a few glasses and deciding it's 'not for me'??"" Commenting on last year's bottle elivings1 added ""I always found it funny that Costco will sell these items for thousands of [dollars] to the point it is a down payment on a house. I was looking up watches to buy and found watches that were 55k. It begs the question on who can spend this amount of money.""

The combination was stunning and so began my interest in the work of Toronto-based photographer Gary Cummins. Scrolling through his feed I fell in love with his street and drone photography as well. Reading about his process I was surprised to learn the special way he used his drone to create his images. However he wasn’t using his drone’s camera.

I sent Gary a DM to see if he would be open to company during one of his astro shoots. He agreed but our plan to meet never occurred. However we did strike up an internet friendship and chatted thereafter. Once I started doing some writing for Drone DJ I knew I’d want to feature Gary’s drone photography.

His start with photography

Gary moved to Toronto from Waterford Ireland in 2011 after living in Australia and New Zealand. His new home inspired him to pick up a camera for street photography. His education was self-guided and he learned through making mistakes. I asked about how he transitioned from street photography to astrophotography and eventually to drone photography.

“The transition came about after a 10-week trip that took me to Iceland Faroe Islands Hong Kong & Southwest USA” he tells me. “During this trip I was surrounded by so much nature and dark skies that I made it a mission to dive a bit deeper into it upon my return to Canada.”

Eventually this love of the stars led him to drone photography.

I used a DJI Phantom in the beginning with two Lume Cubes attached but when the Mavic 2 Pro was released I jumped at it due to its portability. It was an easy decision. I use them primarily for light painting these days due to restrictions here in Canada. I do have some ideas however for some photography projects this year.

The Abandoned series

When asked what inspired him to use his drone for more than cool photos and videos he cites the work of Reuben Wu saying “He has been creating great images by using drones with lights attached to them. I gave it a try and found my own way of illuminating foregrounds to obtain better quality in my images.”

I previously wrote about using your drone for photography in ways that don’t require its camera. Gary’s use of lighting with drones inspired one method I pointed out.

How Gary shoots the Abandoned photos

Discussing the origins of the Abandoned series that caught my eye Cummins says “It was a bit of a happy accident to be honest. I was looking for an interesting foreground subject to capture under the night sky and went to a location a friend shared with me not expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised. They have a story to tell. Each one is so different from the other.”

Describing the technical aspects of his drone photography Gary said “We introduce lots of noise in our images in astrophotography shoots and I’ve been trying to find new ways of eliminating that. So I started light painting old houses and barns with my drone. This allowed me to shoot with much lower ISO settings and get cleaner images all around. It is definitely something that changed the game for me.”

This game-changing technique isn’t without its risks: “It does come with its hazards though. Flying at night can be tricky as the drone’s sensors cannot see and it’s also tricky flying around trees.”

Like some of us who get lost in the moment while flying clearly some of Gary’s photos were taken beyond visual line of sight and in dark conditions.

The technical and artistic quality of these images is indisputable. Gary shoots multiple exposures of the foreground structure or vehicle while lighting it with his drone in a grid-like fashion. Next he blends the final images in Photoshop. After that he adds a separately shot image of the sky to composite the end result.

A dream trip to the desert

In November 2019 Cummins was among eight photographers who spent five days travelling through remote parts of Saudi Arabia. His mission was to take photos of never-before-shot locations for @discoverNEOM. He called it “one of the best photographic experiences I’ve had to date. Such an incredible place that I’d like to visit again one day.” The drone photography he captured confirm these words.

The post-COVID outlook

Asked about his future plans Gary said “I’m hosting astrophotography workshops this year. People have become more fascinated with the night sky and have reached out to learn something new.”

Ever positive Gary ended our chat by saying “I’m working on a time/hyper-lapse video at the moment to celebrate my ten years in Canada. While we’re all based close to home I’m thrilled to work on things I’m passionate about. Just having the chance to shoot anything and be creative is something I am so grateful for.”

Keep shooting Gary. We’ll keep an eye out for more of your work and the other on the night sky.

According to a report in Sydney Morning Herald Cummins has already made it clear that he would not be taking part in the remaining matches of the IPL. However there is no reason given behind his decision. ""David Warner and Pat Cummins could be rested from the West Indies tour because of family reasons - others could follow after a draining year in several bubbles - and Cummins despite a multimillion-dollar IPL contract has already said he will not return to the T20 tournament this season"" stated the report.

Earlier Ashley Giles the managing director of the England men's team had said that the England and Wales Cricket (ECB) are not planning to change their schedule for the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2021.

The suspended 14th edition of the IPL is scheduled to be played in UAE in September-October this year with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) confirming the rescheduling of the league on Saturday.

""We are going to have to give some of these guys a break at some point. But the intention of giving guys a break for say Bangladesh wouldn't be for them to go and play cricket elsewhere"" ESPNcricinfo quoted Giles as saying.

""We have to manage our schedule now so we get our guys arriving in the best shape possible for the T20 World Cup and the Ashes"" he added.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Saturday announced it will complete the remaining matches of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2021 season in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

In an official release the board said that the decision to move the tournament to UAE has been taken considering the monsoon season in India in the months of September-October.

Australia and Kolkata Knight Riders speedster Pat Cummins picked four Indians including skipper Virat Kohli as he built his star-studded Test XI ahead of the inaugural World Test Championship (WTC) final in Southampton.

Cummins who has featured in 34 Test matches for and has plucked 164 wickets picked four Australians as well and included a player each from New Zealand England and South Africa in his side.

Currently serving quarantine after arriving from India via the Maldives Cummins spoke to Cricbuzz where he chose Rohit Sharma and David Warner as his Test openers saying that the two can set the tone for other batsmen to play with freedom without any pressure.

Cummins next lined three members from the 'Fab-four' in the batting set-up picking Kane Williamson at the No.3 position and then adding Steve Smith and Kohli. While Smith has 7540 runs in 77 Tests including 27 hundreds Kohli 7490 runs to his name at an average of 52.4.

England star Ben Stokes was the only all-rounder in Cummins' side and the Aussie pacer assigned wicketkeeping duties to India's Rishabh Pant.

On the bowling front Cummins went with India’s Jasprit Bumrah South Africa’s Kagiso Rabada and himself as pace bowling options and finished the XI by picking his teammate Nathan Lyon as the lone spinner.

Notably Cummins currently is the top wicket-taker in the World Test Championship (WTC) having plucked 70 wickets in 14 Test matches. After staying away from the sport for almost a month Cummins will be seen in action when the Aussies fly to West Indies for two white-ball series with first of the five T20 Internationals beginning on July 9. They then follow the T20I series with the ODI series that starts from July 20 to 24.

With the matches likely to be played between September-October the participation of Australian players look doubtful with Pat Cummins pulling out.

Barely a month after the much-hyped 2021 Indian Premier League was called off the Board of Control for Cricket in India announced on Saturday that the tournament remainder would be played in the United Arab Emirates. Although the exact window of the same is yet to be announced it would likely be played between September-October.

While the announcement is a relief for some participating cricketers and the fans it did not seem good news for Australian pacer Pat Cummins who would be skipping the UAE leg for Kolkata Knight Riders. However the reason for the same remains unknown. ""Cummins despite a multi-million dollar IPL contract has already said he will not return to the T20 tournament this season"" a Sydney Morning Herald report quoted.

Meanwhile Cricket Australia is pondering on the entire scenario and would be taking a call in the next few days to allow its players to take part in the second leg of IPL 2021. It is being presumed that workload management of the Aussies is an issue.

Furthermore the tough bio-bubble life ahead of the ICC World T20 2021 likely to be held in India between October and November is forcing CA to think upon it. Nevertheless IPL 2021 would be a crucial platform for the players to get suited to the sub-continent conditions ahead of the WT20.

ALSO READ: IPL 2021 remainder may begin from September 15 ICC World T20 could be limited to one city- Sources

""CA will need to decide whether it's in the best mental health interests of its players to spend even more time in a bio-secure bubble. CA could decide the IPL will ensure players are fine-tuned for the World Cup which could also be held in the UAE"" the report added.

Besides Australia the availability of English players could also become an issue. England is supposed to have a busy international schedule starting June while Ashley Giles (Director of Cricket - England and Wales Cricket Board) has already hinted that most of the players look set to miss out.

The BCCI has no other window available to finish off IPL 2021. Furthermore it is unlikely that the International Cricket Council is looking to rejig the WT20 dates or poke nose into the matters of IPL and the bilateral tours. However ICC would undoubtedly monitor the situation including the IPL 2021 in UAE as the challenging situation in India currently surrounding the lethal second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic could force the tournament to be shifted to the gulf as well.

A recent study compared disease characteristics quality of life (QoL) and work productivity of patients with PsA who had disease activity in those 6 areas compared with a single area.

The researchers said they undertook the study because there have been limited real-world studies examining disease domain in these patients. In addition the right treatment may be influenced by the mix of frequency type and severity of the different disease domains they pointed out.

Using the Corrona PsA/Spondyloarthritis (PsA/SpA) Registry a large independent prospective observational cohort of individuals with PsA or SpA the researchers recruited patients from 44 private and academic practice sites across 27 states.

As of June 30 2019 data on 3939 patients with PsA/SpA had been collected. The Corrona PsA/SpA Registry includes information on 15806 patient visits with approximately 8423 patient-years of follow-up with a mean time of patient follow-up of 2.9 years (median 2.4 years).

Adults with PsA enrolled in the registry from March 2013 to August 2018 were included in the study; they were classified as having multidomain (≥ 2 domains) or single-domain disease presentations.

Of 2617 patients with PsA 1698 (64.9%) had multidomain presentations 617 (23.6%) had single-domain presentations and 302 (11.5%) had no active disease features.

The researchers characterized patients who began biologic treatment at study enrollment separately. Of 354 patients 289 (81.6%) had multidomain presentations 45 (12.7%) had single-domain presentations and 20 (5.6%) had no active disease features.

For those on biologics with single-domain vs multidomain presentations the mean (SD) ages were 52.5 (12.7) vs 51.5 (13.2) years respectively. Roughly half in each group were female (47.7% and 52.2%).

Patients on biologics and multidomain presentations were more likely to have nail psoriasis depression psoriasis and current use of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs than patients on biologics with single-domain presentations.

Overall the most common single-domain and multidomain presentations respectively were skin disease (12.7%) and PsA plus skin disease (11.7%).

Perhaps not surprisingly patients with multidomain disease were more likely to have fibromyalgia depression anxiety and prior biologic use than single-domain presenters.

Multidomain presentations were associated with significantly worse patient and physician global assessments of disease activity pain and fatigue; Health Assessment Questionnaire–Disability Index and EuroQol-5 Dimension scores; and work productivity at enrollment.

The study had some limitations such as the fact that the patient population was limited to the United States and disease domains were reported by physicians.

""These results highlight the wide spectrum of disease presentations among patients with PsA"" the authors concluded. ""Evaluation of the active disease domains is important for the development of an effective disease management plan.""

Unruly twins Phil and Lil's mother Betty DeVille has been rewritten as openly gay in the new episodes.

Dead to Me actress Natalie Morales is taking over the role from Kath Soucie who was the original voice of Betty and said the character is now a really good example for young queer people who may not have any other characters like her on television to look up to.

""Anyone who watched the original show may have had an inkling Betty was a member of the alphabet mafia"" Morales said in a statement.

""Betty is a single mom with her own business who has twins and still has time to hang out with her friends and her community and I think it's just so great because examples of living your life happily and healthily as an out queer person is just such a beacon for young queer people who may not have examples of that.""

""And yeah Betty is a fictional cartoon but even cartoons were hugely influential for me as a kid and if I'd been watching Rugrats and seen Betty casually talking about her ex-girlfriend I think at least a part of me would have felt like things might be okay in the future.""

The Sex and The City star on Thursday tweeted that it saddened her to see the products behind glass and said prosecuting poor people was not the solution.

Yet Vincent the manager of the SoHo CVS close to Nixon's $3.2 million apartment said she was not living in the real world.

'Miss Cynthia Nixon I don't think you understand what is going on' he told DailyMail.com

'If you feel that way maybe one day you should come here and see what we go through.

'Because people are in danger too - they come in here and start with customers and they start with the people here that work.'

Vincent who manages Cynthia Nixon's local CVS in SoHo said that the Sex and the City actress was unrealistic to ask for the locks on products in his store to be removed. He said the shelves were regularly raided with people carting away backpacks full of items which were then sold on to local bodegas

CVS has for years put many of its small pricey and easy-to-steal items behind clear plastic cages. To buy customers must call a shop attendant who arrives with a key to unlock the desired shelf

Nixon in a recent Zoom appearance. She lives in $3.2million apartment in SoHo one of Manhattan's most expensive neighborhoods and on Thursday complained about her local CVS pharmacy

Vincent said he had no choice but to lock away some of the most valuable and easily-stolen products such as pricey skincare creams toothpastes detergent and cosmetics because they were regularly stolen and resold to bodegas.

He said the scale of the theft was shocking.

'The main reason why we are doing lockdown is because it's not a petty crime any more' he said.

'They are going above and beyond and taking shelves. They are putting it in knapsacks and taking everything.'

He told Nixon that he has sympathy for those New Yorkers suffering financially but said he did not believe those stealing were doing it because they are hungry.

'The empathy for the people I have - if they take one item I'm not going to stop them' he said.

'But they clear shelves.

'It's not about them surviving to eat. It's about getting money to buy drugs.'

Vincent managed this SoHo branch of CVS which is closest to Cynthia Nixon's home which she shares with her wife and their three children

The SoHo store is in one of the most affluent areas of Manhattan and attracted thieves with backpacks waiting to empty the shelves

Small expensive creams for the face and hands were among the most prized objects for thieves Vincent said because they can easily be stolen and sold on

Toothpaste which is always behind lock and key is another item which Vincent said is sought-after by thieves in his store

The products are stolen and sold at local bodegas he said

Vincent said that locking away some of the products was for the good of all customers who did not want to be confronted by empty shelves pillaged by looters.

'I just want the people out there to know that we try to keep a safe environment so when people come out to shop there are items on the shelves. Not stolen. And that's what it's all about' he said.

'We try to keep it safe and be courteous to everyone. Including the people who come in to steal.

'I hope this gets out there.

'This CVS is not about locking down and not giving to the customers.

'It's about making sure the items are still on the shelves for them to buy.'

The actress and failed New York gubernatorial candidate tweeted on Thursday that she had noticed her local CVS in SoHo had 'started' locking up 'basic items like clothing detergent.'

'As so many families can’t make ends meet right now I can’t imagine thinking that the way to solve the problem of people stealing basic necessities out of desperation is to prosecute them' Nixon tweeted.

She was condemned by people who said the solution was not to invite theft. CVS Walgreens and Duane Reade have been locking up items for years to deter thieves amid a widespread decriminalization of shoplifting.

Nixon was responding to a tweet which pointed out that several Manhattan DA and Mayoral candidates say they would not prosecute shoplifting because it 'criminalizes poverty'.

Critics said her tweet pointed to how irregularly she visited the stores which have been locking things up since long before the pandemic began.

Vincent said that he has sympathy for those in need but he did not believe those stealing from his store were taking food for themselves or their families. He said it was to resell the goods and buy drugs

The CVS manager said he would not stop someone from stealing food that they desperately needed but he had to prevent his shelves from being ransacked

Vincent said taking items out of their locked cases would encourage a free-for-all and mean there was nothing left on the shelves for his genuine customers

CVS is not the only store to employ such tactics. Walgreens Duane Reade and Rite Aid all keep some of their products locked behind plastic cases

Her comment about CVS on Thursday came as Governor Andrew Cuomo warned of the escalating crime rate in New York City which has become so high he said New Yorkers no longer feel safe.

Crime in New York City soared by 30 per cent this week compared to the same week last year and robberies were 70 per cent higher.

Cuomo warned that if it doesn't settle soon it'll hamper New York's economic recovery from COVID.

Over the past four weeks murders in the city are up 67 per cent from 27 in the same period last year to 45.

Rapes are up 25 per cent robberies 54 per cent. Shootings have risen by a staggering 130 per cent.

Shoppers told DailyMail.com that the restrictions certainly made their lives a little more complicated but they fully understood why stores needed to keep products inside locked cases

Small tubs of body creams and facial moisturizers were attractive targets for thieves

Vincent said he locked the products up out of necessity

Last spring in a bid to slow the transmission of the virus the city started housing thousands of homeless people in hotel rooms left empty as tourists fled.

Mayor Bill de Blasio is expected to end that program at the end of June. Then those people will be back on the streets.

Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr. is so concerned he is calling for a commission 'that reaches beyond law enforcement and the justice system to gather the information necessary to issue evidence-based recommendations on all local problems that implicate safety and justice-involvement for New Yorkers from housing to mental health to bail' he wrote in an op-ed in the New York Daily News.

So far this year shooting incidents in the city are up 82 percent from last year and murders are 22 percent from last year and 45 percent from 2019 levels.

In total in 2021 there have been 32695 major crimes reported. There have been nearly 400 more major crimes reported this week in New York than there were in the same week last year - a surge in 30 per cent.

One shopper at CVS told DailyMail.com she found the locking up of products irritating but understandable given the crime.

'It annoys me if I come to CVS and anything I want to grab and go is locked up' she said.

'But I get it. Otherwise it's grab and go.

'It hurts me that so many people struggle to get by.

'I want my CVS open of course. I want them to stay in business.'

The woman who lived in SoHo and owned a business said crime in the city she has called home for the past 20 years was almost as bad as the 1980s.

'It's terrible' she said.

'I've seen things... It's been 20 years I've lived here. It's like the 80s.

'I have a business in the neighborhood. We cannot leave the door of our business open. We lock the door and buzz people up.

'I don't wear my nice watch to work. In the subway I'm nervous. I don't ride with a fancy handbag. I have a fabric tote.

'I don't really recall of being aware of not making myself noticed until recently. It's not even during the pandemic - it's lately.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiuwFodHRwczovL2pvdXJuYWxzdGFyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2NyaW1lLWNvdXJ0cy90aGV5LXJlLWFsbC10cmVzcGFzc2luZy1pbnNpZGUtbGF3LWVuZm9yY2VtZW50cy1vLXN0cmVldC1kZXRhaWwtb3Zlci1tZW1vcmlhbC1kYXktd2Vla2VuZC9hcnRpY2xlX2VlMTVjNTBkLTg4N2QtNTFhOC1iYjBhLWNiYzQ1ODhlNjE3My5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'They're all trespassing' — Inside law enforcement's O Street detail over Memorial Day weekend,"Shortly after 8 p.m. Friday near the corner of 48th and O streets where the Lincoln Police Department had set up a command post for its Memorial Day weekend traffic enforcement detail Sgt. Angela Sands was at the beginning of what was sure to be a long night.

The group of LPD officers and Nebraska State Patrol troopers had just finished a briefing in the CVS Pharmacy parking lot.

Their location was strategic Sands said as the intersection and parking lot are ""where most of the bad things happen"" when the thousands of mostly well-intentioned onlookers converge on O Street annually to watch an informal parade of classic cars.

In recent years crowds of more than 5000 people have gathered in the pharmacy’s parking lot Sands said and some attendees have rushed into O Street to pour water on the tires of cars doing burnouts to create larger smoke clouds.

Others have thrown bottles at officers who perform traffic stops on the city’s primary east-west street.

The traffic light at the intersection coupled with a pair of turning lanes provides a stage large enough and a time slot long enough for cars to perform burnouts while spectators egg them on.

So before crowds of people could converge on the lot officers took it over themselves and braced for the weekend as hundreds of observers filled the lots of other private businesses up and down O Street as the sun set.

“You see all the people in the parking lots?” Sands said over the roar of revving engines pointing across the street to people lining the lots of Walgreens Runza and AT&T. “They’re all trespassing.”

As Sands explained the ordinances most attendees were violating a team of officers mobilized to enforce the law.

Eight blocks to the east Officer Luke Bonkiewicz was on foot making his way from the Arby’s on 56th Street back toward LPD’s command post at CVS.

By 8:50 p.m. he had made his way past Cheddar’s a real estate office a mobile network operator and a Scooter’s Coffee shop using a polite plainspoken approach as he asked onlookers to clear their cars from the businesses.

Bonkiewicz repeated phrases like “Sorry to bother you” and he leaned on the word “folks.” Some groups asked him to cite the ordinance they were violating. Some groups thanked him even as he requested they leave. One offered him a cookie they’d bought at Hy-Vee.

“Most people are very decent” Bonkiewicz said. “Most people in Lincoln are decent folks they’re just hard-working folks who just want to enjoy it. There’s 10% of the people who — maybe it’s drugs alcohol whatever it is — but most people are amazing.”

And most people complied. As he crossed 52nd Street and neared the parking lot of Barnes & Noble Bonkiewicz had left largely empty lots in his wake.

It had taken him more than 20 minutes to walk from Arby’s to CVS stopping in every lot except for Staples — the only business in the stretch he said that LPD hadn’t made contact with prior to Friday night. His walking tour seemed to have worked.

“Well” Bonkiewicz said drawing out the one-syllable word. “It’s temporarily effective.”

Within 20 minutes of his initial sweep the same lots he cleared had filled again. Hy-Vee. Barnes & Noble. Scooters. As if Bonkiewicz had never been there.

At 52nd Street where Fresh Thyme once operated the onlookers who had asked Bonkiewicz to cite the ordinance requiring them to leave were now standing closer to the street pouring water on the asphalt encouraging drivers to perform burnouts. A red pickup truck obliged.

By 9:41 p.m. Bonkiewicz was nearing 56th Street again — this time on the other side of O Street in front of Palm Beach Tan.

He planned to patrol until 2 a.m. Four hours to go.

* * *

Back at CVS Sands and Sgt. Brad Junker met inside the police department’s command post that resembled a UPS truck. It was nearing 10 p.m. and the officers were reflecting on what they’d learned in the last two hours as they prepared for the next four.

“Wherever we go” Junker said “they just move.”

With their usual gathering spot now occupied by the city’s police department the largest crowd had moved east. The former Fresh Thyme lot — where Bonkiewicz had already been — became the night’s flashpoint. Sands said the enforcement detail had expected that.

But a portion of the department’s plan had failed. Sands expected crowds to gather at CVS despite the police presence giving officers a chance to educate onlookers and prevent dangerous behavior from breaking out altogether.

Instead spectators had fled the intersection. But Sands said the night had still mostly been on par with what she expected in her first year quarterbacking the O Street operation.

In two hours there hadn’t been any reported accidents or injuries. The crowd was smaller than Sands guessed it would be. The temperature was dropping. The sun had disappeared.

“The biggest difference now that the sun’s down is those neat classic cars are going home for the night” Junker said. “What we’re gonna be left with are the folks that want to turn this into a drag strip.”

A new batch of officers started their shifts. The O Street detail switched to its own radio frequency and was assigned its own dispatcher. Sands texted with the State Patrol helicopter pilot who was on standby waiting for orders from the sergeant.

Outside the air smelled of burned rubber. The intersection where Sands had decided to set up shop was quieter than it’d been in previous years. Still it was plagued by a cloud of smoke."

Danaher has made appearances on the ‘JRE’ podcast in the past as Rogan is a practitioner in his own right. John Danaher considered to be a visionary in the Jiu-Jitsu space has made his mark training legends.

When going over the nuances in the sport Rogan commented on the core value outlook that makes Jiu-Jitsu viable i.e. submissions. John Danaher expanded on the idea and suggested that a renewed focus should be placed on securing the submission during competition. Danaher posited that a diversion from this goal of securing a submission into simply scoring points was watering down the sport.

“What makes [Jiu-Jitsu] remarkable is the idea that it’s a form of grappling where the outcome is determined in a way which it’s understandable to anyone- it’s surrender. You make someone surrender to you. As impressive as Judo wrestling are as sports the mechanism by which they win in Judo’s case the Ippon throw…and in wrestling a pin they’re not as decisive…..But when you surrender that’s you saying ‘I quit it’s over’. That’s the most definitive form of victory in any form of grappling.”

“The further you get away from the idea that Jiu-Jitsu is about controlling into submission the less interesting the sport becomes. We must do as much as possible to push athletes towards that expression of Jiu-Jitsu. Don’t just win by the minimum amount to get the job done. But go the extra distance and try to win by submission.”

Combat Jiu-Jitsu: The way forward

Unlike other high octane combat sports like MMA and boxing submission grappling is tailored to a more niche audience. The sport doesn’t garner large casual mainstream attention. This is much in part because of the complexities of the sport itself.

However by prioritizing submissions instead of focusing on point-style fighting Jiu-Jitsu competitions may attract a larger audience. ‘Submission Underground’ one such platform that has taken off in recent years follows a more aggressive format.

Not to mention when UFC fighters like Jon Jones vs Dan Henderson in a grappling exchange fans’ interest is piqued.

The opportunity for a small-town farm equipment dealer came after a previous owner shut closed the doors of a pre-existing dealership. Rod Larson and other local farmers recognized the importance of getting the proper service for their equipment when needed. They also wanted to provide more opportunity and become a part of greater communities so they joined forces and resurrected what is now known as Green Iron Equipment. Green Iron Equipment began in April 2000 with two locations in LaMoure and Ellendale and has since grown to six branches servicing Southeast North Dakota and Northeast South Dakota.

The business offers a full line of new and used but not limited to John Deere agricultural equipment as well as Sales Parts Service and Integrated Solutions departments. The business also carries the latest in skid steers lawnmowers snowblower and other consumer products.

“Choosing John Deere was easy"" Larson said. ""In my books they were No. 1 in the year 2000 and they still are today.""

Larson said he enjoys being a part of the Green Iron team and hearing from satisfied customers noting that is a reflection on the services the employees are providing.

""To them I say keep up the good work. And thank you to our loyal customers for helping us keep the lights on for 20 years” he said.

Green Iron Equipment began with four employees and now employs over 100. It is located in Ashley Ellendale LaMoure Milnor and Napoleon in North Dakota and Britton South Dakota.

In March Green Iron Equipment celebrated its 20 years with a weeklong event with a different theme for each day. Monday was “Kids’ Coloring Creations” where kids colored a picture from their website in exchange for a mini toy tractor. Each store put the kids’ artwork on display in the showrooms. On Tuesday and Thursday they gave away multiple items such as blankets hats coffee mugs coolers T-shirts and water bottles. Wednesday’s theme was “Buy a Tool Give a Tool” where they pledged to match any tools purchased that day and donate them to a high school ag/shop class of the customers’ choice. Nine schools received donations on behalf of customers. On Friday they had a grand prize drawing.

Find out here Bob Vila’s picks for the best riding lawn mowers.

Spring is in full swing and summer is just around the corner. For many that change in the weather signifies the need for a new riding lawn mower. But if you’re unsure of which lawn mower to pick? We recommend checking out Bob Vila’s picks for the best riding lawn mowers. Let’s find out what they are.

The Cub Cadet XT1 LT is the best riding lawn mower

According to Bob Vila there’s a lot to like about the Cub Cadet XT1 LT. It comes equipped with a powerful 24-hp twin-cylinder Kohler engine and features a 50-inch cutting deck making it the best riding lawn mower for lawns up to 1.5 acres. With three cutting blades and 12 easily adjustable cutting heights this riding lawn mower’s cutting deck provides more than enough cutting power too Bob Villa reports.

This mower also boasts features like cruise control and a SmartDeck jet wash system which lets you attach a garden hose to the mowing deck so that you can rinse out the interior of the mower. As for how much this riding lawn mower costs? According to Home Depot you can expect to spend roughly $2199 on the Cub Cadet XT1 LT.

The Troy-Bilt Pony riding lawn mower gives you the best bang for your buck

Perhaps you’re not looking to spend that much on a new lawn mower. Instead you would prefer a more affordable riding lawn mower for under $2000. If that’s the case Bob Vila reports that the Troy-Bilt Pony will give you the most bang for your buck. Priced at $1349 it’s also significantly cheaper than the Cub Cadet XT1 LT.

The good news is that its cheaper price tag doesn’t mean that this riding lawn mower makes any compromises when it comes to features. In fact according to Bob Vila this affordable riding lawn mower benefits from features like a twin-blade deck that offers more than enough cutting power a seven-speed shift-on-the-go transmission and an 18-inch turning radius. It also comes equipped with LED headlights and an integrated washing port.

Upgrade to the Cub Cadet Ultima ZT2 for one of the best riding lawn mowers

For a high-performance zero-turn lawn mower Bob Vila suggests taking a look at the Cub Cadet Ultima ZT2. Priced at $4299 this zero-turn riding lawn mower comes equipped with a 24- Kawasaki twin-cylinder motor and a 3.5-gallon gas tank. It also boasts a 60-inch deck and can mow lawns that are three acres or bigger. It can also reach speeds of up to 7.5 mph.

Bob Vila reports that this zero-turn mower is pretty comfortable too. It features a cushioned seat with armrests along with comfortable hand grips. It also comes outfitted with LED headlights so that you can mow your lawn even in lowlight conditions.

The John Deere E120 is one of the best lawn tractors to buy

Now this one should come as no surprise. After all John Deere is well-known for having some of the best riding lawn mowers out there. But when it comes to the best one that you can buy? Bob Vila suggests going with the John Deere E120.

This riding lawn mower features a 20-hp V-twin engine along with a 42-inch deck. According to Bob Vila this particular John Deere riding lawn mower is best suited for lawns up to 1.5 acres. Its deck also has multiple height adjustments and an 18-inch turning radius that makes navigating around trees and gardens easier than ever. As for how much the John Deere E120 costs? You can expect to spend about $2100 on this riding lawn mower.

Pick the Toro TimeCutter commercial mower for the best zero-turn lawn mower

For those looking to save time cutting their lawn the Toro TimeCutter might just be the perfect fit. This zero-turn riding lawn mower is driven by a 22.5-hp engine that can reach up to 7 mph. Overall Bob Vila reports that this mower is among the best riding lawn mowers for cutting lawns up to two acres.

Those aren’t the only reason to consider this zero-turn lawn mower either. Bob Vila reports that this $2879 lawn mower knows just how to please when it comes to features. In fact chances are you’ll find yourself enjoying features like an under-seat storage cubby and multiple cup holders when mowing your lawn with this zero-turn mower.

The best riding lawn mowers for small and big yards according to Bob Vila

Now say your yard is bigger than three acres. If that’s the case Bob Villa suggests a Toro TimeCutter with a 54-inch deck. This mower is equipped with a 24.5-hp twin gas engine and features a plush high back seat with armrests to keep you comfortable. The bad news is that this mower is on the more expensive side of things. In fact opting for this riding lawn mower will have you spending approximately $4199.

And if you’re in the market for the best lawn mower for small yards instead? Consider the Ryobi 30 in. 50Ah electric rear engine riding lawn mower. This electric lawn mower is among the best lawn mowers for small yards and charges via a standard 120-volt outlet. Choose this lawn mower and you can expect to spend about $2449.

Choosing the best riding lawn mower doesn’t need to be stressful

Shopping for a lawn mower takes time effort and research. But with these picks in hand? Choosing the best riding lawn mower for your yard doesn’t need to be a stressful endeavor. Instead when shopping for your next lawn mower we suggest keeping these picks in mind.",,,

There’s an emphasis on premium product coming out of the recent challenging period. Delta believes that by offering customers more they can get customers to spend more on premium products which are “higher margin.”

But what if they’re achieving that margin by claiming to offer a premium product but they’re really offering something you can buy at 7-11?

I was genuinely surprised by reports about the complimentary champagne being served this past week at Delta’s Sky Clubs. They used to serve Veuve du Vernay which is inexpensive but at least proper champagne. However this week we saw the appearance in Atlanta of Cooks.

According to Delta spokesperson Drake Castaneda “Veuve du Vernay has and will remain our complimentary sparkling wine selection at Delta Sky Clubs.” It appears though that individual clubs are currently offering the cheapest and most available bottles they can find like when the airline was pouring predeparture Andre in international business class.

Cooks and Andre both are sold at 7-11 (Some would argue that Andre is better than Cooks.)

Perhaps Delta just considers themselves to be the premium carrier because they offer bubbles at no extra charge in their lounges. In contrast American Airlines continues to offer its Veloce red and white “exclusive label from Bobby Stuckey” but no complimentary champagne. These are the same options as before the pandemic



American Airlines House Red and White

And American Airlines in fact no longer engages wine expert Bobby Stuckey. That relationship appears to have been a victim of the pandemic (he was the their latest Ken Chase). American’s wine program is currently outsourced to Intervine. Spokesperson Leah Rubertino tells me “Later this year we’ll have more to come on what’s next for our wine program. We really enjoyed working with Bobby he picked some great wines!”

United for its part dispenses with the champagne for its ‘no upcharge’ offering and offers Mionetto Prosecco instead along with Camelot Red and White.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZGVsdGEtZmlyc3QtY2xhc3MtdXBncmFkZXMtZWFzaWVyLW5vLW1pZGRsZS1zZWF0LWJsb2NrLTIwMjEtNdIBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZGVsdGEtZmlyc3QtY2xhc3MtdXBncmFkZXMtZWFzaWVyLW5vLW1pZGRsZS1zZWF0LWJsb2NrLTIwMjEtNT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta first class upgrades are easier to get with no middle seat block,"I arrived at the airport the next morning with no confirmed upgrade for the first flight even though I was still in good standing on the upgrade list.

Not only do SkyMiles members get a bigger route network but they are now also able to earn and redeem miles on Cape Air flights.

As an added incentive Delta is offering 500 bonus SkyMiles on all Cape Air flights flown by Aug. 31 2021. This bonus is pretty substantial considering some Cape Air flights can be booked for as little as 5000 SkyMiles each way.

Cape Air mostly serves smaller airports catering to leisure travelers. The timing of the announcement is perfect considering we're a few weeks away from the busy summer travel season. Depending on where you're traveling you may get three or more cents per mile in value from redemptions on one of these routes.

Cape Air routes

Cape Air is currently operating 11 flights out of Boston:

Augusta Maine (AUG)

Bar Harbor Maine (BHB)

Hyannis Massachussetts (HYA)

Lebanon N.H. (LEB)

Martha's Vineyard Mass. (MVY)

Nantucket Massachusetts (ACK)

Portland Maine (PWM)

Provincetown Massachusetts (PVC)

Rockland Maine (RKD)

Rutland Vt. (RUT)

Saranac Lake N.Y. (SLK)

Booking Cape Air flights with Delta SkyMiles

Cape Air flights can be booked for as little as 5000 SkyMiles even during the busy summer travel season. The key to booking these low fares is to be flexible. Use the calendar function on Delta.com for a monthly overview and if you're able to plan your trip around the lowest fares.

Keep in mind that Delta utilizes dynamic pricing so redemption rates change based on demand. To give you an idea of what you can expect in terms of redemptions let's look at the Boston (BOS) - Martha's Vineyard (MVY) route. A one-way ticket on this Cape Air route in early June starts $179 per person.

(Screenshot of Capeair.com)

The same flight starts at 5000 SkyMiles and $12 in taxes and fees. TPG values SkyMiles at 1.1 cents each. On a booking like this you would get almost four cents in value out of each SkyMile. That just goes to show that you don't always have to travel in premium cabins to get maximum value out of your miles.

It's worthwhile to compare Delta's award rates against Cape Air competitors. For example the BOS-MVY route is also operated by JetBlue. Using the airline's Best Fare Finder you can see the lowest rates in June are 6900 TrueBlue points each way. Taxes are just $5.60.

(Screenshot courtesy of JetBlue.com)

While Delta's lowest redemption rate is less than JetBlue's you may want to redeem TrueBlue points on dates when Delta's Cape Air fares skyrocket to 100000 miles each way.

Bottom line

Delta's partnership with Cape Air opens up more routes where SkyMiles members can earn and redeem miles. With fares starting at just 5000 SkyMiles each way Delta beats out competitors like JetBlue on some of these routes. With a very small number of airlines offering service to Cape Air destinations like Martha's Vineyard it's nice to have another airline to earn and redeem miles with.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3RyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtdHJhdmVsLzIwMjEvMDUvMzAvZGVsdGEtbGF1bmNoZXMtaXBhLWZvcm11bGF0ZWQtc3BlY2lmaWNhbGx5LXRvLWJlLWVuam95ZWQtYXQtMzUwMDAtZmVldC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta launches IPA “formulated specifically to be enjoyed at 35000 feet” – Business Traveller,"Delta has launched a new inflight IPA in partnership with Atlanta-based SweetWater Brewing Company.

The carrier said that the Elevated H.A.Z.Y. IPA is a “reimagination of the acclaimed SweetWater H.A.Z.Y. IPA tweaked so the same great experience customers have on the ground can now be enjoyed in the air”.

Delta said that the special brew “introduces new and more hops to the beer during the dry-hopping process giving the already flavourful H.A.Z.Y. IPA more pronounced aroma that complements a smooth and creamy mouthfeel” adding that “At 35000 feet this added punch of citrus helps to balance the bitter and sweet combination of the beer and overcomes the ways smell and taste are otherwise subdued by altitude and humidity level”.

The beer will be available on US domestic routes starting this Memorial Day Weekend.

Brian Miesieski chief marketing officer at SweetWater said that the team had been “brainstorming a special collaboration brew for some time but when Delta’s chefs approached us about adjusting a beer to account for tastebud sensitivity at higher altitudes we knew we had something special”.

“The teams tasted and tested many different formulations onboard to ensure the recipe was perfect” continued Miesieski . “Then we brought in our creative teams to design a unique can for the new brew that embodies the theme for this one-of-a-kind IPA. We are proud of our long-standing partnership with Delta which is built on the shared vision of offering moments of delight.”

Delta is not the first carrier to launch a beer designed to drunk inflight. In 2019 British Airways launched The Speedbird 100 IPA in partnership with Scottish craft brewery Brewdog – a beer “specifically brewed to work perfectly in the air and adapt to the reduction in taste and smell sensitivity at high altitudes”.

Delta recently reintroduced its onboard snack and drinks service with new single serve cans replacing poured beverages.

Today they can hardly bear to look.

A sea of glinting solar panels stretches out bank upon bank across the fields surrounding the village of Pancrasweek near Bude.

The solar farm by the Darwins' house is one of six within a three-mile radius and many locals already feel like prisoners in this new landscape of security fences warning signs and cameras.

Worse there is another one planned just a few fields away – a monster which at 164 acres would be the biggest in the county.

'I am very green but these schemes are not green at all' says Heather. 'They are all about money.

'Aside from looking at those hideous panels our lives will be dominated by acres of metal glass CCTV and generator boxes.

It has been calculated that most UK solar farms including those in Devon (pictured) will never get beyond 12 per cent of their true generating capacity in the course of a year due to the cloudy British weather

'It's not the country life I'd imagined I would retire to.'

Across Britain solar farms are on the march.

Some 1000 acres of rural land a month are earmarked for 'photovoltaic' panels and the miles of cabling that go with them.

The Government admits that more than a fifth of our farmland will eventually be lost to 'green' initiatives such as these.

Last week The Mail on Sunday counted 270 solar farms under construction or waiting for planning permission around the country.

Environmental lobbyists argue that solar energy is a crucial part of a sustainable future but they talk less about the growing doubts raised by scientists and angry groups of residents.

Christian Darwin and his wife Heather on their Scotland Farm in the Devon countryside which they say is being blighted by 'hideous' solar panels

Because apart from ruining the view solar panels are also woefully inefficient at their only job – which is to generate electricity amid the cloud and rain of north-west Europe.

Then there is the question of disposal.

The materials the panels are made with have a life expectancy of less than 50 years and are difficult and expensive to recycle raising the prospect of discarded panel mountains leaking dangerous heavy metals.

And with the majority of panels now made in China there are fears – all too plausible – that some have been produced in forced labour camps including those where members of the oppressed Uighur minority are imprisoned.

'A power supply that is always both unpredictable and intermittent is not sensible' says Christopher Darwin.

'In a few years' time if winter power cuts increase as expected people will wonder why solar industrial sites in the countryside were considered anything other than expensive white elephants.'

The protesters have been joined by actor and local resident John Nettles who keeps a smallholding nearby.

Best known for roles in Bergerac and Midsomer Murders today Nettles features in a video which lambasts the spread of solar farms and in particular the proposed mega-development near the village of Pyworthy.

'Enough is enough' he says. 'People need to understand the enormous scale and visual impact.

'The giant new project at Derril Water would desecrate the pastoral vista in this part of Devon turning it into an industrialised landscape of solar panels and security fencing.

'It would ruin 164 acres of pasture for at least 40 years. Decision-makers… have failed to take into account the carbon footprint of manufacturing 76000 solar panels on the other side of the world transported and installed here.

'They are simply not low-carbon.'

So unsuitable is the British weather it has been calculated that most UK solar farms will never get beyond 12 per cent of their true generating capacity in the course of a year.

Solar energy contributed a measly seven per cent of National Grid power last month even though April was unusually sunny and dry.

In December the solar contribution was a pathetic 0.67 per cent of the total.

Dr Benny Peiser director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) think-tank says solar energy makes no sense in this country and the many miles of panelling are likely to do more harm than good.

'There is simply not enough sun' he says.

'Perhaps in the Sahara where no one lives having these huge tens of miles of solar panels may make sense.

'But in Britain I'm concerned about the unintended consequences.

'You would need to carpet about five per cent of Britain's entire land in solar panels to generate enough energy to keep things working – and that's only in the day.

'Obviously they don't work at night. They leave a huge ecological footprint.

'A single nuclear power plant sits on a square kilometre or so of land.

'For solar panels to generate the equivalent energy you'd need 10000 times more space – maybe even more.'

Relatively sunny at least in British terms the South West has been particularly affected.

The Devon branch of the CPRE (formerly known as the Campaign to Protect Rural England) says that nearly 4300 acres of Devon farmland have already been lost to solar development.

'When does it stop? When there are no fields left for sheep cattle or wildlife?' asks Penny Mills director of Devon CPRE.

John Nettles of Midsomer Murders fame features in a video which lambasts the spread of solar farms and in particular the proposed mega-development near the village of Pyworthy

'Tourism is vital to our economy. But do holidaymakers come to visit industrial landscapes or pretty green countryside?

'These rural parishes are defined by livestock grazing and grassland with little quiet lanes.

'The proposed 164-acre site would devastate habitats for endangered bird species including bullfinches fieldfares redwings skylarks and yellowhammers.

'We fear the landscape will vanish under a sea of glass and metal.'

Another installation near the Darwins The Derriton Fields Solar Farm is a case in point.

At 35 acres it is relatively small. But with its 10ft-high metal fence closed-circuit cameras and countless warning signs it looked more like an American prison compound when The Mail on Sunday paid a visit.

The 60-acre Crinacott Solar Farm just a mile to the south west was no more appealing.

Solar developers like to claim that sheep can graze alongside the rows of panels but at Crinacott the grass cannot grow in the permanent shadows cast by the panels.

There were no sheep and the only noise was the low humming from electrical transformers.

This could soon be the future for the fields at Derril Water too.

Fury erupted this week over a proposed solar plant in Dorset which would be equivalent in size to 150 Wembley Stadiums with some 150000 panels covering fields of green land

At present they offer both primeval 'culm' grassland – which provides tussocky grazing for sheep – and good-quality pasture for beef and dairy cattle.

But we also saw two men using what appeared to be ground-penetrating radar which suggests the cattle's days on the open farmland there are numbered.

Yet the sheer expense of dealing with old panels is a significant problem for the future.

The first models were built to last for about 20 years (although newer panels last longer) which means that many British solar farms are already well towards needing replacements.

Quite what will happen when the panels are decommissioned is unclear not least because they contain toxic substances including cadmium.

Dr Peiser says this is already a danger in countries where solar energy was adopted earlier.

'Often old panels are not recycled just dumped' he says.

'Dig a hole dump them cover the hole. The countries with a lot of sun particularly in the developing world don't have the recycling facilities. And they don't really care.

'In the UK we don't have a big problem yet because the solar panel boom started only about ten to 15 years ago.

'The real problem will happen in a few years when they are no longer efficient and have to come down. These issues haven't been fully thought through.'

The panels themselves are cheap mainly because Chinese factories account for 75 per cent of global manufacture. But there are ethical problems.

An investigation earlier this month claimed that up to 40 per cent of the UK's solar farms use panels made by Chinese companies accused of using labour supplied by prison camps in Xinjiang province home to the Uighurs.

According to The Guardian these Chinese firms have connections with some of the UK's largest solar companies.

Developers on the picturesque North Kent coast revealed plans last year to line 900 acres of farmland with solar panels a larger green space than New York's Central park

These include the Foresight Group which owns Pitworthy Solar Farm next to the Darwins' land.

Foresight pointed to a statement by trade association Solar Energy UK's that the industry condemns any abuse of human rights in the supply chain.

Direct Government subsidies for solar farms were abandoned in 2019 (although earlier lucrative agreements are still in force).

But rents from solar farms far outstrip the precarious profits from conventional agriculture with Devon landowners reportedly earning up to £2000 an acre every year from solar.

Some sheep farmers in the county are said to earn as little as £6 an acre

This gulf is only likely to get bigger thanks to the Government's 'Net Zero By 2050' initiative according to Dr John Constable director of the Renewable Energy Foundation.

Hard-pressed farmers have realised that they can make a profit – and are rushing to take advantage.

'The net-zero drive is so insensitive to cost and environmental damage a lot of very strange things are happening' says Dr Constable.

'The brakes are completely off. It's an unrestrained area of the economy. We're preparing to lose a large part of British farmland to a second-rate electricity scheme.

'We've got a growing population so within a couple of decades we'll be 50 per cent dependent on imported food.

'Is that a sensible way of using a finite resource especially post-Brexit? It's a very odd thing to do.'

Plans to build a 190 acre solar farm on countryside that inspired legendary novelist Thomas Hardy were met with a protest in Dorset this week

There could be worse to come.

Thanks to a loophole in the planning system Dr Constable believes solar farms are a good way for developers to turn lower-grade farmland into 'brownfield' land potentially allowing them to be built over in future.

'Some landowners regard this as a nutcracker scheme' says Dr Constable.

'Farmland is mostly protected from development – except for solar.

'If you own several thousands of acres of land and you'd like to have an industrial estate solar is a good way to crack the planning nut.'

Then there is the issue of the battery-storage industry which has taken off in the past year.

'Developers are interested in building large solar schemes so they can get permission to house a big battery' explains Dr Constable.

The batteries housed in 40ft-wide containers can hold a reserve of power for when the National Grid is under pressure.

And Dr Constable believes this could be the true reason for their popularity.

'These batteries can store solar power but owners will also use them to buy and store energy from the Grid when it's cheap and then resell for a much higher price when it's in demand' he says.

Locals near Longburton in the Blackmore Vale Dorset opposed similar plans when they emerged last year

'The fact it is very expensive for the consumer is neither here nor there. The solar schemes are almost incidental.'

Farmers and developers are not the only winners. Solar is also good business for local authorities which charge fees for planning applications.

Devon County Council has already received £107591 from the developers at Derril Water.

It can also charge the solar firms business rates which farmers do not normally pay. Meanwhile there is an investment boom as – responding to official pressure – large corporations attempt to show they are diversifying into fashionable green energy.

Environmental concerns are not lost on local vet Adrian Oliver who drives a Tesla electric car and has installed solar panels on the roof of his home in Pyworthy.

Even he has joined his neighbours in objecting to the Derril Water behemoth however.

'The thought of living next to 10ft-high security fences with CCTV cameras on top of them is pretty horrific and that's on both sides of our road' he says.

'It'll be a bit like walking down through a prison camp. Pretty much every single household has objected to this.'

Posted on: May 29 2021 02:24h.

Last updated on: May 29 2021 10:30h.

Caesars Entertainment and the casino giant’s employee retirement money manager Russell Investments are named as defendants in a federal lawsuit brought by a former employee.

Attorneys representing Maggie Thomson claim that Caesars and Russell breached their fiduciary responsibilities and cost workers participating in the company’s 401(k) program more than $100 million. The legal complaint contends that when Caesars outsourced the money management of its retirement program by bringing in Russell the investment firm benefited by transferring nearly all investment options to its own proprietary funds.

Russell obtained control of the Plan’s investment menu in 2017 and promptly filled the Plan with its own poorly performing proprietary funds. Russell’s gambit was a life preserver for its struggling funds and brought $1.4 billion in new investment at a critical time when other plan sponsors were leaving Russell’s funds” the lawsuit filed in Nevada’s US District Court states.

“The deal did not promote the interest of Plan participants however as the Plan already had in place a menu of leading funds that consistently outperformed Russell’s funds at similar or lower levels of risk. Not surprisingly Russell’s self-serving swap has been disastrous for the Plan and cost participants more than $100 million in lost investment earnings to date” the class-action complaint argues.

A statement from Russell Investments rejected the lawsuit.

“We believe this lawsuit is without merit and we intend to vigorously defend the firm against these allegations” the company said.

Caesars Halted Matches

A 401(k) is a common tax-advantaged retirement program offered by employers. Employees can make automatic contributions to their 401(k) accounts and companies typically match a portion of the contribution. Investment earnings in a 401(k) are not taxed until they are withdrawn.

Thomson says when Caesars outsourced its 401(k) program to Russell in 2017 the same year the company emerged from bankruptcy her age-based fund was automatically transferred. Thomson was happy with the returns being realized by the fund offered by State Street another financial management firm that Caesars previously uses. Russell transferred her money from the State Street fund to a similar age-based fund that it managed.

Caesars stopped matching 401(k) contributions for three years after bankruptcy. Thomson attorneys say there was no need to contract Russell as Caesars’ previous retirement program offered “leading low-cost investment funds including age-based balanced options managed by State Street with long track records of success.”

The Caesars 401(k) program has a BrightScope score of 60 out of 100. The BrightScope Rating is based on an algorithm of more than 200 unique data points per plan that is reviewed by independent fiduciaries finance professors and 401(k) experts.

The average rating in the casino peer group is 63. BrightScope 401(k) scores for notable casino operators includes Wynn Resorts (61) MGM Resorts (62) and Las Vegas Sands (66).

According to financial filings Russell’s 401(k) program for Caesars employees has more than 50000 active participants and over $1.6 billion in assets.

Who is Plaintiff?

According to LinkedIn Maggie Thomson joined Caesars Entertainment in 2014 as a marketing analyst in Las Vegas.

She stayed with the casino company until departing in July of 2019 when she returned to her native Illinois and took a job at Discover Financial Services in Chicago.",,,,,,,,,

Designed by BLT Architects the 13-story building will feature 382 residences and 60810 square feet of retail as well as 211 parking spaces. The acquisition was complicated by the site’s ownership being split between 11 different entities and took five years to complete as the result. Having finally completed the transaction the team is ready for the next steps in adding this important project to the up-and-coming neighborhood.

The report of the sale comes around the same time as the announcement of two large buildings being proposed a few blocks further to the east at 200 Spring Garden Street and 412 North 2nd Street.

The site sits at the southwest corner of Northern Liberties where the neighborhood runs up against Poplar to the west and Callowhill to the southwest. The property s bound by Spring Garden Street to the south North 5th Street to the east and North 6th Street to the west. A through-drive parking lot aligned with Green Street is located to the north.

Despite its prime location just two blocks north of Old City the area is an inhospitable no-man’s-land of suburban-style pedestrian-unfriendly developments with low-slung commercial buildings and sprawling parking lots. The transformation occurred in the postwar period when numerous businesses and residents were fleeing the area and the city government initiated an “urban renewal” program that razed much of the traditional urban streetscape along the eastern section of Spring Garden Street.

At the moment the site is home to a drab strip mall anchored by a Dollar General store. Despite its appearance as a single entity the mall was owned by several parties. Consolidation took considerable effort on the part of the developer and MPN Realty Inc. which arranged the final transaction. The Philadelphia Business Journal quotes Victor Rodin defending the process where he explains that the company “spends the time and the effort to maximize value.”

The proposed development will bring much-needed improvement to the property. Retail space will span most of the ground floor. Reportedly an Amazon grocery store will take up the majority of this space.

The residential portion will be located within a tower spanning the eastern half of the site with an entrance at the corner of North 5th Street and Green Street. Total residential square footage will add up to 351473 square feet. The project will also include a public plaza at North 5th Street and two shared roof decks at the top level with a large enclosed amenity space in between. The space and the deck will provide sweeping skyline views of Center City University City the Temple University area and the Northern Liberties core as well as New Jersey across the Delaware River to the east.

The development has already secured permits from the city so demolition may start soon and the building may be completed by late 2022 or 2023. Once completed the building will be a much-need addition to the neighborhood that will animate the street with pedestrian activity and will pave the way for future development on the surrounding blocks.

Since wrestling with giant ticks is not my thing I looked into different options for our outdoor day trips...these are the 5 best BEACH hikes in New Jersey! Ahhhh...that's better.

Listen to Shannon Holly mornings on 94.3 The Point and download our free 94.3 The Point app.

These gorgeous beach hikes will fill your summer with all kinds of happy. There are all sorts of amazing beach trails in Jersey so you can work up a healthy sweat before rewarding yourself with a running dive into our beautiful ocean!

If you are a no-joke hiker then you'll want to visit Gateway National Recreation Area Loop...you can see the NYC skyline while you hike this 11 mile trail. It's located near Highlands New Jersey the trail is primarily used for walking and running and is accessible year-round. Dogs are also able to use this trail but must be kept on leash.

If your looking for a bit of a lighter workout then you'll love the Egg Harbor Township Nature Reserve Loop. This trail is close to two miles long and offers great bird-watching and a relaxing vibe.

This one is for the long-hauler! The Henry Hudson Trail: Highlands to Aberdeen

trail is 28 miles long! However it is a very easy walk that really lets you explore the beach. If I were you I'd bring snacks :)

If you are looking for a side of history with your beach hike then you'll love the Cape May Point Trail. You'll take in historical sites such as a lighthouse a lake and a stunning beach on a two-mile loop trail.

If you are a lighthouse lover then by all means take this hike...The Barnegat Lighthouse Trail. Barnegat Lighthouse is one of New Jersey's most iconic attractions so see it for yourself on this easy two-mile beach walk. This is my favorite so far!

Ohhh...but then we have this bonus hike...I have to agree that The Island Beach State Park Loop Trail needs to make the list...make it a top 6 list because I'm a rule-breaker! Soak up the sun and sand on this hike which is about three and a half miles long in Seaside Park. It's mostly a walk on the beach...like a hike should be. Are you listening Tony?

On a Wednesday afternoon the Fonticello Food Forest in South Side’s Carter Jones Park is alive and tinged with a festive air. A half-dozen volunteers push wheelbarrows full of chocolatey loam toward empty raised garden beds. There are tables lined with boxes and coolers full of food free for the taking donated by the online farmers market Seasonal Roots and by Hatch Helps a donation-based program that prepares 1-quart frozen meals for area nonprofits. Over two hours from 5 to 7 p.m. a few people stop by to fill up grocery bags to take home but for the most part it’s impossible to tell who’s there to help and who’s there for help. And that says Fonticello Food Forest co-founder Laney Sullivan is the whole point.

Inspired by their years of work with mutual aid organizations such as Richmond Food Not Bombs Sullivan and Jameson Price the musical duo known onstage as Høly River (formerly Lobo Marino) followed the process for claiming the land as a community garden after learning about its availability at a Richmond 300 meeting. Now the space is the site of the weekly Free Farmstand Wednesdays food redistribution program that works in partnership with Food Not Bombs and RVA Community Fridges.

The food is for anyone who wants it Sullivan says. “Of course it’s for people who need it but we don’t want to stigmatize it. It’s not the haves giving to the have-nots. We’re all a human family in this system that’s broken and the more abundance we can create for each other the better off we’ll all be.”

This particular day also happens to be Sullivan’s birthday and there’s energy to spare from a group of kids being led by local artist Lily Lamberta in an impromptu “Circus of the Sun” a parade and performance the gathered children made up on the spot to honor that life-giving star.

The Food Forest is an oasis for neighborhood youth with a secret fort hidden among the brambles and an open log circle for congregating and performing. Giant puppets and flags dance against a cotton candy-cloud sky as children’s voices ring out.

On a nearby picnic table there’s an assortment of seedlings in Dixie and Solo cups set up for a seed swap. RVA Community Fridges founder Taylor Scott is here combing through the seedlings and awaiting the boxes of food she’ll take back and redistribute among her organization’s three free refrigerator sites in Richmond and Petersburg. Scott has set the ambitious goal of opening one fridge site per month in 2021 and connecting with the Food Forest gets her one step closer to meeting that goal.

Though a community garden in spirit the Fonticello Food Forest is more than raised beds and redistribution. It’s a doorway to thinking about food differently with a design based on permaculture including native plants fruit trees and other perennials.

“People only consider certain plants as food — tomatoes and cucumbers and things like that” Sullivan says “but there’s an abundance of native plants that are edible: violets and dandelions chickweed all kinds of things that are in abundance all around us that we can eat.” As she talks Sullivan reaches up and plucks a cluster of buds off a tree. It’s black locust she explains native edible with a heavenly floral character — a culinary wonder growing wild for all to enjoy.

As for the garden itself those raised beds will be planted with an assortment of herbs and vegetables. Volunteer Vanessa Kennedy has been working on the garden beds for a few weeks. For her it’s about creating something meaningful for her neighborhood; it’s her seventh year living a half a block from the park. “I want to be a part of this project because it’s so worthwhile” she says. “We need to be able to feel what it is that we’re doing and to make our people understand where the food comes from and that eating food that grows from the earth is better for you than a bunch of junk. If we can get the word out by doing this project and having the kids involved it’s worth it.”

Co-founder Price notes that creating spaces like the Food Forest is a process that’s open to all city residents. “If people through their neighborhood associations and through their parks department occupy these parcels and use them as community gardens we’re creating long-term green space” he says.

Sullivan and Price emphatically agree that the Fonticello Food Forest is part of a larger ecosystem one that relies on mutual aid work being done throughout the city and one that they hope to see become increasingly community-powered.

For anyone motivated to participate Price says look for your closest community garden and lend a hand. “We didn’t start here” he says. “We had been working with the earth and with community-led and city-partnered organizations before this. This is the manifestation of us learning from those experiences to make our community better.”

ANN ARBOR Mich. — Somewhat popular spokesmutant the Noid returned from self-imposed isolation which immediately resulted in newly leaked emails surrounding Pizzagate allegations confirmed sources that thought this was already thoroughly disproven.

“First off I have a longstanding and very public history of hating pizza. Second I’ve never even been to Comet Ping Pong and if I had it would be for the sole purpose of ruining the pizzas that I hate so much” said the Noid in an annoyingly high-pitched voice. “And all those leaked emails between me and the DNC were about having me speak at a campaign fundraiser for Hillary Clinton. The constant news reports about me being involved in a child trafficking ring are making my life worse than a pizza delivered in under 30 minutes.”

Bobby Kimmel revived the conspiracy on his video blog TruthShield which has reportedly caused the Noid to pull his ears and cross his eyes in order to relieve stress.

“If he hates pizza so much then why does he keep getting checks as a Domino’s mascot? He’s clearly doing some behind the curtain stuff to have become so popular” said Kimmel from his “First Amendment Studio” in Texas. “Just follow the money! He’s some screaming guy in superhero pajamas with bunny ears yet he can be seen staying at some of the most expensive hotels across the world. It explains why such a mediocre pizza chain has so many locations. These franchises can’t be making any profits; the Noid must be using them as storage hubs to transport kids across state lines. I have the proof but ‘Big Pizza’ is trying to keep me silent.”

Political consultant John Podesta was upset to hear that Pizzagate was once again being discussed.

“Damn it how in the fuck is this still a thing? Yes I’ve known the Noid for decades. We were members of the same fraternity in college and yes we often catch up over email. People are taking our private exchanges out of context and making us both look bad” said Podesta. “Even if I was a part of a satanic cabal that sacrificed children in the basement of a restaurant I would know better than to invite the Noid into any place near pizzas.”

PPI Building & Construction Division Projects of the Year (two projects shared this award)

The Utah Valley University Pedestrian Bridge Snow and Ice Melting Project; PPI member companies: Rehau (Leesburg VA) and Uponor Inc. (Apple Valley MN)

The new 970-foot pedestrian bridge at the Utah Valley University (UVU) campus needed a reliable snow- and ice-removal system that didn’t involve salting or sanding the surface or moving equipment across the structure. The 305-foot-long 17-foot-wide elevated bridge section suspended up to 35 feet in the air used some 35000 feet of ⅝-in. Rehau Raupex O 2 barrier PEX tubing for snow-melting loops embedded in the concrete pathway. The PEX tubing is supplied with heated antifreeze through 1900 feet of 2.5 to 4 in. Uponor PP-RCT supply-and-return piping. The bridge is the first large-scale use of Uponor PP-RCT in North America.

Texas Military Base Training Center 5 and 6; PPI member company: Asahi/America (Lawrence MA)

The large multi-storied facilities at the Texas Military Base required large-diameter pipe and fittings to move water effectively throughout the campus. Installation locations included crawl spaces underground and in riser locations. The project’s piping ranged in size from 4 to 18 in. and consisted of both SDR 11 and SDR 17 wall thicknesses. More than 6000 feet of Asahitec PP-RCT pipe was used for hot and cold potable non-potable and chilled water plus HVAC heating water and HVAC condenser water.

Asahitec PP-RCT was used instead of carbon steel pipe because polypropylene piping provides long-term performance and maintenance advantages. Because of its light weight ease-of-maneuverability and faster and safer welding methods installing PP-RCT provided several benefits to the installers writes PPI.

PPI Energy Piping Systems Division Projects of the Year (two projects shared this award)

Crestwood Equity Partners: Delaware Basin Saltwater Network Buildout West Texas; PPI member companies: Dow Chemical Co. and Performance Pipe

The Delaware Basin Saltwater Network Buildout project brought a high-temperature saltwater disposal system to the Delaware basin using more than 88000 feet of 12- 18- and 20-in. PE-RT high-density (HD) PE. Because of the lack of infrastructure and a boom in drilling a high number of trucks were required to transport the saltwater to the disposal units. The pipe network provided a way to move the salt water typically between 140 and 180°F. The high temperatures left the engineers with expensive options to cool the produced water or to find a corrosion-resistant pipe that could handle the temperatures. They identified Performance Pipe’s PlatinumStripe 1800 Series manufactured using Dow Intrepid 2499 Polyethylene Raised Temperature (PE-RT & PE4710).

Crestwood Midstream Partners LP: Gondor Salt Water Disposal Facility McKenzie County ND; PPI member company: Victaulic (Easton PA)

Accepting up to 50000 barrels per day of produced water the Crestwood Gondor Saltwater Disposal facility features two wells two separators two oil storage tanks and 10 water storage tanks across nearly three acres. The project which was constructed using both onsite installation and in-shop fabrication consisted of 12-in. and smaller HDPE pipe.

Selecting HDPE over metallic piping systems allowed Crestwood to complete the Gondor Saltwater Disposal facility on time and within budget. Victaulic assisted with the design and fabrication of the Gondor project cutting weeks off of the original construction estimate. The HDPE couplings were installed with minimal effort and onsite assembly required only simple hand tools without the risk of weather delays. The Victaulic couplings eliminated challenging fitting-to-fitting connections and vertical and overhead installation was quickly and easily accomplished according to PPI.

PPI Municipal & Industrial Division Project of the Year

City of Fort Lauderdale’s Redundant Force Main Project Ft. Lauderdale FL; PPI member companies: JM Eagle (Los Angeles CA) and Agru America Inc. (Georgetown SC)

Construction of a new 7.5-mile redundant forced main sewer required two contractors using horizontal directional drilling (HDD) to install the 54-in.-diameter HDPE pipe. Murphy Pipeline Contractors Inc. (Jacksonville FL) ran from the north while David Mancini and Sons (Pompano Beach FL) came from the south. Both companies are contractor members of the Municipal Advisory Board an independent non-commercial adviser to the Municipal & Industrial Division of the PPI.

The $65-million wastewater transmission line from the G.T. Lohmeyer Wastewater Treatment Plant to the wastewater lift station was completed in February 2021 months before it was expected. The project was undertaken due to the city’s existing 50-year-old force main which has experienced frequent breaks during the past several years. It will enable the city to repair the existing force main.

PPI Drainage Division Project of the Year

Project Living Hope Soccer Complex — Camp Marie Haiti; PPI member company: Pacific Corrugated Pipe Co. (Hubbard OR)

Project Living Hope a charitable organization has a vision to create a social center in rural Haiti supporting underprivileged youth in the area. This includes creating a massive sports facility with soccer fields a housing complex vocational center and community hall. After the drainage requirements were identified for the soccer field it was determined that the low material and installation costs associated with corrugated high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe provided the best solution compared to other piping alternatives. It allowed Project Living Hope to complete the soccer field drainage improvements in its entirety rather than in phases.

Some 1500 linear feet of Pacific Corrugated HDPE pipe was used in diameters ranging from 6 to 36 in. Without this drainage system the fields of Camp Marie would have standing water following storms that would take a week of clear weather to dry. Now rainwater is effectively diverted leaving the soccer fields clear and available for daily use.

PPI Power & Communications Division Project of the Year

Pacific Gas & Electric — Napa Valley Balloons Installation (Napa CA); PPI member company: Southwire Co. (Carrollton GA)

The Napa Hot Air Balloon Company wanted to bury existing overhead conductors underground at the launch location of its balloons for safety reasons. To address the customer’s concerns Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) turned to cable-in-conduit (CIC). The goal was to get the trench dug CIC installed and filled again with little traffic interruption for a nearby winery. The use of 13000 feet of Southwire CIC by PG&E for this unique need was an overwhelming success notes PPI. In addition to time and cost savings PG&E now has a permanent raceway available in case a need arises to replace or upgrade the cables. PG&E is now considering CIC as a solution for future grid hardening safety and fire mitigation projects.

PPI also announced the members of the year one for each division. They are:

The Associated Press’ managing editor is speaking out after a firestorm that followed the ousting of former AP journalist Emily Wilder.

Wilder was fired last week after serving just two weeks on the job. The AP said a series of Wilder’s pro-Palestinian tweets violated its social media policy although the AP has not said which tweets violated that policy.

“Emily Wilder was let go because she had a series of social media posts that showed a clear bias toward one side and against another in one of the most divisive and difficult stories we cover” said Brian Carovillano the AP’s managing editor on CNN’s “Reliable Sources” Sunday. “It was a difficult decision; it was not an easy decision and it was not a personal decision and we wish her all the best.”

Before joining the AP Wilder was an active member of pro-Palestinian groups at her college. She was a proponent of Palestinian human rights and a critic of the Israeli government.

Last week during the height of the recent war between Israel and the Palestinians the Stanford College Republicans group called out Wilder for her tweets. Soon after the AP fired Wilder — a unanimous decision among some senior managers at the AP Carovillano said.

The AP believes Wilder’s tweets could have put its journalists in danger — if a perception exists that the AP is taking sides in a conflict it could endanger journalists who are reporting inside a war zone as AP journalists were doing at the time Wilder was tweeting he said.

“It’s really important that we maintain our credibility on these stories” Carovillano said. “Journalists’ safety is at stake and the AP’s credibility is at stake. Our credibility is constantly under attack. Our social media guidelines exist to protect that credibility because protecting our credibility is the same as protecting journalists.”

Carovillano noted the AP believes “it’s everyone’s responsibility to maintain that credibility.”

More than 100 employees at the AP signed an open letter criticizing the AP’s lack of communication about Wilder’s firing.

“It gives us no confidence that any one of us couldn’t be next sacrificed without explanation. It has left our colleagues — particularly emerging journalists — wondering how we treat our own what culture we embrace and what values we truly espouse as a company” the letter said.

In a statement on Saturday Wilder said she is “one victim to the asymmetrical enforcement of rules around objectivity and social media that has censored so many journalists — particularly Palestinian journalists and other journalists of color — before me.”

Carovillano acknowledged that the AP needs to do more to help its journalists when they come under fire on social media.

“Our internal discussions have clearly surfaced a need for better tools to be in place when journalists feel threatened or attacked online” he said.

But Carovillano noted that the AP takes care of its journalists fighting to get them out of prison and working with law enforcement to end harassment of reporters. So he rejected criticism that the AP fired Wilder because it was pressured by the Stanford Republican group.

“That would never happen and that didn’t happen here” Carvovillano said. “This is the Associated Press so anyone who thinks the AP would be cowed by the college Republicans does not know very much about the AP.”"

● Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Director General of the WHO today met with Doctors For Extinction Rebellion who called on health authorities worldwide to prioritise climate and biodiversity loss as a health priority outside the World Health Assembly in Geneva.

● They handed him a letter signed by over 1000 health professionals along with a large hourglass the symbol of Extinction Rebellion.

● Dr Richard Horton editor of the Lancet and Dr James Hospedales former head of the Caribbean Public Health Association called via videolink to speak to Dr Tedros directly and support the message of the protestors.

Before the meeting Doctors for Extinction Rebellion conducted a silent march from Place des Nations towards the WHO where they were welcomed by Dr Maria Neira Director of Public Health Environment and Social Determinants at the WHO and Dr Tedros himself

Professor Valerie D’Acremont an infectious diseases specialist and one of the co-founders of Doctors for Extinction Rebellion Switzerland handed a letter to Dr Tedros which stated: “Health authorities must make the consequences of climate change and biodiversity loss the number one public health issue and support the declaration of a state of emergency for climate and biodiversity.

“We ask the WHO to be the driving force and guarantor of public policies that respect the health of all and preserve life.”

Richard Horton the editor of the Lancet the world’s most prestigious medical journal spoke by videolink from London. He said: “The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us an important lesson—those countries that took early and decisive action successfully protected the health and welfare of their citizens compared with those who delayed.

“The climate emergency is a more far-reaching public health emergency of international concern than COVID-19. It’s time to accelerate our actions towards decarbonisation renewable energy and a green recovery. The costs of inaction will be measured in the preventable deaths of millions of people already living in vulnerable and precarious settings. We cannot let this be the legacy of the present crisis.”

Dr James Hospedales former Executive Director of the Caribbean Public Health Agency and founder of the EarthMedic and EarthNurse Foundation for Global Health called via videolink from Trinidad. He gave a statement on behalf of himself and Dr David Johnson the Chief Medical Officer of Dominica one of the countries worst-hit by hurricane Maria in 2017.

“On behalf of all small and low lying states though coronavirus remains a huge national issue; we cannot ignore that the root cause of both coronavirus and of climate change is the same: A lack of care and reverence for nature. As health professionals we must call for greater protection of our planet in order to protect our patients.”

Having received these messages Dr Tedros addressed the assembled health professionals saying: “The pandemic will end but there is no vaccine for climate change. We have to act now in solidarity to prevent and prepare before it is too late.”

He concluded: “The pandemic has reminded us that health is not a luxury it’s a human right. And that means everyone has the right to clean air and a healthy environment. We know what needs to be done so let’s get to work.”

At the end of Dr Tedros’ speech he was handed a large hourglass the symbol of Extinction Rebellion.

Several senior health professionals from the area were in attendance. Dr Jean Martin former chief medical officer of Vaud the 3rd largest region in Switzerland said “This is an appeal to decision-makers to ask them to act much more vigorously than they have so far.”

Dr Philippe Sudre former chief medical officer Geneva also in attendance said: “We have responded to the covid emergency but other crises are inevitable. We must act on the root cause and put an end to the band-aid strategy.”

Notes for journalists

The World Health Assembly is the world’s highest health policy setting body and is attended by delegations from all WHO Member States (12) once per year.

During COP 21 the WHO’s then Director General Margaret Chan said ““The evidence is overwhelming: climate change endangers human health. Solutions exist and we need to act decisively to change this trajectory(3).”

Mayor Bryan Nelson a Wewa summer camper about 50 years ago who in February proposed the city buy the campground answered a question about the status of the city’s offer by sending a short text “No word from the Y” punctuated with a sad-face emoji.

The Y offered little new information as well.

“All parties are working together to find the best possible outcome for our beloved camp Wewa” said Dan Saginario a YMCA vice president. “We remain optimistic that a positive new chapter for this property will emerge and we look forward to sharing more in the future.”

When it confirmed it was selling Camp Wewa Y leaders cited financial difficulties linked to the coronavirus pandemic which led to the permanent closure of the Tangelo Park YMCA and shortened hours and reduced capacity at its other fitness facilities.

Other YMCAs took similar actions.

According to the New York Times the YMCA of Greater New York closed three camps it had run since 1918 for generations of urban-dwelling children “many of them Black and Latino and from families that could not otherwise afford to provide them a summer in the country.”

Those camps also were put up for sale to cut costs and raise money.

COVID forced the Y to cancel camps last summer. Financial uncertainty nixed the camps this year.

In Apopka where development has boomed especially on the west side of Orange County’s second-largest city Nelson hopes to preserve the acres he loved as a youth as a community park — with amenities for the city to offer summer camps next year.

Apopka City Council approved Nelson’s request in March to bid $4.2 million for the camp.

City administrators cobbled together a financing package that included money from reserves a surplus land sale a recent utility-tax settlement with Duke Energy and a state grant but the offer was still well shy of a $6 million offer from a land developer.

Nelson said the city by law can’t pay more than $4.2 million the value set by a city-commissioned appraisal.

The camp established in 1947 sits on Binion Road surrounded by housing developments a few miles north of AdventHealth Apopka and a State Road 429 interchange. A “Friends of Camp Wewa” Facebook page has about 820 members.

A crowd-funding page for the city’s bid has raised about $15000 so far.

But former campers contribute regularly to the Facebook page recalling how summers there changed them.

“Life took dark turns in years that followed but it was the foundation laid at Camp Wewa that kept me grounded in many ways” one 1990s alumnus wrote. “Grateful that we had a chance to be a part of something special. I really hope it sticks around for the next generation. They’re going to need it.”

Danette Marie Skutak 59 was arrested Dec. 4 after wrecking the specially tricked out golf cart at the intersection of Fudge Terrace and Caulk Court.

Earlier this month in Sumter County Court she entered a plea of no contest to the DUI charge. She will lose her driver’s license for six months has been placed on probation for one year and ordered to perform 50 hours of community service.

When officers arrived at the scene of the crash they found the overturned white Fuzzy’s Vodka golf cart which was equipped with oversized tires according to an arrest report from the Wildwood Police Department.

Skutak “had troubling standing upright and was leaning on the roof of the golf cart” the report said. She said she’d “hit the curb and flipped the golf cart.” A passenger in the golf cart identified Skutak as the driver and said that Skutak had been drinking prior to the crash. One passenger was taken by ambulance to Ocala Regional Medical Center. Another sought treatment at the UF Health The Villages Hospital Freestanding ER at Brownwood.

Skutak admitted she had consumed four vodkas. She had bloodshot eyes slurred speech and “staggered around and nearly fell when she was walking” the report said.

Police attempted to evaluate Skutak’s condition by having her participate in field sobriety exercises but the exercises were halted after she nearly fell over. Officers were afraid she would be harmed if the exercises continued. She provided two breath samples both measuring .203 blood alcohol content.

Her husband Rick Skutak was surprised during a driveway party earlier that evening when a representative of Fuzzy’s Vodka rolled up in the decked-out Fuzzy’s Vodka golf cart. He announced that Skutak was the winner of the golf cart from a field of more than 11000 entrants.

Skutak climbed aboard the golf cart and was soon joined by his wife. The happy couple hoisted what appeared to be Fuzzy’s Vodka cocktails much to the delight of their neighbors.

The Fuzzy’s Vodka representative pointed out that the golf cart was set up for “off roading.”"

According to police Eaton was found unconscious on Long Rife Road in Summit County after going on an evening bike ride. The former center was transported to the hospital where he later passed away.

Standing 7’4 Eaton was one of the tallest players in NBA History winning the Defensive Player of the Year award twice in 1985 and 1989.

The center was a five-time member of the NBA’s All-Defensive team and joined teammates Karl Malone and John Stockton in the 1989 All-Star game in Houston Texas.

Two-time Defensive Player of the Year and a staple of the @UtahJazz community Mark Eaton has passed away. He was 64 years old. — KSL Sports (@kslsports) May 29 2021

Eaton holds the NBA record for career blocked shot average at 3.5 per game and the single-season average at 5.6 blocks per game in 1985.

The center attended UCLA and was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the fifth round of the 1979 NBA Draft. However Eaton chose to become a car mechanic putting basketball behind him.

In 1982 Eaton was again drafted this time by former Jazz coach Frank Layden who convinced the future star to come to the NBA where he would enjoy an 11-year NBA career.

How a chance encounter with Wilt Chamberlain launched Mark Eaton's NBA career. #TakeNote https://t.co/73QN6kISjp — KSL Sports (@kslsports) April 21 2020

Eaton said a chance encounter with superstar Wilt Chamberlain changed his game at a UCLA gym in the early 1980s.

“Look young fella you’re never going to catch that guy” Eaton remembered in a conversation with former teammate Thurl Bailey “And more importantly it’s not really your job. He said come here so he grabbed me and he took me out on the court and he put me right in front of the basket and he said you see this basket behind you your job is to stand here and block shots.”

Eaton retired from the NBA in 1993 and served as a pre and postgame host for Jazz games on KJZZ co-owner of the restaurant Tuscany and founded the Mark Eaton Standing Tall for Youth organization which provided sports and outdoor activities for at-risk children in Utah.

Eaton was born in Inglewood California on January 24 1957. The Jazz retired Eaton’s number 53 jersey on March 1 1996.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vamF6ei9uZXdzL3V0YWgtamF6ei1sZWdlbmQtbWFyay1lYXRvbi1oYXMtZGllZC1hZ2UtNjTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Utah Jazz legend Mark Eaton dies after apparent bicycle crash,"Mark Eaton the two-time Defensive Player of the Year who spent his entire NBA career with the Utah Jazz has died. He was 64 years old.

Eaton was riding his bike in Summit County Utah on Friday night. Just before 8:30 p.m. passersby saw Eaton lying in the road after apparently crashing according to the Summit County Sheriff's Office. Officials said ""there is no reason to believe a vehicle was involved in the incident. Eaton was taken to a hospital where he later died.

“The Utah Jazz are profoundly saddened at the unexpected passing of Mark Eaton who was an enduring figure in our franchise history and had a significant impact in the community after his basketball career. Mark played his entire 11-year NBA career with the Jazz and his number was retired as an NBA All-Star and two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year"" the Utah Jazz said in a statement. ""His presence continued around the organization as a friend and ambassador while giving back as a businessman and volunteer to his adopted hometown in Utah. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Teri and their extended family. Mark will be greatly missed by all of us with the Jazz.”

Eaton was drafted by the Jazz in the fourth round of the 1982 NBA Draft. The 7-foot-4 center out of UCLA would go on to play 11 seasons in Utah establishing himself as one of the league’s most feared interior defenders.

Eaton blocked 3064 shots during his career — fourth-most in NBA history. He led the league in blocks in 1984 ’85 ’87 and ’88. He still holds the record for most blocked shots in a season (456 in 1984-85).

“It kind of astounds me” Eaton said in a 2019 UtahJazz.com interview. “I always thought there would be someone that came along and knock me off the block. It’s remarkable. I don’t think about it a whole lot but sometimes I look at all the great centers that have come along and nobody has come close to breaking that record. It’s kind of crazy.”

Eaton was named an NBA All-Star in 1989. In both 1985 and ’89 he was named Defensive Player of the Year. Three times he was named to the All-Defensive First Team and twice he was named to the All-Defensive Second Team.

Eaton's No. 53 was retired by the Jazz during the 1995-96 season.

“We lost someone that was a part of the Jazz family today” head coach Quin Snyder said. “Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Teri. Mark was someone that was a friend and a friend to a lot of us.""

Eaton’s storied basketball career however might not have happened if not for a chance encounter. The 7-foot-4 Eaton was working as an auto mechanic in Arizona when a community college basketball coach noticed him in 1977. After convincing Eaton to enroll at Cypress College he transferred to UCLA to play under legendary coach John Wooden.

“I had an unusual background” Eaton said. “It’s an unlikely story to be sure. I basically came into the NBA with two years of junior college experience and sat on the bench at UCLA for two years. And Frank Layden gave me a chance and the team was in a space where they could afford to let me make some mistakes out there and get my feet underneath me. It worked out well for both of us.”

Despite all of his personal accolades Eaton often said he was most proud of from his playing days was being on a winning team for all but one of his seasons in the league.

“We created a culture that is still part of the team’s identity today” Eaton said.

After Eaton retired from the game in 1993 he only further established himself as a member of the Salt Lake community. Eaton was a restaurateur the owner of Tuscany’s and Franck’s in Holladay.

“When I retired I thought where am I going to live and raise my kids? Utah had been such a fabulous place to me. It’s home” he said.

Eaton became an author and a motivational speaker.

He was also a friend and mentor to the Jazz’s current All-Star center Rudy Gobert.

“I will text Rudy on occasion and tell him your job is to guard the entire team. The paint is your house. Don’t let anybody in there” Eaton said. “I love watching him. He’s so exciting.”

Snyder said Eaton's relationship with Gobert was emblematic of who the late All-Star was as a person.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEzbm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvdXRhaC1qYXp6LWdyZWF0LW1hcmstZWF0b24tZGllcy1hdC02NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Utah Jazz great Mark Eaton dies at 64,"SALT LAKE CITY — Former Utah Jazz great Mark Eaton has died at the age of 64 following a bike incident Friday.

The Summit County Sheriff's Office said it received a call Friday night of an unconscious man lying in Long Island Road in Silver Creek Estates. Upon arriving at the scene officials identified the man as Eaton who had appeared to have been riding a bicycle and crashed. The sheriff's office does not believe any other vehicles were involved in the accident.

Eaton was transported to the hospital where he later died.

A fourth-round pick by the Jazz in the 1982 NBA Draft Eaton went on to be named a two-time league Defensive Player of the Year along with being named to the All-Star team in 1989.

Eaton's No. 53 jersey was retired by the Jazz following his retirement at the end of the 1992-93 season. In his 11 NBA seasons Eaton averaged just 6 points but dominated defensively by averaging 7.9 rebounds per game.

Current Jazz center Rudy Gobert tweeted his thoughts on the passing of Eaton.

""One of kind and an amazing human being I’m grateful for your presence in my life over the years. Gonna miss our conversations. But I know you’ll be watching"" wrote Gobert calling Eaton ""a great mentor and friend.

Before Saturday's NBA Playoff games TNT paid homage to Eaton with members of the on-air team sharing memories of the former Jazz player.

""As much as Stockton and Malone were the face of the Utah Jazz so was Mark Eaton"" said former NBA player turned broadcaster Kenny Smith.

In 2018 FOX 13's Bob Evans sat down with Eaton to discuss his life in the restaurant business and public speaking after his basketball career ended. Eaton co-owned Tuscany in Salt Lake City since it opened in 1996.

“When I retired I thought where am I going to live and raise my kids? Utah had been such a fabulous place to me. It’s home” Eaton said in a 2019 interview with UtahJazz.com.

USA Today's Bob Nightengale tweeted that Eaton was in Chicago earlier this week to attend umpire Joe West's record-breaking game on the field.

Eaton died Saturday at the age of 64

Former Utah Jazz All-Star Mark Eaton died Friday at the age of 64.

The Summit County (Utah) Sheriff’s Office announced Saturday it received a 911 call at 8:26 p.m. Friday “from a citizen who reported finding an unconscious man lying in the roadway on Long Rifle Road in the Silver Creek Estates neighborhood of Summit County. It appears the man was riding a bicycle and crashed.”

The man was identified as Eaton. He was taken to the hospital where he died. The sheriff’s office said there is no reason to believe a vehicle was involved.

“The Utah Office of the Medical Examiner will determine the cause of Mr. Eaton’s death” the press release stated.

Related Jazz commitment strategy dates back to Mark Eaton

The 7-foot-4 Eaton played for the Jazz from 1982-93 after being a fourth-round draft pick out of UCLA. His size made him a dominant force on the defensive end and he was named the NBA’s Defensive Player of the Year in 1985 and 1989.

He was named an All-Star once in 1989 and his No. 53 was retired by the Jazz.

“We lost someone that was a part of the Jazz family today in Mark Eaton” Jazz head coach Quin Snyder said. “Mark was someone that was a friend...his ability to listen and then to offer counsel and support was something that was really unique and obviously we’ll miss him.”

Though Eaton established himself as one of the most dominant defenders in the game and had a career that has stood the test of time — his 456 total blocks and 5.6 blocks per game in the 1984-85 season are NBA records that have not been broken — his journey to the NBA was not one that foreshadowed such success.

From tire shop to college basketball

Eaton was soured by basketball after spending more time on the bench than he did on the court in high school and he decided to attend trade school and find work rather than pursue a life in the sport.

It was while working at a tire shop in Southern California that Eaton was discovered by Tom Lubin a junior college assistant basketball coach. Lubin convinced Eaton to play at Cypress Junior College and later Eaton transferred to UCLA.

“The special part about Mark is that his journey really made the man” Utah Jazz broadcaster Craig Bolerjack said in an interview with the Deseret News on Saturday. “What I loved about Mark was his humility. I think we’ve lost some of that in our world and for me he was a bastion of light. I know that sounds a little heavy but I always just sat back at all of how he handled everything.”

Bolerjack learned of Eaton’s passing by getting a call from Karl Malone on Saturday morning.

“He was very upset over hearing about Mark” Bolerjack said of Malone. “And I am too. That’s just an iconic person an iconic individual and an iconic gentleman.”

After his playing career Eaton remained in Utah and became an accomplished businessman speaker and author.

“The Utah Jazz are profoundly saddened at the unexpected passing of Mark Eaton who was an enduring figure in our franchise history and had a significant impact in the community after his basketball career” the team said in a statement. “Mark played his entire 11-year NBA career with the Jazz and his number was retired as an NBA All-Star and two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year.

“His presence continued around the organization as a friend and ambassador while giving back as a businessman and volunteer to his adopted hometown in Utah. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Teri and their extended family. Mark will be greatly missed by all of us with the Jazz.”

Dominant defender gentle giant

While on the court Eaton was known as a shutdown defender who dominated with his shot-blocking abilities. Off the court he was known as a gentle giant who always had time for fans was always willing to take photos and who embraced his stature in every sense.

Former NBA player Rex Chapman whose rookie season was the same 1989 season that saw Eaton earn his second DPOY award said that when clips circulated on social media of him being blocked by Eaton it gave him an opportunity to reach out to him.

“I just knew Mark from playing against him” Chapman said. “There is a clip of him blocking a dunk of mine where he didn’t even jump from like the ’80s. It would surface every now and then on social media and he and I would comment and say hi through our DMs. Everyone I know who played with him raved about what a kind guy he was. So sad 64 is too damn young.”

After word spread Saturday morning of Eaton’s passing Rudy Gobert who Eaton had grown close to over the years serving as a mentor to the Jazz’s second two-time DPOY tweeted his condolences.

Others around the league and around the Utah community also paid tribute to the former Utah big man via social media.

‘Just broke my heart’

On “Inside the NBA” Saturday morning Charles Barkley said he had been in contact throughout the last week with Eaton as Eaton was in Atlanta celebrating the career of Major League Baseball umpire Joe West.

“That just broke my heart” Barkley said calling Eaton “the ultimate gentle giant.”

Shaquille O’Neal said he didn’t know Eaton but that Eaton was “the first gentleman that made me feel small (physically) ... and he was tough. I used to give him that old patented elbow sandwich that I give the guys. He never complained never said anything so my condolences go out to his family. I hear nothing but great things about him.”

Added Kenny Smith: “A class act. Gentleman. A 7-foot-4 gentleman but a tenacious rebounder tenacious shot blocker and then you get off the court he’d shake your hand brush your shoulder off for you if you needed something.

“As much as (John) Stockton and (Karl) Malone were the face of the Utah Jazz so was Mark Eaton. Everyone associated him with the Utah Jazz.”

Smith noted that Eaton was effective after his playing career in connecting former players with each other through the retired players association.

“We all talked to him on a lot of different basis and he will be dearly missed” Smith said.

Gordon Chiesa a Jazz assistant coach from 1989-05 arrived in Salt Lake City shortly after Eaton’s All-Star season and recalled in an interview with the Deseret News how Eaton and then-team owner Larry H. Miller formed a close relationship because of their mutual love of cars.

“They had an innate relationship about cars” Chiesa said.

Chiesa said that while Eaton and Gobert often get compared to each other because of their similar size and defensive prowess Eaton was not nearly as athletic as Gobert but became a force nonetheless thanks to his intelligence and work ethic.

Like Gobert Chiesa said that one area of Eaton’s game that was perhaps underappreciated was his ability to set great picks especially in an era before “screen assists” entered the basketball lexicon.

“I used to use the expression ‘When Mark Eaton set his screen the dribbler saw daylight but the defender saw darkness’” Chiesa said. “He was a great screener ... in Jazz basketball he was the first great screener we ever had.”

More than a shot blocker

Although Eaton lacked athleticism on par with many in the NBA Chiesa said his willingness to hustle allowed him to be successful.

“He was a plodder down the court that ran every time hard” Chiesa said. “Even though 9/10ths of the players were faster than him he often beat those guys down the court because of his will to do the right thing.”

That work ethic also allowed Eaton to improve his offensive game over the years to the point that he could be effective around the basket.

“Each passing year he got more steadiness as far as fluidity with his shot” Chiesa said. “His skills did develop absolutely but he knew who he was.”

Chiesa said he would frequent Eaton’s Holladay restaurant Tuscany often over the years after Eaton’s retirement.

“He was generous. He was an entrepreneur” Chiesa said. “He took his basketball career arc and made it into an entrepreneurship with the restaurants and his leadership.”

Former Jazzman Antoine Carr joined the team just before Eaton formally retired so he never played with him but Carr said in an interview with the Deseret News that they got to know each other well during the four seasons Carr was with Utah (Eaton went to some of the basketball camps Carr ran) and kept in touch over the years.

“I’m just lost for words right now” Carr said. “For me he was just a big softie. A big nice super guy that anybody would love to have as a friend. You look at him as big as he is you would think ‘Oh man this guy’s going to be mean’ but he’s probably one of the nicest guys anyone would ever meet.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY28udWsvbmJhL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvMzE1MzI1MDcvZm9ybWVyLXV0YWgtamF6ei1jZW50ZXItbWFyay1lYXRvbi1kaWVzLWJpY3ljbGUtY3Jhc2gtYWdlLTY00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Utah Jazz center Mark Eaton dies after bicycle crash at age 64,"Mark Eaton the 7-foot-4 shot-blocking king who twice was the NBA Defensive Player of the Year during his career with the Utah Jazz has died the team said Saturday.

The center who spent his entire career with the Jazz led the league in blocks per game four times and his average of 5.6 per contest in 1984-85 remains the highest average since the NBA started officially tracking that statistic.

""He was so impressive"" longtime NBA broadcaster Mike Inglis now the radio voice of the Miami Heat said Saturday. ""I used to call him the human condominium complex. He was something else on defense let me tell you.""

Eaton's career blocks average of 3.51 per game is the best in NBA history and his career happened almost by accident. He was working as an auto mechanic in 1977 when a community college basketball coach persuaded him to enroll. From there he went to UCLA and his stint with the Jazz followed.

His 11 playing seasons with the Jazz are third most in team history behind longtime Utah cornerstones Karl Malone and John Stockton. His durability was noteworthy with him once appearing in 338 consecutive games. He finished with career averages of 6.0 points and 7.9 rebounds.

Eaton's No. 53 was one of the first jerseys retired by the Jazz. He was the DPOY in 1984-85 and 1988-89 was a five-time All-Defensive team selection -- with three first-team nods two second-team picks -- and was an All-Star in 1989.

He had been among other things a restaurateur and a motivational speaker in his retirement. In recent years he served as a mentor to Utah center Rudy Gobert -- the only other player in Jazz history to win the Defensive Player of the Year award.

""To my great mentor and friend @markeaton7ft4 one of kind and an amazing human being i'm grateful for your presence in my life over the years"" Gobert posted Saturday on Twitter. ""Gonna miss our conversations. But i know you'll be watching.""

Utah coach Quin Snyder said Saturday night before Game 3 in Memphis that the team's thoughts and prayers go out to Eaton's wife.

""Mark was someone that was a friend and I think a friend who a lot of us in his relationship with Rudy Gobert I think is emblematic of who he was and his ability to listen'' Snyder said. ""And then to offer counsel and support was something that was really unique and obviously we'll miss him.""

Eaton also served as an officer in the National Basketball Players Association and the union released a statement Saturday saying he would be missed.

""It may be cliched but it's true: Mark Eaton was a giant in every sense of the word"" the NBPA statement said. ""A long-time member of the NBPA Executive Committee right through his retirement from the league in 1994 Mark served his colleagues with grace and strength and continued to watch over them through his service for the Retired Players Association. His imposing physical presence made a delightful match with his warm and thoughtful manner.""

Eaton's death came days after he was in Chicago to be part of the celebration for his friend Joe West who broke baseball's umpiring record Tuesday night by working his 5376th regular-season game.

Eaton was taken by Phoenix with the 107th pick in the 1979 draft then drafted again at No. 72 by Utah in 1982. And he never left. His last game was in 1993; back problems ended his career and he retired in September 1994.

""It has been a great ride but life does have a way of moving on and I must move on with it"" Eaton wrote in a column for The Salt Lake Tribune in which he announced his retirement. ""Thank you for letting me be a part of your life and community. I'll be around.""

This time around though it involves a McDonald's chicken nugget from the limited edition BTS Meal that appears to be shaped like a crewmate in ""Among Us."" This outrageous collectible is being sold on eBay for a hefty price tag.

""Among Us"" which launched in 2018 broke the internet in 2020. Since then various twists have graced the game.

The surprising rise of the app is attributed to Twitch streams made last year.

For instance popular streamers with millions of followers like Pewdiepie and Shroud have been playing it. It has been popular as the world has been shut down by the COVID-19 pandemic.

With that gamers stuck in the confines of their homes hopped on to the two-year-old cross-platform game. As such Reddit and Twitter have been flooded with memes that propelled ""Among Us"" to received millions of downloads.

In 2021 the hype of the game has faltered when compared to its peak in mid-September 2020. However eBay listing with a crewmate-like chicken nugget proves its relevance until now.

In addition the popular multiplayer game is now available on PS4 and PS5 as well. There are maps and features expansions to enjoy too.

'Among Us' Chicken Nugget

The Mcdonald's BTS Meal has had its puff. Its empty packaging was even sold on Malaysia's e-commerce website for a whopping price tag too.

And now the McDonald's and BTS collaboration found another level of craze on the internet -- with its crewmate-like shaped chicken nuggets listed on eBay. In hindsight crewmates are the protagonists of ""Among Us"" the impostor is their opposite counterpart.

Furthermore an eBay user named Polizna is lucky enough to stumble upon a chicken nugget that resembles a popular game character. And interestingly it certainly could pass as a crewmate silhouette. It is egg-shaped with two ""legs"" below it.

How Much Is It?

Buyers could set their bids on the eBay listing. And currently ComicBook reports the highest bid is at $72 among the total of 31 bids placed already.

The original price of the nugget is higher -- to the tune of $1396 as per ScreenRant. The seller has since dropped the price after a user complained that the ""shipping was too much."" But as of now the initial listing could no longer be found. The one with a bidding option remains to be posted instead.

The bidding still has not come to an end. So buyers should expect the price to still skyrocket.

A ""cynical"" fraudster stole a Rolex watch and jewellery worth more than £20000 from two disabled victims using eBay and the marketplace website Gumtree.

Zach Brendel tricked them into believing they were receiving a valid cheque and bank transfer and they innocently handed over the items.

However the transactions were in fact worthless and it was a “cynical fraud” Caernarfon Crown Court heard.

Brendel 32 was only caught when the man who had met the fraudster in a motorway service station car park to give away his valuable Rolex Submariner watch tracked him down himself having initially been turned away by police.

A judge jailed Brendel for a total of two years and 10 months for fraud.

Prosecutor Andrew Green said Brendel had contacted Raymond Kay over the Rolex Submariner watch on eBay in September 2017.

Mr Kay listed it as worth about £19000 but after negotiations agreed to sell it for £14750 to Brendel who was using the name Ryan Fordham.

Mr Kay and Brendel exchanged contact details.

The prosecutor said: ""It was agreed that the defendant (Brendel) would deposit the funds into the complainant's (Mr Kay's) bank account and a meeting was arranged to exchange the watch.""

Later Mr Kay saw that the money had been deposited into his bank account.

He then drove to the meeting place - Forton Service Station car park on the M6 in Lancaster. He saw Brendel in his black Mercedes and gave him the Rolex watch.

But soon afterwards the court heard that Mr Kay went online and noticed that the £14750 was showing as ""unavailable"" in his account.

The prosecutor said he rang the mobile phone number Brendel had given him but got no answer.

On September 6 Mr Kay went online again and found the money had been removed from his account.

He contacted the Nationwide Building Society and its financial crime analyst. They found Brendel had paid in a cheque for a ""designer card"" but then closed that account.

He went to police but when he got no conviction he used the email address which Brendel had given him to find him on Facebook and then police swooped.

Mr Green said Brendel's second victim was Sheila Stevens now aged 68 of Kinmel Bay.

She tried to sell her diamond ring and bracelet for £6400 on Gumtree on May 13 last year.

On June 2 Brendel rang her and asked if she would accept a bank transfer. She agreed.

The court heard CCTV showed Brendel then paying in the cheque to the Nationwide branch in Huddersfield.

Later Mrs Stevens ""messaged Brendel to say the money was in the account"".

He called at her home and was given the jewellery - a gift from her late husband. She needed to sell it to pay for new car tyres and other commitments.

But two days later on June 4 Mrs Stevens checked her bank account and the money was no longer there. It had been paid into the branch by cheque under the name ""Rashid"".

Caernarfon Crown Court heard that the Nationwide launched a ""painstaking investigation"" and contacted police.

The prosecutor said officers arrested Brendel in Basingstoke in Hampshire in August last year.

Mr Kay said he had felt ""alone and betrayed"" following the fraud but that he felt ""great joy"" as Brendel is facing justice.

Mrs Stevens lost weight with the stress and fears being ""scammed again"" the court heard.

Katy Laverty defending said Brendel of Delhide Close  Springhead Oldham has five children some with autism or ADHD. He has got a job as a labourer and started a Business Management degree.

But Judge Timothy Petts called his offending a ""cynical fraud"".

In Mr Kay's case he said: ""All you had done was pay money into his account from a closed account.""

And he added: ""Mr Kay is to be commended for his investigation"".

On Mrs Stevens the judge told the defendant: ""You pretended that you had paid her by bank transfer (but) you had paid a worthless cheque into her account.

""You travelled from your home as far as Huddersfield to pay it in.""

The judge added: ""These were planned sophisticated and targeted offences against two victims who could ill-afford the loss and consequences have to follow.""

He jailed Brendel for 20 months for the fraud over the Rolex and 14 months over the jewellery offence.

He added that the victims are free to use a county court to try to recover some of their losses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNjb3R0aXNoc3VuLmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvc2NvdHRpc2gtbmV3cy83MTg2NzM1L2ltcmFuLWJhbGR5LXNoYWhpZC1wYWludGluZ3Mtb25saW5lLXByaXNvbi_SAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzY290dGlzaHN1bi5jby51ay9uZXdzL3Njb3R0aXNoLW5ld3MvNzE4NjczNS9pbXJhbi1iYWxkeS1zaGFoaWQtcGFpbnRpbmdzLW9ubGluZS1wcmlzb24vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scots race hate killer Imran ‘Baldy’ Shahid flogging chilling paintings online that he created in pri...,"KILLER ART Scots race hate killer Imran ‘Baldy’ Shahid flogging chilling paintings online that he created in prison

RACE hate killer Imran ‘Baldy’ Shahid is flogging a series of chilling paintings he created behind bars.

The six artworks including “disturbing” images of crazed bloodshot eyes appeared on eBay.

Tory MSP Jamie Greene warned the sale will inflict “trauma and distress” on the family of victim Kriss Donald 15 who was murdered by Shahid 42 in Glasgow.

However the six warped paintings said to have been made using items salvaged from a prison riot have failed to attract a single bid as a deadline closed tonight.

They included one featuring a pair of bloodshot eyes a jester a portrait of boxing icon Muhammad Ali a gun cylinder and a Covid-inspired piece titled Masked Soul.

Each design was being punted with a handwritten note supposedly from the monster 42 - and claiming profits would go to good causes such as the NHS.

But buyers shunned the artworks created at tough HMP Grampian in Peterhead where Shahid is caged for the torture and murder of Kriss Donald 15 in 2004.

The sales pitch said: “My name is Imran Shahid and I am serving a life sentence for murder.

“I painted these pieces using furniture smashed by prisoners during the unrest caused by the start of the national lockdown in March 2020 due to the pandemic.

“As well as using this furniture born of violence as the canvas I used acrylic paints and later incorporated paint that the prison uses to paint their walls and doors.

“Each piece is individual and has its own unique story.

“I hope you get as much enjoyment from owning these pieces as I did in creating them.”

The seller’s blurb added: “All the money raised from these pieces will be donated to the NHS for their heroic work during the pandemic.

“They are in dire need of the financial support after the insulting pay rise they received from Boris Johnson after saving his life when he contracted the virus.”

The six pieces app­eared online this week.

The crazed bloodshot eyes piece was made using wood salvaged from bins after a jail riot according to the sales blurb.

The description said: “This painting is showing a window into the soul during the pandemic and the colours used emphasise the torment of this time.”

Others had notes citing politics including Donald Trump and Black Lives Matter.

The seller claimed a mask painted on Ali represented “Trump’s attempts to gag/silence the BLM movement”.

And the jester painting is accompanied by a rant against Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings.

It’s believed the notes were written by a third party.

Tory shadow justice secretary Jamie Greene said the family of tragic Kriss would be “rightly astonished” by the online auction.

The MSP added last night: “The murder of Kriss Donald was an abhorrent and heinous crime.

“These so-called paintings shine a light into the disturbing mind of a man who killed and tortured a young boy on our streets.

“They serve no purpose other than inflicting trauma and distress on the victim’s family so many years after justice was served on his killers.”

Shahid was caged for at least 25 years over Kriss’s killing in Pollokshields Glasgow.

The maniac was the ringleader of a gang that stabbed the innocent teen 13 times before setting him on fire.

In 2017 he took a prison governor to court for confiscating his penis pump.

The whining lag said he’d used Viagra instead but it had caused “serious” side effects.

He also demanded the return of a games console.

The Scottish Prison Service and eBay were contacted for comment.

The biggest change in the Legendary Edition is actually the load times. Out of everything that they updated this is the thing that really makes me want to recommend this version of Mass Effect to any console gamers out there because the change is outstanding. In the PS3 version of Mass Effect 2 moving between the different floors in the Normandy could take up to five minutes that’s if it even finished loading in the first place. So when I entered the elevator in the remaster I was already reflexively reaching into my pocket for my phone to keep myself entertained while the game loaded but it was already finished by the time I had it in my hand. This change does so much for the game especially considering how much time you spend moving between floors to speak to all of your squad members or to upgrade parts of the Normandy.

It also improves the loading times in the first Mass Effect namely the elevator rides on the Citadel well known for being lengthy. In the original your party members would have conversations while the game was loading as a way to keep you busy but half the time it would still load for another two minutes when they finished speaking. In the Legendary Edition it’s done loading before the dialogue is even halfway finished and you have the option to either let the conversation play out or skip it and get right back to the game. A very good choice because these little interactions are the most you get of dialogue between party members in the first game and cutting it entirely would be a great loss.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9rbm9ja291dC1jaXR5LWluc3RhLWtpbGwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Knockout City Needs To Sort Out Its Insta-Kill Moves,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVyLmNvbS9rbm9ja291dC1jaXR5LWluc3RhLWtpbGwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbGxwYXBlci5jb20vYXJ0L2JydWNlLW5hdW1hbi1jb250cmFwcG9zdG8tc3R1ZGllcy1wdW50YS1kZWxsYS1kb2dhbmEtdmVuaWNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bruce Nauman's Venice mega-show is a full body experience,"As Europe’s museums and galleries trickled back to life post-lockdown the last two years of Venice culture have been comparatively a deluge. As the Biennale of Architecture opened its doors for the first time in two years the floating city’s wealth of cultural institutions followed suit with a dazzling 57th Venice Biennale earlier this year.

A highlight throughout both came from the Pinault Collection’s Punta della Dogana just across the Grand Canal from St Mark’s Square which inaugurated a new show dedicated to American contemporary artist Bruce Nauman – his first major exhibition in Venice since winning the Biennale’s Golden Lion in 2009.

Titled ‘Bruce Nauman: Contrapposto Studies’ (and now in its final week) the exhibition weaves its way across disparate eras of the prolific artist’s career focusing largely on Nauman’s work with sound and performance.

‘It’s a show with nearly no objects’ says Pinault Collection curator Caroline Bourgeois who alongside Carlos Basualdo senior curator of contemporary art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art is responsible for bringing the works to Venice. ‘It is just sound that takes you through. It is an experiment because Bruce has always done experiments.’



Though it is not strictly a retrospective much like the artist’s major Tate Modern show in 2020 the exhibition which runs until November 2022 circles several themes Nauman has consistently returned to in his practice: the body; sound as medium; and the studio as a creative space. Indeed the breadth of work on show illustrates Nauman’s commitment to exploring the endless potential of a single idea. From his early video work – Bouncing in the Corner No. 1 (1968) Slow Angle Walk (Beckett Walk) (1968) – to sound pieces like the stilted piano plonking of For Beginners (instructed piano) (2010) and Untitled performance from 1969 in which actors stand lie or crouch motionless on the gallery floor.

As a guiding principle all pieces brought to Punta della Dogana were chosen for their relationship to a single foundational work Nauman’s 1968 video piece Walk with Contrapposto in which he traverses a narrow corridor hands clasped behind his head jutting out his hips and posing with each step. The film is black and white grainy and shot from above at an angle distorting and obscuring his figure as he travels back and forth. (Contrapposto or counterpoise refers to the common statuary stance – think: the jaunty pose of Michelangelo’s David.) ‘I think the tension between who we think we are how we represent ourselves and how we feel we are is really what the show is about’ Basualdo says.



In the 2010s Nauman revisited Walk with Contrapposto creating a new series based on the same repetitive movements though this time aided by advances in technology. His Contrapposto Studies I through VII (2015/2016) first shown at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 2017 and now projected larger than life onto Punta della Dogana’s walls show the artist walking in the same straight line. In the updated version the feed is full colour and crisp each image split into seven sections and repeated 14 separate times an allusion to Da Vinci’s theories of proportion.

Later in the exhibition the exercise is recreated in 3D; viewers are invited to sit on a bench wearing the requisite glasses as Nauman walks towards them turns on his heel and returns. One of the more interesting aspects of the exhibition is seeing first-hand the continuity of Nauman’s ideas as his own physical conditions change: swapping a primitive camcorder for a high-definition camera; how differently his body moves with age. ‘What you will find in the exhibition is an artist who with extraordinarily grateful simplicity offers you an opportunity to think about your own body in the space and yourself inside your body’ adds Basualdo.



For his latest piece Nature Morte (2020) shown for the first time in Europe at Punta della Dogana Nauman utilised 3D-mapping technology to create a digital model of his own workspace. Visitors can pinch and scroll on an iPad zooming into half-finished works posters and clutter strewn on the floor. It’s a fitting finale to the show particularly following a year in which Nauman himself was not able to travel allowing visitors to step into his New Mexico studio all the way from the banks of Venice’s Grand Canal.

Simulation games are popular among gamers and they can cover a wide variety of topics. Some have remained fan favorites over the years. One well-known franchise is The Sims. The Sims 4 came out on PC in 2014 and the Mac-compatible version was released in 2015.

Plenty of recognizable items and features have carried over from game to game. One of which is the way sims speak to each other during interactions. The virtual people have their own set of distinctive words and phrases.

‘The Sims 4’ lets players control virtual lives as they see fit

The Sims 4 is the fourth major installment to The Sims franchise. Maxis developed the game but Electronic Arts published it. So far there are 10 expansion packs available. The most recent one is Snowy Escape which came out in 2020. There are 18 stuff packs and nine game packs to add flavor to the base game as well.

Much like the previous titles The Sims 4 is a simulation game. Players can create sims to look like themselves or other people. A person can control every aspect of a sim’s life including their career relationships and personality traits. The moodlets can lead to new options for interactions.

The game also comes with cheat codes for the player to use for an easier playstyle. A common one gives players plenty of money to buy expensive houses and items from the store. Someone can edit relationships or enable objects to overlap with one another. Those on a PC PS4 or Xbox can use cheat codes to unlock fun things.

What is the language all the sims are speaking?

Since The Sims 4 is a life simulation game there is going to be dialogue. Like the previous installment players can hear their sims talk but all the words sound like they are speaking gibberish. The unintelligible dialogue makes it easier for anyone to insert themselves into their character. Perhaps that is what creator Will Wright planned for the game.

Players know the fictional language as Simlish and they can pick up certain phrases. The most common ones are “sul sul” “nooboo” and “dag dag.” The language may sound weird for someone who is new to the franchise but fans have come to love the way their sims speak. Players have multiple options on how they want a voice to sound.

Even though players do not know what the character is saying they can get a basic understanding based on the tone. Body posture and inflection can indicate if the words express anger or playfulness.

The Developer made Simlish distinct from other languages

When The Sims 4 released fans were disappointed by the lack of content in the base game compared to the previous title. Some of them may not have a positive outlook for a potential sequel. However one thing does remain the same and that is Simlish. The simulation game does not have subtitles to translate the language.

Fans have been able to recognize what some of the words mean. For example “sul sul” means hello in The Sims world. It is almost like Simlish is its own unique language.

According to The Verge Wright spent a lot of time crafting Simlish to separate it from existing languages.

At first voice actors had to read Ukrainian and Navajo words as they appeared on the page. Next the developer tried an altered version of Swahili and Cherokee which did not work either. The breakthrough happened when an actor spoke gummy English.

Simlish has more in common with baby talk than English but English-to-Simlish translations exist despite there being no official dictionary."

A peaceful glow emanates from the front wall covered with 15 screens and it gives the room a calm feeling.

A calm feeling in an otherwise intense chaotic high-pressure situation.

This is race control. This is the heartbeat of the Indianapolis 500. Inside the room when cars are racing it feels like scenes playing out from the movie ""Apollo 13."" That's the best way Kyle Novak can describe it.

This is the domain he oversees as race director of IndyCar a domain filled with mission specialists a small but mighty army whose job it is to make sure the Indy 500 is pulled off without a hitch and if there is one to help fix it.

""This is the nerve center. This is where the race is actually run from"" said Novak. ""We make all the decisions right here.""

Right here inside the Pagoda at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Without this tiered tower with its glistening teal glass not an Indy 500 victory not a restart not a cleanup not an NBC broadcast not a sick fan being helped not a drunk fan being arrested would happen at the Indianapolis 500.

Ten floors and a rooftop make up the Pagoda 153 feet from bottom to top and spanning 65000 square feet inside the steel and concrete tower.

It's an elite place not many are allowed to be. But those who are inside what is inside and what happens inside is everything the Greatest Spectacle in Racing is all about.

Floor 1: Drivers pace cars $1M trophy

On the ground level of the Pagoda is the garage where Chevrolet displays the official pace car for the Indy 500 as well as backup pace cars. This May a 2021 mid-engine Corvette Stingray hardtop convertible is the show ride.

The garage though is not just for the cars to be seen. Inside they are worked on and tested to make sure everything is in optimal condition for race day and this year's pace car driver Danica Patrick.

Across from the garage is a green room where drivers gathered at 11:30 a.m. Sunday for roll call before their introductions.

Indy 500 final running order:How each driver finished in 2021 race

On some days fans who walk by inside of the track can catch a glimpse of the hallowed Borg-Warner trophy on ground level of the Pagoda. That shiny relic valued at $1 million is permanently housed at the IMS Museum but was hoisted into Victory Circle on Sunday — as it is each May by the winner. This time Helio Castroneves got the honors.

Floor 2: Race mission specialists

It's funny said IndyCar president Jay Frye at any other sporting event officials are on the field on the ice on the court. But with IndyCar the main officiating happens in this room on the second floor of the Pagoda called race control.

Officials are around the field in pit row out in the corners but the race control room has the means with access to 100 cameras and so much more to make the critical calls.

""If you're standing in Turn 4 on top of the grandstands"" said Frye ""we can look at your eyes from these cameras.""

So much goes on in this one control room which was filled with about 15 people Sunday who helped pull off the race.

There is Jim Norman who specializes in safety on the track. At any given time he could have as many as 60 people in his ear.

""Say we have a wreck an incident of course we don't want to see those but we're racing so we have them"" said Novak. ""Jim's going to put all the safety trucks out there if they need an ambulance if they need a tow truck he's going to coordinate all that.""

More:Sebastien Bourdais: 'It's pretty straightforward simple that I'd be dead'

Dave Price is in charge of the observers people who are stationed around the track in the stands. Before the advent of video that's all the Indy 500 had. And still today those observers are critical to the race.

Many of the caution calls such as a car crashing in Turn 1 come from observers who see it happen right in front of them. ""Yellow yellow yellow"" the call from the observer will come across.

They can also spot tiny issues such as pieces of carbon fiber or a bolt on the track. ""We have all of our cameras"" Novak said. ""They still can't see those kind of things that the human eye can see.""

Presiding over race control communications is Jim Swintal who delivers information to teams pit lane officials to the pace car as to what's happening on the track where the incidents are when the penalties are called.

""I like to think if the race were a movie I'd be the narrator"" he said. ""I try to make sure they're not guessing what we're going to do next when we're going to go back when we're going to clean up after an incident.""

There are 30 or so antennas around the track and Gary Barnard race control data analyst has his eye on the information coming in.

Each car has a unique transponder so as a car crosses each line it makes a record of that crossing. Barnard tracks the movement of the cars and the order of the cars. When there is a caution period he is the person who makes sure the cars are in the right order when they start back up.

""Sometimes"" he said ""It's easier than others.""

Two people in race control including John Maesky are called red hats. They have the direct line to the NBC production truck and make all communication from the control room to that truck.

""They're doing the live broadcast. They are going to breaks. We've got to make sure they're catching all the action"" said Maesky.

Any calls or decisions that are made by Novak and the team Maesky lets NBC know. He helps coordinate so when they come off breaks they are catching a live re-start.

Race control is like one big race orchestra performing in one tiny space.

""The great part about being in this room on race day is you'll hear the roar of the crowd the roar of the engines but it's almost like you might as well be 1000 miles away"" Novak said. ""And that's a good thing because our focus needs to be on the safety of the drivers.""

Floor 2: Timing scoring 'lots going on'

Sheron Arnold an IndyCar booth operator with scoring and timing sits just outside the race control room overlooking the yard of bricks.

It is her job among plenty of other things to keep track of how many times each car passes the start/finish line. IndyCar times its races to 10 thousandths of a second the only series to do that — Formula One doesn't NASCAR doesn't.

""And we need to do that because we have had ties before"" Arnold said. ""That's how competitive our cars are.""

Timing and scoring is a complicated intense operation. It runs three systems simultaneously in case something happens. One system goes down the department can simultaneously switch over to a mirror image system. They run on separate servers and are all backed up.

What might be the coolest things happening in this department though are the photos of the cars. Each car has a tiny transponder inside and wires are embedded by the start/finish line. When the nose of the car is on the bricks the transponder hits.

A start/finish camera (hanging in the ceiling just down from the timing and scoring booth) is also a timing device. That camera takes a pixel every ten thousandth of a second.

So every single time a car crosses that line 1000 photos of it are taken — very very small slices that build up to a whole car. A close finish? No problem that car is divided into 1000 pieces.

It happened in Fontana not too long ago said Arnold. A finish was so close two cars crossed simultaneously and one system picked up one car and another system picked up the other car. They went to the camera to see who really finished first.

Around the corner from timing and scoring is what used to be a broom closet now IMS president Doug Boles' on-track office. Next to that is what he calls the war room where should an unexpected event happen a group of people from communication race control PA safety and security would gather to hash it out.

Facing the track on Floor 2 is a room built out specially in 2019 when Matt Damon and Christian Bale came to the Indy 500 with their families. The space allowed them to walk right out to the pre-race festivities they were part of and then right back with their families to watch the race.

The second floor also features the PA booth and a driver green room. ""Without a doubt Floor 2"" said Boles ""has lots going on.""

Floor 3: A sweet suite and a DJ

The suite of NTT the title sponsor of the IndyCar series has a space like nothing else in the Pagoda said Boles. It's low and on the deck guests are right above the track. Outside seating has bleachers that face the racetrack so suite goers can see more up high.

The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation or NTT is a Japanese telecommunications company headquartered in Tokyo. It became the title sponsor for IndyCar in 2019 after Verizon told the series it wouldn't renew its contract after the 2018 season. Verizon was title sponsor for five years replacing IZOD in 2014.

Before the race Sunday on the deck of the third floor overlooking the yard of bricks DJ Slater Hogan entertained fans. Tapped by IMS in an elite gig he soaked it all in. As the music played Hogan danced to the beat as did race fans all around.

Floors 4/5: No biggie — just ambassadors

What better place to show off Indianapolis to a company you hope to bring to the city than to invite them to IMS on Indy 500 Sunday?

The Indiana Economic Development Corporation uses its suite in the Pagoda taking up both floors four and five just for that said chief of staff Luke Bosso.

""There is no better product for business development than the Speedway"" he said. ""It's one of a kind.""

On Sunday ambassadors from Italy Japan and Hungary were in the suite. Gov. Eric Holcomb likes to make sure guests of the IEDC suite arrive early so they have time for all the fanfare of the Indy 500 including tours of the pits and garages.

""Gov. Holcomb is happiest when he's here"" Bosso said. ""He loves it. He loves showing it off.""

IDEC has a list of top prospects companies it is trying to lureto Indiana and it invites to the Indy 500 to schmooze. In addition officials from Eli Lilly Cummins and other major companies in Indiana and worldwide will be inside.

""I'd love to say it's a big networking event"" said Bosso. ""But when the cars are going around it's 10 seconds of talking then the cars go..."" and attention turns to the track.

""When you get people here they are just amazed by it"" he said. ""That first lap all 33 cars coming and people are hooked.""

IDEC then hopes they get hooked enough to call the state their new business home.

Floors 6/7: They call it IMS Suite 67

Taking up two full floors of the pagoda at IMS is an ultra glamorous space that could be mistaken for an upscale restaurant if not for that massive track beyond the window.

Suite 67 is where Penske and IMS entertain key partners sponsors dignitaries and celebrities. On the sixth floor is a display of food and drinks and on the seventh floor a bar area where those people socialize.

Suite 67 — named for its location on levels six and seven — is 4200-square feet holds up to 360 people and is ""really the most exclusive space we have"" said Boles.

There is a deck on both sides and stadium seats out front that offer a one-of-a-kind vantage point of the track — the start/finish line flag stand and pre-race fanfare all unfold below. Out the back of the suite is a view of the downtown skyline.

""For people to come out and realize we are in the middle of a big city..."" Boles said. ""We aren't like a normal oval track in the middle of nowhere.""

Floor 8: A one-man suite

Stuart Reed has the only suite in the Pagoda that is more individual than company-driven said Boles.

But as co-owner of Ed Carpenter Racing Reed's suite is pretty much an Ed Carpenter and Tony George — the other two owners of Ed Carpenter Racing — suite.

Floor 9: Pagoda command big boards

A fan in the stands who calls 9-1-1 that call gets diverted to Pagoda command. A spectator who is dangerously intoxicated and refusing treatment is reported to Pagoda command.

The ninth floor is where law enforcement local to federal operate along with medical EMS safety patrol (also known as ""yellow shirts"") and operations.

Where Mike Bates sits as head of security at IMS he sees it as a true collaboration. On race day secret service FBI TSA FAA National Weather Service District Attorney's office all are there.

""We've got a complement of people that would help support in the worst-case scenario"" Bates said.

Those dogs that sniff cars before they enter IMS to make sure there are no bombs or explosives floor nine is part of that. In 2019 there were 32 dogs sniffing twice the number the at the Super Bowl Bates said.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security ranks the Indy 500 level 2 on its special event assessment rating (SEAR). That means it's a ""significant event with national and/or international importance that may require some level of federal interagency support.""

Speedway Police Chief Jim Campbell who takes his post on floor nine said he is proud of the collaboration among his department IMPD Marion County Sherriff Department and the state police.

What happens on Pagoda command on race day Campbell said is ""hopefully nothing.""

But things do happen. There are hundreds of thousands of people in one place after all.

""After the race ends on Sunday I always sit back and say 'Geez how'd we do that?"" said Bates.

David Letherman thinks the same thing as manager of logistics manager and event operations at IMS. He is in charge of the 580 safety patrol folks in yellow shirts and he and his team operate from the ninth floor.

Those safety patrol workers are responsible for driving golf cars parking manning elevators ushering in the stands scanning tickets at gates traffic parking and direction on the inside of the track and outside lot parking checking credentials in suites garage and pits and traffic movement.

If a bus breaks down and needs to get out of the way Letherman's group does that. If a scanner goes down he'll talk to the ticket office to get a new one. The people in yellow shirts have so much institutional knowledge of the Indy 500 and the track that often they are calling important issues in he said.

His team communicates minute by minute with the yellow shirts who are out and about.

""If you are up here on race day at 5 a.m. every single person up here would be on the phone texting on the radio"" said Austin Pontius senior manager of event personnel. ""It's amazing.""

On the other side of floor nine is the operations side. The medical staff the call-takers dispatchers. If there is an incident at an intersection this team helps divert traffic. INDOT is there state excise police undercover. On race day up to 40 people sit in this room.

""All the decisions kind of come from this room up here"" said Jason Dierdorff captain of Speedway Police.

The ninth floor is also home to TV; the NBC studio overlooks the track. The IMS radio network is housed on this floor too.

And all those big boards fans see as they walk about IMS are controlled from the ninth floor of the Pagoda. The man in charge is Rich Feinberg now with IMS but for years the producer of ABC's Indy 500 coverage.

There are 43 boards on the property he and his team must populate. What is displayed on each screen depends upon what's happening that day.

""When there are cars on the track we are trying to educate our fans as to the competition"" Feinberg said. ""When it's pre-race we're trying to entertain them. We think of it as we're their binoculars.""

The track is so big it's impossible for a fan to see everything that is happening as it would be at a football game or concert.

""We want them to experience everything so we try to be the eyes for them on what's important"" he said.

Floor 10: Celebs hang out

Inside the penthouse suite on floor 10 Sunday former Atlanta Hawks player Kevin Willis and gold medal Olympian sprinter Justin Gatlin mingled. After he waved the green flag ""This Is Us"" star Milo Ventimiglia came up to hang out.

This is Gainbridge's suite the title sponsor of the Indy 500 and it settles for nothing less than spectacular inside the smallest suite (the Pagoda floors get smaller the higher they are) in the house.

Each year a group comes in and completely transforms the space from the walls to the lighting.

""We bring it all in and then we strip it all down when we're done"" said Melissa Jacobs senior vice president of sponsorships and corporate communications for Gainbridge and its parent company Group 1001.

The suite on Sunday morning had a breakfast buffet of red chili beef bacon potatoes and scrambled eggs. The space isn't a bunch of cocktail tables scattered about but is interactive with sectionals and a massive TV to livestream the NBC coverage. DJ Gabby Love entertained the group of about 80.

Decor includes car parts shoes and gloves of Colton Herta with Andretti Autosport who drives the No. 26 Gainbridge Honda.

But what might be the best part of the suite said Jacobs is that view from the deck.

""Except for the front straightaway"" she said. ""You can see all the way around.""

Up on the roof: Penske soaks it in

The roof is an exclusive place at the peak of the pagoda. Few get up there. And those who do have important roles.

During the national anthem officials managing the flyover take to the top of the pagoda to guide the U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jets from the 187th Fighter Wing soaring over IMS. It's their best vantage point to see what they need to see said Boles talking to the television programs listening to what's going on and talking to the pilots.

Other who's who of Indiana often get a chance. Sometimes Gov. Holcomb will bring up an ambassador or two.

And finally high atop the tiny roof Penske takes his place on race day — maybe for five minutes. Maybe for 15. Maybe longer. Maybe more than once throughout the running of IndyCar's showcase. He likes to stand and soak it all in from that viewpoint said Boles.

To soak in just how spectacular it all is.

Most visits to the memory center where I care for individuals living with Alzheimer’s disease end in disappointment.

“Are there any new treatments Dr. Karlawish?” patients or family members hopefully ask.

I shake my head and say “No.”

I’ve been saying that for the past 18 years.

The few drug treatments I do prescribe are only modestly effective in easing the disease’s cognitive problems. None of them slow its relentless chipping away at individuals’ ability to control their lives or their caregivers’ steady accumulation of commitments of time and task.

So you might think that I’m among those hoping the FDA will approve aducanumab an experimental Alzheimer’s drug developed by Biogen a decision the agency is supposed to make by June 7.

But I’m not. And if it gets the green light I can’t see myself recommending it to my patients. Colleagues of mine in the Alzheimer’s sphere are also reluctant about approving aducanumab. Why? Biogen hasn’t made a convincing case for it.

The consequences of FDA approval are as disturbing as they are vast. Around 2 million Americans could be prescribed aducanumab at an estimated cost that ranges from $20000 to $50000 per person per year. Biogen claims the benefits of slowing declines in cognition and day-to-day function are worth this price. I think the company is wrong and I agree with the analyses by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review; the data to make this case are murky and even if they were clear the drug’s benefits are ambiguous at best and not worth this cost. Putting it on the market will stress Medicare’s resources.

These marginal benefits mean that if aducanumab is approved patients and families will struggle over whether it’s right for them. One of its risks is small bleeds in the brain a risk that is heightened in those with the APOE4 gene a gene associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Families will be drawn into these risk-benefit discussions because treating a parent’s Alzheimer’s with aducanumab may well mean their children will learn their genetic risk of developing the disease. I have little doubt that these at-risk individuals will push the margins of when to begin prescribing aducanumab.

Aducanumab is not the drug to launch a new era of Alzheimer’s treatment. It hasn’t been properly studied and so the FDA has incomplete data to form a judgment. The cause of this is a series of decisions that were good for business but bad for science and patient care.

Aducanumab started with a bang. On September 1 2016 the cover of Nature the prestigious “international journal of science” ran an all-caps headline: “TARGETING AMYLOID.” Inside were the results of a study that showed aducanumab cleared amyloid a protein thought to cause the destruction of brain cells in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Even more exciting the study suggested — but did not prove — that reducing amyloid might slow declines in memory and other cognitive abilities. An accompanying editorial proclaimed that confirming this result would be a “game changer in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease.”

Following these results Biogen launched two identically designed late-phase clinical trials one called ENGAGE the other EMERGE. Those studies however have created an imbroglio. There are two root causes for it.

One cause is that the FDA allowed Biogen to skip a crucial step in drug development: the Phase 2 trial a “learn and confirm” study to assure that the final phase of testing (Phase 3) will make a convincing case that the drug should be marketed to providers and patients. Phase 2 results are an opportunity to learn how to dose a drug to achieve the right balance of safety and benefit a fact of great importance for aducanumab.

Skipping Phase 2 meant that the two Phase 3 trials weren’t informed by good information about effective doses of the drug. In fact as ENGAGE and EMERGE enrolled participants Biogen learned more about dosing and so had to amend the instructions on the dosage given to those who were APOE4 carriers.

The other cause of confusion is that a planned interim look at the trials’ results only made things worse. This analysis of interim data was done to decide whether the studies were “futile.”

In clinical care futility describes care that no longer has a chance of benefitting a patient. It’s a controversial concept because it relies on the often seriously ill patient their family and their clinicians aligning around a common perception of both the benefit of care and the chances of success.

Futility analyses are also controversial in pharmaceutical research. Companies defend them as part of the business of research. Each day of conducting a clinical trial costs money often lots of it. Time and money spent on a study that won’t succeed is time and money wasted. Cut your losses and move on to the next drug.

I disagree with that approach and am bothered that futility analyses are becoming a more routine part of late-phase Alzheimer’s disease clinical trials. I’m not convinced that they save money because by the time a futility analysis is executed much of the money has already been spent on recruitment and other study procedures.

A negative trial is a disappointment and the Alzheimer’s field has lots of them. But even these trials make discoveries that inform the design of other studies. Stopping early to save some money leaves the field with an incomplete data set and this is precisely what vexes the analyses of aducanumab.

Skipping the learn-and-confirm phase and then performing a futility analysis unleashed a frustrating series of events none of which have benefitted the discovery of better treatments for Alzheimer’s disease. On March 21 2019 Biogen announced that the futility analysis supported shutting down ENGAGE and EMERGE. The price of a share of Biogen stock dropped from $320 to $226.

Aducanumab was finished.

But then it wasn’t.

In the three months between when the data set was locked for the futility analyses and the announcement of their results more data came in from 318 participants who completed the trials. The company took another look at this larger data set.

Seven months after its March reveal Biogen announced it had changed its mind. Aducanumab looked to be effective and the company was going to submit its data to the FDA for approval. The stock price returned to its pre-March 21 value.

And just what was this new good news? New results from EMERGE showed that participants who received the high dose of aducanumab outperformed those getting placebo on a measure that blends assessments of cognition and function. No such differences were seen in ENGAGE.

Biogen’s application for approval divided the FDA. At a November 6 meeting of the advisory committee reviewing the application Dr. Billy Dunn director of the FDA’s Office of Neuroscience spoke in favor of approving aducanumab. Tristan Massie a statistician in Dunn’s office concluded the opposite. The advisory committee sided with the statistician and voted overwhelmingly against approval.

In January Biogen issued a cryptic announcement. In response to an information request from the FDA the company had submitted still more data and analyses — the details aren’t publicly known — and said the FDA was pushing its decision from March to June 7.

The crux of the confusion over aducanumab? The data. They’re incomplete and contradictory.

Advocates of aducanumab have tried to explain away the contradictory findings from EMERGE and ENGAGE — clinical trials that tested the same drug on similar populations — with sophisticated statistical analyses. But these kinds of subgroup and responder analyses should be used to generate hypotheses for further study not to decide if a drug is safe and effective for treating people with Alzheimer’s disease.

None of this had to happen. Skipping a key phase of research and performing a futility analysis weren’t scientific decisions; they were business decisions about the pace of research to discover an effective Alzheimer’s treatment and how much a company will spend to sustain that pace.

Ironically approval of aducanumab will likely slow the pace of discovery. A person who’s willing to take on risks and uncertainties will likely choose the guarantee of taking aducanumab instead of enrolling in a clinical trial.

People with Alzheimer’s and their families are desperate for effective treatments for the disease. Aducanumab might be that treatment but we won’t know until Biogen invests the time and money needed to run well-designed trials and complete them. The day such a trial brings home positive results will be a turning point for my practice.

Visits to my memory center will no longer end with bad news but begin with good news: “There’s now a safe and effective Alzheimer’s treatment for you.”

Over 100 employees have joined a lawsuit against Houston Methodist hospital in Texas for requiring all employees to get the COVID-19 vaccine.

The network which oversees eight hospitals and has more than 26000 employees gave workers a deadline of June 7 to get the vaccine. If not staffers risk suspension and termination according to the lawsuit.

As a result 117 employees have joined a lawsuit filed Friday in Montgomery County that alleges the hospital is ""illegally requiring its employees to be injected with an experimental vaccine as a condition of employment.""

The lawsuit cited that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued its first emergency use authorization for COVID-19 in December 2020 but the vaccines are awaiting full FDA approval and licensing which will likely take months for the agency to review additional data.

The complaint cited that forcing employees to get the vaccine violates Nuremberg Code a medical ethics code which bans forced medical experiments and mandates voluntary consent.

Hospital CEO Dr. Marc Boom sent out a letter in April to staffers announcing that employees have to be vaccinated by June 7. ""Please see the HR policy that outlines the consequences of not being compliant by June 7 which include suspension and eventually termination"" the letter which was included in the lawsuit stated.

Attorney Jared Woodfill who filed the lawsuit told ABC News that Houston Methodist is forcing employees to get the shot to boost the hospital's profits.

""To promote its business and increase profits at the expense of other health care providers and their employees' health Defendants advertise to the public that they 'require all employees and employed physicians to get a COVID-19 vaccine.' More clearly Defendants' employees are being forced to serve as human 'guinea pigs' to increase Defendants' profits"" Woodfill said.

""It is a severe and blatant violation of the Nuremberg Code and the public policy of the state of Texas"" he added on the vaccine requirement.

The lawsuit says forcing the plaintiffs to take the vaccine violates public policy in Texas and requests a temporary injunction to prevent the hospital from terminating employees for refusing to get a vaccine shot.

When asked about alternative options for employees who did not want to get the COVID vaccine Houston Methodist told ABC News that it offered ""religious and medical exemptions as well as deferrals for pregnant women.""

The Equal Opportunity Employment Commission a federal government agency that protects workers from discrimination issued a new guidance Friday that said employers can legally require COVID-19 vaccines to re-enter a physical workplace as long as they follow requirements to find alternative arrangements for employees unable to get vaccinated for medical reasons or religious beliefs.

Some of those accommodations may be allowing an unvaccinated employee to wear a face mask and social distance while at work to work a modified shift get periodic tests for COVID-19 be given the opportunity to telework or accept a reassignment according to the guidance.

EEOC reminded employees in the document that they are legally protected from harassment such as anti-Asian bias or if they feel they are not being allowed to work because they are high risk from COVID-19.

Houston Methodist CEO Boom released a statement in response to the lawsuit Friday saying 99% of the network's employees have been vaccinated.

""It is unfortunate that the few remaining employees who refuse to get vaccinated and put our patients first are responding in this way"" he said in the statement sent to ABC News. ""It is legal for health care institutions to mandate vaccines as we have done with the flu vaccine since 2009. The COVID-19 vaccines have proven through rigorous trials to be very safe and very effective and are not experimental.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBybmV3c3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvbmV4dHVybi1iaW8taW5jLWFjcXVpcmVkLWEtNTAtc3Rha2UtaW4tcm9zdml2by10aGVyYXBldXRpY3MtaW5jLTMwMTMwMDYyMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nexturn Bio Inc. acquired a 50% stake in RosVivo Therapeutics Inc.,"SEOUL South Korea May 30 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Nexturn Bio Inc. a subsidiary of Nexturn Bioscience Co. Ltd. announced on May 26th that it had acquired a 50% stake in RosVivo Therapeutics Inc. (""Rosvivo"") an American new drug developer for about 5.5 million U.S. dollars.

As a result Nexturn Bio Inc. strengthens its capabilities as a bio-company by cooperating in the development of new medication pipelines utilizing miRNA technology to target diabetes obesity non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility and COVID-19.

Global Antidiabetics Pharma Companies and drugs

Nexturn Bio Inc. decided to invest in RosVivo and its miRNA technology through due diligence and valuation by industry-leading law firms patent corporations strategy consulting firms and domestic and overseas accounting firms. Nexturn also consulted with multiple key opinion leaders in endocrinology and gastroenterology and received positive feedback regarding the efficacy of the new drug.

According to a market report from Global Market Insights the global diabetes drugs market was valued at about $65.5 billion (USD) in 2019. The top global pharmaceutical companies such as AstraZeneca Novo Nordisk Eli Lilly and Sanofi have increased revenue by participating in the early stage development of diabetes drugs. This corresponds to an April 2020 study by GoodRx an American telemedicine platform providing comparisons of prescription drug prices which described diabetes as an expensive chronic disease. A diabetic patient spends approximately an average of $222 and $476 per month for non-insulin and insulin drugs.

However regardless of this high out-of-pocket expense conventional diabetes drugs today still have not solved the problem of frequent administration and various side effects. Many diabetic treatments depend on alleviating symptoms which is temporarily effective. Thus developing a drug to treat the fundamental cause of diabetes is urgently needed.

RosVivo's new miRNA drug RSVI-301 significantly reduces injection frequency showed a prolonged effect and alleviated side effects such as GI dysmotility in animal studies. It is expected that RSVI-301 will become a first-in-class diabetic drug.

""We consider this project not only as a successful investment but also as a great opportunity to develop an innovative diabetic treatment in collaboration with RosVivo"" said an official at Nexturn Bio Inc. ""We will do our best to demonstrate the market potential of RosVivo's miRNA-based pipelines as an innovative anti-diabetic medication.""

In addition to the anti-diabetic pipeline RSVI-301 RosVivo is planning to collaborate with established universities and healthcare institutions to start clinical trials for RosVivo's other treatment pipeline named RSVI-305/306 which will target COVID-19.

The request was swiftly denied. The application had been flagged because according to the credit file Monaghan recalls a store employee saying — matter-of-factly — she was dead.

The one who had in fact died was Monaghan’s late husband who had passed in September of 2017 after a seven-year battle with cancer. But as Monaghan says she later discovered a reporting error meant she had been recorded as deceased on her TransUnion credit report instead.

Monaghan’s story isn’t unique. Once credit bureaus are notified of someone’s passing they place a death notice on their credit reports a measure that helps prevent identity theft. But mistaken death reports do happen from time to time.

Story continues below advertisement

Monaghan though says it took her nearly two years from when she became aware of the error to be formally resuscitated in full. And during that time she says she had to live with a TransUnion credit score of zero.

Getting the mistake corrected she says has been ” a roller coaster ride” that left her “feeling insecure about financial stability.”

4:13 How your credit rating may be the wrong indication of your financial health

A 'rare' credit reporting mistake

Many consumers know to check their credit reports regularly with both of Canada’s credit bureaus TransUnion and Equifax. Credit reports a detailed history of a consumer’s use of credit contains essential information that both the two credit bureaus and lenders use to formulate credit scores which rate an individual’s creditworthiness. The two credit bureaus each have their own credit scores and lenders may use their own formulas to rate borrowers. In Monaghan’s case the error appeared only on the TransUnion report.

Credit report mistakes can result in lower credit scores and consumers who spot an error in their records are typically advised to promptly flag it with the credit bureaus.

But Monaghan says for almost two years her repeated attempts to correct the mistaken death report on her file led nowhere.

Global News has seen copies of the transmission log of a fax sent from Monaghan’s financial institution and addressed to both TransUnion and Equifax notifying them of her husband’s death shortly after his passing.

Monaghan also shared a copy of a letter sent by her bank via fax and addressed to TransUnion in September of 2020 confirming that she was in fact “alive and well.”

Financial news and insights delivered to your email every Saturday.

According to documents reviewed by Global News TransUnion opened at least two investigations into the matter in the fall of 2020. But even after the credit agency corrected the information about Monaghan being deceased her TransUnion credit score remained zero she says.

Making the process all the more taxing was a debilitating concussion Monaghan says she had suffered in February of 2019 an injury she says eventually forced her to go on disability leave.

“I really struggled to deal with … trying to convince them that I was alive dealing with the head injury” she says.

TransUnion has declined to comment on the specific of Monaghan’s case saying it can’t discuss an individual consumer’s situation due to privacy reasons. However it added it had reached out to Monaghan to address the issue.

“Mistaken reports of consumer deaths are rare but they do happen on occasion” the agency said via email. “TransUnion’s contact center will promptly correct a file on someone who has been reported to us incorrectly as deceased upon verification of a consumer’s identity. Consumers can reach TransUnion by phone at 1-800-663-9980.”

Shortly after Global News contacted TransUnion Canada Monaghan says the agency contacted her via phone and resolved the matter. A day later she says her TransUnion credit score had been restored.

4:07 Improving credit score

Living with a credit score of zero

As many Canadians know credit scores in Canada range from 300 to 900 with higher numbers on that scale usually making it easier and cheaper to access credit. Scores ranging from the mid-600s to the low 700s are usually regarded as “good.” Lenders are likely to see those with lower scores as higher-risk borrowers.

Story continues below advertisement

A credit score of zero though usually means there isn’t enough credit information to formulate a score.

But Monaghan says the knowledge that “zero” indicates a lack of credit history rather than very poor financial habits was little consolation.

“It’s really embarrassing” Monaghan told Global News speaking before TransUnion restored her credit score this past week.

There were also real-life consequences she says. Monaghan says that while she was able to continue to use the credit cards and line of credit she already had she couldn’t apply for new credit.

“I actually started to date somebody and we’ve considered selling his place and selling my place and starting fresh” she said speaking while her TransUnion credit score was still zero. However she added “I can’t qualify for a mortgage.”

Monaghan also says she borrowed from her line of credit and quickly repaid the money thinking the move would help her rebuild her score. It didn’t work.

But the very idea of having no credit history was frustrating she says.

“I’ve worked hard enough to have a good credit rating. I should be able to find a house and be able to say ‘I’m confident I could get the mortgage'” she said.

What can you do if no one fixes an error in your report?

Examples of credit report errors include incorrect personal information payments made on time reported as late or accounts listed that you never actually opened which can be a sign of identity theft.

While Canadians can order a free copy of their credit report from both TransUnion and Equifax via mail or telephone both credit agencies now allow consumers to also check their credit reports online free of charge.

If you spot a mistake on your report the first step is to ask the credit bureaus to correct it. Both credit-reporting agencies have an internal process to investigate credit report disputes. You’ll have to gather documents to support your claim.

It may also help to flag the issue to the lender responsible for the reporting mistake according to an online guide to addressing credit reporting mistakes by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC).

If the lender doesn’t agree there’s been a mistake or you’re dissatisfied with the results of the investigation by the credit bureau you can of course ask to speak to the manager.

But if escalating your case internally isn’t yielding results your next step depends on whether the lender is federally or provincially regulated. For federally-regulated lenders like the big banks you can turn to one of two external complaints bodies the Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investments ( OBSI) or ADR Chambers Banking Ombuds ( ADRBO ). You can ask your lender which of the two you should contact.

If you’re dealing with a provincially-regulated lender like a credit union you’ll have to turn to your provincial regulator says the FCAC.

If you believe the issue lies with the credit bureau you can file a formal complaint with them. If you need to take it further you can take your complaint to your provincial or territorial consumer affairs office as credit reporting agencies are provincially regulated. In Quebec send your complaint to the Commission d’accès à l’information du Québec ( CAIQ ).

Finally if all else fails you can lawyer up says Omar Ha-Redeye executive director of the Durham Community Legal Clinic in Oshawa Ont.

But legal action is the option of last resort he warns.

“It’s a lengthier process. It typically involves some money in terms of hiring a lawyer. And there’s an uncertain outcome” he says.

If you think you may have to go down that road put as much as you can in writing says Ha-Redeye. If you’re asked to speak on the phone type up your recollection of the conversation shortly after and mail it or email it to the lender or credit bureau to establish a written record of what was said he suggests.

“Having that type of information — with the date on the letter that’s very important — will demonstrate that you have been trying to make efforts all along to rectify the situation and to fix the problem with your you” he says.

Story continues below advertisement

And if you believe the credit reporting mistake has hurt you financially it’s helpful to try to document and quantify any financial damages or lost opportunities Ha-Redeye notes.

From her home on Georgian Bay though Monaghan says she’s relieved her credit score odyssey is finally over.

“The mistake has held me captive” she said via email. Now though she wrote “I feel freed.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

CoolGiftAtelier/Etsy



As more Americans receive the COVID-19 vaccine some cities and states are lifting mask mandates.

Now some people are looking for news ways to signal their support for COVID-19 precautions.

""Not a Republican just vaccinated"" merch is popping up on Etsy and one seller said they are her bestsellers.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

As mask mandates lift people are looking for new ways to signal that they're taking precautions against COVID-19 – and that they're not conservative.

An Etsy search for vaccine-related merchandise turns up countless results for t-shirts and wearable button pins many with a simple ""vaccinated"" message. But look a little further and there are dozens of items with some version of the following message: ""Not a Republican just vaccinated.""

Masks and especially mask mandates have been a divisive politically charged topic almost since the pandemic began. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first began recommending them to curb the spread of COVID-19 in April of last year.

Since then anti-mask rhetoric has largely come from citizens and politicians on the right side of the aisle. The states that never had mask mandates or had them for a very brief time period are almost exclusively red states. But since the CDC updated its recommendations mask mandates are dropping in most places.

Caroline who is based in Miami Florida and owns the Etsy shop CoolGiftAtelier said she received a custom request a couple of weeks ago from a customer interested in one of her pins that featured a rainbow and said ""Vaccinated You can hug me."" Instead the customer asked for the message: ""Not Republican just vaccinated.""

Caroline said she didn't totally understand why someone would ask for that message because she has been so busy with her kids and her three Etsy shops but she was happy to fulfill the customer's request. She also noticed there were already shirts being sold with the message but no pins.

""Then as soon as the listing was created something odd happened: my phone started sending notifications one after the other. 1 heart 2 hearts 3 hearts… A lot of people were adding the pin to their favorites"" she told Insider in a message.

""Then the sales kicked in. I think I received almost 50 orders in 1 day. A record for my brand new little Etsy shop"" Caroline said.

CoolGiftAtelier's most popular pins read: ""Not a Republican just vaccinated.""

CoolGiftAtelier/Etsy



She listed even more designs with the message and they have become her bestsellers.

More Etsy stores are picking up on the trend with lots of new listings popping up. The reviews for the pins are glowing as well with people saying things like ""So cute and much needed!"" and ""Such a cute pin! And sooooo needed LOL! I can't be mistaken for a you know what!!""

Katie an Etsy shopper who left one of the glowing reviews told Insider she wanted the pin because ""there was a fear of people misconstruing my intent when I do not have a mask on or pulled up.""







Now that she is vaccinated she does not always wear her mask when she is in spaces that are not very crowded or are outdoors but she doesn't want people to think she is anti-mask or anti-vax both of which have been associated with conservatives.

""It is very important to me that others know where I stand on politics health issues and racial injustice"" she said. ""I do not want others to assume that I am Republican because I would never want anyone to think I would do something so careless towards them like not wear a mask without being vaccinated.""

Caroline said she believes many of her customers feel the same way especially the ones who opt for the non-Republican pins over the far more neutral ""vaccinated"" ones that she offers. She pointed out the extremely mixed reactions to President Joe Biden's May 13 tweet: ""The rule is now simple: get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do.""

""It's easy to see how divided the nation is about this subject"" she said. ""People are definitely afraid of others' external assumptions.""

""This pin helps them communicate their 'fully vaccinated status' in a cute yet humorous political way"" she continued. ""There is definitely a 'belonging' component.'""

It can get hot back there and for good reason. All those machines require electricity too much for the building to handle while also keeping it cool back there. It has only 1200-amp service which has led to a couple of blown transformers outside the building.

Balloons & Festive Decor

If you want to add a festive touch to your barbeque go with balloons. We love the JoyyPop red white and blue bundle we found on Amazon which comes complete with confetti balloons. You can also take things up a notch with red white and blue tassels.

The Party Starter Drinks

Whether it’s mocktails or cocktails drinks should be flowing at your Memorial Day get-together. Consider making it easy on yourself and ordering from Drizly which delivers right to your door in hours and is a great way to track down liquor varieties that can be hard to find.

The limited-edition Ciroc’s new Summer Citrus is a great party starter as is Don Julio Blanco Tequila for summer margaritas.

You can always serve individual drinks in cups with lids or bottled water but if you want to make big batch cocktails mocktails lemonade etc. drink dispensers or pitchers can come in handy. Drink dispensers can keep your batch drinks safe from anything flying into it too.

“No matter if you’re disabled or normal whether you have lost your eyesight or you have no legs or hands it doesn’t matter as long as you have a strong mind you can always complete a thing that other people you can’t” Zhang told Reuters.

Zhang completed the 8849 metre-high Himalayan feat on May 24 along with three high altitude guides and returned to the base camp on Thursday.

Born in southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing Zhang lost his sight at the age of 21 due to glaucoma.

He was inspired by Erik Weihenmayer a blind American mountaineer who scaled Everest in 2001 and began training under the guidance of his mountain guide friend Qiang Zi.

Anonymous tips sent me to several locations early this spring to search out possible nesting sites but at every turn as the saying goes in the news business “nothing to see here.” This time it wasn’t a news tip but an invitation. A press release revealed the details.

Eversource had teamed up with MassWildlife to tag a pair of bald eagle chicks in a nest atop an osprey platform just off the power right of way. This was my kind of nature photography — be at 62 Farm to Market Road in Wareham at 10 a.m. and be ready for some eagle photos.

(The back story to this: Eversource workers had discovered eagles nesting on an osprey platform set up several years earlier. Usually osprey will chase off eagles but as the eagles start nesting much earlier this family had prevailed despite several osprey flyovers during our time there.)

Not wanting to sound too anxious I contacted Eversource media rep William Hinkle and left a voice mail to confirm my invitation in a calm nonchalant message. Even though Google map directions suggested a 30-minute drive time I allowed an hour which was a good thing. This is cranberry bog country. There was no specific street address so I drove by the small Eversource Crew sign several times.

Finally a winding dirt road led to a group of cars under the power lines. After a safety briefing about high-power-line protection zones we all queued up behind the bucket truck and walked to our vantage point. MassWidlife’s Jason Zimmer took the 50-foot aerial lift under the steady hand of Eversource’s Charlie Borkowski. The two chicks were quickly retrieved and brought down to the gathered crowd for tagging.

Both birds got a silver federal ID tag and a colored state tag. The first bird weighed in at 7 pounds the second at 6.5. At only 5 to 8 weeks old they already had plenty of artillery between their talons and beak but remained quite docile through their brief tagging and photo op. They were soon back on the nest and the crowd retreated down the road as the parents watched from a distant vantage point. Ten minutes later an adult arrived back checking on the chicks.

Lesson learned. From now on it is invitation-only for all bird photography.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhdHJpb3RsZWRnZXIuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNS8zMC9nYXMtZmlyZS1idXJucy0xMC1ob3Vycy1jcmV3cy1iYWNrLXNjZW5lLXN1bmRheS1tYXJzaGZpZWxkLzUyNzI3OTYwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gas fire burns for 10 hours crews back on scene Sunday in Marshfield,"MARSHFIELD — A gas leak that ignited in front of a house on Plain Street in Marshfield was finally extinguished Saturday night after burning for 10 hours.

Marshfield Fire Chief Jeff Simpson said in a Sunday telephone interview that the fire on Plain Street petered out at about 7 p.m. after utility crews capped a 6-inch gas pipe on near the fire and gas leak.

Police said 36 homes were without gas and only a few were without power after the fire was extinguished.

On Sunday morning Eversource crews were still at the scene working on the gas pipe but the road was open in both directions.

Simpson said it was not clear what caused the gas to first ignite but the ignition near the leak was better than if the gas had continued to escape.

After gas line was capped firefighters had to ventilate multiple homes where too much natural gas accumulated over the course of the day.

Simpson said the leaking gas migrated in the ground and firefighters used an estimated 300000 gallons of water to contain the spread of the gas to cool down the pavement and to make sure two homes closest to the fire did not ignite.

""We had to keep the road cool because the entire road became like a frying pan"" he said.

The gas line that caused the fire handles an ""unbelievable volume"" of gas.

The situation would have been much much worse if the gas migrated to different neighborhoods as it would have eventually combusted.

""We're not asking for it to happen again but we were able to control it we're good at that and when you have to chase it around chasing that volume it could have turned into a much bigger incident"" Simpson said.

Simpson said town officials across the spectrum as well as Eversource deserved credit for collaborating so well on a very complicated situation.

""It was a tough long mentally challenging day but in the end there were no injuries and that's the most important thing here"" he said.

One house experienced some water damage in its basement from the sheer volume of water pumped into the area to contain the gas.

Residents from homes within 200 feet of the fire and gas leak had to leave their houses while only two dwellings were in significant danger.

Simpson said they wanted to let the fire burn rather than putting it out because otherwise the natural gas would spread and possibly ignite somewhere else.

""We don't want that gas to drift into the other neighborhoods"" he said. ""If it's burning we can control it.""

Jennifer Fields who lives in a nearby home said she saw flames when she looked out the window Saturday morning and then heard fire engines and emergency vehicles arrive. Video she filmed of the gas leak showed a pillar of fire shooting up from a sidewalk.

“I was concerned for my neighbor’s house for fear it would burn” Fields said. “They have been pumping water on it all day long” because the flames were so close she said.

A man has been arrested after a woman’s body was found in a duffel bag that had been hidden inside of a storage unit for several months.

The incident began on May 12 when 64-year-old Debra Lynn Childers was reported missing to the Mohave County Sheriff’s Office by her son who lives out of state and had not heard from his mother in several months but knew that she lived in the Kingman and Golden Valley area of Arizona.

A police investigation into Childers who had reportedly been living out of her car found that a male had been withdrawing money from her bank account over the last several months but with no sign of Childers.

“During the week of May 24th KPD (Kingman Police Department) detectives began investigating the money withdrawals and attempting to identify the subject making the withdrawals” Kingman Police Department said in a statement. “It was also determined that this subject was driving the victim’s vehicle. There was immediate concern for Childers’ welfare.”

During the course of the investigation authorities were able to locate two storage units that belonged to Childers and served search warrants to inspect them on Friday May 28.

That is when the Kingman Police Department made the grisly discovery.

“Once inside detectives located a dead body believed to be Debra Childers” KPD said. “The body had been concealed in a large duffle bag and appeared to have been inside the storage unite for several months. Based on evidence and information investigators believe the body to be Debra Lynn Childers however official identification must be made by the Mohave County Medical Examiner’s Office.”

Childers’ family has been notified about the discovery of the body.

Brett Daniel Puett was arrested on May 28 2021 by the Kingman Police Department in Arizona and has been charged second degree murder after the body of Debra Lynn Childers 64 was found in a duffel bag inside a storage unit after her son reported her missing. Kingman Police Department/Facebook

Detectives have identified 35-year-old Brett Daniel Puett as the individual who had been driving her car and making withdrawals from Childers’ bank account over the previous several months and with the assistance of the Mohave County Sherriff’s Office as well as MAGNET detectives Puett was located and taken into custody without incident at approximately 5 p.m. on May 28 after he arrived to his own home driving Childers’ vehicle.

“Investigators learned that Puett and Childers met each other last summer while both had been living out of their vehicles” Kingman Police Department said. “Childers was shot and killed some time in November while Puett and Childers were sharing a room at a motel in … Kingman. It is believed that their relationship was platonic.”

Authotities say that Puett has since admitted his involvement in the killing and money withdrawals as well as transporting and concealing her body in the storage unit for several months.

Puett has been charged with felony charges of second degree murder abandonment and concealment of a dead body and fraudulent schemes and artifices.

No other additional suspects are being sought and Puett has been booked into the Mohave County Adult Detention Facility as the investigation continues.

It’s little wonder that the promise of limitless free capacity quickly caught the attention of serial snappers. Provided you were happy to accept a cap on quality – which at 16MP was hardly extreme – the search giant would safely stash copies of all your precious snaps online.

Alas all good things must come to an end – including generous complimentary cloud storage allowances. Unless you’re the proud owner of a Pixel handset unlimited space for ‘high quality’ images will end on 1 June 2021. Any ‘high quality’ shots uploaded to Google Photos after that date will count towards your free 15GB account limit.

Already uploaded your entire library? Don’t panic: any snaps backed up before 1 June 2021 will not count towards the total. But you’ll still face a problem if you’re close to the limit. Hit 15GB with future uploads of any quality and you’ll have to make a choice: create space by deleting superfluous shots or pay to upgrade your account capacity.

If the new rules will have you reaching for your wallet it might be time to ask whether you should stick with Google Photos or quit the service in favor of an alternative photo backup service. Which is exactly the question we’ll explore below.

Is Google Photos good value?

Let’s get one thing straight: 15GB of complimentary cloud photo storage is a fantastic offer. Sure it’s not the same as unlimited capacity but 15GB is still more than any other mainstream provider currently promises for free: OneDrive iCloud and Amazon Photos all offer just 5GB of storage. So if you’re looking for the most generous image backup solution Google Photos remains the top choice if you don’t want to spend a dime.

Even if your shooting habits mean you do need to expand your account capacity the cheapest Google One subscription tier compares favorably to the upgrade fees of rival backup providers. For the sum of $1.99 / £1.59 / AU$2.49 per month you’ll get 100GB of storage capacity across all Google products including Google Drive. That’s a good chunk of space at a pocket-money price. And that’s for image files of any quality including uncompressed originals. By comparison Apple’s iCloud backup offers a broadly equivalent 50GB for $0.99 / £0.79 / AU$1.49 or 200GB for $2.99 / £2.49 / AU$4.49.

It’s a similar situation for higher capacities. The 2TB Google One plan will set you back $9.99 / £7.99 / AU$12.49 per month. That’s slightly more than the equivalent iCloud plan but less than or comparable to most other cloud photo backup options on a monthly basis. There is cheaper cloud storage out there but not with the same smart features and cross-platform accessibility offered by Google Photos.

In short if your image library is already stored on Google Photos – and it’s less than 2TB in size – you’ll struggle to find cheaper expansion options than the ones offered by Google. More to the point any marginal saving is unlikely to justify the significant time effort and bandwidth that will probably be involved in downloading and transferring all of your uploaded shots to an alternative backup provider – unless they’re supported by Google’s Takeout service (which iCloud and Amazon Photos are not).

That all changes if your library is bigger. Above 2TB the next Google One tier is 10TB which carries a significant cost increase. And that’s where Amazon Photos enters the equation. For the single monthly fee of US$12.99 / £7.99 an Amazon Prime subscription bags you free fast delivery and access to Amazon’s library of video content. More importantly it also includes unlimited free storage space for full-resolution images.

Amazon’s photo backup service isn’t quite as slick as Google Photos. But it is a real steal for those with sizeable libraries. With dedicated smartphone and Fire device apps it’s also just as accessible. If your image collection will continue to grow it’s well worth considering – even if you don’t plan on using the additional subscription benefits. Note that unlimited image storage isn’t available to Prime members in Australia.

Google Photos is a very smart way to store your photos

Rivals aside Google Photos does plenty to justify a modest monthly fee. Paying for a Google One subscription technically does nothing more than net you extra storage capacity. But in reality it means you can continue to use the smart skills of Google Photos to sort edit and share images from across your collection.

Google Photos scores top marks for both ease of use and intelligence. If your images are already stored with Google you’ll know that it’s so much more than a space to simply dump your photo files.

Sorting is a cinch thanks to favorites and custom albums. Google will even help to keep your images in order by suggesting smart albums based on detected events. You can archive snaps to hide them from the main feed without deleting them – ideal for de-cluttering – while an incoming tool to identify out-of-focus and underexposed images will make it easier to scrap sub-par snaps.

Images can be edited directly in the cloud too using Google’s preset filters or the arsenal of adjustment sliders. And the real boon is the ‘Auto’ filter which brings out the very best in a given image with just a single click.

Search tools also make it straightforward to find particular pictures. You can filter by image type – think screenshots and selfies – or locate photos from a certain place. Object recognition even allows you to search for snaps based on what they contain from pets to parks to airplanes. It’s a highly effective and time-saving tool. Likewise you can label the faces of your friends and Google will find them wherever they’re lurking in your library.

Google Photos also lets you get creative with the option to make collages slideshows and animations from your images while integrated sharing options mean it’s a cinch to send the results to friends and family.

Granted a lot of these features are not unique to Google Photos. Both iCloud and Amazon Photos offer smart search functionality for example as well sorting and sharing tools. But neither of those offer a feature superior to something Google Photos can do – and certainly nothing that justifies quitting it in favor of a killer skill found elsewhere.

Google Photos is a compelling photo backup package. It’s easy to use yet offers a comprehensive set of features that are neatly integrated and very effective – arguably more so than its rivals when it comes to object and face recognition (although that’s difficult to objectively quantify). If you need to pay a small monthly fee to continue using the platform you certainly get your money’s worth when it comes to usability and versatility.

Google Photos integrates seamlessly across most devices

Flexibility is another reason to stick with Google Photos. Besides web browser access Google Photos is available as an app for PC Mac Android and iOS. That means it’s incredibly simple to backup and sync your entire photo collection across any and all of your devices. The desktop solution works well for syncing snaps from your hard drive while the mobile apps make it easy to automatically upload every image that you shoot.

For Android users Google Photos continues to be a no-brainer. In one form or another you’ll find it baked right into your Android device. Equally for iPad or iPhone owners Google Photos represents an excellent substitute for the default Photos app. It’s as accessible as the stock Apple offering and integrates just as seamlessly. You can dive right into your image library making use of the same searching sorting and editing tools mentioned above as well as additional features – including reverse image search powered by Google Lens.

Of course plenty of other photo cloud backup providers offer apps that work across multiple platforms. That alone is not a justification to continue using Google Photos. But the fact that the Google Photos apps are so easy to use on different devices is a major selling point for a service that is also smart feature-packed and affordable. And that’s especially true if you’re already familiar with the style and setup of Google’s interface and navigation menus.

Google Photos also plays nice with other Google products such as Google Drive and Docs which is handy if those form part of your online workflow. It’s also straightforward to create a copy of your entire Google Photos library using Google’s Takeout service. This is a big bonus if you want to make a offline backup of your image collection for added security. Neither iCloud nor Amazon Photos make it as simple to export all of your uploaded images to a hard drive.

Should you quit Google Photos in 2021?*

(Image credit: Google)

It really depends on your situation. If you have a Nexus device you should absolutely stick with Google Photos because you’ll continue to receive unlimited free storage for ‘high quality’ photos after 1 June 2021.

If you don’t have a Nexus device the question then is whether your usage will take you over the 15GB free allowance that every Google account gets. If it won’t definitely don’t quit Google Photos: 15GB is more generous than any other complimentary cloud backup capacity – not to mention all of the additional photo management features that you get to use for free.

If you simply must have unlimited storage space for your photos users in the UK or US have one clear alternative: Amazon Prime. For a reasonably affordable $12.99 / £7.99 per month you get limitless capacity for full-resolution photographs. That is undeniably a very good deal for individual users. In fact if you’re not already committed to a photo backup platform it’s pretty much the best value bundle you can get given the free delivery and video content perks that come with it.

But most people are already committed to a photo backup platform. And while it’s undoubtedly nice to have endless space available unlimited image storage will often be unnecessary for smartphone photographers: the efficiency of modern compression means file sizes can be kept pretty small. Because any ‘high quality’ shots uploaded to Google Photos prior to 1 June 2021 won’t count towards your account total most users will take a while to max out on even the most affordable 100GB subscription plan.

So if Google Photos is currently your platform of choice for image backups we think you shouldn’t quit. There are countless cloud storage alternatives some of which cost less for higher capacities. But few deliver the comprehensive and dedicated photographic functionality of Google Photos not to mention the seamless cross-platform integration of its apps as well as the ability to export your entire library to an offline drive. And with competitively priced expansion tiers there’s little reason to quit and make a time-consuming switch away from Google Photos.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9mYW1pbHkvbGlmZS9leHRlbnNpb24tZG91YmxlZC1wcmljZS1ob3VzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The extension that doubled the price of our house,"Twenty years ago my house had a major overhaul. Rooms were moved around bathrooms were added a new kitchen created and a loft extension notched up two extra bedrooms. Yes it was a filthy prolonged experience but I’ve never regretted it.

Truth be told I loved my builders. They took pride in the quality of their work and were chilled about the fact there was often a toddler running around obsessed with their toolbox and trying to stick a fat little finger somewhere they shouldn’t. I even have a photo of Brian the foreman holding my baby son while standing in the carcass of the roof. It was hectic but not without its joys and when the last lick of paint went on we drank champagne hugged goodbye and promised to stay in touch. If you’re reading this Brian where are you?

Yes my renovation has stood the test of time and now as the kids cobble together their shekels for their own places I am considering downsizing and cashing in. Obviously the increase in the value of my property is affected by its location the economy and the two decades I’ve lived here. But the revamp has played its part and I am quids in. It’s also worth adding that my reconfigured family abode has given me tons of space for glorious parties extra rooms for guests to conk out in and many many years of comfort and delight.

And after the tough year we’ve all endured being in love with your home is a thing. Because while we might be ecstatic to get out-out there is a common realisation that we all need a sanctuary to return to. Never before has the mantra “improve don’t move” been more relevant.

A Liverpool mum has wowed designers on Instagram with her ""amazing"" basement renovation.

Leah Tomprefa from Wavertree transformed her cellar into her dream space after getting fed up with the ""horrible and damp"" space.

Before the conversion the basement was just used for storage and Leah’s family would never go down there.

Now it has been made into a bar a games room and a cinema room that has been described as 'extraordinary.'

The mum-of-three has been doing up her home for more than a decade but had always prioritised other areas of the house.

It wasn’t until the cellar started to flood and cause her stress that she decided it was her next project.

The 42-year-old told the ECHO : ""It was literally just used for storage at first but it started flooding before we renovated it.

""We had to tank it because it was flooding to the ankles and every time it was flooding we had to pump it out.

(Image: Instagram @chronicles_on_the_crescent)

""My husband had buckets and we thought 'we can't go on like this'.""

Initially the cellar was going to be just a bar and a games room but once work started builders discovered a hidden room that the homeowners didn't know about.

Lead said they filled around 30 skips' worth of earth that had been dug out of the cellar.

(Image: Instagram @chronicles_on_the_crescent)

Once digging had begun she was surprised to find that there was a hidden room that had been filled in and bricked up. It is now the cinema room.

She said: ""It became apparent that there was another room I don't know what had happened but it had been dumped (in) almost to ceiling.

""We dug that out so it was an extra room. We ended up getting a whole new room we didn't have before.""

Leah added: ""We just used to use it for storage and it was horrible damp and dark and cold. You couldn't use it at all as a room before we just closed the door on it. Now it's a whole new part of the house.

""[The cellar] is the whole footprint of the house not a lot of houses have that so it's really rare.""

The basement renovation has attracted a lot of attention after Leah began to post the transformation journey to her home Instagram account @Chronicles_on_the_crescent.

Leah said: “Well I’m obsessed with home accounts and over lockdown. When we were doing our home I’d use Instagram to inform a lot of my decisions when it came to decor paint colours doors I would just use it as a decision maker.

“I would just hashtag search designs and message people and ask them about it so I thought I might as well do my own too.

If approved the Stabroek Block Yellow-tail Project will join the Liza-1 well which is in operation and the Liza-2 and Payara which are being developed.

“The questions and comments here are to help determine the terms of reference for the Yellowtail Project…the 28 days comments period ends June 5th so please send in what you want to see captured in the EIA” Esso Exploration & Production Guyana Limited (EEPGL) local Public and Government Affairs Spokesperson Janelle Persaud told an online consultation forum on Thursday evening.

“The EIA will give you a better idea of the cumulative impact and as more studies are done it adds to that” Project Manager Brian Schall added.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will select the entity to undertake the EIA and the public consultations are intended to help shape the areas of investigation. Even without public input the EIA is expected to address vexing issues such as gas flaring treatment of sea water used in oil extraction safeguards from spillage and the impact on biodiversity and marine life. These issues have not been comprehensively addressed in earlier EIAs for Liza-1 Liza-2 and Payara though the latter did contain enhancements in the Environmental Permit that was eventually issued.

At two Zoom meetings on Thursday ExxonMobil gave some insight into development plans for its fourth oil extraction well as it emphasized that the preservation of the environment was paramount to its operations. Given the heavy flaring from Liza-1 critics have questioned this commitment which has emanated from the oil company.

The EPA this month announced that the company has applied for an Environmen-tal Authorization to undertake the Yellowtail Development Project.

The agency said that it had determined that an EIA will have to be conducted before a decision to approve or reject the proposed project is made as it may significantly impact the environment.

As such members of the public were invited to make written submissions to the Agency outlining questions and matters which they need to be answered or considered in the EIA. The public was given 28 days to send in those concerns and that period ends on June 5th.

At Thursday evening’s scoping meeting businessman Vishnu Doerga told the virtual consultation meeting that he would want to know if the sizes and number of vessels offshore would have an impact on the environment.

“What is the likely impact the vessel size can have on the environment?” he asked.

Doerga and Kaieteur News Publisher Glenn Lall were the only two persons who submitted oral questions with Lall saying that he will send in additional concerns before the June 5th deadline.

Lall asked if the flaring provisions for the Yellowtail Project will be the same as for the other three wells.

Twenty years

According to its project summary the site will be located in the eastern portion of the Stabroek Block 200 km from Georgetown. Oil production from the Yellowtail Development Project is expected to last at least 20 years with approximately 45-55 wells to be drilled offshore to support extraction.

The summary which can be found both on the EPA’s and the company’s website and Facebook page states that the proposed project will develop the Yellowtail and Redtail fields and other resources if such is determined to be feasible and competitive. It was stated that Yellowtail will be designed to add up to 250000 barrels of oil per day (bpd) to existing daily production volumes in Guyana. ExxonMobil subsidiary Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited (EEPGL) said that during the early stage of production operations the Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) platform is anticipated to produce up to an average of approximately 6600000 – 7500000 barrels of crude oil per month. However these estimates are preliminary and are subject to change.

The Yellowtail Project hopes to realize the projected outputs through a process that involves drilling of production wells; installation commissioning and operations of Subsurface Umblicals Risers and Flowlines (SURF); a FPSO; and handling and offloading of produced hydrocarbons. It will utilise marine support vessels as well as onshore infrastructure including but not limited to shore bases warehouses storage and pipe yards fabrication facilities fuel supply facilities and waste management facilities in Guyana. These types of infrastructure will be used to support the drilling installation production operations and decommissioning stages of the well.

Approximately 1200 personnel will be employed offshore during the stage where the wells are being drilled and the offshore oil production facilities are being installed. This number will decrease to less than 200 personnel during the production operations phase. A smaller number will be utilized at the onshore support facilities.

Regarding flaring EEPGL said that this will only occur under very unique operational circumstances and that the FPSO will use treated sea water for cooling and injection into the reservoir for additional pressure maintenance and said that the water will be discharged overboard in line with the industry’s best practices. This plan by ExxonMobil has raised concerns in the past.

The project summary stated that once approved production is expected to begin in 2025. The FPSO will be capable of storing approximately 2 million barrels of oil. The FPSO will have living quarters and utilities needed to support operations personnel on the FPSO.

During the development of the EIA further public consultations are expected to occur.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vZGVtZXJhcmF3YXZlcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8zMC9jaXZpbC1kZWZlbmNlLWNvbW1pc3Npb24tZ2V0cy1neWQxMC1taWxsaW9uLXRvLWJvb3N0LWZsb29kLXJlbGllZi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Civil Defence Commission gets GYD$10 million to boost flood relief,"Last Updated on Sunday 30 May 2021 12:42 by Denis Chabrol

The Civil Defence Commission (CDC) on Sunday received a GYD$10 million donation from Mid-Atlantic Oil and Gas to be spent on flood relief operations countrywide officials said.

The cheque was handed over by Mid-Atlantic’s Corporate Secretary Glenn Low-a-Chee to the Director-General of the CDC Lt.Col. Kester Craig.

“Obviously we realize what’s going on with the flooding and we wanted to do our part as a good corporate citizen hence we made this donation in an effort to bring some relief to what is going on around the country with the flooding and the rain” he said.

Mr. Craig highlighted that the additional cash comes at a time when all 10 administrative regions are battling severe floods due to days of intense rainfall.

In particular the CDC Chief noted that Region 10 (Upper Demerara-Upper Berbice) and Region Six (Corentyne- Berbice) are worst affected.

From the look of things he said one or two emergency shelters would have to be opened at Kwakwani to cater for about 75 to 100 residents who are on the verge of being displaced from their homes.

Based on requests coming in from across the country the needs include food supplies cleaning and sanitation agents and mattresses. “We are not deciding how the money is being utilised. It’s based on the needs from the regions and the communities” the CDC Director-General said.

Shelters have been already established in Region Nine (Upper Takatu-Upper Essequibo)."

Much of the existing Huntington Shopping Center from Applebee’s to Buy Buy Baby will be demolished welcoming a new structure with a Whole Foods grocery store as the anchor tenant the plan goes.

But the site plan for the project must still be approved which Paul Mandelik chairman of the town Planning Board described as “very close to being ready” after it was modified following the Zoning Board of Appeals’ input.

“Currently it’s an old dilapidated outdated shopping center” Mandelik said of the 59-year-old plaza.

Earlier this month the Planning Board unanimously approved the architectural renderings and posed no objection to Federal Realty Investment Trust — the Maryland-based real estate firm that owns Huntington Shopping Center — filing for building permits through the town’s building department.

The renderings boast a wealth of updates to landscaping throughout the project.

The most notable change is a 40-foot landscape buffer on the New York Avenue side of the property where there currently sits what was described in the meeting as an unsightly dumpster-laden ground.

The designs are highlighted by fresh facades new outdoor seating areas wider sidewalks for shoppers to stroll down the new catty-corner structure.

While it will appear to the eye as a single building the reconstruction will actually consist of two structures connected at a point according to the notes of Christopher W. Robinson president of R&M Engineering a Huntington-based firm working on the renovations prior to a September ZBA meeting.

Behind the connection there is a proposed outdoor storage area for snow removal and maintenance equipment.

Plans also call for two new 8000 square-foot. standalone buildings which could feature restaurants or “higher-end boutique retail” said a representative for Federal Reality Michael McCarthy during the ZBA meeting.

McCarthy said that while the plans appeared “busy” the redevelopment actually reduces the retail space by about 22%. It was during this meeting he also mentioned Federal’s willingness to spend “in excess of $40 million” on the project.

A Whole Foods Market spokesperson confirmed the grocer chain from Austin Texas is developing a Huntington location but declined to offer any additional information.

It is still unclear what the immediate plans are for the existing tenants which includes Ulta Beauty Inc. Tillys Michaels Companies Inc. PetSmart and Nordstrom Rack the latter of which will shut its doors within two weeks of May 28 according to a company filing with the New York State Department of Labor.

Neither Federal Reality nor R&M Engineering responded to Greater Long Island’s request for comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Judge Esther Salas and her husband Mark described their only child Daniel as ""the center of their universe."" A twenty-year-old college sophomore who ""wanted to squeeze the joy out of every situation.""

On July 19 2020 the tight-knit family of three were in the basement cleaning-up from Daniel's birthday party when the doorbell rang at their New Jersey home. Daniel raced up the stairs to respond to a man dressed as a FedEx driver.

Moments later gunshots broke the silence of a quiet suburban street. Daniel shot in the chest lay at the foot of the front door. Mark shot three times was clinging to life on the porch.

Daniel died on the way to the hospital. Mark is still recovering from multiple surgeries.

Daniel Mark and Esther Salas

On 60 Minutes Judge Salas revealed harrowing details about the plot by a former plaintiff to assassinate the judge and possibly others.

""Who knows what could have happened? Salas said to correspondent Bill Whitaker. ""But we need to understand that judges are at risk. We need to understand that we put ourselves in great danger every day for doing our jobs…This fact has to wake us up.""

In the last five years threats made toward federal judges have increased 400%. Last year the threats totaled more than 4200.

The FBI investigation into Daniel's murder revealed the 72-year-old shooter Roy Den Hollander had been stalking the Salas family. He had notes about routes the judge took to work the school her son attended and where the family went to church.

The FBI also told Judge Salas that the wounds sustained by Daniel appear to indicate he was trying to block Hollander from getting to her.

Police found Hollander's body the day after he killed Daniel Salas. He committed suicide.

The information obtained by Hollander was accessed legally on the internet. Judge Salas is now advocating for new legislation to provide additional protection for federal judges.

The proposed legislation calls for more than $250 million worth of home security upgrades and the hiring of 1000 deputy marshals. It also calls for the online removal of personal data including home addresses driver's license information and property tax records.

The legislation is expected to be taken up by the Senate.

Half the time someone is unhappy with a judge's ruling. The normal recourse is an appeal. But in the caustic atmosphere of today's politics there's a real chance the disgruntled party will threaten the judge. In the last five years threats of federal judges have jumped 400% to more than 4000 last year – many of them death threats sometimes ending in violence. As we first reported earlier this year judges are breaking with tradition and publicly calling on lawmakers to provide more protection. One of the strongest voices is federal judge Esther Salas. Last July she was at home in New Jersey in the basement with her son Daniel cleaning up after his 20th birthday party when a man disguised as a FedEx driver pulled up outside.

Esther Salas: Danny turned around and he said ""Let's keep talking. I love talking to you mom."" And it was at that exact moment that the doorbell rang. And before I could stop him he just shot up the stairs. The next thing I hear is ""boom."" It just sounded like a mini bomb. And then I hear ""no."" And then I hear ""boom boom boom."" And I just screamed ""What is happening?"" When I got upstairs it was it was something no mother should ever see.

Daniel lying bleeding by the door; Mark her husband on his knees holding his side. Daniel was barely clinging to life.

Daniel Mark and Esther Salas

Esther Salas: I--I didn't even know what to do. I remember picking up his shirt and seeing the bullet hole. You know we were screaming ""Daniel hold on"" and ""don't leave us."" And then I just as I think about that day I just I realize I was watching my only child fade away.

Daniel died on the way to the hospital. Mark is lucky to be alive.

Bill Whitaker: How seriously injured was he?

Esther Salas: Mark was shot three times – in the – right chest left abdomen in the arm.

A close-knit family they called themselves the three musketeers. Judge Salas told us Daniel a college sophomore was the center of their universe. From his wounds the FBI said it appeared Daniel had tried to block the gunman.

Bill Whitaker: When did you realize that the attack was meant for you?

Esther Salas: It wasn't until the FBI debriefings. They'd looked at this case inside and out tell me ""Ma'am you were the target. He wanted to get you.""

The shooter was Roy Den Hollander a 72-year-old lawyer. He harbored deep hatred for women and left behind a bitter manifesto. He accused Judge Salas of being quote a ""lazy Latina"" dragging her feet on his lawsuit. Police found his body the next day he had shot himself. The FBI discovered he had killed another lawyer a week before. Then he went hunting for Judge Salas.

Esther Salas: He knew where obviously where I lived. He knew my routes to work. He knew the church we attended. He had Daniel's school. He knew baseball games. Just a complete work up on me and my family.

Bill Whitaker: The information that he got all from legal sources?

Esther Salas: All open sources they call it.

Judge Esther Salas

We met Judge Salas outside her home six months after Daniel's murder. She told us her husband needed additional surgery. The house has been sold. Twenty years of wonderful memories she told us and one that's excruciating.

Esther Salas in YouTube video: We're living every parent's worst nightmare making preparations to bury—bury our only child Daniel.

Last August in a highly unusual move for a federal judge Judge Salas made a personal plea to lawmakers on YouTube.

Esther Salas in YouTube video: We may not be able to stop something like this from happening again but we can make it hard for those who target us to track us down.

Since Daniel's funeral Judge Salas has become a crusader for federal legislation to scrub judges' personal information from the internet. Her mission became more urgent when the FBI discovered a second locker in New Jersey belonging to her son's killer.

Bill Whitaker: What did they find? What was in the locker?

Esther Salas: They found another gun a Glock more ammunition. But the most troubling thing they found was a manila folder with a workup on Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

Bill Whitaker: Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor?

Esther Salas: Yes. Chilling.

Bill Whitaker: What do you think when you find that a Supreme Court Justice was on his list?

Esther Salas: More than on his list on his sights. They had her favorite restaurants where she worked out her friends.

Our report was the first time that plot was revealed.

Esther Salas: Who knows what could have happened? But we need to understand that judges are at risk. We need to understand that we put ourselves in great danger every day for doing our jobs. This fact has to wake us up.

Judge Salas told us she never dreamed she'd be putting her family in harm's way when she was sworn in in 2011.

The last judicial security upgrade was 15 years ago—after Chicago Judge Joan Lefkow came home one night and found her husband and mother shot dead by a disgruntled plaintiff.

The new legislation to be taken up by the Senate is seeking more than $250 million for home security and 1000 more deputy marshals. It would erase a long list of personal data online – such as a home address driver's license and property tax records.

Bill Whitaker: You chose to be a judge. And in becoming a public person don't you have to give up some of your personal details for the sake of accountability?

Esther Salas: You're right I did choose to become a public servant. And if anyone has a problem with what I've ruled in a particular case they can appeal. If anyone is upset the courthouse address you know it's known to everyone. Come to the courthouse. But why do you need to come to my house?

We can't show you but U.S. marshals now provide round-the-clock security for Judge Salas. She told us judges are increasingly threatened online. Last year there were 4200 threats against federal judges. She read us a few of those.

Esther Salas: ""We"" quote ""must start killing these corrupt politicians and judges and their families"" end quote. Another one ""The judge is a traitor and has a death sentence.""

Bill Whitaker: And this is since the death of Daniel?

Esther Salas: This is since Daniel's murder in this very house. One other one just in Mississippi. Quote ""I will kill you. I just wanna get the gun and come down there and blow all their brains out.""

But perhaps no judge in the country has felt the heat of online threats more than senior U.S. District Judge James Robart.

Emotions were already running high when Judge Robart temporarily blocked former president trump's first travel ban barring some Muslim travelers. Critics posted his home phone and address online. But nothing prepared him for the tsunami of hate when president trump used his Twitter bully pulpit to scorn him as a ""so-called judge.""

Judge James Robart

James Robart: When you call someone a so-called judge what you do is you attack the judiciary. You may not even have wanted to convey that message but that's the message which your 40 million Twitter followers took down which was you were never authorized to issue this decision.

Death threats flooded in. Then President Trump tweeted again.

Bill Whitaker: If I recall he also said to blame you if there should be a terrorist attack on the country?

James Robart: People took that as somehow I was giving permission for their families to be endangered. And then the tone for a number of the messages turned into ""you must be stopped.""

Bill Whitaker: What did you think about that? When the president attacks you?

James Robart: I thought he had a right to attack my decision. I don't think that criticizing a judge is acceptable. I recognize there's a dispute on that. There is no dispute at the point that you start to talk about ""I'm going to kill you"" or ""I'm going to hurt you"" or more importantly to me ""I'm going to hurt your family"". That's over the line and can't be tolerated.

Judge Robart was bombarded with 40000 messages. 1100 were serious enough to be investigated. There were so many death threats that U.S. marshals set up camp around the judge's house.

James Robart: The idea of needing a you know bomb-sniffing dog to go into a restaurant before we could have lunch impacts you but you just try to you know not let that bother you.

Bill Whitaker: That actually happened?

James Robart: (laugh) Yes. If you wanna know how to be really unpopular with restaurant owners show up with your dog which runs around the restaurant barking. And a number of U.S. marshals who are noticeable.

Bill Whitaker: You're chuckling now but I take it that at the time you didn't see the humor in this?

James Robart: (sigh) No I didn't.

Then federal investigators uncovered something more ominous. Thousands of threats that looked to be from Americans – were actually from Russia part of a long game by Vladimir Putin to splinter American democracy.

Suzanne Spaulding: If Putin can undermine a significant segment of the population's willingness to accept a court's decision then he can cause chaos in this country.

Suzanne Spaulding ran top cybersecurity operations for both Democratic and Republican administrations. She told us Russia undermines the justice system by fanning some Americans' suspicions that judges are partisan.

Suzanne Spaulding

Bill Whitaker: What did Judge Robart do to put himself in Russia's crosshairs?

Suzanne Spaulding: They attacked him his decision as reflecting his personal political preferences as opposed to following the rule of law. And that leads people to conclude that it is appropriate to make threats of violence. And as we saw in the tragic case of Judge Salas to actually carry out an attack of violence.

Bill Whitaker: How big a threat do you think this is?

Suzanne Spaulding: You know I think we got a taste of that on January 6th.

Spaulding told us since the siege of the Capitol there's more pressure on law enforcement to determine which online threats might turn into physical attacks. Take the example of an Alabama man who answered the online call with a truckload of weapons and a hand-scribbled hit list -- second from the top an Indiana judge.

Bill Whitaker: So how do you answer people who will say that what I say online even if it's aggressive it's my First Amendment right?

Suzanne Spaulding: So you do have a First Amendment right to express your opinion even if it's an unpopular opinion. But threats of violence incitement to violence those are things that law enforcement can legitimately look into particularly when it's against our public servants.

Judge Salas lives with those threats. And now that the courthouse has reopened after COVID she told us Daniel would want her to keep going.

Bill Whitaker: Will you be concerned when you re-enter this courtroom?

Esther Salas: No we're changed forever. You know Mark and I are – are different people today sadly. But as far as what I do on the bench no that's not—I'm—that's not gonna change. I'm not gonna let Mr. Hollander take that away from me—my integrity my work ethic and my pride. No. He won't take that.

Despite promises to fast-track the new legislation the Senate still has not taken it up. Threats against federal judges have jumped 25% so far this year to over 1200.

Goalkeeper Rocco Ríos Novo had a season-high of six saves in the competition. The match was also Tony Annan’s final game with the club before he begins his next chapter as head coach for University of South Carolina.





ATL UTD 2 dominated possession in the first half with 62 percent compared to Birmingham’s 38 percent. Atlanta’s best chance came early in the fourth minute when Mikey Ambrose played a ball to Connor Stanley near the edge of the box. The forward then drove to the end line and cut the ball back to his right foot to fire a shot but it went to the side of the net.





Atlanta again had an early opportunity in the second half when Ronald Hernandez carved a defender on the right flank and served a cross into a crowded box where Aiden McFadden was able to get off a right-footed shot but it was blocked.





Ríos Novo had a busy second half as he faced five shots on target. One key save came in the 63rd minute when Bruno Lapa Broke loose and fired off a shot near the corner of the six-yard box but Ríos Novo pushed it off the near post and out of bounds.





Birmingham finally solved the 18-year-old keeper on a penalty kick. In the second minute of stoppage time the referee ruled that Tyler Wolff brought down Jaden Servania in the penalty box.

One of the lone bright spots was the performance of Roush Fenway Racing. Chris Buescher led Ford with an eighth-place finish his fourth top-10 of the season and third in the last five races as he marched through the field from his 27th starting position. Even though Ryan Newman ended up 27th he was battling for a top-10 spot as well before a cut tire sent him into the wall just before the end of Stage 3.

Kevin Harvick and his team kept grinding away coming out with a 10th-place finish while Brad Keselowski had another blue-collar effort in 11th. Joey Logano was in the same mix with Harvick Keselowski and Buescher but also had a tire go down with 79 laps to go and was forced to make an unscheduled pit stop under green. He finished 17th.

Only 14 cars finished on the lead lap after the 400-lap event as Kyle Larson swept all four stages and won for the second time this season.

The NASCAR Cup Series heads to California next Sunday for a road course event at Sonoma Raceway.

CHRIS BUESCHER No. 17 Fifth Third Bank Ford Mustang

“That was a heck of an effort by our team and Roush Fenway to get our Fifth Third Bank Ford Mustang from a 27th-place starting spot to eighth. We knew why we were there when it happened but to have that drive forward and get up to the top 10 and ride around there all night and be able to make up spots on long runs I’m proud of that. It’s a good night. It’s a long race. We executed really well on pit road. Everybody did a really nice job so I’m proud of that.”

HOW DID YOU GUYS DO AS FAR AS KEEPING UP WITH THE TRACK FROM DAY TO NIGHT?

“I would say I expected it to tighten up and we ended up freeing up. I think it was more of a product of what our balance was before so that’s something to keep in mind because I didn’t want to adjust it. I was afraid it would tighten up and get too tight but we really needed to do that so I got us behind on one of those runs but again I’m just proud of this group and everybody from Fastenal and Fifth Third and Castrol and Ford -- everybody that’s on board with us and making sure that we got what we need to go racing. We’re starting to chip away at it and knock down some of these top 10s.”

IT’S YOUR FOURTH TOP 10 FINISH AND IT’S LOOKING LIKE YOUR BEST SEASON TO DATE ON THE CUP LEVEL.

“Yeah we’re absolutely on our best season. This will be our best season no doubt no matter what happens from here but it’s only optimism from here on out. I think we’ve found a lot of baselines that have really helped us start better. Our execution has been really good. Everybody has just really put their heads down through the off-season and found speed in these race cars and it’s showing. On top of that we were right around the 6 all day too. We were both competitive today in the race. I know our qualifying effort wasn’t stellar but our race effort was strong.”

BRAD KESELOWSKI No. 2 Keystone Light Ford Mustang

“That was a blue collar night for sure. Jeremy and the guys on the Keystone Light team got us the best we were all night there at the end and we almost got a top-10.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91cnNwb3J0c2NlbnRyYWwuY29tL3NlcnZpY2VzL3JlbGVhc2VzL21hdGNoLXByZXZpZXctYXRsLXV0ZC0yLXZzLWJpcm1pbmdoYW0tbGVnaW9uLWZjL24tNTY5ODM0N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Match Preview: ATL UTD 2 vs. Birmingham Legion FC,"Match Preview: ATL UTD 2 vs. Birmingham Legion FC

The eclipse is famous for testing Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity. Einstein was relatively unknown at the time. He had proposed general relativity in 1915 and scientists had been intrigued by the entirely new way of thinking about gravity – for example the idea that mass causes space to curve – but no one had experimentally proven the theory to be correct. Then on May 29 1919 an expedition of English scientists – led by Sir Arthur Eddington – traveled to the island of Príncipe off the west coast of Africa to observe a total solar eclipse. If the theory were right the light from stars should be bent by the gravity of the sun and appear displaced. An eclipse where the moon blocks the sunlight enough for stars to be seen near the sun was the perfect opportunity to test this.

The scientists’ measurements during the eclipse showed that astoundingly Einstein’s predictions were indeed correct. The locations of the now visible stars appeared displaced due to the fact that their light had to travel to us on the curved space around the sun caused by its gravity as described by Einstein.

From anonymity to stardom via a solar eclipse

Later that year – on November 6 1919 in London – England’s Astronomer Royal Frank Dyson who had organized the expedition presented the results at a joint meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society and the Royal Society. Dyson said “there can be no doubt” that measurements made during the May 29 1919 solar eclipse “confirm Einstein’s prediction.”

As part of the celebration of the 100th anniversary of this legendary solar eclipse Caltech physicist Sean Carroll explained to NBCNews in 2019:

General relativity was the poster child for being a crazy new hard-to-understand theory with dramatic implications for the nature of reality. And yet you could see [the results]; you could photograph it. So people got caught up in that excitement.

And so Albert Einstein was catapulted to rock star fame a status in popular culture he has retained ever since.

A new perspective on gravity and the universe

Einstein’s general theory of relativity underlies our most basic modern cosmology our way of looking at the universe as a whole. Before Einstein scientists relied on Isaac Newton’s theory of gravity. Newton’s way of looking at gravity is still valid and is still taught to physics students. But while Newton’s formulation of gravity is more of a special case under specific conditions Einstein’s theory is a refinement of scientists’ understanding of gravity that covers the big picture … and what a mind-blowing big picture! Einstein proposed that mass causes space to curve. So for example although there appears to be a “force” (as described by Newton) that causes our Earth to be pulled towards the sun by gravity that force can “simply” be described as Earth traveling in curved space around the sun according to Einstein.

Einstein’s general theory of relativity not only explains the motion of Earth and the other planets in our solar system. In our modern cosmology it also describes extreme examples of curved space such as around black holes. And it helps to describe the history and expansion of the universe as a whole.

The solar eclipse was the first proof of many

In the century and a bit since the 1919 total solar eclipse Einstein’s relativity theory has been proven again and again in many different ways. You might have seen the recent first-ever photo of a black hole?. It also proved once again that Einstein was right.

Now and then

The Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) described modern-day practical applications of Einstein’s theory:

The theory fundamentally changed our understanding of physics and astronomy and underpins critical modern technologies such as the satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS). The theory of relativity is essential for the correct operation of GPS systems which in turn are relied on in many common applications including vehicle satellite navigation (SatNav) systems weather forecasting and disaster relief and emergency services. However the world had to wait decades before the applications of such a blue skies result could be realized.

Back in the day of the 1919 eclipse Sir Arthur Eddington attended a dinner of the same organization – RAS – shortly after the successful expedition. He then showed his humorous side by reciting a verse he had written on the feat:

Oh leave the wise our measures to collate

One thing at least is certain light has weight

One thing is certain and the rest debate

Light rays when near the sun do not go straight.

Bottom line: The solar eclipse of May 29 1919 was the day astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington verified Einstein’s general theory of relativity by observing how stars near the sun were displaced from their normal positions. This apparent change in position happens because according to Einstein’s theory the path of light is bent by gravity when it travels close to a massive object like our sun.

Recently launched in Thailand this solar electric catamaran is the next generation of the Silent 64 the brand's first solar-powered yacht. While the exterior highlights a new hull shape with a long waterline and a reverse bow its signature features such as the long window stripes on the sidewall of the hull and a wider window surface were retained.It's an 18-meter-long (59 ft) catamaran powered by two 50electric motors in cruise mode. For additional power it can switch between another two options: e-power and e-power+. The most powerful propulsion mode combines 340 kW motors with a 286 kW lithium battery bank being able to reach from the 6-8 knots cruising speed to a top 20 knots maximum speed.Designed with 42 solar panels it's even greener than its older sibling being able to ensure a 17 kWp solar power regeneration. Perhaps its most outstanding feature is the kite wing that according to Silent does not require a big mast as conventional yachts do.When not used the entire kite system can be stored in a dedicated compartment under the front deck. Plus this fully automatic kite produces up to ten times the power per square meter of a conventional sail. That's enough juice for a transoceanic range.In addition to the kite-sail system the Silent 60 sports an optional hydraulic platform that allows the possibility to upgrade the tender from 3.8 m to 4.2 m in length (12.46 to 13.77 ft). The yacht is equipped with a storage unit under the bridge deck that can accommodate a tender or a small sailboat and several kayaks. In terms of interior distribution the yacht has a flexible layout as it can be equipped with up to five cabins which include the main saloon and four guest cabins.According to Robb Report  this is the first unit of the eight Silent 60 hulls currently under construction. To date the company has already received 17 orders for the solar-powered catamaran.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluY2VwdGl2ZW1pbmQuY29tL3NvbGFyLXBvd2VyZWQtY2F0YW1hcmFuLXByZXBhcmVzLWZpcnN0LWV2ZXItc29sby10cmFuc3BhY2lmaWMtY3Jvc3NpbmcvMTkyNTkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solar-powered catamaran prepares for the first-ever solo transpacific crossing,"The 100% solar-powered catamaran will be tested in a 9000 nautical mile expedition from Chile to Australia that is set to start in December 2021.

Designed by English racer and engineer Phil Morrison the catamaran NOVA is 11 meters long 7 meters wide and able to reach speeds of 5-7 knots. Its hull is made of carbon-fiber composites and it has a displacement of 2.2 tons. The catamaran is equipped with an 11 kW PV system built with heterojunction modules provided by Russian manufacturer Hevel Solar.

The solar array will cover an area of 66 m2 (square meter) on the vessel and the sides of the hull will also carry panels providing an additional 12 m2 per side. “Whilst these panels are not expected to be as efficient as the deck panels it is hoped they will gather valuable additional energy when the sun is low on the horizon and from light reflected off the water surface” Hevel Solar says.

Solar power is used to keep the vessel going and guarantee the supply of freshwater as the boat is equipped with a desalination system powered by solar-generated electricity.

The boat will be helmed by Russian adventurer and survivalist Fedor Konyukhov in a first-ever solo transpacific crossing by solar electric catamaran. The serial adventurer will spend about 100 days alone in the ocean covering about 3000 nautical miles a month. During the voyage Konuykhov will keep a video blog and monitor the plastic pollution of the Pacific Ocean. The collected data will be further analyzed by the Russian Academy of Sciences.

“It can stay autonomous in the ocean for up to 6 months and go as far as needed without any limitations” said Oscar Konuykhov the team leader of the expedition project. “State-of-the-art technologies allow it to monitor the environment and take water samples automatically. Built with proven technologies NOVA can run in dangerous environmental conditions even in disaster areas.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB2LXRlY2gub3JnL2luZHVzdHJ5LXVwZGF0ZXMvbWF4d2VsbC10ZWNobm9sb2dpZXMtYWNoaWV2ZXMtbWFzcy1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLXJlY29yZC1mb3ItaGp0LXNvbGFyLWNlbGwtZWZmaWNpZW5jeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maxwell Technologies achieves mass production record for HJT solar cell efficiency,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yOS9lZC1iZWdsZXktanItd2Fsa3MtdXMtdGhyb3VnaC1oaXMtZWxlY3RyaWMtdmVoaWNsZXMtd2l0aC15b3UtMTk3MC1vbndhcmQv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly9jbGVhbnRlY2huaWNhLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzI5L2VkLWJlZ2xleS1qci13YWxrcy11cy10aHJvdWdoLWhpcy1lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlcy13aXRoLXlvdS0xOTcwLW9ud2FyZC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ed Begley Jr. Walks Us Through His Electric Vehicles — 1970 Onward,"Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News

When you purchase your first electric vehicle from a guy named Dutch in Reseda it’s safe to say you can officially be called an EV pioneer.

Ed Begley Jr. acclaimed actor and staunch environmentalist acquired the car from a phone book search in 1970. It was a Taylor-Dunn and he describes as more of a golf cart with a windshield wiper and a horn. Over the next several years he worked with others to have EVs converted from gas cars one a bit better than the next. Eventually he leased and owned some of the early EVs commercially available like the GM EV1 and Toyota RAV4 EV.

I recently had the pleasure of speaking with Ed for my podcast “Stu’s EV Universe.” He talks about how he’s seen some of the low points in the battle for adopting cleaner modes of fuel and transportation yet has remained extremely optimistic.

You can listen to the podcast on Apple Podcasts/iTunes Google Podcasts Spotify Anchor Breaker or elsewhere.

Ed was motivated early on by the terrible pollution in the Los Angeles area in the ‘50s and ‘60s. “Forget about running and playing in the ‘50s and ‘60s” he said. “You just sit on a bench sit still and read a book your lungs hurt you.”

When he was part of the first Earth Day in 1970 he realized that cleaning up the air and water needed to be a year-round effort.

Ed plants seeds. While he now enjoys his LEED Platinum–certified house and notes that his Tesla Model S is the best car he’s ever owned he didn’t start out that way. He is a realist and tells everyone that you need to first start with the low-hanging fruit. Things like energy efficient lighting and insulation are key.

Ed believes that everyone can learn grow and change their habits to benefit the Earth. He finds inspiration in folks like climate activist Greta Thunberg and her message that immediate action on a grand scale is needed to address climate change — that we all need to be part of the solution.

He says a lot more on my podcast especially about the future of electric transportation. Will legacy auto gain a foothold? Will EV startups take the lead? How does his family factor prominently into his environmentalism? He also discusses the importance of less consumption and much more. It’s a compelling conversation with my eco-hero.

The Milwaukee Bucks face the Miami Heat in game four of their first-round playoff series.

The Bucks have a chance to sweep the Heat and move into the next round. Furthermore this series is also a chance to get a measure of revenge over the Heat for the humiliation the Heat dealt them last year.

Giannis Antetokounmpo has looked fantastic for the Bucks while his other teammates like Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton have stepped up.

For the Miami Heat they are in a dire situation right now. The Heat haven’t been swept in a first-round series since 2007.

Jimmy Buttler has struggled against the Bucks and their stifling defense. However he did show signs of life in game three.

For the Miami Heat to be able to win against the Bucks it can’t just be Butler stepping up. Several other stars like Tyler Herro Duncan Robinson and Bam Adebayo have to step in and make a difference.

With that in mind let us take a look at the Bucks facing off against the Heat.

The Milwaukee Bucks have clearly been the superior team in this series. Barring game one the Heat haven’t come close to being a threat to the Bucks.

Jimmy Butler has not been anything close to the player he was during last year’s playoffs. But it is the Bucks’ depth that gives them the benefit over the Heat. If Milwaukee come in with anything close to the form they’ve shown recently they will be able to get the win again.

The Milwaukee Bucks face off against the Miami Heat in their first round matchup in the 2021 playoffs. This matchup was arguably one of the most anticipated in the Eastern Conference as the Heat had demolished the Bucks in the Bubble last year.

With only some changes to their respective rosters this matchup seemed like it would go down to the wire. But the Bucks have come all guns blazing at the Heat. Despite shooting poorly from the perimeter the Bucks edged past the Heat in their first game courtesy of a Khris Middleton game winner.

By way of learning-by-doing we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC).

Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.

Check out our latest analysis for FMC

How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?

ROE can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So based on the above formula the ROE for FMC is:

18% = US$557m ÷ US$3.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2021).

The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity the company generated $0.18 in profit.

Does FMC Have A Good Return On Equity?

Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below FMC has a better ROE than the average (12%) in the Chemicals industry.

That's clearly a positive. With that said a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for FMC visit our risks dashboard for free.

The Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity

Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares retained earnings or debt. In the case of the first and second options the ROE will reflect this use of cash for growth. In the latter case the debt used for growth will improve returns but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.

FMC's Debt And Its 18% ROE

FMC does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.19. There's no doubt its ROE is decent but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily because credit markets do change over time.

Conclusion

Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books the highest quality companies have high return on equity despite low debt. All else being equal a higher ROE is better.

Having said that while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock are a particularly important to consider.

He’s very kindly offered to share some of his memories of owning one of the cars used in the 1969 feature film Doppelgänger (more commonly known as Journey to the Far Side of the Sun) and the TV series UFO.

As I am sure you know the cars were designed by special effects man Derek Meddings and Ford Motor Company stylist Len Bailey. The Byfleet based racing manufacturer Alan Mann Racing was commissioned to build the two cars. (They also built Chitty Chitty Bang Bang but that’s another story). They cost £10000 each which was a lot of money in 1968. They were built out of hand-beaten alloy and measured 17 feet long 6 feet wide and 44 inches high. They were based on Ford Mk 4 car chassis.

I have always been a great fan of Gerry Anderson right from the start of the Supermarionation days of Supercar through to the first season of Space:1999. (He was certainly the reason why I got involved in film making). So it followed when I saw an article in the Daily Express newspaper back in 1968 entitled ‘Presenting the £10000 Doppelganger a car you just can’t buy!’ I was hooked. The photo shows one of the cars with Graham Hill and star Loni von Friedl.

I know there were definitely two cars built for the film; yet in one scene there appears to be three. I understand the third was probably a mock-up for filming purposes.

Later both cars like most of the actors from the film turned up in the live action series UFO. Both cars were physically changed slightly; one painted gold (Ed Straker’s car) and the other lilac (Paul Foster’s car). After filming stopped the cars were bought by a certain Ian Linscott who lived in Hatfield. He had a franchise with ITV giving him options to purchase any props coming up for sale. (Incidentally he also owned the full size FAB 1). In 1975 Radio 1 D.J.Dave Lee Travis bought Straker’s car.

Foster’s car the lilac one ended up being bought by a film company called Oppidan and was re-furbished at a reputed £8000 to appear in a sex film entitled Fluff. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately) the money for the film ran out and it was never made. However the re-furbishment was completed before the money ran out. It remained un-used in the hands of said film company for a few year until December 1979 when…I bought it!

It was only by chance that I had seen an article and a photo about the film and the car in Screen International the film and TV trade magazine. I contacted the production company and made them an offer. I think they were only too happy to sell it!

When the car arrived from London on the back of a low-loader to my home in Blackpool it was in a very sorry state. It had been painted brown was water logged and had no intention of starting. I spent 12 months (and a lot of money!!) getting it back into a presentable condition. Luckily it wasn’t in as bad a condition as first thought and I think that must be down to the fact that it was extremely well built. The shape of the car was fine except it was missing the original bonnet which was replaced by a hideous air scoop. Also missing were the side bulges which would have made the doors even heavier to lift. Still it looked pretty good.

In the film and the TV series the huge gull-wing doors were operated by an off-screen technician but since then electrically operated pneumatic rams had been fitted which enabled the doors to open and close at the touch of a button. Pretty cool! In the film and series the cars only had perspex windscreens which meant they could not be legally driven on the roads (except when filming). Fortunately the film company had gone to the trouble of having a laminated safety glass windscreen specially made and fitted so the car was the only one to actually be street legal. I had to insure the car through Lloyds of London.

I had the car sprayed red (not sure why I did that but anything was better than brown) and ran it for a couple of years. You can imagine the looks I got when driving down the road or filling up at a petrol station. It was amazing how many people recognised it from the series. Taking it for its MOT test was always a nightmare….!

Driving the car was a challenging experience to say the least. How on earth Michael Billington (Colonel Foster) or anyone else for that matter was able to actually drive the car when it was in UFO is beyond me. First of all the pedals were too far away to reach even for someone 6ft tall. Secondly the gear lever was buried inside the large central tunnel which divided the driver and passenger seats. I had these all altered so it became easier to drive.

After running the car for a few years it was mothballed until I eventually decided that it should be given a make-over and have it painted in the original UFO colour – and get it back to how it looked originally in UFO. So work began stripping it down and buying a new engine and automatic gearbox etc.

Over the years I received many phone calls visits and letters from people requesting to see that car and of course the answer was always ‘yes’. However in 1993 I received such a letter from a really nice guy who came up from Suffolk to see the car…and there and then made me an offer to buy it. So I accepted and a few weeks later this huge army tank transporter arrived to collect and take it back to Suffolk. What a way to go! Sadly that was the last time I saw the car and I am not sure what ever happened to it next. (I owned the car from December 1979 to July 1993 – 14 years.)

Still I had great fun owning and driving ‘A Car You Just Can’t Buy’!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9nMzY1MzM4NTAvZmFzdC1hbmQtZnVyaW91cy05LW1vdmllLWNhcnMtZmVhdHVyZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,See Some of the Coolest Cars Featured in Fast 9,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.caranddriver.com/news/g36533850/fast-and-furious-9-movie-cars-featured/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9nMzY1MzM4NTAvZmFzdC1hbmQtZnVyaW91cy05LW1vdmllLWNhcnMtZmVhdHVyZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZm9yZGF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS9mb3JkLXN0b2NrLXZhbHVlLWFuYWx5c2lzLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLW1heS0yNC1tYXktMjgtMjAyMS_SAV9odHRwczovL2ZvcmRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvZm9yZC1zdG9jay12YWx1ZS1hbmFseXNpcy1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1tYXktMjQtbWF5LTI4LTIwMjEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford Stock Jumps 9 Percent During Week Of May 24th – May 28th 2021,"The value of Ford stock climbed nine percent during the May 24th 2021 – May 28th 2021 timeframe. Shares closed the week at $14.53 which represents an increase of $1.20 per share or exactly 9 percent compared to the prior week’s closing value of $11.84.

By comparison shares of Ford’s cross-town rival – General Motors Company – increased $2.59 per share or about 4.6 percent during the same timeframe.

Ford Stock Factors

The moderate increase in Ford share values during the week marks the second time this month that the stock has experienced a sharp jump as the price shot up 12 percent last week which came after a nearly flat period the week before. The value of Ford stock has been fluctuating over the past several weeks but remains higher than the $9.00 per share figure that closed out the first week of trading in 2021. The investment sector seems to be steadily warming up to The Blue Oval as major institutions such as Barclays have upgraded the rating of Ford stock due to the company’s ongoing pivot towards electrification.

One week after the official reveal of the 2022 Ford F-150 Lightning Ford followed up that groundbreaking event with Capital Markets Day 2021 where various executives outlined the Ford+ plan a long term strategy that will see FoMoCo modernize its product portfolio and operations through several initiatives. A major pillar underpinning Ford+ involves a stronger financial commitment towards electric vehicle R&D two all-new EV modular platforms and the Ford IonBoost battery lineup which is expected to show up in Ford vehicles by 2025.

Beyond phasing out development of ICE vehicles the plan will also see Ford making a major play in the commercial vehicle sector with the creation of Ford Pro a completely new company aimed at increasing Ford’s dominant market position when it comes to full-size commercial trucks and vans. Blue Oval Intelligence Ford’s latest connected vehicle platform will supplement that effort by significantly expanding the amount of connected vehicles on the road by 2030. Those latest developments were undoubtedly on the minds of investors during the week and they follow numerous actions undertaken by Ford and at the behest of CEO Jim Farley to streamline the company’s operations and to tackle pressing issues head-on.

The recent partnership between Ford and Google could potentially help boost the value of Ford stock in the future as well although the fruits of this collaboration are still in gestation. The tie-up will see both companies work together to improve Ford’s internal technological operations. Additionally most Ford and Lincoln vehicles will come equipped with a variant Google’s automotive operating system starting in 2023. The move was seemingly well received by Wall Street which drove up the value of Ford shares on the day FoMoCo publicly revealed the agreement.

There was more encouraging news about Ford’s performance in other markets earlier in the year. Ford sales increased 30 percent in China during the fourth quarter of 2020 building on the 25 percent growth experienced during the third quarter of 2020. Notably Q4 2020 represented FoMoCo’s single biggest sales increased in China since 2016.

Meanwhile CEO Jim Farley’s recent statements about affordable EVs and his goal of curbing warranty costs could also have positively influenced past share values. Additionally the new CEO recently outlined key goals and organizational changes which include:

An expansion for Ford’s leading commercial vehicle business with a suite of software services that drive loyalty and recurring revenue streams.

Offering compelling uniquely Ford fully electric vehicles at scale around the world including the Ford Transit Ford F-Series Ford Mustang SUVs and Lincoln models.

Adding more affordable vehicles to Ford’s global lineup including in North America.

Increasing the amount of money spent on EV development to $30 billion through 2025.

Having Ford Europe transition to zero-emissions vehicles by 2027 and switch completely over to full EVs by 2030.

The launch of Ford Ion Park a facility designed to facilitate R&D initiatives on battery production.

An investment in Solid Power a producer of solid-state batteries.

BlueOvalSK a joint venture between Ford and SK Innovation Ford’s preferred supplier of EV batteries.

At the beginning of 2020 investors seemed encouraged by the overwhelmingly positive reception of the all-new 2021 Ford Bronco and 2021 Ford Bronco Sport. In fact Ford stock experienced four consecutive weeks of growth following the reveal of the off-roaders. The limited-production First Edition of the Bronco two-door and four-door sold out in just a few hours prompting Ford to double availability. The Bronco Sport First Edition sold out in less than two days. All three Bronco models have seen massive interest causing significant traffic spikes on the automaker’s website as Bronco reservations exceeded 165000 in the first three weeks of availability. The Ford Bronco Sport started rolling out to dealers in late November 2020 and has steadily marched up the sales charts since that date a trend that was reinforced very recently as Ford moved 13856 examples of the Bronco Sport in April 2021.

Besides the Bronco Sport and (slightly delayed) Bronco Ford is steadily rolling the all-new 2021 F-150 – its most profitable and revenue-generating product. The all-new half-ton full-size pickup is turning very fast. The truck which faces constrained supply features a significant amount of updates and new features along with an all-new exterior and interior. An all-new third-generation F-150 Raptor joins the F-150 lineup later this year while the Ford F-150 Lighting will follow suit in spring 2022.

Prior to the reveals of the F-150 and Bronco family Ford and Volkswagen agreed upon the finer details of a new partnership wherein both automakers will develop and produce several vehicles. Additionally the tie-up will see VW invest several billion in Argo AI an autonomous software firm backed by Ford. Speaking of partnerships recent reports indicate the Ford-Rivian partnership is “going great” and that a new Ford model stemming from the tie-up is on track.

It will be interesting to see how Ford stock will perform throughout Q2 2021 especially in light of various actions taken by the Dearborn-based automaker to improve the fitness of its business. These actions include discontinuing all sedans to focus on more profitable crossovers SUVs and pickups in North America while at the same time investing in resource-intensive autonomous vehicle technologies like its Argo AI as well as electric vehicles like the Ford E-Transit and F-150 Lightning.

“The key here is not just for us the sedan segment itself has been in decline for a very long time and that decline has been accelerating over the last few years” Kumar Galhotra President of Ford North America told Ford Authority executive editor Alex Luft in a 2020 interview.

It’s worth noting that The Blue Oval started both efforts much later than its direct rivals. For instance FCA was the first to discontinue most of its sedan portfolio and General Motors started to invest heavily into EVs and autonomous vehicles earlier than The Blue Oval.

Ford’s first dedicated EV is the 2021 Mustang Mach-E – a four-door crossover-like hatch inspired by the legendary Mustang pony car. More than anything else the Mustang Mach-E demonstrates that Ford isn’t afraid to redefine legendary nameplates and recreate them in new body styles and as new vehicle types.

Production of the Mach-E kicked off in late October 2020 and the model has since found a following within its home market although sales are a bit low due to production constraints. Ford delivered its first three examples in December 2020 and 6614 units in Q1 2021. The first batch of units reached Europe during that same timeframe and more recently shipments started arriving in Scandinavia as well. Automotive outlets and industry experts praised the EV for its good looks engaging driving dynamics upscale interior and clever engineering. Additionally preliminary reports suggest that the vehicle is already eating into Tesla’s market share which would be a significant achievement especially when considering the relatively short amount of time the Mach-E has been on the market.

The 2021 Mustang Mach-E represents one part of a three-sided trident Ford hopes will increase its North American market share this year and beyond. The other products on this figurative spearhead are the 2021 Ford F-150 and the Bronco family of vehicles which includes the 2021 Ford Bronco and the 2021 Ford Bronco Sport. With three of the four vehicles currently in the initial stages of their respective rollouts it will be some time before their effects are well known. That said all models have a significant amount of potential to resonate with car shoppers and their reception will almost certainly impact the value of Ford stock in the coming months provided the company can build a steady supply of them.

During this period the owner’s manual recommends avoiding aggressive upshifts and downshifts hard braking high speed and towing.

SUV

As with every break-in period  the 2021 model year Bronco may exhibit ""unusual driving characteristics."" The Ford Motor Company didn’t elaborate but do remember that every internal combustion engine needs to be treated with care during this period. The mechanical run-in procedure boils down to the bedding of the piston rings on the hone of the cylinder walls.Achieving the correct seal against the cylinder walls translates to a powerplant with low blow-by past the rings and low oil consumption two elements that profoundly affect the long-term life of the engine. Although not specifically needed it’s best to change the filter and oil right after the break-in period to eliminate any metal particles or small shavings.According to our friends at The Bronco Nation  the 2.3- and 2.7-liter EcoBoost mills take 5W-30 synthetic blend or 0W-30 synthetic blend for winter driving. Both engine oils are marketed under Motorcraft the service parts division that Ford launched in 1972 as the successor to Autolite.Customers also have to be careful with the 7-speed manual and 10-speed automatic transmissions which take 2.4 and 13.1 quarts of transmission fluid sold by Motorcraft under part numbers WSS-M2C200-D2 and WSS-M2C949-A MERCON ULV. Motorcraft further lists the brake fluid and transfer case fluid as WSS-M6C65-A2 and WSS-M2C938-AMERCON LV.Last but certainly not least there are exactly two flavors of axle fluid. These come in the guise of 80W-90 premium rear-axle lubricant (WSP-M2C197-A) and 75W-85 premium synthetic hypoid gear lubricant (WSS-M2C942-S).In related news the Blue Oval is expected to start full production of the ladder-frameat the beginning of August. With a bit of luck the first units will be delivered to their rightful owners by the end of the summer."

""The reality is that the stuff we’ve uncovered is shocking"" Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich told FOX Business in an interview last week. ""It just confirms that Google is doing everything it can to spy on everyone it can without providing any sort of notice to anyone.""

ROKU ACCUSES GOOGLE OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE TACTICS IN YOUTUBE TV NEGOTIATIONS

Brnovich's office sued Google in May of last year alleging that the tech giant used deceptive and unfair practices to track users' location even if they had opted out -- and used that information to target users with ads that generated more than $130 billion in revenue in 2019.

The practice had initially been revealed after an Associated Press article in 2018 reported that Google could continue to track users' locations even after they had opted out of Google getting access into ""location history."" The outlet reported that even with location history paused some Google apps automatically store time-stamped data without a prompt such as storing a snapshot of a location just when someone opens its ""Maps"" application.

Google later tweaked its privacy settings but Brnovich launched the lawsuit in May 2020 – part of a broader anti-Big Tech push by Republican attorneys general and lawmakers. The state alleges that Google acted deceptively misleading consumers.

""We allege when consumers try to opt out of Google collecting location data the company is continuing to find misleading ways to obtain that information and then use it for their financial advantage"" Brnovich told FOX Business.

Google has accused Arizona of misconstruing what Google does and that the lawsuit has been encouraged by Oracle -- which has fought with Google in court over the rights to software code used in its Android software. Bloomberg News reported how Oracle has been lobbying regulators and law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and the E.U. to go after Google including over privacy concerns.

""The Attorney General and our competitors driving this lawsuit have gone out of their way to mischaracterize our services"" Google spokesperson José Castañeda told Fox News. ""We have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data. We look forward to setting the record straight.""

As part of the discovery process emails between Google engineers sent in the wake of the 2018 AP article show that they had concerns about the practice and believed the concerns raised in the article were valid. Some of those emails became public last year but others were released recently as the process continues.

""So there is no way to give a third party app your location and not Google? This doesn’t sound like something we would want on the front page of the NYT"" one employee says in a newly unredacted section first reported by The Arizona Mirror.

""I agree with the article. Location off should mean location off not except for this case or that case"" another says.

HAWLEY HITS BACK AT FACEBOOK'S DARK MONEY GROUP TARGETING HIS ANTI-TRUST PUSH

""Real people just think in terms of ‘location is on’ ‘location is off’ because that is exactly what you have on the front screen of your phone"" another says.

Brnovich says the emails indicate that Google employees knew that what it was doing would upset customers.

""What we've uncovered so far I believe shows that Google themselves understand and appreciate that what they are doing is something that is sneaky and something that would piss off consumers if they knew about it"" he said. ""So the fact they are trying to hide what they are doing they are being sneaky about it and using every trick in the arsenal to stop this from seeing the light of day is all consumers need to know about Google’s intentions.""

As for what is next in the lawsuit Brnovich tells FOX Business the state will continue to depose Google employees about the case and there is another periodic status update next month. He believes that the case will likely go to trial next year.

While there have been a number of Republican efforts to crack down on the influence of Big Tech whether it be privacy concerns or alleged censorship by companies like Twitter Brnovich denies that it is a partisan issue.

""This isn't a Republican or a Democrat issue"" he said. When we launched this investigation to protect Arizona consumers in Arizona state court it was unique and it was different and it was groundbreaking.""

He also acknowledges that fighting a massive corporation like Google is an uphill climb.

""Google has an army of lawyers and lobbyists and they have done everything they can to procedurally stop up from getting to the merits of the lawsuit and quite frankly to hide what they are doing"" he said.

Industry sources who spoke anonymously because the discussions are confidential said News Corp is also in talks with US media business Fox Corp which is also controlled by the Murdoch family to secure licensing rights to use the FOX Bet brand for the new business.

""The reality is that the stuff we’ve uncovered is shocking"" Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich told FOX Business in an interview last week. ""It just confirms that Google is doing everything it can to spy on everyone it can without providing any sort of notice to anyone.""

ROKU ACCUSES GOOGLE OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE TACTICS IN YOUTUBE TV NEGOTIATIONS

Brnovich's office sued Google in May of last year alleging that the tech giant used deceptive and unfair practices to track users' location even if they had opted out -- and used that information to target users with ads that generated more than $130 billion in revenue in 2019.

The practice had initially been revealed after an Associated Press article in 2018 reported that Google could continue to track users' locations even after they had opted out of Google getting access into ""location history."" The outlet reported that even with location history paused some Google apps automatically store time-stamped data without a prompt such as storing a snapshot of a location just when someone opens its ""Maps"" application.

Google later tweaked its privacy settings but Brnovich launched the lawsuit in May 2020 – part of a broader anti-Big Tech push by Republican attorneys general and lawmakers. The state alleges that Google acted deceptively misleading consumers.

""We allege when consumers try to opt out of Google collecting location data the company is continuing to find misleading ways to obtain that information and then use it for their financial advantage"" Brnovich told FOX Business.

Google has accused Arizona of misconstruing what Google does and that the lawsuit has been encouraged by Oracle -- which has fought with Google in court over the rights to software code used in its Android software. Bloomberg News reported how Oracle has been lobbying regulators and law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and the E.U. to go after Google including over privacy concerns.

AMAZON GOOGLE APPLE EMPLOYEES VOICE SUPPORT FOR PALESTINIANS

""The Attorney General and our competitors driving this lawsuit have gone out of their way to mischaracterize our services"" Google spokesperson José Castañeda told Fox News. ""We have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data. We look forward to setting the record straight.""

As part of the discovery process emails between Google engineers sent in the wake of the 2018 AP article show that they had concerns about the practice and believed the concerns raised in the article were valid. Some of those emails became public last year but others were released recently as the process continues.

""So there is no way to give a third party app your location and not Google? This doesn’t sound like something we would want on the front page of the NYT"" one employee says in a newly unredacted section first reported by The Arizona Mirror.

""I agree with the article. Location off should mean location off not except for this case or that case"" another says.

""Real people just think in terms of ‘location is on’ ‘location is off’ because that is exactly what you have on the front screen of your phone"" another says.

Brnovich says the emails indicate that Google employees knew that what it was doing would upset customers.

""What we've uncovered so far I believe shows that Google themselves understand and appreciate that what they are doing is something that is sneaky and something that would piss off consumers if they knew about it"" he said. ""So the fact they are trying to hide what they are doing they are being sneaky about it and using every trick in the arsenal to stop this from seeing the light of day is all consumers need to know about Google’s intentions.""

As for what is next in the lawsuit Brnovich tells FOX Business the state will continue to depose Google employees about the case and there is another periodic status update next month. He believes that the case will likely go to trial next year.

While there have been a number of Republican efforts to crack down on the influence of Big Tech whether it be privacy concerns or alleged censorship by companies like Twitter Brnovich denies that it is a partisan issue.

""This isn't a Republican or a Democrat issue"" he said. When we launched this investigation to protect Arizona consumers in Arizona state court it was unique and it was different and it was groundbreaking.""

He also acknowledges that fighting a massive corporation like Google is an uphill climb.

""Google has an army of lawyers and lobbyists and they have done everything they can to procedurally stop up from getting to the merits of the lawsuit and quite frankly to hide what they are doing"" he said.

With the growing popularity of trainers and programs like Zwift structured training and power data have become much more mainstream.

As more cyclists seek to bring the benefits of training with power outdoors power meters are also having a moment.

When it comes to measuring power pedal-based power meters are emerging as some of the most universally compatible affordable (relatively speaking) and easy to install options. Within the last few years one brand Favero has managed to outshine some bigger companies in the blossoming pedal-based power meter market.

RELATED: The basics of power in cycling and why you need a power meter

I tested the Favero’s dual-sided Assioma Duo power meter pedals and I have (almost) only good things to say about them.

Pods

The Duo pedals each have a pod on the pedal spindle which houses the power meter internals. The pods don’t affect the Q-factor which is a standard 54mm though some riders with particularly wide feet have reported having to shift their cleats over slightly to avoid hitting the pod.

The circular housing pod has little embedded LED lights that blink pleasantly when you wake it up and I personally think they look kind of futuristic. Others have told me they prefer a classic-looking pedal without the bulky addition. To each their own.

Because the electronics are housed in the pods any damaged pedal bodies can easily and affordably be replaced.

You can check the battery status of your power meter on your head unit. Charging the pedals is very simple—a long USB cord magnetically attaches to each pedal pod with a satisfying click. Favero says the batteries have about 50 hours of life which tracked pretty accurately by my calculations. After around 40 hours of riding I charged them when I got a low battery signal. Favero says the notification is sent eight hours before the battery is completely drained.

Installation

The pedals install like any standard pedal. They’re packaged with an 8mm Allen key a nice bonus if you don’t have a pedal wrench at home. The Assioma Duos communicate via Bluetooth and ANT+ with bike computers and smartphones and you’ll need to download the Assioma app to input your crank length and to find any firmware updates. Installation and setup went smoothly and took me about 10 minutes total.

Cleats

The number one (and pretty much only) issue I had with these pedals was the cleats. The Assiomas only use Look-style cleats so I had to switch over from SPD-SLs—not the end of the world but it did mean a few rides of micro-adjustments to get the fit just right. Someone with a very specific fit looking to make the same switch should consider bringing the cleats to a professional bike fitter.

RELATED: Why you should get a bike fit before you shop for a new ride

Beyond being not-SPD-SL (I’m being a bit picky here) the cleats that came with the pedals were also much more slippery than I expected. The first time I unclipped I put my foot on the ground and it promptly slid across the road to the sidewalk embarrassingly half-knocking me off my bike at a busy intersection. After that incident I switched over to branded Look Keo cleats which had a much better grip.

Readings

The most important measure of a good power meter is whether it reads power accurately consistently and reliably over time. Testing the pedals I didn’t experience any dropouts my power numbers didn’t erratically fluctuate and the pedals’ power readings were consistent and in line with a Tacx Neo 2T trainer when comparing power output data. Favro says the Assiomas are accurate to +/- 1 per cent. I didn’t encounter anything that made me question that figure during my testing.

Favero Assioma or Garmin Rally?

There is a natural comparison to be made between the Assioma and recently released Garmin Rally power meter pedals. The 305g Assioma Duos are about $840 while the Rally RS200s are 320g and $1430. Garmin’s power meter pedals have a much longer battery life (up to 120 hours) but they use disposable batteries.

RELATED: Review: Garmin Rally RS200 power meter pedals

Both pedals have similar Cycling Dynamics features which are fun to look at but ultimately won’t have massive training implications for most users. The Rally RS has a 12.2 mm stack height and Favero’s Assioma pedal has a claimed stack height of 10.5 mm. It sounds small but I did feel as though I noticed the difference switching from the Assiomas to the Rallys and back again.

So which should you go with? If you’re picky about using your SPD-SL cleats or want to switch between road and off-road pedals go with the Garmin Rally. If you don’t mind Look-style cleats and are looking to spend less the Assiomas are probably the way to go.

Duo or Uno?

The Favero Assioma Uno which measures power only from one pedal is significantly cheaper (about $540) than the double-sided Duo. The $300 difference in cost between the single-sided power meter and dual-sided is significant but for some the cost is worth it. The decision mostly comes down to how concerned you are with the accuracy of your data. Because the Uno is only reading power data from one leg it doubles the number to give you your power output which assumes you’re putting out the same power from both legs.

Nobody’s legs are completely even so with a single-sided power meter you’ll always have a higher margin of error in your power numbers—the non-measured leg will either be very slightly stronger or very slightly weaker (and that margin of difference can vary even throughout a ride).

That being said for those who are looking to simply get consistent readings that they can use to train outdoors and track progress over time the Uno is a viable option. Favero also offers an Uno upgrade kit (about $520) for Uno owners looking to level-up to Dual-sided power.

Assioma overall

In February someone leaked a photo of what appeared to be new Assioma SPD-SL compatible spindles on the Trainer Road forum. If the rumours are true and Favero is actually working on an SPD-SL pedal I would feel comfortable recommending them to pretty much every cyclist I know. Picky cleat hangups aside I would already recommend the Assioma Duos to most cyclists looking for a power meter—they’re a reliable product that does exactly what it’s designed to do: measure power accurately.

“After my abandon at the Giro I was off the bike for a few days but I have resumed training now and everything seems to be going in the right direction” said Ewan in a team statement.

The 26-year-old was never considered likely to ride all the way to Milan given he was also fronting up to the Tour de France potentially even for a tilt at the green jersey but his abandon midway through stage 8 was earlier than expected. It was a move that drew criticism though the rider said he was more disappointed than anyone that he had to leave and clarified that the reason for his withdrawal was knee pain.

“I just hope I didn’t lose too much of my shape because I really needed more race rhythm” said Ewan. “That is why I was so disappointed to pull out of the Giro with the ‘maglia ciclamino’ on my shoulders. The plan was to continue for at least another week and trying to reward the team with a third-stage victory.”

Now with his knee recovering and the team expecting him to be able to line up at the Tour de France as planned the rider – who has taken 11 Grand Tour stage wins over his career so far – will be looking to find that race rhythm in Belgium instead.

“The Baloise Belgium Tour is definitely a good race as a preparation towards the Tour” said Lotto Soudal’s general manager John Lelangue. “In 2019 Caleb prepared for the Tour de France via a similar run-up with the ZLM Tour now being the Baloise Belgium Tour.”

Lelangue said he and Ewan were both optimistic about the next step in his plan to win a stage at every Grand Tour this year with the Tour de France starting on June 26 in Brest delivering a number of opportunities for the sprinters.

This blanket statement fails to capture the nuances of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). If you take a shower after work you’re probably going to be just fine. The two industries with the least amount of digitization right now are construction and agriculture. Ironically both industries can’t find competent labor unless they import it from south of the border.

If you take a shower before work you may be in for a world of hurt. Ideally you’re the person in the office who automates themselves out of a job so you can climb to the next rung. Robotics process automation (RPA) is what white-collar workers should embrace not fear. It’s what will allow them to “move on to more value-added activities.” That or you’ll just get canned but in either case you can probably hedge any future misfortune by investing in RPA stocks. The first thing we need to do is come up with a list of all publicly traded robotic process automation stocks.

A List of RPA Companies

In order to come up with a universe of RPA companies we should be watching we can turn to those people whose entire job is to figure out which leaders are emerging.

upGrad which offers more than 100 courses in collaboration with top-notch global/local universities like Deakin Business School (Australia) Duke CE (US) Michigan State University (US) Liverpool Business School (UK) IIT Madras (India) IIM Kozhikode (India) and others has empowered over 10 lakh registered learners over 50 countries across the world.

“Beyond working professionals and lifelong learners we are witnessing a great response across age groups in India from all corners of the country. The proportion of small-town India has increased significantly on our chart because pandemic has sent thousands of people home and they are joining online classes from their hometowns” Mayank Kumar Co-Founder and MD upGrad told IANS.

According to Kumar the pandemic has brought in a tectonic shit in online education and higher education is witnessing a tremendous surge across the globe.

Co-founded by entrepreneur Ronnie Screwvala Kumar and Phalgun Kompalli in 2015 upGrad has achieved an annual revenue run rate (ARR) of $165 million and maintains a strong network of over 20 national and international universities.

What sets it apart from other online players is ‘deep personalisation’ where counsellors virtually handhold each learner for the entire duration of course.

Each student over a year goes through more than 50 one-on-one coaching sessions from their future hiring managers/business leaders and get personalised job recommendations based on their experience aptitude and personal ambition.

As a result the course completion rate is 80 per cent which is unprecedented in online education worldwide according to the company.

“We are seeking collaborations with more Indian higher education institutes to widen our reach and benefit more and more learners in the country” said Kumar an IIT-Delhi alumnus who has over 10 years of experience in education as an investor and an advisor.

Earlier this week upGrad announced to acquire video-enabled learning solutions provider Impartus committing over Rs 150 crore towards the buyout as well as to boost its growth and cement its foothold in college education.

Impartus now a 100 per cent subsidiary of upGrad has been rebranded as ‘upGrad Campus’.

‘upGrad Campus’ will have two business verticals. While under B2C vertical it will offer several job-oriented courses under the B2B vertical these offerings will be to HigherEd Institutions (HEI).

The move will enable upGrad to add 50000 paid learners in the very first year of the acquisition according to Kumar.

In the pandemic-hit 2020 more than 450 companies including ZS Associates PayTM Gartner Flipkart (Walmart-acquired) Accenture and E&Y hired more than 1200 learners from the upGrad talent pool.

In 2021 till March jointly with the recruitment and staffing solutions firm Rekrut India which is now a 100 per cent subsidiary of upGrad the company has enabled over 2500 career transitions with a highest salary hike of 400 per cent (a package of Rs 73 lakh per annum).

“We don’t offer short-term one-month-odd courses. We offer extensive courses and extend solid knowledge that takes time and a lot of hours. We believe that the knowledge that we offer our users can use it to his/her advantage in real life” Kumar said.",,,

I love reading music from a creamy well-printed Bärenreiter edition any day but I have to say that reading from a computer tablet has gained in appeal for me in recent years.

For example rather than procuring 24 pages or more of paper-copy practice parts for an orchestra concert or church gig I can simply download the music to my computer tablet. When the gig is over there's no guilty feeling over throwing an entire tree's worth of paper into the wastebasket - with one simple keyboard action the music is gone. And with quartets we can agree which one to play and if I want to practice it I can download the part of IMSLP if I don't have it in my library.

That said I am still working on the set-up for my computer tablet. I inherited an iPad Pro (2nd gen 12.9"") from my late father-in-law and while I've figured out how to load music into ForScore I've recently realized that I really want an Apple Pen so that I can write more easily in the scores -- and I can't get a cheap knockoff for such an old tablet! And if I'm really serious I want a pedal page-turner. The page-turner is really almost a necessity for rehearsing or performing since the tablet shows only one page at a time.

The point is I'm seriously considering investing in these things largely because it is so much easier to deal with gig music and quartet music on a computer tablet.

Of course I still do have an entire library of physical sheet music and I use it every day. I feel it's important to have well-published physical copies of certain music - etude books concerti the Sonatas and Partitas and even important orchestra parts like violin parts for the Brahms Symphonies etc. I encourage students to get physical copies of their music as much as possible.

How do you like to read your sheet music? Are you most happy with physical paper copies of music? Or do you find that you more often use a computer tablet? For the vote I'm not giving the option of ""both"" even though I know many people (myself included) probably use both. I'd like for you to make an argument for one or the other - which are you preferring at the moment? Have you never used a computer tablet? After all they are expensive and they require a learning curve. Did the pandemic expand your use of the tablet? Do your eyes prefer paper?

Please participate in the vote and then tell us your thoughts and experiences with traditional paper editions of music vs. computer tablets for music reading.

Why trust us?

HP Envy 14 (2021) review: Great laptop but tread lightly MSRP $1250.00 Score Details “The HP Envy 14 lacks a brilliant display but makes up for it with impressive performance.” Pros Excellent productivity performance

Solid build quality

Conservative good looks

Good entry-level gaming

Superior keyboard and touchpad Cons Display is subpar for the intended creative market

A little thick and heavy for the class

Media battery life is underwhelming

HP’s Envy laptops have morphed from midrange offerings into what the company intends as the most attractive machines for creative types. The Envy 15 for example is a powerful laptop with a color-accurate OLED display that competes well against other 15-inch laptops in terms of performance and particularly price. Now HP has reintroduced its HP Envy 14 form factor with a new machine that leverages Intel’s 11th-gen Tiger Lake CPUs and discrete Nvidia graphics — all in a chassis that’s a bit smaller than its larger sibling.

I reviewed an $1150 Envy 14 configuration with the Core i5-1135G7 CPU 16GB of RAM a 256GB solid-state drive (SSD) a 14-inch WUXGA (1920 x 1200) IPS display in a more productivity-friendly 16:10 aspect ratio and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Max-Q GPU.

That’s a premium price for the configuration proving that the Envy 14 is intended to compete with the very best laptops you can buy. But does it offer the performance and display quality that creative users crave?

Design

The Envy 14 is constructed of stamped aluminum which is one difference from the CNC-machined Spectre line. The latter is a bit more robust in its build quality with the Envy 14 demonstrating just a touch of bending in the lid and flexing in the keyboard deck. It’s a solid build just not up there with the likes of the HP Spectre x360 14 or other premium laptops like the Dell XPS 13.

The MSI Prestige 14 Evo is another 14-inch clamshell laptop that feels about the same as the Envy 14 — solid but not quite top-notch. Note that the Prestige 14 Evo is also a couple of hundred dollars less than the HP with a Core i7 and 1TB SSD. Finally I’ll mention the Porsche Design Acer Book RS which mixes carbon fiber and metal for a more solid feel.

Aesthetically HP was going for a minimalist design with the Envy 14 and it succeeded. Unlike the gem-cut and multicolored Spectre x360 14 the Envy 14 is a matte silver color with an uncluttered appearance and simple lines. It’s attractive enough but doesn’t stand out. The MSI Prestige 14 Evo is also more aggressive in its styling and coloring but I find the Envy 14 strikes a nice balance.

It’s a lot like Lenovo’s Yoga 9i in this respect — a design that’s not meant to draw attention to itself but won’t embarrass you no matter the environment. If you want a 14-inch clamshell to show off the Porsche Design Acer Book RS has by far the most aggressive styling.

The Envy 14 is a bit stouter than much of its 14-inch competition. Its chassis is reasonably sized thanks to an 88% screen-to-body ratio and small bezels all around except for the chin which is only slightly larger than the current trend. But it’s a bit thicker at 0.71 inches and heavier at 3.3 pounds. The Prestige 14 Evo for example is 0.63 inches thick and weighs 2.85 pounds while the Acer Swift 5 is 0.59 inches and 2.31 pounds.

Those laptops don’t have the option for discrete graphics however and can give up internal space for keeping things cool. The Envy 14 also looks a bit thicker thanks to a rear leg that props up the keyboard and adds additional space underneath for better airflow.

Connectivity is a real strength with a USB-A 3.1 port full-size HDMI 2.0 port USB4 Type-C port with Thunderbolt 4 support and a 3.5mm audio jack along the left-hand side and another USB-A 3.1 port and a microSD card reader on the right-hand side. Wireless connectivity is handled by Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1.

Performance

Unlike the larger Envy 15 that sports a 45-watt Intel CPU the Envy 14 features an Intel 11th-generation Tiger Lack Core i5-1135G7 processor. We’ve found that to be a quick option in the U-series nearly as fast in many cases as Intel’s Core i7 that’s clocked just a bit faster.

The Envy 14 lives up to the CPU’s promise. As you can see in the table below it doesn’t excel in Geekbench 5 but it’s more competitive in our other tests. HP offers its Command Center software that lets you tune the CPU for fan noise and heat versus full-on performance but it doesn’t make as much of a difference in the Envy 14 as it does in the Envy 15 and Spectre x360 14 as two examples. The Spectre x360 14 in particular makes good use of the utility — it’s quite fast in Performance mode while very quiet and much slower in Balanced mode. All of the Envy 14 results listed here are with the utility set at Balanced.

Across the board the Envy 14 performs admirably even against the Core i7 competition. In our Handbrake test that encodes a 420MB file to H.265 the Envy 14 was in line with all but the Prestige 14 Evo and the Ryzen 7 5800U-based Asus ZenBook 13 that blew away its Intel competition. In performance mode the Envy 14 was in third place among this group.

In Cinebench R23 the results were similar with the Prestige 14 Evo and the Zenbook 13 leading the pack. Note that the Envy 14 scored an even more competitive 6073 in the Cinebench multi-core test in performance mode. In the PCMark 10 Complete test the Envy 14 came in second place in the overall score. It also did well in the Productivity and Content Creation portions of the test while falling behind in the Essentials portion.

Overall the Envy 14 was a solid performer in our benchmarks and it felt that way while I was using it during the review. It’s a speedy machine for all the productivity tasks you’ll want to throw at it and it does as well in creative applications as any other Tiger Lake laptop. It can’t keep up with AMD’s Ryzen CPUs in processor-intensive tasks but that’s where the discrete GPU comes into play.

If you’re using an application that can take advantage of the GPU then the GTX 1650 Ti Max-Q — a rarity in the 14-inch class — makes a real difference. HP configured the GPU with Nvidia’s Studio platform drivers which provide better performance and reliability in certain popular creative applications.

For example I ran the PugetBench benchmark that runs through a series of intensive tasks in Premiere Pro — an application that makes efficient use of a GPU. The Envy 14 did quite well for a U-series machine scoring 432 to embarrass the ZenBook 13’s 180 and the MacBook Air M1’s 320. It couldn’t keep up with laptops powered by Intel’s 45-watt CPUs and faster GPUs but it did well based on its components. In fact it beat out the HP Spectre x360 15 that scored 339 with its Core i7-10750H and GTX 1650 Ti.

The Envy 14 is also a decent entry-level gaming laptop for anyone who wants a little break from work. It led the pack in the 3DMark Time Spy test doubling up the Intel Iris Xe-based competition. It also performed decently in Fortnite hitting 49 frames per second (fps) at 1080p and high graphics (57 fps in Performance mode) where the rest of the Tiger Lake class runs around 30 fps.

With epic graphics enabled the Envy 14 hit 39 fps (40 fps in Performance mode) still quite playable and much faster than the Tiger Lake average of around 22 fps. You won’t run modern titles with graphical details turned up but tune things down a little and most titles will be playable.

Display

Creative professionals want displays with wide color gamuts and accurate colors to go along with a high brightness level and excellent contrast. Does the Envy 14’s productivity-friendly 16:10 display stack up as well as its design and performance?

In a word no. It’s a bright display at 371 nits well above our 300-nit threshold. But it covers just 70% of AdobeRGB and 94% of sRGB slightly below average for premium and near-premium laptops and well below average for displays intended for creative types. None of the 14-inch laptops I’ve discussed in this review are much better — the MSI Prestige 14 Evo and Porsche Design Acer Base RS both came in at 73% of AdobeRGB and 97% of sRGB for example so just slightly higher.

The Envy 14’s color accuracy was good at 1.28 (1.0 or less is considered excellent). The Prestige 14 Evo hit 1.3 and the Porsche Design Acer Base RS was at 1.15. These better than average results and closer to the professional level.

The contrast was another weak spot for the Envy 14 which achieved a ratio of just 880:1. We like to see premium displays at 1000:1 or higher which the MSI and the Acer both nearly achieved at 970:1 and 940:1 respectively.

In truth the Envy 14’s display would be barely acceptable as a premium productivity display. It certainly doesn’t live up to the standards desired by creators unlike the OLED display on the Envy 15 that managed 97% of Adobe RGB 100% of sRGB a 404410:1 contrast ratio (to be fair that’s typical for OLED displays and no IPS panel will ever come close) and a DeltaE of 0.73.

If the Envy 14 has a weakness regarding its target market this display would be it. And it’s an important one — anybody wanting to buy this laptop for photo or video editing should keep these results in mind.

Keyboard and touchpad

The Envy 14 inherited a similar keyboard to the one found in HP’s Spectre line — and that’s a good thing. There’s plenty of spacing between the square keys and the switches are light and precise with a comfortable bottoming action. The lettering is attractive and legible in good lighting and the two-level backlighting is effective and consistent. This is one of the better keyboards around rivaling Dell’s XPS 13 and only slightly falling behind Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard on its MacBook line.

The touchpad is also excellent benefitting from the larger keyboard deck thanks to the taller 16:10 display. The touchpad is a Microsoft Precision version of course and so it’s responsive and precise. The buttons click solidly but without too much noise which is a plus. There’s also an equally responsive touch display and I appreciated it during my testing.

A fingerprint reader provides windows 10 Hello support on the keyboard and replaces the right control button. I’m not a fan of that placement having run into at least one application with a hard-coded use for the right control button but the fingerprint reader was accurate and fast in my testing.

Additional security and privacy are provided by a function key that controls a physical shutter for the webcam and a dedicated button to turn off the microphone. These are small touches that are appreciated for those times when you don’t want your webcam showing off your messy office — or worse being hacked and used to spy on you.

Battery life

The Envy 14 packs a 63 watt-hour battery which frankly is smaller than I expected. The Spectre x360 14 a much smaller laptop managed to fit in 67 watt-hours. Even so I was expecting better longevity out of the Envy 14 thanks to its lower-resolution 1920 x 1200 IPS display compared to the Spectre’s 3000 x 2000 OLED panel.

As it turns out my expectations were met. The Envy 14 achieved just over 12.5 hours on our web browsing test that loops through a series of popular websites. That’s a strong score that beats out all the 14-inch competition I’ve mentioned by several hours and is in the upper echelon of all the laptops we’ve tested.

The Envy 14 wasn’t quite as strong in our video test that plays a Full HD Avengers trailer until the battery runs out. Here the HP managed 14.5 hours a good score but one that’s beat out by the MSI Prestige 14 Evo and the Porsche Design Acer Base RS. Usually we see a larger difference between the web and video tests with the latter typically being quite a bit longer.

Finally I ran the PCMark 10 Gaming battery test that stresses the CPU and GPU and the Envy 14 manages just under 1.5 hours. That’s at the low end of all the machines we’ve tested demonstrating that the Envy 14 is a real battery hog when it’s under load. Unfortunately the Envy 14 couldn’t complete the PCMark 10 Applications battery test which is the best indication of real-world productivity.

Overall I’d rate the Envy 14’s battery life as good for productivity work and not as good for media consumption. And certainly if you’re going to be pushing the CPU and GPU then you’ll want to carry your charger with you.

Our take

The Envy 14 is a well-built good-looking 14-inch laptop with a fast Core i5 and a discrete GPU that’s unusual for a nongaming laptop of this size. That makes it a strong performer and in that sense a good option for the creative types that HP is aiming to please. Unfortunately its display is a bit subpar — it’s good enough for productivity users but not so much for creativity.

That makes the Envy 14 an interesting laptop to rate. It’s a solid offering for general users with good performance and productivity battery life a solid build and an excellent keyboard and touchpad. It may not meet the needs of the creative types that HP is aiming at but it’s a very good laptop for everyone else.

Are there any alternatives?

The MSI Prestige 14 Evo is a solid alternative to the Envy 14. It’s faster at CPU-intensive tasks has a better display and good battery life. It’s also quite a bit less expensive but of course you don’t get the fast GPU.

If a 2-in-1 is more your style then you’ll want to consider the HP Spectre x360 14. It’s faster when in performance mode it’s built and looks better and its OLED display meets the needs of photo and video editors in a way that the Envy 14 can’t.

As usual I’ll also offer up the Dell XPS 13 as an alternative. It’s smaller sure with its 13.4-inch 16:10 display but that display is slightly better and the Dell has a much better build quality.

How long will it last?

The Envy 14 is built well enough to last for years of productive service. The components are up to date and should keep up with the typical user’s demands for quite some time. The one-year warranty is disappointing but the industry standard.

Should you buy it?

Yes but not for photo or video editing if tons of accurate colors are required. The Envy 14 is a great productivity machine and should be judged as one rather than the creative powerhouse that HP positions it as.

Smart devices are about as integral to society today as almost any form of technology that we use daily. As the world evolves it certainly seems that entire homes are becoming equipped with enough smart devices for optimal convenience and security. But how do people respond to smart home technology in this day and age? A new study from Cinch Home Services recently found that a majority of people have overall embraced the concept of smart home technology and have a positive sentiment toward it. Specifically 77% of the 1013 people surveyed have welcomed the increasingly common technology. That’s good news considering that smart home tech is expected to grow 57% over the next five years.The survey showed that the perception of smart homes is mostly positive among younger generations though even 69.2% of baby boomers said they feel positively toward smart home tech. Nearly 8 in 10 millennials said the same as did 79.5% of Generation Zers and 75.4% of Gen Xers.Convenience is by far the biggest reason for the embrace of this technology with 94.3% of Gen Z respondents saying it was the biggest factor and 78.2% of baby boomers agreeing. Security was another top reason for the positive sentiment with 70.1% of baby boomers saying they appreciated the security aspects of smart home technology and 62.6% of millennials echoing the sentiment.The least important aspect from respondents when it came to their positive perspective on this technology was energy saving with just 40% of Gen Z respondents saying that saving energy weighed into their views.Interestingly the survey showed a definite correlation between income and a positive sentiment toward smart home technology. According to the results 68.9% of those who shared a positive sentiment had an annual income of under $25000 while 75.1% made between $25000 and $49999 per year. Nearly 82% of those who shared a positive perspective had an annual income of $50000 to $100000 and 80.2% made over $100000 per year.There also seemed to be a fairly strong desire among respondents to acquire more smart tech devices. Specifically 51.3% of those surveyed who owned smart appliances and devices said that they were interested in buying another. Perhaps more telling though is the fact that just 18.5% of those who didn’t have a smart device or appliance said they planned to buy one.A major consideration among respondents when it came to smart home technology was unsurprisingly cost. Almost 30% of those surveyed said they would be willing to pay between $100 and $250 for a smart device or appliance and the percentages consistently dwindled as the prices went up. Fifteen percent of respondents said they would pay between $1000 and $5000 for a device or appliance and only 3.4% said they’d shell out more than $5000.The study also showed that among the 69.1% of respondents who owned at least one smart device or appliance a majority owned more than one. What’s the breakdown of which devices were most prevalent among individuals surveyed? By generation the top device was by far a home assistant or voice hub. Smart security cameras were the second most popular overall but baby boomers specifically preferred smart thermostats and doorbells before cameras. Gen Z respondents’ top two devices were home assistants/voice hubs and smart lights.The fact that voice hubs were the most popular across the board isn’t particularly surprising given the fact that their price range can go from as low as $50 to over $400. That range of affordability is something that can’t be matched as easily by most other smart devices and appliances.When it comes to these devices for most respondents it was all about the brand. Trust in brands mattered significantly among 60.2% of respondents specifically with Amazon being the overall most trusted. Just under 59% of those surveyed favored Amazon while 57.8% preferred Google. The brand with the least preference among respondents overall was Sony with just 41.7% saying it was a trusted brand.Sony was however most popular among baby boomers – 45% said they trusted the company compared to just around 41% among other generations. Interestingly trust in Google was higher among younger generations with 63.4% of millennials and 67.6% of Gen Zers saying they trusted the tech giant.One aspect of the study that was particularly notable was the sentiment surrounding device and technology costs. With the average price of devices owned by respondents being $1149.15 just over half said they feel prices are too high. However 44% say they feel it costs just enough money to have smart devices.With stimulus checks having been sent recently to Americans there’s of course the question of what people would be spending their money on. Overall 26.4% admitted at the time that they planned to spend some or all of their stimulus money on a smart home device or appliance.With technology advancing at an incredible rate there is naturally more demand for smarter tech in various aspects of home life. When it comes to security cameras which are popular among all generations there’s a growing demand for more evolved smart technology – with 45% saying that smart security cameras could stand to be smarter. Smart lights also rated highly for advancement with 31% saying they could see a need for smart lights to evolve.Generally speaking respondents were less interested in their sound systems vacuums and smoke alarms evolving technologically. Twenty-five percent expressed interest in sound systems becoming smarter while only 22% said smart door-locking technology should evolve.The advancement of smart tech is something that shows no sign of stopping anytime soon and if the Cinch survey is any indication people seem to welcome this evolution in many aspects of daily life.Read next: Which Apps Are Responsible for Making You Fed Up of Your Phone Always Running Out of Battery?"

Dunbar hadn’t envisioned a future in the military until she dropped her brother off at the United States Military Academy at West Point and saw other women cadets there. Her parents encouraged her to apply to an academy and a year later she started her education at the Air Force Academy preparing for what would become a 32-year journey of service.

Dunbar’s mother immigrated from Korea in 1947 and soon met the man who would become Dunbar’s father. Together they raised Dunbar and her older brother in central Illinois. When she was growing up her family didn’t have a lot of money so her parents encouraged her to take advantage of the opportunity to get a service academy education and commission.

Dunbar’s parents were very proud to see their daughter serve their country when she started at the Air Force Academy in 1978. In 1982 she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in engineering and business administration and was part of the Academy’s third graduating class to include women.

After graduating Dunbar got married and began to work in the contracting field receiving a variety of different assignments. She earned a Master of Business Administration from California State University in 1984 and in 1991 she was named Contracting Officer of the Year due to her work during the Gulf War. Dunbar was later assigned to be a congressional fellow of the U.S. Senate in Washington D.C. working with Senator Dan Coats in 1996 as part of the legislative fellowship program with the Brookings Institute. She then became the military assistant to the Under Secretary of the Air Force and later the Under Secretary of Defense. In 2000 she earned a master’s degree in national security studies from the National War College in Washington D.C.

Over the course of the next six years Dunbar commanded the 97th mission support squadron the 737th training group and the 75th air base wing. In 2007 Dunbar earned a Ph.D. in public policy at George Washington University. While pursuing her Ph.D. she served as the director of manpower personnel and services for two years at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois. In 2008 she transitioned to Washington D.C. to work at the Pentagon going from director of manpower organization and resources to director of force management policy.

In 2012 Dunbar became the first woman to serve as the commanding general of the Air Force District of Washington and the 320th Air Expeditionary Wing. She was responsible for overseeing operations national security events and ceremonial events in the area including the 57th presidential inauguration. While she was commander she was the Uniform Code of Military Justice authority for 40000 airmen.

As a member of one of the first few Air Force Academy graduating classes with women Dunbar faced many skeptics along the way who only increased her determination to succeed. In an interview with the Air Force she said “Most change in life meets some resistance but change is ultimately how our society and world progress. We couldn’t field or sustain our all-volunteer military today without female service members.”

Dunbar’s service and contributions have done more than sustain the volunteer military. As a commander she had many “opportunities to have an influence and shape people’s lives.” She also worked to make beneficial change for future generations by serving on the Defense Task Force on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence at the Military Service Academies and the Defense Task Force on Sexual Assault in the Military Services.

Dunbar retired from service in 2014 as a major general. She was one of the highest ranking female Asian Americans in the Air Force. Throughout her service Dunbar balanced work with her family life and the responsibility of raising two children with her husband. Dunbar now works at General Dynamics and is the vice president of cross-company business. She also served on the board of directors for the Girl Scouts Nation’s Capital for six years and currently serves on the board of directors for the Armed Services YMCA.

We honor her service.

MAPS is a military technology designed to be installed on vehicles providing soldiers with accurate position navigation and timing data even when the GPS signal is denied degraded or spoofed.

MAPS will be able to fuse PNT data from multiple sources including timing sensors barometer measurements and inertial navigation units creating an alternative that can validate or even replace GPS data.

The new jam-resistant GPS device replaces the Defense Advanced GPS receivers (DAGR) that are currently installed on American armoured vehicles.

In addition earlier in November 2019 General Dynamics Mission Systems part of U.S. aerospace and defense company General Dynamics Corp announced that it has installed similar devices onto U.S. military vehicles in Germany.

The new electronic technology comes amid the Army’s vision for 2028 to best prepare Soldiers for possible warfare with near-peer competitors who have used electronic warfare to disrupt communications vital to Western forces in recent years.

Currently GPS jamming threat is one of Army priorities because jamming and interference can seriously degrade GPS position navigation and time availability – even to the point of total solution denial. Jammers create excessive noise overpowering the low power GPS signals and saturating the electronics in a GPS receiver front end.

According to the latest analysis reports GPS jamming and spoofing threats are increased after the Russian military intervention in Ukraine and Syria.

Russian-linked electronic warfare equipment has been used thousands of times – including outside of the country’s own territories.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGV0aW1lcy10cmlidW5lL25hbWUvbWFyZ2FyZXQtbWFsaW5vd3NraS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD05NzY0NjQ00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Margaret Malinowski Obituary (2021) - Peckville PA - Scranton Times,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/thetimes-tribune/name/margaret-malinowski-obituary?id=9764644 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGV0aW1lcy10cmlidW5lL25hbWUvbWFyZ2FyZXQtbWFsaW5vd3NraS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD05NzY0NjQ00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmliZXJrc2hpcmVzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS82NTA0Ny9EdWx5ZS1MZWFkZXJzaGlwLUV4cGVyaWVuY2UtUGFydGljaXBhbnRzLUNsZWFuLVVwLVBpdHRzZmllbGQtRG93bnRvd24uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dulye Leadership Experience Participants Clean Up Pittsfield Downtown,"Kalee Carmel right Linda Dulye Krystal Blake Katie Kelly Michelle Lopez Michael Laureyns and Melanie Rowe participated in Downtown Pittsfield cleanup on Friday.

Dulye Leadership Experience Participants Clean Up Pittsfield Downtown

PITTSFIELD Mass. — More than a half-dozen members of the Dulye Leadership Experience professional development participated in Friday's Downtown Pittsfield Clean-Up Event.

This is the group's second consecutive year cleaning up the area and is the first time in a year that members have been able to gather in person. This is just the beginning of in-person events that the organization looks forward to in postpandemic times.

The charitable professionals who beautified North Street from Park Square to Columbus Avenue included Marcus Coleman of Raymond James & Associates Kalee Carmel of CompuWorks Michael Laureyns of Laureyns United Melanie Rowe of Raytheon Krystle Blake of General Dynamics Mission Systems Michelle Lopez of the Berkshire Immigrant Center Allison Loring of Willow Investments and President and founder of Dulye & Co. Linda Dulye.

The organization was established in partnership with Syracuse (N.Y.) University in 2008 as an immersive training to prepare undergraduates to successfully transition into the workplace and in 2017 it changed direction to support individuals who are already in the workforce.

Dulye relocated to Berkshire County full time four years ago to become involved in the economic revitalization of the area serving on the Pittsfield Economic Revitalization Corp. board.

""We need a healthy stream of young professionals coming to the Berkshires and wanting to build their careers here"" she said. ""I saw it as a way to really contribute in a positive way a profound way to my new community. ...

""I'm fierce in this commitment because I hear about how wonderful the outdoor assets are here I know that it sure is but we also want to be able to sell ourselves in terms of a great professional development opportunity for somebody young to have a career here and it's affordable to live here versus Boston and New York.""

Before the pandemic DLE hosted in-person programs to help young professionals in Western Massachusettes grow in their careers and build professional relationships.

Dulye said well-attended networking events such as meetups at Otto's Kitchen and Comfort have since become virtual but she expected more in-person opportunities now that pandemic protocols are being lifted.

""We have something called the Breakfast Club and it used to be an in-person event and we met every Friday we actually used to take over tables in the back room of Otto's we'd have about 20 of us and it was really a time for networking for testing out ideas at work or if somebody's looking to maybe make a job move"" she said. ""But it was a very casual informal inclusive experience.""

Dulye settled in an office on North Street in January 2020 right before the COVID-19 pandemic. DLE responded to the ""new normal"" by pivoting to virtual online platforms and was able to maintain its weekly programming.

The free membership is more far-reaching than ever Dulye said because DLE workshops and networking events can be national or even international. While the focus may be on young professionals older generations experiencing job changes may also benefit from DLE resources as well.

""There's this career focus but there's also a focus on creating a supportive environment and that's where the give back is"" Dulye said. ""One of the aspects of coming and becoming a member of the Dulye Leadership Experience is we all have different skills and being able to offer your skills to help somebody else who maybe needs to advance in that area.

""So there's a camaraderie everyone comes in with an open mind and I'll say an open heart to helping each other and it's instantly felt that's the culture that we've kind of built into every one of our programs.""

The LYNX is currently undergoing Risk Mitigation Activity trials in Australia after being shortlisted for the $18.1 – $27.1 billion LAND 400 Phase 3 project to acquire tracked IFVs. It is a next-generation networked and highly protected tracked vehicle which meets the Army’s stringent military requirements for close combat – to defeat an enemy in the most dangerous and lethal environments.

Rheinmetall selected the Cook Defence Systems TR40 track for its lightweight durability and reliability. Cook Defence Systems is already supplying Rheinmetall with tracks for LYNX vehicles under construction for other customers.

Mr William Cook Director of Cook Defence Systems said “We are delighted to be working with Rheinmetall Defence Australia as part of its bid for the LAND 400 Phase 3 project.

“Our proposed TR40 track will have a strong contribution from Australian industry thanks to our long-standing partnership with Mackay Rubber in Victoria.”

Mackay is already a major supplier to Cook Defence Systems for other programmes outside Australia. Mackay’s trackpads are made from an advanced rubber formulation and are proven to provide world-leading durability in the most demanding environments.

“The partnership between Cook Defence Systems and Mackay Rubber is an excellent example of how Rheinmetall is working with its partners in Australia to deliver best of class technology with enduring sovereign capability benefits” said Rheinmetall Defence Australia Managing Director Gary Stewart.

The LYNX will be displayed with the Cook Defence Systems track fitted at the Land Forces international defence exhibition on June 1-3 a showcase for equipment technology and services for the armies of Australia and the Indo-Asia-Pacific.

Rheinmetall is already supplying 211 8x8 BOXER Combat Reconnaissance Vehicles to the Army under LAND 400 Phase 2 and is building industrial capability in Australia."

GCMMF India’s largest dairy cooperative with an annual turnover of ₹52000 crore sells Amul branded dairy products. “Peta wants Amul to snatch livelihood of 100 million poor farmers and handover it's all resources built in 75 years with farmers money to market genetically modified Soya of rich MNC at exorbitant prices which average lower middle class can't afford"" R.S. Sodhi managing director GCMMF said on social media platform Twitter on Friday.

In a 27 May letter addressed to Sodhi PETA said that Amul should look at benefiting from the booming vegan food and milk market.

A vegan diet refers to the practice of avoiding animal products—including abstaining from dairy-based products. The diet largely consists of plants such as vegetables grains nuts and fruits and foods made from plants.

“We would again like to encourage Amul to benefit from the booming vegan food and milk market instead of wasting resources trying to fight the demand for plant-based products that is only growing. Other companies are responding to market changes and Amul can too"" PETA said.

GCMMF is owned by 3.6 million farmers. Of these around 2.6 million farmers bring their milk twice daily to 18600 village societies from where chilled milk is transported to district milk unions for processing into packaged milk and value-added products. The products then reach over a billion consumers daily through 10000 distributors and a million retailers Mint reported earlier.

Sodhi further asked whether PETA will give livelihood dairy farmers—70% of which are landless. “…who will pay for children school fee .. how many can afford expensive lab manufactured factory food made out of chemicals ... And synthetic vitamins.""

In its letter PETA had added that globally several companies are capitalizing on the growing consumer shift towards dairy alternatives. For instance Nestlé the world’s largest food maker is already profiting from the pervasive demand for vegan milk through its acquisition of Ecuador’s Terrafertil PETA said.

Amul could certainly profit from the rising interest in vegan products such as vegan cheeses yogurts the animal rights group wrote in its letter.

It cited data from a report by Grand View Research saying that demand for vegan food and beverages has led to the global dairy alternatives market to reach an estimated $52.58 billion by 2028.

“Changing consumer preferences caused by environmental or moral concerns resulting in the mass adoption of vegan or similar diets are expected to positively impact the market growth over the forecast period"" it said in its letter citing research.

""French dairy giant Danone acquired a non-dairy milk manufacturer in 2016 and dedicated a new building entirely to its non-dairy products including yogurt. US-based General Mills has its own dairy-free yogurt made from coconut milk for its Yoplait brand and the Canadian dairy group Saputo has launched a dairy-free range. Last year India’s dairy business Epigamia launched coconut milk yogurts as part of its goal to contemporise the Indian dairy industry"" PETA added.

Professor Coaldrake named “industrial-scale cheating” as one of the “emerging big threats” that the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (Teqsa) would have to address. “We’re dealing with an incredibly fast-paced sort of industry here and one that does present a profound challenge to us collectively” he told the Needed Now in Teaching and Learning conference.

Professor Coaldrake confirmed that the agency was already pursuing a case using a law passed late last year but said the process was expensive. “I asked our general counsel ‘How much is [it] going to cost us and how many of these could we afford?’ Teqsa doesn’t have the resources to be fighting multiple cases in the federal court.”

He said that the agency would “do what we need to do within our resources but we’re all in this together. We’re keen to…utilise the intelligences coming through from research groups across the sector to link up with international groups through government authorities to do all those things.”

Teqsa has warned the sector that contract cheating companies are infiltrating university websites on a tip-off from US researchers and that students who accept part-time jobs promoting “online study platforms” could risk prosecution. In its most recent advisory it shared data from Australian researchers scrutinising commercial cheating services’ global activities.

The research identified more than 2600 potentially plagiarised assignments submitted to more than 60 institutions including 34 universities in Australia alone. Plagiarism detection giant Turnitin supported the project by allowing the researchers to run suspect papers through its similarity checking services.

Times Higher Education understands that the organisation Teqsa is prosecuting was identified through other means. A spokesman for the agency said that the case would “test the legislation and inform our subsequent approach”.

Needed Now conference convenor Sally Kift said Australia was fortunate that the world’s “premier assessment research centre” at Deakin University had done “exceptional work” on assessment security. Professor Coaldrake said his agency valued scholarly groups’ contributions. “We’re seeking…to share the fruits of that work.”

He added that while he was not critical of universities that had “loaded up” on international students prior to the pandemic the crisis had “confounded” assumptions about institutional risk. “Some of the most prominent institutions will be working through the upending of their risk profiles” he said.

“Institutions which might have been seen to be traditionally high risk – smaller regional less developed and so on – might actually have less risk. They’ll have different risks but cumulatively perhaps less risk in the short term.”

He signalled that Teqsa would not move against universities with “vast risks” so long as they had their problems “well in hand. It’s when risks are apparent but people are sleepwalking through them – that’s where you’d be concerned. I think there’d be a good less sleepwalking in the higher education space than there might have been a couple of years ago.”

Professor Coaldrake said Teqsa was considering “quite a number” of applications from institutions seeking university college status with decisions due before July. “It’s slightly ironic that I was the person who reviewed the provider category standards and I’m now administering the application of them” he admitted.

To some this may be common knowledge but to others we suspect this will be the kind of news that will leave you scratching your head and asking just how the Forester has even the slightest relation to Chevrolet.

The answer is actually quite simple. In 1999 General Motors purchased a 20.1 per cent stake in Fuji Heavy Industries the conglomerate that owns Subaru (and would be renamed Subaru Corporation in 2017). While GM sold and divested its entire stake in the Japanese company in 2005 there was a time when it decided to take the Forester slap Chevrolet badges on it and sell it in India.

It is difficult to know just how many examples of the Chevrolet Forester were sold in India but it was apparently available for four years before being axed after GM sold its stake in Fuji Heavy Industries. While searching through the classifieds in India we did stumble upon a couple of used examples that were listed for sale in recent years such as the blue example below from Cartoq but weren’t able to find any that are currently available.

GM will restart two plants in Mexico one in the U.S. one in Canada and another in South Korea according to a statement Thursday. The Canadian plant and another in Mexico are key because they build the GMC Terrain and Chevrolet Equinox small sport utility vehicles which are popular family vehicles and often purchased by rental car companies.

(WMTV) -The General Motors plant in Janesville was the life blood of that city for decades and now a historic piece of the plant is up for sale.

A nearly 20-year-old GMC C8500 dump truck is on the auction block. The truck is last of its kind to roll off the assembly line at the Janesville GM plant. The truck was completed on June 26th 2002. The truck then served the City of Janesville for almost two decades.

The line that made those heavy duty vehicles was moved to a plant in Michigan. Seven years later in 2009 GM closed for good.

“Well I think back then and for a lot of years it (GM) was the heart of the city” said Travis Kelsey the shop crew leader at the city’s service center. “I think a lot of things that happened here happened from the plant or because of the plant and a lot of generations worked at the plant”

The truck was initially used for light duty projects. But after a few years the truck was put to work and carried around asphalt for the city. It has roughly 65000 miles on it and Kelsey says it runs well.

Under the hood you’ll also find the names of several GM workers who helped build the truck in 2002.

“The more and more we looked at it and did repairs the more places we found signatures” said Kelsey. “On the frame under the hood firewall. There was signatures inside on the rims when we changed the tires for the first time”

Trucks like this one in the city’s fleet usually have a lifespan of about 15 years but this one lasted close to 20 years. Kelsey is hoping someone locally buys the truck so this piece of Janesville history stays put.

Kelsey thinks the truck can go for roughly $7000 or $8000.

Whether or not it forms a valid criticism of customer research is another matter. However there can be no argument that this kind of research is extremely important in the case of something like the GM Defense ISV (Infantry Squad Vehicle).

Here the important perspective is not that of the customer (the U.S. military) paying for the vehicle but rather its users (the soldiers). As a result of soldier feedback the production-intent GM Defense ISV has received a small but important improvement.

This is not a question of performance or strength or off-road ability but one about the mud flaps. As those closely following the ISV’s journey to production might remember original prototypes were not fitted with mud flaps and end users didn’t like that.

“Soldiers told us they were getting pelted with stones flying off wheels so in went the mud flaps” engineers told GM Authority during a recent event commemorating the start of production at the GM Defense plant in North Carolina.

GM fitted mud flaps only to the front wheels since stones (or anything else for that matter) flying off the ISV’s rear wheels are not the problem of the occupants. They are not easy to see from most angles being black in color and mounted below chassis level. But since that’s where the stone will come from we can assume they are effective.

The mud flaps are very wide and would not fit on a regular vehicle such as the Chevy Colorado ZR2 pickup truck on which the GM Defense ISV is based. However despite the very obvious differences between the ISV and the ZR2 around 70 percent of components are shared between the two including the 2.8L I4 LWN turbodiesel Duramax engine.

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has commissioned GM to provide 649 units of the GM Defense ISV for $214.3 million which includes providing appropriate vehicle support. Early examples were built at a GM facility in Michigan but regular production will take place at the recently-inaugurated production facility in North Carolina.

Lotus is on the revitalization track:

The vehicle lineup of the British car company founded by the late Colin Chapman (and now controlled by Geely of China which also owns Volvo) is being overhauled. On the chopping block are the Lotus Exige Elise and Evora two-seaters the latter being the only model currently available in North America. The Evija a battery-electric vehicle will launch later this year. According to Lotus it will produce close to 2000 horsepower and more than 1250 pound-feet of torque. Another new sports car referred to as the Type 131 will be built on a unique platform and will use a hybrid power system. Also in the pipeline is a utility vehicle to be built at Geely’s manufacturing facility in China. All upcoming Lotus variants are expected to be available in North America.

In a mere 14 years the automaker intends to sell its very last internal-combustion-powered passenger vehicle. GM CEO Mary Barra said however that in some instances where the technology doesn’t exist by then the company will purchase offsetting carbon credits and/or initiate “carbon capture” procedures. “Our preference will always be for removal of emissions” Barra said. “This is a critical step on the path to a net-zero-carbon future.” General Motors currently sells the Chevrolet Bolt EV but a number of additional battery-electric vehicles of all types are in the pipeline from the company and are expected to begin arriving for the 2022 model year.

The Expedition is coming in for significant updating

The Sleuth has learned that Ford’s big utility vehicle (and competitor to the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban) will sport new looks inside and out for 2022. Changes include a new front-end design and a new dashboard for the cabin incorporating an oversize tablet-style touch-screen. For propulsion the current twin-turbocharged 3.5-litre V-6 with 375 horsepower and 470 pound-feet of torque is expected to return while a hybrid system rated at 430 horsepower and 570 pound-feet (optional in the 2021 Ford F-150) is rumoured to be coming to the Expedition’s option list.

Hydrogen or battery-electric for commercial vehicles?

The Sleuth notes that General Motors will supply hydrogen-fuel-cell stacks to truckmaker Navistar for use in an upcoming Class 8 big rig. After testing has been completed Navistar plans to have the vehicle up and running by 2024. Sweden-based Scania rated as the world’s 10th largest large-truck maker has tested both hydrogen and battery-electric power systems and has instead decided to stick with batteries. Which is better? Scania says that it takes three times as much renewable energy to power its trucks with hydrogen as opposed to battery-electric power. Also noted was the cost and complexity of hydrogen-vehicle production plus concerns about the volatility of the fuel.

Has the next Nissan Frontier just been revealed?

That appears likely The Sleuth surmises after viewing images of the 2021 Nissan Navara that was recently unveiled in the Philippines. Although that vehicle is clearly intended for markets outside North America the 2022 Frontier that launches later this year will likely use the same body-on-frame construction. The bodywork could also carry over to the Frontier. The one major difference will be in the engine compartment where the current Frontier’s 310-horsepower 3.8-litre V-6 will carry over. The Navara gets a turbo-diesel. Both of the Frontier’s extended King Cab and four-door Crew Cab models will also continue to be offered.

UPS AND DOWNS

Up: A new production-car land-speed record has been set: SSC North America based in Washington state can now claim bragging rights for this accomplishment. On Jan. 17 over a 2.3-mile (3.7-kilometre) straightaway a two-way average speed of 282.9 mph (452 km/h) was achieved in one of the company’s US $1.9-million midengine Tuatara supercars. The two-seater is equipped with a twin-turbocharged 5.9-litre V-8 rated at 1750 horsepower and 1280 pound-feet of torque. The speed bested the previous 277.9 mph (445 km/h) record set by a Koenigsegg RS in 2017.

SRI HARI MANGALAM and PRITISH RAJ explain what compulsory licensing legally entails within the Indian IP laws framework and why India must follow the lead of several other countries and use this tool to boost its COVID drug supplies.

—-

A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court comprising of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud L. Nageswara Rao and S. Ravindra Bhat recently asked the government to consider invoking compulsory licensing under the Patents Act 1970 to address the shortage of Remdesivir Favipiravar and other Covid-19 related drugs. The court asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta why the government had not yet invoked the relevant portions of the Patents Act to support manufacturing in the country. The Supreme Court’s observations were based on the premise that in a national health crisis the government should make use of the flexibility offered under the Patent Act to increase the production of lifesaving drugs.

Compulsory licensing is often used as a medium of ensuring equalitarian access to medical utilities in exigent situations and has been used by many countries to fight COVID-19. India along with South Africa is already leading the global TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Agreement waiver movement for COVID-19 vaccines and the country should ideally adopt the same stance with regard to other pandemic related drugs. The government could immediately assume control and boost production; however incorporating compulsory licensing provisions in a country with thousands of political leaders and even more opinions and policy ideas is easier said than done.

We will analyse the idea of compulsory licensing under the Patents Act in India study the global use of this principle to deal with the pandemic and argue why adopting the said IP implement is important for the country.

What does Compulsory Licensing mean?

A compulsory license in the simplest of terms is a license issued by the government to an applicant so as to allow it to manufacture sell and/ or distribute a patented product without the permission of the patentee. It is one of the flexibilities of patent law both in the national and international sphere and has been a part of the TRIPS Agreement since its incorporation in January 1995. In most cases compulsory licensing involves the production of a generic copy of the patented good primarily for domestic use and not for exportation. Its most basic purpose is to ensure equitable access to essential goods.

However critics argue against the implementation since it discourages pharma companies and other manufacturers from producing new drugs and takes away an inventor’s monopoly. Experts also argue that using this IP implement is equivalent to tearing an owner’s patent; however that is hardly the case. The patent owner retains his or her rights over the good including the right to receive compensation for copies of the product produced under a compulsory license.

The primary benefit of these licenses is that they make essential patented goods accessible to all individuals regardless of their socio-economic backgrounds and not to take away an inventor’s right to be compensated. Their usage has allowed nations to promptly counter medical emergencies and is used globally to ensure equitable access.

The Global Approach

The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health in 2001 highlighted a key provision of the TRIPS agreement i.e. Article 31 emphasizing a signatory’s right to grant compulsory licences.

This provision has been used by various countries to tackle urgent public health situations and almost twenty nations have either issued or publicly entertained compulsory licences for pharmaceutical products since 1995. In the 2000s Brazil Ecuador Ghana Indonesia Malaysia Mozambique Thailand Rwanda Zambia and Zimbabwe issued compulsory licenses for specific antiretroviral drugs to combat the growing cases of HIV/AIDs in their country. Among these countries Ghana and Zimbabwe issued compulsory licences for all antiretroviral related drugs. Using compulsory licensing allowed these countries to provide low-cost treatment to their citizens and control the rising HIV cases.

Similarly many nations have adopted the distributed-patents approach to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. In March last year Israel issued a compulsory licence for a drug called ritonavir which the country thought could be a possible medicine for COVID-19 patients. The license was issued to increase the supply of the drug in the country since the usual producers were unable to cope with the increasing demand. Additionally Canada amended its Patents Act to issue speedier compulsory licenses while putting in place safeguards to protect the interests of patent holders and ensure they receive adequate remuneration.

Developing South American States Chile and Ecuador have introduced different legislative implements to issue compulsory licences for COVID-19 related drugs. Chile passed a proposal declaring the Coronavirus pandemic a health crisis which satisfies the need to grant compulsory licences. Similarly the Ecuadorian National Assembly passed a resolution that mandates the country’s president to issue compulsory licences for COVID-19 drugs and ensure that the citizens have health support and equitable access to essential drugs.

Evidently many countries around the globe have adopted this implement to ensure sufficient medical support for their citizens. India has supported the TRIPS waiver proposal and the introduction of this implement domestically would be a step forward for the country. However introducing such a license in India is easier said than done due to multiple contentious issues.

The Indian legal framework

The idea of compulsory licenses is not alien to India. In addition to numerous other international statutes and declarations Indian IP laws also incorporate provisions related to compulsory licensing. Section 84 of the Patents Act deals with compulsory licenses. It postulates three grounds on which a compulsory license can be granted by the Controller General of Patents Design and Trade Marks. The grounds are:

A reasonable requirement of citizens has not been satisfied with respect to the patented invention. The patented invention is generally unavailable at an affordable rate. The patented invention isn’t worked/manufactured in India.

The disjunctive nature of this provision provides considerable leeway to the controller general while granting licenses.

The Indian higher judiciary has laid down certain aspects of the framework for this provision as well. In the landmark case of Bayer Corporation vs. Union of India and Others (162 (2009) DLT 371) the Bombay High Court delved into the nuances of compulsory licensing under the Indian Patents Act. The court upheld the decision of the Controller to grant compulsory license to another company to manufacture life-saving drug as all three requirements under Section 84 of the Patents Act had been followed. The ruling sets a favourable precedence for the current situation.

Unfortunately on a closer reading of Section 84 an essential condition precedent to granting compulsory licenses emerges: compulsory licenses can only be granted after three years have elapsed from the date of grant of a patent to the concerned parent company. This statutory hurdle can only be surpassed if the government amends the said provision and eliminates this condition. What is of particular importance is the fact that the medicine for COVID-19 was first manufactured in the year 2020 itself. Hence if the government leaves the provision unamended it will evidently result in undue delay in the manufacture and the distribution of Remdesivir around the country.

Voluntary Licensing Agreement

An alternative to compulsory licensing is a voluntary licensing agreement.

The present manufacturers of Remdesivir in India themselves do not hold patent rights of remdesivir; instead they have signed non-exclusive agreement with or received voluntary permission from the American biopharmaceutical giant Gilead Sciences to manufacture remdesivir in India. Such voluntary licensing agreements have ensured smooth transfer of essential scientific methodology to these companies as well as the manufacturing and distribution rights of the said medicines in India.

However these voluntary licenses have been granted only to a handful of companies to manufacture the said medicine in a country with a billion strong population. To increase its production public pharma companies or government itself can enter into voluntary license agreements with Gilead to manufacture Remdeivir thereby providing impetus to its manufacture in India.

Union Government’s stance

While the debate on enforcement of compulsory licensing rises around the world the union government seems to be humming an altogether different tune. Despite the Supreme Court’s suggestion to implement compulsory licensing in India the government appears unwilling to enforce it.

Instead the government has cautioned that even the mention of compulsory licensing by higher echelons in the government can have an adverse consequences on the international platform. However it fails to elaborate upon the contention that how mass production of life saving drugs can in any way have negative consequences. This vague stance by the government has predictably increased the uncertainty around the issue of drug supply and its sufficiency in the near future.

It is clear that granting licenses to manufacture Remdesivir and other COVID-19 related medicines to multiple companies in the nation will provide impetus to the war against the pandemic. However other than the three-year requirement which accompanies the grant of compulsory licenses another contentious issue is that of ensuring that the quality of particular licensed drugs does not depreciate with its rise in production.

While companies that are currently manufacturing Remdesivir in India have years of experience and expertise to ensure that the quality of the drug does not depreciate the same cannot be considered true for numerous other pharma companies. Hence whether it is a compulsory licence or a voluntary alternative neither should be provided to a company unless it can produce medicines of the requisite quality.

The move comes amid growing international concern and awareness about rights and labor abuses by Chinese companies operating overseas.

On Monday a judge of the U.S. District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands ordered a Hong Kong company to pay seven Chinese construction workers $5.4 million in compensation for forced labor human trafficking and workplace injuries during their employment on the Imperial Pacific casino construction site in Garapan Saipan.

Chief Judge Ramona Villagomez Manglona issued a default judgment on May 24 against Imperial Pacific International (IPI) for forcing the Chinese workers to toil in “extreme dangerous and inhumane work conditions” on the casino construction site. The workers had been “recruited in China … under false promises” entered Saipan on tourist visas arranged by the defendants and were housed in “repugnant” dorms according to the judgment.

Breakdown of awards

The judge ordered IPI which is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange to pay the workers $2.9 million in compensatory damages and the same amount in punitive damages offset by the amount paid to the plaintiffs in settlements with other defendants.

Individual awards depend on several factors including the severity of injuries pain and suffering; days worked; and the projected amount of lost future earnings. A default judgment occurs “when a party fails to respond to a court-ordered action” according to the Cornell Law School legal information site.

The case was filed in 2019 against the plaintiffs’ former employers Gold Mantis a subsidiary of Suzhou Gold Mantis Construction Decoration; MCC International Saipan owned by Metallurgical Corp. of China; and IPI owner of the casino under construction.

MCC was the general contractor on the casino project and employed three of the workers according to the judgment. MCC charged each worker $2000 for the job then forced the workers to buy their own protective gear threatened to send them to China “given their unlawful status” and told them that “their complaints were useless given their immigration status.”

Four — and eventually all — of the plaintiffs worked for Gold Mantis which charged each worker $1000 for the job according to the ruling. A manager “threatened to physically harm and kill employees” according to the court document. It continued: “All seven Plaintiffs sustained injuries during the course of their employment with Gold Mantis.”

IPI did not answer emails from VOA Mandarin.

Settlements

MCC and Gold Mantis settled with the plaintiffs for undisclosed sums. VOA Mandarin attempted to speak with both companies. Gold Mantis did not answer when telephoned and contact information was unavailable for MCC.

Officials with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Districts of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands told VOA Mandarin they were not authorized to discuss the case.

Aaron Halegua the plaintiffs’ lawyer and a research fellow at New York University School of Law told VOA Mandarin that his clients did not want to talk to reporters. He said he was pleased that the court had recognized the egregiousness of IPI’s conduct.

“This is an important decision because eradicating forced labor requires that perpetrators of such abuses face serious consequences” he told VOA Mandarin via phone.

If IPI fails to pay the plaintiffs as ordered Halegua said his team would take steps to collect the judgment such as attaching the company’s assets in Saipan.

The workers’ troubles originated with IPI’s successful bid “for a single Saipan gaming license in November 2014 after promising to make … fixed payments to the cash-strapped island. Unusually it is not required to pay any tax on revenues” according to the trade website Casino.org.

The company had no experience in building or operating casinos the site reported and delays dogged the controversial project.

“In March 2017 a construction worker died after falling from a scaffold on the casino construction site prompting an FBI investigation” according to Casino.

“This led agents to uncover widespread visa violations among the workers who had been brought to Saipan from China. Two contractors were ultimately charged with importing and harboring illegal aliens.”

Injuries recorded

Bloomberg reported in 2018 that the staff at Saipan’s single hospital kept an unofficial spreadsheet of injuries of Chinese laborers working on the project describing “a grim catalog of broken bones lacerations puncture wounds dislocated limbs and eyes penetrated by flying metal.”

Halegua told VOA that while members of his legal team had originally filed for work injuries they gradually realized that the workers' descriptions of their treatment indicated forced labor.

""The real focus in this context is whether the person was free to stop working or whether they were somehow coerced to continue working” he told VOA Mandarin in a Skype interview.

Halegua said that taking away passports delaying salary and making threats are “tools that employers can use to coerce the workers to make them feel that they have to keep working otherwise they will suffer harm. And that's really the essence of human trafficking and forced labor.” He said the terms are often used interchangeably.

New York City-based rights group China Labor Watch issued a report last month saying that Chinese companies involved in China’s Belt and Road Initiative had abused Chinese workers in at least 22 countries.

Long hours curbs on movement

According to the report the abuses included passport retention “restrictions on freedom of movement excessive work hours up to 12 hours a day and 7 days a week zero holiday allowance unpaid wages issuance of illegal visas deceptive recruitment and false promises.”

The report added that workers’ “basic human rights have been severely violated but because they are abroad it is difficult to seek protection under Chinese law and the Chinese companies that force these workers to work often get away with it.”

Li Qiang founder of China Labor Watch told VOA via phone that the ruling would have implications for future cases regarding forced labor issues.

“This ruling can be applied to all future cases in the U.S. involving forced labor or the illegal use of visa” he said. “Meanwhile if a specific company faces forced labor allegations for its operation overseas and if the company is either in the U.S. has relationship with a U.S. company or has assets in the U.S. this ruling can be cited to some extent as well.”

Halegua agreed. He told VOA Mandarin that based on his experience forced labor practices are fairly common among Chinese workers who are hired to work on overseas projects by Chinese companies. Usually the companies are not punished which is why the seven workers’ case against ICI will have implications for the construction industry beyond Saipan he said.

“This case shows that the court takes this behavior very seriously and that there are very serious consequences for employers that engage in forced labor” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMzEvZmlybXMtc2hvdWxkLXBheS1tb3JlLWZvci1wb2xsdXRpb24tdW4tc3BlY2lhbC1lbnZveS1mb3ItY2xpbWF0ZS1tYXJrLWNhcm5leS5odG1s0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjEvMDUvMzEvZmlybXMtc2hvdWxkLXBheS1tb3JlLWZvci1wb2xsdXRpb24tdW4tc3BlY2lhbC1lbnZveS1mb3ItY2xpbWF0ZS1tYXJrLWNhcm5leS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Companies should pay more for pollution says UN special envoy on climate action Mark Carney,"Mark Carney attends a session during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on January 21 2020.

Companies should be paying more for the pollution they generate says Mark Carney the United Nations special envoy on climate action and finance. Carbon pricing is one of the methods used to incentivize businesses to reduce greenhouse gas emissions — by making them pay for pollution the create. Some governments impose taxes on carbon emissions while others set up systems where emissions are capped and extra allowances can be bought or sold in the form of ""carbon credits."" According to the International Monetary Fund the global average carbon price in 2019 was $2 per ton — and Carney said the charges need to be much higher.

""They've been set far too low — single digits on average globally well short of the estimated $80 to $100 a ton needed by the end of this decade to keep us on track to net zero"" he said during a virtual event organized by the INSEAD Hoffmann Global Institute for Business and Society on Tuesday. That figure is higher than projections by the IMF which said carbon taxes should be $75 a ton by 2030.

Transition challenges

As economies move toward future with net-zero carbon emissions structural changes will leave some sectors uncompetitive said Carney who was previously governor of the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada. The energy sector for example would require decades of investments and support as the transition takes place.

The catastrophic impacts of climate change will largely fall on future generations and the current generation … has few direct incentives to solve it. Mark Carney United Nations special envoy on climate action and finance

""(It's) one of the toughest things for governments to do in order to … ensure that the longer term benefits to society are spread more immediately to those who are more impacted"" he said. However there are areas of ""absolute alignment"" between short-term economic benefits and medium-term climate benefits he added. ""There are certain climate policies that are job heavy they're investment heavy they have high multipliers for GDP"" he said citing the example of retrofits to make buildings energy efficient. He also said the investment opportunity in energy is at least $100 trillion over the next few decades.

Dangerous trade-offs

Still the world has been not been investing enough to address the climate crisis Carney said. One reason is that humans can be ""irrationally impatient"" and value the present much more than the future.

""The catastrophic impacts of climate change will largely fall on future generations and the current generation … has few direct incentives to solve it – even though if we act sooner it will be less costly"" he added. Decisions have also been made in a utilitarian way Carney said. ""This encourages a trade-off between growth today and crisis tomorrow between health and economics between planet and profit.""

Climate summit COP26

Politicians are set to meet in the U.K. in November for the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) to discuss coordinated action. The meeting will also put in place elements so that ""every private financial decision can take climate change into account"" Carney said. He said that can be achieved in four ways: Sustainability reports: ""What gets measured can be managed"" said Carney. ""That's why we're pushing globally to have a common set of reporting around the risks related to climate change that companies face."" Stress tests: Banks and insurance companies need to be tested against possible environmental scenarios. ""In effect we need to bring the future towards the present so that financial institutions can think about whether their strategies are resilient"" Carney said. Tapping on mainstream finance: More than 160 banks asset owners asset managers and insurers joined the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero — which Carney says is the ""gold standard for commitments to sustainability."" The goal is to help all companies move toward net-zero emissions by 2050. ""It's a breakthrough in mainstreaming climate finance"" he said. Build markets: Markets for blended finance and carbon offsets need to be developed he said. The latter market — where carbon credits can be traded to offset its emissions — could be worth more than 75 billion euros ($91.3 billion) Carney said.

Addressing skepticism

Under the 2015 Paris Agreement countries agreed to stop global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius but ""collectively failed to stop the growth in global greenhouse emissions"" the UN Environment Programme said. Acknowledging that previous climate conferences and agreements have not always produced results Carney said things could be different at COP26. There's more clarity about where the world stands and what needs to be done — which has led to some progress he said.

[shareaholic app=""share_buttons"" id=""13106399""]

It’s already been a busy year for construction thanks to surges in new housing development and renovations as well as changes to businesses brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors will likely accelerate already strong growth projections for the industry made prior to 2020. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) construction employment was projected to grow at a faster pace than average between 2019 and 2029—adding 4% more jobs compared to 3.7% for other industries. Among the jobs anticipated to be most in demand are solar photovoltaic installers (up 50.5%) tile and stone workers (up 8.6%) and electricians (up 8.4%).

Those and other construction occupations tend to be financially rewarding relative to the level of education required for entry. The vast majority of construction jobs require no formal education or a high school diploma yet they pay $906 per week—nearly as much as the $938 median weekly earnings of someone with an associate’s degree from college. The median earnings for high school graduates is $781 a week while those without a diploma make $619.

While construction workers are generally paid well their paychecks vary widely depending on where they work. The West Coast (including Alaska and Hawaii) pockets in the Midwest and several Northeast states all pay construction workers higher hourly wages than the rest of the country. Hawaii and Illinois for example have a median hourly wage above $34 while Alaska and Massachusetts are around $30 per hour. Meanwhile several states across the South pay as low as $18 per hour for construction work.

The type of construction work is also a major factor in how well employees are paid. Many of the higher rates fall to areas of specialization like elevator installers boilermakers and pile-driver operators. However general construction supervisors inspectors and more common tradespeople like electricians can also earn higher pay rates.

To find the best-paying construction jobs researchers at Construction Coverage analyzed the latest data from the BLS. Occupations were ranked according to their median hourly wage. Researchers also included median annual wages total and projected 10-year employment numbers and the percentage of workers that are self-employed for each occupation.

Here are the best-paying construction jobs in the United States.

Paul Joplin knew from his 27-year career in the U.S. Army that he enjoyed working with people from around the world. He had already spent time in Alabama Kentucky Georgia and Florida as well as in Vietnam Iran and Korea.

""I never really found my niche in the civilian world"" Joplin says ""so I was ready to do whatever the Lord wanted. I said 'I am available to go anyplace and do anything that you want me to do.'""

That vow led him to the things he has found most rewarding.

Joplin had moved back to his hometown Magnolia after retirement. He worked in insurance and real estate before running for Columbia County sheriff.

""I guess it was in my blood"" he says.

His grandfather was sheriff in Polk County and his father also ran for the post in Columbia County. His great-grandfather too was a sheriff.

""I would say everybody ought to run for political office at some point in their lives"" he says. ""It's quite a learning experience.""

Shortly after the ballots for Columbia County sheriff were tallied -- ""I didn't win"" he says -- Joplin and his wife Karen left on a mission trip to Portugal.

They had allowed their passports to expire after his retirement but renewed them in preparation for the Portugal trip. Just a couple of weeks after they returned from Portugal someone from Samaritan's Purse International Relief asked if he could help build a refugee camp in Albania. His paperwork was in order and he was ready to go.

He arrived in Tirana Albania in June 1999 just as NATO bombing ceased in Kosovo and he helped start the rebuilding process there.

A few of the men working with Samaritan's Purse were involved in a fender bender. The Albanians in the van they hit were armed and demanding money well beyond the cost of damages. One of the men was held hostage while the others were allowed to return to camp to get Joplin.

Joplin at the scene of the wreck said a prayer and flagged down a passing patrol truck. The lieutenant in charge directed both parties to follow him back to patrol headquarters but they were ultimately told to sort out the issue among themselves.

Joplin signaled his guys to head for their vehicle.

""I knew my way around Hamallaj [Albania] well enough by that time and I gave the slip to the Albanians. That's how we got out of that fix"" says Joplin happy to have been able to help.

He left for a five-year stint in Egypt just a month after returning from Albania contracting with the U.S. Army Security Assistance Command. After a short break back in the United States he returned to Egypt for another three years.

""We were there when they had the revolution in Egypt"" he says. ""We were evacuated from Egypt because I was attached to the U.S. Embassy.""

In 2014 Joplin offered to go on a medical mission trip to Rwanda if there was a place for him. For that trip he learned how to fit people with eyeglasses.

""I put glasses on a lady and she looked and said 'No not those' and I put another pair on her"" he says. ""All of a sudden the biggest smile broke out on her face and she looked up and she said 'I can read my Bible now.'""

Joplin hadn't mapped out this rewarding experience but he had learned to trust that sometimes things just fell into place.

He joined the U.S. Army in 1961 after graduating from Ouachita Baptist College (now University) in Arkadelphia. He expected to serve two years in the Army followed by six months in the Army Reserve.

Beyond that he says ""I had no plans.""

In 1964 he applied for flight school almost on a whim. He got in did well and became a pilot instructor in Fort Rucker Ala. before he was sent to Vietnam.

In the 173rd Assault Helicopter Company Joplin's duty involved flying infantry into areas where Vietcong were present or suspected to be and then resupplying those men as needed.

""One unit was out in the field and we landed and while they were off-loading supplies one of the young soldiers came running up to the helicopter"" Joplin says.

The soldier handed Joplin a postcard he had written for someone back home asking if he would mail it for him.

""That was very special"" Joplin says his voice cracking with emotion ""that I could do that for that soldier.""

Joplin ran his first marathon at 75 and has run two more since. While training to run Joplin discovered yoga which helps counter the effects of a back injury he got in a helicopter crash during training in 1965.

""Yoga seems to be helping me stay in good physical shape and not have the problems that a lot of folks my age have"" he says.

He's grateful for that and for other opportunities life has afforded.

""I was very fortunate in the things that I was able to do and I worked with some good men for some good men"" he says. ""I've been so blessed by being in the military.""

Grasso is now 96 living a long life in Norwood enriched by the love of three daughters six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

In November 1944 Anthony Grasso was a 19-year-old private from Needham Mass. when a German artillery shell exploded near his position. Grasso suffered serious head wounds in the battle blood spurting from his neck. He survived but his lieutenant Frank DuBose took the brunt of the explosion shielding his radioman with his body.

CAMDEN S.C. — It was a moment 76 years in the making a graveside pilgrimage that reunited two World War II veterans of the horrific Battle of Hürtgen Forest on the German frontier a tribute tinged with sorrow searing memories and gratitude without bounds.

And on Friday the two were joined again for the first time in three-quarters of a century when Grasso visited DuBose’s grave in this backcountry Southern town.

“You gave your life to save mine” Grasso said through tears as he laid a white rose on DuBose’s headstone.

Frail and stooped Grasso had insisted on traveling to the lush tree-fringed cemetery where DuBose is buried and to thank him finally for the precious chance to lead a long life because of his sacrifice.

Lifted from a wheelchair by a grandson and a friend Grasso stood in front of the headstone blessed himself and began to weep. As he did Grasso grasped the stone with two hands and leaned forward his bowed head nearly touching the marker.

“I pay my respects for what we had together until that day” Grasso said his words slow and clear in the cemetery’s hush.

Grasso had also come to say goodbye this Memorial Day weekend something that had been denied him on the battlefield. As more and more World War II veterans pass away he knew it was his last chance.

“I hope we meet again in the future” Grasso said. “God bless you and thank you.”

Grasso had wanted to visit DuBose’s grave for decades but did not know where he was buried. As his life went on Grasso never forgot the soft-spoken graduate of Clemson University a young officer whom he shadowed day and night as the 112th Regiment of the 28th Infantry Division fought its way to the heavily fortified Siegfried Line on the embattled edge of Germany.

“How can you forget? You slept with him; you did everything with him” Grasso said in an interview before the trip. “I had always wanted to visit his grave. If it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t be here.”

Drafted while still a student at Needham High School Grasso went off to war as an 18-year-old son of Italian immigrants. He had never been kissed or gone on a date.

When Grasso returned he suffered from shell shock what now is known as PTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder. He became angry and bitter but he managed to move past much of the trauma raise a family and drive trucks all over New England for Sealtest ice cream for 47 years.

“I would ask ‘Why him? Why not the both of us?’ ” Grasso said.

Chuck Sturkey a Marine Corps veteran of the Vietnam War helped steady Grasso as he leaned toward the grave. Wounded three times and posted at beleaguered Khe Sanh Sturkey said he knows well the pain of losing close comrades in battle.

“It’s with you all the time” Sturkey said.

The Battle of Hürtgen Forest was a monthslong fight in rugged sometimes impenetrable terrain where well-fortified Germans were determined to prevent an advance into their homeland. At least 33000 American soldiers were killed or wounded in the protracted battle and Allied strategy and tactics have long been criticized.

DuBose’s job on Nov. 2 1944 was to scout German positions for US artillery units which would bombard the area before the 112th Regiment advanced. During the reconnaissance Grasso remained constantly at DuBose’s side carrying a 40-pound radio pack on his back so the lieutenant could quickly relay coordinates of the enemy’s position.

As the pair moved through an open field DuBose believed he saw enemy soldiers in the woods ahead.

“The last words I heard from him were ‘I need to call in. Give me the phone’ “ Grasso said. “He was picking up the phone and ‘Boom!’ I went flying in the air the blood spilling out of my neck. The next thing I know I woke up two weeks later in a hospital in Paris.”

DuBose had turned to Grasso’s back reaching for the phone when the blast threw the lieutenant 30 feet in the air. But at the instant of explosion he had provided enough of a buffer to protect Grasso who still carries shrapnel in his head and neck.

Grasso never saw DuBose again. He never knew what had happened to the man with whom he shared a 6-foot-deep foxhole night after night shivering in the cold and darkness because any fires would draw enemy gunfire.

“After I got wounded I said to myself ‘He never made it’ ” Grasso recalled at his ranch home in Norwood. “Who do you contact? You bury a guy and that’s the end of it.”

The trail to DuBose was uncovered by Joseph Pereira a former reporter and college journalism teacher who co-authored a book “All Souls Day” about the decades-long search for the remains of many US soldiers who died in Hürtgen Forest and seemed to have disappeared.

Grasso who is featured in the book told Pereira last fall that he wanted to visit DuBose’s grave. The search began and Pereira discovered 63 cemetery plots for men named Frank DuBose in South Carolina.

A former investigative reporter for The Wall Street Journal Pereira began calling each of the cemeteries.

In March he finally connected Grasso’s lieutenant to Camden. DuBose is a common name in this part of South Carolina about 30 miles from the capital of Columbia but no living relatives could be found for the veteran who was married without children.

On Friday Pereira watched Grasso from the edge of about 100 people who attended the ceremony a mix of Grasso family members and friends local and state officials and veterans groups.

“There was a wound in his soul. The wound that lingered up until this very weekend was the pain and the guilt of being a survivor” Pereira said. “But I see the healing continuing to this day this hour. I see this taking a huge burden off his shoulders.”

A GoFundMe effort led by a Quincy trio — Gayle Bellotti Uncle Sam Rounseville and his wife Jean Kenney — helped raise $7500 to bring Grasso family members and his caregiver Jill Drummey Foley to Camden.

They were greeted at the cemetery by Julian Burns who is the Kershaw County chairman and William Grimsley state secretary for veterans’ affairs. Both are retired Army major generals and both thanked Grasso for the sacrifice he made in war and for the comradeship that lingers 76 years after the battle that scarred him for life.

“We talk all the time about why people who join the service stay in the service” Grimsley said before the ceremony. “In the end it’s about the people who serve with you.”

Grasso still feels that connection. It showed in the salute he gave DuBose in his tears when he accepted a framed photograph of the lieutenant and in his words before a lunch of barbecue pork and banana pudding at the local American Legion post.

He’ll never forget his first trip to the Last Frontier State.

Jarboe had a 90-point ride on Outlaw Buckers Rodeo’s Brahma Boots Chrome to win the title at the Northernmost Xtreme Bull Riding in America in Palmer Alaska Saturday night.

“I had seen that bull a lot and I never had been on him and I really really wanted to get on him and I was glad to draw him here” Jarboe said. “Normally that bull is a couple rounds around to the right and about six seconds he will go back left. Today he stayed in it and he was around the right the whole time into my hand and it paid off. He is a good bull who turned his head and did his deal.

“I knew when I made the whistle I would be near the top and I was thrilled to hear my score.”

Stetson Wright the reigning two-time all-around world champion and reigning bull riding champ had a 90-point ride on Brahma Boots Chrome to place second in Round 5 of the 2020 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo at Globe Life Field in Arlington Texas.

Jarboe earned $5300 for his performance and a commemorative firearm. He just missed out on receiving five ounces of gold at the event which was 40 miles northeast of Anchorage.

“I had to ride the bounty bull (after the performance) to get the gold and I got bucked off in about three seconds but it didn’t take away from the excitement of winning and coming to Alaska for the first time” said Jarboe 28. “We were originally going to come up May 25 and hang out but we couldn’t make that happen. We just got in the night of (May 28) and we slept and came here. This trip is something that will carry on with me for a long time. The scenery here is awesome.”

Jarboe a native of New Plymouth Idaho was eighth in the May 25 PRCA | RAM World Standings with $38299 and was glad to get a boost as the summer run gets ready to kick into high gear.

“This check from Palmer was well-needed” he said. “I have been climbing up the standings a little bit here and there and hopefully this will help me continue that. As always my goal is to get to the Finals.”

Jarboe qualified for the NFR in 2016-18 and 2020. He finished sixth in the world standings a year ago.

“I have to keep working to get back there” Jarboe said. “We will fly home (May 30) and sleep and then we will get back on the road and drive 24 hours to Fort Smith (Ark.). I am up June 2 there. Rodeo is opening back up and it feels good that we have more rodeos to go to.”

Last summer when the shock of racial injustice was brought to the world’s attention I found my own unique perspective in high demand.

As someone of mixed race I am used to being asked to speak on panels about the experiences of being Black and Indigenous in Canada. This time I felt more of a responsibility to be a part of these conversations drafting statements of solidarity and presenting a united front of Black and Indigenous people.

Sometimes I felt as though I were being positioned as a spokesperson for this particular biracial identity which could be uncomfortable because I really only can speak for myself.

I also had my own questions as I felt that there was something missing throughout these particular conversations.

I grew up where being Black or Indigenous was the minority. Being Black and Indigenous even more so. I have grappled with how to be a part of both of my cultures throughout most of life.

To be Black and Indigenous is to be part of a beautiful relationship but one not without complexity.

It is sometimes tainted by a history of racism that has made us believe that we must fight for power between ourselves because there isn’t enough to go around.

The discussions of the past year have made me reflect on the issue more and I now find myself wondering: How do we push past these underlying tensions of colonial harm and positively redefine our relationships with each other -- and with Canada?

Last June I attended a Black Lives Matter protest in London Ont. that saw nearly 10000 supporters of all ages abilities and colour. I watched as people took a knee and vowed to change and to recognize and stand up for racial justice. I saw solidarity from all people including the Indigenous community. As people marched I could see the flag of the Mohawk Warrior Society amongst the crowds.

The protest intersected with stories of police brutality toward Indigenous peoples. Last March Chief Allan Adam of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation in northern Alberta was assaulted by an RCMP officer; a few months after that Chantel Moore was shot dead by police in New Brunswick during what was supposed to be a wellness check. These stories and all the others told since or told again are evidence of a truth that many Canadians choose to ignore: that racism happens in Canada too.

George Floyd’s story was not a new one to me. Neither was Chief Adam’s story. Rather this is the continuing story of what happens to people of colour and disproportionately Black and Indigenous people when they are seen as a threat or even a liability in Canada. Indeed at the same time as Mr. Floyd’s killer was facing trial for murder charges in Minneapolis a police officer in the same city shot Daunte Wright to death during a traffic stop – the officer stopped him for having an expired registration and an air freshener hanging from the car’s rearview mirror in violation of state law. One year after Mr. Floyd’s murder we are still seeing the ramifications of the broken promises and gestures of solidarity to Black Lives Matter.

The Canadian media has presented images like that of the Mohawk Warrior Flag at George Floyd protests as a symbol of Indigenous and Black solidarity across Canada. But this image is too simplistic. When we take Indigenous and Black solidarity for granted we diminish the particularities of Indigenous lives versus Black lives which are sometimes quite different and we diminish the power and significance of the gesture of solidarity.

I couldn’t help but feel as if Canadians did not quite understand the sometimes difficult history and complexity of the relationship – and the lessons they needed to learn from it.

My father is an African-American man from California. He met my mother a Blackfoot woman from the Kainai Blood Tribe of Southern Alberta in San Francisco where she was attending graduate school and the two of them moved to Lethbridge Alta. where my brother and I grew up. Because of the close connection to my mom’s family and community my brother and I were raised in many traditional Blackfoot ways by my mom and my grandmother. My connections to Black culture and community existed primarily through my dad and my dad’s family who live in the United States.

When I was growing up it often felt like it was “us or them” – Black people or Indigenous people – when it came to identity and community belonging or social and political justice. You could be Black or Indigenous but not both.

Here in Canada Indigenous and Black communities are effectively told that there is only “one seat at the table” as El Jones a community activist based out of Halifax says. This oppositional relationship has created a tension among us – fomenting the idea that we have to compete with each other when it comes to having Canadians recognize our rights our abilities and the importance of the issues we care about and fight for. This can manifest in feeling like supporting Black issues in Canada means that Indigenous people are obliged to put aside longstanding demands or that Black people might feel dishonoured if Indigenous people advocate for their own causes instead of those of others.

This unspoken tension exists between Indigenous and Black activism whether people want to acknowledge it or not. I felt it myself standing amid the vast crowd of supporters at the Black Lives Matter protest at the height of the pandemic. In contrast another protest in London in support of Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs’ land claim in March 2020 – before the pandemic even started – had only 200 people.

With the rise of the broad term “BIPOC” I can feel this tension growing even more not disappearing. The simplistic acronym groups Black Indigenous and other People Of Colour into a single and exclusionary category disadvantaging and separating us from those who identify as white or Caucasian. Canadians may treasure the symbol of a multicultural mosaic that makes up the fabric of Canada but it is harder to acknowledge that it is a facade.

The fact that widespread solidarity with Black Lives Matter has yet to mirror the same levels of support for Indigenous issues across Canada can be a source of resentment and this tension could potentially drive our communities apart if we let it – even though it is not the whole truth of Black and Indigenous relationships.

On a day-to-day local level not a lot of Indigenous and Black people have contact with each other in their everyday lives and large-scale movements are harder to organize across Canada’s huge expanse.

“Indigenous people on reserves have been fairly isolated politically and geographically and so they have little daily interaction with Black people” said Murray Sinclair a former Canadian senator and former chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This is changing however: In urban cities “the young politically and socially active Indigenous people and Black youth are more likely to be involved with each other in one way or another” Mr. Sinclair added. Yet a history of non-engagement makes it feel like “every time [Black and Indigenous solidarity] happens it’s like it’s the first time” says Andray Domise a community activist and writer.

Today’s solidarity then gathers strength in part from our long interwoven histories. When Europeans arrived on Indigenous lands they brought with them the African slave trade. African slaves and Indigenous nations formed connections through these early relationships. The Black Jamaican Maroons’ brief settlement in the Maritimes in the late 1700s linked Black and Indigenous communities hundreds of years ago. Slavery in Canada is not limited to Black slavery either. “Indigenous people were enslaved as far back as in the 1500s by North American traders and Catholic missionaries” Mr. Sinclair said. “… All of that stuff was hidden from history and is now being uncovered.”

We can also find solidarity in how our stories are taught twisted and omitted and how we have kept our stories alive.

In Canada our schools seem content to teach Black history in Canada through the slave trade and a heroic lens on our country’s contribution to the Underground Railroad as well as touching on Viola Desmond and the civil rights movement and leave it at that. Indigenous history never appears to intersect much with this history. But our connections extend beyond these stories and the legacies of these histories have left lasting effects on our communities.

Unequal education for instance existed in the form of segregated schools for Black children in Canada until the 1970s while the last Indian Residential Schools for Indigenous children didn’t finally close until 1996. These institutions did very similar work in creating a racial hierarchy in Canada. Not only were these children taught to think of themselves as inferior to white people but they were taught to look down on other ethnicities as well. Thus their relationship to each other was defined by seeing each other as less than.

My dad felt the effects of this himself. He is a man of few words so it is often difficult to learn the details of his life as a newcomer to Canada. More often than not he just said it was “different” back then.

I always remember my dad telling us how he was regularly confused with his neighbour one street over because they were two of the only Black men in Lethbridge in the 1980s. Or how we as a family could be walking in the mall when my dad would start exchanging small talk with another Black man and how when my brother and I asked how they knew each other he would reply that he was “just another Black man!” These stories always carried with them the sense of my dad’s humour making us laugh at the apparent absurdities in them.

As I got older though and as I delved deeper he told me there was no one way he felt welcomed or unwelcome in our small majority-white town. He simply got a mixed reception – one that he says depended on the lived experiences and biases of race held by the people he encountered. And these biases were frequently the result of a racist educational system.

He found that the perception of him within the Indigenous community changed when it became known that he was married to an Indigenous woman. The manner in which he was treated grew cooler sometimes but not every time. He also found a welcome in the community through a few respected Elders and members of my mom’s family. He was introduced to a number of elements of Blackfoot culture; he was even adopted and given a Blackfoot name. My dad blames the colder receptions on learned racism that were taught through years of a colonial education one that continues to dictate the institutions governing the lives of Indigenous and Black people in Canada today.

Mr. Sinclair acknowledges that residential schools caused Indigenous children to be “raised in a racist environment and that means not only racism towards them … but they were also raised to believe in racial stereotyping against Black people.” He added: “There are significant elements within the Indigenous community who have not yet been able to overcome that. That has led to misunderstandings and sometimes callous sorts of thinking of Black people.”

Nevertheless Indigenous and Black communities in Canada forged bonds over a shared struggle to be seen among white majorities as deserving of the same rights and opportunities in the face of over-representation in the criminal justice and child welfare systems. And these shared struggles have also been sources of community strength with political movements feeding off each other.

In the 1960s and 1970s the civil-rights movement inspired the Red Power Movement in the U.S. which drew on similar tactics to highlight inequality including a high-profile occupation of Alcatraz Prison. The political and civil activism by Indigenous people in Canada in the second half of the 20th century was inspired by these movements too. The Constitution Express was a massive grassroots movement of Indigenous people across Canada travelling to Ottawa to protest Indigenous rights in the repatriation of the Constitution in 1980 and 1981. This is the solidarity we are seeing reflected again now after Mr. Floyd’s death.

The past and present allyship signals a strong bond for future Black and Indigenous activism in Canada. Shawn Johnston and Amy Smoke organizers of O:se Kenhionhata:tie (Land Back Camp) in Kitchener Ont. acknowledge that their movement could not have existed without the support of the Black community: “Indigenous sovereignty and Black liberation are bound together our histories and rights and freedoms are intertwined here on these lands [Turtle Island]” Ms. Smoke says.

And while many Black activists see themselves as existing outside the settler concept owing to enslavement and forced migration “we are still guests on this land” Ms. Jones says. “If I am fighting our struggle on Indigenous territories then I must also understand and be in solidarity with Indigenous struggles against colonization. To imagine our freedom without first recognizing and fighting for Indigenous sovereignty is impossible. How could we be free while denying Indigenous self-determination?”

Acknowledging the extent to which settler-colonialism has affected Black and Indigenous communities is the first step toward a more just and shared future.

Perhaps the reckoning brought forth by Mr. Floyd’s death was the first step in acknowledging the extent to which settler-colonialism has affected Black and Indigenous communities; it could be a springboard for a more just and shared future. For former justice minister and current Vancouver Granville MP Jody Wilson-Raybould the tensions sown by colonialism are becoming “less pronounced” through recent activism. “The awareness [of each other’s lived experiences] is really good” she says adding that this solidarity “goes beyond Black and Indigenous communities – it is [recognizing that] some segments of the society do suffer more than others.”

Yet this recognition can only be one part of the solution. We must also address the ways that Canada’s institutions affect our beliefs prejudices and relationships with each other and do the work of dismantling them. Trust needs to be rebuilt with communities of colour whether it be through our public educational systems – the “vessel of colonialism” as Mr. Sinclair puts it – or our medical and justice systems. “Every institution in society” he says “needs to be considered anew.”

Addressing our institutional racism is part of what politicians are often quick to proclaim as the solution to the process of “reconciliation.” That word in Canada tends to have a very specific meaning involving the recognition of and healing from the history of harm against Indigenous people particularly in relation to Indian Residential Schools – but it is much more complex than that. For Ms. Jones the government’s definition of reconciliation is still an institutional one and as such it is a “surface practice” that “isn’t about actually rethinking power or decolonization.” Just as the government has promised to end boil-water advisories in the spirit of “reconciliation” but has failed to follow through Ms. Jones worries that a similar phenomenon will occur on the heels of “meaningless solidarity statements about Black Lives Matter.”

We need to adjust our understanding of reconciliation much in the same ways we are adjusting our internal and external education systems without as Ms. Jones refers to it the impositions of anti-Blackness and anti-Indigeneity. This may involve re-examining how we understand our relationships to one another in both personal and political spheres.

Where we go and what we do with this new education is the question we will all need to answer going forward. As racial injustices continue to come to light and as we as a country continue on with the process of reconciliation we will all need to decide how we will fit into this reformed society. A new era of activism is upon us and we may feel pressure to make our allegiances known loud and clear. But not every act of solidarity must exist on the front lines either. “Not everyone is an activist” Mr. Domise says.

It’s a reassuring idea to me. I’ve found myself intimidated by the widespread notion that fighting against social injustice means marching in protests and loudly denouncing it everywhere in your life. But by living and understanding our shared history we can also pursue justice in other ways: through academia through media and art through meaningful conversations with our friends and families but most importantly by speaking up with the truth when it matters most.

While I have never felt deeply compelled to join marches and carry picket signs I have a growing clear-eyed understanding of the tension that’s been inflicted on our communities – one that has tried to teach us that we are less than and less than each other – and from that an understanding of how to build relationships between communities. That doesn’t make me any less of an advocate. Just as my parents never settled for anyone’s judgments or mistreatments toward them or others finding ways to share our experiences and stand up for the truth when it matters can make deeper impacts on those around us – sometimes more than we realize.

In this past year whether it be from the global pandemic or the uprising in social and racial justice the relationships we have with one another are becoming increasingly more important. What bonds us together is more important than what sets us apart. This solidarity has existed between Black and Indigenous communities since we first became connected with one another and it finds strength when we have been willing to learn from each other’s experiences. The question will be if the rest of the world is ready to learn these lessons as well."

According to Walter Isaacson’s biography of Jobs Powell Jobs got dragged along to a campus event by a friend. It turned out to be a guest lecture by Jobs.

“I knew that Steve Jobs was the speaker but the face I thought of was that of Bill Gates” Powell Jobs told Isaacson. “I had them mixed up.”

“This was 1989” Powell Jobs added. “He was working at Next and he was not that big of a deal to me. I wasn’t that enthused but my friend was so we went.”

The pair arrived late and were told they couldn’t just sit in the aisle. Powell Jobs and her friend ended up sneaking into the reserved seats at the front of the hall.

Jobs ended up sitting next to his future wife: “I looked to my right and there was a beautiful girl there so we started chatting while I was waiting to be introduced” he said.

Powell Jobs joked that she was sitting up front because she’d won a raffle and the prize included a dinner with Jobs.

Jobs finished his lecture and chased after his future wife who had already walked out of the hall. He found Powell Jobs in the car park and asked her about the raffle. She agreed to go to dinner with him that Saturday and they exchanged numbers.

But apparently the weekend wasn’t soon enough: Jobs prepared to leave for a work dinner but returned to Powell Jobs. Changing his mind he asked if she’d like to go to dinner that night instead. She agreed and they headed to a nearby restaurant called Saint Michael’s Alley.

While Jobs’ Next colleagues waited for their boss to show up the tech founder and Powell Jobs spent four hours at the restaurant and remained together afterwards that night.

They married in March 1991 at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park. The couple had three children: Reed Erin and Eve. Eve Jobs 23 began modelling for the beauty brand Glossier in late 2020.

When Jobs died from cancer in 2011 his wife inherited his wealth including stakes in Apple and The Walt Disney Company. The inheritance left Powell Jobs a billionaire.

Her stake in Disney initially made her the company’s largest individual shareholder but in 2017 she reduced her ownership to 4 per cent.

Powell Jobs spends a lot of her fortune on philanthropy and Forbes named her the 29th most powerful woman in the world in 2014.

She told The New York Times in 2013 that she isn’t interested in passing her fortune down to her kids. “If I live long enough it ends with me” she said. “In the broadest sense we want to use our knowledge and our network and our relationships to try to effect the greatest amount of good.”

In 1992 she founded a health-food truck called Terravera with fellow Stanford MBA graduate John Mullane.

The pair sold basmati rice platters and burritos with black bean dressing to white-collar workers in office parks. “We just wanted to offer a convenient way for them to eat healthy food” Powell Jobs told the Chicago Tribune in 1992.

She later backed away from Terravera to focus on her volunteer work tutoring underprivileged students in East Palo Alto.

In 1997 Powell Jobs founded College Track a non-profit organisation that helps prepare low-income students for college through tutoring and mentoring. College Track now operates centers in three states and the District of Columbia.

Powell Jobs founded Emerson Collective in 2004 a “social change organisation” named after one of her favourite writers Ralph Waldo Emerson.

The Emerson Collective is a private company rather than a traditional non-profit and makes grants and investments that focus on immigration social justice and education. It has funded several start-ups. The Washington Post described it as a “kind of Justice League of practical progressives”.

Emerson Collective projects include AltSchool a venture-capital-backed school that aimed to transform education by personalising instruction with technology. AltSchool made disappointing revenues and handed over control of its four schools to another start-up in 2019.

In September 2015 Powell Jobs pledged US$50 million via Emerson to fund a campaign called XQ: The Super School Project. That venture aims to transform education by revamping how high schools approach curriculum. Powell Jobs is the chairwoman of XQ’s board of directors.

Powell Jobs has also served on the board of several other organizations including Teach for America Conservation International and the New America Foundation.

She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and Stanford University’s board of trustees. Along with Michael Bloomberg and Ray Dalio Powell Jobs is a founding member of the Climate Leadership Council.

In addition to her work with various causes Powell Jobs has a reputation as a major art collector and enthusiast. She attended the “Manus X Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology” Met Gala in 2016 alongside Apple CEO Tim Cook.

She’s also a big sports fan. She bought a 20 per cent stake in the company that owns the NBA’s Washington Wizards the NHL’s Washington Capitals and Washington’s Capital One Arena in October 2018.

In July 2017 Emerson Collective acquired a majority stake in The Atlantic which was forced to lay off 17 per cent of its staff during the pandemic.

Powell Jobs commended the magazine for its drive to “bring about equality for all people; to illuminate and defend the American idea; to celebrate American culture and literature; and to cover our marvellous messy democratic experiment”.

Former president Donald Trump lashed out at Powell Jobs in the fall of 2020 over a report from The Atlantic that alleged he called WWI soldiers “WWlosers”. He tweeted “Steve Jobs would not be happy that his wife is wasting money he left her on a flailing radical left magazine.”

Powell Jobs has also put millions of dollars into political campaigns. She backed Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign before the California senator withdrew from the race in December 2019.

Powell Jobs backed secretary Hillary Clinton in 2016 donating US$2 million to Clinton’s Super PAC through Emerson Collective and hosting US$200000-a-plate fundraiser that raised over US$4 million CNN reported.

When it comes to property Powell Jobs owns a US$16.5 million home in San Francisco that boasts six bedrooms six and a half bathrooms and incredible views of the city.

Powell Jobs owns three other homes in the Bay Area including a 5770 sq ft house she shared with her late husband.

She puts on elaborate Halloween shows in front of that house each year that attract as many as 3000 people. In 2019 the event was called Fog Town and featured a jack-o’-lantern tower and professional lighting actors and special effects.

Despite her luxurious lifestyle and widespread influence Powell Jobs tries to keep a low profile.

“I’m very aware of the fact that we’re all just passing through here” Powell Jobs told The Washington Post in 2018. “I feel like I’m hitting my stride now. It is my goal to effectively deploy resources. If there’s nothing left when I die that’s just fine.”

Powell Jobs recently delivered a commencement speech to the University of Pennsylvania’s graduating class of 2021 and advised the students to follow her late husband’s advice to find work in what they love to do.

“Let his words guide you as they’ve guided me” Powell Jobs said in the speech in May according to CNBC.

Standing still and silent leaning forward and softly lifting a leg in the air the savannah elephants of Namibia use their highly sensitive feet to detect seismic vibrations and low-frequency rumbles from many kilometres away: distress calls predator alarms navigation signals.

Soon the elephants could be sensing a strange new vibration. If permission is granted a junior Canadian oil company will deploy its seismic tractors to survey hundreds of kilometres of these African plains for what might be one of the world’s biggest new oil developments – and possibly its last virgin oil play.

The project still in its exploration drilling phase has become a global cause célèbre with Namibia’s endangered elephants at the heart of it.

This sparsely populated corner of Southern Africa is now a battleground between a Calgary-based company and an informal coalition of environmentalists Hollywood celebrities Indigenous activists wildlife conservationists and Anglican bishops.

Critics warn the oil development could damage a sensitive environment threaten Indigenous culture and jeopardize the rivers of a watershed area that leads into the fabled Okavango Delta and its vast gatherings of wildlife.

The company Reconnaissance Energy Africa Ltd. (ReconAfrica) rejects these allegations. And it is far from powerless in this clash. An investigation by The Globe and Mail found the company’s leaders have forged relationships with the Namibian government and with a politically connected businessman in Namibia.

Until late last year the company faced little public scrutiny obtaining its exploration licence with few people noticing. But the battle is heating up with angry protests and petitions. And the herds of elephants marching across dusty Namibia to their great havens near the Okavango in northern Botswana are one of the fiercest points of dispute.

When the giant animals sense the noise of the oil drilling and seismic activity will their migration be dangerously disrupted throwing an endangered species into deeper peril? Or are the elephants too far away and too few to worry about as the company has insisted?

Beyond the fury of the environmental skirmishes another global issue is looming. In an era of worsening climate change should Namibia listen to groups such as the International Energy Agency and consider cancelling the project entirely? Is this the last gasp of a fading industry? Or is it Namibia’s best hope for escaping poverty and generating desperately needed jobs and energy as its proponents argue?

ReconAfrica’s exploration licences cover a massive territory: about 35000 square kilometres of the Kavango Basin in northeastern Namibia and northwestern Botswana. The area is adjacent to the Khaudum and Bwabwata national parks and two UNESCO world heritage sites – the Okavango Delta which attracts one of Africa’s greatest concentrations of wildlife and Tsodilo Hills which contains more than 4500 rock paintings and other sites from thousands of years of human habitation.

Elephants African wild dogs lions cheetahs and zebras roam the rolling grasslands and desert of this region. How much oil is buried beneath them is more nebulous. ReconAfrica acknowledges there’s some conjecture around the figure but its geochemist Daniel Jarvie estimates between 60 billion and 120 billion barrels.

Serendipity played a large role in the company securing what it believes to be the world’s last untapped sedimentary basin.

Its Canadian co-founders Craig Steinke and Jay Park have known each other for more than a decade working together on projects around the world. For years Mr. Steinke has also worked alongside Mr. Jarvie drilling engineer Nick Steinsberger and with ReconAfrica chief executive officer Scot Evans when Mr. Evans was at Halliburton Co.

During a recent interview from his B.C. home Mr. Steinke told The Globe how in 2013 he landed a worldwide dataset of potential undeveloped oil and gas plays. One of those was in the Kavango region. An old well drilled in 1964 gave him a geological hunch that oil was about so he leased land in the area.

In 2014 in conversation with officials at Namibia’s Ministry of Mines and Energy Mr. Steinke discovered the government had flown a magnetic survey over the lands he was leasing. Was he interested in buying it? He was. He did. And he sent the data to colleagues in Houston. “The interpretation came back very positive in that there was a big deep sedimentary basin here that nobody knew was there” he says. “So I consummated the leasing of the lands in early 2014 and that’s how one little company wound up with an entire sedimentary basin.”

Despite some offshore exploration Namibia is far from a traditional oil hot spot. That has resulted in myriad challenges for ReconAfrica the largest of which was the lack of drilling rigs in the country. In summer 2019 when the company tried to find contractors who could drill the three wells contracted under its agreement with the Namibian government it discovered there were no land rigs in the vicinity.

“It didn’t take long to realize we could actually buy our own rig drill these three wells and own the rig at the end of the day for about half the cost that these drilling contractors were quoting us” Mr. Steinke says.

The solution? Buy a rig in Texas refurbish it for use in the desert climate sail it to Namibia on a 600-foot-long transport ship called the Yellowstone and truck it inland to ReconAfrica’s drilling lease. After pandemic-related delays the rig landed in December 2020.

In January ReconAfrica drilled its first well. On May 5 it announced its second.

Under its partnership contract with the Namibian government and state-owned oil company NAMCOR ReconAfrica will drill three wells and establish whether there’s an active petroleum system.

At first blush it looks promising. The company has already found light oil and natural gas with a high energy content. “Fantastic” Mr. Steinke says “but it’s a long process to deeming the play commercial.”

While the technical obstacles have been significant the company always had one big advantage: its strong relationship with the Namibian government which has been eagerly hoping to build an oil industry and generate new revenue sources for the country of fewer than three million people traditionally reliant on tourism and mining.

“It was very important to find the governments that needed Indigenous sources of energy and would be very supportive of ReconAfrica’s efforts” Mr. Steinke says. “They had a very good modern petroleum regime and great fiscal terms.”

Mr. Park an oil and gas lawyer who for years was based in Calgary and is now ReconAfrica’s chair has been central to the company’s efforts to develop close relations with the Namibian Energy Ministry. “He’s done a wonderful job ingratiating the company with the ministry” Mr. Steinke said in an online presentation to investors last year.

This indeed is an area of expertise for Mr. Park who has long experience in 17 African countries and is now based in London. But critics say his relationships with African governments have occasionally been questionable. They point to a report by a United Nations monitoring group in 2015 that alleged a conflict of interest in Mr. Park’s role as a legal adviser at Somalia’s Petroleum Ministry.

In 2013 the Somali ministry had awarded a dozen offshore oil and gas blocks – totalling 60000 square kilometres – to a small British company Soma Oil & Gas which had been incorporated only a few months earlier. The British company later paid more than US$494000 to Mr. Park’s firm for the legal services he provided to the ministry during the negotiations for the deal according to the report by the UN Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea.

The monitoring group cited a report by a ministry legal adviser who said the government might not have received proper legal representation in the negotiations because Mr. Park had a conflict of interest.

Mr. Park denies any impropriety. He says the Somali government asked the British company to pay his legal fees after the oil deal negotiations were concluded and he describes this as a common arrangement.

In the same report the UN group said Mr. Park had been involved in an earlier incident in 2011 in which his team of lawyers helped transfer a US$2-million payment from Calgary-based Griffiths Energy International Inc. to a company owned by the wife of the ambassador of Chad a notoriously corrupt African country where Griffiths was seeking oil and gas rights. The payment led to a bribery investigation by the RCMP and Griffiths eventually agreed to pay a fine of more than $10-million.

This week U.S. authorities announced they had filed criminal charges against two former Chadian diplomats and a co-founder of Griffiths in connection with the bribery scheme. The company’s co-founder Naeem Tyab has pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit US$27-million in criminal proceeds the U.S. Justice Department said.

Mr. Park says his team inquired at the time of the US$2-million payment whether it was going to government officials and was assured it was not. He says the company later discovered the connection to the ambassador’s wife and he helped the company to self-investigate and voluntarily disclose the payment to the RCMP.

In Mr. Park’s latest venture analysts have pointed to a different kind of connection between the oil company and the government. ReconAfrica has confirmed that last year it retained the services of a controversial Namibian businessman Knowledge Katti who has been the frequent subject of local media reports for his close links to senior Namibian officials including President Hage Geingob.

In an interview with The Globe Mr. Park initially said ReconAfrica had no involvement with Mr. Katti. But a company spokesperson later said Mr. Katti was “briefly engaged as a media relations consultant for ReconAfrica in Namibia starting in October 2020” and no longer has any business relationship with the company.

Mr. Katti according to many reports in media outlets over the past decade in Namibia and South Africa is a friend of Mr. Geingob. He has often travelled abroad with the President sometimes as a member of official delegations and has even paid for some of Mr. Geingob’s medical bills.

He has a long history of involvement as a middleman in mining and energy deals in Namibia often with Canadian companies or other foreign investors. In leaked e-mails in 2017 he spoke of his political influence and his “inside contacts” in the government and promised to “work the magic” on behalf of a business partner according to media reports.

“It’s a matter of great concern if someone with close links to the President is also connected to a company that is involved in highly controversial and potentially damaging extractive activities” says Graham Hopwood executive director of the Institute for Public Policy Research in the Namibian capital Windhoek.

“We need Namibian institutions to remain scrupulously independent as the activities and plans of ReconAfrica are monitored and assessed” he told The Globe. “The allocation of petroleum exploration licences in Namibia has been mired in controversy for years with very little transparency about who is benefiting. The granting of such licences needs to be opened up to public scrutiny and the involvement of politically connected persons ruled out.”

Annette Hubschle a senior research fellow at the University of Cape Town and a member of a Namibian environmental group says she’s concerned by the role of Mr. Park and Mr. Katti in the ReconAfrica development because of their involvement in questionable earlier deals. It’s part of a larger pattern in Southern Africa she says. “Oil explorations across the region have been mired in environmental political and social scandals with long-term devastation for local and Indigenous communities.”

The impact on those communities is the subject of heated debate. James Suzman was the first social anthropologist to work in Namibia’s eastern Omaheke region – on the southern edge of where ReconAfrica is tapping for oil – and has written extensively on the San Indigenous people who live there. He also helped develop local consultation processes for diamond mining giant De Beers in next-door Botswana.

What worries him about the ReconAfrica project is the lack of full consultation with local communities. Consultations require community meetings he says. They require scale complexity long and careful checklists. “The process of getting prior and informed consent is not about sticking out pamphlets and holding a few bloody community meetings” Mr. Suzman said in a recent interview from Britain. “You record everything do everything you go back and forth. It requires above all time.”

ReconAfrica’s Mr. Steinke counters his company has gone over and above what’s required. A Namibian team has translated pamphlets about the project into local languages and dropped them off to rural villages. The company has taken out radio and newspaper ads. It has drilled community water wells.

He argues this has resulted in broad support for the operation but acknowledges there’s always room to expand stakeholder relations.

For Mr. Suzman though the fact local communities tend to be politically marginalized has opened up the very real possibility of the Namibian government “steamrolling through.”

As global awareness of the project grows so does opposition to it. The Okavango Delta is world-famous not just among environmentalists but also among ecotourists and travellers.

Locally a farmer has taken the company to court over land issues and more than 30 Southern African Anglican bishops recently labelled the project a sin. Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio has criticized ReconAfrica’s plan Canadian environmentalist groups are demanding officials here hold the company accountable for what they deem ecologically questionable activities and the UNESCO World Heritage Centre has voiced concern about the oil development’s potential impact on the heritage sites.

Mr. Steinke dismisses those objections. “It’s easy to criticize” an oil project on another continent when you live in the developed world he says where the lights flick on at the touch of a switch and clean water is a simple matter of turning a tap.

Darias Jonker who monitors Southern Africa for the Eurasia Group a political risk consultancy firm agrees that opposition to the project is comparably light on the ground in Namibia but says it’s nothing to do with apathy. Rather he says it’s that the project is in a sparsely populated region combined with the fact there’s no strong political opposition in the country.

“There aren’t too many communities directly affected by this and this is also one of the reasons why the initial stages of the project managed to slip by relatively unnoticed. But now there’s this rapidly escalating opposition to these plans because they do threaten the very fragile ecosystem” he says.

He thinks it also helps the project is still in its exploration stages although that may change if ReconAfrica finds the proof it wants to ramp up operations into commercial production – a prospect Mr. Park says he’s “very bullish about.”

The elephants are one of the most crucial issues in the environmental battle. If the company gets approval it will move ahead with seismic testing for 40 days over a 450-kilometre stretch of territory largely on public roads using a tractor-sized vehicle. ReconAfrica says the seismic survey will not interfere with wildlife communication or migratory movements and will be monitored by a wildlife expert on the company’s staff. The elephant migration route at the southern end of its exploration area will be a no-go zone Mr. Steinke says.

But environmentalists are skeptical. Elephants don’t necessarily walk in clearly defined paths they say. When an oil company operated near a national park in Uganda elephants moved up to eight kilometres away from the seismic activity and shifted to nocturnal activity to avoid the daytime operations according to scientific studies.

“Until absolutely proven to not harm savannah elephants the seismic activity should be halted” the environmental group Frack Free Namibia and Botswana said in a 14-page submission to Namibia’s environmental commissioner.

If ReconAfrica wants to begin production Mr. Jonker expects opposition to grow and quickly. Court challenges international pressure through diplomatic and financing channels environmental lobbying – “they certainly are not going down without a fight.”

Earlier this year ReconAfrica made the 2021 TSX Venture 50 a ranking of the top performers on the exchange selected based on their ability to access capital for growth and scale up their business. But in an early example of the international lobbying U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy this week called for “prompt and thorough scrutiny” of the Namibia project by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Earlier this month a 44-page complaint was filed at the SEC alleging ReconAfrica may have misled investors in press releases and other promotional material. More than 150 promotional items about the company have been disseminated by ReconAfrica and third-party promoters since 2019 often containing misleading information or failing to disclose the compensation paid to the publishers or their financial interest in the company’s stock according to the SEC complaint which was provided to The Globe with the complainant’s name kept confidential.

A check by The Globe showed ReconAfrica has been the focus of numerous glowing articles on oilprice.com over the past eight months. Each is by a different author with no other online presence and only a single byline on the website.

The company says it has been transparent and legal in all of its finances and the SEC complaint is an unproven allegation. “Anyone can file a complaint with the SEC” it says. “There are no standards or requirements for accuracy or truth for these filings.”

Neil Brown a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Centre says he believes there’s a possibility of a “significant backlash” against the company – not only because of international activism against drilling near one of the most important wildlife habitats in Africa but also because of concerns that ReconAfrica is not taking sufficient environmental precautions to protect drinking water in a country that “has essentially no enforcement capabilities.”

Namibia’s Minister of Agriculture Water and Land Reform Calle Schlettwein said publicly this week his ministry has not yet issued permits to the company for the water boreholes it has been drilling. The company responded by saying it has the “necessary consent” from the traditional authorities in the region.

Mr. Brown also points to the fact Namibia’s long history of mining doesn’t translate into a framework to manage oil resources. Nor is the country a participant in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative the basic global standard followed by 55 countries for transparency and good governance in oil gas and mining. Oil rushes he says “have a bad track record across much of sub-Saharan Africa in terms of promoting corruption distorting the economy perpetuating inequality locally and failing to meet expectations of economic development.”

Mr. Park of ReconAfrica acknowledges Namibia’s onshore oil regulations will require further work particularly around rules that govern the abandonment of wells. Still he says the company’s development plan will address how abandonment is done properly and funded adequately.

But why Africa? And why now? After all the International Energy Agency’s most recent report released May 18 pulled no punches: Fossil fuels should play a virtually non-existent role in a world striving to meet its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.

The Paris-based agency recommends an immediate halt to investment in all new oil gas and coal projects. Limiting the worst effects of climate change will require a huge decline in the use of fossil fuels it says falling from almost four-fifths of total energy supply today to slightly more than one-fifth by 2050. For oil specifically it says the lion’s share of supply will likely come from OPEC countries. (Namibia is not an OPEC member.)

That leads to the question of why a massive virgin oil play in Southern Africa would be developed at all.

“It is difficult to begrudge a poor country from wanting to develop” Mr. Jonker says. But he says the project’s cost-benefit calculation needs “a lot of scrutiny.”

At ReconAfrica Mr. Steinke acknowledges the world is undergoing an energy renaissance but says governments have to get real about how to meet targets for cleaner energy. As it stands he says the timeline politicians have set out for energy technology is “fanciful thinking.”

Namibia is better placed financially than some of its neighbours but it remains relatively poor and there are few economic drawcards save for tourism fishing and mining (mostly diamonds). That leaves the country thirsty for revenue options and the potential royalties geyser from a giant oil reserve is an attractive proposition.

Under a roadmap set out by former president Sam Nujoma in 2004 Namibia plans to become “a prosperous and industrialized nation” by 2030. The country detailed a host of lofty goals including processing natural resources and building industries in all sectors of the economy.

“How do you even have another industry if you don’t have energy?” Mr. Steinke asks. “It can’t be done. This area needs help.”

ReconAfrica employs about 200 Namibians comprising around 80 per cent of its work force. Half of those are locals from the region surrounding the project. But Mr. Suzman argues the oil project isn’t particularly labour-intensive. “I can’t imagine any project like this generating considerable local value in any substantive way shape or form” he says.

ReconAfrica takes a different view. Mr. Steinke says if critics spent time in Namibia to understand generational poverty in the Kavango they would walk away with a different attitude.

“ReconAfrica is not here to flip the property” he says. “That’s not our intention. We’re here for the long term.”

The Globe is for obvious reasons one of the best ventilated theatres in London but full social-distancing measures are in place and the cast reminds us that if evenings like this are to remain possible we must keep our masks on. Proceedings open with the audience being riotously serenaded by rainbow-hued brass band before the stage is cleared so that nothing is on it but a box marked ‘Fragile’.

From the moment that Victoria Elliott’s warrior-queen Hippolyta blasts out of the box complete with breastplate we are left in no doubt of the contempt she has for Peter Bourke’s Theseus. The opening scene of A Midsummer Night’s Dream is after all a disturbing one. Not only does it show Hermia threatened with the death-sentence for refusing to marry Demetrius but the text strongly implies that Theseus abused Hippolyta when he defeated her in battle. So while she is not fragile she is trapped; and Bourke’s Latin-American dictator-style garb puts this in context as much as the lovers’ decision to flee his influence by going to the woods.

Yet this is overall a production that revels in the joyously absurd much as it hints at the play’s darker edges. Both Elliott and Bourke return from the 2019 production to double up as Hippolyta/Theseus and Titania/Oberon and Elliott in particular seems to be having a ball as she emerges into the woods on a pink scooter in silver high-heeled boots as Titania. It’s a scene-stealing turn especially combined with her comic timing and singing. Though she is more than matched by Sophie Russell who replaces Jocelyn Jee Esien as the verbally-incontinent Bottom strikingly clad in a metallic red jacket and glimmering leopard-print trousers before being transformed into a carnivalesque donkey.

In contrast to the rainbow-explosion of the rest of the cast the lovers are dressed in black and white - the aesthetic a mash-up of Tudor and modern streetwear with ruffs emerging like body armour from shoulders and backs and boots-with-attitude. Only the charismatic Ciarán O’Brien returns from 2019 as Demetrius – Nadi Kemp-Sayfi is a savvy and compelling Hermia; Bryan Dick is an appealingly bolshy Lysander; and Shona Babayemi exudes both power and pathos as Helena.

It’s one of the great innovations of this production that Puck appears as a flash-mob with several members of the cast doubling up to help wreak anarchy - this is deployed to particularly good comedic effect at the play's conclusion as the different Pucks compete to deliver the final words. The rude mechanicals remain a highlight with Nadine Higgin’s blue-tressed disco-leader Peter Quince (pictured top) ably heading up the revelries whether she’s leading rehearsals or stirring up the audience to sing ‘Caravan of Love’. In this diverting crowd Rachel Hannah Clarke in particular makes her mark as a comedically timid Snug who starts out as a cowardly lion but suddenly finds her roar once the spotlight is on her.

Most overwhelmingly though this is a production that shows that life as we once knew it might be possible again. Jean Chan’s riotous design all hallucinogenic forest creepers and wild party costumes is a tonic from the start.

But the lottery which will control the location of 15 sports betting venues in Connecticut under the new sports and online gambling law said it expects to first look to smaller locations in the Hartford area to offer sports gambling sooner to the betting public. Legislative leaders say the first betting could begin as early as the start of the NFL season on Sept. 9.

Rob Simmelkjaer chairman of the lottery’s board and former executive at ESPN and NBCSports said sports betting at the XL Center would be part of a larger venue. Gambling would be combined with dining bars and other entertainment options possibly including esports video-based gaming in which participants compete against one another Simmelkjaer said.

A sports betting venue in Hartford’s XL Center could become part of a new club area shown here in a rendering from last year.

“That’s going to be a plan that is going to involve significant investment development — possibly construction — so it’s going to be a bit of a longer term play” Simmelkjaer said. “Therefore we may look to have some short-term locations so we can get to market quickly.”

If the XL Center becomes one of Connecticut’s larger sports betting venues it isn’t likely to become a fully built venue until the start of the 2022 NFL season at the earliest. But portions could be phased in before that Simmelkjaer said.

Last week Gov. Ned Lamont signed into law a sweeping expansion of legalized gambling in Connecticut. In addition to creating sports betting venues in 15 locations the law allows the lottery to run online gambling and the state’s tribal casinos to operate sports betting and online gambling.

A sports betting venue or “sportsbook” typically has banks of large-screen televisions with boards displaying betting odds and can be combined with options for just watching games and access to food and beverages.

While legislators this spring debated the largest expansion of legalized gambling in Connecticut in decades Simmelkjaer and Connecticut Lottery chief executive Greg Smith in recent weeks were touring both the XL Center and smaller Hartford-area sites that could be ramped up more swiftly.

Those other sites are now operated by Sportech which is licensed to offer off-track betting in Connecticut. Sportech could be sublicensed to accommodate sports betting.

With XL Center temporarily closed for events due to the COVID-19 pandemic the Capital Region Development Authority started moving ahead with some renovations at the arena.

Locations include Winners on Brainard Road in Hartford Shea’s Pizzeria and Sports Bar in Manchester Bobby V’s near Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks — and there could be others Simmelkjaer said.

Simmelkjaer said the focus on placing one of the state’s two larger sports betting sites at the XL Center came from the governor.

“The governor has made it clear that he is looking to do something big there and wants to find a way to have sports betting help the development of that location a part of a development progress plan for the XL Center” Simmelkjaer said.

The area of these locker rooms and other “back of the house” spaces at Hartford’s XL Center could become part of a sports betting venue.

The future of the 46-year-old arena has been debated for more than a decade. The Capital Region Development Authority which oversees the XL Center downsized a $250 million renovation of the arena to about $100 million with the focus on premium seating and more amenities in the lower half of the arena to boost profitability.

Opponents have argued the state should not be in the business of running a money-losing arena and pouring more state taxpayer-back dollars into it. Some have said the arena should be razed and redeveloped.

While the shape size and cost of adding a sports betting component to the XL Center is still unclear CRDA executive director Michael Freimuth said there are alternatives for adding a sports betting venue at the XL Center.

The XL Center’s atrium at the arena’s Trumbull Street entrance also is a space that could be used for sports betting. The area however is privately owned by Northland Investment Corp in Newton Mass. The Capital Region Development Authority’s efforts to purchase the space have been unsuccessful for years.

Freimuth said options include lower-level suites the exhibition hall “back of house” areas already targeted for conversion into space for fans and other visitors and the atrium off Trumbull Street. The atrium is owned by Northland Investment Corp. and CRDA has been unable for years to reach an agreement to acquire the space.

“So it has been viewed upon as complementary and been viewed as something we’d like to have in the facility” Freimuth said.

Simmelkjaer said the financing of sports betting at the XL Center could include private investors and the company that is chosen to run the locations to run the lottery-controlled sites might also help with financing.

The lottery drew proposals from 15 operators and four have been chosen to submit detailed plans within two weeks of Lamont signing the gambling expansion into law Simmelkjaer said.

The Trumbull Street entrance to Hartford’s XL Center. A sports betting venue at the arena could boost renovation efforts.

The addition of sports betting at the XL Center also could potentially help shake loose $65 million in state capital improvement funds for arena renovations. The legislature approved borrowing the funds but the State Bond Commission chaired by Lamont has yet to release them.

CRDA has already received $40 million in funds borrowed by the state about half of which has been spent on repairs partly for a push a few years ago to seek a private investor to take over the arena. The initiative drew little interest.

Legislative leaders including Speaker of the House Matt Ritter a Hartford Democrat who supports renovations at the XL Center have said a sports betting venue at the arena could help pay for some of the costs of renovating the XL Center.

“I am confident we will see a path forward” Ritter said. “It would be odd to be thinking about putting a large facility in something that you were going to knock down.”

As part of a larger venue sports betting make sense for a renovated XL Center and would benefit not only the city but the region — attracting more visitors to the city and infusing new life into arena Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin said.

“Unless we want to see a rusting hulk of steel and concrete in the center of the capital city for decades to come or we’re prepared to put hundreds of millions of dollars to demolish and subsidize redevelopment of the area it’s time and long past time to make the investment necessary to upgrade this facility and make it competitive again” Bronin said.

The releases proved to be near perfect to what Ghostbusters fans will remember from the 1980s so much so we got to thinking if it would be possible to modify the Ecto-1 into an Ecto-1A much like the original Kenner release from 1989.

After a quick search online we came across some reproduction sticker sheets featuring all the caution striping logos and psychomagnotheric mood slime; we needed to take the Ecto-1 and change it into the Ecto-1A!

Age of Apocalypse/Colossus BAF Wave

This isn’t the first Marvel Legends wave from this era/storyline but it’s definitely the stronger of the two. Since all of these are digital renderings however we’ll hold off doing a full figure-by-figure analysis.

If you’re comfortable ordering before seeing the real deal however each one will retail for $22.99 and can be preordered (assuming they haven’t sold out) by clicking the character’s name. The wave is expected to arrive in mailboxes and on store shelves in October.

I’ll also say that despite my unfamiliarity with this storyline the hair styles are phenomenal.

Age of Apocalypse Build-A-Figure Colossus

Now let’s take a look at some other Marvel Legends offerings that were revealed during the livestream:

Retro Collection Spider-Man 2099

Even though this is a great rendering of one of my favorite figures (with an updated deco) it’s not quite good enough to make me buy it for a third time.

If you still need the classic Spider-Man 2099 on your shelf however then it will retail for $22.99 and is available now for preorder with an expected arrival in November. Unfortunately it appears to be selling out most places already.

Tigra

Even though it’s a digital rendering you can already tell that this is going to be a big upgrade over the last Marvel Legends Tigra that came out back in 2009. It will also feature pinless articulation which should make the figure move and look even better.

Tigra doesn’t have a set release date yet but it will be sometime this year.

Future Teases

The two teases above almost certainly point to an upcoming Excalibur wave/release.

Marvel Legends Retro 3.75″ Line

I almost forgot about the 5 POS POA line that I hate with the fire of a thousand suns.

As I’ve stated before if you truly like these toys then that’s fine. Just know that they’re priced ridiculously high and that supporting the line means killing any chance of us ever getting super articulated 3.75″ figures again.

With that mini-rant out of the way here’s what was shown. No preorder info yet although it should be announced fairly soon.

The not-for-profit consumer organization tested 36 teeth whiteners purchased from online marketplaces and found that 21 of them had more than the legal amount of hydrogen peroxide (0.1%) permitted for home use in teeth whitening kits.

According to the investigation 20 products included more than 10 times too much hydrogen peroxide and the six most dangerous whiteners had more than a hundred times too much hydrogen peroxide to be legally sold. Two gel-filled syringes purchased from sellers on AliExpress however contained 30% hydrogen peroxide or 300 times the legal limit.

Meanwhile 11 of the 36 included more than 6% hydrogen peroxide which is the limit in terms of what dentists are allowed. Twelve of the products didn’t include any hydrogen peroxide at all. Only three had hydrogen peroxide levels within legally permitted limits.

The dangerous products have been removed from online sellers but these findings raise further questions about the checks and monitoring carried out by online marketplaces according to Which?

The consumer organization is calling on the government of the United Kingdom to give online marketplaces legal responsibility for the safety of products sold on their sites. Until then Which? said these platforms need to enhance their checks before including sellers on their sites and take strong action against those who break the law.

The British Dental Association (BDA) said it is pleased that Which? has shared its findings with the Office of Product Safety (OPSS) for further investigation.

Which? wants to see the OPSS urgently address these gaps in legal responsibilities as part of its review of product safety. In the meantime Which? said the OPSS should ensure marketplaces remove illegal products from sale as quickly as possible and that they do not reappear.

In developing its report the BDA advised Which? on the law that relates to the use of hydrogen peroxide by dentists as well as by hygienists and therapists on the prescription of a dentist and in products sold directly to the public.

Teeth whiteners that fail to declare their precise chemicals may cause permanent damage to teeth said Paul Woodhouse member of the BDA board.

“Hydrogen peroxide is a seriously strong chemical and not to be messed with. Dentists are trained in its usage and they also know what whitening products are effective to use and safe for teeth and gums” Woodhouse said.

“If you destroy gum tissue you are never going to get it back and you lose your teeth. If it penetrates the surface of your tooth which is likely it’s probably going to lead to the death of that tooth” Woodhouse said.

The BDA advises the public to see their dentist for safe and effective teeth whitening.

Breaking a world record is a feat that many strive to accomplish.

As you can imagine a lot of these world record titles fall within the food category. Over the years people have grown massive crops eaten copious amounts of a single food item over a specified time period and whipped up some of the most expensive and elaborate meals you can think of in an effort to obtain the title of record holder. For example the heaviest carrot ever recorded weighed over 22 lbs. The longest noodle measured nearly 10120 feet long. The most McDonald's Big Macs ever consumed in one person's lifetime is just about 30000 (via Insider).

Read more

Hershey native Christian Pulisic became the first U.S. men’s national team player to play in and win world club soccer’s biggest prize when Chelsea beat Manchester City 1-0 in Saturday’s UEFA men’s Champions League final in Porto Portugal.

Pulisic entered the game as a substitute in the 66th minute becoming the second American to ever play in a men’s Champions League final. The only other one was Neven Subotic a former U.S. youth national team player who escaped the Bosnian War with his parents and spent part of his childhood in Salt Lake City. He played for Borussia Dortmund in 2013 against Bayern Munich. But he had changed his national team allegiance to Serbia years earlier and played for that country at the 2010 World Cup.

Pulisic 22 is also the second American man to earn a European Cup winner’s medal. The first was Jovan Kirovski in 1997 when he was on Dortmund’s bench against Juventus.

As Chelsea’s players took their turns celebrating with the trophy Pulisic spent his moment with his parents Mark and Kelley. He wore a U.S. men’s national team hoodie that he had also carried onto the trophy presentation stage draped over his shoulders.

“I can’t explain it it’s still such a shock” Pulisic told CBS while taking a break from the celebrations. “I’m just so proud to be here … It’s been a difficult road for me and I couldn’t imagine winning the Champions League ever in my life and now I’m here. It’s just crazy.”

Chelsea’s goal came from Kai Havertz in the 42nd minute. Havertz ran onto Mason Mount’s through-ball and skipped by City goalkeeper Ederson Moraes before slotting the ball into an empty net.

Pulisic had a chance to score in the 73rd minute at the end of a pretty give-and-go-with Havertz. But Ederson came off his line and forced Pulisic to loft a chip shot that sailed wide left. The worldwide TV broadcast caught Pulisic slamming the turf in frustration.

“I knew I was going to have to put in the hard work defensively” Pulisic said. “I wish I put away the chance I had; I didn’t quite get under it like I wanted. But in the end this team we were always going to win this game and I’m just so proud of them.”

The title is Chelsea’s second Champions League triumph making it the 13th club to win the trophy multiple times. Its first was in 2012.

In much of the rest of the world the focus will be on Chelsea’s genius central midfielder N’Golo Kanté or Havertz or the fleet of young English players led by Mount Ben Chillwell and Reece James. Manager Thomas Tuchel will also get praise — especially from Pulisic whose pro career began under Tuchel’s tutelage at Dortmund in 2016.

But in the United States the spotlight will shine overwhelmingly on one person.

A wide swath of the American soccer community has coveted a global male star for decades the kind who can create the perception that this country has truly arrived on the global men’s soccer stage. (The U.S. women’s team has long since arrived as its players and fans rightly remind anyone who forgets them.)

Landon Donovan Claudio Reyna Tim Howard and Alexi Lalas never cleared that bar. Pulisic has been hyped to do it ever since he left PA Classics his youth club in Manheim (Pa.) Township for Dortmund’s youth setup as a 16-year-old in 2015. And there were hints of his potential well before then including when he briefly played for a Union-branded youth team in 2012.

Two years ago Pulisic took a step toward that long-craved breakthrough when Chelsea bought him for a $73 million transfer fee by far the largest ever for an American player. On Saturday Chelsea helped him take his biggest step yet.

“just a kid from hershey PA” Pulisic wrote on Instagram knowing full well he isn’t that anymore.

Then oil rained down on homes.,"CNN —

The stench permeated Dyline Thomas’ St. Croix home for weeks she said upsetting her stomach making her nose run and her throat sore.

“The smell was so strong like sulfur like rotten eggs” the 58-year-old homemaker recalled.

Then oil was discovered in her yard in mid-May. Two days earlier a flare incident occurred at the Limetree Bay refinery upwind of Thomas’s home. As flames and smoke billowed out of the flare stack oil droplets were launched into the sky carried west by the wind and rained down on nearby homes.

This month the US Environmental Protection Agency took a rare and extreme step: It ordered an emergency 60-day shutdown of the plant citing an “imminent risk” to public health. The agency which has jurisdiction over territories such as the U.S. Virgin Islands reported several incidents that released oil into the environment and sent sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide into the air both of which cause respiratory illness.

In a statement sent to CNN Limetree Bay said it intends to cooperate with the EPA and the local government in “preparing for a safe and compliant restart of the refinery.”

Now St. Croix a majority Black community in the Caribbean is weighing its economic future against the health and environmental impacts of betting big on oil.

The refinery has been a key source of jobs and revenue for an economy battered by hurricanes and the pandemic. But some of the islands’ 50000 residents are questioning whether the price is too high particularly for a community on the front lines of the climate change crisis in the form of sea level rise and increasingly powerful storms.

“We are at a crossroads” said Jennifer Valiulis the executive director of the St. Croix Environmental Association who has been critical of the plant’s operation. “We have an opportunity to examine what we want our economy to look like what we want St. Croix to be in a world that’s moving away from fossil fuels as its primary energy source.”

For decades residents of this 84-square-mile island the largest of the three major U.S. Virgin Islands have co-existed with major industrial production. The refinery first opened in 1966 and – under the management of Hess Corporation and then Hovensa – boosted its Virgin Islander workforce into the middle class.

But the environmental and health tolls grew. In 2011 the Hovensa petroleum refinery – at the time the county’s second-largest – reached a settlement with the EPA to pay more than $5.3 million for environmental violations.

The plant later closed and filed for bankruptcy. With its shutdown went more than 2000 jobs.

Earlier this year the facility – backed by private equity firms – resumed operations as Limetree Bay under a permit granted by the Trump administration with a plan to produce some 200000 barrels of oil a day.

Virginia Clairmont who runs a nonprofit working to revitalize the town of Frederiksted on the island’s western end told CNN she had misgivings about the refinery restarting in the first place. After multiple incidents she wants it closed.

But she said “if you talk about it you’ll be attacked for trying to deprive other people of jobs.”

The coronavirus pandemic only added to the islands’ economic woes shutting down a cruise industry that brings in more than 1.4 million tourists per year. Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the Virgin Islands in 2017 and the islands still bear the scars: a sailboat tossed like a toy on the shore; a tattered blue tarp over a missing roof disintegrating in the relentless tropical sun.

On St. Croix the plant restart created some 400 full-time jobs. Government officials estimate the operation could generate about $7 million in annual tax revenue.

Nellie Rivera-O’Reilly a jewelry store owner on St. Croix and former legislator was among the local senators who voted to approve the plant’s reopening. “As a business owner now I see the benefits of the refinery or any employer of that magnitude remaining viable on the island of St. Croix” she said.

Lawmakers were particularly concerned about health and safety she said and allocated money for rigorous environmental monitoring.

“These things happen in these types of industries” Rivera-O’Reilly added. “The thing to do is to make sure we learn and put in place measures to prevent this from happening.”

EPA officials say they have received hundreds of calls and emails complaining about the plant since February. Tysha Henry who grew up on St. Croix was among the callers.

Henry an HR manager in Atlanta was visiting her mother on the island in May when she said an overpowering gasoline smell jolted her awake in the middle of the night.

“It felt like I was going to asphyxiate or something” she said. The smell abated within an hour but the next morning she said her eyes and face were swollen and puffy.

“I will not be going back home as long as this smell is there” said Henry.

Lawsuits representing hundreds of residents have been filed against the refinery in recent weeks.

The EPA’s shutdown order which was handed down at a moment environmental advocacy groups are pressing the Biden administration to bring environmental justice to communities of color is just the fourth time the agency has used its emergency powers to temporarily close a plant.

It came two days after the refinery announced it was halting production on its own after the May 12 flare incident that spewed oil on homes west of the facility – homes where residents catch rainwater on their roofs and store it in below-ground cisterns for drinking bathing and cooking. The order calls for independent audits of the refinery’s operations and its ability to comply with “environmental health and safety limits.”

“This already overburdened community has suffered through at least four recent incidents that have occurred at the facility and each had an immediate and significant health impact on people and their property” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement announcing the emergency action.

Limetree CEO Jeffrey Rinker described the federal order as unlawful and “unnecessary” because the plant already had idled operations voluntarily. The company argues there’s no proof that their plant is the source of some of the noxious odors noting that a government-run landfill due west of the refinery had caught fire in early May and could have contributed to the foul smells.

In the statement sent to CNN Limetree Bay officials said: “We have no plans to restart the refinery before it is safe to do so.”

“Notwithstanding some of our struggles during this restart period we remain committed to being a good neighbor and responsible member of the St. Croix community” they said.

When the refinery reopened as Limetree in February Virgin Islands Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. a Democrat heralded it as a “big victory for St. Croix” and the broader US territory.

“In these difficult economic times I am very pleased that the Refinery is creating hundreds of well-paying quality jobs” he said in a statement.

Aides to Bryan did not respond to requests for an interview but Bryan called the flare incident “totally unacceptable.”

He expressed hope however that the plant officials “can rectify whatever the issues are and resume operations.”

Thomas the woman who had oil in her yard and said she had a reaction to noxious fumes said the smells that bothered her for weeks have eased since the closing of the refinery.

Since then she said the refinery operators have washed her vehicles given her three cases of bottled water and promised to get back in touch about oil that may have contaminated her cistern.

As unsettling as the incidents have been Thomas said she doesn’t want the plant to shut down permanently. It “brings a lot of jobs here” she said. “I would not want them to close.”

“But I want them to take more precautions” Thomas added. “You can have all the money in the world but you can’t enjoy it if you have no health.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vc3R0aG9tYXNzb3VyY2UuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvMjAyMS8wNS8zMC9tYW51ZmFjdHVyZWQtcHJvZ3Jlc3MtaGFydmV5LWFsdW1pbnVtLWluLXN0LWNyb2l4LXBhcnQtNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Manufactured Progress: Harvey Aluminum on St. Croix (Part 4),"Author’s Note: St. Croix once more stands at a crossroads. The present situation appears unworkable the path forward uncertain. It is not however the first time St. Croix has stood at such a precipice. This historical six-part series explores three moments in the past century – VI Corp Harvey Aluminum and Hess Oil – where frustration with the given situation boiled over into radical change. Breaking with the past a better future for St. Croix was declared a new foundation laid. These decreed Crucian futures sometimes aligned with the people and sometimes overrode the people. Today Limetree comes into view at just such a crossroads and once more the future of St. Croix is up for grabs.

Manufactured Progress: Harvey Aluminum in St. Croix (Part 3) (Part 4 – below)

Tipping the Scales

Although VI Corp recorded a record profit in 1963 with bonuses for local farmers and increased spending on public housing between 1957 and 1962 it averaged an annual loss of $378000. As its charter stipulated VI Corp was required to pay local taxes to make its equipment available for plowing and harvesting at hundreds of homesteads and to maintain agricultural infrastructure for all farmers on St. Croix. VI Corp also was required to invest its revenue in education healthcare and housing programs in the Virgin Islands. Governed by public need more than private gain these mandated costs led some to argue that fiscal deficits on the VI Corp balance sheet were often due to “a very unrealistic and largely misleading picture.” Yet such losses Governor Paiewonsky insisted made the continued public ownership of VI Corp both irresponsible and impossible. “The local Government cannot justify remaining in this industry” he said.

Harvey Aluminum critics on St. Croix quickly pointed out was exempted from all local taxes and was subsidized handsomely from the Virgin Islands treasury to the tune of $500000 a year. Beyond platitudes Harvey had no fixed agreement to hire locally or to increase wages. While Harvey touted how the St. Croix plant would bolster the wealth of shareholders in NYC and LA the company had no fixed plans to invest revenue in the welfare of St. Croix. In early 1964 Senators from St. Croix showed their counterparts in the Department of Interior how lucrative VI Corp’s budget would be if granted all the tax breaks and subsidies of the Harvey deal. Such an argument fell on deaf ears.

Was this socialism for wealthy corporations while the social welfare of small farmers was ruthlessly privatized? Senator Hodge refused the premise. “We are hearing cries of creeping socialism; what we want to get rid of is galloping feudalism.” Equating any defense of agriculture with approval of slavery Governor Paeiwonsky proclaimed his intention to stomp out VI Corp as the last vestige of colonialism in the Virgin Islands. “Governor Pledges to Wipe Out St. Croix Feudal System” ran one headline.

Postcolonial Prosperity?

Many Crucians were not convinced. “All over the world people are freeing themselves from colonial powers and corporations and land reform is the basic ingredient of that freedom” wrote Ralph Clifford in the St. Croix Avis in 1963. It was a point that resonated across the Caribbean. Land reform catapulted Castro’s revolution in Cuba in 1959 and Jamaica Trinidad and other Caribbean nations seized independence in the 1960s with promises of returning the land to local control. Charting a different course Paiewonsky was trying to give away “the most fertile land in St. Croix” to distant corporations Clifford argued “The single most precious and scarcest resource – LAND – is being stolen from the people.”

As Crucians mobilized around the land as the basis of their freedom and dignity many labor unions joined with the Government House in St. Thomas to insist only heavy industry could bring the Virgin Islands the economic clout it needed to assert its rightful place in the modern world. This debate between whether farms or factories offered a better metric of prosperity and progress resonated with decolonial struggles worldwide.

Paiewonsky’s commitment to aluminum plants and oil refineries was not distinctive to the Virgin Islands but followed in the footsteps of many Caribbean nations that saw export-oriented bauxite and petroleum processing as the economic foundation that could best match their growing political ambitions in the wake of WWII. But as places like Guyana Jamaica Trinidad and Puerto Rico worked to add heavy industry without subtracting peasant agriculture the Virgin Islands took a more either/or approach. And by 1963 the Governor made it clear that the promise of industrial enterprise exceeded any commitment to land as a public good. The agrarian jewel of St. Croix had to be dismantled the choicest farmland sold.

The St. Croix Avis threw up its hands in an editorial. “There is simply no justification for it for once the land is disposed of it will certainly never be regained.” But perhaps that was the point.

Agrarian Dissent Paramilitary Measures

Crucians soon hatched a plan for the Legislature of the Virgin Islands to purchase all VI Corp land. Island farmers backed by a growing coalition of hoteliers environmentalists retired expats Puerto Rican farmhands and Crucian senators insisted VI Corp farmland remain a resource for St. Croix. Proponents of industry were having none of it. Adding paramilitary violence to draconian policy a campaign of terror was launched against farmers and their defenders.

An arson spree torched farms and cane fields across St. Croix in 1963 as Crucian Senators supporting agriculture received death threats in their homes. In November the sole office providing farmers with access to federal resources on St. Croix was abruptly closed slamming the door on an annual flow of over $1 million in aid for agriculture on the island. “I doubt seriously whether any other branch of the Federal or local government has invested as much in ‘self-help’ for the people of St. Croix” Arthur Golden complained to the St. Croix Avis.

As “one of the largest sugar crops in the history of the VI Corp” was recorded in May 1964 Governor Paiewonsky formally announced that all VI Corp assets along with 2400 acres of farmland on St. Croix would be auctioned off to the highest bidder in a few days time. The rushed auction the Governor explained lumped all the farmland together to encourage bidding by highly capitalized industries. Individual farmers by design were priced out of the bidding. The auction also expressly prohibited the Legislature from bidding (or even matching the winning bid). Crucian Senators noted the announcement came days after the end of the legislative session preventing any discussion or oversight of the sale. And ten days later a subsidiary of Harvey Aluminum placed the winning bid on the still beating agricultural heart of St. Croix.

Thousands of Crucians flooded the streets of Frederiksted and Christiansted demanding justice for agriculture. “Why should a corporation like Harvey own half of St. Croix?” asked Senator Augustin Doward. Decrying the “20th century Judases” in St. Thomas who were allowing Crucian farmland to be sold to Harvey Senator Randall James was resolute: “VI Corp land must be had for the people.” “Crucians” wrote the West End News “cannot sit back idly and watch the spring of life being sapped. So fight we will!”

Any defense of public investments in agriculture was Paiewonsky responded “the rankest form of colonialism.” Describing VI Corp as a “feudal lord” intent on holding back progress Paiewonsky was delighted to hand over VI Corp land to the engine of private business. Industry offered a proven route of modern development and as Paiewonsky pointed out proceeds from the sale helped establish and endow the University of the Virgin Islands.

It was an outlook soon broadcast across St. Croix as Harvey Aluminum commissioned its own newspaper and radio station on Recovery Hill. Disguising its corporate owners this media conglomerate routinely celebrated the destruction of agriculture as evidence of progress in the Virgin Islands. “It is good that the VI Corp property has been put up for sale” one story began “St. Croix has had a sugar economy for long enough.” Reporting explained how Caribbean nations that encourage farming can remain stuck in feudalism. One story compared those rallying support for agriculture to Hitler and Stalin.

Although VI Senators were uniformly opposed to the land sale and unanimously petitioned the Department of Interior to block the sale a month later Senators from St. Thomas and St. John were coming around to the sale. Brushing aside accusations of kickbacks and ongoing protests in St. Croix in June 1964 the Legislature endorsed the sale of VI Corp assets and land to Harvey Aluminum. Support came almost entirely from St. Thomas and St. John.

A year later and in the midst of another record-breaking sugar harvest Harvey announced plans to phase out agriculture on St. Croix. The modern sugar factory was dismantled and shipped to Venezuela (where it is said to still operate). Purchased by Harvey for exactly ten dollars the collectively owned farming equipment that helped homestead farmers plow their fields and harvest crops each season was driven into the sea. Today their rusted-out remains are a marginal diving attraction on St. Croix.

Before the sale several villages of cane-cutters and farmhands from Vieques were promised that they could remain in their homes and retain access to the gardens they farmed (many were in the process of becoming homestead farmers). After the sale they were told to leave. Some chose to stay. “They ripped the roofs off the houses and left everything to rot” one farmer recalled to me in an interview.

Want amidst Wealth

The revolution from agriculture to industry on St. Croix was far from a natural transition. Decreed rather than democratically decided the eradication of small farms and enticement of big factories to St. Croix unfolded over the protests of residents. And even as Harvey and Hess transformed the Virgin Islands into one of the wealthiest Caribbean economies on paper many Virgin Islanders felt newly alienated from the manufactured might of export-oriented chemical processing.

You cannot cook a meal of nor build a home from bauxite or petroleum products alone. Yet the refinement of these commodities on St. Croix proved immensely lucrative for Harvey and Hess and generous wages soon lifted a class of workers into the comforts of the middle class. Salaries at the factories were double the going rate for labor in agriculture or hospitality. For many jobs at the plant became an accessible ladder into modest affluence.

Yet these factory jobs were never plentiful enough to employ everyone displaced by the managed decline of agriculture. Many working-class Black and Puerto Rican farmers found themselves stranded between a collapsing public food system and the rising cost of everything they now needed to buy. Even as the territory achieved the highest per capita GDP in the Eastern Caribbean in the 1970s this industrial boom did not exactly free the Virgin Islands from dependency so much as deepen the islands reliance on costly imports and external assistance. Federal aid to the VI actually tripled in the decade after industry set up shop in St. Croix.

This paradox of want among wealth proliferated as industry monopolized the economy of St. Croix. GDP of the Virgin Islands skyrocketed from $25 million in 1960 to $500 million in 1975 driven almost entirely by the output of Harvey Aluminum and Hess Oil. That same period witnessed unemployment among Crucians shift from almost non-existent into “a serious problem” that crested 10% of the working population. Nor was employment at the factories without strife. After the first batch of Crucians went on strike at Harvey and Hess for the wages promised both firms came to rely on workers imported from elsewhere.

It cannot be denied: industry brought profound wealth to the Virgin Islands. But it was a wealth that often came to feel just out of reach for most Crucians. It also came at a tremendous ecological cost.

An Aluminum Nail in the Coffin of Agriculture

After Harvey took control of VI Corp much of the usurped farmland was simply fenced off. Occasionally Hess Oil which purchased the land from Harvey would sell a section back to the local government or to private developers. A government report in 1965 warned that the “indiscriminate urbanization” of former VI Corp farmland would soon render agriculture on St. Croix impossible to reboot. “This land should be able to provide for most of the food needs of the islands” the report concluded but urgent action was required to zone fertile fields as exclusively agricultural.

Instead much of the prized farmland of St. Croix became real estate. As food prices predictably soared one large section of farmland was paved over to welcome the island’s first big box grocery store and shopping mall. The residential developments and commercial strips that now crowd Centerline Road distract the imagination from the prolific fields and proud farmers that claimed this ground just 50 years ago.

Along the gentle slopes of St. Croix the architectural record seems to jump directly from plantation ruins to suburban clutter a leap that quietly extinguishes the monumental accomplishments of VI Corp and homesteader farmers. And today on St. Croix it is hard to find any celebration of the homesteads that rescued the island from the Great Depression rebuilt the Virgin Islands on a more equitable foundation and resisted the imposition of industry. So much has already been forgotten.

Industrial pollution has only added environmental injury to this historical insult. Absent effective oversight Harvey Aluminum and Hess Oil both salted the landscape of St. Croix with toxic waste an environmental fact that further removes cultivation from the possibilities of the present. Today a mindboggling array of petrochemicals have saturated St. Croix’s sole aquifer and mismanaged slagheaps from bauxite refining contaminate soils all around Krause Lagoon. While the Harvey and Hess plants were only designed to be in operation for a few decades the contamination of soil and groundwater will endure for generations.

In the 1960s the territorial government rebuffed the populist claims of agriculture and installed bauxite and crude oil on the throne of the St. Croix economy. And within the decade the breadbasket of the Lesser Antilles found itself rather abruptly divorced from the land. The rippling effects of the rapid industrialization of St. Croix namely suburbanization and pollution now conspire against any easy restoration of that agrarian crown. To reimagine Crucian farms capable of feeding the island requires herculean investment and ingenuity.

The immensity of the challenge has not dissuaded a new generation of farmers on St. Croix. Finding ever more creative ways to cultivate land on the margins of development today many Crucian farmers aspire to meet that vast social need. There is still so much to be done to rebuild a robust local food system for the people of St. Croix. And yet just one lifetime ago that is exactly what VI Corp and modest homestead farms provided.

Part five of this six-part series will discuss the origins of Hess Oil on St. Croix as well as the impacts of oil refining on the wider Caribbean economy.

They knew the local hospital was already under pressure from Covid so they thought they shouldn’t dash off prematurely to the maternity clinic. They had plenty of time didn’t they? Then the baby decided to get on with the business of being born. There wasn’t even time to get to the car. Waters found himself delivering baby Leonardo right there at home on the stairs. Even the MD of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (UK Ireland Middle East and Africa) can’t always rely on technology to do the job.

Waters was born and bred in Portsmouth and remains a diehard Pompey fan and season ticket holder. Portsmouth FC are currently in the upper echelons of Division One and challenging for the playoffs. Not long ago they were in the Premiership and winning the FA Cup then they slid into relegation and near administration. “We’re on our way back” says Waters confidently. He was one of those brave fans who bought a share in the club to save them from oblivion before they were bought by former Disney chief exec Michael Eisner. “If the club had spent more of its millions investing in talent development and training pitches instead of bringing in a lot of expensive ageing players we’d be in a much better state now.” He applies the same thinking to giving youth a chance at Hewlett Packard: experience is not essential motivation is.

“The opportunities I was given at a young age shaped my desire to want to do the same for the next generation” says Waters. As a kid he had two passions – football and fashion.

What is a workday?

Workday is a cloud-based technology partner which primarily focuses on application areas for human resource management (HCM) resource planning (ERP) and financial planning. Workday provides an all-in-one package designed for scale enterprises particularly those with numerous places kudos to functionalities such as payroll processing calendar management human resource (HRM) and telecommunication services. To know more about the workday workday training is pretty beneficial for the organisations and individual growth.

Why workday?

Organisations prefer the workday because of its competitive advantages. They are:

Satisfied customers are higher than the market average.

Every quarter Workday introduces new configurations and abilities.

Workday includes features such as Manager Self-Service (MSS).

Processing data has tremendously increased as a result of Workday’s implementation of in-memory software development.

Workday’s business model is a rare commodity in a market dominated by data structures.

An ecosystem that is very active and can be a partner with any organisation rapidly.

Who uses a workday?

Workday is used by large companies in various industries such as health care system training industrial production financial services technological advancements and department stores ranging from mid-sized businesses to Top multinational enterprises. Here are a few of their most excellent remarkable clients:

Bank of America

Hewlett Packard Enterprise etc.

Now we will explore how the workday acts as an ERP system for planning HR and finance.

Workday Cloud– Workday is a SaaS (Software as a Service) supplier which provides enterprise employees with cloud-based administering and financial planning. Workday was established by Dave Duffield the former CEO of PeopleSoft and Oracle PeopleSoft.

Workday seems like the following Erp software based on a variety of specified requirements and a SaaS model. On-demand software products are progressively growing in popularity. Businesses need to save money by paying an additional fee for such on-demand strategies instead of installing and configuring the apps from their own devices.

Specifically at which standard SAP and Oracle seem to be legacy on-premises to incorporate employees’ operational activities and financial tracking successfully at low-cost also with cloud + membership. Nonetheless as competing companies such as Oracle and SAP focus mainly on the cloud the competition is heating up.

ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) is a mission-critical company cumulative distribution function for analysing company funds to productively use organisational resources elements (human resources goods finance and information) as the foundation of company governance. Yes Workday was founded as a hybrid Cloud corporation with a primary concern for human resources policies and procedures.

Workday combined into a single system seems to have a robust market assessment. Hence operations like job opportunities education and development personnel assessment personnel management/placement billing repayment required work management skills are straightforward to use and satisfied customers are satisfied with 97%.

Establishment of an Environment in Collaboration with Industry Partners:

Workday also has characteristics of the environment that it constructs among cloud services. In addition for various payroll characteristics they announced a partnership with top payroll companies in each region such that Workday’s payroll ecosystem could even stand collaboratively with the API.

Workday Cloud Computing System:

Furthermore the corporation promotes society by introducing PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) for component enlargement and software development customised to consumers’ company requirements via the Workday Cloud Service.

Difference Between a Legacy Erp System

Workday has built a cloud-compatible program from scratch and acknowledges characteristics which no other company could indeed replicate. With all this the business has vanquished rivals who added extra ‘cloud-like functionality to traditional approaches.

The legacy Erp system would be that the UI and other implications are complicated due to the obstacles also strengthened by company acquisition seeing as independent cultural and organisational structures were completed at the proposal of the customer; the improvement was a challenging task. As previously stated Workday achieved convenience of use and a convenient UI by reiterating personalisation strengthening good models and updating with new requests.

Furthermore the issue of a long and tedious upgrade and complex and expensive tasks is eradicated. Whenever it relates to cloud ERP sellers will take total accountability for updating on behalf of their customers and it can be affordable over time.

Workday offers several certifications namely workday finance and accounts workday HCM workday finance workday SaaS workday HR and workday integrations etc.

Now we will discuss the key features of the workday that makes it an excellent cloud-based ERP platform for performing special operations.

HRM enables businesses to organise better and manages their labour force. Other characteristics involve earning profit and employee benefits in higher levels of self usability for managers and employees.

Workday’s talent acquisition solution assists organisations in finding sharing engaging and picking the correct internally and externally applicants. It handles the entire recruiting development cycle in a single platform allowing for accountability and collaborative effort from across the hiring manager. Consumers could also evaluate what roles are accessible or even what particular types of applicants they need but instead generate requisitions.

Workday’s talent acquisition pack provides information for influential organisational culture development and compensation. It includes management-friendly features such as login goal management process improvement career development and performance-development schedule.

Users of Workday’s CRM system can execute various payroll computations manage batch calculations by community or labourer have versatility with profits and exemptions and operate financial statements.

Workday tends to make it as smooth as possible for staff members to monitor their time using a desktop mobile device or smartphone to the timer in and out. And then for companies that require physical timesheets these can be integrated with Workday through the use of an API so that there are no issues here anyway.

Conclusion:

Unless you’ve visualised your objectives and determined that Workday is the workable alternative to assist you in achieving them the very next step is implementation. That’s where the actual work begins.



Even though Workday frameworks impact many other people in an organisation it is critical to plan appropriately for your modernisation. It’s crucial to collaborate with such an IT specialist who has considerable experience with Workday to facilitate seamless integration.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzI5L252aWRpYS1wbGFucy1kYXRhLWNlbnRlci1haS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://siliconangle.com/2021/05/29/nvidia-plans-data-center-ai/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzI5L252aWRpYS1wbGFucy1kYXRhLWNlbnRlci1haS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Here’s an excerpt of what San Jose Mercure News was reporting last week:

“The Hilton bid contemplates that the hotel will assume the name ‘Signia by Hilton San Jose’ or another name that includes ‘Signia’ in it and that it will be managed by Hilton upon its reopening” bankruptcy court records show. The hotel’s owners have in multiple court filings stated that they expect a new operator to provide $45 million to help bolster the hotel’s finances. “The Hilton bid includes financial support that the debtors believe is commensurate with the needs of the hotel and the debtors’ needs to exit Chapter 11” the hotel’s owner stated in the court papers.

Are Fairmont and Accor not as helpful in bringing in business as Hilton?

Accor Management accused hotel owner Eagle Canyon Capital of not providing enough financial support to the hotel operators until revenue and occupancy levels could return to the pre-COVID levels The owner of the Fairmont claims that Accor Management did not sufficiently help the hotel owner to address the crumbling finances of the Fairmont San Jose.

You can argue that the Fairmont brand and Accor are not well known in the United States unlike in Canada and Europe.

Hilton by Signia (No longer Hilton Signia)?

Hilton announced its convention brand to address Marriott Marquis. It was supposed to be Hilton Signia and not Signia by Hilton.

Conclusion

It will be challenging for Hilton to get its Signia brand off the ground due to lessened demand for large business meetings and convention hotels in the next few years.

Perhaps having these hotels as Signia by Hilton and not Hilton Signia helps with other hotel owners that may have exclusive agreements with the chain not to have the same brand within the set distance?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZmx5ZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjkvaGlsdG9uLWJlLW15LWd1ZXN0LWNlcnRpZmljYXRlcy1oYXZlLXByb2JhYmx5LWJlZW4tZXh0ZW5kZWQtdW50aWwtZW5kLW9mLTIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilton Be My Guest Certificates Have (Probably?) Been Extended Until End Of 2021,"Hilton Be My Guest Certificates are sometimes issued as compensation when a guest has encountered significant problems during a stay. They are physical paper certificates that can be used to get a free night (standard room best available rate) at any Hilton hotel of the same brand. For example if your problematic stay was at a Hilton DoubleTree your certificate will entitle you to a free night at any Hilton DoubleTree hotel.

I received one in early 2020 and due to the pandemic didn’t have much opportunity to use it. It was originally due to expire in March 2021 but after emailing them Hilton agreed to extend it until the end of June. I still don’t really have any trips planned where it would come in useful so thought I’d ask Hilton if they might consider extending it again. This was the response:

“Thank you for your response please allow me to share with you our most up to date information regarding BMG extension.



I am pleased to advise that the Certificates have now been extended for use until December 31st 2021 we are not offering points in lieu of certificates at this time. Therefore you are now able to use your certificate for the remainder of this year I hope this is helpful and hope you have a lovely stay when it comes.”

Bottom line

This extension is really good news for anyone with an expiring Hilton Be My Guest Certificate. Extending them all the way through to the end of the year is actually quite generous and pro-active given that at least some travel will be possible this summer.

I do have one slight caveat though which is that I’m not 100% certain that the agent who replied is correct. When I asked for an extension before I had to provide the specific certificate number and other details in order for the extension to be processed. It sounds like this time the certificates are being extended through to the end of the year automatically but I’m not sure how that would work.

Remember these are physical certificates with an expiry date written on them (and some hotel staff will have never seen one before anyway). If you have an expiring certificate I would strongly recommend emailing Hilton ([email protected]) yourself about the extension. That way you will have a written record that your certificate has indeed been extended which should hopefully make redeeming it a lot smoother!

I’ve asked Hilton for further confirmation of the Be My Guest Certificate extension policy and will update this article when they reply.

UPDATE: I heard back form Hilton and this is what they said:

“Yes you are correct all will happen automatically I had all the details on your file to process this; just make sure you take the physical certificate to redeem.”

I would therefore assume that if you have already previously requested an extension and you sent in your certificate details it has probably been automatically extended to the end of the year. If you haven’t previously asked for an extension though you will need to do so in order for Hilton to have the information required to process things. Either way personally I would email them anyway just to make sure there was a written record of the extension to 31st December 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9mYW1pbHktZnJpZW5kbHktYWxsLWluY2x1c2l2ZS1yZXNvcnRzLXlvdS1jYW4tYm9vay13aXRoLXBvaW50cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,11 all-inclusive beach resorts you can book with points,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available. View the current offers here.

When it comes to family vacations the beach is best. Staying at a high-end hotel in a city is great but I find that it's usually just a place to rest between explorations. When I travel with two young kids a beach vacation with a pool kids activity center and food right at hand make for a perfect holiday.

The main problem with many Caribbean and Mexican resorts is that the cost of the food can add up. I cringe when I see my bill at the end of the trip knowing that the kids probably didn't eat half of what we purchased. Feeding a family of four (including drinks for the adults) is no joking matter. My ""free"" vacation using points and miles does not end up anywhere close to free.

The high cost of feeding a family on vacation makes using points for an all-inclusive resort appealing. Some properties charge more after the first two adults but the cost is typically minimal. So if you're looking to get away for an all-inclusive vacation here are 11 properties in the sunny Caribbean and Mexico where you can use hotel points.

The Hyatt Ziva Rose Hall is just 10 minutes from Sangster International Airport (MBJ). The resort includes two separate pool areas — one for relaxation and one with activities including a swim-up bar. You can participate in anything from dance lessons on the pool deck to water ping-pong. There are many beach activities as well all included such as kayaking boogie-boarding and snorkeling. There is a sister resort nearby the Hyatt Zilara Rose Hall which is an adults-only resort.

There are eight choices for dining including a buffet Italian restaurant Asian restaurant steakhouse jerk shack beach grill pub deli and beachfront grill. That's on top of four different bars for a variety of drinks and beach cocktails.

The kids club is a highlight with a game room playground and many other activities throughout the day. You can drop off kids ages three to 12 throughout the day for as long as you want.

You can earn World of Hyatt points with the World of Hyatt Credit Card. You can also transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards to your Hyatt account at a 1:1 ratio from cards such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve or Chase Sapphire Preferred Card.

Hilton Rose Hall Resort & Spa in Montego Bay Jamaica

The Hilton Rose Hall Resort & Spa also in Montego Bay offers a private beach and multiple pools. Plus the resort includes access to its Sugar Mill Falls Water Park for all guests. This waterpark features a 280-foot slide and a lazy river. In short having a waterpark onsite is a huge perk. This resort also offers tennis (and tennis lessons) a kids club a teen zone and nightly entertainment.

There are lots of dining options from casual to fine dining. Plus there are bars a coffee shop and even a swim-up bar with food and drinks. Unfortunately room service is not part of the all-inclusive experience. I like ordering room service while the kids are getting ready for the day and I wouldn't want to pay for it when I can get the same food for free elsewhere on the property.

A free night at this property typically ranges between 62000 to 70000 Hilton Honors points for a double-occupancy standard room. However availability is sparse for some dates -- especially if you want to book a standard room award. Check out our post on 16 ways to earn more Hilton Honors points for tips if you need more points for your redemption.

(Screenshot courtesy of Hilton)

You can have up to four guests per room but will need to pay extra at check-in if your third or fourth guest is over the age of five. The fee is $75 per night for ages 6-14 and $99 per night for ages 15 and up. However some reports show that guests were not charged any additional fee for kids in the room when staying on points reservations. Not having to pay extra guest fees could be a considerable saving when staying as a family.

Also if you have Silver Gold or Diamond Hilton status you'll receive your fifth night free when redeeming points. Having status with Hilton is easy since all of the Hilton credit cards including the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass® Card Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card and Hilton Honors American Express Card give you automatic elite status.

Holiday Inn Resort Montego Bay in Montego Bay Jamaica

The Holiday Inn Resort Montego Bay is another all-inclusive property in Montego Bay where you can use your hotel points. Although you might not equate a Holiday Inn property with a nice resort this hotel receives excellent reviews. And many travelers with IHG Platinum elite status have even reported being upgraded to a one-bedroom suite. Onsite there are kids' activities and a spa for adults. Plus this resort is one of the few on this list with a casino.

This resort is closed until June 12 2021 and there's no availability until June 27 2021. But once it reopens you'll typically need to pay 50000 IHG Rewards Club points per night for double occupancy. However note that cash rates are low for some dates.

(Screenshot courtesy of IHG)

It is one of the few properties where kids 12 and under stay for free — no extra points or cash required — so you can maximize your IHG Rewards Club points. However you'll need to pay an $80 surcharge per person for the third and fourth adults in a room.

If you have the IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card or the IHG One Rewards Traveler Credit Card you can get a fourth-night reward when you redeem IHG Rewards points for a stay of three or more nights. If you need to earn more IHG Rewards Club points you can transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards to your IHG account or wait for a good IHG buy points sale.

Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana in Punta Cana Dominican Republic

The Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana opened in late 2019 after some delays. Most guests say the resort is beautiful and some guests even recommend it over the Hyatt Ziva Cancun. It's a great place to stay on points in Punta Cana. And for an adults-only vacation the Hyatt Zilara Cap Cana is right next door.

This resort should be on your family's radar. The hotel is only 10 minutes away from the airport (PUJ) and boasts multiple pools a lazy river and three water slides. There are 12 restaurants and bars a swim-up bar a kids club and live entertainment.

A standard room which you can reserve with points is over 600 square feet. This property costs 25000 World of Hyatt points for the first two guests plus 12500 points per additional guest in the room. As at all other Hyatt Ziva properties children two and under are free.

If you need to earn more Hyatt points for your stay you have ample opportunities. For example you could sign-up for the World of Hyatt Credit Card (or spend on your card if you already have a World of Hyatt Card). You could also buy Hyatt points or transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points to Hyatt.

Hilton La Romana in La Romana Dominican Republic

The Hilton La Romana is just 20 minutes away from La Romana Airport (LRM) and 45 minutes from Punta Cana Airport. The property is on Bayahibe Beach with calm crystal-clear waters. And there's an adjacent sister resort that carries the same name but is adult-only -- so make sure you book the right property for your stay.

The family-friendly property features five restaurants on-site a kids club a teens club a casino and a waterpark with slides and a lazy river. This property typically costs between 45000 and 68000 points a night for a standard room with double occupancy.

(Screenshot courtesy of Hilton)

However beware that availability is sparse for standard rooms during select periods. And only kids two and under stay for free. After the first two guests the resort will charge an additional $60 per night per child age three through 12 and an additional $90 per guest 13 and older.

Emotions All Inclusive Puerto Plata in Playa Dorada Dominican Republic

Emotions All-Inclusive Puerto Plata. (Photo by JT Genter/The Points Guy)

The Emotions All-Inclusive Puerto Plata resort belongs to Choice Privileges' Ascend Hotel Collection. Ascend Collection properties vary greatly but this hotel is by no means the fanciest all-inclusive on the list. However just 15 minutes away from Puerto Plata International Airport (POP) this hotel is very convenient if you can find flights into this smaller airport.

Choice Privileges changes the award pricing for its properties every few months. So although this property cost only 8000 Choice Privileges points per night when TPG senior writer Katie Genter and her husband stayed at this all-inclusive resort for a month it now costs 30000 Choice Privileges points per night. Based on TPG's valuations this is worth about $180 a night -- but you can typically find paid rates much less expensive. Choice caps rooms on points at a maximum of four guests per room.

Hyatt Ziva Cancun in Cancun Mexico

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

The Hyatt Ziva Cancun is probably the nicest all-inclusive property at which you can use your points. And its suites — like the Pyramid Suite category — are especially lovely for families that need more space.

This property is at one end of the Hotel Zone of Punta Cancun with a beach on both sides. There is no reason to leave the hotel but the location allows you to walk easily to many restaurants and shops nearby. The resort features three infinity pools two separate beach areas and complimentary pool cabanas. There are lots of daily activities on the pool deck. Plus there are kayaks stand-up paddleboards and snorkeling gear at the beach.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

There is food and drink everywhere with eight restaurants three lounges and six bars. There is truly something for everyone from sit-down fine dining to an on-the-go food truck. I've been to this property three times with my family and the food offerings are just right.

Your children will love the kids club area with games arts and crafts video games movies and disco parties. There is also a fantastic pool area with a few different play structures slides and waterfalls.

Like the Hyatt Ziva Montego Bay and Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana this hotel costs 25000 World of Hyatt points a night for double occupancy.

(Screenshot courtesy of Hyatt)

Kids two and under stay for free but other extra adults or children will cost 12500 points a night. Check out our guide on how to quickly stock up on Hyatt points if you need more Hyatt points.

Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta in Puerto Vallarta Mexico

(Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy)

The Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta is on the south side in Conchas Chinas the quieter side of Puerto Vallarta. So you will not see as many vendors and outside tourists on the beach. And you are only a short taxi ride into Old Town. The hotel includes seven (yes seven!) pools — five infinity pools and two kid-friendly options.

What is great about this property is that every single room has an ocean view. Some rooms even have hot tubs on the balconies. And if your kids are old enough you can ask about staying in one of the swim-up rooms where you can walk right outside and into the pool.

View from a room's balcony. (Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy)

As with all Hyatt all-inclusive properties your minifridge is stocked with drinks and snacks — again all complimentary. Room service will even replenish your fridge every day. Room service is also available for no additional fee throughout the day.

Families can enjoy the kids club an oceanfront fitness center the spa and many food and beverage options. There are food and beverage carts around the property to ensure you are never hungry possibly the hotel's best feature.

(Photo by Eric Rosen/The Points Guy)

This property only requires 20000 World of Hyatt points per night for double occupancy 5000 points less than the Hyatt Ziva Cancun Hyatt Ziva Montego Bay or Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana. This pricing is a steal; this all-inclusive property can easily be $600 a night during peak times.

(Screenshot courtesy of Hyatt)

Kids 2 and under stay for free but additional guests will cost another 10000 points per night.

Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos in Los Cabos Mexico

(Photo by Melanie Lieberman/The Points Guy)

The Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos is located in San Jose Del Cabo which means you are closer to the airport but farther away from the nightlife. The property is located right on the beach in Cabo which makes it great for building sandcastles. But there can be a strong riptide. Swimming in the ocean is typically not recommended -- but there is a beautiful infinity pool.

The kids club is excellent with activities inside the club and at the pool right outside. The kids club pool includes a mini-waterpark with five slides. There is also a playground with a jungle gym and motorized minicars. Having a playground at a resort is special.

(Photo by Melanie Lieberman/The Points Guy)

When using points you can book either a Master King or Master Double. These large 584-square-foot rooms have pull-out couches so there is plenty of space for everyone to sleep in comfort. Plus these rooms have an outside balcony that is perfect for adults while the kids are sleeping. Like the Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta this property only requires 20000 World of Hyatt points per night for double occupancy.

(Screenshot courtesy of Hyatt)

Kids under 3 stay for free but any additional child or adult in the room will cost 10000 points per night. Rates at this property seem to be a little less than some of the other Hyatt all-inclusive properties but it is still an excellent use of your points.

Hilton Puerto Vallarta Resort in Puerto Vallarta Mexico

Banderas Bay in Puerto Vallarta Mexico (Photo by Westend61/Getty Images)

The Hilton Puerto Vallarta Resort on the Bay of Banderas on the west coast of Mexico is only about 10 minutes from the airport. Although this is a smaller resort there are still three pools (one adults-only) and a beautiful beach.

This hotel has six restaurants and four bars although many restaurants require reservations and have timed dining. They are also not open every day of the week. There are always a few restaurants available but your options will not be as plentiful as at someplace like the Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta. However there is an adult-only Hacienda and the resort includes room service.

Related: 11 things you should know before visiting Mexico

The kids club (ages 4 to 12 years old) includes minigolf a wading pool a giant movie and game room and many other daily activities. Typical hours are from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. but there is a pajama party for the kids where they roast marshmallows on select weekends. The hours are shorter than some other resort kids clubs and meals are not served (just snacks in case kids get hungry). You can hire babysitters for kids as young as four months old at $10/hour per child from the kids club. This pricing is extremely reasonable for babysitting services at a resort. But during peak dates the fees increase.

When you use your points at this property you are charged anywhere between 46000 and 70000 Hilton Honors points for double occupancy.

(Screenshot courtesy of Hilton)

Some of the features of this hotel do not appear to be as expansive as the Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta but there's excellent standard award availability. Plus kids five and under stay for free which is huge. But after the first two guests the resort charges $65 per child age six through 12 and typical adult pricing for kids 13+.

Viva Wyndham Maya Resort in Playa Del Carmen Mexico

Wyndham has eight all-inclusive hotels you can book with points in the Caribbean and Mexico. Best of all six of the locations are family-friendly Viva resorts. I'll highlight one of these resorts the Viva Wyndham Maya Resort in Playa del Carmen Mexico because it offers good availability and doesn't have minimum stay requirements.

This oceanfront resort offers five restaurants 24-hour snacks a kid's club and a mini-disco for kids. The rooms look uninspiring but the beach is enormous and the pools look relaxing. For 30000 Wyndham points per night families can book a superior garden-view room with two queen beds or a deluxe two-queen room that may have a better view. If you need more points check out our article on 16 ways to earn Wyndham Rewards points.

(Screenshot courtesy of Wyndham)

Wyndham's website will allow you to book rooms with up to four guests. However the website displays a notice stating:

go free® award nights at Viva Wyndham Maya – All-Inclusive Resort are valid for meals beverages and other resort amenities for up to two guests. If you have more than two guests staying in your room additional resort fees will apply. Please contact Wyndham Rewards Member Services at 866-996-7937 for details on additional fees.

So if you are traveling with your family you may want to call soon after you book a refundable award to check pricing for your additional family members. Then you can decide whether to keep your award or change your booking. After all cash prices and Go Fast awards (Wyndham's version of points and cash rates) vary based on the number of guests in your room. So you may find that booking a cash rate or Go Fast award provides better value.

In 2019 AMResorts and Choice Privileges became partners. As such you can redeem Choice Privileges points to stay at AMResorts locations in Mexico the Caribbean and several Central American countries. Family-friendly AMResorts brands you can book include Dreams Resorts & Spas Now Resorts & Spas and Sunscape Resorts & Spas.

There are now about 29 family-friendly AMResorts locations bookable with Choice points. Many of these resorts are high-end properties. But when using points most (if not all) resorts cap you at two guests per room including kids.

You could try booking a room with your points and calling the hotel directly to see if you can upgrade to a different room and pay extra for any additional guests. But your results may vary. Alternatively you could book two rooms with your points -- at twice the cost.

Rates are typically between 25000 and 100000 points per night depending on the property. If you are low on points you can transfer American Express Membership Rewards points or open the Choice Privileges Visa Signature Card. Or you can wait to buy Choice points during a promotion.

The information for the Choice Privileges Visa Signature card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

Holiday Inn Resort Ixtapa

At the Holiday Inn Resort Ixtapa on Mexico's Pacific coast you are capped at just two guests per room when redeeming IHG Rewards points. Plus your only choice when redeeming points is an ""All Inclusive Standard Room"" that states ""Bed type and smoking preference cannot be guaranteed as it will be allocated upon arrival based on availability"" in the description.

So if you need a specific room type want to book for more than two guests or don't want to be assigned a smoking room this may not be the resort for you. You could book an award (check the cancellation policy before booking) and call the hotel in advance to see if they can give you a room that will fit your needs. But the system doesn't allow families to stay on points easily.

Bottom line

With so many all-inclusive options it's easy to redeem your points for a genuinely free stay. If you are going to go the all-inclusive route I suggest starting to increase your point balance now with World of Hyatt IHG Rewards Hilton Honors Choice Privileges or Wyndham Rewards.

If I had to pick my favorite I'd choose the Hyatt Ziva properties. The brand has done a fantastic job of providing families with many activities and dining options. Its kid's clubs are a huge highlight. And it has also priced its properties very competitively by only requiring 20000 to 25000 points per night for double occupancy (though once you add a couple of kids aged 3+ to the reservation you are basically looking at the same award price for two rooms as all sharing one).

We’ve done some digging and here’s their net worth ranked from the OG to the newbie.

When it comes to the Real Housewives franchise it’s without a doubt that the Beverly Hills ladies lead the pack with their lavish and extravagant lifestyles. Since its debut in 2010 the reality show has featured a handful of Los Angeles’ crème de la crème that showed us how to: live in a behemoth of a Gothic mansion (Carlton Gebbia from season 4) fly about on a private plane (lady boss Adrienne Maloof) go on an impromptu holiday (Erika Jayne and Lisa Rinna’s infamous Tokyo trip) and obsess over Dolce & Gabbana (looking at you Dorit Kemsley).

Kathy Hilton (US$350 million)

Charming fans with her quirky sense of humour and no-nonsense attitude the franchise’s latest addition ranks first in the net worth game. Thanks to her famous Hilton surname Kathy 62 has a jaw-dropping net worth of US$350 million according to Celebrity Net Worth. The designer-cum-entrepreneur is married to hotel mogul Rick Hilton but remains busy with her side hustles. She hosted NBC’s I Want to Be a Hilton (2005) released a signature skincare line on HSN and launched her own Kathy Hilton Collection currently available in 400 stores worldwide. The mother of Paris and Nicky Hilton resides in a US$10 million Bel-Air mansion that she bought back in 2016 per Radar Online.

Kyle Richards (US$100 million)

Just like her sister Kathy Hilton the last standing OG housewife has some unattainable wealth to boast of. According to Cheatsheet Richards 52 and her property tycoon husband Mauricio Umansky have a combined net worth of US$100 million. The former child star still earns money from acting gigs and her clothing lines (NYFW anyone?) and is a philanthropist at heart. But she equally loves to splurge hard with her shopping dinner parties and moving to bigger houses seen on the show.

Previously Richards and family lived in the iconic 6229 sq ft Bel-Air mansion that’s now re-listed for US$6 million per Bravo TV. Richards then bought an even bigger Encino mansion in 2017 for US$8.25 million. According to Trulia her new property is a “seven-bed eight-bath estate” that once belonged to Motown singer Smokey Robinson.

Dorit Kemsley (US$50 million)

The mother-of-two surely knows how to zhuzh it up with branded designer outfits and her famous glam squad. Kemsley 44 is married to real estate developer and celebrity manager Paul Kemsley and together they have a combined net worth of US$50 million. Despite bankruptcy rumours (thanks Camille!) the fashion designer is still living large in their US$7.5 million mansion and working on swimwear line Beverly Beach and a new bridal collection with Nektaria as seen on her Instagram.

Speaking of Instagram Dorit also loves to flaunt her obsession with branded items. She recently shared a closet full of Louis Vuitton goodies and confessed on Instagram Live that the Fendi Baguette was the first handbag she bought inspired by Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and the City.

Lisa Rinna (US$10 million)

The vivacious actress has a long resume of films and TV shows (Melrose Place Days of Our Lives) under her belt combined with a line-up of TV hosting and appearances (Dancing with the Stars and Celebrity Apprentice). According to Celebrity Net Worth Rinna has a reported net worth of US$10 million and took home US$500000 for her appearances on Real Housewives. Outside of acting Rinna has penned three books modelled nude for Christian Cowan’s campaign and earned US$2 million from endorsing adult diapers brand Depends per Radar Online. “That Depends job saved our bacon. I got paid more money to do that than I got paid to do anything ever in my life” she told Bravo TV.

Garcelle Beauvais (US$8 million)

The actress joined the show in season 10 and has quickly become a fan favourite. With over 75 movie credits to her name (including a cameo on Spider-Man: Homecoming) it’s not surprising to learn that Beauvais 54 has a reported net worth of US$8 million. This year the mother-of-two has also appeared in Eddie Murphy’s sequel Coming 2 America and serves as the newest co- host of The Real.

Erika Jayne (US$5 million)

The singer and Broadway performer has had a rough patch since her divorce from lawyer husband Tom Girardi last year. According to Celebrity Net Worth Jayne has a reported net worth of US$5 million thanks to her music career and the US$500000 salary per season on the show. Moreover the 49-year-old diva is still banking on endorsement deals as she was recently featured on Rihanna’s Savage X Fenty Show Vol. 2.

Sutton Stracke (US$2 million)

The Southern belle housewife definitely has some wealth to flaunt considering her love for couture dresses and expansive mansions (she recently bought a US$5.4 million Bel-Air property). According to Cheatsheet Stracke has a reported net worth of US$2 million after her divorce from mysterious and wealthy ex-husband Christian Stracke. Apart from that Sutton is also a top party planner and owns a fashion boutique called The Sutton Concept in West Hollywood.

Crystal Kung Minkoff (up to US$10 million)

Newbie cast member (and the show’s first Asian-American)  Crystal doesn’t have an official net worth yet. However according to exactnetwealth.com her combined wealth with husband director Rob Minkoff could be up to US$10 million thanks to his successful career as a Hollywood director for films like The Lion King. The 35-year- old is also an entrepreneur with Real Coco a coconut-based company that sells coconut milk water coffee creamer and chips.

""If you are vaccinated you're protected and you can enjoy your Memorial Day"" said Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky on Wednesday. ""If you're not vaccinated our guidance has not changed for you. You remain at risk of infection. You still need to mask and take other precautions.""

The federal holiday which commemorates military personnel who died in service is seen as the unofficial start to summer and grilling season.

According to the Hearth Patio & Barbecue Association 56% of grill owners plan to fire up the grill this weekend. The Fourth of July is the most popular grilling day with 68% planning to barbecue.

Memorial Day travel:Yes airports will be mobbed. No masks aren't optional. What to know about summer flights

Dealing with raw meat can be tricky and cooking it improperly can be deadly.

""Cooking food thoroughly and handling it correctly is critically important"" Carmen Rottenberg a former administrator with the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service previously told USA TODAY. ""The food produced is not sterile. ... People want to cook raw food and prepare it at home. If you prepare it at home you have to know there are some risks associated with it.""

When grilling raw meat there are multiple steps you can take to avoid getting food poisoning especially with E. coli which can cause dehydration bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps three to four days after exposure – and potentially kidney failure in children under 5 years old and in older adults the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.

“Memorial Day marks the beginning of warmer weather and summer fun” Sandra Eskin USDA’s Deputy Under Secretary for Food Safety said in a news release. “Don’t let foodborne illness ruin the cookout – follow food safety guidelines like washing your hands thoroughly cooking your food and checking food temperature with a thermometer.""

Grilling safety tips for your Memorial Day 2021 cookout

Cook meats to a safe temperature. Use a food thermometer to check that your burgers or steaks have been cooked to a temperature that will help prevent foodborne illnesses from bacteria such as E. coli. Ground beef and pork should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 160°F (70˚C). Steaks and roasts should be cooked to at least 145°F (62.6˚C) and allow to rest for three minutes after removal from the grill. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has a chart showing the safe cooking temperatures for foods.

Marinated no-no. Don't reuse marinades that have been used with raw meat.

For kabobs keep meat and vegetables separate. Put peppers onions and carrots on separate sticks because veggies cook faster than the meat and you don't want your meat undercooked.

Don't use the same plates or utensils. Whatever dish you bring the meats to the grill on should not be used to take them up unless it's cleaned thoroughly. That's because bacteria from the raw meat can spread to the cooked meat. Have a clean plate or platter and clean utensils to take up food.

Practice cleanliness. You should wash your hands after preparing meats. Also wash your kitchen counter cutting boards and utensils after they are used on raw meats.

Beyond meat. Keep chilled certain salads or desserts that were served cold. After being served cold dishes should not stay outside for more than two hours – and just one hour if it is warmer than 90 degrees outside. Beyond that toss it.

Special attention needed. Some are more likely to succumb to food poisoning from E. coli; children and newborns pregnant women the elderly and those with weak immune systems are among those more susceptible.

It’s a joy to return my cart here in Arizona.”

Now he returns his carts not to the corral but the store.

Dozens of readers responded when I asked if what we do with our shopping carts says something about who we are.

Barbara Philipps almost never returns her cart but she takes a cart from the parking lot into the store. “Do I get points for that?” she wrote.

J.A. Hostetler grabs a cart in the parking lot for self-preservation. “I figure no one will risk damaging their car by hitting me and the cart” Hostetler wrote.

Abandoned carts are Steve McDermott’s pet peeve dating to when he was a teen working at a grocer and rounded them up.

He and his wife bicycle in Europe where stores charge to use carts. Shoppers in London pay to unlock carts. They get their money back when they return it.

“Needless to say” McDermott wrote “you don’t see too many carts strewn around the parking lot.”

While living in Nashville Tennessee Mike McKee read a newspaper story about damage caused by out-of-control carts in the hilly city. He thought it was funny until a runaway cart almost took him out.

Store employees weighed in asking not to be identified. They noted the rudest customers also don't return carts. Customers who use disabled parking spots often return theirs.

Abandoning carts doesn’t provide job security as some argue. They have plenty to do.

Until Kayleen Hunsaker had a knee replacement it hurt to walk that extra distance.

“I have always said that what you do in private when no one is looking is what determines your character” she wrote “but I also don’t feel that I need to judge anyone because I have absolutely no clue what is going on in their lives.”

In spite of the presence of key players such as Honeywell Flour Mills Crown Flour Mill Limited Dangote Flour Mills Flour Mills of Nigeria (FMN) Plc and Life Flour Mill Ltd the opportunities are still there waiting to be tapped.

For instance while the flour industry in Nigeria puts the value of Nigeria’s 3.2 million-tonne flour market at $2 million the growth is put at 3.5 per cent a year. Similarly while the United States Department of Agriculture Attaché Forecast estimated that Nigeria’s 2018-19 imports of wheat was at 5.4 million tonnes the domestic production stood around 60000 tonnes. The bitter truth therefore is that the industry which is dependent on imported wheat as its main ingredient for flour could do much better with the backward integrated policy.

With downstream food products such as bread pasta noodles and biscuits in addition to the demand for the principal products of the milling industry including bread flour pasta flour noodle flour confectionery flour and semolina the market is wide and attractive.

And that is precisely what Kings Flour Mill located at Onna in Akwa-Ibom State is here to do as part of its mandate to make the difference. Precisely in August 2019 it was already producing 500 metric tons per day. So with the onslaught of the debilitating COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 the millwhich produces the best flour for all types of baking as well as wheat offals for animals as feed was on hand to curb the scarcity of high quality flour in the county.

According to Prince Bassey Inwang chairman of the Akwa Ibom State branch of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN) the coming into the industry of Kings Flour Mill has opened another window for the farmers to go into the local production of wheat being the major raw materials for the mill. With AFAN in the state having already acquired two hectares of farmland in Ibiono Ibom local government area of the state they farmers have embarked on the cultivation of wheat under a pilot scheme.

What is important and imperative is for the project to be seen to its logical conclusion. In fact experts on agricultural insist that wheat can be effectively cultivated in Akwa Ibom if it is taken seriously. The experts posited that such cultivators could attract billions of Naira as key suppliers to Kings Flour Mill. That is where government’s provision of an enabling industrial environment and incentives come into play.

Good enough that the far-sighted Governor Udom Emmanuel has virtually turned the oil-rich state into Nigeria’s new industrial hub. Thestate with 6.5 million people is now home to a syringe manufacturing factory said to be the largest in Africa a meter manufacturing company described by the Nigerian Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as an “exceedingly important project” and a fertilizer blending plant.

With more than 10 large and small scale industries located in various parts of the state the coming of King Flour mill has added the much-needed economic drive.One of the privately owned companies is Udonwa-owned Norfin Offshore Ltd constructing a ship-building yard in Oruk-Anam Local Government Area of the state.The company is investing an initial capital of $5million in the project. The firm is planning to build supply-vessels for oil platforms tugboats batches ocean fishing boats and ferries for both Nigerian and foreign markets.

It is therefore understandable why the Chief Executive Officer of Kings Flour Mill at Onna Onur Kumral has identified Governor Udom Emmanuel’s industrialisation policy and the peace identified to the state as major catalysts that have attracted numerous investments in the last couple of years. Speaking while conducting the commencement of test run of the flour mill a few years ago Onur said he and other investors were able to come to AkwaIbom because the governor had formulated a framework to partner with private investors to bring their investments into the state.

“Governor Udom Emmanuel is the one that was executing the procedures and policies. That’s why investors like me are here you cannot take it like 100 percent private investment you have to take it like a coalition between the government and the private companies. It is instructive to note the factors that have facilitated the smooth take-off of the flour mill.

One of such is the location in the Onna industrial corridor which also host the jubilee syringe manufacturing company the metering solutions manufacturing company and the Ibom integrated farms. The other factor is that it has excellent network of roads and is just about 10km from the Ibom power plant. Significant also is its closeness to the sea port.

It should be noted that Kings Flour Mills’ foray into Nigeria’s industry came in 2019 when the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) reported that 800 companies shut their doors. That explains why people are celebrating the giant strides taken by the Gov. Emmanuel-led administration for fully supporting the industrial revolution.

Moving forward KFM should continue to apply the most modern technology in its processes and operations. These include ABC machinery built for many wheat flour mill plants across the world including New Zealand Nigeria Algeria Russia Uzbekstanand Pakistan to expand their wheat flour manufacturing business in flour mill industry. Equipped with Flour Milling MachineFan Classifying Screen Rotoscalper Reel Combination Sift and Scourer and Destoner Destine and Wheat Washer Pipes Cabinet their products will continue to meet internationally accepted standards as enforced by both the Standards Organization of Nigeria(SON) and NAFDAC.

With regards to the marketing of its products the Head of Sales Kings Flour Mill Frank Agaba insists that: “Our distribution is open to those who are interested to do business with us”.

The lessons for Nigeria include the facts that governors of other states should identify their areas of core competence as it concerns the available natural endowments and provide the enabling environment for the investors to thrive. The need to revive the near comatose manufacturing sector will act as catalyst for job and wealth creation and self-reliance. The time to begin to process what we have and export is now.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

‘PANDEMIC BOOST’: An HP executive said that higher prices for memory chips and displays and the effect on demand are issues that are going to be around for a while

Bloomberg





Dell Technologies Inc and HP Inc on Thursday reported revenue and earnings that showed consumers and companies continue to buy personal computers even as COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns ease in some parts of the world.

The strong results did not help the stocks which declined in extended trading.

Round Rock Texas-based Dell said that fiscal first-quarter sales rose 12 percent to US$24.5 billion compared with analysts’ average estimate of US$23.3 billion data compiled by Bloomberg showed.

HP reported revenue in its fiscal second quarter jumped 27 percent to US$15.9 billion also topping estimates by US$1 billion. It also raised its annual profit target.

Despite the positive numbers some investors are betting that PC growth is peaking and will not accelerate further Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross said.

Dell shares fell about 1 percent and HP dropped more than 6 percent in extended trading following the reports.

HP has experienced a surge in demand for laptops needed by people working and going to school remotely during the pandemic and those sales are persisting chief executive officer Enrique Lores said.

The drag on the company’s performance is a continuing shortage of computer chips which means HP cannot match supply to the demand for its products Lores said.

That situation will persist until the end of this year he said.

Dell executives echoed the concern about chips predicting component supply constraints will continue into next year.

The company will price into its products the higher costs of memory chips and displays while watching the impact that might have on demand for computers HP chief financial officer Tom Sweet said.

“These are things we’re going to have to navigate through and they’ll be with us for a while” Sweet said in an interview. “In the long term we’re very optimistic about this space. If the pandemic did anything it accelerated customers’ thinking that they need to invest in technology.”

Revenue in the second quarter typically increases about 6 percent sequentially but will likely fall short of that this year Sweet said.

HP’s PC-related sales rose 27 percent in the three-month period which ended on April 30.

Dell reported a 20 percent revenue increase at its laptop and desktop unit.

Palo Alto California-based HP said that notebook sales surged 47 percent from the same period a year earlier.

HP’s printer business had suffered from weak demand in the lockdown as companies held off on purchases of gear not needed in empty offices.

However printing and supplies revenue rebounded strongly in the quarter helped by more companies reopening their offices and stocking up again.

Margins were hurt by increasing costs HP chief financial officer Marie Myers said.

“We do expect revenue to be driven by available supply rather than demand” Myers said.

“Components and logistics costs are headwinds” she said.

While Dell chief executive officer Michael Dell is trying to reduce the reliance of his company on one-time hardware sales in favor of subscription-based computer services PC purchases still generate about half of revenue.

Sales from consumer PCs rose 42 percent to US$3.5 billion in the quarter the company said.

That compares with a 19 percent expansion in the prior period.

PC sales to business and government agencies were up 14 percent to US$9.8 billion.

Server and networking sales rose 9 percent to US$4.1 billion from a year earlier.

Storage hardware revenue was US$3.8 billion.

Services revenue rose 10 percent in the quarter to US$6.45 billion.

Sales from VMware Inc which is majority-owned by Dell were US$3 billion up 9 percent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHRvcG1hZy5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9ocC1lbnZ5LXgzNjAtMTUtcmV2aWV30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP Envy x360 15 review,"With speedy performance a sturdy build and all-day battery life the Envy x360 proves you don’t have to spend a bundle to get a good 2-in-1 laptop.

The HP Envy x360 Convertible 15-inch is an ultra-thin slab of stylish all-metal goodness that’s highly portable with spry performance that I’ve grown fond of. The AMD Ryzen-powered convertible is similar to previous models but with improved performance thanks to the updated AMD Ryzen 7 5700U processor and Radeon Graphics.

Upon first glance the Envy’s styling will be familiar to HP users as the angular tight sturdy design is now in use in everything from the Envy 13 to the HP ZBook Studio laptops and admittedly it’s a favorite of mine. So I took this energetic charcoal hybrid out for an adventure to see how it would handle my daily routine.

HP Envy x360 15 design

The ultra-thin charcoal gray slate styling of the HP Envy x360 is one of my faves as it feels like it’s ready for heroic action. Its angular lines make me think of The Falcon’s drone Redwing just brimming with potential prepared to take action but in stealth mode due to its dark grey coloring.

When opening the Envy the hinges provided firm resistance an excellent sign of solidly constructed hinges which you want in a 2-in-1. Opening the lid allows your eyes to meet the lovely backlit Chiclet-style keyboard. On either side of the keyboard are two Bang & Olufsen tuned speakers and beneath the keyboard is an amply-sized touchpad. The fingerprint reader is to the right of the alt key.

Measuring 14.13 x 9.96 x 0.68-inches and weighing 4.1 pounds it the heaviest of the three members of its group which includes the Dell Latitude 7320 2-in-1 (3.1 pounds 12.1 x 7.9 x 0.7 inches) and the Microsoft Surface Pro 7+ (1.8 pounds 11.5 x 7.9 x 0.3 inches).

HP Envy x360 15 security

The HP Envy x360 offers security and privacy features starting with Windows Hello’s facial recognition in conjunction with the IR webcam and proximity sensor to lock unwanted individuals and wake up when the user returns. There is also a fingerprint reader for extra security and a shutter button to block out the webcam.

HP Envy x360 15 ports

The HP Envy x360 arrives with a fair amount of ports for its size. You’ll find a USB-Type A port an SD card slot and an AC power port on the right.

We find another USB-A port an HDMI port a USB-C port and a 3.5 audio jack on the left.

HP Envy x360 15 display

The HP Envy x360 15-inch 1080p FHD touch display produces images and video nicely with rich color saturation delivering solid brightness and contrast. When I'm feeling a bit down I enjoy watching Iron Man on Disney Plus as it’s my favorite. The scene where Robert Downey Jr. is off playing in the casino while they're showing a video of Stark's accomplishments as Rhode is about to accept his apogee award is hilarious and was rendered nicely by the Envy’s display.

(Image credit: Future)

During another scene Tony finally adorns the Iron Man armor and flies off to the Gulmira to destroy his weapons. We see his face right before his helmet closes and it just sets the mood.

(Image credit: Future)

The Envy’s display warmly produced the red and gold of his armor when we first see him raises his arms to use his repulsors and his palms light up.

Lastly when Iron Man has been knocked out of the sky and he comes crashing down stands up slowly then turns to blow up the tank with one single missile and slow walks away as if to say ""not on my watch"" the Envy x360’s screen never disappointed as it rendered each moment crisply with excellent saturation.

(Image credit: Future)

When we measured the screen's color reproduction capabilities the Envy x360 scored 77% on our DCI-P3 color gamut test falling below the premium laptop average of 85.2%. However it was still first in its group. The Surface Pro 7+ scored 75.5% and the Dell Latitude 7320 led our group with a score of 83.3%.

The HP Envy x360 has an average brightness of 338 nits short of the 392-nit average. The Surface Pro 7+ was the group’s star with 358 nits and the Latitude rounded us out with 260 nits.

I have a major pet peeve with 2-in-1 makers including HP. The touchscreen display is highly responsive and accurate but I’m disappointed that it doesn’t come with a stylus. It seems like a wasted opportunity especially at this price point. It is a significant swing and miss for HP but also for many other makers. Many Chromebooks which are much cheaper come with a stylus; even a simple stylus would be better than just not including one at all.

HP Envy x360 15 audio

The HP Envy x360’s Bang & Olufsen tuned speakers produced louder audio than I expected. I never expect a bass-thumping experience in this form factor and that holds true for the Envy. However they were loud enough to enjoy watching a video and listen to music in our studio apartment.

(Image credit: Future)

While listening to Bruno Mars’ “That’s What I Like” his voice was crystal clear with solid range and timbre. Bruno’s occasional falsetto was crisp and sweet. The bass is alright but as expected lacked thump. However the speakers are meant for meetings and casual use not to throw an impromptu rave.

While watching Iron Man the machine-gun fire was accurate; his repulsors had that nice whine followed by the blast; explosions sounded full enough and the vocals were clear. Overall the Envy produces solid quality audio but wireless headphones would be best if you want to experience more robust sound.

HP Envy x360 15 keyboard and touchpad

The Envy x360’s keyboard is a joy to type on even with my giant Shrek-like hands. The travel on the clicky backlit keyboard is excellent. Typing was a pleasure. I found it refreshing for such a small tightly built convertible.

I scored a shocking 96 words per minute with 95% accuracy on the 10fastfingers test. My usual wpm average is between 70% and 85%.

The 5 x 3.8-inch touchpad on the Envy is massive and does a great job of executing Windows 10 gestures  including three or four-fingered swipes and simple finger taps. The bottom corners of the touchpad are super clicky and responsive.

HP Envy x360 15 performance

With its AMD Ryzen 7 5700U processor 16GB of RAM  and 512GB PCIe SSD  the Envy x360 performed well during most tasks. I pushed it to the brink on some workloads including opening 40 Google Chrome tabs a few of them running videos and editing in Google Docs without experiencing any hiccups.

During our synthetic benchmark tests the Envy x360 was the victor of our group with a score of 6852 during the Geekbench 5.3 overall performance test. It performed above the 4430 premium laptop average. The Latitude 7320 came in second at 5292 with the Surface Pro 7+ (Intel Core i5-1135G7 CPU) placing third with 4825.

The HP Envy x360 took 8 minutes to convert a 4K video to 1080p on the Handbrake test. It blew away the 16:31 average. The Latitude 7320 took 17 minutes and 16 seconds placing second while the Surface Pro dragged its feet with a time of 23:41.

During our File Transfer test the Envy scored 570.5 megabytes per second while transferring 25GB of mixed media which is below the premium laptop average of 635.3MBps. The Surface Pro 7+'s 256GB SSD hit 348.3 MBps followed by the Latitude's 512SSD.

The Envy x360 lasted 11 hours and 23 minutes during the Laptop Mag Battery Test  which consists of continuous web surfing over Wi-Fi at 150 nits of brightness. That time is above the 10:17 premium laptop average. The Latitude clocked in at a whopping 12:01 while the Surface Pro 7+ barely finished the workday at 8:49.

HP Envy x360 15 heat

The HP Envy x360 is a chilly customer day or night. During our heat test (15 minutes of playing a fullscreen HD video) the touchpad measured 78.5 degrees Fahrenheit with the center of the keyboard measuring in at 83 degrees. The laptop’s undercarriage reached 84.5 degrees which is below our 95-degree comfort threshold.

The 720p IR webcam on the HP Envy x360 is par for the course for integrated webcams. The colors in my test shots came out nicely saturated especially my tawny complexion. Details were sharp capturing minute aspects of my beard and facial features. The most remarkable part about the webcam is the shutter button located to the left of the power button. With one simple press you can make sure your privacy is kept secret.

Overall the webcam delivers solid performance during video conferencing but if you want a higher resolution shooter check out our best webcams page .

HP Envy x360 15 software and warranty

The HP Envy x360 takes a minimalist approach to bloatware  and you mostly find the standard Windows 10 OS holdover such as Xbox Console Companion and Xbox Game bar as well as Skype.

Some proprietary HP applications like the HP Command Center allow you some intimate access to things like boosting your network speed. HP’s enhanced lighting app creates a ring light on the screen that helps illuminate your face during video conferencing and is highly adjustable.

Lastly my favorite HP app is Quickdrop; it allows you to transfer files from your phone to your laptop instantly and is one of the most user-friendly apps you can use.

The HP Envy x360 15 comes with a one-year warranty with 90 days of phone support. See how HP fared during Tech Support Showdown and Best and Worst Brands  our annual special reports.

Bottom line

The HP Envy x360 15 is a solid choice that offers peppy performance and is handy for mobile professionals or college students who need something relatively lightweight. Thanks to its AMD Ryzen 7 5700U processor the Envy can handle most of your work and entertainment needs. Also the notebook has some excellent security features to ensure your essential data remains safe.

Starting at just $769 (our review unit cost $999) the HP Envy x360 15 offers good specs and performance for the price. It is far less expensive than the Dell Latitude 7320 (starting price $1569) or the Surface Pro 7+ ($1486). However the lack of a stylus is frustrating.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9ocC1lbnZ5LTE0LTIwMjEtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP Envy 14 2021 Review: Great Laptop But Tread Lightly,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site.

HP Envy 14 (2021) review: Great laptop but tread lightly MSRP $1250.00 Score Details “The HP Envy 14 lacks a brilliant display but makes up for it with impressive performance.” Pros Excellent productivity performance

Solid build quality

Conservative good looks

Good entry-level gaming

Superior keyboard and touchpad Cons Display is subpar for the intended creative market

A little thick and heavy for the class

Media battery life is underwhelming

HP’s Envy laptops have morphed from midrange offerings into what the company intends as the most attractive machines for creative types. The Envy 15 for example is a powerful laptop with a color-accurate OLED display that competes well against other 15-inch laptops in terms of performance and particularly price. Now HP has reintroduced its HP Envy 14 form factor with a new machine that leverages Intel’s 11th-gen Tiger Lake CPUs and discrete Nvidia graphics — all in a chassis that’s a bit smaller than its larger sibling.

I reviewed an $1150 Envy 14 configuration with the Core i5-1135G7 CPU 16GB of RAM a 256GB solid-state drive (SSD) a 14-inch WUXGA (1920 x 1200) IPS display in a more productivity-friendly 16:10 aspect ratio and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Max-Q GPU.

That’s a premium price for the configuration proving that the Envy 14 is intended to compete with the very best laptops you can buy. But does it offer the performance and display quality that creative users crave?

Design

The Envy 14 is constructed of stamped aluminum which is one difference from the CNC-machined Spectre line. The latter is a bit more robust in its build quality with the Envy 14 demonstrating just a touch of bending in the lid and flexing in the keyboard deck. It’s a solid build just not up there with the likes of the HP Spectre x360 14 or other premium laptops like the Dell XPS 13.

The MSI Prestige 14 Evo is another 14-inch clamshell laptop that feels about the same as the Envy 14 — solid but not quite top-notch. Note that the Prestige 14 Evo is also a couple of hundred dollars less than the HP with a Core i7 and 1TB SSD. Finally I’ll mention the Porsche Design Acer Book RS which mixes carbon fiber and metal for a more solid feel.

Aesthetically HP was going for a minimalist design with the Envy 14 and it succeeded. Unlike the gem-cut and multicolored Spectre x360 14 the Envy 14 is a matte silver color with an uncluttered appearance and simple lines. It’s attractive enough but doesn’t stand out. The MSI Prestige 14 Evo is also more aggressive in its styling and coloring but I find the Envy 14 strikes a nice balance.

It’s a lot like Lenovo’s Yoga 9i in this respect — a design that’s not meant to draw attention to itself but won’t embarrass you no matter the environment. If you want a 14-inch clamshell to show off the Porsche Design Acer Book RS has by far the most aggressive styling.

The Envy 14 is a bit stouter than much of its 14-inch competition. Its chassis is reasonably sized thanks to an 88% screen-to-body ratio and small bezels all around except for the chin which is only slightly larger than the current trend. But it’s a bit thicker at 0.71 inches and heavier at 3.3 pounds. The Prestige 14 Evo for example is 0.63 inches thick and weighs 2.85 pounds while the Acer Swift 5 is 0.59 inches and 2.31 pounds.

Those laptops don’t have the option for discrete graphics however and can give up internal space for keeping things cool. The Envy 14 also looks a bit thicker thanks to a rear leg that props up the keyboard and adds additional space underneath for better airflow.

Connectivity is a real strength with a USB-A 3.1 port full-size HDMI 2.0 port USB4 Type-C port with Thunderbolt 4 support and a 3.5mm audio jack along the left-hand side and another USB-A 3.1 port and a microSD card reader on the right-hand side. Wireless connectivity is handled by Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1.

Performance

Unlike the larger Envy 15 that sports a 45-watt Intel CPU the Envy 14 features an Intel 11th-generation Tiger Lack Core i5-1135G7 processor. We’ve found that to be a quick option in the U-series nearly as fast in many cases as Intel’s Core i7 that’s clocked just a bit faster.

The Envy 14 lives up to the CPU’s promise. As you can see in the table below it doesn’t excel in Geekbench 5 but it’s more competitive in our other tests. HP offers its Command Center software that lets you tune the CPU for fan noise and heat versus full-on performance but it doesn’t make as much of a difference in the Envy 14 as it does in the Envy 15 and Spectre x360 14 as two examples. The Spectre x360 14 in particular makes good use of the utility — it’s quite fast in Performance mode while very quiet and much slower in Balanced mode. All of the Envy 14 results listed here are with the utility set at Balanced.

Across the board the Envy 14 performs admirably even against the Core i7 competition. In our Handbrake test that encodes a 420MB file to H.265 the Envy 14 was in line with all but the Prestige 14 Evo and the Ryzen 7 5800U-based Asus ZenBook 13 that blew away its Intel competition. In performance mode the Envy 14 was in third place among this group.

In Cinebench R23 the results were similar with the Prestige 14 Evo and the Zenbook 13 leading the pack. Note that the Envy 14 scored an even more competitive 6073 in the Cinebench multi-core test in performance mode. In the PCMark 10 Complete test the Envy 14 came in second place in the overall score. It also did well in the Productivity and Content Creation portions of the test while falling behind in the Essentials portion.

Overall the Envy 14 was a solid performer in our benchmarks and it felt that way while I was using it during the review. It’s a speedy machine for all the productivity tasks you’ll want to throw at it and it does as well in creative applications as any other Tiger Lake laptop. It can’t keep up with AMD’s Ryzen CPUs in processor-intensive tasks but that’s where the discrete GPU comes into play.

If you’re using an application that can take advantage of the GPU then the GTX 1650 Ti Max-Q — a rarity in the 14-inch class — makes a real difference. HP configured the GPU with Nvidia’s Studio platform drivers which provide better performance and reliability in certain popular creative applications.

For example I ran the PugetBench benchmark that runs through a series of intensive tasks in Premiere Pro — an application that makes efficient use of a GPU. The Envy 14 did quite well for a U-series machine scoring 432 to embarrass the ZenBook 13’s 180 and the MacBook Air M1’s 320. It couldn’t keep up with laptops powered by Intel’s 45-watt CPUs and faster GPUs but it did well based on its components. In fact it beat out the HP Spectre x360 15 that scored 339 with its Core i7-10750H and GTX 1650 Ti.

The Envy 14 is also a decent entry-level gaming laptop for anyone who wants a little break from work. It led the pack in the 3DMark Time Spy test doubling up the Intel Iris Xe-based competition. It also performed decently in Fortnite hitting 49 frames per second (fps) at 1080p and high graphics (57 fps in Performance mode) where the rest of the Tiger Lake class runs around 30 fps.

With epic graphics enabled the Envy 14 hit 39 fps (40 fps in Performance mode) still quite playable and much faster than the Tiger Lake average of around 22 fps. You won’t run modern titles with graphical details turned up but tune things down a little and most titles will be playable.

Display

Creative professionals want displays with wide color gamuts and accurate colors to go along with a high brightness level and excellent contrast. Does the Envy 14’s productivity-friendly 16:10 display stack up as well as its design and performance?

In a word no. It’s a bright display at 371 nits well above our 300-nit threshold. But it covers just 70% of AdobeRGB and 94% of sRGB slightly below average for premium and near-premium laptops and well below average for displays intended for creative types. None of the 14-inch laptops I’ve discussed in this review are much better — the MSI Prestige 14 Evo and Porsche Design Acer Base RS both came in at 73% of AdobeRGB and 97% of sRGB for example so just slightly higher.

The Envy 14’s color accuracy was good at 1.28 (1.0 or less is considered excellent). The Prestige 14 Evo hit 1.3 and the Porsche Design Acer Base RS was at 1.15. These better than average results and closer to the professional level.

The contrast was another weak spot for the Envy 14 which achieved a ratio of just 880:1. We like to see premium displays at 1000:1 or higher which the MSI and the Acer both nearly achieved at 970:1 and 940:1 respectively.

In truth the Envy 14’s display would be barely acceptable as a premium productivity display. It certainly doesn’t live up to the standards desired by creators unlike the OLED display on the Envy 15 that managed 97% of Adobe RGB 100% of sRGB a 404410:1 contrast ratio (to be fair that’s typical for OLED displays and no IPS panel will ever come close) and a DeltaE of 0.73.

If the Envy 14 has a weakness regarding its target market this display would be it. And it’s an important one — anybody wanting to buy this laptop for photo or video editing should keep these results in mind.

Keyboard and touchpad

The Envy 14 inherited a similar keyboard to the one found in HP’s Spectre line — and that’s a good thing. There’s plenty of spacing between the square keys and the switches are light and precise with a comfortable bottoming action. The lettering is attractive and legible in good lighting and the two-level backlighting is effective and consistent. This is one of the better keyboards around rivaling Dell’s XPS 13 and only slightly falling behind Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard on its MacBook line.

The touchpad is also excellent benefitting from the larger keyboard deck thanks to the taller 16:10 display. The touchpad is a Microsoft Precision version of course and so it’s responsive and precise. The buttons click solidly but without too much noise which is a plus. There’s also an equally responsive touch display and I appreciated it during my testing.

A fingerprint reader provides windows 10 Hello support on the keyboard and replaces the right control button. I’m not a fan of that placement having run into at least one application with a hard-coded use for the right control button but the fingerprint reader was accurate and fast in my testing.

Additional security and privacy are provided by a function key that controls a physical shutter for the webcam and a dedicated button to turn off the microphone. These are small touches that are appreciated for those times when you don’t want your webcam showing off your messy office — or worse being hacked and used to spy on you.

Battery life

The Envy 14 packs a 63 watt-hour battery which frankly is smaller than I expected. The Spectre x360 14 a much smaller laptop managed to fit in 67 watt-hours. Even so I was expecting better longevity out of the Envy 14 thanks to its lower-resolution 1920 x 1200 IPS display compared to the Spectre’s 3000 x 2000 OLED panel.

As it turns out my expectations were met. The Envy 14 achieved just over 12.5 hours on our web browsing test that loops through a series of popular websites. That’s a strong score that beats out all the 14-inch competition I’ve mentioned by several hours and is in the upper echelon of all the laptops we’ve tested.

The Envy 14 wasn’t quite as strong in our video test that plays a Full HD Avengers trailer until the battery runs out. Here the HP managed 14.5 hours a good score but one that’s beat out by the MSI Prestige 14 Evo and the Porsche Design Acer Base RS. Usually we see a larger difference between the web and video tests with the latter typically being quite a bit longer.

Finally I ran the PCMark 10 Gaming battery test that stresses the CPU and GPU and the Envy 14 manages just under 1.5 hours. That’s at the low end of all the machines we’ve tested demonstrating that the Envy 14 is a real battery hog when it’s under load. Unfortunately the Envy 14 couldn’t complete the PCMark 10 Applications battery test which is the best indication of real-world productivity.

Overall I’d rate the Envy 14’s battery life as good for productivity work and not as good for media consumption. And certainly if you’re going to be pushing the CPU and GPU then you’ll want to carry your charger with you.

Our take

The Envy 14 is a well-built good-looking 14-inch laptop with a fast Core i5 and a discrete GPU that’s unusual for a nongaming laptop of this size. That makes it a strong performer and in that sense a good option for the creative types that HP is aiming to please. Unfortunately its display is a bit subpar — it’s good enough for productivity users but not so much for creativity.

That makes the Envy 14 an interesting laptop to rate. It’s a solid offering for general users with good performance and productivity battery life a solid build and an excellent keyboard and touchpad. It may not meet the needs of the creative types that HP is aiming at but it’s a very good laptop for everyone else.

Are there any alternatives?

The MSI Prestige 14 Evo is a solid alternative to the Envy 14. It’s faster at CPU-intensive tasks has a better display and good battery life. It’s also quite a bit less expensive but of course you don’t get the fast GPU.

If a 2-in-1 is more your style then you’ll want to consider the HP Spectre x360 14. It’s faster when in performance mode it’s built and looks better and its OLED display meets the needs of photo and video editors in a way that the Envy 14 can’t.

As usual I’ll also offer up the Dell XPS 13 as an alternative. It’s smaller sure with its 13.4-inch 16:10 display but that display is slightly better and the Dell has a much better build quality.

How long will it last?

The Envy 14 is built well enough to last for years of productive service. The components are up to date and should keep up with the typical user’s demands for quite some time. The one-year warranty is disappointing but the industry standard.

Should you buy it?

Yes but not for photo or video editing if tons of accurate colors are required. The Envy 14 is a great productivity machine and should be judged as one rather than the creative powerhouse that HP positions it as.

A lack of adequate health insurance coverage and the complexities of navigating U.S. healthcare systems can cause a heavy financial burden as ELi has been hearing from readers in response to our reporting on the pandemic and disparities in health coverage.

Stories shared with ELi – from people including Michigan State University retirees working younger residents and others – show that East Lansing-area residents sometimes face unexpected curveballs and a system that makes it very hard to cope with medical expenses. Kris Green a bicyclist severely injured by a crash in East Lansing for example has had a fundraising campaign set up to help him cover his medical expenses.

ELi reported last year that while 95 percent of East Lansing residents have some form of health insurance not everyone has insurance that adequately covers needed emergency room visits imaging and medications. But more financial assistance may be available than some realize – including from the Sparrow and McLaren healthcare systems.

When MSU’s retiree insurance suddenly switched some were left worse off.

Retired MSU faculty and academic staff were involuntarily switched from insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield to Humana effective January 1 2021. MSU Spokesperson Emily Guerrant told ELi that the change occurred “to increase cost savings to the university and to expand programs and services for retirees.” Guerrant referred to free gym memberships and other offers to enrollees and said that Humana provides “comparable out-of-pocket costs” to retirees.

Alice Dreger for ELi Retired faculty and academic staff who once worked at MSU were involuntarily switched to a new insurance provider.

But some have found their out-of-pocket costs rise substantially following the switch. Sheila Teahan a professor in the MSU Department of English who retired in 2019 reached out to ELi to explain that she was already facing sizeable bills with her new plan as early as February 2021 just a month after the change.

She asked ELi to cover the story believing the change probably impacts many retirees negatively. For her health needs copays for most medicines have tripled Teahan told ELi and her glaucoma medication which cost her $10 a month under Blue Cross Blue Shield now costs her $80 a month out-of-pocket.

But most concerning Teahan told ELi is how Humana has repeatedly denied coverage of practitioners who are in-network claiming they were actually out-of-network. This significantly raises her costs.

Prior to the insurance switch Teahan told ELi that she had verified with all her providers that they would be in-network. Then bills started rolling in and Humana said some providers were out-of-network. The biggest challenge came with how Humana was covering costs related to her psychologist. Despite both her psychologist’s office and several Humana representatives saying her psychologist was in-network Humana repeatedly claimed he was out-of-network and therefore Humana refused to cover the cost.

Teahan believes that MSU retirees should not have been forced to find new practitioners to replace those they have developed relationships with sometimes over many years. She has seen her psychologist for about a decade and he has helped her navigate some of the most difficult periods of her life.

Teahan filed a grievance with Humana in April 2021 after Humana canceled coverage for her psychologist. An explanation of benefits provided by Humana had said that mental health care was covered completely after a $100 deductible. But Humana later told her that she lost her mental health care when MSU switched her insurance.

Humana initially denied the grievance in April 2021. In early May ELi asked MSU for comment on Teahan’s case.

In response MSU spokesperson Guerrant acknowledged that some retirees faced difficulties but said “Humana is willing to work with patients and their providers to bring services in-network to help them leverage their insurance coverage to the fullest which is what happened in Dr. Teahan’s case.”

When we shared Guerrant’s statement with her Teahan wrote to ELi “I’m not sure which is worse the large rise in health care costs or the unpaid part-time job dealing with Humana.”

But then suddenly in May Humana contacted Teahan to say it had changed its position on her case and is now billing her psychologist as in-network. Still Teahan remains apprehensive that everything is really settled citing conflicting and confusing wording in the letter she received.

When facing health crises or injuries estimating and managing costs can be nearly impossible some in East Lansing find.

Manasi Mishra told ELi about what happened after her husband broke his knee during the summer of 2017. The couple is originally from India and moved to Michigan to earn degrees at MSU. His injury was their first experience with healthcare in the U.S.

Mishra’s husband who wished not to be named in the article went to Sparrow Hospital’s emergency room after his accident where he received a cast and was told to contact an orthopedic surgeon as soon as possible. While the surgery was necessary the couple worried about what it would cost and tried to get an estimate from surgeons the hospital and Blue Cross Blue Shield. No one could provide any answers pointing to unknown variables like time to be spent in the surgery suite.

In the end the couple found themselves on the hook for approximately $1000 a considerable amount of money since they relied solely on the husband’s graduate student stipend from MSU. They turned to family in India to help them pay off the bill.

Mishra told ELi that smaller bills totaling about $500 slowly trickled in for over 6 months after the accident.

Ramya Swayamprakash is a doctoral candidate in the MSU Department of History.

East Lansing resident Ramya Swayamprakash who has had multiple surgeries and gave birth to her child while a graduate student at MSU also told ELi about a constant trickle of bills she has received for months after necessary medical care. Even for one hospital visit bills are issued from various departments so it is very difficult to know how much one has paid or might be charged in the upcoming months.

For international residents the healthcare economy can be confusing since other countries do not rely on private insurance and better estimate costs in advance. According to Guerrant MSU Human Resources can help both domestic and international students navigate their health insurance and noted that MSU’s Office for International Students and Scholars (OISS) also provides assistance.

But Mishra told ELi that while OISS offers information and sometimes even financial aid it is not reliable. She recounted meeting with a representative about the possibility of receiving aid to defray medical costs but in the end she found it difficult to receive responses from OISS.

Swayamprakash said she has learned to hold off on paying medical bills as soon as she receives them and to keep records of payments. She has noticed that requested payments sometimes drop a month or so after a bill is issued and that she is sometimes sent bills despite already having made a payment.

Options to defray or cover the cost of medical care are available to the financially vulnerable.

Many nonprofit hospitals including Sparrow and McLaren are legally required to have financial assistance programs.

Sparrow covers 100% of medically necessary care for those enrolled in the Ingham County Health Plan and those without insurance living under 200% of the federal poverty line. It also provides some discounts for the uninsured living over 200% of the federal poverty line and those with insurance facing large out-of-pocket costs.

If you have been treated in the Sparrow Health System (except services provided at Fast Care) you can apply for financial aid with this application. You will have to provide supporting documentation like recent paystubs and tax returns.

More information is available on Sparrow’s financial assistance page and its program explanation document.

Similarly McLaren offers financial aid for those who make up to 400% of the federal poverty line and received “emergency catastrophic and medically necessary services.”

Like Sparrow McLaren asks that individuals complete a form and submit supporting documentation regarding income. More information is available on its website.

For both make sure to submit paperwork as soon as possible since it can take time to gather documents and have your application reviewed.

Swayamprakash also brought the nonprofit “Dollar For” to ELi’s attention. Dollar For helps patients facing large bills receive financial aid from hospitals. The organization asks patients facing large medical bills to fill out an intake form on its website to see if they are eligible. If eligible Dollar For will help patients claim aid.

Tucked away in wooden crates closets and the large barn pieces of not only Medina's history but also the nation are once again seeing the light of day.

It's been a year or so since the Medina County Historical Society acquired the stately home not too far off the historic square where West Washington Street meets South Prospect Street.

Workers have spent months shoring up the 1890 Queen Anne-style home getting it ready to welcome its first public tours since the restoration in about a month.

Volunteers have been tasked with categorizing its contents and when necessary ensuring the items that range from furniture to clothes dating back to before the Civil War will be around for another century or more.

They have discovered a number of cool things along the way that not only tell the tales of the times but those of the home's occupants 130 years ago.

The home was built by Robert McDowell at a cost of $10900 back in the day.

McDowell was the president of the Old Phoenix Bank later FirstMerit and now part of Huntington Bank.

McDowell's wife Elizabeth was the daughter of H.G. Blake who was a state representative and a U.S. congressman.

The home remained in the family over five generations with many of the heirlooms turned over to the historical society for safekeeping when it purchased the home.

Among the items found was the Grand Army of the Republic uniform that belonged to McDowell.

Society President Brian Feron said McDowell — a Civil War veteran who joined the 2nd Ohio Volunteer Cavalry in Wayne County in 1862 — would wear the ceremonial uniform for parades and gatherings.

They found it in pristine condition — like the last day he wore it.

""His white gloves were still in the pocket"" Feron said. ""And in the breast pocket was the Medina Memorial Day program from May 30 1896. He died a year later.""

The uniform along with other items from the era will be on display inside of the home.

The home's collection is a hodgepodge of stuff from McDowell and also Blake whose families were merged by marriage.

Among the stranger finds were envelopes with lockets of hair from not only the children but also parents when they would pass away.

It may seem a bit odd now — particularly hair from a deceased person — but Feron said it was a pretty common practice in that era.

They even found watch chains made of hair that Elizabeth made for Robert when she married into the McDowell family.

Feron said they were able to figure of the origin of the unusual watch chains thanks to the extensive collection of letters and correspondence that were kept in wooden crates in the attic.

In one Elizabeth wrote about making the chains with each of their hairs as a token of love.

It is amazing it all survived not only the heat and chill of the attic but also a fire decades ago that damaged the home.

Feron said some of the boxes have charred lids from the heat of flames but the contents were left unsinged.

Some of the boxes contained papers and personal items from Blake's political career in Columbus and his time in Washington in the days leading up to the Civil War.

Many of the items are newspapers that look like they just rolled off the printing press.

One of particular note is the Nov. 20 1863 edition of the New York Tribune that notes a gathering that took place for the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg.

One has to read well into the article — some 12 long paragraphs in — where it is finally noted that Lincoln also gave a short address.

Feron said it is pretty amazing that such a now-famous speech was given so little ink at the time. But he did note that the reporter did say the speech was interrupted a couple of times.

""I've never heard anyone say there were pauses for applause during the Gettysburg Address"" he said. ""The fonts of these newspapers were so small I'm not sure how anyone back then had the eyesight to even read them.""

Volunteers are putting the finishing touches on the displays inside the home that range from restoring some rooms back to as close as they would have appeared back in the day to others that will house special exhibits that highlight the families and Medina County history.

The society has already raised about $530000 including a recent donation from Discount Drug Mart to finalize the purchase of the home make the necessary improvements — including installing central air — and pay for some restoration work.

Feron said the next $300000 phase will be to restore the barn on the property and make improvements like adding public rest rooms so the house can host larger community and private events.

But for now he said the fun work continues as volunteers continue to sort through the home's contents and find new items to display.

""It is just amazing the condition these things are in"" he said. ""Every day we are finding something new.

""This is just the tip of the iceberg.""

Cisco Systems (CSCO -0.44%) and International Business Machines (IBM -1.17%) faced challenges in recent times despite a storied history as tech icons. There's the coronavirus pandemic of course. But other factors such as the technology industry's shift to cloud computing forced Cisco and IBM to evolve in significant ways.

Both took different paths in this evolution experiencing success along the way. Compelling reasons exist to invest in each but is there a clear winner between the two?

Let's evaluate these tech titans to understand why one emerges as the better investment at this time.

Cisco's path forward

As part of its evolution in the era of cloud computing Cisco built up a suite of software products to reduce reliance on its computer networking hardware business. This proved a prescient move in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

Last year Cisco contended with supply chain challenges created by the pandemic. This constraint caused year-over-year revenue to drop by 5% in its 2020 fiscal year which ended July 25. The pandemic could have hurt revenue further if not for Cisco's software business. Its cybersecurity offerings saw fiscal 2020 revenue grow 12% year over year.

Cisco also invested in technology to support a slew of new growth opportunities. These include capabilities for 5G networks the Internet of Things and 400G which involves next-gen technology to address bandwidth demands and other technical challenges related to cloud computing.

These investments are paying off particularly as the pandemic's end draws closer in the United States. Revenue returned to an upward trajectory in Cisco's fiscal third quarter ended May 1 increasing 7% year over year to $12.8 billion.

That's just the start of its success. Cisco experienced 10% growth in third-quarter product orders. This was the strongest demand Cisco has seen since the 2012 fiscal year.

Cisco is not only relying on the latest technology trends to power revenue growth. The company moved its software products to a software-as-a-service subscription model which gives Cisco a reliable recurring revenue stream. Cisco has successfully navigated this transition. Its Q3 subscription revenue comprised 81% of software sales up from 76% the previous quarter.

The company is also bundling its products. This is a smart move. Any client purchasing networking hardware will also need Cisco's security solutions to protect from criminals hacking that network. Security is essential in the IT industry so it's no surprise Cisco saw Q3 revenue for its security products increase 13% year over year.

As the pandemic's impact recedes Cisco sees its business returning to revenue growth. The company expects fourth-quarter revenue to rise at least 6% year over year.

IBM's evolution

IBM is navigating its own challenges aside from the coronavirus pandemic. Big Blue is in the midst of a multi-year transformation. Its business suffered years of revenue declines as clients moved away from its on-premises technology offerings to cloud computing.

IBM has existed for over a century so it's well versed in adapting to the technology industry's changes. The company shifted its focus to cloud computing in recent years and these efforts have proven successful. IBM grew cloud-based income from just 4% of total revenue in 2013 to 34% in 2020.

IBM's cloud efforts led to total cloud revenue of $6.5 billion in the first quarter of this year a 21% year-over-year increase. Yet some of its legacy businesses weighed on IBM's cloud success.

The company's global technology services segment which helps clients implement IBM's solutions saw year-over-year revenue drop 1.5%. This division represents more than a third of IBM's total revenue bringing in $6.4 billion of Q1's $17.7 billion.

As part of IBM's strategy to focus on its cloud computing and artificial intelligence strengths it plans to spin off a portion of the operations under its global technology services division into a new company called Kyndryl. Kyndryl will help clients modernize IT infrastructures serving as a partner to IBM's offerings. The spinoff will happen by the end of this year.

The verdict

IBM's cloud success is appealing and once it separates out Kyndryl Big Blue's cloud business will benefit without Kyndryl's drag on earnings. But the value of owning shares in Kyndryl is murky. That's why I think it's best to wait on IBM shares until the Kyndryl spinoff. That way you can effectively evaluate whether you want to own a piece of this new company.

Meanwhile Cisco remains a market leader in its core networking business. Its Q3 results show the company is on an upward trajectory as the pandemic's impact starts to fade. Its investments in up-and-coming trends such as 5G provide years of revenue growth opportunity. These factors make Cisco the better investment right now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9wb3N0LW1hZ2F6aW5lL2xvbmctcmVhZHMvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTM1MDUzL3NoZS1tZW1vcmlzZWQtaWJtLXR5cGV3cml0ZXItY29kZXMtNTQwMC1jaGluZXNl0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20vbWFnYXppbmVzL3Bvc3QtbWFnYXppbmUvbG9uZy1yZWFkcy9hcnRpY2xlLzMxMzUwNTMvc2hlLW1lbW9yaXNlZC1pYm0tdHlwZXdyaXRlci1jb2Rlcy01NDAwLWNoaW5lc2U?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Even her incredible memory couldn’t save IBM’s Chinese typewriter,"The IBM Chinese typewriter was a formidable machine – not something just anyone could handle with the skill of the young typist in the film. On the keyboard affixed to the hulking gunmetal grey chassis 36 keys were divided into four banks: 0 to 5; 0 to 9; 0 to 9; and 0 to 9. With just these 36 keys the machine was capable of producing up to 5400 Chinese characters wielding a language that was infinitely more difficult to mechanise than English or other Western writing systems.

As I thought I had indeed encountered the typist in my research in glossy IBM brochures and on the cover of Chinese magazines. Who was she? Why did she appear so frequently so prominently in the history of IBM’s effort to electrify the Chinese language?

As soon as I saw that film I began to riffle through my files. I am a professor of Chinese history at Stanford University in the United States and I was years into a book project on the history of modern Chinese information technology and the Chinese typewriter specifically. By that point I had amassed a large and still-growing body of source materials  including archival documents photographs and even antique machines. My office was becoming something of a private museum.

I had seen this woman before. Many times now. I was certain of it. But who was she? In a film from 1947 she is operating an electric Chinese typewriter the first of its kind manufactured by IBM. Semi-circled by journalists and a nervous-looking middle-aged Chinese man – Kao Chung-chin the engineer who invented the machine – she radiates a smile as she pulls a sheet of paper from the device. Kao is biting his lip his eyes darting between the crowd and the typist.

To type a character one depressed four keys – one from each bank – more or less simultaneously compared by one observer to playing a chord on the piano. Just as the film explained “If you want to type word number 4862 you would press four-eight-six-two and the machine would type the right character.”

Each four-digit code corresponded with a character etched on a revolving drum inside the typewriter. Spinning at a speed of one revolution per second the drum measured 18cm in diameter and 28cm in length. Its surface was etched with 5400 Chinese characters letters of the English alphabet punctuation marks numerals and a handful of other symbols.

How was the typist in the film able to pull off such a remarkable feat of memory? Certainly there are a host of professionals who in the course of their daily work are able to wield an impressive array of codes – telegraph operators emergency responders court stenographers musicians police officers grocery store clerks. But none of them have to memorise thousands of ciphers or codes. This young woman was a virtuoso.

Excited to share the film with others I posted a brief write-up about it on a blog I used to run and that was that. One day however a comment appeared (a rare occurrence). “Thank You for the memories” it read. “I am the woman demonstrating the Chinese typewriter in the recent restored movie. If you’d like more info please contact me.”

My heart skipped a beat. Could this really be her? Or was it a scam concocted by a netizen with too much time on their hands? I had to respond but I proceeded with caution. In the postscript I included a shibboleth of sorts: a question which I knew from my research could be answered only by the original typist someone who knew her or someone who like me had spent years in Chinese archives and rare book collections.

Lois Lew responded – accurately.

My doubts evaporated replaced with excitement. I responded immediately eager to arrange a time to speak. I had so many questions. How did she become involved in the IBM project? What was her background? What was it like to use the machine? How did she memorise all of those codes?

But my email to Lew went without a response. I sent a polite follow-up email. Silence again. Finally the trail went entirely cold. I never learned why.

It would be another eight years before I reconnected with Lew this time thanks to a friend and former employee of hers. Like Lew he saw a blog entry of mine and reached out. Perhaps because I was vouchsafed thanks to my exchanges with her friend this time the conversation took place. And it was well worth the wait.

“You’ve been looking for me for 10 years” Lew said as soon as she answered my call. I could sense her smiling sending my thoughts back to the 1947 film.

It was true – in fact it was an understatement. When I first saw Lew I was 29 years old. On the phone with her I was 40.

She had travelled a far greater distance. In the IBM film she was a mere 22. On the phone she was 95.

I couldn’t believe I was finally talking to her.

I know how to dress. Very sexy looking. I was beautiful Lois Lew

When the IBM Chinese typewriter was debuted to the world Lew was a worker in Department 76 of Plant 3 of the IBM office in Rochester New York state.

Born Lois Eng on December 21 1924 in Troy New York her early life was marked by struggle political turmoil and near constant movement. Soon after she was born her family returned to China. When the Sino-Japanese war erupted in 1937 Lew’s family was forced to flee south largely on foot on a perilous trek from north China to Hong Kong. Along the way Lew recalled there were times when she had to carry a sibling on her back.

In Hong Kong her mother took notice of a family in the neighbourhood that struck her as financially stable. Engaging the help of a matchmaker she inquired as to whether any of the sons in the family were eligible bachelors. She provided a photograph of Lois and after some time received an answer in the affirmative.

Lois’ mother successfully matched three of her daughters this way one to a man in Chicago a second to a man in San Francisco and a third – Lois – to a man in Rochester. All of these men her mother was assured were well off and more than capable of supporting their brides-to-be.

At the age of 16 Lois ventured upon a transpacific voyage by herself disembarking at San Francisco and then taking a train (again by herself) to Chicago. Her soon-to-be brother-in-law greeted her there and accompanied her to Rochester. She could speak and understand barely a few words of English.

Lew appeared in materials such as IBM brochures. Photo: IBM

Upon her arrival in Rochester Lois learned the truth about her husband-to-be – a man named Yuen Lew – and his financial situation. Far from living a comfortable life Lew slept in the back room of his laundry shop along with his sister Gay.

Being too young to marry legally in the state of New York the couple travelled to New Jersey to get married. Lois Eng became Lois Lew. And while her new sister-in-law would go on to attend high school Lew was told that a married woman such as her did not do that kind of thing.

Lew and Gay were among just a handful of Chinese women in Rochester at the time a fact that counter-intuitively may have contributed to their being hired by nearby IBM.

“In those days you didn’t see many Chinese girls” Lew recounted to me in our conversation. “They would just use us for show: Chinese girls using an American typewriter.”

Lew became a capable typist as did Gay.

Then the IBM Chinese typewriter was unveiled to the world. Suddenly IBM – and above all the typewriter’s inventor Kao – needed to find Chinese-speaking typists to help present the prototype both in the US and in China. Lew and Gay were summoned to New York City to meet with Kao in person.

But then illness struck. Gay contracted tuberculosis and needed to be hospitalised – and so Lew made the journey as she had so many in her young life alone.

Renting a room at a local YWCA Lew hired a taxi and was shepherded to IBM’s world headquarters at 590 Madison Avenue. She stepped out of the cab gazed upwards at the 100000 sq ft 20-storey building and entered the lift to meet with Kao. ⁠

As Kao read over Lew’s résumé which exhibited nothing like an educational background he was visibly displeased. “Do you know how to spell the word ‘encyclopaedia’?” he asked.

It was peculiar insulting a kind of aggressive non sequitur. Lew knew immediately what Kao was after: he was testing her disappointed in her lack of formal education. But she also knew that Kao’s suspicions were correct: she did not know how to spell the word. Overcome and on the verge of tears Lew wanted to race back down to the street back to the Bronx back to the YWCA where she was renting a room and perhaps all the way back to Rochester.

“Do you want me to go home?” she asked.

Kao looked at her and then looked away. The room fell silent. His decision seemed to take a lifetime. Here Lew was an IBM plant worker with not even a high-school education who had already failed a basic spelling test in the opening moments of the interview.

What Lew could not have known at the time however was that Kao needed her far more than she needed him. Before Lew there had been another typist – another young woman named Grace Tong who Kao had hired to demonstrate the machine to journalists and executives. Tong was everything Kao had wanted in an assistant. She boasted a college education. Her husband Yanghu Tong was a talented engineer. What was more she was the daughter-in-law of Hollington Tong a respected Chinese diplomat and journalist.

But then Kao’s plans were dealt a major blow. For reasons unexplained by the archival record Grace Tong gave up on the job. One possibility holds that she may have fallen ill rendering her unable to accompany Kao and the machine on national and international tours. It is also possible that Tong’s professional life was being steadily consumed by familial expectations (she and her husband were expecting their second child around this time). Whatever the reason the fact remained: Kao was now in need of a replacement ideally one with all of the same traits as Tong.

For Kao Lew was far from the ideal. Even still she was Kao’s last best chance of winning over journalists and buyers as to the feasibility of his machine. If the world were to be convinced that his system was tenable – especially the coding system upon which it relied – it would be Lew’s job to convince them.

If she landed the job that was.

The question Lew had asked lingered in the room: do you want me to go home?

“No” Kao replied at last “There’s something else about you.” Kao paused and then sighed. “I have no choice. I have to try you.

“Take this chart” Kao instructed her. “Go back to your hotel and memorise the four-digit codes for 100 characters.”

Over the next few days Kao’s chart was Lew’s whole world. She knew she was on probation and everything depended on her ability to memorise this set of codes.

I could have bought IBM stock. Instead I bought war bonds. Stupid! Lois Lew looking back on her time at IBM

After her first stressful encounter with Kao Lew spent a week poring over the four-digit codes for the probationary set of characters. She succeeded and landed the job. And so began an unforeseen journey one that would take her across the US and back across the Pacific.

The probationary period gave way to the real training regimen. In the span of three weeks Lew would need to learn by heart – or more accurately by body – the four-digit codes for 1000 of the most commonly used Chinese characters. Each day she made the long commute from the Bronx to IBM’s offices.

The practice paid off. After completing the training Lew became Kao’s main demonstrator for the machine with shows held across Boston New York and San Francisco. The striking young Chinese woman made an impression.

“My fingernails were red” she recalls. “I had nylon stockings. They’d never seen anything like that.”

And then came the voyage to China.

The last time Lew had travelled by ship across the Pacific she had been a teenager all by herself fleeing Hong Kong and setting out to meet a husband-to-be whom she had seen only in photographs. This time she was a grown woman flanked by two IBM engineers and a Chinese inventor. All of her meals were paid for as was an entirely new wardrobe. She told me that she felt like she was living like a film star.

To say that Kao’s hopes were high for the China trip would be a vast understatement. They were stratospheric. As Kao’s son recounted to me the inventor converted an immense sum of money into yuan – possibly as much as US$250000 although this figure might be exaggerated. The cash filled an entire trunk. ⁠

With this enormous war chest Kao would try to secure contracts establish manufacturing arrange­ments and perhaps grease the skids a bit in a country that was racked by systemic corruption. This was likely the last chance to translate those long gruelling years into something that could make him as famous – in China at least – as Ottmar Mergenthaler Thomas Watson or even Johannes Gutenberg. Kao’s name his reputation and a small fortune were all riding on the trip – and on Lew’s performance.

In China the reception was thrilling. In Shanghai the mayor was waiting for them at the docks along with photographers. Lew and the team were treated to sumptuous meals and stayed in one of the best hotels in the city. The first of a series of demonstrations took place at the IBM China headquarters. The following day on October 20 1947 Kao and Lew demonstrated the machine at the Park Hotel then the tallest building in Asia. In attendance were scientists local government officials and newsmen.

In Nanjing the reception was even more stirring. The team was met by high-level government officials and the visit was covered extensively in the Chinese press. Even before the team’s arrival in China in fact the local media had been watching its American demonstrations from afar. For months Chinese outlets had been circulating news of Kao’s presentations across the US including those in San Francisco in Boston at Harvard University and elsewhere.

In preparation for the demonstration in Nanjing the city had arranged an immense auditorium and with good reason. An audience of 3000 people gathered to watch Kao the machine and Lew.

Many would have been overwhelmed by the pressure but not Lew. She had grown accustomed to the spot­light. New York Boston San Francisco at IBM – all of these experiences had seasoned her like a veteran Hollywood performer. In front of 3000 onlookers and a nervous Kao Lew was handed one newspaper article after another one letter after the next which she then was required to transcribe.

Kao and Lew were well prepared for this however. During her training Lew had been drilled in a variety of letters in different common styles. She knew them all by heart.

Coverage of Lew and Kao’s demonstrations in China was extensive and overwhelmingly positive. Stories appeared in Science Signs of the Times Municipal Affairs Weekly Science Pictorial Science Monthly and many other outlets. Publishers were clearly enamoured of Lew. Her face soon appeared in IBM promotional brochures and the 1947 film among other media.

“I know how to dress” Lew told me on the phone. “Very sexy looking. I was beautiful.”

For all the excitement over Kao’s invention as the 1940s drew to a close it became increasingly clear to him that his venture had failed. No matter the success of the Chinese tour and the American tour before it – and above all Lew’s stellar performance throughout – Kao simply could not convince the wider world that his coding system was practical.

American media cover­age of Kao’s typewriter did not help his cause. In a July 15 1946 article in Time magazine the opening paragraph said it all: “The Chinese have a practical reason for believing that one picture is worth a thousand words: it takes so long for them to write the words.”

In the end however it was geopolitics that would kill Kao’s project. “The Communist takeover in China was well under way at the time” a 1964 retrospective article explained “and was completed before the type­writer had a chance to achieve significant sales in an understandably nervous Chinese market.”

Not only did Mao Zedong’s victory in China push IBM’s anxieties to breaking point it also threw Kao’s national identity into turmoil. He became a man without a country being issued a special diplomatic “red” visa by the US. The IBM Chinese typewriter never made it to market leaving the challenge of electrifying and eventually computerising the Chinese language to later inventors in the second half of the 20th century.

For Lew life after IBM took her in a completely different direction. She and her husband started a laundromat and reinvested their savings along with earnings from IBM in the launch of Cathay Pagoda a Chinese restaurant in Rochester in 1968. Located just a two-minute walk from the famed 2400-seat Eastman Theatre the restaurant attracted not only a steady stream of students and young people but also the occasional movie star Katharine Hepburn among them. Cathay Pagoda closed in 2007.

Now in her 90s Lew swims at the YMCA once a week for three hours each visit. She loves to eat and remains close friends with former employees of her restaurant.

Looking back on her time at IBM she told me she has but one regret: “I could have bought IBM stock. Instead I bought war bonds. Stupid!”

“I still remember the numbers” she added in passing referring to the four-digit codes from the Chinese typewriter. She began to rattle them off to me on the telephone. “‘You’ zero-two-seven-five. ‘He’ zero-one-seven-eight. ‘Me’ zero-three-one-four.”

I couldn’t help but smile. Her vivacity and energy were infectious. Did she really remember the codes seven decades later? Lew had spouted them so quickly during the conversation without any pause whatsoever that I felt certain that she was speaking extemporaneously. I dug back through my archival records to track down Kao’s original list of four-digit codes.

Looking up the three codes she had recited I could hardly believe my eyes.

This is part one of a two-part series on a brief history of 20th-century Chinese IT. Part two will appear next weekend.

Every semester I stump the Stanford students in my History of Information class with this query. The company in question is Sprint which stands for “Southern Pacific Railroad Internal Networking Telecommunications.”

What follows is a brisk lecture on the history of American communications infrastructure that always leaves a few minds blown.

Railroads I explain were in many ways the first layer in the history of modern American and global information architecture. With the rise of electric telegraphy engineers by and large chose to run their cables down the already cleared pathways of railroad lines like the Southern Pacific. Why fell more trees or traverse rivers anew when the work had already been done? Not long after came fiber optics which followed a similar pattern laying new infrastructure largely along the train routes that first connected the US more than 150 years ago.

“Who built the railroads?” I then ask. “Chinese immigrants” a student calls out.

“Exactly” I respond—not exclusively of course but Chinese immigrants to the United States contributed disproportionately to the country’s first transcontinental lines. They did so moreover while confronting a period of virulent and often violent anti-Chinese prejudice. “Now what about all those other infrastructures we just spoke of? The ones built on top of the railroad? Did the contribution of Asian immigrants and Asian Americans simply stop once the railroad was finished? What about telegraphy? Fiber optics? ARPANET? The internet? Science technology engineering and medicine more broadly?”

At this point the class begins in earnest. In particular students are primed and ready to examine the role of Asian immigrants and the broader AAPI community within the creation of our present-day sci-tech infrastructure.

Chung-chin Kao brings IBM to China

“Dear Mr. Watson: It is my great privilege to write you the first typewritten Chinese letter with the typewriter which was achieved only through your foresight and generous support.” ⁠

So began the first letter in history to be written on an electric Chinese typewriter—a machine invented in the late 1940s by Chinese American engineer Chung-chin Kao and built by IBM.

Kao (whose name also appears in the records as Kao Chung-Chin C.C. Kao and Gao Zhongqin) was born in China in 1906.⁠ In 1936 he went to the UK to study electrical engineering at Marconi College in Chelmsford. Two years later he traveled to Germany to continue his studies but his plans were cut short by the outbreak of World War II.⁠ In 1942 Kao traveled to the United States.⁠

By 1943 Kao had become chief of the radio department of the Central News Agency of China and research officer of radio communications for China’s Commission of Military Affairs. His main base of operations was in New York City at a workshop on East 37th Street.⁠ It was here that Kao began work on his big new project: to build the first electric typewriter for the Chinese language.

Like so many inventors and engineers of his day Kao’s first thoughts turned to IBM and to hopes of establishing a research and manufacturing partnership with the global juggernaut. In the early 1940s Kao presented initial sketches of his machine to company engineers and executives and a relationship grew from there. It reached fruition in 1947 with the debut of the machine.

To type a Chinese character one pressed a total of four numeric keys on the keyboard more or less simultaneously (compared by one observer at the time to playing a chord on the piano). These four-digit codes were used to locate the typist’s desired Chinese character providing the machine with that character’s “address” on a metal drum revolving inside the machine’s gun-metal gray chassis. Spinning continuously at a speed of 60 revolutions per minute the drum measured 7 inches in diameter and 11 inches in length. Its surface was etched with 5400 Chinese characters⁠ along with letters of the English alphabet punctuation marks numerals and other symbols—5400 characters and symbols in all each with its own unique four-digit code—a marvel of design and engineering for its day and age.

Knowing what we know today about IBM’s presence in Asia it might seem self-evident why IBM would have set about building an electric typewriter for the Chinese market. It was less obvious in the 1940s. Kao’s electric Chinese typewriter was one of IBM’s first major Chinese-specific products and at that point its largest. Although the machine itself was never brought to market—foiled by the civil war then raging in China which made investors understandably hesitant—nevertheless the project augured a future in which IBM would invest ever more heavily in east Asian markets.

Chan Yeh and the computerization of Chinese

In the second half of the 20th century IBM continued to attract many of the world’s most brilliant Asian and Asian American engineers. A prime example was Taiwanese American engineer inventor and entrepreneur Chan Yeh. Born in Taiwan Yeh served as an interpreter during the Korean War later migrating to the US and enrolling in the Northrop Aeronautical Institute (now Northrop University) in Inglewood California. He went on to work as a cargo aircraft mechanic at Slick Airways in Burbank before entering the Virginia Military Institute. His intention was to major in history. Due to his poor English language proficiency at the time however Yeh worried that he might fail out of the program. He decided to pursue electrical engineering instead.

But Yeh never lost his passion for history which he nourished by attending a lecture at VMI by Arnold Toynbee on the rise and fall of civilizations. Toynbee’s final lecture focused on China which as anyone familiar with Toynbee’s work would know constituted a major outlier in his study. Unlike the other civilizations examined in Toynbee’s classic—all of which rose and then fell—China had endured.

Toynbee credited the persistence of Chinese civilization to Chinese writing: a unifying medium that despite China’s immense size and diversity—notably the myriad dialects like Cantonese and Fujianese that formed mutually unintelligible languages unto themselves—served as a check on trends that had pulled apart so many other empires and civilization. Chinese script “holds people together even though they are ruled by other countries” Yeh once explained to me “so they always come back together.” He continued:

“So at that time I thought that with all the knowledge I had about technology—mechanical electrical electronic—and a Chinese person’s understanding of Chinese characters themselves I must do something to preserve this culture.”

Yeh graduated in 1960 with a BS in electrical engineering with a focus in military science. He went on to pursue graduate degrees at Cornell University receiving his MS in nuclear engineering in 1963 and then his PhD in Electrical Engineering in 1965. Upon graduating Yeh joined IBM. Specializing in automatic control he developed computational systems to manage industrial processes within paper mills petrochemical refineries steel mills sugar mills and the like. He was stationed in IBM’s still relatively new offices in San Jose California to work on developing simulations of large-scale manufacturing plants.

While working with IBM he dedicated his spare time to exploring an entirely different venture—the electronic processing of Chinese characters. He felt convinced it should be possible to digitize Chinese characters and thereby bring Chinese writing into the computer age. Yeh nicknamed his side-venture “Iron Eagle” on account of the Chinese characters that he first digitized: ying (eagle) and tie (iron).

“Iron Eagle” immediately caught the attention of Taiwanese brass. Taiwan’s Joint Chiefs of Staff suggested that Yeh quit IBM and focus on the project full-time. Yeh agreed and attempted to resign but was convinced by IBM to take a sabbatical year instead during which he could focus on his side project with greater concentration.

Yeh took a one-year leave of absence from IBM in 1971 serving as a visiting professor of applied mathematics and nuclear engineering at National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan. The following year he founded a company called Ideographix opening its doors in Sunnyvale California in one of the earliest buildings to be built in Silicon Valley. Yeh would serve as its president and chief engineer with his brother Chan Jong (“CJ”) as vice president.

The flagship product of Ideographix was the IPX a computerized phototypesetting system that would change Chinese printing forever.

For roughly the first seven years of its existence “Iron Eagle”—now renamed IPX—was limited to use by the Taiwanese and American militaries. Two of Yeh’s first major non-military clients were Taiwan’s Telecommunication Administration and the National Tax Administration of Taipei. For the former Ideographix helped process and transmit millions of phone bills and dramatically reduced the time needed to produce telephone directories. For the latter IPX enabled the production of tax return documents on an incomparable scale.

Yeh began to be approached by media outlets including one of Taiwan’s largest daily newspapers United Daily News (Lianhebao). At this newspaper an immense labor force of perhaps as many as 400 typesetters spent all evening setting type for the daily edition. With the introduction of the IPX system this labor force was reduced to a mere 50 who could suddenly do the job in far less time.

Exploiting this added speed United Daily News was able to wait longer until going to press closing the day’s news cycle at 2 am as compared to competitors who went to press in the late evening. This enabled the paper to scoop its rivals with a morning edition that included news that broke too late for other papers to cover.

The man who walked through walls: Leo Esaki and the secret life of electrons

Communication technologies were but one of the myriad fields pioneered by Asian immigrants and the Asian American Pacific Islander community. Contributions extended far and wide to the domains of medicine engineering chemistry and—in the case of Japanese American scientist Leo Esaki—physics.

Born in 1925 in Osaka Japan Esaki spent his teenage years surrounded by turmoil destruction and death. The experience implanted deep within him a desire to make sense of the world—to be able to peer through the chaotic surface of life to what he hoped might be a more stable underlying order. This search for meaning brought him to the study of physics. “In the natural sciences” Esaki commented in a 2004 interview “I think physics is certainly the most fundamental.”

Esaki’s early years at the University of Tokyo were punctuated by Allied bombings of the city. Some 12 years later he would earn his PhD and go on to join the Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation—the company we now know as Sony.

It was here that Esaki would make one of his most profound breakthroughs discovering a then-unknown type of “tunneling” within semiconductor materials. “One may have heard of the story of Dutilleul” Yale physicist Yu He explained to me in an interview referring to the protagonist of the science-fiction story The Man Who Walked through Walls. As Esaki discovered “walking through ‘atomic walls’ is actually a cakewalk in the secret life of the electrons on many modern-day electronic chips. Dr. Esaki was the one who brought this to light.”

In 1957 Esaki and colleagues made the first demonstration of solid tunneling effects in physics leading to a device that would come to bear his name: the Esaki tunnel diode the first quantum electronic device. Discovery of the tunnel diode not only laid a foundation for further exploration in the electronic transport of solids but it also inspired other advances in semiconductor science and electronics. “Esaki’s tunnel diode work ignited a real craze in the semiconductor industry for the device” Computer History Museum curator David Brock explains. Esaki himself went to pioneer many of these applications.

In 1960 Esaki joined IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights New York. While at IBM Esaki and his colleagues pioneered what are known as “designed semiconductor quantum structures’ such as artificially built superlattices. This concept of man-made superlattices would later influence a wide range of fields from semiconductors to metals and magnetic materials.

In 1973 Esaki shared the Nobel prize in physics in recognition of his discoveries going on to receive the IEEE Medal of Honor in 1991 and the Japan Prize in 1998 among other accolades. After moving back to Japan in 1992 Esaki served as president of the University of Tsukuba a leading Japanese research institution as well as the Shibaura Institute of Technology. His return to Japan made front-page news as he was the country’s only living Nobel Laureate in physics.

From the Transcontinental Railroad to Zoom

No single article could ever hope to chronicle the contributions of Asian immigrants and the AAPI community to the sci-tech infrastructure of the US and the world. For every story shared here there are thousands of others—like that of Korean American engineer Kie Y. Ahn and his research on magnetic films and memory devices (as well as the more than 500 patents that bear his name); or Ajay Bhatt the Indian American pioneer of the now-ubiquitous USB (Universal Serial Bus); or An Wang founder of Wang Laboratories; or Jenny Chuang the brilliant computer scientist who helped make many of Wang’s machines a reality.

Over the past year alone our digital worlds have been sustained by a host of companies founded by Asian Americans—including YouTube Airtable DoorDash and of course Zoom. Just as the first Asian immigrants to the US laid the groundwork for the country’s earliest large-scale physical infrastructure members of every subsequent generation of Asian immigrants in America and the AAPI community more broadly have continued to innovate and build an ever-more complex globally connected world.

The mines ministry is looking to address the ""issues and shortcomings"" that come in the way of fixation of average sale price (ASP) of minerals.The government has also sought suggestions from various stakeholders to overcome the issue till the National Mineral Index (NMI) is formulated for individual minerals.The development assumes significance in the wake of miners' body FIMI earlier urging the Centre to continue with the present system of average sale price published by Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) which it said is the most effective and transparent way to ensure price discovery and revenue to the exchequer.The mines ministry had in April constituted a committee for examining the double calculation of royalty due to its inclusion in calculation of ASP of minerals and developing an NMI for valuation of mineral resources as well as for determination of value for auction of mineral concessions and statutory payments for future auctions.The committee has decided to ""seek comments/suggestions from the governments of states and union territories mining industry stakeholders industry associations and other entities concerned on...the issues and shortcomings in fixation of ASP currently being done and suggest measures to overcome these till NMI is formulated for individual minerals"" the mines ministry said in a notice.The panel has also sought suggestions on the incidence of double calculation of royalty if any due to its inclusion in calculating ASP and has also asked for measures to address the same it said.The panel under the chairmanship of former coal secretary S K Srivastava has members from different organisations of the central government.FIMI had earlier said that the basic premise of NMI is that the present statutory payments including auction premium royalty District Mineral Foundation (DMF) and National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET) are based on ASP published by IBM.""We submit that the present system of ASP is a realistic price discovery mechanism wherein the actual transaction price of top 10 non-captive mines in a state sold at an arm's length basis is captured. In short ASP is the weighted average of the ex-mine prices of non-captive mines"" it had said.National Mineral Index is being developed on the lines of the National Coal Index (NCI) which is based on Coal India (CIL) notified prices and auction prices and import prices FIMI said.While majority of the coal consumed in the country is for power which is a regulated sector all non-coal minerals are consumed for non-regulated sectors such as steel aluminium cement etc.Considering this fundamental difference of regulated and non-regulated consuming sectors the methodology of calculation of NMI should fundamentally differ from that of NCI FIMI had stated.""We also understand that there is a strong attempt by players who have bid unsustainably high auction premiums to include captive sales transactions in NMI....This will help such captive players to report lower than market transactions which will be captured in NMI eventually bringing it down and associated statutory payments to the exchequer"" the miners' body had said.The CII had said that the development of the proposed uniform National Mineral Index for all minerals in line with National Coal Index will tackle the ambiguities in the current average sale price regime resolve irregularities of high ASP of limestone and bauxite (metal)."

Made for ultra-portable laptops these latest additions slot in at the top of their respective classes with the Core i7 acting as the new flagship Intel CPU for thin and lightweight laptops. Instead of waiting to introduce a new generation of processors Intel is eking out as much performance as it can with these somewhat unusual mid-cycle releases which bring slightly boosted speeds to the current crop of chips.

This duo of U-series processors arrives as Intel tries to fend off competition from AMD and Apple two rivals that have both released chips capable of going blow-for-blow and in some cases outperforming those from Intel. The chipmaker now faces some of the stiffest competition in years and could see its hold on the industry shrink as a result. If these new U-series Core i5 and Core i7 chips perform as well as Intel claims it might convince vendors to stick with Team Blue when they release the newest versions of their laptops.

Intel Core i7-1195G7 specs and performance

The Core i7-1195G7 is identical to the previous top-of-the-stack chip the Core i7-1185G7 in many ways. It has a 4 core/8 thread configuration uses DDR4-3200 RAM and has an operating range of 12-28W.

What puts the Core i7-1195G7 ahead is Intel's ability to squeeze a bit more performance out of the same platform. The newest chip now hits a max single-core turbo of 5.0GHz (up from 4.8GHz) and an all-core turbo of 4.6GHz (up from 4.3GHz). The base frequency drops from 3.0GHz to 2.9GHz on the new model. Wi-Fi 6/6e is supported for data speeds at up to 6GHz.

Intel makes some bold claims about how the Core i7-1195G7 fares against the best from AMD in the Ryzen 7 5800U. Before I get into the numbers keep in mind that these were published by Intel which has the luxury of picking and choosing benchmarks that make its processors look best. We will run these same tests once we get in laptops powered by the latest Intel chips. Until then don't take these benchmarks as gospel.

With that said Intel claims the Core i7-1195G7 can outperform the AMD Ryzen 7 5800U in various gaming benchmarks. The company didn't provide actual frame rates but said the Core i7-1195G7 delivered roughly 2x performance over the Ryzen 7 in Rust GRID Genshin Impact and Amnesia Rebirth. Fortnite supposedly played 1.46x better on the Intel while the performance of Valheim was a whopping 2.78x faster.

Shifting to content creation the Core i7-1195G7 is said to bring 2x faster video editing workflow performance than the Ryzen 7 and 2.36x faster speeds when using Adobe Lightroom Photo Merge. It is 1.82x quicker with DaVinci Resolve and more than 8x faster when transcoding a 4K HEVC 10-bit video to 1080p using the HandBrake Nightly app.

Intel Core i5-1155G7 specs and performance

Now the fastest Core i5 processor in Intel's stack the Core i5-1155G7 has 4 cores and 8 threads and uses DDR4-3200 RAM. It differs from the Core i7 in that it uses 80 graphics units instead of 96 and has 8GB of cache versus 12GB.

Of course the clock speeds are below those of the Core i7 but push beyond the Core i5-1145G7 announced last year. The new chip has a base 2.5Ghz frequency (down from 2.6GHz) and reaches a single-core turbo of up to 4.5Ghz up from 4.4Ghz. The max all-core turbo is 4.3GHz up from 4.0Ghz. Like the Core i7 chip the Core i5-1155G7 supports Wi-Fi 6 and 6e.

Intel did not provide any benchmark comparisons involving the Core i5-1155G7; we should get a better idea of how it performs in the coming weeks when we're able to do our own benchmark tests.

Intel 5G Solution 5000

As part of its chip release Intel is also introducing a 5G M.2 solution to give laptops support for the latest wireless mobile speeds. In partnership with MediaTek and Fibocom the 5G Solution 5000 will pair with 11th Gen Intel Core U- and H-series chips. Acer Asus and HP will be among the first to offer laptops with this 5G platform and Intel claims more than 30 models will arrive in 2022.

Outlook

It is one thing to release new processors it's an entirely different challenge to get laptop makers to use them. Fortunately for Intel the Core i7-1195G7 and Core i5-1155G7 will be found in 60 ""designs"" or models by this holiday season. Acer Asus Lenovo and MSI are said to be investing in the new chips with laptops arriving this summer.

From our perspective these new processors are minor iterations on the 11th Gen chips Intel released last year. They use the same Willow Cove architecture made with a 10-nanometer node and boast similar specs. What you get with the latest trio of Intel chips is better optimization for slightly faster clock speeds. We'll soon find out how much extra oomph they bring to portable laptops when the first batch arrives in the coming months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXIuY29tL2ludGVsLWlzLWhhcHB5LXRvLWJ1cm4tYnJpZGdlcy13aXRoLWV4LW1hYy1tYXRlLWFwcGxlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel is happy to burn bridges with ex-Mac mate Apple,"In a recent call with Intel's Ryan Shrout about the performance of its 11th Generation H-series laptop processors he took some time out to throw some serious shade Apple's way. Actually Ryan was throwing shade around as if it was going out of fashion with AMD ARM and Apple all getting some. Maybe Intel simply doesn't like the start of the alphabet? Anyway most of the exasperation was reserved for its old bestie Apple.

According to Intel it's the poor gaming experience of a Mac that makes its own devices superior. A sentiment I can definitely get behind but it's still surprising to hear that coming from Intel.

This wasn't an idle boast either Intel has thrown some research behind its feeling. Not only are Apple Macs rubbish because they run Apple's own M1 silicon which is obviously inferior to what Intel used to make but over half of the most popular games don't even run on the platform.

What of emulators I hear you ask? Yeah they had that covered too. By showing off Valheim running appallingly through Parallels: trees popping in out of existence textures appearing and disappearing. It was not pretty.

Not content with that it then produced this slide:

(Image credit: Intel)

The red in this graph is actually an Intel-powered MacBook Pro using a Core i9 9980HK alongside an AMD Radeon Pro 5600M to be exact compared to the Core i5 11400H alongside a GeForce RTX 3060. Proof if it were needed that PCs are just better. Leading to Intel dropping the slide about PCs offering better gaming experiences than 100% of Mac laptops.

There's an underlying theme here that gaming is not a niche anymore. That even among creators that have bought a laptop for work they still game. And so the fact that you can't game properly on a Mac means that Apple should probably give up and go home.

To be fair gaming on a Mac absolutely is rubbish and it's not something I'd want to do. But I'm still surprised that Intel is so angry about it all. I even asked if Intel was burning its bridges with Apple? The answer was that Apple has been very public about moving to its own silicon and that it is now a competitor. All's fair in love and war I guess.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8zMC9pbnRlbC1hbm5vdW5jZXMtdHdvLW5ldy0xMXRoLWdlbi1jaGlwcy1hbmQtYS01Zy1tLTItbGFwdG9wLW1vZHVsZS1hdC1jb21wdXRleC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel announces two new 11th-gen chips and a 5G M.2 laptop module at Computex,"Intel kicked off this year’s virtual Computex by announcing two new 11th-gen U-Series chips for use in thin lightweight laptops. It also unveiled its first 5G M.2 module for laptops designed in a partnership with MediaTek (Intel sold its smartphone modem business to Apple in 2019).

Both of Intel’s new chips have Intel Irix Xe graphics. The flagship model is the Core i7-1195G7 which has a base clock speed of 2.9 GHz but can reach up to 5.0 GHz on a single core using Intel’s Turbo Boost Max 3.0 tech. The other chip called the Core i5-1155G7 has a base clock speed of 2.5 GHz and a maximum of 4.5 GHz. Both chips have four cores and eight threads.

The 5G M.2 module called the “5G Solution 5000” supports 5G NR midband sub-6 GHz frequencies and eSIM tech. Intel has partnerships with telecoms in North America EMEA APAC Japan and Australia. The module is expected to be in laptops produced by Acer ASUS HP and other manufacturers by the end of this year and OEMs are also working on 250 designs based on 11th-gen U-Series chips expected to hit the market by the holidays.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vaG90aGFyZHdhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaW50ZWwtdGlnZXItbGFrZS1iLTEwbm0tZGVza3RvcC1wcm9jZXNzb3Jz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Quietly Launches Tiger Lake-B 10nm Desktop Processors With Blistering Boost Clocks,"



If you thought Alder Lake-S would be Intel's next desktop processor launch think again. There's a new CPU line that was launched without any boisterous announcement or fanfare that being Tiger Lake. Yes Tiger Lake already exists but not just in mobile form anymore—Intel ported its Tiger Lake architecture over to the desktop.





There are four new SKUs each with a new ""B"" suffix. Well the top model carries the ""KB"" suffix because it is also an unlocked processor. So what does the B designation mean? In a statement Intel essentially confirmed speculation that the B means BGA as these new chips are ball grid array parts that are soldered directly to the motherboard rather than LGA (land grid array) like most of its modern desktop processors.





These are the SKUs...

11th Gen Intel Core i9-11900KB

11th Gen Intel Core i7-11700KB

11th Gen Intel Core i5-11500B

11th Gen Intel Core i3-11100B For the casual consumer wading through Intel's model names architecture codenames and generational labeling can be confusing. In this instance Intel is essentially reusing its 12th Gen Core ""Rocket Lake"" model numbers at least for the Core i5 SKUs and up. However chips like the 11th Gen Core i9-11900KB should not be confused with the 12th Gen Core i9-11900K because they are two entirely separate architectures.



Click to Enlarge



Core i9-11900KB is an 8-core/16-thread desktop Potential confusion aside these are interesting additions as found in Intel's ARK database. They are manufactured on a 10-nanometer node and feature some impressive boost clocks as well as onboard graphics. As shown above Intel's top model the is an 8-core/16-thread desktop Tiger Lake processor with a 3.3GHz base clock and 4.9GHz max turbo frequency and can hit 5.3GHz via Thermal Velocity Boost. It also sports 24MB of L3 cache and has a 65W TDP. Intel lists the recommended customer pricing at $417.

The Core i7-11700B meanwhile is also an 8-core/16-thread CPU but with a 3.2GHz base clock 4.8GHz max turbo clock 5.3GHz Thermal Velocity Boost frequency 24MB of L3 cache and a 65W TDP. There is no mention of the recommended customer pricing.

Moving down the list the Core i5-11500B is a 6-core/12-thread chip with a 3.3GHz base clock 4.6GHz max turbo clock 5.3GHz Turbo Velocity Boost frequency 12MB of L3 cache and a 65W TDP. Like the Core i7 part Intel has not listed a price point.

Finally the Core i3-11100B is a 4-core/8-thread CPU with a 3.6GHz base block 4.4GHz max turbo clock 5.3GHz Turbo Velocity Boost frequency 12MB L3 cache and a 65W TDP. And once again there is no reference to pricing.

Those are some relatively fast clock speeds across the board especially the 5.3GHz Turbo Velocity Boost rating for all four chips. And on the graphics side the Core i9 i7 and i5 models each sport onboard Xe graphics with 32 execution units clocked at 350MHz to 1.45GHz. The Core i3 part meanwhile features Xe graphics with 16 execution units and is clocked at 350MHz to 1.4GHz.



Where will these show up?



""Intel has partnered with customers interested in expanding their product portfolio with enthusiast small form-factor desktop designs. The Intel Core i9-11900KB processor is a BGA solution built with unique specifications and performance specifically for these designs"" Intel said in a statement.





We can safely assume the same explanation applies to the other three Tiger Lake-B SKUs and not just the Core i9-11900KB. It will be interesting to see what kinds of designs Intel's hardware partners concoct with access to these new desktop parts. These could power some relatively stout mini PCs and compact SFF systems that could prove intriguing if priced right.

Revealed at Computex 2021 the chipmaker says the new Intel 5G Solution 5000 modem will be available in laptops from Acer ASUS and HP later this year and in more than 30 laptop designs by 2022. Intel is also expanding its Tiger Lake lineup for ultra-thin laptops with a CPU that goes up to 5GHz.

Intel is bringing 5G connectivity to laptops and a new Tiger Lake CPU capable of delivering speeds of up to 5GHz to ultra-thin notebooks later this year which it called an industry-first.

The Santa Clara Calif.-based company made the announcements at Computex 2021 on Sunday saying that its new 5G modem called Intel 5G Solution 5000 will be available in laptops from Acer ASUS and HP later this year and in more than 30 laptop designs by 2022. It was developed with MediaTek and Fibocom as part of a previously announced collaboration.

The Intel 5G Solution 5000 is an M.2 module that has been certified for coverage across the world including from carriers AT&T and Spring. Intel said it can deliver download speeds of up to 4.7 Gbps and upload speeds of up to 1.25 Gbps. This translates into a nearly five-fold increase in speed over Intel’s Gigabit LTE technology the company added.

The chipmaker also revealed two additions to the company’s 11th-generation Core U-Series mobile processors which are collectively known under the code name Tiger Lake. The first is a new flagship CPU the Intel Core i7-1195G7 which the company said can deliver up to 5GHz on a single core in turbo mode and outpaces AMD’s top Ryzen 7 5800U across multiple games and content creation applications.

For instance Intel said the new Core i7-1195G7 can provide 46-178 percent faster performance across games ranging from Fortnite to Valheim compared to AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800U. In addition the company said the new Core i7 is 93 percent faster for video editing 82 percent faster for DaVinci Resolve 156 percent faster for Cyberlink Power Director 136 percent faster for Adobe Lightroom Photo Merge and 98 percent faster for Adobe Premiere Pro Scene Detect. For the HandBrake open-source video transcoder Intel said the Core i8 can deliver as much as eight times faster performance.

The new processors which also includes the new mid-range Intel Core i5-1155G7 will be available in laptops from Acer ASUS Lenovo and MSI this summer and will go in more than 60 laptop designs by the holiday season.

Totally false,"The Associated Press checks out some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week. This one is bogus even though it was shared widely on social media. Here are the facts:

CLAIM: Video shows parents in Toronto being blocked by police as children were given the COVID-19 vaccine in exchange for ice cream without parental permission.

THE FACTS: Posts online are falsely claiming that a video showing protesters outside a vaccine pop-up clinic at Toronto City Hall were in fact parents trying to stop health professionals and police from vaccinating their children.

The city of Toronto and the University Health Network held a pop-up vaccination event on May 23 at City Hall where 2500 doses of vaccine were administered along with free ice cream to those 12 years of age and older according to the University Health Network.

Canada became the first country to approve the Pfizer vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds on May 5 a decision that was criticized by anti-vaccine advocates.

In videos online protesters can be seen at Nathan Phillips Square outside City Hall speaking out against vaccinating children at the clinic.

“This is our children and we will not back down” one woman could be heard yelling in the video at police.

Posts online shared the video to falsely claim it showed children being vaccinated against their parents’ wishes. “A pop up vaccine clinic in Canada that is offering kids free ice cream in exchange for a vaccine no parental permission required. Police are guarding the front to stop parents from intervening” one tweet said.

Another post claimed that the video showed parents being barred from a school campus where children were being vaccinated without parental consent.

Gillian Howard a spokesperson for the University Health Network said clinic staff did not see children being vaccinated without a family member present. “Anyone receiving vaccination would have been taken through the consent process by clinical staff and if there was any indication that someone – whatever their age – didn’t understand the consent process they would not be vaccinated” she wrote in an email.

Only a handful of demonstrators took part in the protest. Howard said that police were present due to threats to the clinic.

Under Ontario’s Health Care Consent Act there is no minimum age to provide consent for vaccination according to Toronto Public Health spokesperson Dr. Vinita Dubey. Rather it is up to the healthcare providers to ensure that they obtain informed consent prior to immunization.

“This means the healthcare provider administering the vaccine has to deem the youth capable of understanding their decision” Dubey said. “If the individual is incapable of consenting to receiving the vaccine they would need consent from their substitute decision-maker such as their parent or legal guardian.”

Francisco “Paco” Magsaysay owner of Carmen’s Best told BusinessMirror in an e-mail interview that using the tools of social media has boosted growth of the brand. Inspired by its initial success Magsaysay said he is now using it in promoting Arctic Ice Cream a “value” brand that is their latest product.

“We grew Carmen’s Best ice cream using social media. We can do the same with Arctic. In fact it will be easier for us as our company is known to make excellent ice cream. We feel that we have created an excellent ice cream in the category of Arctic Ice Cream” Magsaysay said.

With Arctic Magsaysay said there was no way they could compete with the big ice cream manufacturers. “This is why we decided to offer our ice cream to the public through the e-commerce site of Carmen’s Best.”

Despite the drastic shift on buying patterns of consumers Magsaysay is confident that Carmen’s Best will flourish in the new normal as it fits quite well with their plan to sell more using its e-commerce platform.

Magsaysay said there are definitely opportunities for a handful of industries to succeed in the current environment. “The question is: If you build your business to cater within the existing situation what will happen when things return to normal?” Magsaysay pointed out.

Since Carmen’s Best started its ice cream business as a business-to-business (B2B) food manufacturer Magsaysay said their clients were travel and hospitality players such as restaurants coffee shops hotels resorts and airlines. When the pandemic hit demand for Carmen’s Best declined as the business of their customers also experienced a slowdown.

“Fortunately at the end of 2019 we had started to develop a ‘value’ line ice cream that could be sold to our B2B accounts that were buying mass-market ice cream brands for their a la mode desserts milk shakes and that ‘free’ scoop of ice cream packaged with their set lunch promotions. This was a business I had always been keen to enter” he said.

“Call it serendipity but this business decision coincided with the rough times we were entering due to the unprecedented effects of the Covid-19 virus. Artic fit perfectly a market that was reeling from the slowdown in the economy” he added.

In closing Magsaysay said the current environment is a humbling experience for Filipinos: “Now is not the time to brag about thriving and shining or getting ahead of others. The important thing is to help out and pull together to survive.”",,,,,,,,,

In a paper published recently in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health UCI researchers show that elderly and low-income residents have suffered a disproportionate share of the fires’ impacts. “For this study we analyzed the fire frequency and area burned by wildfires across all Census tracts in California over the last 20 years” said lead author Shahir Masri assistant specialist in air pollution exposure assessment and epidemiology in UCI’s Program in Public Health. “Intuitively rural areas sustain more wildfire damage than other parts of the state. Importantly however these areas also happen to be characterized by higher poverty rates unemployment and a greater proportion of low-income residents without college degrees. We also found that whether rural or not communities hit hardest by wildfires had much higher proportions of elderly residents.” While lower proportions of minority residents tended to reside in high-impact Census tracts an exception was for Native Americans who were over three-times more concentrated in such areas.

Between 1980 and 1999 catastrophic wildfires happened an average of 1.5 times per decade. From 2000 to 2019 incidents increased to seven per 10-year period. Cumulative costs jumped from $10 billion to $75 billion over the two time spans as noted in the study. Co-author Jun Wu UCI professor of public health said that a large portion of these expenses have fallen on people who can least afford them and victims have often suffered from smoke-related health problems psychological stress and direct physical injury. “Our study shines a spotlight on an emerging problem in our state in which the effects of climate change are coming into direct contact with environmental injustice that touches socioeconomically vulnerable communities” she said. “The work underscores the need for enhanced aid and recovery efforts in these regions as well as the importance of forest management and other fire-prevention strategies. It should also signal to policymakers and officials in state agencies that they must consider elderly and low-income individuals when allocating funds for wildfire prevention resources.”

Early broken chain slows but doesn’t stop Boulder woman

As racers sprinted out of the start line looking for a holeshot Erin Huck suddenly looked down noticing a loss of power. Her chain was broken.

The 39-year-old Olympic hopeful from Boulder pulled to the side and watched the professional women’s mountain bike field race out of Durango Mesa Park on Sunday during the 49th Iron Horse Bicycle Classic. The favorite to win the race and the Queen of the Mountain title for the IHBC didn’t know what to do next.

With chain in hand Huck asked if it was OK to try to replace it. Granted permission she ran over to a friendly team van from Boulder Junior Cycling where she got a new chain. After falling six minutes behind she loaded back onto her bike and set out on a 27-mile assault of the course that made three laps between the Durango Mesa Park and Horse Gulch trail system.

“I didn’t have tools or anything to fix it so that would have been race over for me. I was just glad to have the opportunity to race” Huck said. “I didn’t do my due diligence with bike maintenance before this. I’m just glad it happened right at the start so I was able to get help instead of being out there by myself.”

Making time on the rest of the women’s field every second Huck found herself in third place at the end of two laps. Unable to catch Utah’s Evelyn Dong or Boulder’s Madigan Munro that is where Huck would finish one day after she claimed the IHBC pro women’s road race victory on the 47-mile ride from Durango to Silverton.

Dong who was third in the road race would win Sunday’s grueling mountain bike race in 2 hours 35 minutes 50 seconds. Riders who compete in both the road and mountain bike races earn points toward the Queen of the Mountain standings. Dong was third in the women’s road race giving her and Huck both 48 points. But the tiebreaker went to Huck for winning the road race and Dong thought that’s exactly the way it should have gone.

“The road race should be weighted a little more. That’s the premier event and the mountain bike is the hair of the dog event” Dong said.

For Huck who is likely to be picked by USA Cycling as the third women’s rider for the team at the Tokyo Olympics later this summer the win in the women’s road race backed and a memorable ride on the mountain bike was the perfect way to return to Colorado from early-season World Cup mountain bike racing in Europe.

“This was just what the doctor ordered. It was super fun to race with such great people and to be at a race with people cheering for us” Huck said. “I don’t know how long it’s been since we had people cheering at a Colorado race so that was pretty special.”

Munro finished second Sunday 3:46 behind Dong’s dominant performance. Huck was third 4:14 back after nearly catching back up to the younger Boulder rider.

To even get back to the women’s pro field and pass 15 of those riders Huck also had to get around 23 riders in the men’s ages 19-34 race who had started shortly after the pro women.

“That was really hard. There weren’t that many passing opportunities. When it was open it was full gas sprint as hard as I could over and over again” Huck said. “But it was also kind of nice because I was always with people except the last lap when I was pretty much by myself.

Dong had a crash on the first lap on the first descent and again in the final berm turn before riding into the finish line. But nothing could keep her from victory though she knew younger riders such as Munro and Durango’s Ruth Holcomb were mighty challengers.

“The kids go out really hard. I’m too old for that” the 36-year-old Dong said. “I stayed behind the kids for a bit and they were going fast. If it was a two-lap race one of the kids would have won. On the second lap I decided to open it up a bit on that second climb and slowly got a gap.”

Holcomb 18 was third after one lap not far behind Dong and Munro. But a flat tire late in the second lap would end her day and she did not finish on a hot and windy afternoon.

“It is so hot and all the climbs are so brutal” Holcomb said. “I knew Erin was not with us at the start so I knew I had to really hang it out there on the downhills to keep her off me because I can’t quite hang at her pace on the ups. Second lap coming down the last downhill I smacked a rock and flatted my tire.”

Holcomb who still races at the junior level in UCI events was excited to race alongside established pros such as Dong and Huck in her hometown race.

“Erin is incredible but Evelyn was flying out there so it was going to be tough. But seeing Erin come back from down six minutes is out of this world” she said. “Seeing the level they race at is insane and inspiring. It’s so fun to learn from them and see where they are.”

Durango’s own Ellen Campbell would place fourth 18:59 behind the winning time of Dong. Behind her was a long list of Durango talent with Bailey Cioppa Lauren Aggeler Madelyn Roberson and Michaela Thompson finishing fifth through eighth respectively.

Only nine pro women finished the race of the 18 who started. While the course was a strong challenge Holcomb said she hopes the traditional IHBC mountain bike course in downtown Durango involving Steamworks Brewing Co. returns next year once the COVID-19 pandemic is under control.

“I would have been good with two laps of this course” Holcomb said. “This is the longest race aside from the road race (Saturday) that I’ve done all year. Nothing wrong with that but I was tired and ready to be done early.

“It was fun on these trails but there’s something so special about racing in downtown Durango with the whole town around you and there were a lot of lonely spots out there on the course today.’

“We did take first” Esky coach Tom Penegor said. “We were in six of the eight finals and won four of them.”

In the final tally the Eskymos (34) finished three points ahead of West Iron County (31). Marquette took third with 24 and Menominee (16) Gladstone (8) and Kingsford (7) followed.

“Even with these results to only win by three it just shows you need every point” Penegor said. “We won the U.P. Finals in 2007 which will be going on after next week. The only difference in that is that Negaunee is in that and WIC is not.”

The six finals the Eskymos participated in were at No. 1 singles No. 4 singles No. 1 doubles No. 2 doubles No. 3 doubles and No. 4 doubles and they earned the victory at No. 4 singles No. 1 doubles No. 2 doubles and No. 3 doubles.

“We played well” Penegor said. “I was really proud of the guys. They really did a good job. We’ve been stressing all year to have fun and get better and we did today. We had some outstanding performances under pressure today.

“Today we were in six and won four. We went out there and got it which is what we had to do. If we didn’t WIC would have beaten us. Our guys performed today. We got points to form everybody that played — truly team effort.”

At No. 1 singles Esky’s Connor Smale drew a bye in the first round to face Menominee’s Danny Birch in the semifinal but Smale made quick work of the match finishing it in two sets 6-2 6-1. He then finished Marquette’s Jason Andery in two sets as well 6-4 6-1.

“Number one performance was at No. 4 singles Connor Smale” Penegor said. “He won the No. 4 singles championship. He played the best tennis I’ve ever seen him play. A few weeks ago I was down on him and over the last ten days he’s really turned it around and put in a real gutsy performance today. (He also) beat number one seeded Marquette … Really dug deep. Can’t say enough about how he played in the conditions against two tough players. I was really proud of him.”

At No. 1 doubles the Esky duo of Viktor Pospisil and Ryan Moreau also drew a first-round bye to face Menominee in the semifinal. Against the Maroons duo of Aidan Bellisile and Brady Schultz the Eskymos lost a close first set 6-7 but recovered to win it in the final two 6-2 6-2. Pospisil and Moreau were then challenged by Kingsford’s Caleb Boone and Isaac Nash in the finals but the Eskymos obtained the title in two sets 6-2 6-1.

“Those guys (doubles players) have been steady all year” Penegor said. “Today the kids really performed.”

For No. 2 doubles Isaac Maki and Dawson Williams enjoyed another first-round bye for the Eskymos and continued on to battle Menominee. Maki and Williams finished the Maroons’ Aden Laurin and Trevor Theuerkauk in two 6-2 6-2.

It was a three-set affair in the finals however. The Eskymos dropped the first set 3-6 but recovered to win two in a row 6-1 6-2 against WIC’s Lucas Isaacson and Cole Alexa.

“No. 2 doubles was the last match in the finals” Penegor said. “Isaac Maki and Dawson Williams played against two outstanding seniors. Gracious good kids. They were just outstanding people. It was just a great match. Everyone was cheering on every point. Both teams were just so close.”

Tanner McDonald and Jordan Nance picked up the Eskymos’ final win at No. 3 doubles. After a first-round bye McDonald and Nance faced off against Gladstone’s Isaac Berthaume and Zach Brazeau emerging victorious 6-1 6-1.

The Esky duo then finished the finals against Marquette in two 6-2 7-5.

For the Braves Rane Castor at No. 1 singles and Peter Noblet at No. 2 singles were the others that managed to push through the opening round.

Castor defeated Menominee’s Felope Zamora in three 6-0 6-7(7) 6-4 but fell to Marquette’s Nick Olivier just after 6-1 6-0.

At No. 2 Noblet overcame Menominee’s Jason Bowers in three 3-6 6-4 7-6 but fell against WIC’s Mitch Ballinger 6-0 6-0.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR1cmFuZ29oZXJhbGQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2lyb24taG9yc2UtYmljeWNsZS1jbGFzc2ljLWVhZ2VyLWZvci01MHRoLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LWluLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Iron Horse Bicycle Classic eager for 50th anniversary in 2022,"A year delayed but years in the making

×

As soon as the 45th Iron Horse Bicycle Classic finished in 2016 organizers started to think about the 50th.

While that golden anniversary should have come this weekend 50 years after bicyclist Tom Mayer first challenged his brother Jim in a race between bike and train from Durango to Silverton it instead will come in 2022 – 50 years after co-founder Ed Zink first helped Tom Mayer put together a 36-rider event as a kick-start to tourism season.

The COVID-19 pandemic canceled the 2020 edition of the Memorial Day weekend spectacle that is the second-longest continuing cycling event in the United States. A toned down 49th edition of the IHBC will now ride on Saturday and Sunday.

“We held off opening registration and planning this year as long as possible because the COVID needle kept moving. It’s good to know now that from a COVID standpoint we are in good shape and it won’t stop us from having this 49th event” said IHBC director Gaige Sippy. “To have the ability to get the 49th off the ground is fantastic so that we can really get ready for that 50th next year.”

Zink had long looked forward to the 50th anniversary before he died of a heart attack in October 2019. Sippy has doubled down on his commitment to the IHBC since the death of his mentor and will aim to bring his vision to life in 2022.

The IHBC asked for public comment in 2019 on what participants would like to see at a 50th anniversary. Always changing through the years to stay on top of the latest trends in the cycling world many events have come and gone and some long lost are likely to return for the 50th even if for only one year.

That includes the famous “Roostmaster” on Chapman Hill which was televised in 1993 by Prime Sports Network and by ESPN in 1994. That event lined up mountain bikers to complete laps on a course that started with a hill climb followed by a downhill slalom a water jump and then a sprint to the line each lap. At the end of each circuit the last three riders across the finish line were eliminated. After two heats and a final a champion was crowned.

“That was a crazy event being televised and with a big crowd” said Ned Overend a former mountain bike world champion and five-time Iron Horse road race winner. “It suited some of us better than others like John Tomac and people who had BMX backgrounds. It showed in the races. Bringing that and the downhill stuff at Chapman Hill back for the 50th it’s going to be a great way to help launch the Iron Horse into its next 50 years and I hope everyone comes back for that big celebration.”

Along with the Roostmaster at Chapman Hill Sippy also aims to bring back dual slalom racing under the lights at the in-town venue.

BMX had its big show in downtown Durango during the 2017 and 2018 events drawing spectators to the high-flying sport. It also could make a return in 2022.

The IHBC will aim to bring back downtown road circuit racing to give true road cyclists another event besides the road race. In past years the IHBC would crown omnium road champions who competed in the road race criterium and time trial. But as participation in the Memorial Day time trial dwindled and fewer cyclists looked to participate in the Sunday circuit race a longer gravel ride was born to add to Sunday’s mountain bike event that famously rips through the bar at Steamworks Brewing Co.

Perhaps the biggest addition to the 50th could involve the town of Ouray Silverton’s northern neighbor across Red Mountain Pass. While a longer pro race from Durango to Ouray isn’t in the cards the IHBC had been working with Ouray in 2019 to consider an additional IHBC road ride that started in Ouray and finished in Silverton.

“I would like to do the Ouray-to-Silverton on the same day we do Durango to Silverton” Sippy said. “We already have the passes closed going from Durango to Ouray and most people don’t get on Red Mountain Pass from Ouray to Silverton during those hours because they know they are going to get stopped in Silverton. U.S. Highway 550 is so quiet at that point I think we can do it.”

Sippy said preliminary talks have been held with Colorado State Patrol and Colorado Department of Transportation about a Ouray-to-Silverton ride.

“What has changed is the town manager in Ouray since we last had conversations” Sippy said. “Looking at the 50th coming up for us we’d like to see if the new town manager is interested in being involved with us and having that weekend tourism bump for them as well.”

The 2020 edition was slated to have a fat-tire criterium race in downtown Durango for mountain bikers similar to what is seen at Epic Rides mountain bike races across the country in an event that fills downtown sidewalks with spectators. That would have been on Friday night after registration during the downtown party at Buckley Park.

That event did not carry over to the condensed 49th edition though Sippy hopes to make it work in 2022. This year the IHBC also scrapped the Cruzer Crit ride for costumed cyclists parading around downtown as well as family-friendly events such as the kids race. The goal is to bring all those traditional events back including the mountain bike race’s ride through Steamworks for the 50th anniversary after taking a hiatus this year.

“The 50th is going to be incredible” said Durango’s Todd Wells a three-time mountain bike Olympian who spent time on the IHBC committee from 2019-20 during the planning phases for the 50th. “An event like the Iron Horse that incorporates road mountain BMX and gravel everything Durango does in the cycling world they do a great job with. By this time next year hopefully COVID is under control and is an ancient memory for us and we can have this giant celebration of cycling and Durango that Ed Zink would have wanted.”

Zink’s surviving wife Patti said she hasn’t been involved with IHBC planning since his death. But she has been thrilled to see the passion of Sippy and the rest of the organizers going into an event that meant so much to her husband through 48 years of his life. And she is eager to see all of Zink’s friends and many of those he inspired return when the IHBC plans to honor her late husband next year.

“Ed would have been ecstatic” Patti Zink said. “He started thinking about the 50th after 45. He finished that milestone and started dreaming of what it could look like and what it would do for the town from a publicity standpoint. He wanted to get Durango more on the map again in cycling because we have fallen off a bit. He saw the 50th and what is going on with the bike park and county fairgrounds plan at Durango Mesa Park as a boost and a way to remind the world what Durango is as a cycling community.”

As for Tom Mayer he said he wouldn’t miss the 50th anniversary of the event he inspired when he first raced brother Jim a brakeman on the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad line from Durango to Silverton.

“I definitely want to come up for the 50th” said Mayer who resides in Albuquerque. “I can do 40 miles on the mountain bike right now but not the road bike. I gotta get back to training for the 50th. I am 72 now but I know I can still do it and won’t use age for an excuse.

“It’s such an awesome event and I want to do it. I want to beat the train again at the 50th.”

I'm buying for the long term after all. – F.H. Ardmore Indiana

A: Ideally we should buy stocks that seem undervalued as they offer a margin of safety. Buying overvalued stocks can be risky as they might drop closer to their intrinsic value at any time especially over the short term. Yes over the long term the intrinsic value of healthy and growing companies will grow. But it's still possible to simply pay too much for a stock.

Consider for example networking titan Cisco Systems which was a market darling before the internet bubble burst. Cisco's stock was trading between $55 and $59 per share (on a split-adjusted basis) back in 2000 – but recently it was trading at around $52 per share. Those who bought the stock near its peak back then are still underwater – 21 years later!

Companies and their stocks don't always perform as you hope or expect so it's best to reduce your risk by focusing on healthy and growing companies ideally with little to no debt that are trading for much less than they're likely to be worth in the future.

Q: How can I access the earnings reports that companies file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)? – J.N. Strasburg Va.

ADVERTISEMENT

A: Try starting at a company's own website where it's likely to have an ""Investors"" area with links to earnings reports and other resources. Or call the company's Investor Relations department and ask if they can mail you the latest filings. You can also look up companies' quarterly 10-Q and annual 10-K reports at SEC.gov/edgar.shtml.

Fool's School

How to pick a brokerage: If you're thinking of investing in the stock market you're probably going to need a brokerage account. There are lots of good brokerages to choose from but doing a little research first can help you zero in on the ones that will serve you best. Here are some considerations:

Minimum initial deposit: With some brokerages you might need $2500 to open an account while other brokerages require $500 or even $0. (Some have no minimum for IRA accounts.)

Costs: Check out what your candidate brokerages charge to trade stocks mutual funds ETFs and more and for any other services you might use such as money transfers. Many brokerages these days charge nothing for most trades.

Research: Many good brokerages offer free in-depth research reports on a wide variety of investments from sources such as Argus Credit Suisse Morningstar Ned Davis S&P The Street Thomson Reuters Zacks and more.

Mutual funds: If you plan to invest in mutual funds you can usually do so via the website of each fund but it can be much more convenient to do so through your brokerage. So consider how many funds and which families of funds – such as Vanguard Fidelity or Schwab – are available through any brokerage you're considering.

Banking: Some brokerages these days offer banking services such as checking accounts and mobile bill paying. If that's of interest to you see which brokerages offer it.

Convenience: Some brokerages exist online only so if you would like to do business at a physical location stick with those that have a local branch near you. Some of these factors will be more important to you than others. For example pay less attention to trading commissions if you trade very infrequently.

You can read reviews of good brokerages and compare them at our sister company The Ascent at TheAscent.com. Or use an online search engine searching for terms such as ""compare brokerages"" or ""best brokerages.""

My Dumbest Investment

Hot Stock Tips Can Burn: My dumbest investments have been stocks I bought after listening to tips from well-meaning friends. Needless to say they didn't turn out well. – I.G. online

The Fool responds: It's easy to be tempted to act on hot stock tips from friends or relatives – or even from strangers. It's best to exercise restraint though. For one thing any particular recommended stock might end up heading south instead of north taking a chunk of your money with it.

Keep in mind too that you don't necessarily know where the tip came from: It might be from your friend's friend who's a savvy investor – or from their dentist a mediocre investor who read some hype about the company online. It would be helpful to know just how good a track record the person recommending an investment has but that's probably a mystery. Even with financial talking heads on TV who are presented as investing experts we generally don't know how good or bad they are at stock-picking.

In general one of your best moves upon receiving a hot stock tip is to ignore it. The other is to do your own research into the company: See if it's healthy and growing if it has sustainable competitive advantages and if it's priced below what it's really worth. If you buy it after researching it you'll be making an informed decision rather than just taking your chances.

The Motley Fool Take

Testing testing: Is this stock on? Quidel (Nasdaq: QDEL) is a small but growing company focused on health diagnostics and testing including testing for COVID-19. The company had an outstanding 2020 with revenue more than tripling year over year due to huge demand for its COVID-19 offerings. Revenue for the first quarter of 2021 more than doubled over year-ago levels too.\u0009That's all exciting but the stock was recently down more than 60% from its 52-week high as investors see vaccinations taking hold and expect a slowdown in testing for COVID-19. Testing isn't likely to go away anytime soon though as much of the world is still not vaccinated and variants of the virus keep materializing.

Meanwhile Quidel has reached a distribution deal with McKesson to distribute its at-home COVID-19 tests which will open up more opportunities in the near future. More deals like this will drive revenue growth.

Quidel isn't a stock to just buy and forget about: Much depends on how long people will continue to need testing for COVID-19 as well as on how the company's business will adapt once the pandemic is really over. But at the very least – recently trading near 52-week lows and with a market value recently below $5 billion – Quidel looks to be a promising buy in 2021 with much room for growth. (The Motley Fool owns shares of and has recommended Quidel.)

Decoding Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Market Leadership and Innovation: Jack Henry & Associates Inc (NASDAQ:JKHY) stands out in the financial technology sector with its robust suite of products and services. The company's revenue growth of 5.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 as reported in the latest 10-Q filing is a testament to its strong market presence and the successful adoption of its solutions by nearly 1000 banks and over 700 credit unions. This growth is further bolstered by JKHY's strategic focus on innovation as evidenced by its significant investments in research and development which amounted to $35993 for the quarter. These investments are crucial for maintaining a competitive edge and fostering long-term customer relationships.

ADVERTISEMENT

Financial Health and Profitability: JKHY's financial health is a cornerstone of its strength with a solid balance sheet and an increase in net income to $87099 for the third quarter up from $81549 in the prior year. This financial stability is supported by a disciplined approach to cost management as seen in the total expenses of $426463 which have been effectively controlled in relation to the revenue growth. The company's profitability is not only a sign of operational efficiency but also provides the necessary capital to reinvest in growth initiatives and shareholder returns.

Weaknesses

Dependence on Financial Sector Clients: A primary weakness for JKHY is its reliance on the financial sector with a customer base predominantly composed of banks and credit unions. While this focus has contributed to the company's deep expertise and strong market position it also exposes JKHY to sector-specific risks such as regulatory changes and economic downturns that disproportionately affect the financial industry. Diversifying its client portfolio could mitigate this risk and provide more stability during industry fluctuations.

Increasing Operating Expenses: Despite robust revenue growth JKHY's operating expenses have also risen with a 6.6% increase in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. This uptick in expenses particularly in selling general and administrative costs which climbed by 7.0% may squeeze margins if not carefully managed. JKHY must continue to seek efficiencies and control costs to maintain its profitability and invest in strategic areas.

Opportunities

Technological Advancements: The ongoing digital transformation in the financial services industry presents significant opportunities for JKHY. By continuing to invest in cutting-edge technologies such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence JKHY can offer innovative solutions that address the evolving needs of its clients. The company's commitment to research and development as indicated by the $35993 investment in the third quarter positions it well to capitalize on these technological trends and expand its product offerings.

Market Expansion: JKHY has the opportunity to expand its market reach by targeting larger financial institutions and exploring international markets. With its strong product portfolio and expertise in the financial sector JKHY can leverage its reputation to attract a broader clientele. Additionally strategic partnerships or acquisitions could accelerate this expansion and introduce JKHY's solutions to new customer segments.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The financial technology industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. JKHY faces the threat of emerging fintech startups and established technology firms that are expanding their financial services offerings. To remain competitive JKHY must continue to innovate and differentiate its products while delivering exceptional customer service.

Economic Uncertainty: Economic downturns can significantly impact JKHY's client base leading to reduced spending on technology solutions and services. The company's dependence on the financial sector makes it vulnerable to such macroeconomic factors. JKHY must maintain a strong financial position and adapt its offerings to help clients navigate challenging economic conditions.

In conclusion Jack Henry & Associates Inc (NASDAQ:JKHY) exhibits a strong financial performance with notable revenue and net income growth. The company's strategic investments in technology and product development position it well to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities. However JKHY must address its reliance on the financial sector and manage operating expenses to mitigate weaknesses and threats. By continuing to focus on innovation and market expansion JKHY is poised to maintain its leadership in the financial technology space and deliver value to its stakeholders.

The pledge is part of the Cure Angelman Now initiative.

Ryan and Annie Jacob's son 2-year-old Grayson was diagnosed last year with the syndrome. Ryan Jacob now serves on the board of the foundtation which focuses on funding research into treatments.

Angelman syndrome affects one in 15000 people and is characterized by developmental delays including walking crawling and feeding issues. It affects speech. Often babies with Angelman syndrome don't coo or babble. Later speech is limited to a few words or it is absent. People with Angelman syndrome have sleep problems including abnormal sleeping cycles or less need for sleep. Seizures often begin between ages 18 months and 3 years.

It's caused by a problem in the UBE3A gene on chromosome 15 coming from the mother.

The Jacobs also recently made a $500000 donation to the ARC of the Capital Area a local nonprofit organization that works with people who have intellectual and developmental disabilities through case management and inclusion programs.

In an email to CBN News Fowler explained why he scheduled this event.

""A couple of years ago the Lord took me for a walk in the heavenlies over the Dallas Fort Worth Region. He said 'Find me a field fill it with people and I will fill it with my glory'"" the pastor explained. ""You see over the last 33 years I had prophesied about the coming awakening and revival and how I saw people pulling over on the side of the highway and falling on their faces giving their lives to the Lord. How I saw fields filled with thousands of people gathering in worship and prayer with miracles signs and wonders breaking out. How I saw tent revivals returning all over. I guess I thought the Lord was using me to stir up others He was calling to do it! However I had never really thought of doing this myself.""

""So after this encounter with the Lord my family and I set out to find the Lord a field. We drove and drove day after day all over the greater DFW region for almost 2 years looking for this field for the Lord"" Fowler continued. ""I'm happy to report that at the end of last year we found the Lord a field in Valley View Texas right on I35 only 39 minutes north of the DFW Airport the end of 2020 and we closed on it January of this year!""

He continues ""Recently I heard the Lord say 'Ask My people how bad do you want revival?' If you were able to attend the Welsh Revival Azusa Revival or Brownsville Revival would you do whatever it would take to be there? He went on to say 'Tell them well now you can be!' Although you can't go back in time to the revivals of old you can be a part of the Field of Glory Revival!""

Fowler adds ""The Lord has revealed to me that just as the Field of Glory is on I35 that this is going to be an I35 Revival = Isaiah 35. Blind eyes will open and deaf ears will hear. Then the lame will leap like playful deer and the tongue-tied will sing songs of triumph. A highway shall be there and a road And it shall be called the Highway of Holiness Isaiah 35 TPT. As the Lord instructed we found Him a field and now by His Grace we are going to fill the field with people then He will fill it with His Glory!""

For those who are unable to attend the revival in person CBN News will be streaming the event on our YouTube and Facebook pages and viewers can also watch Live on Dr. Fowler's Facebook and YouTube pages.

The lawsuit in State Supreme Court accuses the medical school of exhibiting a ""culture of indifference"" toward what happened to her said Lisa A. Coppola the woman's attorney.

She complained to university officials on three separate occasions but the university and medical school failed to investigate according to her lawsuit which was filed in March.

""It is wholesale failure to protect this female physician"" Coppola said. ""Sadly it’s not unusual in the discipline of medicine that women physicians suffer sexual harassment and otherwise but I would have expected more from our University at Buffalo here and the employer here. These were very serious allegations. And it’s as though they closed their eyes and ears to everything.""

The lawsuit – filed against the medical school University Resident Medical Services and Dr. Amir Akl – alleges violations of federal and state sex and gender discrimination laws. The circumstances created a hostile work environment subjected the woman to retaliation and inflicted mental anguish and emotional distress according to the lawsuit.

Akl denies any wrongdoing and he plans to file a counterclaim for defamation said Frank LoTempio III his attorney.

""Our client is vehemently denying all of these allegations"" LoTempio said.

University Resident Medical Services employs medical residents including the two involved in this case. In legal papers University Resident Medical Services denied allegations of wrongdoing.

UB also denied the allegations.

""The University at Buffalo takes all allegations of sexual violence and assault on and off campus very seriously"" spokesman John DellaContrada said in an email. ""Nothing is more important than the safety and welfare of the members of our community.""

The Buffalo News does not identify victims or alleged victims of sexual assault so it is not publishing the name of the woman who filed the lawsuit.

The lawsuit alleges the woman was abused and harassed by Akl from October through December 2019. That included nonconsensual sexual intercourse in November and December of that year.

""We characterized this as rape"" Coppola said.

The rape allegations will form the basis for the defamation claim LoTempio said.

The woman said the abuse and harassment started in the moments after she learned while at work of the death of a close family member according to the lawsuit. That was when Akl started ""stroking and caressing her back neck hair and shoulders"" according to the suit. ""He also pulled her hair placing his hands and fingers into her hair to do so. In the shock of the moment (she) had a difficult time processing what was happening to her.""

In November 2019 at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center on Bailey Avenue he screamed at her according to the lawsuit and then apologized after she started crying and told her to hit him according to the suit.

He also ""emotionally isolated"" her ""by placing demands on her time and controlling her"" according to the suit.

""What the evidence is going to show is that he was a manipulative actor here and because of her vulnerability at the time he was able to manipulate her into being submissive to him"" Coppola said. ""And that's what predators do.""

The woman confronted Akl about ""his inappropriate touching"" according to the lawsuit but he told her she was mistaken about his motivations and ""portrayed himself as a savior figure to help her through her grief.""

According to the suit the woman brought her concerns about Akl to UB officials three times: on Dec. 18 2019 when she told the director of her residency program; in January 2020 when she completed a performance evaluation of him; and this past February when she sent a letter through her attorney.

Coppola said the letter was sent to UB's Office of Equity Diversity and Inclusion the campus office that investigates reports of discrimination harassment and sexual violence. She said her client also expected her program director to bring the matter to that office's attention after their December 2019 conversation.

In response to the letter according to Coppola she was advised by an attorney for the university to contact the Office of Equity Diversity and Inclusion the same office that was already notified of the situation directly with the letter.

No one from the Office of Equity Diversity and Inclusion contacted the woman or interviewed anyone else Coppola said.

""In other words UB essentially admitted it never did an investigation back when our client originally made the report and now is blaming the victim for not following UB’s process when the victim already had done so"" Coppola said in an email. ""As a result rather than following UB’s clearly-flawed process we filed our lawsuit.""

UB's standard process when it receives a letter from an attorney alleging harassment or discrimination is to invite the client to contact the Office of Equity Diversity and Inclusion and schedule an interview so the university can start a full investigation DellaContrada the university spokesman said in an email. The investigatory interview is ""essential"" to understanding the allegations and conducting an informed effective investigation he said.

""EDI's policies prohibit disclosure of confidential information about an individual matter or investigation"" DellaContrada said in the email. ""The university will not disclose case-specific facts or details about any pending litigation.""

In 2019 the university received 62 reports of sexual violence. Of those 18 students pursued cases through the school's conduct process and nine individuals were found responsible and received disciplinary sanctions according to the university.

""As established by this data UB has acted and will continue to act on claims of sexual violence when these are reported to UB"" DellaContrada said. ""UB cannot act when a complainant does not provide sufficient information to allow us to know that they have experienced sexual violence and our ability to respond is limited when a complainant does not cooperate with the university’s process for conducting a full and effective investigation.""

In a written statement attorneys for University Resident Medical Services said medical residents are required to take mandatory annual sexual harassment prevention training and the company is ""committed to ensuring"" no discrimination or harassment takes place.

Attorneys for UB from the state Attorney General's Office are trying to get the lawsuit dismissed arguing State Supreme Court does not have the jurisdiction to consider the matter. Attorneys have asserted only the Court of Claims has jurisdiction to consider claims against UB and the medical school.

UB was both the woman's educator and employer so it had dual responsibilities to protect her responsibilities which are outlined in its own policies and procedures Coppola said.

On Wednesday afternoon a photo was captured of Pedro Pascal and Dakota Johnson kissing quite passionately on the streets of New York where Pascal was seen in a tan blazer and a brown dress shirt while Johnson wore a leather jacket over a white tee. Naturally the image of the two locking lips went viral leading fans to believe this was the sign of a new Hollywood relationship. Turns out it was all just a moment of movie magic.

The pair was caught smooching in TriBeCa as they filmed their new romantic comedy Materialists. Directed by Celine Song—whose debut feature film Past Lives was nominated for Best Picture this year—the upcoming flick follows the dynamic between a matchmaker a wealthy man she meets and her ex. In addition to Johnson and Pascal the movie also stars Chris Evans Zoë Winters Dasha Nekrasova Louisa Jacobson and Marin Ireland.

Materialists just began filming in New York in late April according to World of Reel. There is no confirmed release date yet but the movie is being distributed by A24 and produced by 2AM and Killer Films.

To make matters even more interesting about a week ago Johnson was seen filming a scene with costar Evans and in a few paparazzi photos the pair were captured kissing during their shoot as well. Materialists is clearly going to be a steamy film to say the least.

Johnson is fresh off the release of superhero film Madame Web while Evans just wrapped his Christmas action-comedy Red Ones which costars Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and is set to hit theaters on November 15. Meanwhile Pascal has a lot on his plate as he just finished filming Gladiator II in January and is also starring in the noir thriller Tropico which just began filming in April.

But there was more geniality than specificity in private meetings with Gov. J.B. Pritzker and legislative leaders just three weeks before a self-imposed May 24 spring session adjournment date.

Democrats were prepared to talk to Johnson about his Monday reference to $1 billion owed to Chicago Public Schools due to years of underfunding under the state’s school funding formula — but the issue wasn’t even broached during a nearly 30-minute meeting with the governor.

And the mayor’s controversial support for a new lakefront Chicago Bears stadium also wasn’t a focal point of the meeting.

Johnson told reporters he reminded Pritzker and legislative leaders that Chicago is the economic engine of the state and deserves its “fair share of resources.

“It’s also to continue to build relationships with the opportunity that we have in this moment as a state to really build the type of operation that speaks to equity injustice. This is a unique chance for us to do that” Johnson said of his trip. “So it’s a level-setting. It’s making sure that we’re building on relationships but it’s also clear that in order for the state of Illinois to be the great state that it is that the city of Chicago has to have its fair share of resources.”

Johnson called discussions with the Illinois General Assembly about the Bears “ongoing” dubbing Soldier Field a “structural damaged situation that really needs a solution.” The Bears last week met with Pritzker aides who highlighted their opposition to the plan. The governor’s office last week called the proposal a “nonstarter” after the meeting.

“And that’s what this is about providing solutions to a problem … like everything else I’ve inherited” Johnson said.

It was the Chicago mayor’s first trip to the state capitol since taking office. Johnson also met with Pritzker and legislative leaders in Springfield in April 2023 in a ceremonial visit weeks before he was sworn in.

Johnson defended the timing of his visit — and his late-in-the-game budgetary asks — saying “We’re at the right time.”

“You know when stuff gets done. So we’re down here at the right time” Johnson said.

Several members of the Chicago City Council Black Caucus also met privately with Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch on Wednesday in what was dubbed an informal city lobbying day. Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) the mayor’s hand-picked Education Committee chair said it marked the first time in five years that members of the caucus had come to Springfield.

“The thing we’ll do next year is we’ll come in January. We come earlier. We get earlier access” Taylor said. “We can get a lot of those things that we’re looking for.”

Taylor said her requests included funding for infrastructure and investments in education some narrower than the mayor’s.

“He’s advocating for some of the same things we are but remember it’s 50 other folks. It’s just 20 of us as the Black Caucus and so he’s advocating on the entire city. We have specific asks for the South and West sides” Taylor said.

“Him coming down is a great thing. Him coming down with us didn’t make or break us because now the other caucuses have to do their due diligence to come down here as well.”

During Johnson’s closed-door meetings the Illinois Senate Executive Committee quietly cleared an education measure that Johnson and the Chicago Teachers Union had opposed.

The bill was initially intended to stop the Chicago Board of Education from closing or making any changes to selective enrollment schools until 2027 when the board will be fully elected. It was a response to a resolution passed by the CPS board that called for a plan to invest in neighborhood schools and move away from school choice.

The measure the Senate committee passed Wednesday cleared the House last month. It included a moratorium on all Chicago school closings until 2027 — and it would also stop the Chicago Board of Education from changing standards of admission for selective enrollment schools. The measure must still clear the full Senate.

Johnson said he has had discussions with lawmakers to amend the measure: “Those amendments are being assessed and analyzed now.”

As for whether he felt snubbed by the Senate’s approval during his visit the mayor countered that he understood the “process.”

“There’s a process that the General Assembly goes through” Johnson said. “I understand that process and we’re going to stick to that process.”

Robert Sausedo has a long track record of increasing corporate revenue and now he is using those skills to fund programs that create jobs address the homelessness problem steer children away from gangs and feed people who are in need of groceries among many other things.

Sausedo serves Black communities around areas where he grew up. He spent his childhood in Jefferson Park and Arlington Heights and he attended St. Pauls Catholic School on Washington Boulevard just east of Crenshaw Boulevard. He started his business career selling copiers for Sharp Corporation and when he took two of Xerox Corporation’s largest accounts Xerox recruited him.

“I thought that if I went to Xerox put that on my record that’s like Apple today” he said. “If you have that on your resume that will carry you for a long time.”

During the 1990s Sausedo did very well in the clinical laboratory business.

“I took our territory from doing $40000 a year to $4 million a month in less than five years” he said.

Sausedo was later recruited into the energy efficiency business where he helped build Johnson Controls’ Los Angeles market to producing $100 million a year.

“What you know as going green or energy efficiency we were already doing that before it became popular” he said. “One of my flagship projects was the City of Compton. I wanted to make sure that Compton was one of the first Black cities to go green. Out of all of the thousands of cities across America American City and County Magazine does an annual award for eight cities and we were able to get Compton in 2016 the Local Government Award. We did about $4-5 million of capital improvements throughout the city.”

Sausedo owned an insurance agency and along with his wife they owned a health care consulting firm. He then went on to serve as Deputy for Agency Review and Support for then Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas.

“I did a lot of community engagement working closely with our development team” Sausedo said. “The project that they’re looking to build at Vermont and Manchester; the site with the 180 units mixed use and a transportational boarding school that Metro is participating in I was a part of that team to help get the community on board with that.”

In 2019 he was asked to take on the role of president and CEO of Community Build which was created in 1992 after the civil unrest to provide education training employment placement and support services to former gang members and other at-risk young people.

“Brenda Shockley who is the founding president did a phenomenal job of building a great chassis for me to build from” Sausedo said. “If you know anything about cars if you can find an old car with a good chassis you’re in good shape. When I came in there was 27-year old legacy of an African-American organization that had solid bones deep roots and had done a lot of great work over the years. So here I come with Community Build 2.0 positioning it for the next 25 years. Since I’ve been here we’ve been able to do a lot. I’ve doubled our revenues and our programming in the last two years. We’ve grown immensely. We’ve been able to provide direct employment between October of 2020 through the end of December to about 600 people through several different programs. In addition to that we helped the city with their programs so in total we helped 2700 people find jobs during the COVID crisis”

During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic Sausedo co-founded the Community Response System of South Los Angeles (CRSSLA). This group of community organizations and community leaders have given out more than 20 million pounds of food thousands of personal protective equipment over 2000 computer tablets to students and they have provided tutoring as children are attending school virtually.

“We’re sort of like the Red Cross of Urban America” he said. “In a recent conversation that I had with the Red Cross they recognized that they are not as robust in urban communities as they’d like to be. So we’re talking about a way to leverage what we’ve built for them to operate on this platform.”

Community Build was the first organization to open a Measure HHH (funds for construction to house the homeless) funded permanent supportive housing. The housing is at the intersection of Vermont Boulevard and 88th Street. The site has 62 units of permanent housing that supports homeless veterans homeless families and individuals and transitional youth. The site also has a youth center and mental health services. Sausedo plans to create more housing in the near future.

“We’re merging another organization into Community Build which will allow us to pick up an additional $3 million in assets in terms of real estate” he said. “We’ll be looking to build about 90 to 100 units of additional permanent housing. We are definitely becoming a player in the housing development market.”

Sausedo is expanding Community Build’s social enterprise platform by investing in legacy businesses in South Los Angeles turning those into employee owned businesses which can support Community Build’s programs. Community Build relies partially on government funding but Sausedo is working to make the nonprofit organization more self sustainable.

“When you’re very government-contract centric you run the risk of being out of business if the politics don’t rule in your favor” he said. “There are things that we can actually fund ourselves.”

Community Build is moving to form its own community development financial institution to support local small businesses and it is working on creating a first time home buyers’ program. Some of Community Build’s programs serve as fundraisers.

“One thing that I share with the employees here is as you develop programs always think of ways that we can productize what we do” Sausedo said. “Because at some point that can become a social enterprise. My lens that I look through isn’t just a lens of programs or just helping people. It’s how do I take what we’re doing today and scale it in a way that it becomes a business that can funds us.”

Community Build has job placement and creation programs. They recently hired 40 seniors who were looking to re-enter the workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic and they hosted a job fair where 33 people were hired at the event by four companies.

During the early stages of the pandemic Community Build hired 200 people to be census workers and a county grant allowed them to put 300 people on their direct payroll.

Community Build partnered with Dads Back Academy to hire 88 re-entry individuals as community health workers. The program is designed to decrease the prison recidivism rate by giving the formally incarcerated options that lead them away from committed crimes once they are free.

“They went from making $27 a month in prison to $22 an hour” Sausedo said.

Community Build’s efforts has been recognized by some major publications. Recently they were nominated as the Nonprofit and Corporate Citizen of the Year by the Los Angeles Business Journal. Also nominated was CRSSLA in their first year in existence.

JPM,JPMorgan Chase,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzJhN2MwNmE5LWE1YmMtNDc5ZS05NDI2LTgwOThhMzgzNTU1YdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How should companies decide on their ESG goals?,"Print this page

Not a day goes by without companies being pressured to take a stance in political debates. Long gone are the days when chief executives could echo the economist Milton Friedman in saying the only social responsibility of business was to increase its profits.

In the fourth-quarter earnings calls for 2020 more than one in four S&P 500 companies discussed environmental social and governance (ESG) objectives.

But should companies be involved in ESG and if so how should they decide the type and the level of their involvement?

There is a very simple answer: they should embrace these objectives whenever it is good for business. And when they would negatively affect the bottom line companies should ask their shareholders how much of their profit to sacrifice — and for which objectives.

Friedman opposed any social responsibility that did not add to the bottom line arguing that the ultimate cost was borne by shareholders and imposing it against their consent was tantamount to taxation without representation. If shareholders personally care about ESG they can use their dividends to pursue them.

Until recently this “separation principle” — maximise return and let shareholders do what they want with their money — has dominated not only the corporate world but also the asset management industry.

However as Oliver Hart and I argue there is a flaw in the argument: it is often cheaper for society as a whole not to pollute for example than to pollute and then clean up.

This approach creates scope for corporate ESG engagement but also sets the boundaries of when intervention is justified: only when a company has a greater impact than the sum of its stakeholders acting in concert. That raises the question of how companies should make this decision.

In a recent working paper Eleonora Broccardo Oliver Hart and I analyse how stakeholders can use their exit option (boycotting and divesting) and their voice option (voting for corporate action) to influence corporate behaviour towards their social goals.

We show that not only are boycotting and divesting unlikely to work; they are not even guaranteed to work in the right direction. A minority group can easily impose its will on the majority pushing a company in an undesirable direction. By definition this cannot happen if the decision is made through a vote.

Who should have that voting right? Paradoxically the best decision maker — the one most likely to produce a socially desirable outcome — is the stakeholder with the least money at stake.

A worker whose livelihood depends on a plant is less likely to prioritise the environmental damage it produces. A well-diversified shareholder is better positioned to resolve the options in the best way for society as a whole. The shareholder bears some of the cost but such a minimal component that they trade it off against the benefits — as a benevolent planner would.

Yet most shareholders barely have the time to vote in national elections. So how likely are they to be engaged in many hundreds of corporate proxies?

Fortunately there is an easy fix. Well-diversified shareholders do not own individual shares; they invest in mutual funds. If these funds differentiate themselves not just in their investment strategies but also in their voting behaviour investors can vote with their feet.

Environmentally conscious investors will put all their money into a “green” fund that commits to vote in favour of environmental proposals while those less environmentally engaged will invest in the “brown” fund which will vote against. For Pennsylvania-based Vanguard — the world’s second largest asset manager after BlackRock — the additional effort is trivial: just the cost of splitting the order on how votes are cast. The cost of putting a proposal on the ballot is small and many activist shareholders are already doing so. What they miss is investor support.

Unfortunately most investors today do not even know how their votes are cast. Even funds with an ESG label often vote systematically against shareholder proposals aimed at improving corporate ESG performance. If investors want to make a difference they should instead demand that their mutual funds support ESG proposals in companies with a bad record.

If mutual funds do not vote according to their preferences investors should move their money to others that do. By voting with their feet they can transmit their ESG preferences to the corporations in which their funds are invested without spending time to learn about the policies of thousands of companies.

One benefit of this idea is that it relieves corporate managers from making decisions for which they are not qualified. For example Jamie Dimon was chosen as chief executive of JPMorgan Chase for his business acumen rather than his political views. For him to take ESG decisions unguided would be anti-democratic dangerous and destructive.

It would be anti-democratic because he would have disproportionate political power removing it from legitimate elected representatives.

It would be dangerous because small activist groups could easily blackmail him into decisions that are not in the interest of the majority.

And it would be destructive because if he is known to yield that power he would spend most of his time assaulted by vested interests distracting him from the job for which he has been hired: to make money.

But Wall Street wants it to be even bigger. POLITICO's Kellie Mejdrich reports on an effort to open up access to Bitcoin investment.

In addition to pending fund proposals backed by Fidelity and Scaramucci’s SkyBridge One River Digital Asset Management is being advised by former SEC Chair Jay Clayton as it pitches a “carbon neutral” Bitcoin ETF. Clayton led the agency in the Trump era and didn’t sign off on any of the cryptocurrency fund proposals during his tenure. While in office Clayton highlighted concerns that cryptocurrency markets were ripe forfraud and manipulation and said that regulators had a host of issues to resolve before permitting ETFs.

The SEC which is responsible for allowing the funds to launch appears to be in no hurry to expand access to Bitcoin investments. The agency’s new chair Gary Gensler has emerged in recent weeks as a clear crypto skeptic. That surprised some advocates who were hoping he’d be more amenable to Bitcoin after teaching and researching digital finance at MIT.

Gensler has flagged fundamental concerns about the operations of the underlying cryptocurrency market that the ETFs want to track. He says exchanges that facilitate the buying and selling of digital currency aren’t adequately regulated and that market data is lacking.

“Altogether this has led to substantially less investor protection than in our traditional securities markets and to correspondingly greater opportunities for fraud and manipulation” Gensler said in House testimony Wednesday.

Despite the growing industry enthusiasm Wall Street is also split on the future of cryptocurrency. Some executives are dismissing the push to expand access even as their firms try to satisfy customer demand.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in House testimony Thursday that his company — the nation’s largest bank — was debating how to make it available in a safe way. But Dimon’s personal advice? “Stay away from it.”

“That does not mean the clients don’t want it” Dimon said. “It goes back to how you have to run a business. I don’t smoke marijuana but if you make it nationally legal I’m not going to stop our people from banking it.”

One of Gensler’s colleagues is urging him to act. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce a Republican on the agency’s five-member board said Gensler’s recent warnings “conveyed the overly conservative approach that has typified the SEC in the crypto arena.” She said the agency should move forward with approval of crypto funds on their merits.

Six applications are pending with the SEC to list cryptocurrency ETFs on stock exchanges run by the New York Stock Exchange and Cboe Global Markets. Wall Street titans are lining up to provide services for the funds including Morgan Stanley Bank of New York Mellon and State Street.

“Given the growth of the market and increased interest the stakes are high as people compete to be the first approved” Peirce said.

By not bringing digital currency into the regulatory mainstream Peirce and industry players say the SEC is allowing crypto activity to remain outside the purview of government watchdogs.

“What that does is it allows the wild Wild West to continue” said Tom Quaadman executive vice president of the U.S Chamber of Commerce Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness.

Jan van Eck the CEO of the $71 billion asset manager VanEck said those who oppose Bitcoin ETFs — like the one his firm is proposing — “are effectively forcing investors into inferior fund structures and less regulated venues.”

Critics of moving forward with the funds say the SEC needs to first address underlying risks in the cryptocurrency market.

“The regulatory concerns about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency markets go far beyond ETF issues” said Joseph Cisewski senior derivatives consultant and special counsel to the Wall Street reform group Better Markets. “The crypto exchanges operate almost entirely in the dark and we’ve repeatedly seen how risks increase and evolve when they are allowed to develop in the cracks of our regulatory system.”.

On Capitol Hill lawmakers from both sides of the aisle — including staunch Bitcoin advocates — are unconvinced or on the fence indicating that the SEC will face political pressure to continue to slow-walk the issue.

The companies “need to show their contribution to our economy and in that sense they really haven’t done well” Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said in an interview.

“I would caution the commission against prioritizing the review of cryptocurrency ETFs over fulfilling the legal directives of Congress” said Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) who leads SEC oversight in the House and wants the agency to finish rules languishing from the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.

Republican lawmakers who champion free markets and digital currency said in interviews that they too are taking time to study the issue before backing the efforts.

“I’m not clear yet on exactly what we should do” said Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) who in May launched the bipartisan Senate Financial Innovation Caucus to encourage policy development in crypto and other financial technologies.

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) who with Lummis serves on the Senate Banking Committee said he’s concerned about the accuracy of the underlying reference prices for the funds because crypto trading occurs on venues that aren’t regulated by the SEC.

James E. Clyburn chairman of the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis.

Congress is investigating fraudulent loans facilitated by fintech lenders BlueVine and Kabbage.

While fintech lenders only processed 15% of total PPP volumes they're involved in 75% of fraudulent loans identified by the DOJ.

Fintechs boasted fully-automated PPP applications and faster approvals than traditional banks.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Congress has opened a formal investigation into potentially fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program loans facilitated by online lenders like BlueVine and Kabbage.

The investigation follows reports from Bloomberg and ProPublica that looked into reports of allegedly fraudulent loans approved by lenders like Kabbage.

The House of Representatives' Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis announced the probe on Friday sending letters to BlueVine and Kabbage.

75% of PPP loans connected to fraud through a DOJ investigation were facilitated by fintech lenders the committee says in the letter citing a Bloomberg report. Those fintech lenders processed just 15% of total PPP volumes it said.

""I am deeply troubled by recent reports alleging that financial technology (FinTech) lenders and their bank partners failed to adequately screen PPP loan applications for fraud"" representative James E. Clyburn chairman of the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis said in a statement.

""This failure may have led to millions of dollars in FinTech-facilitated PPP loans being made to fraudulent non-existent or otherwise ineligible businesses.""

An investigation by ProPublica found that Kabbage facilitated 378 loans totalling $7 million to businesses that likely don't exist. Many of these fraudulent applications were tied to farms registered to residential addresses in areas like southern New Jersey and Palm Beach Florida.

While it was BlueVine and Kabbage's tech that processed the loan applications the fintechs themselves are not banks and therefore have partner banking relationships that support their lending businesses. BlueVine's partner bank Celtic Bank and Kabbage's partner Cross River Bank are both part of the subcommittee's probe.

The probe seeks to determine whether BlueVine Kabbage and their partner banks had adequate controls in place to prevent PPP funds from ending up in the wrong hands.

American Express acquired Kabbage in October 2020 though the deal did not include Kabbage's existing credit portfolio which included PPP loans. Kabbage's outstanding loans were transferred to a new entity called K Servicing.

A Kabbage spokesperson told Bloomberg it conducts ""rigorous verification checks"" that ""go well beyond the minimum requirements issued by the SBA."" For its part BlueVine told Bloomberg it ""conducted advanced fraud-prevention techniques"" and tried to ""safely support"" business owners.

Fintech lenders boasted that automation helped underserved small businesses

The rollout of the PPP an effort to buoy small businesses amid coronavirus pandemic-driven closures was less than smooth.







As businesses rushed to fill out applications for the forgivable loans the nation's largest banks like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo prioritized existing customers that had already gone through compliance processes.

That left many small businesses unable to access PPP loans. Ultimately many turned to fintechs including BlueVine Kabbage PayPal and Square.

These digital-only lenders boasted automated application processes with very little human intervention required which meant they were able to get business approved quickly.

But the majority of their PPP applicants were new customers meaning they hadn't already gone through the necessary compliance steps like 'know your client.'

98% of Kabbage's PPP borrowers were new clients. And Kabbage says that due to its ""commitment to data and technology to drive automation"" more than 75% of its approved loans were processed without human intervention.

Now Congress wants to know whether these fully-automated processes made fintechs the lenders of choice for fraud rings.

""A Bloomberg report points to multiple instances of fraud that could have been prevented had FinTechs simply conducted web searches for the company name of inactive nonexistent or otherwise clearly ineligible applicants"" the House subcommittee said in its letter to BlueVine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvanAtbW9yZ2FuLWpvaW5zLWNoYXNlLWluLXVrLWRpZ2l0YWwtYmFua2luZy1qOWR4Yzc3bDfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JP Morgan joins chase in UK digital banking,"A new bank is due to arrive in Britain this autumn but unlike some of the digital brands that have tried to challenge the established names in recent years this is a challenger with 200 years of history and a formidable reputation on Wall Street.

The Australia-based firm a $26 billion-valued industrial investor and developer that operates its North American operations out of Irvine is building a speculative 1.5 million-square-foot logistics campus at the former Kimberly-Clark tissue paper manufacturing site in Fullerton.



Construction is expected to be completed by spring 2022.

E-Commerce Demand



The project comes as Orange County continues to face a dearth of new industrial inventory; an issue exacerbated by rising demand from e-commerce users during the pandemic.



“Customer demand for strategically located space close to consumers making a positive contribution towards a more sustainable world has never been more important” said Anthony Rozic CEO of Goodman North America.



OC’s base of industrial buildings totals some 230 million square feet; vacancy rates here run just 2.5% and monthly asking rents are up 6% from year ago levels to $1.06 per square foot according to data from Voit Real Estate Services.



There was only about 350000 square feet of industrial space under construction in the county at the end of the first quarter according to Voit’s data making the Fullerton project a much-needed addition to the area.



Goodman’s property is at 2001 E. Orangethorpe Ave. a sprawling site near the intersection of the Orange (57) and Riverside (91) freeways and about 2 miles south of California State University Fullerton.



Goodman notes that tenants will be able to provide same-day delivery to a population of 20 million consumers with an estimated combined consumer purchasing power of $215 billion annually.



“These new facilities form part of Goodman’s ongoing commitment to invest in high-specification efficient and sustainable spaces in strategic locations providing customers with a competitive advantage and direct access to a large consumer-base” added Rozic whose firm has built several facilities in the Inland Empire that are currently leased to Amazon.



No leases for the new project in Fullerton have been announced yet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wb3N0Y3Jlc2NlbnQvbmFtZS9wZXRlci1sZWluaW5nZXItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MTk4NDY5MzHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peter Leininger Obituary (1936 - 2021) - Menasha WI - Appleton Post-Crescent,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/postcrescent/name/peter-leininger-obituary?id=19846931 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wb3N0Y3Jlc2NlbnQvbmFtZS9wZXRlci1sZWluaW5nZXItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MTk4NDY5MzHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbGVzb25saW5lLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdWstbmV3cy9oYXlmZXZlci1zdWZmZXJlcnMtd2FybmVkLXBvbGxlbi1ib21iLTIwNzA2ODc00gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsZXNvbmxpbmUuY28udWsvbmV3cy91ay1uZXdzL2hheWZldmVyLXN1ZmZlcmVycy13YXJuZWQtcG9sbGVuLWJvbWItMjA3MDY4NzQuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hayfever sufferers warned of 'pollen bomb' over Bank Holiday weekend,"We have more newsletters

Those who suffer with hayfever have been warned of high pollen levels this weekend as May draws to a close.

The sunny weather and Bank Holiday is drawing people outside after a damp spring.

But data from the Kleenex Pollen Forecast shows levels across the UK are continuing to rise moving into peak pollen season - potentially leading to a miserable wave of runny noses sore eyes and sneezing fits reports Bristol Live.

Sunny weather and temperatures up to 20 degrees are forecast this Bank Holiday both of which expected to contribute to higher pollen levels.

Kleenex Pollen Forecast

The severity of pollen levels is measured by Pollen Grains Per Cubic Metre (PPM).

A reading of 200-703 for tree pollen is considered high and anything above 704 very high.

Selected regions with currently high forecasts for tree pollen in the UK on Sunday include:

London: 277 PPM

Belfast: 285 PPM

Bristol: 267 PPM

Leeds: 272 PPM

Leicester: 289 PPM

Liverpool: 290 PPM

Manchester: 281 PPM

Nottingham: 288 PPM

The Kleenex Pollen Forecast provides a detailed pollen count for all 1.7 million postcodes across the UK three days in advance enabling those with hay fever to plan days out using pollen data specific to their local town or city rather than a broad national forecast.

Its data is sourced from Ambee which collates information from pollen traps across the country about local weather on the day and on different types of trees weeds and grass in a specific area.

Pollen tips

Amena Warner Head of Clinical Services Allergy UK has shared advice for hay fever sufferers on how they can manage symptoms when meeting friends and family in the garden pub or park:

Consider your wardrobe choices

Accessories like hats and wraparound sunglasses can stop pollen from reaching face hair and importantly eyes

Try using an allergen barrier balm

Some allergy sufferers find that applying an allergen barrier balm around the base of the nostrils and around sunglasses creates a barrier to airborne allergens

Schedule your daily outings carefully

Always check the Kleenex Pollen Forecast before leaving the house. Monitoring pollen levels daily can help you plan ahead to manage your symptoms

Shower when you return home

Pollen can stay on your skin and hair after you’ve been outside so take a shower as soon as possible when you return home

Always carry a pack of tissues with you

Ori Ben Shai Vice President and Managing Director Kimberly-Clark UK said: “We know how unpleasant hay fever can be and are delighted to continue our partnership with Allergy UK to help the UK’s 13 million hay fever sufferers this summer.

""The Kleenex Pollen Forecast offers unrivalled insight into local pollen levels and should be a big help for anyone struggling with allergies.

""We recommend that anyone with hay fever symptoms check pollen levels in their postcode daily to ensure they can prepare appropriately and need not hide inside while the sun is shining”.",,,,,,

According to a study conducted by Klarna which surveyed 15000 shoppers more of Gen Z is spending on skin care than of Millennials Gen X and Baby Boomers with 41.4 percent of respondents saying it was their top category.

“From an investment standpoint it’s beauty products and a routine but in our first time since reporting this data Gen Z spent more on skin care than the other generations” said Michela Griffin commercial lead beauty and accessories at Klarna.

“Younger generations of shoppers are hopping on this train of health consciousness and nurturing their skin. Instead of thinking about how to decorate their skin they’re thinking of ‘How do I make my skin look great in the long term?’ We call this ‘Mindful Shopping’ and we think it could potentially last for the next decade” Griffin continued.

That doesn’t mean color cosmetics have fallen by the wayside. Griffin added that Gen Z shopper has shown more interest in bright makeup palettes especially for eyes even if they’re more focused on skin care. Here see the top 10 skin care products wish-listed on the Klarna app.

The man explained on the Woolworths Facebook page he had already reported the incident to Kraft Heinz but decided to reach out the the supermarket giant due to the ""seriousness"" of the incident.

""Yesterday I decided to try the new ‘Bare Bones’ gravy with black garlic to accompany my Woolies pepper steak pre-packed roasted vegetables and Parmesan roasted potatoes"" he said on Facebook.

""Mid-way through the meal I experienced a horrendous situation in which I almost swallowed a nail that was concealed within the gravy.""

The man also shared photos of the nail and his meal saying he held on to the nail in case Woolworths or Kraft Heinz needed it for the investigation.

In a statement to Yahoo News Australia a Woolworths spokesperson said the company was aware of the customer's report and is engaged with the supplier to review the complaint.

""We encourage the customer to return the product to their local store for a full refund"" the spokesperson said.

A statement from Kraft Heinz to Yahoo News Australia said the company takes complaints like this one ""very seriously"" and an investigation will be launched.

“We are sorry about the experience the consumer has had here"" the statement said.

""This product passes through multiple filters and an x-ray machine capable of detecting metal so the likelihood of a nail being present as a result of the manufacturing process is extremely remote.

""We have noted that other pre-packaged products were consumed as part of the meal.""

Kraft Heinz said the company will conduct an investigation. Source: Facebook

The statement also said Kraft Heinz would be asking the customer to return the product and the nail so the appropriate tests could ben undertaken.

""The review process should be able to identify what has occurred in this situation” Kraft Heinz said.

Despite finding a nail in his food the Woolworths customer did indicate he would be happy to purchase the Bare Bones gravy again.

""The gravy actually tasted really good and I’d probably purchase it again… without added nails however!"" he wrote.

Investigation finds nail was not from gravy

Kraft Heinz followed through with the investigation and found the nail the man found in his food was not from the gravy.

In a statement to Yahoo News Australia Kraft Heinz revealed the metal item found in the gravy was not a nail but a rivet from the metal tongs he used to serve the meal.

So the metal item was not from the Bare Bones gravy as the customer initially thought.

""Kraft Heinz wishes to thank the customer for his cooperation in this matter and has provided him with a new packet of Bare Bones gravy as he indicated that he had very much enjoyed this product"" the statement from. Kraft Heinz said.

Store closures unemployment and lawsuits have followed in their wake.

The first of these laws passed in late January by the Long Beach California City Council mandated that grocery workers at large stores get a $4-an-hour pay raise for the duration of the pandemic. By early February Kroger announced it was shutting down two stores in Long Beach.

The locations had already been underperforming the company said but the new pay hike meant they were now unsustainable. It was the same story in Seattle and Los Angeles: In response to ""hero pay"" laws Kroger said it would close three stores in each city.

Many independent stores that remain open say these policies have pushed them deep into the red. One analysis by Capitol Matrix Consulting (and commissioned by the California Grocers Association) found the laws have increased labor costs by an average of 30 percent.

Grocery store associations in California and Washington are suing every city that requires ""hero pay."" They argue that such mandates are preempted by federal labor law and violate the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.

The grocery store unions that push these laws and the politicians who pass them scoff at store owners' arguments. Grocery store profits they note are way up during the pandemic. They argue that the store closures are merely an intimidation tactic.

Grocery stores ""absolutely should be paying this increase"" said Los Angeles City Councilmember Paul Kortez. ""And if they shut down stores it's just out of spite."" It's a strange argument that companies would be greedy enough to resist giving affordable pay increases to their employees but not so greedy that they don't mind closing profitable stores just to make a point.

Even with record pandemic profits grocery stores operate on very slim margins. Big sudden increases in expenses have to be absorbed somewhere. Those stores with the least room to make up added costs are the most at risk of being shuttered.

Most supermarkets of course will survive likely through a combination of price hikes layoffs and employee hour reductions. These consequences are a compressed version of what we'd expect from the much-discussed idea of raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour: pay raises for many workers job losses for others and higher prices and fewer options for consumers. Unlike with a minimum wage increase however the costs of ""hero pay"" laws are obvious immediate and visible to everyone.",,,

Gwen Shamblin Lara husband Joe Lara church leaders David and Jennifer Martin Jonathan and Jessica Walters and Lara’s son-in-law Brandon Hannah were on the plane when it crashed into Percy Priest Lake around 11 a.m. according to the Rutherford County Fire & Rescue.

Gwen Shamblin Lara died Saturday.

The private jet had taken off from Smyrna Airport just outside of Nashville and was headed for Palm Beach Florida.

All seven on board are presumed dead and officials began pulling airplane debris and human remains out of the lake Sunday.

Shamblin who founded Remnant Fellowship Church in 1999 after the success of her Christian diet program “The Weigh Down Workshop” was dogged by accusations that her church was more of a cult than a religious institution according to News 5 in Nashville. Followers claimed to view her as a prophet and the station previously reported a recording in which she praised parents for locking up their child as a form of obedience training.

The Central Pasco Employment Village a 2400-acre swath of land with 13 separate property owners was organized more than a dozen years ago under a common set of development rules. The land is at the center of public debate over which should come first: businesses and industries that bring jobs or housing for the people working in those jobs.

One landowner the Swope family has snagged interest from Lennar Homes to construct hundreds of homes on an 83-acre portion of their land. That prompted a request to change several sections of the comprehensive plan language which created the employment village.

It’s a move that has drawn criticism from Bill Cronin president and chief executive officer for the Pasco Economic Development Council.

At a recent Pasco Planning Commission meeting the issue brought sharp criticism from Joel Tew the attorney representing the property toward Cronin. The item divided planning commissioners; they ultimately voted three to two to recommend that the comprehensive plan changes be denied by the County Commission. County commissioners could have their first of two hearings on the changes June 8.

The employment center parcel is located south of State Road 52 stretching from the Collier Parkway Extension to Bellamy Brothers Boulevard. The portion identified for construction of commercial and industrial uses runs along the highway. Housing was projected to go in to the south of those businesses and industries.

The agreements that created the village in 2008 tied all 13 property owners together under a complex set of rules and shares of the roughly 4500 residential units that could someday be constructed in the area.

Tew said his client wants to see several of the rules changed. But the one issue that dominated the discussion and sparked controversy revolves around development of the commercial and industrial properties.

In their presentation to planning commissioners Tew and Pat Gassaway of Heidt Design representing the Swope family argued that the employment center rules to build business shell buildings on the commercial sites first are not practical and have attracted no interest. To provide the road and utility line infrastructure for the Swope family parcel alone will cost more than $13 million.

They suggested making the changes that would allow Lennar to develop housing first and pay to get that infrastructure in place. Then businesses could come to the adjacent properties without the financial burden. To do anything else Tew said would be “insanity.”

Several professionals who market such sites also weighed in saying it was not realistic to expect the business development without having the infrastructure there in the first place.

Cronin disagreed.

He told the planning commission that he is working with one of the original landowners in the employment village who is planning to construct a 500000-square-foot facility on one of the business sites. While Cronin couldn’t get into details of the negotiation he said the project proves that the industrial and business lands can successfully be marketed by those willing to build infrastructure and a business facility on a site.

In fact Cronin said while some companies see having infrastructure in place as a key feature to a site others are immediately concerned about housing already built adjacent to a potential location.

Cronin noted that at that very same planning commission meeting they had all witnessed dozens of residents vehemently opposing commercial encroachment on their neighborhood — a scenario that would make potential business clients cringe.

“It is the Central Pasco Employment Village” Cronin said. “It is not the Central Pasco residential village.”

Cronin also said that when the Economic Development Council examined 67 potential future business development sites to get certified under the organization’s “ready site” designation the Central Pasco Employment Village ranked first with its large tracts of available land its location on an important state road and its proximity to Interstate 75.

Cronin’s opposition was echoed by Sheriff Chris Nocco. In a letter Nocco voiced his continuing concern that each new residential area developed in Pasco was expanding the need for his services.

Tew told planning commission members that the example Cronin gave of the one parcel planned for the 500000-square-foot business was not a valid argument. Since that site is at the corner of Bellamy Brothers Boulevard utility lines are already nearby significantly cutting the cost of development.

Tew also said he “was very upset about what has happened today.” He said he had spoken with county administrator Dan Biles and understood that if his client agreed to look at having sites certified under the Economic Development Council’s “ready site” plan that Cronin would not continue to object to changes in the comprehensive plan.

Without the changes the land would continue to sit undeveloped Tew argued. He said that Cronin had “reneged backtracked and ambushed us.”

Cronin responded that he did not make any such agreement. He said it came down to “a trust Issue” and that his job is to create jobs.

“This is not a behind-the-scenes horse trading kind of maneuver” Cronin said noting that the proposed changes fly in the face of the site’s original concept.

“Infrastructure is not a substitute for a building and employment center” Cronin said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hcGxlc25ld3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L21vbmV5L3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLzIwMjEvMDUvMjkvYXZlLW1hcmlhLWNvbnRpbnVlcy1pdHMtcmVjb3JkLWJyZWFraW5nLXNhbGVzLTIwMjEvNzQyODQ5MTAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ave Maria continues its record-breaking sales in 2021,"Submitted

Sniper ATP will be located on the Weapon Station 5 an area on the aircraft where pods or weapons attach and is expected to be fielded with the aircraft in late 2023.

This integration gives existing and future Super Hornet fleets the ability to add Sniper ATP’s precision targeting and surveillance capabilities which are critical to pilot survivability.

“Integrating Sniper ATP onto Weapon Station 5 commonly known as the ‘cheek station’ brings state-of-the-art tracking algorithms two-way-data-link and many other capabilities to the Kuwait F/A-18E/F crews that will positively impact the overall success of their missions” said Kenen Nelson director of Fixed Wing Sensor Programs at Lockheed Martin’s Missiles and Fire Control.

“This also means that all F/A-18E/F customers will have the option of a reliable easily maintainable and modern targeting pod.”

To verify the mechanics of the system flight testing with a non-operational Sniper ATP was conducted at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland in March. Subsequently flight-testing with an operational Sniper ATP was conducted at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in California in March. Both first flight tests were successful.

“The Sniper ATP provides an additional tool in the already robust Kuwait F/A-18 Super Hornet package” said Jessica Idleman Boeing program manager Kuwait F/A-18 program. “The Super Hornet provides the warfighter with enhanced situational awareness and Sniper ATP is an important part of our technology insertion plan and future growth of the platform.”

Currently Sniper ATP flies on both the Kuwait F/A-18C/D and Canadian CF-18 Hornets. As the Kuwait Air Force transitions to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet they will benefit by receiving the new capabilities that the latest Sniper ATP configuration provides to the Super Hornet fleet. There are currently more than 27 countries and 15 different types of aircraft operating with the platform-agnostic Sniper ATP.

The modular design field-proven reliability (Sniper ATP exceeds 500 hours Mean Time Between Maintenance Events and a world-class depot partnership with Robins Air Force Base Ga. makes Sniper the lowest Life Cycle Costs targeting pod on the market.

The Military Is Drooling at the Thought.,"The F-35 already has a 'beast mode.' What would hypersonic weapons add to the equation?

Here's What You Need To Remember: It will take some reconfiguring to make these two weapons compatible.

The U.S. military could hang more weapons under the wings of its F-35 stealth fighters.

Lockheed Martin which assembles the single-engine radar-evading jets in early May 2019 revealed a concept for a hypersonic surface-to-air missile that’s compatible with the U.S. Navy’s F-35C.

Lockheed for years has been working with the U.S. Air Force and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to develop the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept hypersonic missile. “HAWC which has so far been under development as a land-attack weapon is set to fly for the first time before the end of the year” Joe Trevithick reported at The War Zone.

The artist's conception of an F-35C firing a HAWC derivative first appeared at the Navy League's annual Sea Air Space convention just outside of Washington D.C. on May 6 2019. The rendering shows the stealth aircraft configured to carry two of these weapons externally one under each wing. .... As its name suggests HAWC is an air-breathing weapon that flies at hypersonic speed which is typically defined as anything above Mach five. The Air Force and DARPA have said that missile will use a rocket booster to accelerate to at least that speed after which a high-speed scramjet engine will kick in and ensure it maintains a speed between Mach five and 10.

HAWC apparently is too big to fit in the F-35’s internal weapons bay. To minimize the F-35’s radar signature Lockheed designed the plane to carry weapons internally. But the fighter’s dense internal layout doesn’t leave a lot of space for munitions.

The Air Force’s F-35A and the Navy’s F-35C internally can carry no more than four AIM-120 air-to-air missiles although Lockheed is developing a special rack that could boost this number to six.

The U.S. Marine Corps’ vertical-landing F-35B which features a downward-blasting lift engine that the other variants lack has a smaller weapons bay and internally can carry only two AIM-120s and also is too small for the special rack.

But all the F-35 variants also come with underwing hardpoints. Crews can hang tons of missiles and bombs from the wings albeit at the cost of the F-35’s radar stealth. The U.S. military even has a nickname for this configuration: “beast mode.”

The F-35As the Air Force in May 2019 deployed to the Middle East for operations targeting Islamic State in Iraq and Syria frequently fly in beast mode. Islamic State forces lack significant air defenses.

The Air Force released photos of the F-35s in the Middle East externally carrying six GBU-49 laser-guided bombs and two AIM-9X infrared-guided air-to-air missiles.

HAWC for one clearly is a beast-mode-only weapon “which would effectively eliminate [the F-35’s] stealth qualities” Trevithick wrote. “However the speed and range of hypersonic weapons give them an intrinsic stand-off capability making this a less pressing issue.”

HAWC could arm other warplane types of course Trevithick pointed out.

HAWC or a maritime strike variant thereof could just as easily be an option for other Navy fighter jets such as the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet underscoring the reality that fighters will increasingly be carrying outsized stand-off weapons as time goes on. Larger platforms such as the Navy's P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft might find themselves carrying HAWC follow-on variants too. An anti-ship variant could also find a home in the Air Force on that service's B-1 or B-52 bombers the former of which are already able to carry Lockheed Martin's AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile giving them a significant new maritime strike role. … But at the moment any actual follow-on variants of HAWC still seem to be a ways off. At present HAWC is in a ""race"" with another U.S. military hypersonic weapon program Tactical Boost Glide to see which will fly first. DARPA is developing TBG which is an unpowered boost-glide vehicle together with the Air Force and the U.S. Navy for air- and ship-launched applications respectively.

And because the satellite's surface is coated with regolith — large rocks and dust — these future landing missions could be difficult and potentially dangerous.With this new transformable lunar robot the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) hopes to acquire additional data on the lunar surface. The information obtained will contribute to the Lunar Cruiser's development the agency's pressurized rover announced two years ago.Set to launch in 2022 the robot will be transported by Japanese company ispace's lunar lander. Once on the Moon it will take photos of the regolith and dust and send them to the mission control center via the lunar lander. The transformable have an 80 mm (3 inches) diameter (almost the size of a baseball) and will weigh around 250 g (about half a pound).According to JAXA the yet unnamed robot can turn from its ball shape into a running form after landing contributing to a reduced volume during transportation. It's still a sphere but judging from its design it will use some sort of wheels to move around the rough terrain.JAXA plans to land its Lunar Cruiser on the Moon by 2029 and the data collected by this small robot ball will help scientists better prepare for the future mission. Until then we are waiting on GM and Lockheed Martin to roll out their buggy  which already has its lunar landing scheduled for 2024.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3Qvd2hhdC1oZWxsLXJ1c3NpYSVFMiU4MCU5OXMtbWlnLTE0NC1qZXQtdHJ1ZS1zdGVhbHRoLWZpZ2h0ZXItMTg2NTEy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What the Hell: Is Russia's MiG 1.44 Jet a True Stealth Fighter?,"Though intended as a stealthy jet a few features call into question the degree to which the MiG 1.44 can be considered a stealthy design

Here's What You Need to Remember: Russia’s stealth ambitions are…grounded. One of their newest heavy fighters/interceptors the Su-57 has had a number of teething issues. The Su-57 fleet totals only about a dozen airframes.

In response to the United State’s Advanced Tactical Fighter program — which spawned the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor — the Soviet Union initiated a crash project to produce a comparable fighter. What they got was the MiG 1.44.

Jack of All Trades

Like the F-22 Raptor  the MiG 1.44 was supposed to do it all. On paper at least the MiG combined stealthy characteristics with excellent maneuverability which designers hoped would result in excellent fighting capabilities.

In addition to weight-saving materials used in airframe and wing construction radar-absorbent materials were incorporated on the airframe with special attention given to the airframe’s radar “hotspots” like the wing edges and engine intakes.

Rather than straight-through engine intakes the MiG 1.44’s were curved “serpentine” intakes that could bounce incoming radar inside them hopefully dissipating or eliminating a return signal.

Despite a few stealthy characteristics the MiG 1.44 may not have been all that stealthy.

Stealthy — or Not?

Though intended as a stealthy jet a few features call into question the degree to which the MiG 1.44 can be considered a stealthy design. One of these is the MiG’s canards.

Canards are control surfaces — essentially ‘winglets’ usually just aft or below the cockpit that provide additional lift or aid in control during certain flight scenarios. Although not incompatible with stealthy designs they are not ideal and can amplify an airframe’s radar signature.

Popular Science explains why airframes with a canard design are difficult to make stealthy. “Designing a stealthy canard is difficult particularly if the canards are big enough to enable the airplane to recover quickly from an extreme nose-up attitude.” This is due to the extra surfaces that can return a radar signal — more surfaces more return signal.

The issue is the MiG’s apparent canard-wing (mis)alignment. Stealthy jets like the F-22 Raptor minimize the radar reflection of control surfaces like wings and tail assembly. When viewed from a head-on position the F-22’s tail assembly is ‘hidden’ behind the wings reducing the number of surfaces that would be visible to radar.

The MiG 1.44 does not follow this design principle. When viewed from the front the two canards are not on the same horizontal plane as the wings creating a “louder” or more reflective radar signature — and possibly compromising its stealth characteristics.

Oddly the MiG 1.44 had prominent pylons on its wings for attaching weapons or fuel tanks — which would have further decreased the jet’s stealth. The F-35 can optionally carry fuel or ordinance on its wings but when not in use the pylons are removed so as not to degrade stealth.

Another Stolen Bird?

In an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency Sputnik a Russian defense commentator said that he believed China’s Chengdu J-20 makes use of some of the MiG 1.44’s features.

""In my opinion the machine is based on the Russian MiG 1.44. That plane was created to compete with the PAK FA at the preliminary design stage and made its maiden flight in 2000. The Chinese plane is very similar"" the commentator explained.

“Although it hasn't been announced officially the J-20 uses our AL-31F engine developed by Salut which the Chinese bought for half a billion dollars” a nod to Russia and China’s budding — if contentious — defense relationship.

All for Naught?

Russia’s stealth ambitions are…grounded. One of their newest heavy fighters/interceptors the Su-57 has had a number of teething issues. The Su-57 fleet totals only about a dozen airframes. Though certainly a more refined design than the MiG 1.44 stealth appears to be easier to say than to do.

PORTLAND Ore. — A man was shot and killed in the parking lot of the Lowe's home improvement store near Delta Park in North Portland Saturday evening police said.

Officers found the man dead at around 6:40 p.m in the parking lot of the store located in the 1100 block of North Hayden Meadows Drive east of Interstate 5.

Police have not revealed what led to the shooting but everyone involved stayed at the scene they said.

Police are hoping to contact anyone who witnessed the shooting and left before speaking with them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vaG9sbHl3b29kbGlmZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8zMC9rYXRpZS1sb3dlcy1pbnRlcnZpZXctaW52ZW50aW5nLWFubmEtc2NhbmRhbC1yZXVuaW9uL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vaG9sbHl3b29kbGlmZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8zMC9rYXRpZS1sb3dlcy1pbnRlcnZpZXctaW52ZW50aW5nLWFubmEtc2NhbmRhbC1yZXVuaW9uL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Katie Lowes Teases New Show ‘Inventing Anna’ Has The ‘Special Sauce’ Of A Shondaland Show,"Katie Lowes is staying in the Shondaland family and she has no plans of leaving. The Scandal star is starring in Shonda Rhimes’ new Netflix series Inventing Anna which follows the whirlwind rise and fall of Anna Delvey. She will also be tackling comedy in the upcoming CBS series Smallwood. HollywoodLife chatted EXCLUSIVELY with Katie about her exciting Shondaland project and more.

“First of all I’ll follow her [Shonda Rhimes] and go with her to the ends of the earth. Wherever she wants to go I’m there” Katie told HollywoodLife while promoting Red Nose Day. “It was really cool. It has all the special sauce that makes a Shondaland show a Shondaland show. I think we even saw it with Bridgerton. There’s still that sort of that page-turny OMG moments that they do so you can’t wait for the next one. I think everyone’s going to finish the hell out of this show. It’s exciting because it’s streaming which means there can be like an F-bomb here or there or this next scene doesn’t have to end. They don’t have to abide by the network standards and practices so it might even be saucier and steamier.”

The series will be released on Netflix and also stars Julia Garner Laverne Cox Anna Chlumsky and more. The series was created and produced by Shonda. Katie first joined the Shondaland world when she was cast as Quinn Perkins on Scandal in 2012. The show came to an end in 2018 after 7 crazy and twist-filled seasons. Despite the show ending the Scandal cast will always be family.

“We’re on a huge chain with all of the Scandal actors and all of our significant others because we really truly were a family” Katie said. “A lot of us got married on that show had babies on that show met our people on that show. We really were a very tight-knit family. Before COVID we had a huge Scandal reunion at George Newbern’s house and we all had a big sleepover party. It was the most fun ever. Since COVID all of us are quarantining in different countries half of us are working in Canada and all this stuff. I was just about to send a text to the chain being like when is the Scandal reunion? Are we all hanging out? My goodness we better plan something big for the 10-year anniversary.”

When the show ended Quinn got her happy ending with Charlie and Robin. Olivia also left Quinn in charge of Olivia Pope & Associates which is now Quinn Perkins & Associates. Katie revealed what she thinks Quinn is doing today. “I think she’s doing an exceptional job” Katie said. “I think she’s kicking ass and taking names at running OPA and doing all the PR dirty underground tricks to make Washington D.C. run smoothly. I think she would always want to make Olivia Pope proud. I think motherhood is probably really hard for her. I think she probably has a wonderful nanny who helps run some semblance of a household. But I also think Quinn has cameras everywhere. I guess she and Charlie have ridden off into the sunset with all of their torture devices but I don’t know how they’re ever going to tell their baby girl Robin what they do for a living. Maybe we’ll see that in a Scandal reunion.”

Katie also spoke with HollywoodLife about working with Walgreens and Red Nose Day. She revealed why Red Nose Day is so important to her.

“Kids have really been such a huge part of my life and really pulled at my heartstrings that I’m just so blown away by what Walgreens and Red Nose Day have been able to do” Katie told HollywoodLife. “Do you know they’ve raised $240 million in the past 7 years where Walgreens has been the exclusive place that partners with Red Nose Day? I just feel like they’ve pivoted so well in the pandemic because when it used to be Red Nose Day you could go to Walgreens and pick up your red nose and donate to Red Nose Day and put it on. Of course that is not COVID safe. They’ve done an incredible job of pivoting digitally where you get an awesome filter of the red nose which I posted on my Instagram feed and it’s so freaking adorable. If you don’t know about Red Nose Day what’s so cool about it is that 100 percent of the proceeds go to helping kids in every area so I’m talking poverty food educational services shelter transportation all of these things that help our kids. Now in the pandemic kids need help more than ever and I’m just so proud to be a part of it. They’ve made it so easy for people to donate. You can still donate in person when you’re checked out and you’re shopping for all your other stuff at Walgreens you can do it on the Walgreens app or you can do it at walgreens.com/rednoseday. I just can’t believe the work that they’ve done. Again spanning all of these different places where kids are in need and have done such an amazing job over the past seven years raising $240 million and it ends this year. It ends Monday May 31 so come on guys we’ve got the weekend to keep on donating and keep raising money.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uai5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8wNS9tZW1vcmlhbC1kYXktMjAyMS1zdG9yZS1ob3Vycy1mb3Itd2FsbWFydC10YXJnZXQta29obHMtbWFyc2hhbGxzLW1hY3lzLWhvbWUtZGVwb3QtbG93ZXMtYmVzdC1idXktYW5kLW1vcmUuaHRtbNIBoQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uai5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8wNS9tZW1vcmlhbC1kYXktMjAyMS1zdG9yZS1ob3Vycy1mb3Itd2FsbWFydC10YXJnZXQta29obHMtbWFyc2hhbGxzLW1hY3lzLWhvbWUtZGVwb3QtbG93ZXMtYmVzdC1idXktYW5kLW1vcmUuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Memorial Day 2021 store hours for Walmart Target Kohl’s Marshalls Macy’s Home Depot Lowe’s Best Buy an,"Memorial Day 2021 is on Monday May 31.

The local brewery long located at 216 S. Michigan St. next to the State Theatre in downtown South Bend had been forced to close in late February because of a leaky roof that poured in through the ceiling and left standing water on the floor. Owners had already made headway on moving some items into their new location in the Hibberd building at 321 S. Main St. but the disruption in business was the last straw for a contentious relationship between owner Steve Lowe and building owner Richard Ejemenye of Toscana Capital Group who purchased the building last year.

More:South Bend to demand that State Theater owner fix the leaking roof

""We were lucky that the ownership group over there was already so terrible that we had made plans"" Lowe said. ""And that's what it was we had to get out of there as fast as we could.""

In March Lowe reached out to mug club and community members where together they moved out the last of the local brewery's goods. People carried 50 kegs of beer that each weigh approximately 160 pounds up the narrow stairway from the previous location's basement and onto trucks and trailers to make the two block trek. In two trips it was done.

""We were able to get everything over here and we were able to get it put away"" Lowe said. ""And that was a big relief getting out of there was a huge relief.""

Despite dealing with unpleasantries from his former landlords Lowe still wanted to bring some familiarity of the location to his new space which will open to the public June 2.

""When you walked in the front door we wanted you to feel like you are still walking into Brew Werks"" Lowe said.

Neighboring Ragamuffin on the far west side of the building South Bend Brew Werks' customers are prompted to walk through the large outdoor patio and welcomed by the large familiar bar with mug club glasses hanging on the far side and chalkboard menus that will routinely be updated with what's on tap just as it was in the old location.

The community partners board has a more prominent spot in the new space to show customers where donations are going for the Beer 4 Good program and the original (now non-functioning) tap system is placed just below.

Touches from the Hibberd building itself have been added with old hand railings refurbished to become foot railings below the bar and former office doors have now become doors that lead into the brewery in the back. Lowe and his wife Michele also found other items like church pews and an large hutch to repurpose and fill the space.

""It was one of those things where we wanted to find and reuse something and give it a new life"" Steve Lowe said. ""That this is still what this has been about anyway at Brew Werks — we've got new stuff that's shiny but we've also tried to incorporate some old stuff to give it new life.""

The new 2700-square foot space can fit about 75% more people inside compared to the previous location with current seating capacities at 70 inside and 40 outside. The biggest footprint upgrade has been in the kitchen where the space is now 400 square-feet compared to about 150 square-feet. The food menu has been kept the same with the only new addition of a peperoni flatbread.

""We do have plans to revamp the menu sometime either this ear or next year with more options and look around to what's available"" Lowe said. ""Right now we didn't want to change a whole lot. We were shut down and turning back on over here and wanted to make it as familiar as possible to everybody. .. We still wanted it to still feel like Brew Werks for customers and employees as well.""

While the tap system is slightly smaller at the new location with 16 taps available compared to the 20 previously familiar options are still available like Stargazer IPA and Amistad Cream Ale. In anticipation for the opening Wednesday Lowe has also created a rye IPA made with centennial hops.

Overall the Lowes are excited to reopen noting that with every update and post on the business' social media page the community has come through with support.

""So many people were willing to help us out because we were already stressed about trying to build out a new space and we've never done this before"" Lowe said. ""And then on top of that the scramble to get out of the other spot. The last thing I wanted to be doing right then and there was to be going to code enforcement hearings. To get all that behind us we wouldn't have been able to do that without all the support of everyone reaching out and just trying to do whatever they can.""

South Bend Brew Werks will be open Wednesday through Thursday from 4 to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday from noon to 11 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 8 p.m.

According to a 2017 press release from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Asplundh Tree Experts now reportedly worth $5 billion pleaded guilty to employing workers it knew were using false identification papers and received the fine.

According to the release upper managers “remained willfully blind while lower level managers hired and rehired employees they knew to be ineligible to work in the United States.”

The company paid $80 million in criminal forfeiture and $15 million in civil payment.

The $95 million total is still the recordholder for the largest immigration judgment in history.

The family name came under the microscope again this week when Katherine Driscoll Asplundh — who married Cabot Asplundh on April 27 — allegedly tried to bully a user with the name Katherine Asplundh into signing over the rights to her Instagram handle.

According to screenshots of the conversation posted to the NYCInfluencesnark sub Reddit the new Katherine Asplundh started off with a breezy message.

“Hi just wondering if I could purchase your username from you” the newlywed wrote.

“I just got married and this is my new name.”

The other Katherine Asplundh kindly refused.

“Hi congrats! That’s my name too” she wrote. “I just googled and it said selling my username would get me banned from Instagram.”

From there things deteriorated between the two Katherine Asplundhs.

“I purchased my username in the past actually that’s not true” responded the billionaire’s wife.

“Celebrities do it all the time that’s how they all have their handles as their full names. So weird I didn’t know there was another Asplundh’s family out there [sic]. There no Katherine Asplundh in our family.”

Upon receiving no response the billionaire’s wife pointed out that the other Katherine wasn’t very active on Instagram and should therefore change her name to accommodate her.

The other Katherine then told the billionaire’s wife that the account was a “finsta” or fake Instagram that she uses for private stories and archiving photos and that her main account uses her maiden name.

Irritated Driscoll-Asplundh argued that the other woman’s name wasn’t really Katherine Asplundh and that she would be reported.

“I actually don’t believe that your name is Katherine Asplundh who would make their finsta their actual name? I reported you to Instagram and they’re actually able to tell me your real name I really hope I don’t know you because that’s gonna be really embarrassing for you.”

Driscoll-Asplundh then demanded to see documentation that the other woman was not lying about her name.

You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

Heather Poole courtesy Heather Poole

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space. So remember that next time you’re searching for the cheapest flight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida HBCU backs away from dubious $237M donation,"“With regards to the gift and the processing of it and so forth in terms of future processing we’ve already decided it’s in our best interest to put that on hold” Robinson said during the meeting.

The alleged windfall donation to FAMU came from Batterson Farms Corporation’s Gregory Gerami and the Isaac Batterson Family 7th Trust and would’ve almost tripled the school’s endowment helping students and faculty for generations. But after the announcement was made — with major fanfare during a Saturday commencement ceremony — skepticism quickly quelled the celebration.

For one Batterson Farms Corporation appears to be a relatively small outfit based in Texas selling hydroponic hemp farm products leading some to question how its stocks could be worth millions. The doubts have been heightened by reports about Gerami’s past dealings including a $95 million donation to Coastal Carolina University in 2020 that was terminated by school officials only weeks after it was publicly announced.

FAMU foundation members raised these points during Thursday’s emergency meeting while venting frustrations about how school staff transacted a nine-figure donation without telling them or the board of trustees. Some board members claimed to have learned about the donation from the university’s press release or from friends after graduation. The board of trustees had already called a special meeting for next week to discuss the donation before Thursday’s shock announcement.

“How did we get this far without knowledge of the transaction or the donor?” asked Chekesha Kidd a foundation member who is co-founder and CEO of Kinumi a concierge service.

School leaders — including Robinson and Shawnta Friday-Stroud FAMU’s vice president for university advancement — said they were barred from discussing the gift publicly due to a non-disclosure agreement. They defended accepting the donation from Batterson Farms Corporation noting the potential upside should the company go public. Batterson Farms did not respond to a request for comment about the potential future value of its stock.

Still the shares could be worth “$500 million or it could be zero” Laurence A. Humphries a member of the foundation’s board noted at the meeting.

“Yes there is clearly risk and we are seeing that in everything that has shaken out” Friday-Stroud said during the meeting. “But at the time that was the decision.”

FAMU did not reach out to Coastal Carolina University as they vetted Gerami’s gift officials confirmed Thursday.

That failed donation was one of several red flags that should have been raised during the vetting of FAMU’s gift according to finance experts.

The gift would have been paid out over the next decade according to an agreement obtained through a records request Thursday by the Tallahassee Democrat. The agreement shows that Gerami “donated 14 million shares of stock of intrinsic value worth at least $239000000 and will donate an additional $61000000 over 10 years” — valuations that don’t match what the school announced only days ago.

The agreement though does not specifically name a company and it’s unclear where and how the stocks were valued.

“Where does this valuation come from?” Rebel Cole a professor of finance at Florida Atlantic University said in an interview. “It raises more questions than it answers. If I were a dog my hackles would be up.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvYm94LW9mZmljZS1raW5nZG9tLW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtb2YtdGhlLWFwZXMtMTIzNTkxMTExOC_SAVlodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1L2JveC1vZmZpY2Uta2luZ2RvbS1vZi10aGUtcGxhbmV0LW9mLXRoZS1hcGVzLTEyMzU5MTExMTgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes’ Solid Previews Around $6M – Thursday Night Box Office,"EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios‘ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

As the name implies everything is (usually) included in the resort rate — from your room to your meals and your experiences which typically involve lounging by a pool or sunning on a beach. Much like cruises all-inclusive resorts are a way to neatly package up your vacation from start to finish with few surprise charges at checkout. One of the only differences is obviously you stay in one spot.

All-inclusives have endured some stigma over the years as being uninspiring inauthentic or in some cases hedonistic party spots. But after more than a year of pandemic ups and downs and with the majority of cruises still on hold pressing the easy button looks more attractive than ever.

""All-inclusives are the next hidden gem"" said Brian King president of Marriott International's Caribbean and Latin American region.

Earlier this year Marriott entered a partnership with Sunwing Travel Group's existing Blue Diamond Resorts to add 19 all-inclusive resorts under the Autograph Collection portfolio. King said Marriott will also offer more well-known Marriott brands in the all-inclusive space with Ritz-Carlton and Luxury Collection properties aimed at luxury travelers and families and W Hotels for adults-only retreats.

""Our customers are super excited about this"" King said citing feedback from Marriott Bonvoy members who wanted more all-inclusive options particularly for family vacations. ""The bottom line is all-inclusive eliminates planning and gives you more time for experiences.""

Increasing demand for all-inclusive stays

Before the pandemic all-inclusive resorts around the world had a steady occupancy rate of about 70% according to STR a firm that compiles market data and analytics for the global hospitality industry. In 2020 those numbers dropped to an average of about 35% as the entire travel industry screeched to a halt.

But Carter Wilson an analyst at STR said demand for all-inclusives will rebound as travel resumes particularly since many all-inclusive resorts are clustered in the Caribbean and Latin America a near-enough jaunt for many U.S. travelers to make comfortably.

""The next couple of years all-inclusive resort destinations are primed to be the benefactor of the demand for leisure travel"" he said. ""If you haven't gone out of the country or if you were still scared to travel the easiest thing to do is go to an all-inclusive. That's like dipping your toes in the water.""

Erica Doyne senior vice president of marketing and communications at AMResorts (which partnered with Choice Hotels in 2019 and counts the all-inclusive Dreams Secrets and Zoëtry brands in its portfolio) said an all-inclusive resort's ability to control the entire experience from a health and safety standpoint will also appeal to cautious travelers.

Plus Doyne said all-inclusive properties are spread out by nature and therefore make social distancing easy to maintain.

""We have the advantage of expansive beaches and the wealth of space in [the] open air and our all-inclusive safety protocol is controlling all that"" she said compared to a traditional hotel or resort where you have to head off the property for dining and experiences and therefore leave the resort's protective bubble.

Next-level luxury

The ongoing evolution of luxury in the all-inclusive space will also be a welcome option for travelers who have shied away from all-inclusives out of concern they aren't luxe or bespoke enough.

Velas Resorts a brand of luxury all-inclusives in Mexico is setting itself apart from competitors with its all-suite residential-like options at its Grand Velas properties. At the Grand Velas Los Cabos suites start at 1100 square feet and come with private terraces. The property also boasts five gourmet restaurants three pools a kids club a teen lounge and a 35000-square-foot spa (although treatments are not included in the room rate).

""We have more options and more design elements"" said Juan Vela vice president of Velas Resorts. ""It feels like home. And you never feel crowded.""

And similar to the exclusive club level at hotels or the ship within a ship on cruise lines some all-inclusives also offer a resort-within-a-resort experience such as the Zoëtry Impression Club. This gives travelers a way to make their stay feel even more private while still being able to access main resort amenities.

Even resorts that aren't technically all-inclusive properties are giving guests the option to add an all-inclusive package to their stay. This tends to be done in popular tourist areas including Los Cabos and parts of Hawaii where there's already a well-established all-inclusive culture. It's also a popular option for wellness retreats or more isolated properties such as the Lodge at Blue Sky in Utah.

In 2016 for example Andaz Costa Rica Resort at Peninsula Papagayo first launched its all-inclusive package for guests. Now according to Hyatt it's more popular than ever. The 2021 package is being booked three times more than it was in 2019.

The reason? Guests are now staying at the resort more and venturing out less making all-inclusive packages more appealing. Even though you can book it in advance guests can also decide to add it on to their stay when they check in.

New to all-inclusive travelers

So who's more likely to give all-inclusive resorts a try this year?

Doyne of AMResorts said it's a natural transition for cruisers to make.

""They have everything they need they know what they are paying for upfront and [they] have the entire experience in one spot"" she said. But she suggested that all-inclusive resorts have more advantages than a cruise.

For instance some luxury all-inclusives offer 24-hour room service which isn't always an option for cruises — or it could come at an extra cost. At resorts guests can dine wherever and whenever they want whereas some cruise ships still enforce set seatings in the main dining room. Liquor and other high-end amenities and services are already often baked into an all-inclusive rate compared to a cruise where you usually have to spring for a premium package.

Depending on your travel style an all-inclusive stay could seem like a better value.

But it's not just cruisers who may find an all-inclusive stay appealing.

Hyatt's Ziva and Zilara all-inclusive brands have attracted a growing number of first-time guests who would not have considered an all-inclusive resort in the past said Gregory Maliassas chief operating officer of Playa Hotels and Resorts a division of Hyatt. And Hyatt will continue to lean on its brand reputation to attract more first-timers.

""Most all of us desire a stress-free no surprises vacation but subpar levels of quality and service from resorts with little to no awareness quickly discredit all-inclusive as a viable option for many consumers"" he said. ""That is our target that is our market: consumers looking for an all-inclusive experience that only Hyatt can deliver.""

And Marriott's Brian King said more people are considering all-inclusive resorts compared to five and even 10 years ago. And now Marriott plans on convincing more of those travelers to actually book an all-inclusive resort.

""The Marriott brand name will lift the experience and the perception"" he said echoing Maliassas. ""If Marriott is doing this you know it's good.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLXRyYW5zYXRsYW50aWMtYnVzaW5lc3MtY2xhc3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Perfect American Airlines Business Class Flight,"For our trip to Greece my mom her partner and I crossed the Atlantic on American Airlines flying from Charlotte to London. Our overall itinerary was Tampa to Charlotte to London to Athens and I booked that for 57500 American AAdvantage miles and under $30 in taxes and fees per person.

I won’t write a detailed review of the transatlantic flight since I recently reviewed American’s 777-200 business class to Hawaii so a lot of the details are similar.

Our plane from Charlotte to London

Rather I just wanted to give American credit for what I’d consider to be a legitimately solid transatlantic business class experience at least in these times. The way I view it American nailed all the basics here — a great seat solid amenities good food and friendly service. That last category can often be the toughest to get right so kudos to the crew for that.

The last time I took a transatlantic flight out of Charlotte was on US Airways in 2013 and I remember the purser on that flight to this day — Miss Peggy. She was something…

Anyway let me share the highlights of this flight below.

Reverse herringbone seats are great

We were flying an American Airlines 777-200 with Collins Aerospace reverse herringbone seats. These are comfortable seats so it doesn’t get much better than that for a 7hr55min flight. For anyone curious what transatlantic loads are like nowadays 22 of the 37 business class seats were occupied on this flight.

Solid amenities especially bedding

While not as good as United Polaris long haul bedding American’s Casper bedding is excellent with a large pillow and cozy blanket.

The Bang & Olufsen headphones are also decent for anyone who likes to use airplane inflight entertainment (which I rarely do other than to keep an eye on the map).



American Airlines business class headphones from Bang & Olufsen

My flight also had American’s brand new amenity kits from Shinola which seemed mighty unremarkable to me.

Surprisingly good food

Here was the menu for our flight:

And then here was the drink list:

Service began shortly after takeoff with drinks and packaged mixed nuts. I don’t usually drink when flying with US airlines but when I saw Lanson champagne on the menu I figured I’d order a glass. I mainly just ordered it on principle — I feel like if there’s a drinkable wine option on American then you might as well seize the moment since it’s anyone’s guess when that will happen again. 😉

American continues to use plastic cups though at least the pours were generous.

American Airlines business class drinks & nuts

Dinner was served soon after takeoff and the entire dinner service was on one tray. I appreciate that American lets you pre-order your meals so you can be guaranteed that you’ll get your first choice.

Everything was served wrapped as is standard nowadays. I think I’m a fan of the one tray service on a short transatlantic flight and I almost hope it sticks around as it really expedites service.



American Airlines business class dinner

I’ve gotta say the food was very good.



American Airlines business class dinner

The starter consisted of shaved beef with lemon aioli edamame guacamole and pico de gallo. There was a packaged bread roll to go along with it which was warm and surprisingly soft.



American Airlines business class dinner appetizer

I decided to be ballsy with my main course order and selected the crab cakes with lemon chive cream sauce broccoli chipotle slaw and blistered tomatoes. While I feel like crab cakes could go very wrong on a plane they were legitimately decent — I’d be happy if I were served these at a mediocre restaurant (that’s meant to be a compliment just to be clear).



American Airlines business class dinner main course

For dessert there was a salted caramel tartlet which was also good.



American Airlines business class dinner dessert

About 75 minutes before landing breakfast was served with the choice of a continental breakfast or an omelet. I selected the continental breakfast which had a nicely varied fruit plate granola and yogurt. I skipped the croissant which was hard.

Friendly & professional service

Ultimately a crew can make or break a flight and this crew couldn’t have been lovelier. The ladies working business class were professional friendly informal playful and really seemed to enjoy their jobs and that’s always so nice to see.

Often it’s the smallest things that make a difference. For example on my United flight from Maui to Chicago a couple of weeks ago the flight attendant took meal orders as follows without any sort of greeting:

“For dinner tonight do you want grilled chicken breast rice and vegetables or cheese ravioli?”

On this flight the purser Lisa took meal orders as follows:

“Mr. Schlappig it’s nice to have you flying with us this evening. Have you had a chance to look over the menu? I see that you’ve pre-ordered the crab cakes is that still what you’d like to have?”

Airlines in the USA will never be able to compete with Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways when it comes to consistent and professional service. However what they can do is strike a great balance between being genuine fun and professional and this crew did exactly that. Kudos.

The crew took great care of my mom!

Bottom line

On a good day American Airlines can be really competitive across the Atlantic. You always get excellent flat bed seats with direct aisle access along with solid bedding. The rest of the experience is consistently inconsistent.

Fortunately on this flight we lucked out with great food excellent champagne and an absolutely lovely crew. If only American were always this good.

Oh shoot I totally forgot to mention the one thing (completely outside of the crew’s control) that ended this flight on a sour note. I’ll save that for the next post.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3dGVsZWdyYXBobmcuY29tL2xhZ29zLW1hcnJpb3R0LWhvdGVsLWlrZWphLWEtbmV3LXZlbmRvci1vZi1sdXh1cnktb3BlbnMtdG8tcHVibGljLWFwcGxhdWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LAGOS MARRIOTT HOTEL IKEJA: A new vendor of luxury opens to public applaud,"Marriott Hotels the signature of Marriott Bonvoy’s portfolio of 30 extra ordinary brands last week made a grand entry to the Nigerian hospitality market with the formal opening of Lagos Marriott Hotel Ikeja.

We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us?

After spending the better part of a year in lockdown most Americans are finally eager to get moving again. According to travel expert Brian Kelly demand for flights is now approaching pre-pandemic heights: On May 23 for instance the TSA screened 1.8 million travelers which is down only 207019 passengers from the same day in 2019.

As the founder and CEO of The Points Guy it's Kelly's job to track the latest trends in the travel industry and help his 10 million monthly readers cash in their credit card points to score the best deals on flights hotels and more.

To that end if you're considering a summer vacation and haven't booked yet it's likely time to change that: ""You’re not going to see the cheap airline fares you saw during the peak of the pandemic so be sure to book your travel in advance and check alternative dates and airports"" he advises. ""If you're going to travel internationally be sure to research the rules and restrictions of your destination related to COVID-19.""

Kelly for his part hopes he'll be off to Portugal this summer. ""It’s been two years since I’ve traveled with my parents because of COVID-19. We are hopeful August will be the right time to make this trip happen"" he says.

No matter where you may be headed it's important to arrive armed with the best and most up-to-date advice. We asked Kelly 20 questions about how to plan that long long overdue escape of your own.

First let's talk planning: Where are you seeing some of the best vacation deals right now?

We're mostly seeing deals for Europe right now given that the EU is starting to reopen to Americans. For example you can fly to Rome this summer from Newark or JFK for only $706 round trip on United. If you’re looking to use points or miles you can fly from JFK to Paris round trip in July and August for only 60000 AAdvantage miles plus $97.

Air Portugal also has a great deal right now from Chicago to Lisbon via Montreal for only $337. Outside of the EU you can fly to Alaska this summer for only 5000 Delta SkyMiles round trip (fantastic deal!) and you can fly to Hawaii via Southwest from several mainland cities for under $300 roundtrip.

What’s one of the biggest mistakes most people make when booking a summer vacation?

During COVID-19 don’t make the mistake of not reviewing the restrictions and requirements of your destination such as a required negative COVID-19 test or purchase of a health visa. Pre-pandemic there are lots of mistakes that can be made when booking a summer vacation including not checking alternate dates or airports for a better deal forgetting to alert your bank when traveling internationally planning for a different currency and not using travel apps.

What’s the best bang-for-your buck points-exchange deal you’ve seen lately?

Amex has a 40 percent bonus for Hilton and Marriott through June 15th. I’ve been using that to book expensive Marriott hotels in hot markets right now like Miami Florida.

What’s the best must-have new piece of travel gear you’ve seen in the past month?

It’s critical to keep your vaccine card in a safe place so if you haven’t invested in a nice zip travel wallet now is the time! I currently use this Gucci wallet and it is great to also keep your passport safe but remember do NOT travel with it in your pocket.

If someone can afford to splurge on just one travel item what should it be?

Rimowa Topas Titanium Carry on Luggage IATA 21 Rimowa Topas Titanium Carry on Luggage IATA 21 $1800 at Amazon Credit: Rimowa/Amazon

Luggage! As my dad always says “cheap is expensive” so I think it is worth spending more money on a nice piece of luggage that will last forever. I love Rimowa’s luggage because they’re especially awesome for tall people since the handle extends extra high. My favorite product right now is the Rimowa Cabin Plus .

Just as a hypothetical let's fast forward a few months and say COVID is completely under control. Where’s the best party going to be?

The best summer parties this year are going to be in Mykonos Greece. Greece has already cleared the way for foreigners to come visit and room rates at top hotels are already through the roof.

What's the most underreported aspect of how the pandemic has affected—and continues to affect—the travel industry?

The most underreported aspect of how COVID-19 has affected travel is how travel itself has changed and how business has moved more to a business-leisure travel model where people work and travel at the same time for longer periods of time.

While the new face of business travel has yet to be seen it will be vastly different than the typical Monday-Thursday model it used to be.

Where do you like to get travel advice and recommendations besides your own website?

In addition to The Points Guy I like to reference Scott’s Cheap Flights and secretflying.com .

What are a few of your favorite Instagram accounts to follow for travel inspiration?

I love to follow @marlondutoit (An African safari guide and photographer) @cedtripping and @hotelwhisperer .

Setting international travel aside for a moment what’s your favorite small town to visit in the US?

My hometown—New Hope Pennsylvania. I love the restaurants and food scene how you are always surrounded by nature and tubing down the Delaware River. It's a hidden gem just a short drive away from New York City that I always recommend to friends and readers.

Where are the best beaches to visit right now if you're looking for more of a chill vibe and not a huge party scene?

If you’re dreaming of a Florida beach vacation but want to avoid the crowds consider the Gulf Coast beaches of Texas Alabama or Louisiana instead.

If you had to stay at one all-inclusive resort for a week this summer which one would you pick and why?

Nihi in Indonesia . It's one of the best most authentic resort experiences I’ve ever had.

What’s the one piece of travel advice you find yourself repeating to people most frequently?

Be flexible. Especially now as the demand to travel rises you will need to be more willing to alter your travel plans for the best deals. Consider traveling during the work week or flying out of an alternative airport.

You will also need to be flexible and prepared for your destinations’ requirements and restrictions related to COVID-19 so be sure to do your research and prepare accordingly for COVID-19 tests quarantines proof of vaccine etc.

Let’s assume most people know about TSA Pre-Check and Clear. What else should people sign up for to make life easier when traveling?

Global Entry . It can save you a ton of time going through customs upon arriving at your destination.

What's one of the best healthy on-the-go snacks that you can find at most airports if you don't have time to sit down?

I run on Starbucks cold brew and their sous vide egg bites—they're dynamite. My only request is that Airport Starbucks add mobile ordering because the lines are usually twice as long as the TSA lines!

What’s the most overlooked way of easily boosting your credit card and travel points?

Hit the minimum spend when you initially get your credit card to earn the sign up bonus. For example you can earn 80000 bonus points when you spend $4000 within the first 3 months of opening your account for a Chase Sapphire Preferred card.

What’s your favorite packing hack for maximizing space in your luggage?

If I need more room in my suitcase I will pack clothes inside my shoes since they are so big. It’s a great way to maximize all of the space inside the suitcase.

Where’s the first place you personally want to visit once it’s 100 percent safe?

Machu Picchu. It’s currently open but Peru is still under curfew orders and on the verge of lockdown so I want to go when the situation is more stable.

What’s the best way you’ve found to beat or combat jet lag once you’ve arrived?

Take a hot shower. When you are on the go for really long stretches of time it’s nice to clean up and feel human again. Also adjust the time zone on your devices in advance hydrate yourself and fight the nap and get fresh air upon arriving at your destination.

Do you have any tricks or secrets for people who struggle to sleep on planes?

Wear comfortable clothes and choose your seat carefully and if you can upgrade to a lie-flat seat or at least one with more space than basic economy.

What’s an airport perk/feature that not enough people take advantage of?

The lounges. Lounges are a great way to get some work done before a flight clean up even take a shower in some cases and grab a quick bite to eat or a cocktail.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByb3BlcnR5Z3VydS5jb20ubXkvcHJvcGVydHktbmV3cy8yMDIxLzUvMTk4ODAxL2lvaS1wcm9wZXJ0aWVzLWdyb3Vwcy1uZXQtcHJvZml0LW1vcmUtdGhhbi1kb3VibGVkLWluLTNxLWZ5MjAyMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IOI Properties Group's Net Profit More Than Doubled In 3Q FY2021,"IOI Properties Group Berhad (IOIPG) recorded a strong financial performance for its third quarter ended 31 March 2021 (Q3 FY2021) with a net profit of RM178.9 million which more than doubled from RM83.6 million in the preceding year corresponding quarter.

Its revenue and operating profit also showed significant improvement mainly attributed to higher contribution from the property development segment. IOIPG’s operating profit soared 72% to RM208.1 million with revenue expanding 44% to RM579.0 million in Q3 FY2021 compared with the preceding year corresponding quarter.

“Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the Group achieved exceptional performance in Q3 FY2021. The overall business sentiment was subdued with the Movement Control Order (MCO) 2.0 imposed in mid-January 2021. However every member of Team IOI pushed forward and focused on achieving targets and we defied the odds. All these are possible through the commitment and passion of Team IOI to consistently deliver products and services that exceed expectations” said IOIPG Chief Executive Officer Dato’ Voon Tin Yow.

For the property development segment in Malaysia IOIPG’s effective and unique sales and marketing campaign which was designed to assist buyers to overcome the challenges of homeownership and realise life-long dreams received favourable response. This has led to strong sales performance in Q3 FY2021 with profits to be registered in coming quarters.

He added that IOIPG would carry on with its dynamic marketing initiative while leveraging on the Home Ownership Campaign to boost sales of well sought-after mid-priced range products. These high-quality products are built within integrated developments offering various amenities in flourishing areas such as the Klang Valley (16 Sierra Bandar Puteri Bangi IOI Resort City Warisan Puteri Sepang Bandar Puteri Puchong and Bandar Puchong Jaya) and Johor (Taman Kempas Utama and Bandar Putra Kulai) that are easily accessible and well-connected.

Contributions from the property development segment were RM485.2 million in revenue and RM182.3 million in operating profit in Q3 FY2021 which soared by 71% and 113% respectively from the preceding year corresponding quarter. The sterling performance was mostly due to higher sales contribution from operations in Malaysia and China as well as advance progress work from on-going residential development in China.

The residential developments in IOI Palm City Xiamen China will continue to contribute to the Group’s financial performance in the coming quarters. Meanwhile IOI Palm City Mall Xiamen has secured high occupancy level with business expected to commence by the third quarter of 2021.

The pace of construction progress of Central Boulevard Towers in Singapore has gained speed. However looking ahead the Group expects further uncertainties due to the measures taken by the government of Singapore to contain the recent wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Leasing activities have commenced and IOIPG has seen a strong response from the market.

For the property investment segment it contributed RM72.4 million in revenue and RM32.9 million in operating profit in Q3 FY2021 which were RM8.5 million and RM7.2 million lower respectively against the preceding year corresponding quarter. Meanwhile the hospitality and leisure segment recorded a decrease in revenue from RM35.4 million to RM19.1 million and operating loss increased from RM5.0 million to RM7.5 million in Q3 FY2021.

The recovery of the property investment and hospitality and leisure segments in Malaysia were dampened when MCO 2.0 was imposed; and it is expected to be further impacted by the ongoing MCO 3.0 which commenced on 12 May 2021. Nonetheless the property investment segment will continue to implement strategies in tenant retention. As at 31 March 2021 the Group has supported its tenants with rental relief worth over RM55 million. To maintain its market share in retail IOIPG will also leverage on its customer loyalty programme and adopt digital innovation to enhance customer experience.

Although the business environment remained challenging due to the pandemic IOIPG’s performance in the current year-to-date improved significantly. The Group’s revenue and operating profit rose by about one-fifth to RM1.8 billion and RM719.3 million respectively in the current year-to-date of FY2021 compared with the preceding year corresponding period. The increase in revenue was mainly due to higher contribution from operations in the Klang Valley and Xiamen China.

With the prolonged pandemic and persistent geopolitical tensions the operating environment is expected to remain challenging and uncertain. However the Group will always manage its operations prudently and professionally to ensure satisfactory performance in the coming quarters and at the same time consolidate its market position and strengthen its competitive edge to capture any opportunities that may arise when the situation gradually improves.

I watch for juicy credit card welcome bonuses and time my new credit applications around big annual purchases like our home or auto insurance so I can easily meet any minimum spend requirements.

I focus on a few travel rewards programs that I know I’ll use regularly such as Aeroplan WestJet Dollars Marriott Bonvoy and American Express Membership Rewards. I find these programs give me the best bang for my buck when I redeem points for travel.

But my spending has changed significantly over the past 15 months.

First I cancelled my long-time everyday spending card – the Capital One Aspire Travel World MasterCard – shortly after the company devalued the earn rate from 2% to 1.5% and stopped offering 10000 annual bonus miles.

Second with our 2020 trips cancelled and the bulk of our spending now coming from groceries and take-out I switched to using the Scotia Momentum Visa Infinite Card to maximize cash back on our food spending.

Third the PC Financial World EliteMasterCard added a new minimum spend requirement of $15000 to maintain eligibility. We didn’t meet this criteria so I cancelled the card. That was my go-to card for No Frills and Shoppers Drug Mart spending.

Finally we stopped going to Costco regularly to avoid the long lines and lax enforcement of public health measures. That meant no longer needing to carry a MasterCard at all (or a Costco card for that matter). I felt my wallet getting lighter.

With all of these changes I thought it would be fun to give readers a glimpse inside my wallet to see which cards I’m carrying now and how I still plan to maximize my rewards going forward.

Here’s a look inside my wallet:

Debit cards

I carry one debit card and that’s for our joint chequing account at TD Bank. I also have a business chequing account at TD and a no-fee chequing account at Tangerine but don’t carry the debit cards since all of those transactions are done online.

Years ago I threatened to close my TD chequing account and move to Tangerine to save on bank fees. The customer service rep made me an offer I couldn’t refuse by converting my chequing account to a student account which had no monthly fees at all and came with 25 transactions per month.

I haven’t paid bank fees for five years but I just received a letter from TD describing a bunch of fee increases (effective June 1) and that it will be auditing student accounts to make sure the account holder is in fact a student. I suspect my days of free banking at TD are over.

Credit cards

I have four credit cards in my wallet including the Scotia Momentum Visa Infinite card the American Express Cobalt Card the HSBC World Elite MasterCard and the American Express Business Platinum Card.

It goes without saying that I use a rewards credit card for all my purchases – and pay them off in full every month – but since I can’t find one credit card that works best for every single purchase I have to use a combination of cards in order to maximize my rewards.

I use the Scotia card for groceries and recurring bill payments like cable and internet. That’s because it pays 4% back on groceries and recurring bills. I get cash back once per year in November.

I use the Amex Cobalt card for groceries as well plus liquor store spending. This card pays 5x points on ‘eats and drinks’ plus a 2500 Membership Rewards bonus for every month you spend $500 (for the first 12 months only). I transfer these Membership Rewards points to Marriott Bonvoy at a transfer rate of 5:6.

I use the HSBC World Elite MasterCard for all other spending. I applied for this card in late 2020 to take advantage of an incredible 100000 point welcome bonus. I like the card and will consider keeping it as an everyday MasterCard if nothing better comes along. Points can be redeemed against any travel purchase plus you get a $100 travel enhancement credit.

Finally I use the American Express Business Platinum for all of our business expenses. This card currently has an unbelievable 100000 Membership Rewards bonus if you can spend $10000 in three months. I typically convert these Membership Rewards points to Aeroplan.

Those are the cards in my wallet but I do have several other credit cards lying around the house. These include the Amex Platinum Card the WestJet RBC World Elite MasterCard the TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite card and the CIBC Aeroplan Visa Infinite Card.

With the exception of the Amex Platinum Card which I’m holding as a luxury card that gets us hotel benefits and airport lounge access these cards are highly “churnable” and come with excellent welcome bonuses. The Aeroplan cards in particular are worth a look as the cards come with no annual fee for the first year a 20000 point welcome bonus plus a Buddy Pass.

Loyalty cards

I don’t carry any loyalty cards in my physical wallet but my Apple Wallet contains the following loyalty cards:

Aeroplan

Air Miles

PC Optimum

Priority Pass

Marriott Bonvoy

Scene

Thankfully I can access these cards on my phone so I don’t end up with a George Costanza sized wallet.

Cash

I don’t use cash very much to begin with and during the pandemic most businesses encouraged customers to pay with debit or credit anyway.

That’s why I literally have the exact same $20 $10 and two $5 dollar bills in my wallet today that I had in March 2020.

Miscellaneous

Of course I also have my driver’s license a NEXUS card my Alberta Health card and a couple of business cards in my wallet. I also have a library card.

Finally there’s a loyalty card from my barber shop that I haven’t used in 15 months. Special thanks to my wife for keeping my hair trim over the past year.

Final thoughts

My wallet is starting to fill up again after more than a year of using just one or two cash back cards.

It’s a bit of a pain to constantly switch up rewards credit cards and find new loyalty programs. But travel and cash back rewards can be highly lucrative if you put in some research and find the cards and programs that work for you.

It’s okay to start dreaming about travel again as we near the end of the pandemic and restrictions start to ease. Use up those travel credits that you received when trips were cancelled last year. Start collecting travel points so you can supplement your travel budget during your next trip (revenge travel anyone?).

Readers what’s in your wallet? Do you have the same $20 bill from last March?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZmFybWVyc3Jldmlld2FmcmljYS5jb20vMzAwMDAwLXVnYW5kYW4teW91dGgtdG8tYmUtc3VwcG9ydGVkLWluLWFncmljdWx0dXJlLXNlY3Rvci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,300000 Ugandan youth to be supported in agriculture sector,"300000 Young Ugandans are set to be supported in agriculture sector. This follows a launched programme by Humanitarian aid and development agency GOAL Uganda which will enable rural youth access dignified and fulfilling work in the agricultural sector over the next five years.

The program is in partnership with MasterCard Foundation’s Young Africa Works in Uganda – Markets for Youths Programme which target 210000 young women and 90000 young men between the ages of 16 and 35 years and will also include 30000 refugees and 15000 young people living with disabilities.

The programme is going to be implemented in 18 districts across Uganda in five sub-regions of Central Acholi Lango Karamoja and South West. These youth set to be propped up by MasterCard Foundation will be supported in accessing financial services and products skills training in practice and management of farm enterprises accessing and participating in activities in the agricultural market system and collaborating to increase purchasing and influencing power in the agricultural market system.

Influencing power in the agricultural market system.

In addition the programme will reach 600000 people indirectly by partnering with the private sector to expand and adopt their business models to develop new products and services for young farmers.

The Country Director of GOAL in Uganda Jennifer Williams said the reason they are investing in agriculture is because it is one of the biggest actors in Uganda that will provide a vast opportunity for young people to engage in farming and given the fact that the rate of unemployment among the youths is high they saw it fit to support them so that they can be included in the country’s agricultural system.

“We are going to do this through four strategies; access to finance skills on and off-farm inputs and also target bringing in the private sector and vocational training institutes. We are also going to empower the youths and provide them with a voice through which they can engage the agricultural market and get a response” said Williams.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZsaWdodGNsdWIuaXQvZW4vMjAyMS8wNS9hMjIwLW5ldy1haXJidXMtY2FiaW4v0gFCaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZmxpZ2h0Y2x1Yi5pdC9lbi8yMDIxLzA1L2EyMjAtbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1jYWJpbi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,L’A220 si conferma l’aereo del momento ecco la nuova cabina pensata da Airbus,"Rely on the Exclusive team for your luxury hotel reservations.

At TFC we are fans of the Airbus A220. since the first time we flew on this model of aircraft to Riga. When it was still called the Bombardier C-series we understood that it was an aircraft destined to revolutionize the short-haul market.

In this article:

This week the Airspace Customer Showroom (ACS) located in Toulouse France unveiled the latest full-size A220 model showcasing the Airbus cabin experience inside this exclusive customer showroom. ""Today is an important date for the development of the A220 a member of the Airbus family. We look forward to showing the mockup to our customers who are already extremely excited to visit"" said Christine de Gagné the airline's director of marketing.

The ACS is the equivalent of a car showroom where customers interested in buying a plane can visit full-size prototypes and choose fittings just as at a dealership you customize your own car.

Seven years after its first flight the first test vehicle the ""FTV1″ was repurposed by Airbus teams to become part of the showroom.

""The interior layout of the A220 has been an exciting challenge for the Airbus teams"" explain the Franco-German company. ""The cabin interior has to be able to adapt and be versatile. We have to think about configuration features such as lighting and atmosphere allowing customers to experience different stimulating scenarios for passengers.""

It must be admitted that Airbus engineers managed to do a really good job designing a premium cabin with business seats comparable in size to those found on wide-body aircraft.

Now all that remains to be done is to wait and see if among the many customers who have chosen to focus on this model some will decide to equip their fleet with a two-cabin layout instead of the usual 2 seats on one side and 3 on the other with no distinction between business and economy.

To understand how popular this model is just look at the order list: to date there are 649 in the two configurations 100 and 200.

It is currently Latvian airline Air Baltic to have the largest A220/200 fleet with 26 active vehicles and 24 more to be delivered in the coming years. The American Delta instead has 41 which is the smallest variant. Deliveries to Air France (60) Breeze (60) and Jet Blue which will become the largest A220 fleet due to the arrival of 70 examples.",,,,,,

Today they battled for the Group 6 berth in the Round of 16 at the Bank of Hope LPGA Match Play Hosted by Shadow Creek.

Shin needed to win her match against Lee to force a sudden-death playoff and she did just that taking down the UCLA alumna by a 4-and-2 margin. That included winning five of the last seven holes securing birdies at Nos. 10 14 and 16 along the way to close it out.

“She is one of my closest friends out here and she lives walking distance away from me” said Shin. “It was a little difficult but I just tried to play my game and not smack talk too much. It was a pretty tight match until the very end. She kind of gave it away a few holes and then I was able to hold my position.

“We tried to talk about daily things we always talk about. We text every night so we just continued the conversation from last night. It is match play after all. I didn’t want to affect anything [in our friendship] going forward.”

The duo waited on the result of Hyo Joo Kim versus Megan Khang before hopping on the shuttle back to No. 1. A win by Khang and she would have made it a three-way playoff.

Instead Shin and Lee resumed their duel after Khang bogeyed 18 to drop a 1-up decision to Hyo Joo Kim. It took four extra holes but the 2016 Volunteers of America Classic champion earned the victory.

“I saw Alison grab driver on the [par-5 4th] tee box and knowing how she hits it a little further than I do I didn’t think it was a driver hole for her” Shin said. “She hit a pretty good drive but it went straight into a tree and she was down in the mulch. Tried to get it out but she was hitting through the tree. It was a very difficult position.

“I didn’t hit my drive the best but kept it short of the tree. Put myself in position for a decent third shot where I could get to the green. She unfortunately couldn’t do that and I finished out with a birdie.”

Shin will meet Eun-Hee Ji at 7:40 a.m. PT on Saturday for a spot in the quarterfinals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZkaWdlc3QuY29tL3N0b3J5L2Jhbmstb2YtaG9wZS1scGdhLW1hdGNoLXBsYXktYXQtc2hhZG93LWNyZWVrLWdyb3VwLWJyZWFrZG93bnPSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2xmZGlnZXN0LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9iYW5rLW9mLWhvcGUtbHBnYS1tYXRjaC1wbGF5LWF0LXNoYWRvdy1jcmVlay1ncm91cC1icmVha2Rvd25zL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Breaking down the results of group play at the Bank of Hope LPGA Match-Play,Here is who emerged as the winner from each of the groups.

Her bio on the team’s web page says she loves animals and chose Mission “to play tennis and get on the dean’s list.” She’s also 71 years old and a heck of a doubles player.

While Westergren is the most senior player on Mission’s tennis team of 13 players the others are in their 40s 50s and 60s with the youngest in her late 20s. The COVID-19 pandemic played a role in bringing together the seasoned team as Coach Scott Howard was unable to visit high school campuses to recruit players last year. Many colleges scratched their seasons altogether because of the challenge but Howard saw an opportunity to reach out to the South Bay’s tennis community and recruit a full team.

But despite their experience level the team members are legit students Assistant Coach Kathleen Watson said. “While the age range of our team might be considered non-traditional the players still have to take a full academic load of units maintain good academic standing and meet all the other eligibility requirements” she said. Like other students they talk about their classes during practice and finish up homework on the team bus. “Many of them have earned straight As in their academic courses” Watson said.

They’ve got pretty incredible lives outside of school too. The team members include Reine Johansen an aerospace systems engineer at NASA Ames; Amy Robinson a former Cisco executive who now runs an international nonprofit; Sherry Keogh a yoga instructor and fitness trainer; Lara Norman-Stowers a former video game artist; and Westergren who is originally from the United Kingdom and serves as an assistant tennis coach at Presentation High School in San Jose.

Having three or four decades on their opponents wasn’t daunting for the team especially after their first win. They have decades of experience playing and teaching tennis — using strategy to outsmart younger stronger teams. Of course they also had to deal with regular college sports challenges like team buses running late and others unique to the COVID era such as not being able to cross-train in the gym or have in-person team meetings and sometimes play with masks on.

None of it kept them down. The team finished with a 4-3 record after a big 7-2 win on the road against Cañada College in Redwood City on Thursday night putting them in second place in the Coast Conference.

“Seeing these players compete is a roller coaster of emotions” Watson said. “I’m proud to see these special women help an on-again off-again program stay alive so that the next generation of incoming student-athletes will have a chance to pursue their dreams and play on a college team.”

INNOVATIVE OUTREACH: There’s a general belief that young people are less inclined to get the coronavirus vaccine — and this is nothing new as youth usually exudes a sense of invulnerability — and a parallel belief that they’re also more likely to listen to their peers than anyone who say writes a column in this antique thing called a newspaper. So the city of San Jose has partnered with the Knight Foundation and marketing agency XOMAD on a program to have online influencers spread the word about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.

San Jose is working to hit Santa Clara County’s vaccination goal of 85 percent of residents by Aug. 1 and this approach may be a big help in that effort especially with Vietnamese Latino and Black communities. The Knight Foundation has invested $125000 in the effort in which select influencers — those with between 1000 and 100000 followers — will post about vaccine efficacy in their own words on social media platforms using the hashtags #StayHealthySJ and #ThisIsOurShotSJ.

Will this effort have an impact or just be ignored? We’ll find out but — and pardon the pun — it’s worth a shot if it can make any difference. And for those who are still on the fence but able to be influenced by old school media go to sccfreevax.org to find out where you can get a vaccine in Santa Clara County.

PLAY ON: Roberta Guaspari — a violinist teacher and co-founder of Opus 118 Harlem School of Music — will be this year’s recipient of the Children’s Discovery Museum’s Legacy for Children Award which will be presented at the Purple Museum’s virtual fundraising event on June 17.

Children’s Discovery Museum Executive Director Marilee Jennings says Guaspari exemplifies the award by using her talents to help kids gain confidence and feel success. “Roberta has been unstoppable in making music a part of children’s lives in East Harlem” Jennings said. “Her belief in the promise and potential of all children is something the museum has aspired to every day of our 30 years of serving the community.”

This is a key event for the Children’s Discovery Museum which was closed for 393 days resulting in the loss of ticket revenue for 13 months not to mention the extra expense required to modify the facility to safely reopen. And that’s why its board of directors set an aggressive goal to raise $2 million through the event. Titled “Keep on Playing.” The 5:30 p.m. stream will include performances by classical hip-hop duo and fiddle masters Black Violin an artist-led activity to make a musical rain stick and appearances by Mariachi Mexico and the Cantabile Youth Singers of Silicon Valley. You can purchase tickets or register to watch the event for free at www.cdm.org.

MANAGING OUT: San Jose City Manager Dave Sykes’ announcement of his impending retirement this summer makes San Jose the second Silicon Valley city this week with a top spot to fill. Cupertino City Manager Deborah Feng gave her 30-day notice on Wednesday bringing an end to a two-year tenure that was largely eclipsed by the coronavirus pandemic.

Her resignation closed out a roller coaster month for Feng a longtime administrator at NASA Ames Research Center before taking the Cupertino job. Earlier this month she took responsibility for failing to inform the city council about a letter she received from the state Housing and Community Development Dept. before it passed an ordinance to bring a previously approved housing program into its zoning code — something the state agency said it couldn’t do. On Monday two days before she resigned Feng was feted as one of the valley’s 100 Women of Influence by the Silicon Valley Business Journal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZwdW5raHEuY29tL2xwZ2EtdG91ci9hcnRpY2xlcy9icm9udGUtbGF3LW9uLXRoZS1jaGFyZ2UtYXQtbHBnYS1tYXRjaC1wbGF50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bronte Law on the charge at LPGA Match-Play,"Law takes out another American!

After a tie with Amy Olson on Wednesday and a 2&1 win over Austin Ernst on Thursday Law moved into the Round of 16 with a big statement that she’s ready to take on Team USA at Inverness Club.“You still have to execute the shots but obviously feeling that little bit of momentum shift is what you have to grab when you're in match play” said Law who won eight of 13 holes in her match with Park.“I can sense it when it's there. I think that's one of the things that I like the most it's the quality that you kind of need to have in that situation.”Law’s run against her American foes will continue on Saturday when she takes on Las Vegas’ own Danielle Kang. Kang handily beat her close friend Lizette Salas on Friday winning the first hole to immediately grab a 1-up lead and cruising to a bittersweet 4&3 win.“Of course I want to win whoever I'm playing but it's just different. It's a different feeling especially with Lizette” said Kang who has yet to trail in the competition.“Every time she missed a putt any time she missed I'd go ‘Oh go in.’ My heart just kind of dropped because I don't ever want her to miss putts. I'm not wishing that on her or anything.”Kang is the only player who went 3-0-0 in the group-play format and with her hometown knowledge of Shadow Creek she will be a formidable opponent for Law. But Law is a fiery competitor particularly when a head-to- head win is at stake.“She is American so I'm running with that trend at the moment. Obviously Danielle is one of the best players in the world so there is nothing more to say than that” added Law with a wry smile.“I'm still going to go out and play the game that I've been playing. I think when I'm on I'm good enough to beat anyone. And if you can't back yourself then that's all I can say.”Unheralded American Jenny Coleman continued her lucky Vegas roll draining a par putt on the 18th in the day’s final match to tie with Ashleigh Buhai and reach the Round of 16. Coleman built a 3-up lead through six holes but Buhai chipped away at the deficit and tied the match with a birdie at No. 11. Buhai nearly chipped in for birdie from the front of the green at 18 to force a playoff but two pars gave the group victory to Coleman.“We'd been back and forth all day hitting like good shot getting rewarded hitting a good shot not getting rewarded. You name it it could happen” said Coleman who will face Ally Ewing in the Round of 16. “Just being very patient and hoping you get a little luck.”Six matches went to sudden-death playoffs to set Saturday’s match-play bracket. The longest playoff saw Jenny Shin knock out her fellow Las Vegas resident Alison Lee with a par on the fourth playoff hole. Anna Nordqvist made a two-putt par on the first playoff hole to eliminate No. 1 seed Jin Young Ko after beating her by a 5&3 margin earlier in the day.“I played really well this morning. She is a World No. 1 so I knew she was going to be a really tough match” said Nordqvist. “Part of me felt like I didn't have anything to lose because I knew I had to get my point to have a chance at a potential playoff so just very proud of myself.”With a par on the second playoff hole Brittany Altomare reached the Round of 16 over Sei Young Kim who won the 2017 Lorena Ochoa Match-Play and is the Tour’s most recent match-play winner.England's Mel Reid who is looking a shoo-in to return to the European Solheim team in September prevailed over potential teammate Azahara Munoz with a birdie on the first playoff hole.– Anna Nordqvist def.

UEFA Euro 2020 will soon take center-stage as the season of club football has come to a close. The tournament that brings together the best European international teams will take place in June-July. The prestigious and one of the most-competitive international tournaments was rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

There are a lot of strong teams with top-class players vying for the title of European champions. Winning the trophy also ensures qualification to the FIFA Confederations Cup. There will be some interesting games right from the start as the group stages kickoff leading to the Round of 16 matches.

The three matchdays will see teams fighting for the points as they look to secure qualification to the knockout rounds. Here are the top-10 group stage matches one should not miss when UEFA Euro 2020 gets underway:

10. Italy Vs Turkey - 12 June 2021

Italy and Turkey will kick-off Euro 2020 when they play the opening fixture on 12 June 2021. Both teams are favourites to qualify from a tightly-contested Group A. The game is important since the victors will be in a strong position to qualify for the knockout rounds. Turkey have three wins in their last four games while Italy last lost an international game back in September 2018.

9. Netherlands Vs Austria - 18 June 2021

Netherlands and Austria are the strongest teams and the favourites to qualify from Group C of the competition. Moreover the Dutch are one of the tournament favourites and will hope to secure three points against a tough Austria side. Whoever wins this game might secure knockouts qualification as their other games are relatively easier.

8. Denmark Vs Belgium - 17 June 2021

Denmark and Belgium are favourites to qualify from Group B which also involves Russia and Finland. Belgium are the top-ranked team in the world and will take some beating. However Denmark boast stars like Christian Eriksen and Kasper Schmeichel who will challenge the Red Devils for the top spot.

7. Switzerland Vs Turkey - 20 June 2021

Switzerland are placed in Group A alongside Italy Turkey and Wales

Group A will be closely watched by the neutrals since all the teams in the Euro 2020 group are of equal strength. Switzerland and Turkey will clash against each other in the third round of matches which is usually the deciding game. The match will ensure the fate of either side in terms of who qualifies into the knockouts and who bows out.

6. Italy Vs Wales - 20 June 2021

Italy and Wales will play the other game in Group A at the same time on 20 June 2021. While Italy come into the tournament in the backdrop of a terrifying run of good results Wales are a strong team in their own respect. They have players like Gareth Bale and Daniel James who can be unplayable on their day.

5. England Vs Croatia - 13 June 2021

Luka Modric and Co. will look to wipe off their rough patch and repeat the heroics of 2018 World Cup

England and Croatia are favourites for the title. They will clash against each other in their opening match of the tournament. In the likeliest scenario these two teams will qualify into the knockouts but the opening game could decide which team finishes in first position. Securing the top spot in the group usually lands an easier opponent in the Round of 16.

4. Spain Vs Poland - 20 June 2021

Spain and Poland are the strongest contenders to qualify into the knockout rounds from Group E. The other two teams in Slovakia and Sweden will hope the match ends in a draw to help their cause. Regardless the two outfits will go for three points on the second matchday to ensure qualification.

3. France Vs Germany - 16 June 2021

Group F is the ‘group of death’ in Euro 2020 that involves France Germany Portugal and Hungary. While Hungary are least likely to qualify into the knockout rounds the other two spots will see breakneck competition. France and Germany will kick-start the first of many absorbing ties on 16 June 2021.

2. Portugal Vs Germany - 19 June 2021

The next game one cannot miss from Group F will be Portugal Vs Germany. Portugal are the defending champions and would hope to come into this game with a victory over Hungary in their opening fixture. There will be stars from both teams on the field such as former teammates Cristano Ronaldo and Toni Kroos which should make for fabulous viewing.

1. Portugal Vs France - 24 June 2021

Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal beat France in the 2016 Euro final to win the t itle

Portugal and France were the finalists in the 2016 edition of the tournament. The match was entertaining and yet closely contested. Both the outfits will renew the rivalry and look to secure one of the two qualifying spots by collecting all three points. France are the reigning world champions while Portugal are the defending European champions. This one will be a mouth-watering clash one cannot miss.

MKC,McCormick & Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RydW1wLWJhY2tlZC1zZW5hdGUtaG9wZWZ1bC1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1oYXMtZXh0ZW5zaXZlLWRlZXAtc3RhdGUtdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump-Backed Senate Hopeful Dave McCormick Has Extensive 'Deep State' Ties,"As he runs for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania Dave McCormick’s claims to his “home state” have been a source of contention on the campaign trail: the Republican hedge fund titan spent much of his youth in Pennsylvania but has lived out most of his recent adult and professional days in Connecticut.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,"A super PAC supporting Republican David McCormick's Senate run in Pennsylvania is launching a $4 million TV ad buy today its first in one of the most-watched contests of the 2024 campaign. Why it matters: Pennsylvania's race between McCormick and Democratic incumbent Bob Casey Jr. could determine which party controls the Senate next year — and is a prime opportunity for Republicans to gain a seat.

Driving the news: Keystone Renewal PAC's first ad focuses on McCormick's time at West Point and his earning a Bronze Star while serving in the Gulf War.

The ad promoting the former hedge fund CEO will run for four weeks beginning on cable broadcast and digital platforms in the Pittsburgh Scranton Harrisburg and Johnstown markets.

McMormick's campaign aims to make his military service a constant theme in his campaign against Casey who's seeking his fourth six-year term in the Senate.

McCormick is making his second run for the Senate. In 2022 he lost in the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz who went on to lose to Democrat John Fetterman in the midterm election.

Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead."

A McDonald's superfan has spent the last two years transforming her home in Richmond Virginia into a shrine for the American fast-food chain. Taylor Gecking 31 said her ""obsession"" with McDonald's started at a young age.

""My sister and I had so much fun climbing around and sliding into the ball pit. It made a mundane lunch something to look forward to"" she told the Metro.

The property which is filled with more than 100 collectibles includes a Ronald McDonald stained glass window red and yellow walls and an original golden arches sign from the 70s that Gecking collected from a real McDonald's restaurant.

Gecking told the Metro she ""still gets a rush of excitement"" when she discovers new items to add to her collection of toys. Her vegan husband on the other hand has ""no McDonald's nostalgia whatsoever.""

""For him that's thousands of books records and video games and for me it's McDonald's Funko Pops and salt and pepper shakers"" Gecking said.

Gecking collects memorabilia in antique shops markets or online. She plans on growing her collection with dreams of acquiring an original McDonald's bench that has a statue of Ronald McDonald sitting on it.

""Our whole home is full of things that are a little unusual to decorate with but my husband and I both believe in surrounding ourselves with things that make us happy"" she said.

Gecking is not the only collector of fast-food memorabilia to make headlines recently.

Percival R. Lugue from the Philippines told Insider how he became the first person to receive a Guinness World Record title for having the largest collection of fast-food restaurant toys having amassed 10000 items.

Nearly seven years later Lugue said his collection has likely doubled: ""My rough estimate of the total fast food toys at hand would be more than 20000.""

By Eric Eyre and Amelia Ferrell Knisely Mountain State Spotlight

CHARLESTON — The nation’s three largest drug distributors failed to set up effective programs to stop prescription painkillers from being diverted and sold illegally on the black market a former investigator with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration testified Wednesday at a landmark trial in Charleston.

After analyzing DEA data and the companies’ “due diligence” files James Rafalski an expert witness for the City of Huntington and Cabell County concluded the wholesale distributors — McKesson Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen — didn’t properly report suspiciously large orders of pain pills to the DEA for more than a decade.

During the trial now in its fourth week the companies’ executives have pinned much of the blame for the opioid crisis on the DEA’s failure to act. Rafalski’s testimony Wednesday provided a look into what he called the distributors’ flawed reporting practices.

“The systemic [failure] was widespread” Rafalski said. He included the Huntington market in that failure.

Paul Farrell Jr. Cabell County’s lawyer argued the drug companies never pulled the fire alarm despite numerous warnings about suspicious orders of oxycodone and hydrocodone.

“This should have been blocked” he said.

Cabell County and Huntington filed lawsuits against the drug distributors in 2017 alleging the companies caused a “scourge of death and addiction” by flooding their communities with powerful prescription painkillers. More than 3000 local governments across America have filed similar lawsuits. Cabell County and Huntington are the first to have their cases go to trial.

Rafalski’s findings echoed the conclusions of a 2018 congressional investigation into “pill’’ dumping” by the same distributors in West Virginia.

On Wednesday attorneys for the distributors suggested that doctors manufacturers like OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma and the DEA were to blame for the opioid epidemic.

The companies’ lawyers said DEA field offices didn’t keep track of reports about suspicious orders of pain pills and some offices didn’t even know that distributors were supposed to submit the reports. The DEA has never established standards to help distributors identify suspect orders from pharmacies according to the distributors.

The companies’ attorneys also pointed fingers at regional distributor Miami-Luken which shipped large quantities of prescription opioids to Cabell County. Miami-Luken closed several years ago after two of its former executives were indicted on federal charges for failing to identify and block suspicious orders from now-shuttered pharmacies in West Virginia and other states.

What’s more the distributors’ lawyers noted that the DEA approved opioid manufacturing quotas that allowed higher numbers of painkillers nationwide amid a surge of drug overdose deaths.

Rafalski testified Wednesday that distributors before 2007 would flag orders that looked suspicious but still ship the opioid drugs to pharmacies and report the questionable orders to the DEA at a later date.

Since then the companies have blocked those sales while reviewing them. Each distributor established its own program for identifying suspicious orders — typically by placing monthly limits on painkiller sales to individual pharmacies.

“We wanted to allow them flexibility” Rafalski said Wednesday of the drug distributors each setting up its own program.

The opioid crisis — first triggered when people got hooked on easily available prescription painkillers then switched to heroin and now fentanyl and methamphetamine — has been costly: thousands of lives lost families torn apart grandparents raising children overcrowded jails and soaring addiction treatment costs.

Huntington and Cabell County along with other local governments in West Virginia have opted out of a tentative $26 billion national settlement with the three distributors and with one of the manufacturers of opioids Johnson & Johnson. Farrell has said West Virginia’s portion of the “global” settlement wasn’t nearly enough. The Mountain State’s potential share has yet to be disclosed to the public.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-treatment-type-uterus-cancer-fails-trial-2024-05-09/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

The initiative supports the company’s work in expanding access to health and accelerating progress toward the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goal 3 which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all. More specifically it is focused on creating a world where no woman has to die while giving life by helping to address the first target under SDG 3 reducing the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100000 live births by 2030.

“I am so proud of our company’s longstanding commitment to our Merck for Mothers initiative which is dedicated to improving maternal health outcomes around the world” Allison Goldberg president Merck Foundation said. “Through Merck for Mothers we have now helped more than 30 million women access high-quality life-saving care around pregnancy and childbirth — surpassing our goal of reaching 25 million women by 2025. This milestone serves as a reminder that much work is left to be done and we remain committed to helping create a world where no woman has to die while giving life.”

Through wide-ranging approaches Merck for Mothers harnesses the power of public-private collaboration to strengthen health systems and mobilize solutions to address the diverse and unique needs of moms babies and families worldwide. The initiative’s milestone of 30 million women reached reflects the combined total impact of the programs and partnerships it supports in more than 70 countries including India Brazil Kenya Nigeria and the U.S.

The U.S. is the only high-income country in which maternal mortality is on the rise — where Merck for Mothers supports a variety of programs to address racial inequities in maternal health outcomes. For example with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Foundation Merck for Mothers created the Hear Her campaign to disseminate critical information on pregnancy and childbirth-related complications reaching more than 1.5 million people to date across the campaign’s website and social media channels."

Survey finds just two percent are prepared for a pet's illness or injury - NKyTribune,"By Berry Craig

Building Kentucky

Do you have a pet first aid kit at home? What about extra food and treats to lure out an injured pet that might be hiding? What about a leash collar or carrier to help transport a pet in distress? Do you know how to triage an injury while you make your way to the vet?

These are the types of crucial questions to ask yourself. A 2021 MetLife poll of pet insurance policyholders indicated that while many families keep supplies like food and medicine on hand many weren’t confident about how to respond in an emergency.

Only 2 percent of policyholders surveyed had taken a first aid course focused on pets. Only 10 percent had a pet first aid kit. And almost half (49 percent) of dog owners and 80 percent of cat owners said they needed more training.

“This matches what we see and hear every day” said Katie Blakeley vice president and head of pet insurance at MetLife. “Most people aren’t really prepared for a pet emergency but the good news is that you can take a few easy steps to be more prepared.”

Pet First Aid Tips

1. When you think about pet emergencies don’t just think about medical supplies. Pets in pain won’t react the way they do normally. Items like a muzzle leash or animal handling gloves will allow you to help them. Having a designated emergency supply of treats might also help. 2. Pet first aid classes are a good investment but much can be learned from home. The American Veterinary Medical Association provides several online resources about emergency vet care. Lessons are also available online including this one on CPR in dogs from the ACE Academy for Canine Educators. 3. Put everything in one place. Most pet owners reported owning many of the staples of a pet first aid kit – like tweezers antibiotic wipes etc. But you don’t want to be running around the house looking for supplies in an emergency.

“Of course we all hope that we never need to perform CPR or rescue an injured pet” Blakeley said. “But small emergencies are likely to happen. Learning pet first aid means you are prepared for events like minor scrapes at the dog park or attending to a cat after a scuffle with another neighborhood feline. At Metlife we urge everyone to think now about ways they can safeguard their pets in the future.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzI5L3RoZS10aW1lLWlzLW5vdy1mb3ItdGhlLWdpYW50cy10by1kZW1hbmQtbW9yZS1mcm9tLWRhbmllbC1qb25lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Time for Giants to challenge Daniel Jones like never before,"The pressure is on Daniel Jones whether or not he invites it or the Giants try to shield him from it.

It’s here and it will stay on Jones until he answers the call or wilts.

Several times on Thursday in Jones’ first interview in 143 days it felt like the third-year quarterback was trying to dodge the idea that he is primarily responsible for the Giants offense’s production.

He droned on about how “it’s on all 11 guys to do their job every play.”

Only when pressed — don’t great quarterbacks make everyone around them better? — did Jones somewhat accept the reality and accountability for 2021.

“Absolutely. I think yeah the quarterback plays a big part in it” Jones relented. “Communicating getting everyone on the same page getting the ball where it needs to be as quickly and accurately as possible. I think that’s a huge part of the equation. I certainly respect that and appreciate that responsibility.”

Daniel Jones needs to take a big step forward in his third season in the NFL to prove he is the QB the Giants think he is.

The time for talking around Jones’ expectations is over though. He has to take command. He has to take ownership of the offense and this team. He has to do it now.

If Joe Judge is going to plant his flag that “Daniel Jones is our quarterback” as he did Thursday with Deshaun Watson and Aaron Rodgers possibly available and the Giants holding ample draft capital then it is time for Jones to drop this naive act.

He can start by canning comments like “it’s not on any one person more than the other it’s about everyone executing together as a unit.” This is no time for the Giants to coddle their quarterback.

They have finally taken an aggressive approach to upgrading their roster. They are demanding more out of a player or finding someone better. There is no reason that philosophy shouldn’t apply to the most important position on the team and it shouldn’t scare Jones to say that or realize it.

It is the job.

So it is time for the Giants to challenge Jones like never before.

Jones does have a valid point that he can’t do it alone obviously.

It is not his job to call creative plays block opposing pass rushers catch the ball or pick up blitzes in the backfield. He can’t control Kadarius Toney and Kenny Golladay not attending OTAs.

But he can play better. Way better. And there is nothing wrong with saying that.

Colts coach Frank Reich is doing exactly that with his new quarterback Eagles flameout Carson Wentz.

Reich is working to build Wentz back up to his 2017 MVP form. To get him there Reich chose on Wednesday to be brutally honest about Wentz’s shortcomings in Philly to make clear those mistakes will not fly in Indy and in the process test the famously sensitive Wentz.

“There has been a lot of that discussion and it has started around ‘Just be the quarterback of this team and don’t try [to] do too much'” Reich said. “A lot of that begins in believing [in] the quality of the team around you in all phases — especially up front from the offensive line — and reminding Carson we have high standards around here in the number of sacks we take.”

Reich added of Wentz’s “hard year” in Philadelphia: “Humble pie doesn’t taste good but it is good for you.”

Back in New Jersey Judge challenges Jones too but he does it behind the scenes.

The coach didn’t directly demand improvement from Jones publicly on Thursday. He said: “I’m very pleased with the way he’s working and I’m looking for a little bit of improvement from every one of our players on a daily basis and every coach as well.”

Judge intimated that he has Jones’ back publicly but is challenging the quarterback plenty when the cameras are off.

“He just has to be the best he is every day” Judge said. “That’s what we ask of all of our players. It’s not going to be perfect all the time but we need it to be the best version you can be of yourself and as coaches we have to put you in the best position to play to your strengths.

“I’ll keep in terms of the personal conversations that me and him have or some of the things that we challenge him internally whether it’s Jason [QB coach] Jerry [Schuplinski] or myself” Judge added. “But this guy steps up every day to the plate and he comes to work every day with a plan.”

Co-owner John Mara GM Dave Gettleman and Judge constantly praise Jones’ intangibles and insist he can be a franchise quarterback. Their belief is genuine but the Giants know Jones has to get better.

They expected a dramatic improvement from his rookie season in Year 2 and he threw 11 touchdown passes in 13 1/2 games for the NFL’s 31st ranked offense.

The skill around Jones had to get better. It did. Now he has to get a lot better too.

Wentz widely considered a broken player has 49 touchdowns to 33 turnovers in 28 games the past two seasons. Jones has 38 TDs to 39 turnovers in 27 games in that same span.

Everyone knows Jones works hard. Everyone knows he’ll need his teammates’ help. But both he and the Giants should be acting like the pressure and responsibility is primarily on him.

Because that’s the harsh truth. And if Jones is all the Giants think he is he’ll be able to handle that just fine.

JUNE 1 THE CAP CAMP CUTS AND JULIO

Tuesday is important on the NFL calendar because teams can cut or trade players and spread their dead money cap cost across both the 2021 and 2022 seasons instead of eating it all this fall. That “post-June 1” benefit should lead to a second mini-wave of free agency and player transactions. Teams have less space under this year’s $182.5 million cap (down $15.7 million from 2020 due to the pandemic) and the league determined this week that the 2022 cap could rise to as high as $208.2 million. Clubs were allowed to designate player transactions as “post-June 1” moves in the past few months ahead of time but they still had to carry the player’s cost through June 1. So those with less wiggle room will finally be able to act come Tuesday if they wish.

Expect the cap-strapped Atlanta Falcons to trade Julio Jones after the June 1 deadline passes for exactly this reason. By the way I can’t understand why the L.A. Rams aren’t being talked about more as a possible suitor for Jones. GM Les Snead continues to go all-in with the Rams trying to follow the Bucs’ lead in hosting and winning a Super Bowl in their own building. This team once wanted Odell Beckham Jr. from the Giants. Coach Sean McVay got his quarterback in Matthew Stafford and surely would welcome Jones. The Falcons would have to be willing to trade Jones in the NFC but Snead worked in Atlanta from 1997-2011. The relationship is there. The Patriots also make sense for Jones who doesn’t have a no trade clause but wants to go to a contender. Just saying: never count the Rams out on these sweepstakes.

The Giants have $202 million in cap liabilities for 51 players already on their roster for the 2022 season per overthecap.com and the cap will be no higher than $208.2 million. Now everyone knows why assistant GM Kevin Abrams forecasted that next season will be “a little bit of a challenge” on Big Blue’s books.

The NFL and players’ union agreed to cut their 90-man rosters to 85 on Aug. 17 after the first preseason games to 80 on Aug. 24 after the second exhibitions and to 53 on Aug. 31 after teams’ third and final preseason tilts. This is much improved over last season’s COVID cutdown to 80-man limits early in camp that eliminated 320 jobs by early August.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvc3BvcnRzLzIwMjEvMDUvMzAvamFwYW5lc2UtYmFzZWJhbGwvanVzdGluLXNtb2FrLWdpYW50cy1oYXdrcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Giants snap 11-game losing streak against Hawks,"Justin Smoak homered and drove in three runs to lift the defending Central League champion Yomiuri Giants past the Pacific League's Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks 4-3 on Sunday in interleague action.

Barkley Won’t be a Full Participant in Camp Not a Lock for Week 1

Despite the optimism surrounding Barkley’s rehab the Giants have remained reluctant to place a timeline on their star running back’s return to the gridiron. In fact they’ve gone out of their way to specifically not pinpoint a return date. This has led to some questioning when we’ll actually get to see No. 26 man his typical workload in the Giants’ backfield.

The obvious first marker would be training camp which is expected to begin on July 27th per NJ Media Group’s Art Stapleton. However according to team insider Jordan Raanan Barkley’s participation this summer remains murky at best.

“As of last month Barkley was on track to be ready for the start of the season a source told ESPN’s Adam Schefter. But nothing is a guarantee until he gets through full practices this summer” Raanan wrote. “And that likely won’t be until later in training camp if at all. We’re probably going to have to get used to Barkley standing around and watching against his will itching to get back on the field.”

Raanan made it a point to note that there have been “no significant setbacks” since Barkley’s October surgery. Instead the 24-year-old’s likely non-participation is simply due to the timeline in correlation to his rehab process as well as Big Blue’s (rightful) bullishness to take a cautious approach with their offensive centerpiece.

“Barkley is sprinting and jumping impressing those around him even if the current plan does not include him being involved in the offseason on-field workouts with the team” Raanan added. “He is not expected to be a full participant in practices early in training camp. If he’s outside at practice during organized team activities and minicamp this spring it will be mostly to watch.”

To add further uncertainty to Barkley’s situation TMZ Sports recently spoke with Giants co-owner Jonathan Tisch who shed doubt on the running back’s availability come September 12th for the team’s Week 1 matchup against the Denver Broncos.

He [Tisch] told us he’s pleased with what he’s heard about Barkley’s rehab so far. But he added he doesn’t know if the 24-year-old will be able to begin the season on the field. Still it’s clear the Giants have no plans to rush him back … with Tisch telling us ‘don’t know don’t know’ when we asked if the tailback would be ready to go in September. Barkley May Have Workload Limited in Return Even if Barkley is a go for Week 1 it doesn’t sound as if the Giants will be ready to hand over the full reigns of the backfield to the former NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year from the jump. The team has been aggressive in their quest to build out the running back depth chart behind Barkley this offseason with the most notable addition being veteran signee Devontae Booker. More recently they’ve added rookie Gary Brightwell ex-Jaguar Ryquell Armstead and former Eagles Super Bowl hero Corey Clement to the mix — all of whom could potentially play into an early-season rotation of sorts.

“With the future a large part of the equation New York will be focusing on Barkley’s best interests and career longevity when it comes to integrating him back into the full-time mix” Raanan proclaimed. “That probably won’t be until sometime during the regular season even if the running back might want it to happen sooner.”

“The bank intends to divest its stake in Canara HSBC OBC Life Insurance Co. Ltd an associate of the bank at an appropriate time depending upon market conditions and available options” PNB mentioned in a regulatory filing as quoted by the Economic Times.

Actually the OBC maintained a 23 per cent stake in the life insurer that had subsequently come in PNB’s quota after the aforementioned merger. The Canara Bank and HSBC Insurance (Asia Pacific) Holdings Ltd are the owners of the rest of the 51 per cent and 26 per cent shares in the company.

The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas is the latest resort on the Strip to begin charging again for parking.

Beginning June 1 non-hotel guests can park their own car for free for the first hour. After that the cost for self-parking is $10 for up to four hours and $15 for four to 24 hours according to the Cosmopolitan website. Motorcycles are exempt from parking fees.

Registered hotel guests are allowed to park for free. Local residents can park free for up to three hours the Cosmopolitan website states. Locals are required to show a valid Nevada ID.

For valet parking non-hotel guests will be charged $15 dollars for up to four hours. The valet fee is $20 for four to 24 hours. Registered hotel guests are permitted to use valet parking as a complimentary service.

The return to paid parking on June 1 is the result of an increase in travel to the area the Cosmopolitan said in a statement to KSNV-TV. Starting on June 1 casinos across the state can operate at full capacity. Many resorts including the Cosmopolitan already are operating at 100 percent gaming floor capacity based on employee COVID-19 vaccination policy.

The $4.1 billion Cosmopolitan first opened in December 2010 on the west side of the Strip. It towers over the older Jockey Club just south of the Bellagio.

MGM Caesars Restore Fees

Other resorts on the Strip also are reinstating parking fees that were waived last year at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.

Also beginning June 1 paid self-parking is returning to the MGM Resorts properties. Most of these resorts are on the west side of the Strip including some near T-Mobile Arena home of the NHL’s Vegas Golden Knights. Special parking rates apply for Golden Knights games and other arena events. Payment for these events can be arranged ahead of time on the MGM Resorts website.

At the Caesars Entertainment resorts on the Strip self-parking is free for hotel guests and Nevada residents. The first hour is free for all guests. Fees for non-hotel guests range from $12 to $18 according to the company’s website. Many of the Caesars Entertainment properties are on the east side of the Strip.

‘Tone Deaf’ on Paid Parking

Parking fees are a sore spot for many visitors and Las Vegas residents especially for those who remember decades of free parking.

Bob Coffin a former Nevada legislator and Las Vegas City Council member has written on his Facebook page that casinos need to “wake up and smell the Bermuda grass” on the paid parking issue.

Lord please save our city from hedge funds and their genius at making empty husks out of once-great properties” he wrote on May 25.

Coffin also reacted to parking fees in a 2017 Facebook post.

“The CEO class on the Strip needs to hear something. Something they are either too young too new or too tone deaf to understand. Hear it from this 74-year-old resident of 66 years with 50 years of political experience” he wrote four years ago. “Your gaming taxes are low because of your long friendly connection to the citizens of Nevada. … Now that connection is becoming tenuous because of changes like this.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJveGluZ3NjZW5lLmNvbS9kZXZpbi1oYW5leS1qb3JnZS1saW5hcmVzLWxpdmUtcmVzdWx0cy1mcm9tLW1hbmRhbGF5LWJheS1sYXMtdmVnYXMtLTE1ODAwNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Devin Haney-Jorge Linares - LIVE Results From Mandalay Bay In Las Vegas,"LAS VEGAS – Reshat Mati’s knockout streak ended Saturday but his unblemished record remains intact.

The welterweight from Staten Island out-pointed Ryan Pino by unanimous decision in what was at times a competitive six-rounder on the Devin Haney-Jorge Linares undercard at Mandalay Bay’s Michelob Ultra Arena. Judge Lisa Giampa scored all six rounds for Mati (60-54) but judges Max De Luca (58-56) and Chris Migliore (58-56) had it closer.

Mati (10-0 7 KOs) had won his previous five bouts by knockout or technical knockout. Puerto Rico’s Pino (8-7-2 4 KOs) is 0-6-2 in his past eight bouts but he has lost by knockout only once and not since his third fight in August 2015.

Pino blasted Mati with a left hook after Mati connected with yet another right hand in the sixth round. Mati landed one last overhand right just before the sixth and final round concluded.

Mati rocked Pino with a right hand late in the fifth round.

Pino backed up Mati with a right hand early in the fourth round. Mati connected to Pino’s head and body later in the fourth.

Mati’s left hook to the body and right hand up top backed Pino into the ropes later in the fourth round.

Pino pressed the action for much of what was a very competitive third round.

Mati’s right hand backed Pino into the ropes in the second round but Pino waved him forward. Pino connected with a right hand of his own later in the second round that knocked Mati off balance.

Mati and Pino each landed flush punches in an exchange just before the second round ended. Pino landed a left hook in the middle minute of the first round that caught Mati clean.

Earlier Saturday Ramla Ali boxed her way to remaining unbeaten.

The Somalian featherweight was the busier more effective fighter overall in her six-round fight against Mikayla Nebel. The London resident won all six rounds on the cards of judges Adalaide Byrd Tim Cheatham and Eric Cheek each of whom scored their fight 60-54.

The 31-year-old Ali improved to 3-0. Each of her three pro bouts have gone the distance.

Las Vegas’ Nebel fell to 4-9.

Ali worked well off her jab in the sixth and final round. She kept Nebel at a distance better in those two minutes than she did during the previous two rounds.

Nebel began pressing the action in the fourth and fifth rounds when she was more active than Ali. A left hook by Ali backed up Nebel late in the third round.

Ali landed two hard right hands in the opening minute of the second round. Ali’s right hand made Nebel retreat with about 35 seconds to go in the first round.

In the first fight Saturday one of Haney’s proteges produced a quick knockout.

Amari Jones a 19-year-old junior middleweight prospect knocked out Jonathan Ryan Burrs in the first round of their scheduled four-rounder. Jones dropped Burrs once before referee Mike Ortega stopped their fight with four seconds remaining in the opening round.

Las Vegas’ Jones wobbled Burrs with a right hand with just under a minute remaining in the first round. Another right by Jones knocked Burrs flat on his back with 22 seconds to go in the opening round.

Burrs (3-4 0 KOs) of Frederick Maryland beat Ortega’s count. Once he stumbled backward Ortega waved an end to their brief bout.

Burrs was knocked out for the first time in seven professional fights.

Cabin-air filters were once exclusive to only the upper reaches of vehicle model ranges but have permeated lineups over the preceding decades to become a nearly ubiquitous feature. These days they come standard in what seems like a majority of vehicles currently on sale and some luxury manufacturers have touted their systems as being able to filter out the allergens that unfortunately irritate so many of us. Any discussion of cabin-air filtration would also be remiss without mentioning Tesla which touts its bioweapon defense mode.

While Tesla’s systems rely on HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters which are widely available in the aftermarket from a variety of original equipment manufacturers such as Bosch BMW is expanding the availability of so-called nano-particle cabin-air filters within its lineup. Unveiled in the Fall 2020 the filters use what’s referred to as nano-fleece made of nano-fiber sitting on top of a traditional activated carbon layer. The filters are only available with optional four-zone climate control and initially came standard on X7 and were offered as an option on the 7 Series and 8 Series along with the X5 and X6 and all of their respective M derivatives.

Although HEPA filters can remove particles as small as 0.3 micron from the air BMW’s nano-particle design takes things to another level capturing particles as small 100 nanometers in size or 0.1 micron. BMW says its nano-particle filters can strain 40% more harmful particles from the air than current mainstream filter technologies including carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide bacterial microbes allergies soot emissions particulate and ultra-fine dust.

“BMW has been working actively on state-of-the-art filter systems since the early nineties” says Dr. Christian Rosskopf an expert at the BMW Group. “However the development we have seen in recent years including and perhaps in particular those we see in the fight against urban pollution has meant that we have sped up the introduction of our latest filter technologies.”

BMW introduced combination filters which marry activated carbon with traditional air particulate filtration into a single unit in 1998. As air quality declined and become a regional issue in Asia BMW responded by making fine-dust filters standard equipment in China in 2015 and in South Korea starting in 2020. Fine-dust filters were also made optionally available for all BMW markets the same year.

Four-zone climate control with nano-particle filters will soon be optionally available for the BMW 5 Series and M5. The system also includes an air flush mode which cleanses most of the cabin air in a matter of minutes. Cabin air can be exchanged manually or as part of pre-drive conditioning in the BMW ConnectedDrive app.—Alex Tock

Elon Musk made waves in February when he announced that Tesla was buying $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and accepting the world’s most popular cryptocurrency as payment for its vehicles — yet another first for Musk in the auto industry.

The revolution was short-lived.

What is often left out of the discussion about Bitcoin is how terrible it is for the environment. The powerful specialized computers that are needed to mine Bitcoin gobble up enormous amounts of energy which is why most of it is mined in China where electricity is dirt cheap and regulations are lax. Tesla — a company whose entire brand is rooted in sustainable energy — dropped its Bitcoin bid about three months later. Musk cited environmental concerns and the huge volume of fossil fuels that must be burned to produce a single coin. On May 12 Musk’s mea culpa wiped $365 billion from the cryptocurrency market in a single day.

But not all companies share Musk’s concern with green energy. Bitcoin is big and getting bigger with some of the biggest corporations in America jumping on the bandwagon and accepting Bitcoin as payment. Here are the top 10 players in the game.

Microsoft

Microsoft became an early adopter of Bitcoin in 2014 when it began accepting the cryptocurrency as payment for games apps and other digital content for platforms like Windows Phone and Xbox. Bitcoin was still largely unknown in 2014 and many of those who were familiar heard about it for all the wrong reasons. It was a year of drama and scandal with the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox collapsing into bankruptcy after a flurry of frauds hacks and incidents that saw hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins lost. At that time a bar in New York City accepted Bitcoin so did a few car services and restaurants but very few other major companies to speak of — except for two.

If anyone was going to beat Microsoft to the punch it makes sense that it would be the company that blazed the trail for modern digital payments. Microsoft began accepting Bitcoin at the end of 2014 in December — three months after PayPal got on board in September. Back then Bitcoin was trading as XBT instead of BTC. As a testament to how unfamiliar the concept was then CNN described Bitcoin as “an independent government-less currency.” PayPal’s move was intended to draw businesses to its platform not consumers. That draw was that Bitcoin’s transaction fees were far lower than the profit-killing 2%-3% charge that businesses were paying for credit card transactions.

Before Microsoft went crypto and even before PayPal Overstock.com was blazing the trail that those giants would follow. As early as 2018 CNN was reporting that Overstock was “basically a crypto company now” an exaggeration based on the online retailer’s heavy investment in blockchain technology. By that time — before COVID boosted Overstock to its current status as one of the hottest e-commerce platforms in the world — it was already a Bitcoin veteran. In January 2014 — a full nine months before PayPal took the plunge in September of that same year and nearly a year before Microsoft — Overstock became the first major retailer to accept Bitcoin as payment.

In May 2019 a cryptocurrency dam broke when a payments startup called Flexa joined forces with Gemini a digital currency company owned by the Facebook-famous Winklevoss twins. The partnership’s platform allowed big retailers to incorporate Flexa into the digital scanners they were already using to accept phone-based payments through Apple Pay and other digital wallets. The technology instantly converted Bitcoins into dollars for seamless purchases. One of the first of those big retailers to adopt the technology was Whole Foods. Whole Foods is owned by Amazon but Amazon itself does not as of now accept Bitcoin for purchases made through the world’s largest online retailer.

Etsy itself doesn’t have a platform for accepting Bitcoin as payment sitewide but the independent sellers who populate its platform can accept crypto in their individual shops if they choose. It’s up to the seller to add an “other” payment method option at checkout. When buyers click that option they’ll be able to message the buyer with their payment preferences — Bitcoin in this case. The seller then responds with a Bitcoin address to complete the transaction. The Etsy Community forum has a special page dedicated to Bitcoin with tutorials that explain how sellers can advertise that they accept Bitcoin and how to make the process go smoothly.

In March 2020 just as masks began covering faces across America and the world Starbucks announced it was joining the Bitcoin revolution — kind of.

You can’t pay for your Frappuccinos with Bitcoin at the register but you can add Bitcoin — along with things like gift card balances and frequent-flyer miles — to the Starbucks app and pay that way. That upgrade was made possible by a third-party digital wallet app called Bakkt that converts Bitcoin to dollars to make payments not just possible but instantaneous.

Home Depot too is using the Winklevoss/Flexa system — the same one that allowed Whole Foods to accept Bitcoin through its own digital scanners without investing in new hardware. Retailers have to submit balance sheets in dollars no matter what form of payment they accept which was long a big stumbling block for companies that wanted to accept Bitcoin but didn’t know how. Flexa converts Bitcoin to dollars instantaneously which gives both parties what they want. The buyer gets to spend their Bitcoins when they buy their paint and Ryobi tools and Home Depot gets the green dollars they require in exchange.

As part of a global Bitcoin rollout the company started with Rakuten.com in the U.S. before expanding the new service to its counterparts in Germany and Austria. Rakuten made it possible by integrating the Bitnet payment processing platform into its own marketplaces. It has since developed Rakuten Wallet which has expanded to support altcoins like Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum. Users can now charge their Rakuten Cash balance using crypto assets.

Twitch

Twitch is the 800-pound gorilla on the streaming video platform block. Like Whole Foods Twitch is owned by Amazon. Also like Whole Foods it now accepts cryptocurrency — and not just Bitcoin. Users can pay in Bitcoin but also Bitcoin Cash and Ether as well as lesser-used coins like BUSD PAX GUSD USDC and XRP. Twitch was one of the earliest adopters of crypto adding it as a payment option in 2014. That however ended in 2019 when Twitch quietly removed its Bitcoin service. In June 2020 however Twitch brought that capability back to the delight of its crypto-conscious users.

A bug in Microsoft Edge 91 is displaying alerts for “use recommended browser settings” when users launch the updated Chromium browser on Windows 10.

The “use recommended browser settings” pop-up alert is Microsoft’s attempt to promote its browser with the latest piece of ‘recommendation’ to use Microsoft Edge with Bing being delivered when users launch the browser after updating to version 91.

In what is apparently being delivered to almost everyone a small pop-up panel titled “assistance from Microsoft” is appearing on the new tab page highlighting that you should use Microsoft Edge with Bing as the default search engine to get “world-class performance privacy and productivity”.

As you can see in the above screenshot there are two options: Use Microsoft recommended browser settings (Microsoft Edge with Bing) and Don’t update your browser settings.

If you do click on the first option your taskbar or screen will flash and the default browser will switch to Microsoft Edge (with Bing).

While this is annoying it is still all well and good if the alert appears only one time. In some cases users have found a rather annoying bug where even if they dismiss the recommendation the browser won’t actually respect the decision and will continue to show the alerts when you relaunch Edge.

It appears that Edge 91 quietly enabled a feature that will allow Edge to show active messages recommending specific features and workflows based on your activities.

How to disable the “use recommended browser settings” alert in Microsoft Edge

If you’re still getting the alert in Microsoft Edge there’s an experimental flag that you can disable to stop the nagging.

Open Microsoft Edge > edge://flags.

Search for edge-show-feature-recommendations

Set the flag to “disabled”.

Relaunch Microsoft Edge

As ever Microsoft should be careful about these alerts especially when Chromium-based Edge is actually growing.

It’s possible that Microsoft is aware of the reports and is looking into ways to stop the nagging without causing additional problems for users.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlnbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbWljcm9zb2Z0LWZsaWdodC1zaW11bGF0b3ItYmFzZS1nYW1lLXNpemUtaW4taGFsZi0xNzAtODPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Flight Simulator Update Cuts Its 170 GB Base Game Size in Half,"Microsoft Flight Simulator's Update 1.16.2.0 not only brings with it a ton of fixes but it also cuts its base game size of 170 GB in half to 83 GB.

The new update is available now and the reduction in file size was made possible thanks to to the team performing ""some optimization for the initial full download"" of Microsoft Flight Simulator.

This is another example of developers working to make their games take up less space and follows Fortnite's patch that made it 60GB smaller on PC and Call of Duty: Warzone's patch that reduced the file size between 10.9 GB and 14.2 GB.

File size has been a big issue for some especially those who wish to have both Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Modern Warfare/Warzone installed on one system. Activision even said that 500GB PS4 owners may need to ""make room"" if they wanted these games installed with all the modes and packs available.

We recently took a look at why these video games have such huge install sizes and it is due to a combination of factors including games getting bigger in scope problems with hardware inefficiencies and more.

Microsoft Surface Book 3,"Apple MacBook Pro (M1) Vs. Microsoft Surface Book 3 CRN compares Apple’s 13-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 chip against Microsoft’s latest Surface Book convertible laptop featuring 10th-gen Intel Core processors and optional Nvidia GeForce graphics.

Head-To-Head Apple is seeking to turn up the heat on its PC rivals with the launch of its M1 processor in its latest Macs including the 13-inch MacBook Pro. While many Windows 10 laptops such as the Microsoft Surface Book 3 continue to be powered by Intel Core processors Apple has brought forward its high-performance M1 chip in a bid to crush the PC competition on speed. But does the new MacBook Pro with M1 really deliver? And what about other key features and specs such as battery life display and portability? Notably Microsoft’s Surface Book 3 does have some unique features to offer that you won’t find on the M1 MacBook Pro especially when it comes to the display and graphics. For instance on GPU the Surface Book 3 can be outfitted with a high-powered discrete graphics card up to the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti. The Surface Book 3 with 10th-gen Intel chips is still a performance heavyweight when it comes to CPU performance too—and can also be configured with a higher amount of RAM than the M1 MacBook Pro. Clearly the new MacBook Pro with M1 and Surface Book 3 are the professional-tier notebooks from Apple and Microsoft in contrast to the more consumer-oriented MacBook Air and Surface Laptop 4. But which of the notebooks the MacBook Pro with M1 or the Surface Book 3 is ideal for you? In the following slides the CRN Test Center compares the Apple MacBook Pro (M1) vs Microsoft’s Surface Book 3 on price key features and specs. Display It’s not likely that you’ll be disappointed with the display quality on either the 13.3-inch MacBook Pro with M1 or the Surface Book 3. Both notebooks offer terrific LCD displays with colorful and vibrant screen technology—Apple’s Retina display for the MacBook Pro and Microsoft’s PixelSense technology on the Surface Book 3 display. But the Surface Book 3 stands out in a few ways when it comes to the display. For starters the Surface Book 3 display is a touch screen whereas the MacBook Air with M1 (like all other Macs) does not offer a touch option. The Surface Book 3 also comes in two different sizes—a smaller model that has a 13.5-inch display and a larger version with a 15-inch screen. By contrast while the MacBook Pro is also available in a larger size—at 16 inches—that model does not yet come with the M1 processor. (Rumors suggest that Apple is waiting to update its 16-inch MacBook Pro with the next generation of its M-series processor possibly called the M1X or M2.) But the size options and touch screen are not even the most striking differences on display for the M1 MacBook Pro vs the Surface Book 3 comparison. Rather it’s the fact that Microsoft’s Surface Book 3 offers a unique design that lets you detach the display from the keyboard base. You can then use the display as a standalone tablet or flip the display around and re-attach it to the base facing the other direction for use in presentation mode or stand mode. In terms of resolution the Surface Book 3 offers a bit more in the way of pixels potentially enabling a crisper image. The 13.5-inch model offers display resolution of 267 pixels per inch (ppi) while the 15-inch Surface Book 3 features resolution of 260 ppi. The M1 MacBook Pro offers screen resolution of 227 ppi.

CPU GPU and RAM The 13-inch MacBook Pro is among the first devices to come equipped with Apple’s high-performance M1 processor. The M1 is an Arm-based chip featuring an eight-core CPU and an eight-core GPU. The eight-core CPU consists of four cores focused on offering strong performance for demanding tasks along with four cores that enable battery efficiency for less-intensive tasks. Microsoft’s Surface Book is powered by quad-core 10th-gen Intel Core processors. For the 13.5-inch model there are two choices—the Core i5 (specifically the i5-1035G7) or the Core i7 (the i7-1065G7). The 15-inch model is only available with the Core i7-1065G7. The Surface Book 3 processors are from Intel’s previous generation of chips with the latest Intel Core processors coming from the company’s 11th-gen portfolio. For CPU performance benchmark scores point to a major performance advantage for the MacBook Pro with M1 even when it’s facing off with the fastest Surface Book 3. Geekbench 5 scores for Apple’s M1 and Intel’s Core i7-1065G7 show the M1 coming out well ahead in both single-core and multi-core CPU benchmarks. The M1’s CPU performance advantage should be most apparent on more-demanding multi-core tasks according to the Geekbench 5 results. But GPU performance is another story—something that should be of note to anyone looking to use their laptop for gaming. Only the Surface Book 3 has an option for discrete graphics. The 13.5-inch model (with Core i7) comes equipped with Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1650 with Max-Q (offering 4 GB of GDDR5 graphics memory). The 15-inch model goes even bigger on graphics capabilities with Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1660 Ti with Max-Q and 6 GB of GDDR6 graphics memory. Benchmarks from GFXBench 4.0 show a GPU advantage for either graphics card—but especially for the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti which offers significantly stronger GPU performance across a number of different tests according to the benchmarks. Additionally the Surface Book 3 gets a further performance boost from its option for including up to 32 GB of RAM. The 13.5-inch model can be configured with 8 GB 16 GB or 32 GB of RAM while the 15-inch model is available with 16 GB or 32 GB. The M1 MacBook Pro is offered with 8 GB or 16 GB of RAM.

Portability and Chassis While both devices in our comparison are workhorses on performance neither is going to rank high on any lists of the most-portable laptops. Still the 13-inch MacBook Pro with M1 does come out ahead on portability with its weight of 3 pounds and thickness of 0.61 of an inch. The starting weight for the Surface Book 3 is 3.38 pounds (for the 13.5-inch model with Core i5). The 13.5-inch model with Core i7 weighs in at 3.62 pounds while the 15-inch Surface Book 3 is a full 40-percent heavier than the M1 MacBook Pro at 4.2 pounds. All variants of the Surface Book 3 measure 0.9 of an inch thick on the hinge side of the laptop. In terms of the metals used in the chassis of each laptop the MacBook Pro is made from aluminum while the Surface Book 3 opts for magnesium. On colors the MacBook Pro with M1 has two choices—Silver or Space Gray—while the Surface Book 3 comes only in Platinum.

Collaboration and Battery Life With video and audio conferencing now a bigger focus for so many workers Apple has outfitted the M1 MacBook Pro with several collaboration-friendly updates. Those include the addition of a “studio-quality” array of three mics along with Apple’s latest camera image signal processor—which enables sharper images and “more detail in shadows and highlights on video calls”—for the notebook’s 720p FaceTime HD camera according to the company. The MacBook Pro also offers stereo speakers with support for Dolby Atmos playback. The Surface Book 3 offers an even higher-resolution front-facing webcam though which enables 1080p HD video. A rear-facing camera offers 1080p HD video as well. Other collaboration features include dual far-field “studio” mics and stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos. On battery life both notebooks promise long usage times without needing to recharge. Microsoft is promising up to 17.5 hours of usage for 15-inch Surface Laptop 3 while the 13.5-inch model offers battery life of up to 15.5 hours according to the company. Those impressive figures are actually surpassed by the M1-powered MacBook Pro however—with Apple promising up to 20 hours of battery life for the MacBook Pro with M1. That’s thanks in large part to the M1 itself which includes four high-efficiency cores for conserving the battery. To put the M1’s capabilities on power conservation in perspective the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Intel promises only half that amount of battery life—10 hours.

Ports and Storage In terms of ports the Surface Book 3 offers greater variety than the MacBook Pro with M1 which features two Thunderbolt / USB-C ports only. By contrast the Surface Book 3 comes with one USB-C port two USB-A ports and a full-size SD card slot. Thus buyers of the Surface Book 3 are somewhat less likely to need to carry around dongles for their connector needs. On storage the MacBook Pro and the 15-inch Surface Book 3 have identical SSD options—256GB 512GB 1TB or 2TB. The 13.5-inch Surface Book 3 is configurable with 256GB 512GB or 1TB of SSD. Both Apple and Microsoft have touted major gains on SSD speed—with Apple ascribing faster SSD speeds to the use of the M1 chip and Microsoft touting the Surface Book 3’s solid-state drive as “the fastest SSD we have ever shipped.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvbWljcm9zb2Z0LXJ1c3NpYW4taGFja2Vycy11c2VkLTQtbmV3LW1hbHdhcmUtaW4tdXNhaWQtcGhpc2hpbmcv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxlZXBpbmdjb21wdXRlci5jb20vbmV3cy9zZWN1cml0eS9taWNyb3NvZnQtcnVzc2lhbi1oYWNrZXJzLXVzZWQtNC1uZXctbWFsd2FyZS1pbi11c2FpZC1waGlzaGluZy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft: Russian hackers used 4 new malware in USAID phishing,"Microsoft states that a Russian hacking group used four new malware families in recent phishing attacks impersonating the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

Thursday night the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) disclosed that the Russian-backed hacking group APT29 also known as Nobelium had compromised the Constant Contact account for USAID.

Using this legitimate marketing account the threat actors impersonated USAID in phishing emails sent to approximately 3000 email accounts at more than 150 different organizations including government agencies and organizations devoted to international development humanitarian and human rights work.

New malware used by Nobelium

In a second blog post released Friday night Microsoft provides details on four new malware families used by Nobelium in these recent attacks.

The four new families include an HTML attachment named 'EnvyScout' a downloader known as 'BoomBox' a loader known as 'NativeZone' and a shellcode downloader and launcher named 'VaporRage.'

EnvyScout

EnvyScout is a malicious HTML/JS file attachment used in spear-phishing emails that attempts to steal the NTLM credentials of Windows accounts and drops a malicious ISO on a victim's device.

Distributed as a file named NV.html when opened the HTML file will attempt to load an image from a file:// URL. When doing this Windows may send the logged-in user's Windows NTLM credentials to the remote site which attackers can capture and brute-force to reveal the plain text password.

Loading a remote image using the file:// URL

Microsoft states that the attachment is also used to convert an embedded text blob into a malicious ISO saved as NV.img to the local file system.

NV.html attachment saving the ISO image

""At this stage of infection the user is expected to open the downloaded ISO NV.img by double clicking it"" explains Microsoft.

When the ISO image opens Windows will show the user a shortcut named NV that executes the hidden BOOM.exe which is part of the new BoomBox malware family described below.

Contents of NV.img ISO file

Security researcher Florian Roth discovered another phishing campaign pretending to be from the Embassy of Belgium using this same malware attachment.

Phishing campaign impersonating the Embassy of Belgium

BoomBox

Microsoft is tracking the BOOM.exe file in the ISO image as 'BoomBox' and states that it is used to download two encrypted malware files to the infected device from DropBox.

After decrypting the downloaded files BoomBox will save them as %AppData%MicrosoftNativeCacheNativeCacheSvc.dll and %AppData%SystemCertificatesCertPKIProvider.dll and execute them using rundll32.exe.

NativeCacheSvc.dll is configured to launch automatically when a user logs into Windows and is used to launch CertPKIProvider.dll.

As a final stage the BoomBox malware will gather information about the Windows domain encrypts the collected data and then sends it to a remote server under the attacker's control.

""As the final reconnaissance step if the system is domain-joined BoomBox executes an LDAP query to gather data such as distinguished name SAM account name email and display name of all domain users via the filter (&(objectClass=user)(objectCategory=person))"" Microsoft explains.

NativeZone

Microsoft detects the NativeCacheSvc.dll file as a new malware loader called 'NativeZone.'

This malware is dropped and configured by BoomBox to start automatically when a user logs into Windows.

When started via rundll32.exe it will launch the CertPKIProvider.dll malware that Microsoft detects as 'VaporRage.'

VaporRage

The fourth malware used in these attacks is called 'VaporRage' and it is the CertPKIProvider.dll file described in the previous NativeZone section.

When launched the malware will connect back to a remote command and control server where it will register itself with the attackers and then repeatedly connect back to the remote site for a shellcode to download.

When shellcodes are downloaded the malware will execute them to perform various malicious activities including the deployment of Cobalt Strike beacons.

The same group behind SolarWinds attack

The hacking group behind these attacks is believed to be the same group behind the SolarWinds supply-chain attack.

This group is tracked as Nobelium (Microsoft) NC2452 (FireEye) StellarParticle (CrowdStrike) SolarStorm (Palo Alto Unit 42) and Dark Halo (Volexity).

SolarWinds stated that the attack cost them $3.5 million in expenses but is expecting additional costs as time goes on.

The US government formally accused the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (tracked as APT29 The Dukes or Cozy Bear) as the group behind the SolarWinds attack."

He speaks about how beyond COVID-19 this discovery is set to cure genetic diseases and how he is working on other medical technologies that target blood disease and multiple sclerosis.

A decade before the global coronavirus crisis struck a stem cell biologist at Harvard Medical School created a company that would one day become a household name.

Prof. Derrick Rossi and his team had figured out that modified mRNA a molecule that gives DNA instructions on how to behave could be used to treat disease.

They named the company Moderna – shorthand for modified mRNA – and last December its COVID-19 vaccine was approved and is now being distributed around the world.

In January Malta became the first county in Europe to receive the Moderna vaccine appropriate perhaps given its founder’s history.

“My family was a working class family and we’d never take trips – except to Malta” Rossi says. He was six years old when he first visited the island travelling from Canada where he was born.

Derrick Rossi’s Maltese parents Fred and Agnes Rossi visiting Harvard Medical School.

His mother Agnes Psaila was from Qormi while his father Alfred Rossi was from Valletta. Both were born in the 1930s at a time leading up to World War II. His mother lost her father to the war when he was hit by shrapnel and a few years later her mother died. She was raised by her eldest sister who married a British soldier and they eventually emigrated to Canada with the whole family in the late 1940s.

Meanwhile his father travelled to Canada with some friends as a teenager and never returned to Malta. His parents who have both passed away met in Canada and got married at a young age and went on to have five children. Rossi was the youngest born nine years after the fourth child.

Sitting in his home in Boston the US Prof. Rossi speaks about his Maltese roots. He recalls trips to Malta where they would visit the Rossi family grave at the Addolorata Cemetery.

They usually rented a flat in Sliema and enjoyed walking along the front taking trips to Valletta Marsaxlokk and Mdina. As Rossi grew up he would drive around the island which is why “I know my way around Malta pretty well” he says. His last trip was around 2014 before his mother died.

Passion for molecular biology

Rossi knew what career path he wanted from a very young age. When he was in high school in Canada he took a biology course and was introduced to molecular biology.

“I knew I wanted to be a molecule biologist as the inner workings of cells and life was fascinating to me” he says.

After high school he travelled a lot. He went to the University of Toronto and got his bachelor’s degree in molecular science. Then he took a year off and travelled to Africa hitch-hiking through central Africa for five months which was “pretty amazing”. He then got his master’s degree in Toronto and after that went on to do his PhD in Paris.

But he never completed it as he got “medically exhausted” following a lifestyle of studying and partying all night. He did some more travelling before heading to Finland where he completed his PhD and published several papers. This paved the way to his doctoral fellowship and he eventually got a faculty position at Harvard Medical School.

Curing genetic diseases

In 2008 he started working on the science that led to Moderna which he co-founded in 2010. He was on the board of directors but never joined the company as he retained his position at Harvard.

Back then Moderna was not about vaccines. “It was a stem cell story. We developed modified mRNA technology to treat as many genetic diseases as we could” he says.

In simple terms modified mRNA is a molecule that gives DNA instructions on how to behave. DNA is a passive molecule. It holds the code to life but does not “do” anything. In order to “do” you need active molecules which are the proteins the worker bees of cells.

Take whatever vaccine is offered without allowing stories of side effects to scare you

RNA (mRNA) is the middleman – the messenger that carries the genetic coding from the DNA so that cells know what protein to make.

Scientists have been aware of the mRNA molecule since the 1950s. What Rossi and his team did was figure out a way how to inject mRNA into cells without killing them. They did this by modifying it. The discovery that it could be inserted into cells to produce proteins opened up a world of possibilities for the medical uses of mRNA technology.

All vaccines are better than COVID-19

Then in 2020 COVID-19 struck. The coronavirus vaccine was the first mRNA application that became a product. It was the basis of the creation of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. Other vaccines like Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca followed different models (using double-stranded DNA instead).

But Rossi’s advice is to take whatever vaccine is offered without allowing stories of side effects to scare you.

“If a vaccine has been approved you should get it. There are rare side effects but what is true is that the risk of getting sick or dying from COVID-19 is millions of times greater than your chance of getting a rare event from a vaccine… Get the vaccine that’s offered to you and get it quickly. The variants are evolving all the time – so everyone should get vaccinated” he says.

Beyond the vaccine there are many other products in the making from mRNA. Soon mRNA therapeutics might be tailored to instruct a person’s immune system to fight their specific type of cancer for example.

Rossi left Moderna in 2015 but as a shareholder he retains a significant amount of stock in the company now worth $60 billion. Since then he founded four other Biotech companies that include: Intellia Therapeutics that is developing revolutionary genome editing therapies to cure genetic diseases; Magenta Therapeutics focusing on haematopoietic (blood) stem cell transplantation; Stelexis Therapeutics which develops new medication for treating cancerous stem cells; and Convelo Therapeutics that is developing a new class of medicines that could benefit multiple sclerosis patients.

Beware false STEM cell technology

Rossi whose expertise lies in stem cells and blood and blood diseases cautions about small clinics making false claims related to stem cell technologies.

This is also happening in Malta. The Association of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgeons of Malta recently warned against stem-cell interventions being practised saying any benefits are unproven benefit with an unclear scientific basis and resulting in “uncontrolled and unethical experimentation on patients”.

Rossi knows all too well about this.

“There’s a problem around the world. There is a big industry that is taking money from people who want treatment for disease and are willing to pay thousands for that hope. But there is one stem cell approved therapy and that’s bone marrow transplantation – it works and saves lives and happens in real hospitals and not small clinics that spring up” he says.

Addicted to good science

Rossi retired from academia a few years ago but his passion to make a difference and develop life-changing medical technology remains strong.

“I wanted to retire and take my kids to school every day and spend time with my family. I’ve been fortunate enough to have had such success that I don’t need to work anymore” he says adding that he and his wife Nina have three daughters Inka Lumi and Oona.

Although he is retired he remains active. “I have a hard time saying no to good science so people are always coming to me and pitching ideas” he smiles.

And at the moment he has a new-found research goal. “Something I am passionate about now is a project focussed on treating a very big global health problem that no one in Pharma is working on as there is no money in it. 150000 people die every year from snake bites. Most are in remote areas. I want to do something about this.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYW5zLmNvbS9qYW1haWNhLXRvcHMtdHJhdmVsLWxpc3QtZm9yLXNjaWVudGlzdC13aG8tZGV2ZWxvcGVkLW1vZGVybmEtdmFjY2luZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jamaica Tops Travel List for Scientist Who Developed Moderna Vaccine,"The African American viral immunologist credited with the development of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett provided a strong travel endorsement for Jamaica on the “Lawrence O’Donnell Show” on American television network MSNBC.

Dr. Corbett participated in an MSNBC town hall meeting where Dr. Joan Cephas and her son Matthew shared one of their reasons for deciding to get vaccinated namely their love of travel. Matthew added that he had already booked his first post-vaccination trip to Jamaica. Dr. Corbett then revealed that she had family connections in Jamaica and also wanted to take a vacation in the island nation. She said that her brother-in-law comes from Jamaica and that she was happy that Matthew would be able to visit there. “I told him that I’m gonna hop in his suitcase. as I need a break” she added.

Donnie Dawson the deputy director of tourism for the Americas said that this kind of publicity is good for Jamaica telling The Gleaner newspaper that “unexpected positive publicity from prominent high-level sources” is always welcome and that Dr. Corbett’s endorsement was “a great boost.”

Dr. Corbett’s Jamaican travel endorsement was the second positive global boost for the country this past weekend. Germany declared that Jamaica is no longer considered a risk area for contracting the COVID-19 virus as of May 23 2021.

Dr. Corbett currently works at the Vaccine Research Center at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda Maryland. She has a Ph.D. in microbiology and immunology from the University of North Carolina. She was appointed to the Vaccine Research Center in 2014 and currently serves as the scientific lead of the facility’s Coronavirus Team. In February of 2021 Dr. Corbett was featured on the “Time 100 Next” list of Time magazine in the “innovators” category. Her profile on the list was written by Dr. Anthony Fauci the director of the National Institutes of Health who said that she was “right at the forefront of the development of the vaccine” and that she “has been central to the development of the Moderna mRNA vaccine and the Eli Lilly therapeutic monoclonal antibody that were first to enter clinical trials in the US.” Dr. Corbett also works toward rebuilding trust with vaccine-hesitant populations including the Black community by presenting educational programs about the COVID-19 vaccine’s development to Black Health Matters.

Since stepping into the consumerism era the brands make windfall and turn rags to riches in one fell swoop. Judging consumer psyche is indeed an uphill task and the business pundits are in constant search of digging what lies deep inside a satisfied customer's heart. Nonetheless not every time the things emerge out perfectly. The flops render irreparable loss of credibility and money to the daring entrepreneur. PepsiCo

Here we would tell you about the 15 biggest product flops in history. But before let's have a look at our ranking criteria.

As business loss is purely a sensitive matter and the companies often restrict the loss of secrets. Hence judging the actual loss of each mega flop would be a wild guess at best. Instead the flop's magnitude could be best ascertained by the company's revenue size: the bigger the company the higher the risk to credibility. You will notice a lot of major companies in this list including HP Inc (NYSE: HPQ) Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) Coors (now part of Molson Coors Beverage Co Class B (NYSE: TAP)) Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) Coca-Cola Consolidated Inc (NASDAQ: COKE) and PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP).

Let's start our list of 15 biggest product flops in history.

Biggest Product Flops in History

15. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial Game (Annual Revenue: 80.1 million USD)

Remembered as the worst video game in history the Extra-Terrestrial for 2600 Atari is at number 15 in our biggest 15 product flops. Atari was the biggest gaming flop and commercial disaster in 1982. The game at best was a mess leaving players disoriented and distressed. Thousands of copies went unsold compelling Atari to bury them up in landfills. Furthermore the game designer Warshaw had to give up the career for a lifetime.

14. Twitter Peek (Annual Revenue: 3.7 billion USD)

Next on the list of the 15 biggest product flops in history is Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) Peek. The Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR)-only device in the era of smartphones was a harebrained idea at best. Who would bother to carry two gadgets while the tweets could be executed by the same cell phone? The device was also not sophisticatedly built and it added up the problems rather than solving this.

The $99 tweeting device with a $200 subscription plan proved a mega flop undermining the credibility of Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR).

Story continues

13. LG 3D TV (Annual Revenue: 4.6 billion USD)

Almost all manufacturers besides Samsung have stopped building 3D TVs by 2016. The idea was hastily adopted after the enormous success of Avatar. That was a fertile ground to push the 3D phenomena from cinema to home screens but reality emerged otherwise.

The restriction of wearing special glasses active shuttering different glasses for different brands high cost compatible paraphernalia such as 3D Blu-ray Disc player and satellite box dim display wreaked the collective havoc of LG 3D TV sets. Not every household likes 3D moderation. Soon after the LG 3D TV flop competitors Samsung and Panasonic also quickly took back their respective market shares assuming no potential in this genre. The mega failure proved that man likes liberty first and foremost. Also this was termed a significant product flop in history.

12. RJ Reynolds Smokeless Cigarette (Annual Revenue: 8.2 billion USD)

In 1988 RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company rolled out the out-of-box idea of smokeless cigarettes. The exact opposite to the anticipation the launch proved a mega failure. ""It tastes like burning charcoal"" New York Times 1988 edition reported. The smokers bemoaned disgusting smell bland flavor and too hot to hold traits. The design was also a bit too complicated for laypeople.

11. Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water (Annual Revenue: 9 billion USD)

Tap water was a typical villain in the late 1980s owing to the unclean tag. Coors assumed an opportune time to milk hefty fortunes by rolling out Rocking Mountain Sparkling Water in Original Cherry and Lemon-Lime flavors. Coors is now part of Molson Coors Beverage Co Class B (NYSE: TAP) after the 2005 merger between Molson and Coors.

Setting apart a clear win the company could not even garnish an iota of sales success like other clean water suppliers such as Nestle Arrowhead and Canadian. Consequently Molson Coors Beverage Co Class B (NYSE: TAP)'s Coors had to revert to its original beer-selling business quickly. The waters were high for Coors then. Consequently Coors Rocky became the participant in the 15 biggest product flops in history.

10.WOW Chips (Annual Revenue: 15.7 billion USD)

Frito-Lay introduced the fat-free olestra-cooked WOW chips back in 1998. Olestra was believed to be a dream diet at face value but the result came out as stomach cramps leading to diarrhea. Initially the product was branded as the best seller raking in the whopping sum of $347 million before totally wiping out by 2004.

The reasons for this rags to riches saga were mistaken dietary evaluation stale taste and FDA incursions. Had Frito-Lay read out the FDA guidelines before the inception of WOW chips the situation would not have been so embarrassing.

9. Qwikster (Annual Revenue: 25 billion USD)

Qwikster was a subsidiary of streaming giant Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) that stumbled headlong right after inception. Hence Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) had to take back the initiative. The primary purpose of Qwikster was to provide rental DVD services. The flurry of customer complaints quickly accompanied the service and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) denotified the idea of separate business entities for live streaming and DVD websites.

The flop of Qwikster had had the potential of gobbling up the parent company that fortunately did not happen. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) still remembers the scars.

8. New Coke (Annual Revenue: 37.2 billion USD)

On a fantastic evening in April 1985 Coca-Cola Consolidated Inc (NASDAQ: COKE) called the world press to huddle at Lincoln Center New York. Then CEO Roberto Goizueta announced New Coke's launch as ""The best has been made better"". Consumers could not agree with the boisterous claim and left Coca-Cola Consolidated Inc (NASDAQ: COKE) in tatters. Coca-Cola used fructose corn syrup as the base substance with stellar aspirations to give a knocking blow to PepsiCo. The launch also spent $4 million in R&D investment in the baggage.

In history Coca-Cola Consolidated Inc (NASDAQ: COKE) tried to mitigate the loss by labeling multiple names as Coca-Cola Classic and Coke II. The result was more or less the same. Resultantly Coca-Cola had to shrink by quarter to PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP)'s market sales and it came out to be in the list of 15 biggest product flops in history.

7. HP TouchPad (Annual Revenue: 56.6 billion USD)

HP Inc (NYSE: HPQ) TouchPad was a bumper launch cell phone that got canceled within a few weeks of 2011. The sudden cancellation took the industry watchers by storm leading to the dumping of entire inventory in clearance bin price. The mobile phone was launched to install a parallel rival against Apple. Thousands of journos initiated the trek to San Francisco for the much-hyped launch but all the hullabaloo proved a damp squib right after the launch.

The two anticipated reasons for the HP Inc (NYSE: HPQ) TouchPad cellphone were unavailability in the market right after the launch as HP Inc (NYSE: HPQ) does not have its retail stores. Secondly the unfamiliar webOS operating system. Overall this big flop has shaken the aspirations of HP Inc (NYSE: HPQ) to thrust into the mobile market.

6. Pepsi Crystal (Annual Revenue: 62.5 billion USD)

1990 is the decade known for confetti cake grunge vocal music weekend sitcoms and short-lived entry of PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) into the universe of crystal sodas. The shelf life of the mega launch of PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) Crystal was hardly a few years. Pepsi Crystal was branded as the panacea of digestive glitches but in essence it lacked the desired medicinal competency. The flavor side was also not very enchanting.

Consumer distress realpolitik shady competition a flavor of corporate sabotage wreaked collective havoc on PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) Crystal's launch and left the Pepsi Co. in shatters. The toll was so intense that the brand could not dare to launch another venture for long. The monetary loss might not be in a zillion but the ripples of credibility loss were overarching.

Why not try beer and these five other liquids?,"Free yourself from the tyranny of big milk.

All our lives we’ve been told to eat our cereal with milk like good little sheeple when all the time that combination has been nothing more than a sinister global conspiracy for cereal makers to boost their purported health benefits by piggy-backing on the high nutritional value of milk.

Granted cereal and milk is extremely delicious but there’s no reason it can’t also be a scam of royal proportions at the same time. Even in Japan on a bag of Corn Frosty (also known as Frosted Flakes or Frosties in other countries) Tony the Tiger can be seen proclaiming: “Make it more delicious with Milk! Magic with Milk!”

▼ F you Tony. I won’t do what you tell me!

In Japan Cereal Day falls on 29 May because the numbers 5-2-9 read as “ko-fu-ku” in Japanese loosely coincides with “corn flake” if you use your imagination really hard. So our reporter Seiji chose this day to become cereal’s new Independence Day celebrating our freedom from the drudgery of pouring milk on our cereal every day and instead opening a whole new universe of flavor combinations and possibilities with various other liquids.

Without further ado let’s take the red Fruit Loop and dive in…

Orange Drink

Orange juice is notorious for not playing we with others so Seiji decided on its more mild and saccharine cousin orange drink for his first test. Seiji figured since they were both sugary there shouldn’t be much conflict with this beverage and Corn Frosty.

He was right! The sweetness of the drink and sugary corn flakes melded well and the orangey aroma was quite pleasant too. If anything it was a little too sweet for Seiji and he though some pure orange juice might have been more balanced after all as opposed to this ten-percent juice one but that would have to wait for another Cereal Day.

Hojicha (Roasted Green Tea)

Having successfully warmed up Seiji tried something more adventurous with the classic Japanese beverage hojicha. He wasn’t quite sure how this would work out and at first glance the century-old drink didn’t seem like it would match with a cartoon tiger and his sugar-coated corn.

But Seiji was wrong! He could best describe this combination as “cool” in the style sense rather than temperature. Like the orange drink this combination also had an attractive aroma that really added to the experience more than milk. The flavors of the tea and cereal conflicted but balanced each other out for a refined taste. It was even better than the orange drink!

Soup Stock Seasoning

Dashi the name for a variety of Japanese soup stocks and sauces based on them is as widely used in Japan as Corn Frosty is around the world. So bringing them together was an exciting cross-cultural experiment but also risky since the fish and seaweed base of dashi wasn’t guaranteed to go with cereal.

Seiji took one bite and was overwhelmed by how amazingly delicious it was! It tasted like a full-bodied meal but the essence of the corn flakes was still firmly present in the mix. This sauce is usually used for noodles but with cereal there was a novel crispy texture that was really good too.

Monster Energy Drink

The flexibility of Corn Frosty was turning out to be much wider that Seiji had imagined but up until now he had been mixing with other items that have high compatibility. For his next test he wanted to find something that had a singular taste not often mixed with other flavors so he got some Monster energy drink.

It looked pretty gross to be honest and it made a fizzing sound because of Monster’s carbonation. Seiji imagined that sound was Monster infusing the Corn Frosty with pure energy as he went in for a spoonful.

It wasn’t bad! But it was very busy the crackling of the cereal and fizzing bubbles were going off left and right in his mouth against a background of intense sweetness. This seemed like an American taste to our reporter which would make sense since both were American products.

Low-Malt Beer

The previous test showed that Corn Frosty could hold up to carbonated drinks so Seiji decided to go one further and grabbed a can of beer for the next run. The wheat base of beer and corn base of cereal seemed like it should get along well.

That being said the bitterness of beer might not lend itself well to the cereal. Let’s see…

It worked! The bittersweet taste found the fight harmony and it turned into a kind of edible shandy. It truly was a solid bowl of Corn Frosty.

Extra Virgin Olive Oil

So far the experiment had exceeded Seiji’s wildest expectations so he decided to push the envelope for his final run and give his last bowl of cereal a generous coating of olive oil. Corn Frosty had proven itself to go well with a number of foods something which olive oil is also famous for but can they find common ground with each other?

Wouldn’t you know it? This worked too! The oil mixed with the sugar coating and created a kind of buttery sweet glaze and the viscosity of it kept the flakes crispier longer. It was a nice texture for those who like to keep their cereal crunchy yet lubricated at the same time.

Conclusion

Considering we didn’t expect this to work at all when starting out we are thrilled to report that cereal can go well with a number of other things beyond milk. It was a tough choice but if Seiji had to pick a winner from the bunch he felt he enjoyed the smooth elegance of hojicha and Corn Frosty the most.

Granted none of these substitutes match milk in terms of nutrition. In fact a couple of them would probably be downright hazardous to your health but this experiment has blown open the doors of preconception leading us into a world of limitless possibilities of liquids to enjoy your cereal with.

Happy Cereal Day!

The sun in this case is hot hot pricing which is warming the balance sheets of nearly every kind of trucking company.

In April spot rates — the price for a truck booked today as opposed to in advance — were the second highest ever recorded reported DAT the largest US load board where shippers and brokers list loads for carriers to grab. At the same time rates for precontracted trucks were at a 12-month high.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""Results continue to point to a positive freight environment with little to no signs of a slowdown"" Morgan Stanley analysts led by Ravi Shanker wrote in late May. But Shanker told Insider that doesn't mean that trouble will stay away forever. A fall will follow the prolonged high Shanker said. The question is when.

The trucking industry analysts said is slowly gliding toward a wave of bankruptcies and job losses that could resemble the ""apocalyptic"" conditions seen in 2019 when 640 trucking companies filed for bankruptcy in a six-month stretch. Cass Freight Index analysts said the growth in trucking rates is already slowing possibly portending that downturn.

The good news for trucking companies — and what makes the timing here tricky to gauge — is that recent structural changes to the industry status quo should keep fleets from building the capacity and finding the drivers that would create the kind of excess of supply needed for a rapid decline.

But it's only a matter of time and those with the sharpest eyes for industry indicators are the most likely to escape unscathed.

Falling in slow motion

Like many markets trucking runs in cycles. When the economy grows demand increases and prices go up since it takes time for trucking companies to see the demand and respond.

Truck drivers and fleets see the prices and jump into the market. At some point capacity exceeds demand and the bullwhip cracks. The market drops and truck drivers run out of work as some of the companies that hire them go bankrupt.

""It's every three to five years. It goes through this ridiculous cycle"" said Dean Croke the principal analyst at DAT.

The strange and unprecedented nature of the current sustained market high means the drop will be drawn out analysts said. Plus three major industry shifts make the coming 2022 or 2023 drop different from the last one in 2019 Shanker added.

First federal regulation that mandates the electronic tracking of driver hours which went into effect in 2017 took some capacity out of the market. Drivers could no longer get around the rules that restricted their driving time as they'd done when logs consisted of pen and paper. This factor was in place in 2019 but the other two were not.

Second increased scrutiny of driver drug use starting in January 2020 has taken tens of thousands of drivers off the road. And third insurance premiums for fleets rose for 12 years straight until 2019 the American Transportation Research Institute found. Insurance premiums landed among the top concerns for respondents to ATRI's 2020 industry survey for the first time since 2005 and anecdotal evidence pointed to massive premium hikes (ATRI is studying the issue now).

Related stories

Shanker said that ""if you're a small trucking company that has historically done 2% to 3% operating margin"" and your insurance line item ""is going up by 100% that will put you out of business immediately.""

All of these forces combined can keep new trucks from entering the market even if drivers are willing. (Signs that California's AB5 law may soon threaten the industry's contract labor aren't helping either.) Shanker predicted that capacity will stay short and that a true fall won't come until demand subsides.

Just a little bit of history repeating

The trucking industry may long remember 2018 and 2019. Factors such as a lapse in demand caused by tariffs and an industrial slowdown led trucking rates to take a nosedive triggering a slew of high- and low-profile bankruptcies.

The pain kept going into 2020 until the uncertainty of the early weeks of the pandemic yielded to a flood of e-commerce purchasing and a resurgence of imports. Truck-driver pay and trucking revenue have been exploding ever since.

Analysts don't expect imports and inventory restocking to cool significantly through the end of 2021 — maybe a few months into 2022 or even beyond. But they said some number of trucking companies will almost certainly go bankrupt as a result of that cooling.

""We never seem to learn from our mistakes"" Croke said. Carriers especially small ones don't plan very far ahead he said. ""They don't realize until it's too late.""

This coming pain may be harder to spot than the 2019 crash. Seasonal trends that tend to repeat every year are usually an essential part of the prediction game. For example business booms heading into the holidays and wanes in the new year. But since restocking is still in full force heading into the summer and has been since January those stalwart trends are out of whack. Retail stocks could top off earlier this year or keep flowing all the way to next spring.

""The crystal-ball part of this is very difficult given we've got very little seasonality"" Croke said.

Looking to the ports is likely the key to predicting the next cold shower since imports drive significant demand for trucking services. Even before the ships stop coming in Croke said truckers should look to the skies.

""Watch air cargo yields and volumes because the first thing to turn off is the most expensive form of freight"" he said. ""It's a long-term bellwether for global trade and right now you can't buy a seat on a cargo plane.""

There's plenty more sunshine to soak up for trucking companies Morgan Stanley said and the prolonged high is serving as a fascinating case study for even the most experienced industry vets. ""It is a very interesting time to be in the transportation space"" Shanker said.

In fact the coming cool-off may prove a strange comfort to industry players concerned that the stressful conditions of the past year are simply the new normal said Jett McCandless the CEO of freight-visibility platform Project44 and a former freight broker.

""Give it either two months or maybe two years and things will change"" McCandless said. ""It's always too much trucks or too much freight. That's just the way it works.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbW9jcmF0YW5kY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL3JkYzE1ODQwN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bruce Banker Bates Obituary - Rochester Democrat And Chronicle,"Let the family know you are thinking of them

According to the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) KTC's major shareholders as of Feb 24 were Krungthai Bank at 1.27 billion shares or 49.29% followed by Mr Mongkol with 269 million shares or 10.46% then Thai NVDR Co with 197 million shares or 7.65%.

The big lot transactions traded at a lower price than the previous day's closing price of 83 baht with transactions split between trades on the foreign board (KTC-F) worth 5.681 billion baht and the domestic board worth 2.541 billion.

According to Reuters Morgan Stanley facilitated the deal.

Morgan Stanley & Co International Plc was the fifth largest shareholder of KTC as of Feb 24 with 125 million shares or 4.87% of the company.

KTC chief financial officer Chutidej Chayuti said sellers of shares likely profited from the sale while new buyers must be confident in the future growth of the company.

The company provides unsecured and secured loans.

KTC has a customer base of more than 80000 and only 10000 customers applied for loan assistance under the central bank's measures worth roughly 1.2 billion baht.

The securities industry source said the big lot transactions came amid news KTC was interested in buying Citibank's retail portfolio worth 95 billion baht.

KTC reported a net profit for the first quarter this year of 1.63 billion baht compared with 1.64 billion for the same period last year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL21hcmtldHMuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0b2Nrcy90aWt0b2stZmVtaW5pc3QtZmluYW5jZS1nZW5kZXItZXF1YWxpdHktaW52ZXN0aW5nLWZpbnRvay1zdG9ja3Rvay0yMDIxLTUtMTAzMDQ3NjkwOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Young Female Investors Are Turning to TikTok 'Financial Feminism',"Some male TikTokers who are active on StockTok and FinTok still say finance is a man's realm.

But rising female Fintok stars like Jessica Spangler are proving them wrong and advocate for financial feminism.

They aim to empower women to take control and understand their finances and investing.

For some male TikTokers who are active on StockTok and FinTok the social media platform's financial niches markets and investing are still 'just for men'.

Age-old stereotypes of women not being able to understand finance or needing men to explain investing to them are constantly being retold. Male TikTokers often leave derogatory insulting comments under the videos of their female peers and appear to be getting more likes and engagement on their content.

Major banks and financial institutions have strived to reduce the gender imbalance in recent years. Goldman Sachs is aiming to have 40% female vice presidents by 2025 40% of JPMorgan's board members were female in 2020 39% of Morgan Stanley's global employees were women Christine Lagarde became the European Central Bank President two of the six Federal Reserve governors are women.

Yet fewer than 1% of global financial institutions have achieved gender equality according to the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum's 2021 Gender Balance Index. Only 15% of bitcoin and 12% of ethereum investors are women a survey by trading platform eToro found earlier this year. And on social media gender stereotypes are still all the rage.

""One of my first videos was talking about capital gains tax with short-term investing and just a whole bar of comments from guys: 'she has no idea what she's talking about none of this is true this is completely inaccurate' and I was literally sharing factual information. I mean it's not a debate it's not an opinion it's fact"" Jessica Spangler told Insider..

From simple comments like ""you're wrong"" to mockery and full-blown insults - it's all commonplace online. Scrolling through popular hashtags like #fintok #stocktok #investing or #finance creates a bleak image in terms of gender equality with the vast majority of content being put out by young men. The ""finance bro"" community is alive and well.

Spangler who has over 151000 followers on TikTok and goes by the handle @ecommjess says she is making 'financial feminism' a key part of her online brand.

""It is possible as a female to have a voice in finance to take control of your own financial situation and to kind of advocate and empower yourself through financial education"" Spangler said. ""It doesn't have to be you know an old guy in a suit that gives you all your information"" she said.

""I just want women to feel like can have their own financial future and be financially independent and that they don't need anybody else to you know handle their money for them"" Spangler said.

Spangler credits her commitment to financial feminism to her mother who inspired her to take control of her own money.

She didn't start her working life in the financial markets despite having taken college credit courses on business and finance and completing certificates and an associate's program in finance and business management in high school.

Spangler earned a doctorate degree in clinical pharmacy and began working in the field. After noticing how many women both at work where a number were also educated to doctorate level and in her personal life knew next to nothing about finance she decided that had to change - and started her financial social media accounts.

In her videos Jessica explains everything from 401ks and Roth IRAs to credit card rewards as well as concepts such as extended warranty and capital gains tax. But she also uses her platform to actively encourage women to invest and educate themselves about finance.

""Ladies we can make money in the stock market we will make money in the stock market we are smart and powerful and wealthy you're already a boss now be your own boss"" she says in one of her TikTok clips. Women celebrated her in the comments for the video.

In fact the vast majority of her followers are women she said. And they are more than keen to learn about finance - Spangler's comments are filled with young girls and women asking for advice and further clarification. Any topics that help them set themselves up for a secure financial future are especially popular she said. But she avoids giving direct financial advice and instead encourages them to educate themselves - a core part of her social media accounts' mission.

""I am trying to educate to provide people with the tools to assess information on their own and go out into the world and look into these things further so that hopefully they feel inspired to learn more and make their own decisions and mostly just feel empowered to make those decisions"" Spangler said."

Opens Second Location in Lindenhurst,"Sign up for our LI Press email newsletter to get news updates and local insights delivered straight to your inbox!

Northport-based Sand City Brewing Co. opened its second location on March 5 in Lindenhurst making it one of the few local breweries to expand to more than one site.

The 10000-square-foot new taproom and brewery on South Wellwood Avenue known as Sand City South became the third brewery to open in Lindenhurst after W.A. Meadwerks and 27A Brewing.

“The larger brewery will help us triple the amount of beer that Sand City is able to brew” says Bill Kiernan who cofounded Sand City with Kevin Sihler who adds: “We have the room now to set aside some of our beers to age and develop even more complex flavors.”

The brewhouse has a 20-barrel brewing system double the size of Sand City’s Northport location. Sihler who is Sand City’s head brewer said the new capacity will enable the brewery to increase canning and distribution of their current beers and to experiment with new styles.



Since its opening in fall 2015 Sand City has built a reputation for brewing some of Long Island’s best IPAs or India Pale Ale a heavily hopped beer style. Among these IPAs are single-hop beers like Mofosaic brewed with Mosaic hops and IPAs brewed with a combination of hops such as Classic Girl IPA dry hopped with Galaxy Mosaic and Citra hops.

Recent collaborations include Double IPAs brewed with upstate New York breweries such as Tin Barn Brewing from Chester and Equilibrium Brewery from Middletown. Finback Brewery from Brooklyn also collaborated recently on Double Something Infinity brewed with 11 different varieties of hops.

While the IPAs have received the most attention Sand City also brews a variety of other styles with recent beers such as A Fairly Simple Operation a Blueberry Golden Ale Roaring Noon Belgian-style Witbier with orange and coriander Red Sand American Amber Ale and Guava Freak a Belgian-style Tripel.

It took Sand City a couple of years to become a fixture in Northport’s lively downtown but after a few months it looks like Sand City South is already on its way to becoming a standout destination for Long Island’s South Shore.

Sand City South is located at 150 S. Wellwood Ave. in Lindenhurst. For more info visit sandcitybeer.com.

Doctor Doctor gimme the news

I got a bad case of lovin’ you

No pill’s gonna cure my ill

I got a bad case of lovin’ you

(From “Bad Case of Loving You (Doctor Doctor)” by Robert Palmer 1979)

We last visited the topic of factor diversification roughly a year ago. Most investors are seemingly very familiar with the visual of an asset class “performance quilt” which highlights the importance of asset class diversification.

But what we believe is equally as important as asset class diversification is risk factor diversification. One way to think about asset classes is that they are simply convenient and investable bundles of different risk factors. This is one explanation for why asset allocation doesn’t provide as much downside protection during market disruptions as many advisors and end clients expect.

Consider the simplistic example of U.S. large-cap stocks emerging market stocks and high-yield bonds. Three very different asset classes to be sure. But here is how they all performed during the worst of the global financial crisis.

Looks pretty similar. How about during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic last year?

Again very similar. Why is that? Because all three very different asset classes are highly exposed to the equity risk factor. Three different asset classes but with very similar factor exposures.

That’s why all WisdomTree Model Portfolios are diversified at both the asset class AND risk factor levels. We believe this helps deliver a better level of diversification and therefore more consistent performance over full market cycles.

Take a look at the factor dominance under two different environments. First let’s look at January 1 2015 until September 30 2019.

It seems to be all growth and momentum all the time. Value quality and dividends were in the caboose of the train.

Compare that to the past 12 months. It appears dividends and value have driven performance while growth and momentum have moved to the rear of the bus.

The point we’re trying to make is that it is just as difficult to predict factor rotation as it is asset class rotation. We’re not sure anyone predicted the massive factor rotation back toward small caps and value that occurred after the Pfizer vaccine announcement came out last November (though given that many WisdomTree products have a value or size “tilt” to them we certainly have enjoyed it). Value stocks in particular have roared back.

This is why we favor factor diversification as well as asset class diversification in all our Model Portfolios. We cannot guess factor rotation which can happen quickly so we build portfolios with diversified factor exposure.

Conclusions

All publicly available WisdomTree Model Portfolios have certain common characteristics:

They are global in nature; They are diversified at both the asset class and risk factor levels; They are ETF-focused to optimize fees and taxes; and We charge no strategist fee for them.

We are an open-architecture shop—that is all our Models include both WisdomTree and third-party products—for many reasons: (a) it’s simply the right thing to do (b) it’s what end clients assume and advisors expect and (c) it allows us to build more risk factor-diversified portfolios.

Asset class diversification is boring. We don’t mean it’s uninteresting just that the whole point is to use a golf expression to keep the ball in the middle of the fairway. The power of compounding is immense—as Albert Einstein is credited with suggesting “Compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe.”

What that means is that if you don’t lose as much in down markets you don’t need to gain as much in up markets to still come out ahead.

We firmly believe risk factor diversification is a means to that end.

Stellar earnings M&A speculation and the promise of post-lockdown demand have sent shares of companies like LVMH and Hermès International rocketing to all-time highs giving them multiples far richer than the Nasdaq 100. Their average price-to-earnings premium to Wall Street’s tech-heavy benchmark hit a record of 29 percent this month and is prompting some investors to question how much more steam their rally has.

Yes the sector still has a lot going for it. Consumers flush with cash after almost 18 months of on-again-off-again lockdowns may be ready to splurge on a Louis Vuitton bag or a Hermès scarf or a Chanel jacket. Also luxury’s ability to command top dollar for its wares remains intact and affluent Chinese clients still hanker after coveted European brand names. But that hasn’t stopped investors from being concerned about the fat multiples.

“These companies are Amazon-proof they know how to protect their brands” said Martyn Hole equity investment director at Capital Group which has an overweight position in luxury stocks. “The one thing we are worrying about is valuations.”

The MSCI Europe Apparel and Luxury Goods Index has risen 20 percent this year outperforming the MSCI Europe’s 12 percent gain and giving it a PE ratio of 35 times estimated 2021 earnings. The surge has taken the sector’s valuation premium relative to the broader market above 100 percent a historic high.

For Barclays Plc strategists that places luxury stocks in the very-expensive category with little room for upside in the second half of the year. UBS Group AG analyst Zuzanna Pusz said that while the earnings season that just ended was “great” people “ask themselves ‘what’s next?’”

The sector’s frenzy is not confined to stocks. This month Italian luxury fashion retailer Golden Goose drew enough interest to sell a 480 million-euro ($588 million) six-year junk bond with investors betting on its ability to sell high-end sneakers for around 400 euros.

Much attention is focused on the new drivers for luxury like stimulus checks in the U.S. the casual-wear that’s proving popular even as workers return to offices and the 700 billion euros in excess savings Europeans are estimated to have squirrelled away because of the pandemic waiting to be unleashed.

“We are in the days where the expensive gets even more expensive but for good reasons” said Michel Keusch a portfolio manager at Bellevue Asset Management AG. “In a scenario of reopening economies people want to treat themselves and buy things that will make them look good. We still see upside.”

Underestimated Risks

Still the stimulus won’t last forever and as economies reopen people will have a wide range of spending options from travel and restaurants to theatres and cinemas. Luxury goods may not be the top beneficiaries.

Two other elements that investors need to worry about are the overplaying of the M&A card and the political question mark over China demand luxury’s biggest growth engine.

German apparel maker Hugo Boss is trading at 43 times 2021 earnings amid M&A rumours which may or may not pan out. Troubled Italian shoemaker Tod’s SpA soared 66 percent as speculation swirled that LVMH may snap it up. Never mind that that Founder and Chairman Diego Della Valle poured cold water on hopes it will be sold anytime soon.

Burberry Group Plc tumbled after concerns rose about a sales hit from Chinese calls for a boycott of foreign brands over their positions on the use of cotton from the contentious Xinjiang region.

“Luxury sector risks could be underestimated” according to Francesca DiPasquantonio an analyst at Deutsche Bank.

‘Irrational’ Humans

Investors have plenty of other options. The analyst consensus sees little return for the MSCI Europe Luxury Goods Index over the next 12 months compared with a 19 percent upside for stocks on the MSCI Europe Retail Index particularly online retailers like Zalando SE.

Still for all the hand wringing on the sector’s rich valuations there are those who see newer growth engines like China’s emerging shopping hotspot of Hainan that’s “through the roof” said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Luca Solca. Also with Europe’s dominance in all things luxury from watches and jewels to clothes and super cars “long term the sector’s prospects are very good” said Capital Group’s Hole.

The pandemic showed investors the “fundamental qualities” of luxury companies including their strong pricing power and balance sheets said UBS’s Pusz.

“This sector is beautiful in the sense of being irrational” she said. “We don’t need these things we buy them because they make us feel a certain way. Covid-19 didn’t change human nature. If anything people are more willing to indulge themselves.”

Does Bitcoin’s Number Go Up (NGU) Technology Still Work?

If this question has entered your mind in the past several months read on to learn why the evidence for number go up (NGU) is stronger than ever. While the past two and a half months may have led some to fear uncertainty and doubt (FUD) Bitcoin is doing just fine and NGU isn’t going anywhere.

For anyone who has recently become aware of their bondage to the fiat financial system taking Bitcoin’s orange pill has undoubtedly been enlightening and exhilarating. However the legend of its past success may seem too good to be true based on the last two and a half months of consolidation especially for newly minted Bitcoiners. Add in the noise coming from nocoiners and altcoiners and you might find yourself starting to question your choice to go all in on bitcoin.

For example if you made your first bitcoin purchase on February 21 of this year you bought close to $58000 which was the current all time high. If you fast forward to today May 28 the price is just under $37000. Of course bitcoin’s price action has been anything but sideways since late February but with all the peaks and valleys it’s gone through it can be hard to believe in NGU when you haven’t lived through it yourself. Keeping a close eye on the day-to-daybitcoin pricemovement can be maddening when it isn’t taking off like all those rocketship emojis on Twitter indicate it should.

For those of us who could use a friendly reminder here are five reasons to believe in Bitcoin NGU technology:

Institutional investment invasion. Institutional investors are arriving to the space like never before and huge deals are getting done on a daily basis. This week alone saw a major development that will make bitcoin accessible to over 300 million bank accounts in the U.S. alone thanks to a partnership between New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) and Fintech firm FIS. Ripe on-chain metrics: On-chain data indicate that the consolidation phase is ending soon and the next leg up of the bull market is about to kick off. Check out William Clemente III’s appearance on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast to understand why. Bitcoin annual returns. The yearly rate of return for bitcoin is absolutely insane and is unmatched by any asset in the history of markets. If you ever need a little inspiration to stack more sats and HODL for the long-haul take a look at this bottom line table. Professional athletes take the lead. Pro athletes are incredibly influential to people of all ages and walks of life so when an NFL player announces that he will convert his entire 2021 salary to bitcoin it sends a message that’s impossible to ignore. See why pro athletes are starting to demand their pay in bitcoin in this article. Approaching avalanche of access. There are currently eight active applications for Bitcoin ETFs that are awaiting approval. And with an U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman who understands Bitcoin more than any previous chair his expected approval this year would open the floodgates to capital that has thus far been unable to gain exposure to BTC.

Overall there are countless reasons to be bullish about Bitcoin and its patented NGU technology. Hold onto the ones above and keep educating yourself on the reasons for the bright future that lies ahead for Bitcoiners.

That's a bad idea.,"Netflix co-CEOs Reed Hastings left and Ted Sarandos right.

Netflix is reportedly fishing around for a major video game business executive to hire.

The company intends to expand its gaming efforts – to break into the lucrative video game industry.

That initiative is likely to fail given the history of tech and entertainment companies in gaming.

Visit the Business section of Insider for more stories.

With over 200 million paid subscribers worldwide Netflix is an absolute behemoth.

The streaming entertainment giant has successfully transitioned from a scrappy startup paying to license its content to a major player in Hollywood splashing out tens of millions of dollars on its own productions.

So what's next for Netflix? The answer to that question at least in part appears to be video games.

Netflix is fishing around for a gaming executive to help it expand out its gaming initiative according to a recent report in The Information. While the company has acknowledged an interest in interactive entertainment it has yet to decide what this will mean in practice. Licensing content from existing game makers? Making its own games? And how will you actually play those games?

While we still don't know much about Netflix's plans one thing is clear right now: Netflix getting involved in gaming is almost certain to fail.

""I do think they will try and do think they will fail"" Wedbush managing director Michael Pachter told Insider. ""It's hard to make games.""

""Black Mirror: Bandersnatch"" is an ""interactive movie"" on Netflix that is more choose-your-own-adventure than video game.

Netflix



Indeed the video game industry is a very risky business and even entrenched studios with top-tier talent and years of experience regularly go under. ""We have the failures of THQ Midway Acclaim 3DO BAM Eidos Atari Infogrames Interplay and probably a few others to illustrate how hard it is"" Pachter said. ""I don't see how Netflix could possibly think it can develop and sell games.""

Joost van Dreunen author of ""One Up: Creativity Competition and the Global Business of Video Games"" echoed Pachter's skepticism.

""Big tech sucks at games"" he told Insider.

He pointed to Google's Stadia Amazon's Luna and Facebook's scattershot gaming efforts across the last decade as prime examples of how major tech companies routinely fail at gaming initiatives.

Google and Amazon and Facebook have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into gaming across the last decade yet none are major players in the video game market. ""They look at it in a way that distribution goes before the content"" Van Dreunen said ""and that's the wrong way around.""

Instead of creating video games and building beloved brands they've largely focused on the mechanics of how you buy and access those games: Google's Stadia platform a Netflix-like video game streaming service is a prime example.







Less than two years after Google announced a major game development initiative led by ""Assassin's Creed"" creator Jade Raymond and less than one year after outright buying a video game studio the company folded those efforts this past February.

What's Google focusing on for its big gaming service rather than making games for it?

An ""increased focus on using our technology platform for industry partners"" Google Stadia Vice President Phil Harrison said in a blog post – a pretty huge step back from the splashy announcement of Stadia back in 2019 which promised a new digital service that would compete against the likes of Nintendo Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox.

Google VP Phil Harrison speaks during a Google keynote address announcing Google Stadia at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco March 2019.

For Netflix which has the benefit of owning a beloved intellectual property like ""Stranger Things"" that could lend itself to games another problem exists.

""Building games from owned IP is also super hard"" Pachter said. ""Disney has failed at least three times trying to do so and its IP is much stronger than Netflix.""

In recent years Disney's biggest properties – from Marvel characters to the ""Star Wars"" franchise – have found success in gaming by Disney largely handing over creative control to major video game companies.

Examples include 2018's ""Marvel's Spider-Man"" and 2019's ""Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order."" The former a PlayStation 4 exclusive game made by Insomniac Games sold over 20 million copies. The latter a multiplatform ""Star Wars"" game with original characters and story sold over 10 million copies.

At approximately $60 apiece each game has grossed well over $1 billion in sales.

2018's ""Marvel's Spider-Man"" for the PlayStation 4.

Netflix could follow a similar model and potentially find success.

The company could build a wildly successful game streaming service that seamlessly leverages its existing streaming service. It could spend years and hundreds of millions of dollars building its IP into major game franchises.

Or it could buy its way in splashing out billions of dollars on a major game publisher like EA or Ubisoft – akin to Amazon's recent purchase of MGM Studios but for gaming. That would require a major long-term institutional buy-in from Netflix in addition to major financial investments.

""You need to have the stomach"" Van Dreunen said. ""Like when you look at Google and Amazon – they just don't have internally the numbers or the understanding of the space to say 'Yeah you know what we should do? Spend $10 billion to really break in.'""

For its part Netflix hasn't detailed its gaming plans just yet – but the company is acknowledging the reported interest in a larger gaming investment in the future.

""Our members value the variety and quality of our content"" the company said in a statement. ""Members also enjoy engaging more directly with stories they love – through interactive shows like 'Bandersnatch' and 'You v. Wild' or games based on 'Stranger Things' 'La Casa de Papel' and 'To All the Boys.' So we're excited to do more with interactive entertainment.""

The streaming platform is developing a series about Duchess Elisabeth of Bavaria an Austrian empress whose life involved a series of escalating tragedies before finally culminating in an assassination.

Elisabeth known as Sissi was Empress of Austria beginning in 1854 when she married Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary at the age of 16. But despite this lofty title her life was largely dark and difficult—she lost her first child at a young age and then lost her only son Rudolf in what was suspected to be a murder-suicide on his part (his body was found next to that of his lover). Less than ten years later her sister Duchess Sophie also perished in a fire. After all of this loss Elisabeth's own life also ended at a young age when she was assassinated by an Italian anarchist in 1898.

Titled The Empress the six-part series will star German actress Devrim Lingnau. Per The Daily Mail the series won't all be doom and gloom—it'll also explore Elisabeth's infamous beauty and fitness regime which led her to be dubbed ""the loveliest woman in Europe."" She was reportedly an exercise fanatic performing 20 pull-ups every morning and used a series of unusual beauty treatments including bathing in goats' milk putting veal on her face and washing her hair in eggs and cognac.

So while the series isn't likely to be a cheerful watch you may pick up a few unorthodox beauty tips along the way. The Empress is expected to launch in spring of 2022."

LOS ANGELES – During a recent visit to Southern California the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers South Pacific Division commander celebrated the completion of one of the Los Angeles District’s flood-risk management projects in Corona California.

In addition to speaking at a ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the completion of the BNSF Bridge Pier Protection Project Brig. Gen. Paul Owen toured four other projects in the LA District’s footprint May 26 to 27 including the LA River Ecosystem Restoration Project in collaboration with the City of Los Angeles; Whittier Narrows Dam in Montebello; the Santa Ana River Mainstem project which includes Prado Dam in Corona; and Santiago Creek in Orange County. All projects are being completed by the Corps’ LA District in coordination with local state and federal partners.

Owen was accompanied by LA District Commander Col. Julie Balten and LA District Deputy Engineer David Van Dorpe.

“This was a great trip for me to work with and learn more about what the Los Angeles District is doing on several projects” Owen said. “We went everywhere – from Prado (Dam) to Whittier (Narrows Dam) to Santiago Creek to the BNSF Bridge Pier Protection Project.”

The whirlwind of visits saw the senior leaders driving long distances May 26 through heavily congested freeways under a sunny Southern California sky. Before heading to his first project site visit at Whittier Narrows Dam Owen received an update about the Prado Basin Ecosystem Restoration Project from Balten and Paul Underwood Santa Ana River Mainstem Mega Project Branch chief at the LA District’s headquarters building in downtown Los Angeles. After leaving downtown Owen and LA District senior leaders visited the Corps’ Base Yard in South El Monte to receive a briefing about the Whittier Narrows Dam Safety Modification project from Justin Gay Mega Projects Division chief and others working on the project before heading to the dam.



WHITTIER NARROWS DAM SAFETY MODIFICATION PROJECT

Whittier Narrows Dam was constructed in 1957 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a flood-risk management project and is located 11 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. The dam protects more than 1.2 million people.

Following Hurricane Katrina the Corps dramatically overhauled its process for prioritizing dam and levee evaluations and modifications to better account for potential impacts to the population protected by the structures. The Whittier Narrows Dam Safety Modification Study was subsequently initiated to evaluate the risk to the population which extends from Pico Rivera to Long Beach.

In May 2016 the Corps placed Whittier Narrows Dam in the agency’s highest risk category “very high urgency” when it became clear three potential failure modes threatened the downstream population. The three failure modes are premature opening of the San Gabriel River Spillway gates erosion resulting from water piping through the foundation of the earthen dam and overtopping during an extreme flood. While the first would result in downstream flooding as the levees were overtopped the latter two could result in a catastrophic failure of the dam.

In 2019 the Corps awarded a $5-million contract to Metro Builders of California to complete construction on the spillway gates which were completed in December 2020.

The Whittier Narrows Dam Safety Modification Study was completed in June 2019 and went into the design phase in October 2019. Utility contracts are anticipated to be awarded in late summer 2021 and construction contracts for the dam modification are anticipated to be awarded in 2022.

The modifications will prevent the earthen dam from breach and include placing concrete on the crest and downstream slope of the embankment and improving the seepage control system with features like trench drains and graded filter/drainage blankets.



LA RIVER ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION PROJECT

On May 27 Owen and others with the LA District took in a view overlooking the LA River from Elysium Park to discuss the Los Angeles Ecosystem Restoration Project before meeting with LA city officials in Taylor Yard next to the river. Balten along with Priyanka Wadhawan LA District project manager and Erica Kemp-Weitzman section chief of the LA District’s Hydrology and GIS section updated the general about the project.

The LA River Ecosystem Restoration Project is a joint effort with the City of Los Angeles to restore about 11 miles of the river from Griffith Park to downtown Los Angeles while also maintaining existing levels of flood-risk management. Restoration measures include the creation and reestablishment of historic riparian strand and freshwater marsh habitat to support increased populations of wildlife and enhance habitat connectivity within the project area as well as to provide opportunities for connectivity to ecological zones such as the Santa Monica Mountains Verdugo Hills Elysian Hills and San Gabriel Mountains among others.

It is one of three public-private partnerships or P3 pilot projects with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers – an alternative method to develop approaches to deliver projects faster and with greater flexibility. The concept of the P3 project aims at using a split-delivery approach in which the city takes on more responsibilities that will accelerate project completion enhance efficiency and reduce unnecessary redundancies in project delivery to complete a majority of the project benefits by 2028 lower total project costs and maximize the federal return on investment.

Public-private partnerships are a tool that can accelerate delivery by providing significant upfront funding and by leveraging appropriations while optimizing local participation and promoting risk sharing in project delivery.



SANTA ANA RIVER MAINSTEM PROJECT

The entourage then traveled to the City of Corona where Owen spoke at a ribbon-cutting to celebrate the completion of the BNSF Bridge Pier Protection Project along the Santa Ana River in Corona California. The project was a collaborated effort with the Corps’ LA District and the tri-counties of Riverside Orange and San Bernardino.

The purpose of the project is to minimize risk to the railroad bridge in flood conditions and during increased water releases from Prado Dam resulting from periods of heavy rainfall.

The completion of the more than $100-million bridge pier protection feature is part of the $2.8-billion Santa Ana River Mainstem Project which is a fully integrated flood-risk management system for the Riverside Orange and San Bernardino counties several major freeways the rail system itself and an array of businesses and infrastructure in the basin.

No protection features were in place at the bridge piers or along the riverbank at the bridge prior to the project; the BNSF railroad bridge is now fully protected from water releases up to 30000 cubic feet per second downstream of Prado Dam.

Following the ceremony the general toured the entire Santa Ana River Mainstem Project as well as Santiago Creek another site managed by the Corps in Orange County. There the general was briefed by Balten and Damien Lariviere LA District project manager about the creek and the entire overall project.

Before departing Los Angeles to return to San Francisco Owen took a moment to recognize Lariviere and another Corps employee with coins for their dedication to duty.

“This was a fully packed two days of activity” Owen said. “I got a really good perspective of all of the complexities that the Los Angeles District is working on.”

LOS ANGELES – During a recent visit to Southern California the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers South Pacific Division commander celebrated the completion of one of the Los Angeles District’s flood-risk management projects in Corona California.

In addition to speaking at a ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the completion of the BNSF Bridge Pier Protection Project Brig. Gen. Paul Owen toured four other projects in the LA District’s footprint May 26 to 27 including the LA River Ecosystem Restoration Project in collaboration with the City of Los Angeles; Whittier Narrows Dam in Montebello; the Santa Ana River Mainstem project which includes Prado Dam in Corona; and Santiago Creek in Orange County. All projects are being completed by the Corps’ LA District in coordination with local state and federal partners.

Owen was accompanied by LA District Commander Col. Julie Balten and LA District Deputy Engineer David Van Dorpe.

“This was a great trip for me to work with and learn more about what the Los Angeles District is doing on several projects” Owen said. “We went everywhere – from Prado (Dam) to Whittier (Narrows Dam) to Santiago Creek to the BNSF Bridge Pier Protection Project.”

The whirlwind of visits saw the senior leaders driving long distances May 26 through heavily congested freeways under a sunny Southern California sky. Before heading to his first project site visit at Whittier Narrows Dam Owen received an update about the Prado Basin Ecosystem Restoration Project from Balten and Paul Underwood Santa Ana River Mainstem Mega Project Branch chief at the LA District’s headquarters building in downtown Los Angeles. After leaving downtown Owen and LA District senior leaders visited the Corps’ Base Yard in South El Monte to receive a briefing about the Whittier Narrows Dam Safety Modification project from Justin Gay Mega Projects Division chief and others working on the project before heading to the dam.



WHITTIER NARROWS DAM SAFETY MODIFICATION PROJECT

Whittier Narrows Dam was constructed in 1957 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a flood-risk management project and is located 11 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. The dam protects more than 1.2 million people.

Following Hurricane Katrina the Corps dramatically overhauled its process for prioritizing dam and levee evaluations and modifications to better account for potential impacts to the population protected by the structures. The Whittier Narrows Dam Safety Modification Study was subsequently initiated to evaluate the risk to the population which extends from Pico Rivera to Long Beach.

In May 2016 the Corps placed Whittier Narrows Dam in the agency’s highest risk category “very high urgency” when it became clear three potential failure modes threatened the downstream population. The three failure modes are premature opening of the San Gabriel River Spillway gates erosion resulting from water piping through the foundation of the earthen dam and overtopping during an extreme flood. While the first would result in downstream flooding as the levees were overtopped the latter two could result in a catastrophic failure of the dam.

In 2019 the Corps awarded a $5-million contract to Metro Builders of California to complete construction on the spillway gates which were completed in December 2020.

The Whittier Narrows Dam Safety Modification Study was completed in June 2019 and went into the design phase in October 2019. Utility contracts are anticipated to be awarded in late summer 2021 and construction contracts for the dam modification are anticipated to be awarded in 2022.

The modifications will prevent the earthen dam from breach and include placing concrete on the crest and downstream slope of the embankment and improving the seepage control system with features like trench drains and graded filter/drainage blankets.



LA RIVER ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION PROJECT

On May 27 Owen and others with the LA District took in a view overlooking the LA River from Elysium Park to discuss the Los Angeles Ecosystem Restoration Project before meeting with LA city officials in Taylor Yard next to the river. Balten along with Priyanka Wadhawan LA District project manager and Erica Kemp-Weitzman section chief of the LA District’s Hydrology and GIS section updated the general about the project.

The LA River Ecosystem Restoration Project is a joint effort with the City of Los Angeles to restore about 11 miles of the river from Griffith Park to downtown Los Angeles while also maintaining existing levels of flood-risk management. Restoration measures include the creation and reestablishment of historic riparian strand and freshwater marsh habitat to support increased populations of wildlife and enhance habitat connectivity within the project area as well as to provide opportunities for connectivity to ecological zones such as the Santa Monica Mountains Verdugo Hills Elysian Hills and San Gabriel Mountains among others.

It is one of three public-private partnerships or P3 pilot projects with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers – an alternative method to develop approaches to deliver projects faster and with greater flexibility. The concept of the P3 project aims at using a split-delivery approach in which the city takes on more responsibilities that will accelerate project completion enhance efficiency and reduce unnecessary redundancies in project delivery to complete a majority of the project benefits by 2028 lower total project costs and maximize the federal return on investment.

Public-private partnerships are a tool that can accelerate delivery by providing significant upfront funding and by leveraging appropriations while optimizing local participation and promoting risk sharing in project delivery.



SANTA ANA RIVER MAINSTEM PROJECT

The entourage then traveled to the City of Corona where Owen spoke at a ribbon-cutting to celebrate the completion of the BNSF Bridge Pier Protection Project along the Santa Ana River in Corona California. The project was a collaborated effort with the Corps’ LA District and the tri-counties of Riverside Orange and San Bernardino.

The purpose of the project is to minimize risk to the railroad bridge in flood conditions and during increased water releases from Prado Dam resulting from periods of heavy rainfall.

The completion of the more than $100-million bridge pier protection feature is part of the $2.8-billion Santa Ana River Mainstem Project which is a fully integrated flood-risk management system for the Riverside Orange and San Bernardino counties several major freeways the rail system itself and an array of businesses and infrastructure in the basin.

No protection features were in place at the bridge piers or along the riverbank at the bridge prior to the project; the BNSF railroad bridge is now fully protected from water releases up to 30000 cubic feet per second downstream of Prado Dam.

Following the ceremony the general toured the entire Santa Ana River Mainstem Project as well as Santiago Creek another site managed by the Corps in Orange County. There the general was briefed by Balten and Damien Lariviere LA District project manager about the creek and the entire overall project.

Before departing Los Angeles to return to San Francisco Owen took a moment to recognize Lariviere and another Corps employee with coins for their dedication to duty.

“This was a fully packed two days of activity” Owen said. “I got a really good perspective of all of the complexities that the Los Angeles District is working on.”

His home added onto many times over sits at the edge of 1000 acres where he raises cattle and bales hay.

From his driveway he has a more than 180-degree view of neighbors’ land and native prairie grass. But by next year he expects the horizon to be dominated by commercial wind turbines some as close as 4000 feet.

He and his neighbors will be in the shadow of the 300-megawatt Irish Creek Wind Farm which is set to begin operation late this year. Neighbors who didn’t sell land to the wind farm developer NextEra Energy Resources are dreading the day the towering structures appear erupting from their treasured horizon.

Right now Cline’s home points east. He can see for miles.

“I like looking at the good clean hills” Cline said. “Native grass and the native Flint Hills is a site of beauty.”

NextEra headquartered in Florida is the world’s largest renewable energy generator. It already has half a dozen wind farms in Kansas primarily in the south central and southwestern parts of the state. It also has one wind farm in Missouri.

Kansas was early to the wind rush dotting the state with turbines that in 2019 beat coal for the first time in generating the largest chunk of the state’s electricity. In 2020 43% of the state’s generation came from wind according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

By comparison 70% of Missouri’s generation comes from coal. Only 9% comes from all its renewable sources — wind hydropower biomass and solar — combined.

Last year NextEra added 120 turbines in neighboring Nemaha County Kansas surrounding Centralia and Corning.

That neighboring wind farm which began operations in 2020 was a warning to some residents of Marshall County who say the looming turbines blinking red lights engine humming and whooshing sounds when the blades rotate past the turbine’s tower will diminish their quality of life.

In Marshall County the company plans up to 100 turbines. Developers say the wind farm will bring 300 construction jobs and 12-15 permanent jobs to the community along with $50 million in payments to landowners who have turbines on their property and $40 million in county property taxes over the next 30 years.

In Kansas the company is helping “fuel the state’s economic growth and quality of life and moving our country toward energy independence” NexEra says on its website. It did not respond to a request for comment.

“The Irish Creek Wind project has received tremendous support in Marshall County” Kennedy Conlan a company spokesperson said in an email. “The project is providing significant benefits for the local community including approximately $40 million in property tax revenue over the life of the project. That’s funding for local school districts first responders and other essential services in the community.”

Residents like Cline in Marshall County and parts of Kansas were behind a push earlier this year to regulate wind development at the state level in Kansas. Right now it’s up to counties and cities to decide how close to residents’ homes and property lines developers can build turbines. In Marshall County where there are no zoning rules the county’s commission was left to negotiate those setbacks density and other agreements with NextEra.

According to the county’s development agreement with NextEra turbines can’t exceed 500 feet in height. They must be at least a mile from city limits and 1.1 times their height — 550 feet — from the property line of any non-participating landowner.

The proposed changes to state regulations didn’t make it far. A Senate committee heard days of testimony but didn’t take a vote. But some counties in both Kansas and Missouri have moved to restrict or ban wind development.

Proponents of Senate Bill 279 say it is necessary to protect the rights of rural landowners who aren’t part of the project but will be affected by their neighbors’ decisions.

“You’re asking people who live in a community … to put up with the change of their lifestyle so a company can make money” said Gayla Randel a Marshall County resident.

Opponents of the bill including energy industry representatives and environmentalists say it would virtually halt wind development in Kansas. They point out that participating landowners have the right to do business on their own ground.

Kimberly Gencur Svaty a lobbyist representing the Kansas Advanced Power Alliance said she thought the wind energy industry did a good job trying to ensure that both participating and non-participating landowners are treated fairly.

“If view is the issue there are no protections that will be put in place for any form of development if you just don’t want to look at it” she said.

County pushback

Marshall County residents aren’t alone in their concerns about commercial wind.

An effort to block a wind farm in Reno County is currently tied up in court. Most of the Flint Hills is protected under a moratorium on wind development. McPherson County has issued a ban on wind development.

County Commission Chairman Keith Becker said residents in his county were worried about the noise and shadows from the turbines. He said the developers were already leasing ground but he heard an outcry from the community.

“The people have spoken and I just felt like … it was best that we would not have something like that in our county” Becker said.

Gencur Svaty said a handful of counties in eastern Kansas particularly those that are more densely populated had adopted more stringent regulations or issued a moratorium on wind development. But she said she didn’t see a trend toward more restrictions.

“In Kansas we’ve built four new projects this year. We’ve repowered one. And there’s one project that there’s been some anxiety about” Gencur Svaty said referencing the Marshall County project.

Across the state line in Missouri Boone County is considering regulations renewable energy proponents say would make building a wind farm impossible.

The county’s planning and zoning commission has been taking public comment on regulations including a requirement that wind turbines be no more than 400 feet tall. Tim Optiz general counsel for Renew Missouri which advocates for clean energy said that would make development impossible because most modern turbines are far taller.

The proposed regulations also require turbines be placed at least 1750 feet from roads and property lines.

“My view is it would foreclose any potential development in Boone county” Optiz said. “It would probably foreclose most development in counties throughout the state just given the inclusion of setbacks from public roads and the turbine heights.”

Optiz said he hadn’t seen much pushback statewide in Missouri. The efforts to regulate in Boone have been recent but the state has added huge amounts of wind power in recent years.

“It’s disappointing that people will be convinced by nonsense out there and I think it comes down to they’ve seen their landscape look a certain way and they don’t want it to change” Optiz said.

Rights and regulations

Driving through rural Marshall County there are stretches without any buildings at all.

Standing in Cline’s driveway off a dirt road southwest of Frankfort there’s hardly a sound besides birds chirping and wind blowing the prairie grass.

Residents who oppose Irish Creek say the stillness is why they chose to live in rural Marshall County. They’re worried about what they’ve seen in neighboring Nemaha County where turbines dominate the landscape within minutes of the county line.

From Greg Allen’s home in Nemaha County he can hear the constant humming of the wind turbine and the whoosh each time a blade passes the top of the tower. The closest turbine to his house is about 3500 feet.

“My standing joke is I don’t have to put Christmas lights up anymore” he said.

The disturbance is a common complaint among rural residents who live close to wind farms who worry about adverse health effects from the noise and blinking lights.

NextEra says properly sited wind turbines do not pose a threat to human or animal health.

The Marshall County residents proposed the Kansas Legislature enact statewide rules for wind farms including a required 1-mile setback from the property lines of any non-participating landowners and a 1.5-mile setback from homes.

Only one turbine could be built per square mile. Developers would have to notify every landowner in the wind farm footprint of their plans and provide sound studies to show what steps they were taking to mitigate the effects on residents.

Developers would be required to use lighting systems that are activated when radar detects a plane in the airspace rather than have lights blinking constantly.

Proponents of the legislation say non-participating landowners aren’t given a voice in decisions about wind farms that will affect their surroundings and potentially their property values.

But opponents say that would infringe on the property rights of landowners who choose to lease their ground for wind turbines.

Wind industry representatives and environmentalists said the policy was unworkable.

Alan Claus Anderson vice chairman of the energy practice group at Polsinelli in Kansas City Missouri said in testimony to a Kansas Senate committee that the bill is “not attempting to impose reasonable requirements on the siting of wind turbines.”

“It would be completely disingenuous to talk about this bill as anything other than the end of the renewable energy industry in our state a usurpation of the rights of local communities schools Kansas businesses industry employees and a complete taking of a natural resource from property owners” Anderson said.

Opponents said the across-the-board approach wasn’t right when other counties in Kansas have more enthusiastically embraced wind development. Population density varies among Kansas counties and those counties should have the right to decide what regulations are right for them.

Residents of Marshall County including Carol Hull viewed it as a lifeline to help avoid the changing landscape.

“The peace and quiet of the neighborhood is going to be gone” Hull said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Nike says investigation was inconclusive

In its statement on the incident this week following a report into the investigation by The Wall Street Journal Nike said that while it viewed the allegations about the incident in 2016 as ""credible"" it believed the independent investigation it commissioned was inconclusive.

“No single set of facts emerged that would enable us to speak substantively on the matter. It would be inappropriate for Nike to make an accusatory statement without being able to provide supporting facts” the statement said.

Neymar's spokeswoman said the athlete would vigorously defend himself if any claim is presented describing the allegations as baseless and adding that the endorsement deal ended for commercial reasons.

Members-only



Nick DePaula has worked as the creative director of Nice Kicks served as the chief editor of Sole Collector Magazine and is currently ESPN‘s foremost authority on basketball sneakers. He’s seen pretty much every sneaker imaginable over his decade-plus in the game but even after all those years and all those shoes there’s one that still stands out to him: Nike‘s Zoom Hyperflight.

Growing up in Sacramento California as an avid Sacramento Kings fan on a strict $40-$50 sneaker budget DePaula gravitated towards shoes like Jason Kidd‘s Air Zoom Flight 95 and later the Zoom Hyperflight — a cult favorite Nike Basketball shoe worn by Jason Williams his favorite player. Those years proved to be formative for a young DePaula who took his love for hoops footwear and his desire to acquire the “best” sneakers and turned it into a career.

Now in the latest installment of HYPEBEAST‘s Sole Mates series Nick DePaula discusses his sneaker origin story some of his favorite collaborations he’s worked on where he thinks hoop shoes from Nike adidas and others are headed in the future and his new The Sneaker Game show with Boardroom.

HYPEBEAST: What got you into sneakers?

Nick DePaula: My love of sneakers grew from playing basketball as a kid. I was really inspired by guys like Penny Hardaway Jason Kidd Jason Williams and Kevin Garnett. Naturally you gravitate to looking at what they’re wearing on the court like the rubber band KG wore on his wrist Jason Kidd’s armband and of course everyone’s sneakers. I didn’t have all the “best” sneakers growing up and always joke with my mom that my whole obsession with sneakers might have ended if she’d bought me a pair of Air Penny 2s as a 6th grader [laughs]. I had a $40 shoe budget in middle school and a $50 shoe budget in high school so I had to get real resourceful whether that was combing through Marshalls and Ross trying to find stuff or digging into Eastbay and Final Score catalogues. I loved that hunt.

So that firm budget made you desire those “really good” sneakers more than you would’ve if you could have had whatever kind of shoe you wanted?

Oh of course. The Air Zoom Flight 95 was the first shoe that really did it for me. The second I saw that black colorway with the carbon fiber I knew there was nothing like it out there. Jason Kidd was playing for the Dallas Mavericks at the time and wearing them every game. I wanted them more than anything but they were $110 more than twice my budget. Instead I wound up getting the Air Thrill Flight [a takedown model of the Air Zoom Flight 95] at JCPenny for $58 and had to chip in $18 from my childhood chores. That Thrill Flight was honestly a really solid shoe but the Air Zoom Flight 95 was this aspirational thing for me that I always wanted to get my hands on. Once I got to college I got a debit card just to link it to my eBay account and buy a pair of Zoom Flights. I think that was my first real step down the path of collecting.

Let’s talk about another one of your favorites: the Zoom Hyperflight. You grew up in Sacramento — I’m assuming that you were a big Kings fan and introduced to the shoe by Jason Williams?

Absolutely. The Kings were my favorite team. Growing up in Sacramento that was our only pro sports team. Purple is my favorite color as well and although sneakers dropping in really wild colors is commonplace nowadays it wasn’t as much so when the Hyperflight debuted back in 2001. J-Will played in a purple pair a silver pair and an all black pair but my high school basketball uniforms were red. I was working as a lifeguard in the summer at the time and saved up to buy a red pair. It was the first shoe I ever bought with my own money and at $125 it was a lot back then. I pre-ordered them off Eastbay like 3-4 months in advance thinking that they were going to sell out. When I showed up to practice with them my teammates roasted me — they called me “Dorothy” like the Wizard of Oz [laughs].

From a design standpoint it was an interesting time because there were a lot of really flashy shoes around the turn of the century. The Hyperflight was so sleek so futuristic with that glossy upper and those thin black lines. Of course it’s not actually that great of a basketball shoe because it’s kind of flimsy and creases like crazy — but I love the design so much that I own 12 13 14 pairs now and the original release too.

It’s interesting that a shoe can look so unique but be so lacking in the performance department. I recall reading that Jason Williams actually changed out of the Hyperflight in the 2001 playoffs because it wasn’t holding up the way he wanted it to.

That was always funny to me too especially because shoes for guys like Michael Jordan and Penny Hardaway looked great and played great as well. The Hyperflight really didn’t. J-Will switched into the Air Force Carbide in the playoffs and Terrell Brandon had a pretty bad injury while wearing a pair. Damon Stoudamire and Derek Fisher had PEs as well and they’d switch in and out of them.

“Although Tinker Hatfield is Nike’s most groundbreaking designer I think Eric Avar is Nike’s ‘best’ designer.”

With that being said where do you think the Hyperflight stacks up in Eric Avar’s greater design catalogue?

That’s a tough question because although Tinker Hatfield is Nike’s most groundbreaking designer I think Eric Avar is Nike’s “best” designer. Between the Foamposite line the Flightposite line all his signature work with Kobe Bryant’s shoes he’s got a lot of hits. I’d probably put the Hyperflight in the top 10 of his catalogue but it’s a hard choice because he’s made so much great stuff over so many decades.

After high school and college you’re working at Sole Collector and Nice Kicks doing a lot of collaborative projects. I’m sure working on those collaborations changed your view on footwear — did it make you appreciate the Hyperflight more?

Yeah man. Our projects were usually rooted in a player or technology that we were really excited about and wanted to do a lot of storytelling around. One of those shoes was the Zoom Flight Club which — by no mistake — draws in part from the Hyperflight plus the Air Flight ‘89 and the Air Zoom Flight “The Glove”. We did around 20 collaborations in total really cool stuff like a five-shoe pack we released with Penny Hardaway in Las Vegas but the Flight Club was my “full circle” project where I was like “we’re gonna do this one in purple it’s made of unmolded Foamposite material it’s gonna look like a Hyperflight and that’s the whole idea.” Being able to take these icons from the past and reintroduce them in a new way was a blast.

Do you want the Hyperflight to be retroed again or would you prefer that Nike keep it in the archives?

I would like for it to be retroed correctly which hasn’t happened yet [laughs]. The last time they brought it back out which was like 2013 or so it was really on the heels of things like the Air Foamposite One “Galaxy” and the Air Foamposite One “Fighter Jet” so there were a lot of graphics being presented at that time. The Hyperflights were the same — there was one with a tiger print the colorways were all over the place. Personally I didn’t care for any of those retros. What made the Hyperflight so great was how clean it looked: bright colors with black borders. When they retroed it they gave it a whole different read and it wasn’t something I was super excited about.

“You can argue that guys like Kanye West Virgil Abloh and Travis Scott are more impactful to consumers than whatever three athletes with signature lines you can think of.”

No matter how technologically advanced modern-day signature basketball shoes may be they don’t seem to excite people and become cultural touch points the way Air Jordans and old Nike Basketball signature models did. Why is that? Is it because of the new designs themselves or is it because musicians designers and the like are the “new athletes” when it comes to moving products?

That’s definitely a big piece of it. You can argue that guys like Kanye West Virgil Abloh and Travis Scott are more impactful to consumers than whatever three athletes with signature lines you can think of. Another huge part is how style has shifted. In the ‘90s everything was so blocky and bulky. Now most things are a little sleeker and slimmer and the artists’ shoes fit into a lifestyle look a lot better than something from like LeBron James or Kyrie Irving’s signature line that has to be built a certain way to hold up on the court.

Do you think there are any models or lines that have the potential to become classics when we’re looking back on this era of basketball footwear in 10 or 15 years?

Yeah the first things that come to mind for me are the early shoes from Kyrie’s line the Kyrie 1 through the Kyrie 4. Those came off the court a little bit and the other one that sticks out to me is Kevin Durant’s KD 4. I can’t believe it’s been 10 years since the KD 4 was released but you’re seeing 8-10 guys around the NBA wearing it again this season out of nowhere. They had so many great themes and stories on that shoe like the “Weatherman” the “Water Dragon” and even the silver “Galaxy” colorway. I think those might work well if they were brought back.

Another lane that’s really interesting to me is modernization. Air Jordans have always had that 1:1 retro look and Kobe Bryant’s line got some under the hood improvements with the Protro line but I feel like there’s a lane for Nike to take more of those early 2010s signature shoes and modernize them like say adding Flyknit to the KD 4 or removing some of the Hyperfuse materials that felt really specific to that time period. I think there’s a lot of potential there but in general there’s a lot less models that you can look at and stamp as a “classic” today than there were in the ‘90s.

On the flip side of that where do you see signature basketball footwear headed in the next five years?

That’s a great question. I think a lot of people myself included are really curious to see what adidas Basketball‘s design language is going to be over the next few years now that Jerry Lorenzo’s there. We were talking about how these “artist shoes” don’t have to offer performance features earlier but if Jerry is able to combine what works well off the court with some advanced adidas technology that might be what adidas has been missing over the last three to five years in terms of signature hoop shoes. Jordan Brand and Nike seem to have their formula down and I’m really excited to see what PUMA and Under Armour come with as well. Li-Ning is making some cool shoes too and I think the other Chinese brands will really be stepping their game up.

“Kevin Durant [told me] this story about how as a rookie he signed a $60 million Nike contract in a Las Vegas hotel while he was there for a USA Basketball minicamp then went up to his room to change before going out to chill and putting on New Balances because he was 18 and that’s what he grew up with.”

On your new The Sneaker Game show you get to talk to some of the NBA’s sneaker luminaries about their own footwear journeys. What are some of the best stories you’ve heard?

Kevin Durant was our first guest and he gave some really interesting tidbits about what led him to re-up Nike over signing with Under Armour who offered him a huge deal. He also told us this story about how as a rookie he signed a $60 million Nike contract in a Las Vegas hotel while he was there for a USA Basketball minicamp then went up to his room to change before going out to chill and putting on New Balance because he was 18 and that’s what he grew up with in the DMV. Steph Curry also told me a really interesting story about how he was considering leaving Nike for Brandblack in 2013 before eventually signing with UA.

Final question: why are sneakers important to you?

Sneakers are a portal to the personalities of so many different people. They’ve become a canvas for how people tell their story: where they’re from what they’re passionate about. I’ve been fortunate to meet people from all over the world and have been able to connect with them through a shared love for sneakers. The designs are great the tech is interesting and it’s always fun to keep up with the new styles that are coming out — but the way sneakers bring people from all over the place together is definitely the coolest thing about them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL25pa2UtYWlyLW1heC05Ni1paS1kYTg3MzAtMTAwLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Air Max 96 II Surfaces in Pure Platinum With Bright Mango,"For 2021 Nike has officially brought back the Air Max 96 II in its classic sporty aesthetic imagined by famed Nike designer Sergio Lorenzo.

Then 28 the Brazilian was truly walking in the footsteps of the game’s giants.

But £23 million seemed an awful lot for someone the industry was starting to talk about. And not in a good way.

Some suggested Nike the company he had been associated with for 15 years was letting him go with two years still to run on his contract because he was high maintenance he wanted too much money his brand had been damaged by too many tantrums and tumbles particularly at Russia 2018 and others had overtaken him in the line of succession behind Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Others pointed out that Nike didn’t need its swoosh on his feet anymore after all he had it on his chest when he played for Paris Saint-Germain or Brazil.

But it takes more than whispers to stop a juggernaut and once this season had properly started and the dust settled nobody apart from a few brand managers were talking about why Nike would let one of their most high-profile athletes leave for a rival at what should be the peak of his powers.

Until Friday’s edition of the Wall Street Journal appeared online that is. In a shocking report the newspaper revealed that Nike cut ties with Neymar because he refused to co-operate with an investigation into a claim he sexually assaulted a female employee after a marketing event in 2016.

It is a story that instantly prompts comparisons with similar allegations made against Ronaldo in 2018 and the ongoing legal process that surrounds the Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson.

What exactly are the claims against Neymar?

Between winning a domestic double with Barcelona in 2015-16 and leading Brazil to Olympic gold in Rio later that summer Neymar visited New York City for a publicity campaign with basketball legend and fellow Nike icon Michael Jordan. The pair were collaborating on a new shoe range.

The alleged victim is a marketing executive who still works for Nike. She and her colleagues were working with Neymar on logistics for the product launch.

In the early hours of June 2 she and a colleague were asked by hotel staff to help Neymar into his room. The player seemed to be intoxicated after an evening in a nightclub.

The woman says she was briefly left alone in the room with Neymar and in that time he took off his underwear and tried to force her to perform oral sex. When she attempted to leave the room he blocked her exit and then chased her half-naked down the corridor.

Citing “people familiar with the matter” and documents The WSJ reports she told family friends and colleagues about the alleged incident that night and over the following days and weeks.

She did not make a complaint though until 2018 when other women at Nike were coming forward to share negative experiences as part of a survey about the treatment of women at the company. During this process she told Nike’s human resources boss and general counsel.

By this point Neymar had moved from Barcelona to PSG for a world-record fee of €222 million but continued to front Nike advertising campaigns including one that coincided with the 2019 Women’s World Cup and focused on female athletes.

It was at that time however that a Brazilian model accused Neymar of raping her in a hotel in Paris in May 2019. He said the sex was consensual and accused the model of trying to blackmail him.

The Brazilian authorities investigated the rape allegation but dropped the matter citing a lack of evidence. They subsequently charged her with extortion slander and procedural fraud but the first two charges were dropped before the end of the year and she was acquitted of fraud in 2020. She maintains her original story.

Having read about the case the Nike employee asked the executives she had confided in a year earlier about the status of her complaint. They told her that no action had been taken as they thought she had not wanted them to proceed.

Having established that was not the case Nike called in an external law firm to start interviewing witnesses. The company also helped her find legal representation and agreed to pay the bill.

Neymar however refused to co-operate with this investigation and was removed from Nike’s various advertising campaigns.

What does Nike say about this?

In a statement the US-based firm says it was “deeply disturbed” by the allegations adding it has always treated the employee’s claims “with great seriousness”.

Confirming the newspaper’s timeline Nike says when she first came forward in 2018 “she did so only with assurances of confidentiality”. Nike claims it was “prepared and ready to investigate at that time” but respected her initial desire to keep the matter confidential. It says it had to “respect her privacy and did not believe it was appropriate to share that information with law enforcement or any third party” without consent.

When that changed in 2019 Nike says it “acted immediately” but “the investigation was inconclusive”.

“No single set of facts emerged that would enable us to speak substantively on the matter” the statement continues. “It would be inappropriate for Nike to make an accusatory statement without being able to provide supporting facts. Nike ended its relationship with the athlete because he refused to co-operate in a good faith investigation of credible allegations of wrongdoing by an employee.”

The company’s long and seemingly successful relationship with the player was abruptly ended last August when a short Nike statement announced: “Neymar Jr. will no longer be a Nike player as of August 31 2020.”

Less than a fortnight later the official Puma Twitter account confirmed the player would be returning to billboards with the tweet: “Welcome to the fam @neymarjr #KingIsBack.”

What has Neymar said?

Earlier on Friday his spokeswoman told The Athletic his camp have nothing to add to the statement she gave to the newspaper.

Her statement says these claims are similar to the ones made by the Brazilian model in 2019 which she says Neymar was cleared of and are false.

“Neymar Jr. will vigorously defend himself against these baseless attacks in case any claim is presented which did not happen so far” she says adding that Neymar and Nike split for commercial reasons.

“It is very strange a case that was supposed to have happened in 2016 with allegations by a Nike employee came to light only at that moment.”

But later on Friday a new statement appeared on Neymar’s Instagram feed.

“Facts can be twisted because people see them from different angles” it says. “There’s no denying that life is like this. Be a part of it!

“I even understand when someone criticises my conduct the way I play the way I live my life. We are different!

“(But) I don’t really understand how a serious business can distort a business relationship that is backed up on documents. Written words cannot be altered. They sure are very clear. Leave no doubt!

“Ever since I was 13 when I signed my first contract I was always warned: don’t talk about your contracts! Contracts are classified! To go against this rule and claim that my contract was terminated because I did not contribute in good faith to an investigation is absurd liar.

“Once again I am warned that I cannot comment in public. Outraged I will obey!”

The statement however goes on to suggest Nike continued to work with him even bringing him back to America to work “with the same people” in 2017 2018 and 2019 despite apparently being aware of an allegation from 2016.

“A matter so serious and they did nothing” he continues adding he was not “given a chance to defend myself” or told who his accuser is.

The statement finishes with a reference to the fact that he wears Nike kit for club and country.

“Irony of fate I will continue to stamp on my chest a mark that has betrayed me. Such is life! I will remain firm and strong believing that time always cruel time will bring the real answers.”

This Instagram post followed an earlier one from his agent Wagner Ribeiro that is even more inflammatory.

“Nike didn’t want Neymar anymore” writes Ribeiro. “Nike couldn’t afford to break the contract. Nike asks a girl to invent Neymar’s sexual harassment. After five years Nike completes the strategy and tells the story.”

Neymar’s father has actually spoken to reporters in Brazil telling them Nike is “blackmailing” his son. He also incorrectly claimed that other athletes citing Ronaldo and the late basketball star Kobe Bryant quit the company facing allegations of a similar nature. In both of those cases Nike stood by their athletes as it has with Tiger Woods despite his well-publicised personal problems.

What have PSG said?

Bankrolled by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund the Parisians stunned global football when they met the exit clause in Neymar’s contract at Barcelona. Twice what anyone had paid for a footballer before the Catalans assumed it would scare predators away.

Neymar’s time in the French capital however has not quite delivered the success his chief sponsors wanted. There have been lots of goals and domestic silverware — this season is the first since he arrived that PSG have not finished as French champions — but the closest they have come to winning the Champions League the prize they crave was last year’s defeat in the final by Bayern Munich.

There have also been several injuries rows and sulks with frequent stories about him pining for Barcelona or even fancying a run-out for Real Madrid.

So there were some eyebrows raised when it was announced earlier this month that Neymar and PSG had signed up to another four years of each others’ company.

It has been suggested that the club did not extend his contract with any particular enthusiasm as they have grown tired of hosting the circus that has attached itself to Neymar and that one reason they renewed was because they did not think they would get anywhere near what they paid for him in a transfer market depressed by COVID-19. The fact that Qatar’s other football investment the 2022 World Cup is on the horizon may also have played a part in the decision to keep him on board. In Neymar’s defence the player remains popular with his team-mates and there is a feeling he has been more reliable in the past 18 months for the team.

The club however is yet to say anything about the Wall Street Journal’s revelations and is understood to be carefully considering what it can say given the fact that the allegations go back to a time when he was not their player there does not appear to be any police complaint and Neymar’s personal contracts are his own affair.

However The Athletic understands the news has hit PSG hard and they are planning to write to Barcelona to ask if Nike ever raised the issue with them. This would appear unlikely as Nike has already explained that the employee did not raise it with the firm’s HR department until 2018 after his move to France although it is also said that she did describe details of the incident to Nike colleagues earlier.

What is equally unlikely though is any huge show of public support for their player as Juventus memorably did for Ronaldo in 2018 when Las Vegas police reopened an investigation into an alleged rape in 2009. The former Portuguese star and the alleged victim reached a private settlement in 2010 but details of the case were leaked to a German newspaper.

For a period it looked like the scandal could topple football’s most sought-after sandwich board but Ronaldo and his many sponsors kept quiet and when the police investigation was dropped the world moved on.

Neymar his club his country and his many sponsors (he has 16 including Qatar Airways and Qatar National Bank as well as a deal with Epic Games the makers of Fortnite that has only recently been signed) will be hoping he can follow Ronaldo’s trajectory more smoothly this time.

Puma for what it is worth has declined to comment.

Faulkner has a supporting role in the movie “A Party Gone Wrong” about a teenager and her former friend kidnapped by a twisted rideshare driver who plans to sell their organs on the black market.

Faulkner plays Taylor who is friends with one of the girls.

“I’m excited; I’m very excited” said Faulkner who relocated to the Los Angeles area nearly six years ago after graduating from Radford University with degrees in theatre and English. “I haven’t seen it. I’ll be watching it at the same time as everyone else.”

Exactly where she will watch it is still up in the air – either at a friend’s home or fingers crossed a yacht.

“I hope that ends up being the case” she said. “That would end up being really cool.”

Faulkner is not the only regional tie to the production. The movie filmed in Roanoke for about three weeks last October because the director has ties to the city which was a much safer area than Los Angeles during the coronavirus pandemic.

“It was shot entirely in Roanoke” Faulkner said. “People will definitely recognize Hotel Roanoke.” Other filming locations include Layman Family Farms the Jefferson Center and the Norfolk Southern Rail Yard.

The actress said the turnaround time from audition to filming the movie was quick. She saw the audition notice in late August or early September and within two months she had snared the role and shot the movie. She found out on a Wednesday that she got the role and was on a Roanoke-bound plane less than two days later.

“Shooting in Roanoke just made more sense” she told the Bland County Messenger last year. “It was the first feature film I shot and it was especially special to me because I returned to where I grew up and returned to where my love of performing blossomed. It was important to come home and shoot my first - and not last - feature film.”

Filming the movie was a lot of work “but it’s absolutely the kind of work I love so it wasn’t difficult” Faulkner said. “There were five to six days of night shoots. So I was getting up at 4 p.m. and going to the set around 7 p.m. and getting home at 7 a.m.”

Faulkner appears throughout the movie.

“I’ll be there from beginning to end” she said. “Although I haven’t seen it I’m expected to be comic relief in what otherwise is a very serious film.”

Faulkner’s friends in Wythe and Bland counties California and other places are excited to see Faulkner in the movie.

“It seems like a lot of people – even people I don’t know that well – have reached out to say they have it ready to record and plan to watch. So that feels really good.”

A 2011 graduate of Rocky Gap High School Faulkner performed in plays at Wytheville Community College and at the Wohlfahrt Haus Dinner Theatre while growing up. She has been on the West Coast for nearly six years finding work as a model and actress. She currently works as an improv actor at a pop-up bar that combines magic and mixology.

“It’s like a bar but not quite. It’s kind of a crossover between a performance and a bar” she said. “It’s a fairly new concept popping up all over the city.”

Faulkner hopes her experience with “A Party Gone Wrong” will lead to more television movie roles. Her ultimate goal is to find steady work as an actress.

“I’ve been auditioning for more Lifetime films” she said. “I’ve gotten close to landing roles but not quite.”

Tim Parker who was appointed to the unpaid post in 2014 will step down in the autumn it was announced last week. Because of the pandemic he had agreed to stay on after completing two three-year terms.

The NT’s announcement of Parker’s resignation came a day after an organisation of members Restore Trust had circulated a motion for the annual general meeting in the autumn declaring no confidence in Parker. It called for fresh leadership to “regain the nation’s confidence” in the 126-year-old charity.

The motion was reported to have received 50 signatures among almost 6 million members of the trust by the time the announcement was made.

Parker’s resignation was hailed by some as a “victory against woke”. A statement on Restore Trust’s website said Parker had resigned following the publication of its motion. “His position was clearly untenable given everything that has happened and the current crisis of confidence in the National Trust among its staff volunteers and members” it said.

Toby Young the libertarian commentator tweeted: “Let’s hope this sends a message to the heads of other national institutions who pander to anti-British leftwing activists and ignore their patriotic small c conservative members: Get Woke Go Broke.”

Sir John Hayes a Conservative MP and NT member told the Daily Mail that the trust had “sadly lost sight of its purpose. It is preoccupied with the prejudices of a woke minority”.

But a spokesperson for the trust said the timing of Parker’s resignation had nothing to do with the no-confidence motion. “Because we were in the midst of the pandemic he decided to continue [beyond the end of his second term] to ensure the trust had some stability and leadership to get us through the pandemic.”

Last autumn some trust members criticised Parker’s comments that Black Lives Matter was a “human rights movement with no party-political affiliations”. Parker said at the virtual annual meeting last autumn that “in no way” had the trust become a political organisation that had been taken over “by a bunch of woke folk or anything of that nature”.

The spokesperson said: “Parker could have chosen not to renew for a third term as chair if he had been worried about that criticism.”

Instead he stayed on until NT houses were permitted to reopen earlier this month formally telling fellow trustees on 18 May of his decision to step down in October. This was six days before Restore Trust published its motion criticising Parker.

The NT announced the move on 25 May after ensuring staff volunteers supporters and stakeholders were made aware said the spokesperson.

Restore Trust was founded earlier this year to “change the ethos” of the NT one of its founders was quoted as saying. According to its website the NT “has recently given the impression that it has been taking sides on divisive issues. This has distracted staff and supporters from the vital task of looking after our heritage”.

Restore Trust did not respond to requests for comment from the Observer.

The NT’s 10-year strategy plan up to the year 2025 “For everyone for ever” commits the organisation to “diversity and inclusion and “playing our part to create a fair equal society free from discrimination”.

Among issues that have exercised some members in recent months is a report published by the trust last September detailing the connections some of its properties have with slavery and colonialism.

The 93 properties and places in the report around a third of the total included Winston Churchill’s country estate Chartwell because of his political roles and opposition to self-governance in India Lundy island in Devon where convicts were forced into unpaid labour and Hare Hill in Cheshire whose owner traded slaves on a huge scale.

The trust was not seeking to make judgments about the past Tarnya Cooper its curatorial and collections director told the Guardian it was to raise awareness about the complexity of history in relation to place.

“We are not doing anything more than present the historical facts and data… People [should] draw their own conclusions and make their own minds up about things” she said.

Another source of contention was an internal document that suggested the trust focus on its outdoor assets rather than an “outdated mansion experience” to reach new audiences.

The document proposed putting thousands of artworks and other items into storage in order to “flex our mansion offer to create more active fun and useful experiences”. Specialist exhibitions for the NT’s “niche audiences” should be scaled back it said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1ub3J0aGVybi1pcmVsYW5kLTU3Mjg0MzI10gE5aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3VrLW5vcnRoZXJuLWlyZWxhbmQtNTcyODQzMjUuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,County Antrim GP-based counselling service cut after tax change,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLW5vcnRoZXJuLWlyZWxhbmQtNTcyODE4MTjSATtodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY28udWsvbmV3cy91ay1ub3J0aGVybi1pcmVsYW5kLTU3MjgxODE4LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DUP: A critical time for Edwin Poots' 'critical friend',When it comes to the Poots-Bradley pairing supporters view it as a sensible plan and privately feel Mr Poots will be able to take a tougher stance on some issues with his deputy reassuring those moderate DUP voices and voters.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvdGhlLW5hdGlvbmFsLXRydXN0cy0yMS1iZXN0LWdhcmRlbnMtdG8tdmlzaXQtdjdkcmxjejk10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The National Trust's 21 best gardens to visit,"Irises are the star attraction at this world-famous garden lighting up the garden briefly but spectacularly.

The gardens of Wentworth Castle near Barnsley are home to the national collection of rhododendron species which will be at their colourful best right now. There’s also a Victorian conservatory full of exotic plants a “Union Jack” garden (an 18th-century wilderness garden with a distinctive crisscross layout) and the ruins of Stainborough Castle the perfect",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWxmYXN0dGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdWsvbmF0aW9uYWwtdHJ1c3QtdGVzdHMtb3V0LXN1c3RhaW5hYmxlLWFsdGVybmF0aXZlcy10by1wbGFzdGljLXRyZWUtZ3VhcmRzLzQwNDg1ODAyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,National Trust tests out sustainable alternatives to plastic tree guards,"The charity is trialling more natural options to plastic as it gets its huge tree planting and woodland creation drive under way.

The National Trust is testing out sustainable alternatives to plastic tree guards as part of its efforts to increase woodland cover on its land the charity said.

Alternatives to the plastic guards which protect saplings from animal grazing and other damage include using “crates” built from locally-felled diseased trees using existing shrubs to protect young trees and cardboard tubes.

The trust which has committed to planting or establishing 20 million trees by 2030 as part of efforts to cut its emissions to net zero said it already routinely collects and reuses the plastic guards.

Chestnut crates protected young trees on the South Downs (National Trust/PA)

But the time and expense of reusing the plastic guards which have commonly been used in tree planting since the 1970s on a large scale is becoming more of a problem as tree-planting ramps up to tackle climate change the trust said.

And some of the guards which have been reused for more than 30 years are coming to the end of their lifespan.

So the conservation charity which has planted 60000 trees this year is trialling new methods that are more in keeping with nature to protect newly planted saplings as they get established in the landscape.

In one method crates or small fenced areas constructed from locally-felled wood are spaced across the landscape with saplings planted inside them surrounded by blackthorn or thorny plants that will grow and continue to defend against animal damage after the crates disintegrate.

Scattering the planting across the landscape means pockets of saplings will grow and set seed to naturally create joined-up woodland over time.

At Coniston Hall in the Lake District around 4000 saplings have been planted over winter in 46 crates created from untreated diseased larch wood which is not considered to be a disease risk to the new trees with a further 3000 planted “naked” on Bleathwaite.

The crates contain between 25 and 120 trees surrounded by thorny shrubs.

In the South Downs robust crates have been created using sweet chestnut from the surrounding landscape and contain one to 20 saplings .

At Ennerdale in the Lake District around 20000 native trees have been planted along the River Liza combined with conifer cuttings to enable more mixed woodland to develop.

There has been a dramatic shift away from plastic tree guards on the project the trust said and some trees have been planted within the felled conifer brash to protect them from grazing.

Saplings and thorny shrubs planted in the Lake District cages (National Trust/PA)

At Hardcastle Crags West Yorkshire and in Somerset cardboard tubes have been trialled with mixed success as they biodegrade quickly and leave saplings still vulnerable to animal damage.

Cardboard and wool tubes are not yet proven cost effective alternatives to plastic with the large-scale planting the trust is undertaking the charity said.

Other approaches include allowing trees to regenerate naturally and planting in shrubland where vegetation such as gorse and hawthorn can protect young trees.

The National Trust said that while it was difficult to move away from plastic guards entirely it hoped the crates and other methods could be used at scale across its landscapes.

John Deakin head of trees and woodlands at the trust said: “We have made a massive commitment to plant or establish 20 million trees on our land in the next 10 years – and have already made a great start.

“However we are mindful of the potential unintended consequence of this and how you protect these trees. We are exploring every possible option to minimise this impact.”

He said trees must be allowed to reach maturity to achieve their maximum potential for storing carbon providing homes for nature and public access to woodlands.

And he said: “In time we hope to allow trees to self-propagate – there is no substitute for the ability of trees to naturally regenerate.

“In the meantime however we must explore everything we possibly can to minimise the environmental impact of what we are trying to achieve.”"

For several months now the courts have been put to a different purpose—that of a COVID vaccination clinic. Tens of thousands of shots have been administered as volunteers medical personnel and patients move through the clinic in rapid military-like efficiency.

The world is healing one shot at a time. But at Augusta Health another layer of healing is happening to the tune of sounds not normally found on a tennis court or at a vaccination clinic. There’s a saying that music is healing. Thanks to HeartStrings a unique initiative between Staunton’s Heifetz International Music Institute and Augusta Health there has been some very special healing happening in Fishersville.

The opportunity to combat a deadly disease by getting a vaccination is a relief to many but the very act of being moved through an assembly line that includes a needle and an experimental vaccine is stressful and that is on top of a year of stress. We have watched friends and family sicken and some die during the deadly pandemic. We have yearned to be with loved ones but have been separated by a wall of caution.

Enter HeartStrings. In the tennis-courts-turned-vaccine-clinic the sweet sound of a bow being drawn across strings fills the cavernous space. A viola two violins and a cello send out the sounds of Mozart then an Appalachian melody and finally the theme from Star Wars. People stop talking and listen tense bodies relax and when each piece is finished clapping echoes through the space.

In a room at the hospital proper a patient on a ventilator watches her own private concert on an iPad while she mouths the words to the music she requested. Tears of joy flow from the musician on the screen the medical personnel and the patient.

Last summer Heifetz was in the midst of a shutdown just like the rest of the world. The international program which usually brings to Staunton instructors and students from around the world went totally virtual.

“Our summer program was all virtual. Somehow we made it work across 14 countries nine time zones with 100 students and 40 faculty” Heifetz President and CEO Ben Roe said. Roe continued to think about the situation and explore ways that he could simultaneously help his institute his students and his community.

“We had a twin crisis in our community. There was the pandemic and the toll that it was taking on the physical and mental health of the community and then there were our students who are on the cusps of their professional careers and had the rug pulled out from under them” he explained.

He found himself wondering if there was a way to address both crises with one solution. Thus was born the Heifetz Ensemble In Residence program (HEIR) that brought in five young musicians – four on stringed instruments and a piano player – to live in a bubble for six weeks play and be paid professionally. Through community sponsorships the five musicians could live eat be provided with rehearsal and performance space and receive a salary. In addition to Augusta Health key support for the program came from Heifetz board member Robin Miller a partner in the Blackburn Inn and Conference Center. The Blackburn provided housing for three of the HEIR musicians and provided virtually unlimited access to rehearsal and performance space.

Roe’s brainstorming did not stop there. Conversations with other community leaders about the toll the pandemic was taking on community mental health soon led to a partnership with Augusta Health. Part of the program included HeartStrings in which the HEIR musicians presented one-on-one concerts to patients and resident populations isolated by the pandemic.

The results have been remarkable according to Dr. Clint Merritt population health chief at Augusta Health. “The healing power of music came at a perfect time. The impact for the patients and staff because of the beautiful music and connection to life has been incredible” he explained.

Shelley Payne patient experience coordinator at the hospital was equally enthusiastic. She described patients being so moved by the personal performances that they had tears and a deaf patient holding the iPad to feel the vibrations becoming more focused and relaxed than she had been for some time.

Recently the second group of HEIR musicians finished out its program in Staunton. With a week left in the program they stopped by the Augusta Health COVID clinic for a regular Tuesday performance. This day was extra special however because two of the musicians siblings Kenneth and Noelle Naito of Elkridge Md. were not only in Fishersville to perform they were also each receiving their second dose of the COVID vaccination.

During the observation period after their shot they sat and reflected on what the Heifetz program has meant to them as budding professional violinists. When the pandemic hit Kenneth 21 was a student at Juilliard School and Noelle was finishing up high school.

“Being here has been amazing. I came home in March last year from Juilliard and was stuck at home for over a year. The inability to perform live music and of being stripped of what our life was has been really scary at times” Kenneth explained.

“Coming here and being able to connect with people again even if it is playing for one person is amazing. Playing for the patients at Augusta Health over Zoom was memorable. We learned that music can really change people” added Noelle 18.

The other two stringed instrument musicians in the HEIR ensemble have also been rejuvenated by their six-week stint in Staunton. Viola player Adam Savage of Port St. Lucie Fla. who is 18 explained that he was thankful for the opportunity to provide entertainment and hope to people again. “Patients are in need of hope and beauty and music can give them that. I haven’t done anything live for a while and it was nice to have live applause again” he said.

Cello player Jared Blajian is the group’s elder statesman at 26. The New York City musician was grateful for a chance to play a small role during the pandemic. “The front line workers are the real heroes but to be able to give something back like music is healing in its own way” Jared said.

“Something that I have learned is that the healing power of music reaches so many. It doesn’t matter if it is a concert hall or a vaccine clinic live music can move people and touch people” he added.

The effect of live music at the vaccination clinic brought unsolicited testimony from grateful patients and volunteers alike. Eileen Brooks a clinic volunteer said that the music uplifted everyone’s spirits and brought a calming sensation. “It was a nice distraction in a pleasant way. Some people are very scared to come in here and this calmed them down” she said.

“It seemed a little nutty at first” said Roe of the HEIR program. “But it prompted a lot of collaboration and reimagining of protocols and systems. We are here to serve the community. It was emotional for the audiences and the players to be able to come together. It was a profoundly moving experience and the musicians have also learned that when playing you don’t always have to have the beautiful conditions of a concert hall to connect with music.”

To which can be added the question: “Is there any other vaccination clinic in the entire world with live music?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZGVmYnJpZWYuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMzAvdXMtc3BlY2lhbC1mb3JjZXMtbWlzdGFrZW5seS1zdG9ybS1vbGl2ZS1vaWwtZmFjdG9yeS1kdXJpbmctZHJpbGwtaW4tYnVsZ2FyaWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US special forces mistakenly storm olive oil factory during drill in Bulgaria,"A team of US special operators mistakenly entered a private olive oil factory during the recent exercise Swift Response exercise that took place in Bulgaria.

In total the Pentagon (DoD) requested a budget of US$ 752.9 billion from the US Congress of which US$ 112 billion. are for research development testing and evaluation only representing the highest investment request for this aspect ever up 5.1% from FY2021.

According to a Flightglobal the USAF has stated that its budget priorities include the development and acquisition of the B-21 Raider a new stealth bomber; upgrades to the B-52 Stratofortress continue acquisitions of the F-35A Lightning II; the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent a new nuclear ballistic missile that will replace the LGM-30G Minuteman III; the NGAD cited above; the next-generation Persistent Infrared Missile Alert Satellite System; and the Advanced Battle Management System a communications network under development on the battlefield.

In order to reduce costs the USAF will retire a number of older aircraft including fighter jets communications aircraft drones and tankers.

The lifting of Flightglobal points out that the withdrawal of all these aircraft would bring savings of US$ 1373 billion in FY2022.

“In the period 2035-2040 the Air Force must have a fighter fleet that provides the capability capability and affordability to meet the needs of air superiority and global assault for the defense of our nation both in competition and conflict” says the Force. “To achieve the desired fighter fleet the Air Force must scale current aircraft inventories to accelerate the transition of less capable and aging aircraft and emphasize investment in future capabilities such as modernization of the NGAD and F-35.”

Despite the reduction in expenses Congress must still approve the retirement of the aircraft which will be evaluated soon. For aircraft acquisitions the USAF has requested for FY2022:

Over the last couple of weeks Royal Caribbean (and its sibling cruise brands) moved the closest yet to real sailings out of the United States and it has a lot of cruise fans excited.

After more than 15 months of no cruises from North America we are swiftly looking at the real prospect of summer cruises. Essentially restart plans went from ""if"" to ""when"" in many people's minds.

While a restart is very close cruise lines are not out of the proverbial woods quite yet and there are some hurdles and challenges left to overcome.

Here are the most important things you should know about Royal Caribbean's restart plans.

Adults (and some kids) need to be vaccinated

For months Royal Caribbean was uncertain if passengers would need to be vaccinated and the answer now appears to be yes.

If you are thinking about going on a cruise ship this summer or fall you will need to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19.

The cruise line updated its policy recently to all adults over the age of 16 on North American sailings will need to be vaccinated in order to go on a cruise before August 1. After August 1 that age restriction drops to 12 years old.

Royal Caribbean has not said much since the policy was changed but it is clear they are looking to mitigate risk as much as possible. In an industry that is unfairly and unfortunately associated with outbreaks they cannot afford to take chances.

Could this policy change? Certainly as life gets back to normal and the vaccine becomes more widely available there is always a chance this policy could be relaxed. But in the meantime plan to be vaccinated if you want to cruise this summer.

Test cruises will be necessary first

While Celebrity Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line are going to straight to revenue sailings Royal Caribbean International will have to conduct test cruises first and then move to revenue sailings.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) gave cruise lines two choices: get 95% of passengers and 98% of crew fully vaccinated and skip test cruises or do test cruises first.

Royal Caribbean opted to do test cruises simply because they are a family cruise line and knew they could not get to 95% of its guests fully vaccinated primarily due to the amount of children onboard.

This means each ship will need to conduct a series of test cruises to demonstrate its new health protocols can work before the CDC will approve a ship to sail with paying passengers.

Speaking of test cruises if you are interested in being a volunteer on a test cruise there does appear to be a way to volunteer and hope you get picked.

So far Royal Caribbean has announced test cruises will begin in June on Freedom of the Seas but expect more ships to get the go-ahead as well.

Slow approach to restart

Don't expect Royal Caribbean to announce all most or even half of its ships restarting immediately. Or even over the next few months.

For many months Royal Caribbean (and all cruise lines) have been emphatic that their restart will be slow and methodical.

Royal Caribbean Group Chairman and CEO Richard Fain said very early on in the shutdown restart will be structured ""We don't expect that... someday somebody blows a horn and all the ships start operating right away. We think that it will be a gradual start a little bit like society is opening up gradually.""

""So we would imagine that we would start with fewer ships and more likely to be more drive markets in the beginning and then it would then evolve and grow from there.""

As an example Norwegian Cruise Line just announced restart plans for 8 ships and many are not going to begin their first sailings until October or November 2021.

So far Royal Caribbean has only announced Alaska cruises from Seattle as the confirmed sailings from the U.S. this summer.

As cruise fans we are eager to get back onboard on our favorite ships from ports of call nearby but keep expectations inline.

CDC still holds a lot of influence

Like it or not the CDC is still mostly in charge.

The road to restart goes right through the CDC's jurisdiction and the cruise lines seem to be past trying to shake them off and are now focused on getting approval to sail.

The tone of discussions with the CDC has radically improved lately especially with the CDC rolling back burdensome rules and protocols.

Perhaps more surprising is cruises sailing from outside the United States still seem to be based on CDC guidance.

Royal Caribbean has not released its health protocols for Adventure of the Seas cruises from Nassau Bahamas due to in part the CDC.

An email update yesterday told guests ""As we’ve been working to finalize all the details we’re taking a lot into consideration including the CDC’s recommendations Bahamian Health Authority’s guidance and our own Healthy Sail Panel’s expertise – to find that sweet spot.""

No matter where ships sail this summer the CDC will be along for the ride for at least a while longer.

Florida

Celebrity Cruises referred to it as ""the elephant in the room"" and Florida has gone from chief enabler to major blocker of cruises restarting.

In short Florida passed a law that prohibits any business from asking their customers for proof of vaccination. While this may make sense in the case of restaurants or supermarkets it creates an enormous problem for cruise lines who are battling a sensationalized media that counts any case onboard a ship as a modern day Pandora's Box.

The Governor's office has been adamant about enforcing the policy across the board including the cruise lines. Meanwhile cruise executives are talking about some kind of compromise that is in the works.

What ends up happening is anyone's guess but Florida is the epicenter of the cruise world and while ships could sail from other states it is a market too large to ignore.

In the meantime it is a story to keep an eye on as it relates to where and when cruise ships will be able to sail from first.",,,,,,,,,

Box art and images of custom RTX 3080 Tis by ZOTAC Colorful and even Lenovo have been leaked by WhyCry. NVIDIA is expected to announce the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti in the live stream tomorrow and the GPUs will be available to buy by the 3rd and 10th of June 2021.

ZOTAC Colorful and Lenovo RTX 3080 Tis pictured

First up we have the Colorful iGAME ADVANCED RTX 3080 Ti GPU which featured that impressive-looking 3 slot cooler. While we do not know the clock speeds on this baby we do know that you can expect even crazier designs with the KUDAN lineup. On the other hand the ZOTAC family divided into the AMP Holo and Trinity families. AMP has historically been the highest clocked variant while Trinity is the standard non-OC variant. Trinity will be clocked at the reference clock speed of 1665 MHz but AMP could be anywhere from 50 MHz to 100 Mhz over this number. Both rock 12GB of GDDR6X memory.

Finally we have GPUs from a new AIB: Lenovo. Lenovo calls these cards the RTX 3080 Ti Legion and while its going to be hard to find these cards on the shelf we have a feeling we will be seeing a lot of these in OEM builds. The cooler profile is also upgraded from two slots to three slots - something which will help in dissipating the heat buildup of the 350W GA102-225 GPU.

Recap: NVIDIA's RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti

The NVIDIA RTX 3070 Ti will be based on the GA104-400 GPU and have 6144 CUDA cores divided into 48 GPU clusters. This means it has exactly 2 more clusters than its non-Ti variant and 20 less than the RTX 3080. It will feature 48 RT cores (cor comparison the RTX 3080 has 68) which is also 2 more than the RTX 3070 and 20 less than the RTX 3080. ROPs will be 96 for this segment of NVIDIA's lineup and the clock speed is yet to be confirmed. It will feature a 256-bit memory bus with 8 GB or 16 GB GDDR6X memory clocked at 19 Gbps. It is currently scheduled for release in June 2021 alongside the RTX 3080 Ti.

Interestingly the RTX 3070 Ti is positioned as something of a replacement of the RTX 3070 because it's not *that* powerful compared to its namesake. With just a difference of 2 GPU clusters there's only so much performance to be gained. The RTX 3080 Ti on the other hand rocks a massive difference when compared to its namesake.

The RTX 3080 Ti has 12 more GPU clusters compared to the RTX 3080 for a total of 10240 cores (2 less than the RTX 3090). It has 80 RT cores and 112 ROPs. It will be coupled with a 12 GB GDDR6X vRAM buffer and a 384-bit bus for a total of 912 GB/s. It is clearly a monster of a card and from the specifications it appears to be a very slightly less-powerful replacement of the RTX 3090 and the true flagship of NVIDIA's ampere lineup.

Both of these graphic cards are currently expected to be announced on May 31 with a launch expected by 3rd and 10th June respectively. It would also be very interesting to see how much NVIDIA cripples mining performance on these cards. If they manage to cripple it to a large enough extent we might just see these cards available for close to MSRP from AIB and retail partners although I wouldn't hold my breath about it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtcmVjeWNsZXMtcnR4LTMwODAtZmUtY29vbGVyLWZvci1ydHgtMzA4MC10aS1mZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia Recycles RTX 3080 FE Cooler For Upcoming RTX 3080 Ti FE,"VideoCardz has shared alleged images of Nvidia's approaching GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition graphics card so it looks like we'll have a new contender for our list of Best Graphics Cards soon. The new Ampere offering looks like a carbon copy of the existing GeForce RTX 3080.

Nvidia didn't do much with the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition — it appears that the chipmaker literally only added the ""Ti"" moniker to the GeForce RTX 3080's shroud. The graphics card still retains the same dual-slot design which raises the question of how the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will dissipate the extra heat.

The GeForce RTX 3080 is rated for 320W and the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is rumored to conform within the 350W limit the same as the flagship GeForce RTX 3090. However the GeForce RTX 3090 features a triple-slot cooler to keep the heat under control. It'll be interesting to see what the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti's cooling system can do with 350W.

The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will still draw its power from Nvidia's 12-pin PCIe power connector. It's more than enough to provide the necessary power for the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti. If you're not a fan of the connector a simple adapter is enough to solve your problems. As always custom GeForce RTX 3080 Ti models will stick with the conventional 6-pin and 8-pin PCIe power connectors. In terms of power requirements the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is perfectly fine with a 750W power supply unit on mainstream systems.

By now it shouldn't come as a surprise that the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will potentially offer the same number and type of display outputs as the GeForce RTX 3080 or GeForce RTX 3090. If you've forgotten the mix of outputs includes three DisplayPort 1.4a outputs and one standard HDMI 2.1 port.

At the risk of sounding like a broken record the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti should perform very similarly to the GeForce RTX 3090. The graphics card has already appeared in a GPU-Z submission where its specifications were completely exposed. The only missing piece to the puzzle is pricing which we may find out on May 31 if Nvidia's recent GeForce teaser is legit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9jdXN0b20tbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwODAtdGktbW9kZWwtYXBwZWFycy1pbi1sZWFrZWQtZ3B1LXotc2NyZWVuc2hvdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Custom NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti model appears in leaked GPU-Z screenshot,"NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti with factory-overclocking

French website reveals the specs of a custom model with GA102-225 GPU.

The GPU-Z software has recently been updated to the 2.40.0 version with full support for the upcoming RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti graphics cards. Guys over at Ginjfo thought they would demonstrate the support by revealing the screenshot featuring the one and only – RTX 3080 Ti. The sub vendor ID is hidden but it is shown on the right as 1458. This means that the graphics card is made by Gigabyte who is working on the Gaming Vision and Eagle series (not to mention the AORUS but those are higher-clocked for sure).

The screenshot confirms the PCI Device ID of 2208 as well as the NVIDIA 466.54 press driver for the RTX 3080 Ti. Do note that this driver does not support RTX 3070 Ti hence why we are not seeing any leaks yet. The GPU-Z software correctly recognizes the ROP and TMU count of 112 and 320 respectively. Right below we attached the previous GPU-Z readout from the public validation which listed 853 TMUs which is obviously wrong.

NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition has a base clock of 1365 MHz which is mirrored in the screenshot. The boost clock however is factory-modified to 1710 MHz which is 45 MHz higher than the reference clock (1665 MHz). A confirmation on memory specs is also provided. The RTX 3080 Ti features 12GB GDDR6X memory clocked at 19 Gbps. This enabled a bandwidth of up to 912.4 GB/s.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will be announced on May 31st with reviews going live on June 2nd. First orders will be taken starting from June 3rd. There are quite a few embargoes out there not to mention the RTX 3070 Ti review embargo lifting a week later.

The last time Old Dominion University won a conference baseball title Bill Clinton was in his first term as president Nintendo 64 was the hottest thing to hit the market and Princess Diana and Prince Charles divorced.



Space Jam was all the rage at the movie theaters.



And not a single one of ODU's current 44 players had been born.



ODU won the CAA tournament for the third consecutive year on May 18 1996 in Kinston North Carolina when the Monarchs rallied in the bottom of the ninth to defeat James Madison 4-3.



Matt Quatraro now a member of ODU's Athletic Hall of Fame blasted two home runs in that game and pitcher and infielder Ron Walker was named tournament MVP. Tony Guzzo then ODU's head coach and now a special assistant to head coach Chris Finwood was named CAA Coach of the Year.



In the 25 years since the Monarchs hadn't brought home a trophy.



Until Sunday that is when they played as they usually have this year with determination poise and old-fashioned guts and beat Louisiana Tech 7-5 in 10 innings to claim the Conference USA title in Ruston Louisiana.



It was the kind of victory that was characteristic of this team full of big plays and heroic performances.



Heroic? How about Robbie Petracci who tore his ACL last month and who came into the game as a pinch hitter and drilled a home run. He didn't run all that gingerly around the bases but it didn't matter because without his home run in the top of the eighth LA Tech would have won before the game went into extra innings.



Or Ryne Moore Jason Hartline and Noah Dean who had pitched earlier this week and in spite of tired arms hurled 2 2/3 solid innings of relief.



Clutch? How about Aaron Holliday who has struggled much of this season as a relief pitcher entering the game and throwing 1 1/3 scoreless innings to get the victory. He struck out the first two batters in the bottom the tenth and then after walking a player forced Hunter Wells who led Conference USA in batting during the regular season ground out to clinch the victory.







Obstacles? The Monarchs played before 2484 full-throated LA Tech fans (the crowd looked bigger) crammed into the 2500-seat J.C. Love Field at Pat Patterson Park a stadium Finwood calls ""the best in Conference USA.""



It was a hostile environment. The crowd let out a thunderous ovation when their team tied ODU 5-5 in the bottom of the ninth on a Parker Bates solo shot that went on for several minutes.



Louisiana Tech seemed to be the team of destiny and their fans certainly believed it as the game headed into the 10th. The Bulldogs lost their second game of the tournament to Southern Miss then rallied from deep deficits twice to beat Southern Miss on Saturday and knock the Golden Eagles out of the tournament.



The fans were on their feet as Kyle Battle who led C-USA with 17 home runs stepped to the plate in the top of the tenth. Shortstop Tommy Bell had been hit by a pitch and was on first base.



""Wouldn't it be nice"" said athletic director Wood Selig who was doing commentary on the ODU Sports Radio Network ""if the leading home run hitter on the team that leads the nation in home runs knocked one out of the park?""



Seconds later that's just what Battle did sending a line drive perhaps 30 or 40 feet over the right side of the center field fence.



As soon as his bat hit the ball Battle knew it was gone.



""Oh yeah"" said Battle a senior from suburban Richmond. ""I got all of that ball.



""It was a fastball and I got all of it.""







When I asked what was going through his mind when he stepped up to the plate he said ""I treated it like any other at bat to be honest.""



But as he was rounding first base the enormity of what he'd just done hit him. He said that he blacked out for a few minutes.



""I don't remember anything after that"" he said of his jaunt around the bases.



And who can blame him? It was the biggest home run of the year for a team that has a chance to become the best in ODU history.



ODU was ranked 10th in the NCAA RPI coming into the game and it appears the Monarchs will move into seventh when the RPI comes out Sunday.



""The winner of this game should be a No. 1 seed"" Selig said.



That will almost certainly be the case. Conference USA is rated as the nation's fifth-best baseball league and will have four teams in the tournament – Southern Miss Charlotte and LA Tech which will host a regional.



Clearly the best team in the such a rugged lead deserves to be No. 1.



The advantage to being a No. 1 seed is that you play a No. 4 seed in the first game. That's a game the Monarchs should win.







ODU is 42-14 and has won seven games in a row and 10 of its last 11. The NCAA tournament committee likes teams that finish strong and the Monarchs are red hot.



The victory was especially meaningful and emotional for Finwood who lost his wife on April 1 to pancreatic cancer. The Monarchs rallied around their coach and vowed to win for him and his family.



They were also determined to win this tournament in part to get their picture on the outfield wall of the Bud Metheny Baseball Complex along with those three CAA champions.



Finwood choked up when being interviewed by Ted Alexander ODU's radio voice.



""Our kids are unbelievable"" he said. ""They really fight for each other.""



His voice broke as he added: ""Their picture is going up on the wall.""



After the ODU victory Twitter lit up with congratulations pouring in for Finwood who is beloved in the coaching profession. However Petracci was trending thanks to a Tweet from ODU baseball saying he had a torn ACL when he hit the home run.



By midnight Sunday it had been liked or re-tweeted more than 1500 times. And dozens of other baseball sites also tweeted about the freshman from Egg Harbor Township New Jersey.



Battle said the Monarchs came into the game ""with a nothing to lose mindset"" and that allowed them to relax even in a hostile stadium where the Monarchs often drew boos and catcalls.



""We set a goal of going to Omaha (for the College World Series) before the season started"" he said. ""It's great that we won the tournament but we still have a lot left to do.""







When asked how it felt to hit the biggest home run of the season he shrugged.



""This is all on them"" he said of his teammates. ""I just happened to hit it when we took the lead.""



Finwood received a Gatorade bath in the tumultuous post-game celebration and even the LA Tech fans cheered the Monarchs as they hoisted the championship trophy.



Did I mention that LA Tech was a fantastic host?



Bell was named the tournament MVP and besides being a vacuum cleaner at shortstop he had eight hits in 13 at bats (a .615 average) and belted three home runs. He scored seven runs and had eight RBI in four games.



His three-run blast in the top of the sixth gave the Monarchs a 4-3 lead their first of the game.



His MVP award is named for C-USA Assistant Commissioner Russ Anderson who died unexpectedly at age 50 a few months ago. Anderson has been with C-USA since it was founded and baseball was his favorite sport. He was not only one of the best in the sports information business he was just a wonderful guy.



I can't think of a better guy to win the first Russ Anderson trophy. Bell is as humble as they come.



""I have been here for four years and I have never been on a team like this"" Bell said.



""I love these guys. This is really a special feeling.""



He then stopped talking for a few seconds and added: ""I'm at a loss for words right now.""







Bell was joined by catcher Brock Gagliardi who had three hits Sunday; outfielder Andy Garriola and pitcher Hunter Gregory on the all-tournament team.



Gariolla hit three home runs in Friday's victory over Florida Atlantic. The Monarchs who lead the nation with 101 home runs hit 14 dingers in their four tournament games including seven against FAU.



ODU will find out where it will play at noon Sunday when the 64-team bracket is unveiled on ESPN2.



The Monarchs got on a double-decker sleeper bus around 8 p.m. and hope complete the 1095-mile ride in time to watch the NCAA pairings show in Norfolk.



Where will the Monarchs play? It all depends on seeding.



I hope the Monarchs head to East Carolina which is 2 ½ hours from Norfolk close enough for fans to make the drive.



However Aaron Fitt from D1Baseball one of the most connected college baseball reporters wrote that he expects ODU will be a No. 1 seed and so likely will ECU.



Because the NCAA won't put two No. a seeds in the same region he expects ODU will play at South Carolina which will be a No. 2 seed.



Columbia South Carolina is a 5 ½-hour drive from Norfolk. And while the Gamecocks lost four of their last five games it plays in the SEC which is even more dominant in baseball than it is in football.



Finwood said the partisan crowd in Ruston – the Monarchs finished the regular season at LA Tech with two games last week – ""really helped prepare us for what we'll see next week. Every game here LA Tech had great crowds.



""Wherever we go the home team will have a lot of support.""



Battle said the Monarchs don't really care where they end up playing.



""We'll be excited to play wherever they put us"" he said.



After all as he said this team still has much more to accomplish.

Tech stuns Southern Miss with two walk-off wins advances to C-USA championship game - The Vicksburg Post,"La. Tech stuns Southern Miss with two walk-off wins advances to C-USA championship game Published 11:40 pm Saturday May 29 2021

RUSTON La. — A stunning loss ended Southern Miss’ winning streak in the Conference USA baseball tournament. Another a few hours later ended its reign as champion.

Louisiana Tech rallied from an eight-run deficit to beat Southern Miss 11-10 to survive in an elimination game Saturday afternoon. Then on Saturday night the Bulldogs scored four runs in the bottom of the ninth inning — the last two on a walk-off single by Phillip Matulia — to win 6-5 and advance to the C-USA championship game for the first time.

Louisiana Tech (40-17) will face Old Dominion (41-14) Sunday at 1 p.m. on CBS Sports Network in a matchup of two teams looking to end long championship droughts.

Louisiana Tech has not won a conference tournament since 1987 when it was in the Southland Conference. Old Dominion is making its first appearance in the championship game since joining Conference USA in 2013. It has not won a conference tournament since 1996 when it was in the Colonial Athletic Association.

Southern Miss had an eight-game C-USA Tournament winning streak snapped as well as its three-year reign as C-USA champion. It’s the first time since 2015 that the Golden Eagles have failed to reach the C-USA tournament championship game after they won it all in 2016 2018 and 2019 and lost in the 2017 title game. There was no tournament in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Southern Miss (37-19) is still one of 20 schools vying to host 16 NCAA Tournament regionals as is Louisiana Tech. The regional sites will be announced Sunday evening and the full 64-team NCAA Tournament field will be released Monday at 11 a.m. on ESPN2.

Louisiana Tech needed to beat Southern Miss twice on Saturday to reach the championship game and did it with two improbable comebacks.

Christopher Sargent homered twice and drove in five runs and Danny Lynch went 2-for-5 with a solo home run as Southern Miss built an 8-0 lead after four innings in the first game Saturday.

From the fifth inning on however Louisiana Tech flipped the momentum 180 degrees. It scored six runs on five hits in the fifth inning to get back in the game added two more in the seventh and finally took a 10-9 lead in the eightg on a sacrifice fly by Steele Netterville.

Lynch hit the second pitch of the ninth inning over the center field fence to tie the game at 10 but Louisiana Tech wound up winning it in extra innings. Hunter Wells drew a one-out walk in the 10th inning and after a fly out Wells scored on a double by Netterville to give the Bulldogs an 11-10 victory.

Game two was a pitcher’s duel until both offenses exploded during a wild final two innings.

Manny Garcia hit a solo home run in the bottom of the eighth — part of a 5-for-5 night that tied a C-USA Tournament single-game record for most hits — to put Louisiana Tech ahead 2-1.

In the top of the ninth Southern Miss turned to a pair of unlikely heroes to take the lead. Little-used freshman Slade Wilks hit a pinch-hit three-run home run and Brady Faust hit a sacrifice fly to put the Golden Eagles ahead 5-2.

Wilks has only played in about half of the Golden Eagles’ 56 games this season and entered with a .157 batting average. He also hit a game-tying three-run home run against Louisiana Tech on April 18.

Wilks had 51 at-bats in 27 games entering Saturday. Faust another freshman had five at-bats in 18 games.

Their contributions though wound up being a footnote to a wild finish.

Louisiana Tech scored a pair of runs in the bottom of the ninth on a sacrifice fly by Netterville and a bloop single by Cole MCConnell. Another single by Garcia and a walk to Jorge Corona on a full-count pitch loaded the bases with two outs.

That brought up Matulia who also worked a full count. He lined a pitch into right field a step in front of USM’s Reece Ewing and pinch-runner Adarius Myers and McConnell both scored easily to give the Bulldogs their second walk-off win of the day.

Louisiana Tech and Southern Miss played 11 times this season. Tech won seven of them including the last three on walk-off hits. Seven of the 11 games were decided by one run.

The schools hosting regionals will be Arizona Arkansas East Carolina Florida Louisiana Tech Mississippi Mississippi State Notre Dame Oregon South Carolina Stanford Tennessee Texas Texas Christian Texas Tech and Vanderbilt. The full bracket for the NCAA Tournament will be released Monday at noon.

The 16 sites for regionals were chosen from a shortlist of 20 potential hosts that the selection committee announced earlier this month. The four schools from the initial list not to end up hosting regionals are Charlotte Gonzaga Pittsburgh and Southern Mississippi.

While the shortlist had a few surprises in it at the time the same cannot be said of the final 16 hosts. They match the most recent projection from Baseball America.

The selection process for host sites changed this year to accommodate the need to create a coronavirus testing lab at each host site. The process to set the lab up and ensure it is operating correctly takes longer than the typical five-day notice host sites get so the selection committee needed to pick host sites a few weeks early.

While South Carolina is hosting it is not expected to be a No. 1 seed in its regional. Old Dominion which on Sunday won the Conference USA Tournament and has a top-10 RPI will likely be the top seed in the Columbia Regional. The Monarchs did not bid to host regionals this year.

A traveling No. 1 seed would be unconventional in the modern version of the NCAA Tournament. The selection committee has not sent a top seed on the road since 2010 when Florida State was the No. 1 seed in the Norwich Regional hosted by Connecticut. It previously was a more common part of the NCAA Tournament but as more schools have invested more money in their facilities more schools have met the hosting requirements.

It will also be interesting to see if a second traveling No. 1 seed is used this year. Oklahoma State did not earn a spot on the shortlist of 20 sites but could still earn a No. 1 seed with a win in the Big 12 Tournament championship game against Texas Christian. In that case the Cowboys could be the top seed in the Ruston Regional."

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.

In a major attempt at overhauling domestic chip production the United States Senate agreed to end debate on Thursday on an amendment introduced by the Democratic party Senator Chuck Schumer. This amendment covers a broad array of topics from the semiconductor supply chain to aeronautics but it starts by appropriating funds from the United States Department of Treasury to the Department of Commerce for funding the Creating Helpful Incentives To Produce Semiconductors For America (CHIPS) section of the 2021 National Defense Authorisation Act (NDAA).

The CHIPS Act authorizes the Commerce Department to engage the private sector in developing leading-edge chip manufacturing processes. It has gained widespread attention due to the rise of Taiwan's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).

U.S. Innovation and Competition Act Focuses On Advanced and Mature Semiconductor Process Nodes

The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) amendment is a substitute amendment for the Endless Frontier Act which the Senate is currently evaluating before a final vote is called to pass it. Senator Schumer introduced it earlier this month and the body agreed to close debate on it on Thursday.

Following this the amendment referred to as S.1502 is being considered by the Senate alongside the complete Endless Frontier Act Bill. While neither the bill nor the amendment has been passed the fact that a bipartisan group of senators agreed on ending debate for S.1502 is a positive development that might result in it being cleared and being sent to the House of Representatives before landing on President Biden's desk to become public law.

The USICA's salient point when it comes to the semiconductor industry is authorizing $39 billion in funds for the CHIPS Act. Specifically the funds are reserved for Section 9902 of the Act which authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to work with entities interested in setting up chip fabrication and packaging facilities inside the United States. Importantly under Section 9902 individual projects will not secure federal funds above $3 billion. So assuming that no exceptions are made the funds authorized by USICA should provide coverage for 13 individual projects.

$39 Billion Allocated For Direct Chip Manufacturing Support

However the funds are not authorized for a single fiscal year. Instead the amendment allocates funding over five fiscal years with the first tranche covering investment for the next fiscal year set to start in October this year. The funding for Section 9902 allocated to each fiscal year is as follows:

$19 billion for the fiscal year 2022

$5 billion for the fiscal year 2023

$5 billion for the fiscal year 2024

$5 billion for the fiscal year 2025

$5 billion for the fiscal year 2026

While the $39 billion is allocated for direct investment into chip fabrication as a whole the USICA authorizes roughly $50 billion for the chip sector. In addition to funding Section 9902 it also funds Section 9906 of the CHIPS Act.

Subsection (c) of this section directs the Secretary of Commerce to coordinate with the Secretary of Defense to establish a National Semiconductor Technology Center. This center will also support new ventures and collaboration between the public and private sectors for developing the 3-nanometer semiconductor process node.

For subsection (c) specifically the USICA allocates $2 billion for the next fiscal year. Thus as a whole $5 billion in funds for Section 9906 will be available during FY2022 with $2.5 billion going towards funding subsection (d) and $500 million for (e) and (f).

Subsections (d) (e) and (f) respectively deal with chip packaging microelectronics research and the establishment of the Manufacturing USA institute dedicated towards chipmaking machines and other areas.

The next generation of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines to manufacture chips will use larger lens apertures to focus more light on wafers for printing semiconductors. This brings its own unique sets of problems since the higher magnification results in 'half' patterns being printed. Image: ASML

After FY2022 the USICA appropriates the following amounts for Section 9906 of the CHIPS Act:

$2 billion for the fiscal year 2023

$1.3 billion for the fiscal year 2024

$1.1 billion for the fiscal year 2025

$1.8 billion for the fiscal year 2026

Finally while the bulk of the amendment focuses on the latest chip technologies it also allocates $2 billion in the next fiscal year to develop mature technology nodes. These funds will be used to build test assemble and/or package mature semiconductor products. While the consumer electronics sector relies on the latest technologies such as the 5 nanometer and 7-nanometer nodes the older processes are used for various sectors including defense and automotive.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6b20uY29tL2FydGljbGUuYXNweD9BcnRpY2xlSUQ9MjA0NjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maskless Lithography and 3D Integration,"Several megatrends are shaping contemporary digital society and these in turn are driving the continuous development and expanding capabilities of lithographic patterning equipment for semiconductor manufacturing.

2D-IC density scaling is beginning to reach its cost limits particularly in the case of patterning processes. As these limits are reached advances in miniaturization and device performance continue to extend towards 3D integration and heterogeneous integration (HI) within advanced packaging.

This novel approach is regarded as a central factor in the development of next-generation devices whereby the advent of mobile processors has prompted an initial growth cycle in 3D/HI. It is anticipated that this growth cycle will continue as high-performance applications such as 5G and artificial intelligence (AI) become more commonplace in mobile devices. Other drivers include megatrends such as autonomous driving and the Internet of Things (IoT) both of which require high reliability and data network capacity.

Over the years advanced packaging technologies have become more complex and varied with 3D integration enabling a shift from single to multi-die packaging. This is just one example of addressing the challenge of managing the substantial amounts of data generated by high-performance computing.

Continuous innovation in chiplet design coupled with an ever-expanding range of integration schemes (either on silicon embedded or in package) may now include several patterning levels. Design flexibility has become increasingly important and the industry now demands shorter development cycles along with the ability to accommodate a wide range of advanced packaging platforms simultaneously. This has necessitated the adoption of both die and wafer-level designs simultaneously during back-end lithographic processing.

Any advanced product design mix will add multiple masking levels meaning that masks and mask inventory/cleanroom storage represent a considerable fraction of overall production costs. Replacement parts for conventional laser sources or Hg lamps may also incur high costs.

Wait times for new physical mask sets and complex proof-of-new-design concepts for high product-mix designs can result in prolonged development cycles when working in conventional mask-based production environments.

These critical needs in semiconductor packaging have prompted the development of EVG’s maskless exposure (MLE™) technology. MLE™ technology offers design flexibility while simultaneously enabling unique scalability in both development and production facilities reducing development cycles between the R&D and production phase through the elimination of consumable costs and mask-related difficulties.

This novel technology offers high-resolution (<2 µm L/S) stitch-free and dynamically addressable exposure of the entire substrate surface therefore enabling agile processing and ensuring low cost of ownership (CoO).

Limitations of Traditional Exposure Methods

The resolution of any optical imaging system is fundamentally defined by the ratio of exposure wavelength and its numerical aperture (NA). NA determines the light-gathering and light-emitting potential through the lens which is characterized by the angle of aperture and therefore dependent on focal length.

Alteration of NA in exposure systems is technically more cost effective than shortening the light source’s UV wavelength. Imaging exposure systems like steppers are generally driven towards higher NA thus enabling structuring of finer critical dimensions.

Conversely higher NA will reduce the depth of focus. It is therefore important to find a balance between resolution and focal depth in terms of the interconnect circuit design. This is essential in advanced packaging because the reconstitution of wafers is a central factor in integrating die from different wafer manufacturers in a multi-die solution.

As well as the aforementioned physical limitations further difficulties arise due to inaccuracies from the variations in die placement and die shift caused by over-molding. Current lithography steppers and other mask-based systems often struggle to manage these difficulties.

The given reticle size and optical dimensions of static exposure systems result in limits to the exposure area. This can be especially challenging when working with larger die interposer fabrication because stitch lines or mismatched overlap regions of reticle exposure fields have the potential to adversely affect electrical properties within the redistribution layer (RDL).

When working with advanced devices with the complex layouts needed for advanced graphics processing high-performance computing (HPC) and AI it is important to be able to generate a stitch-less pattern for interposers that exceeds the size of current reticles.

MLE™ meets these needs via a distinct combination of sub-nanometer range stage motion accuracy real time patterning of a vector-based mask file and powerful distortion-free high-intensity optics. Other approaches that must rasterize the mask image before patterning will generate approximately 141 GB of data for each 300 mm wafer.

Figure 1. Critical dimension versus focus position for DoF process window evaluation. Image Credit: EV Group

The digital mask pattern is projected onto the substrate surface with sub-µs timing accuracy. The MLE™ imaging system is diffraction-limited much like the majority of modern lenses. It supports a depth of focus (DoF) of ±12 µm. Figure 1 shows a measurement of the DoF process window performance at 2 µm L/S along with the simulated curve.

The usable dynamic focused range is extended to more than 100 µm thanks to the exposure window the relatively small exposure field and the <1 µm precise autofocus. Bowed and warped substrates can be easily compensated for due to the system’s ability to control the focus position on a larger scale of the wafer position via chuck positioning and wafer clamping.

Dynamic Exposure Methods and Active Die-Shift Compensation

Current back-end lithographic systems are unable to control distortions that are smaller than the exposure field. These systems will therefore struggle with non-linear high-order substrate distortions and die-shift-related issues particularly following die reconstitution on the wafer.

To adapt to surface variations and the substrate material MLE™ utilizes dynamic alignment modes with an automatic focus. Advanced distortion functionality relates and analyzes real-time data from synchronized visible or near-infrared topside and backside alignment. It achieves this by actively compensating for mechanical die placement high-order distortions of the substrate and other stress-induced inaccuracies such as rotation displacement and expansion.

Figure 2. Advanced distortion compensation schematic process flow. Image Credit: EV Group

Figure 2 provides a visualization of the process flow of the advanced distortion correction function and dynamic alignment modes. Dynamic alignment features global and multi-point wafer alignment options typically enabling up to 16 alignment marks (marked with blue and yellow) to be randomly placed in the layout. This allows the instrument to comprehensively cover the most critical areas on the substrate while also compensating for global distortions.

Once misalignment measurement has been completed displacement vectors will be further compiled in parallel prior to the design being interpolated and rendered in real-time. These exposed patterns will be fully error compensated without inducing overlapping or non-covered regions therefore ensuring minimal misalignment with no impact on the throughput of the patterning process.

The example shown here presents a visualization of a compensated layout (dark grey) following an extreme atypical misalignment (indicated with red arrows). This is a result of compensating the actual position of 16 marks (yellow) of multi-point alignment using the dynamic alignment mode.

When working with bonded opaque substrates or other non-transparent materials common in multi-layer and multi-die processing backside alignment will play a considerable role. Referencing the same structure for multiple exposures will also help minimize misalignment as the density of current pattern design increases.

Overlay errors or any kind of misalignment will affect the electrical properties of contacts and insulation and these may also result in connection failures that significantly impact fab yield CoO and overall productivity.

Figure 3. Schematic drawing of top and bottom-side alignment objectives. Image Credit: EV Group

Systems fitted with MLE™ technology generally integrate full wafer backside alignment (Figure 3) employing dedicated objectives with near IR capability and proprietary chuck design to accommodate wafer sizes up to 300 mm.

Die distortion errors induced after reconstitution on the wafer are typical when working with FOWLP. In these cases advanced distortion functionality should be applied at the die level with active compensation and rerouting results relying solely on external metrology data.

Distortion compensation algorithms will typically include mathematical correction of scale rotation shear and translation (shift). When addressing die-placement-error compensation the model will limit distortions within the dies to the rigid body of the die. This is generally represented by two (external) alignment points per die.

Figure 4. Die-level compensation schematic process flow. Image Credit: EV Group

The immediacy of the conversion process means that dynamic binary pattern generation will complement externally acquired metrology data for each die. This is done individually per substrate just prior to exposure in order to compensate for overlay/positioning errors resulting from handling or pre-processing excluding potential thermal influences. Figure 4 visualizes a simplified data integrity flow of die-level compensation.

MLE™ patterning facilitates the real-time individualized wafer-level layouts and simultaneous structuring of individual die layouts. This is particularly useful when working with ad hoc die annotations functional and directly readable encryption codes serial numbers active fuse map patterning to optimize device binning for process or device tracking and documentation. This will also ultimately lead to improved overall yield.

Programmable modulations of UV dosage at the sub-pixel level allow the use of exposure gradients. These are used for controlled resist-thickness-level variations following the development process - also known as greyscale lithography. This approach effectively facilitates the fabrication of complex 3D multi-level resist patterns highly suited to multiple patterning processes MEMS devices dual damascene and both refractive and diffractive micro-optical elements.

The digital programmable die/wafer layout may be stored in a range of industry standard layout design file formats; for example Gerber GDSII Oasis ODB++ or BMP. Because the layout is computationally processed on the system under recipe control factors such as resist type (positive/negative) exposure dose level or design layout complexity will not impact the speed of the patterning process.

Patterning Modularity and Vital Positioning in Sub-Grid

MLE’s resolution makes it suitable for typical back-end-of-line resolutions with fine control of the irradiated lines as well as their gaps (L/S <2 µm). It can accommodate these resolutions while maintaining CD uniformity (CDU <10% CD) and positional accuracy of any arbitrary structures present in a 248 nm patterning grid scale.

Distortion-free optics and stage placement accuracy help to ensure seamless projection across the whole substrate. The exposure may be conducted with highly flexible intensity control and precise light-source-spectrum tuning. These factors allow users to achieve optimal absorption and reliable processing when working with a wide range of commercially available and novel photoresists.

The exposure light source functions at a wavelength spectrum of 375 nm and 405 nm. This facilitates a mix and match approach using wavelengths to mimic known-good-process recipes (for example to follow the traditional mercury lamp spectrum) or to customize the exposure according to specific customer demands.

It is possible to apply both wavelengths simultaneously to any arbitrary mixture enabling thin-resist patterning including positive negative patternable dielectrics polyimide dry film or even PCB materials. It is also possible to support thick resist exposures at high aspect ratios such as those commonly found in wafer-level packaging microfluidics 3D MEMS patterning and integrated photonics applications.

Figure 5 (top) includes a number of SEM images showing standard line-space resolution targets on 1 µm thick positive AZ MIR 701 resist. Figure 5 (bottom) shows line-space resolution tests on 2 µm thick negative tone resist AZ nLOF. In each case a 1.5 µm L/S result was achieved via additional process optimization.

This optimization involved the reduction of surface reflection effects achieved through the application of anti-reflective coatings or the modification of substrate material properties.

The MLE™ technology can also be used to finely control depth of focus (DoF) order achieving steep sidewalls and therefore maintaining the desired 3D contour of the resist preventing edge topping or avoiding footing. Significant working distance coupled with automatic adaptive focus help ensure patterning uniformity across the exposure surface.

In order to demonstrate a range of line and spacing patterning performance as well as sidewall patterning quality a commonly utilized TOK P-W1000T resist for fine-line and core-line RDL creation was selected.

Maskless Operation Scalability

Back-end lithography results achieved during R&D via direct imaging equipment have historically lacked the technological resilience to properly function with high-volume-manufacturing (HVM) lines fitted with steppers. The industry is seeing an ever-expanding product mix – for example chiplets and segmented dies – and this is proving to be a driver for continued performance scaling and increasing variability of applications.

These factors have prompted an increasing need for dynamic patterning at various resist thicknesses and dose levels. MLE™ can provide a high DoF at 2 µm production resolution effectively leveraging the physical diffraction limit established by the optics.

MLE™ is also highly scalable with its modular system scaling according to user needs through the addition of UV exposure heads (Figure 7). This facilitates a rapid transition from R&D to HVM mode effectively accommodating throughput optimization or adaptation to different substrate sizes and materials. MLE™ is ideal for processing a range of substrates ranging from small silicon or compound semiconductor wafers up to panel sizes.

Summary

MLE™ technology provides a novel approach to patterning offering smart and agile digital processing and delivering a consumable-free infrastructure and maskless scalability in terms of throughput and format.

MLE™ can achieve the same high patterning performance regardless of photoresist. It achieves this thanks to a flexible reliable and scalable high-power UV laser source combination that can accommodate multiple wavelength options.

The platform facilitates patterning of a wide range of materials using the same optics; for example silicon glass mold polymers and laminates. The wafer chuck and autofocus system can compensate for substrate bow and warp an especially important consideration in applications such as FOWLP.

The technology provides virtually unlimited design flexibility opening up the currently conservative environment to new innovations helping to shorten development cycles and bridging the gap between R&D and HVM.

Located at the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology in Nyeri County 60 miles east of Kenya’s capital Nairobi Semiconductor Technologies Limited will set the pace for local electronic chip manufacturing.

Other devices that the company will manufacture are mobile phones and television sets which will be sold locally and internationally according to its owners.

The facility has been constructed through a public-private partnership between the university and 4Wave Inc a nanotechnology firm based in Sterling Virginia the United States.

Twenty students of the Masters in Science and Engineering program at the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology have been allowed to work in the company built at the university’s Science and Technology Park.

Ben Kinyua one of the beneficiary students said the opportunity to work for Semiconductor Technologies Limited is a dream come true.

“We have a platform to show the world that Kenya and Africa at large are rising in technology” he told Zenger News. “This opportunity will give us a platform to exploit and showcase our technological skills.”

Another student Stephen Kiprop 30 said he never imagined that one day his name would go in history books as one of the pioneers of the nanotechnology and semiconductors industry in Africa.

“We are ready to prove to the world that we can do it” Kiprop told Zenger News.

Speaking during the company’s official launch on April 26 2021 Kenya’s President Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta said that the company—built during the Covid-19 pandemic—will rely on local expertise.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vYm9yZ2VucHJvamVjdC5vcmcvZ2xvYmFsLWNoaXAtc2hvcnRhZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How COVID-19 Created a Global Chip Shortage,"The COVID-19 pandemic created a global chip shortage that has ultimately exacerbated poverty. Most notably the tech divide has widened as economic sanctions worldwide slowed production or halted it entirely leaving many out of work. Fortunately countries and manufacturers are stepping up to address the pandemic-induced global chip shortage.

The Cause of the Global Chip Shortage

Chips are known as the “brains” of electronic devices and are essential to several industries including the cellphone industry and the motor vehicle industry. The shortage initially began because of a delay in production caused by factories shutting down due to the emergence of the COVID-19 virus in 2020. Simultaneously remote work increased the demand for telecommunication ultimately creating a strain on the supply and demand ratio.

The U.S.-China tech war also played a major factor in the global chip shortage. The U.S. Department of Commerce blacklisted SMIC which is one of the largest semiconductor manufacturers in Asia. The inability to source U.S.-based parts to manufacture small chips had significant ramifications for the supply chain. Several companies including Huawei Technologies Co. had anticipated such actions and began stockpiling chips as early as 2019.

Effects on the Global Economy

The chip shortage has harshly impacted several East Asian countries largely because 75% of global semiconductor chips are produced in East Asia. Because of COVID-19 2020 saw a $2.1 trillion revenue loss across Asia putting an estimated 23 million individuals out of work.

The U.N. realized the economic strife that the COVID-19 pandemic brought upon the world. The U.N. predicted that 71 million individuals globally would be “pushed back into extreme poverty in 2020.” The pandemic even put previously financially secure individuals at risk of poverty.

Several motor vehicle manufacturers including Ford Nissan Toyota and Honda halted production at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. When the companies eventually increased their semiconductor chip orders suppliers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) could not keep up. Due to the impact of chip shortages Ford failed to produce upwards of 1.1 million cars giving way to a potential $2.5 billion loss.

Chip Shortage Impact on the Tech Divide

Almost 60% of the global population has access to the internet with Europe and Asia leading the highest internet penetration rates in 2020. China has around 854 million internet users out of a 1.4 billion population. In lower-income countries however internet penetration rates are far lower.

The COVID-19 pandemic created the global chip shortage which in turn caused high inflation. A significant factor in widening the tech divide is the high cost. GPUs PS5s and Xboxes have skyrocketed in value with some products tripling in price in a little over a year. For example the Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti graphics card had seen an increased retail price of $399 to a street price of $1226 by March 2021. These higher prices create barriers to internet access and other technological abilities for those in lower-income countries thereby exacerbating the digital divide.

Resolving the Shortage

In order to address the global chip shortage in February 2021 President Biden signed an executive order to expand semiconductor chip production within the United States. The U.S. accounts for 47% of the world’s semiconductor chip sales yet just 12% of all chip manufacturing. In order to solve the shortage Biden sought “$37 billion in funding for legislation to supercharge chip manufacturing in the United States.”

In April 2021 TSMC announced a plan to invest $100 billion in chips over the next three years to address the global chip shortfall. In 2020 TSMC spent around $17 billion in producing semiconductor chips and originally only planned to spend between $25-28 billion for 2021. The budget changed to account for the shortfall and the increased demand in telecommunications.

The global chip shortage is projected to linger until 2023. Despite this prolonged shortfall many companies look forward to operating at full capacity as COVID-19 vaccines become more globally available and the global chip shortage decreases.

This particular factory is in charge of building Nissan’s Versa Kicks and March.But at the same time the Japanese firm also plans to halt the operations at Plant 2 as well though this time the whole thing would only happen for one day. The manufacturing of the Nissan Sentra is expected to be affected by the production adjustments.And last but not least Nissan confirmed its CIVAC plant in Morelos will go offline for seven days as well.And it’s all because the Japanese company doesn’t have enough chips to install on its cars. The global semiconductor shortage has already made plenty of victims in the automotive industry with large companies turning to similar production adjustments as they wait for suppliers to deliver more chips.The worse news is that nobody knows for sure when exactly the crisis is supposed to come to an end. Industry experts warn the lack of chips is very likely to continue in 2022 with some signs of recovery to be recorded in the first quarters of the next year.Meanwhile research shows that the production of over 4 million cars could be affected by the semiconductor shortage with the number expected to grow by the end of the year unless foundries found a way to manufacture more chips and ship them on time to help avoid more halts.

Next week's headline event marking the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre was canceled suddenly Thursday with organizers citing ""unexpected circumstances with entertainers and speakers.""

In a statement the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission didn't specify the circumstances that led to the cancellation of the event scheduled for Monday at ONEOK Field in Tulsa. The commission statement held out hope that it might be rescheduled later this year.

""Due to unexpected circumstances with entertainers and speakers the Centennial Commission is unable to fulfill our high expectations for Monday afternoon's commemoration event and has determined not to move forward with the event at this time"" the statement said.

The commission says on its website it aims to ""leverage the rich history surrounding the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre by facilitating actions activities and events that commemorate and educate all citizens."" It had enlisted Grammy-award-winning singer and songwriter John Legend to headline the ""Remember & Rise"" event. Voting rights activist Stacey Abrams was to deliver the keynote address.

The event was to be televised nationwide and 6000 people were expected to attend.

On May 27 2021 Darius Kirk looks at a mural depicting the Tulsa Race Massacre in the historic Greenwood neighborhood ahead of centennial commemorations of the massacre in Tulsa Oklahoma. The area originally known as Black Wall Street was destroyed a hundred years ago when a murderous white mob laid waste to what was the nation's most prosperous Black-owned business district and residential neighborhood. John Locher / AP

""Remember & Rise"" was to highlight a year of events the commission organized to educate people about the attack by a white mob that experts say killed up to 300 people most of them Black.

CBS News learned the event was canceled after a lawyer representing the survivors and their heirs made requests that the organizing commission considered unreasonable. There are three living survivors of the massacre — 107 106 and 100 years old.

Multiple sources shared an email with CBS News that the lawyer Demario Solomon-Simmons sent to the commission last Sunday. In the email Solomon-Simmons accused the chair of the commission of attacking ""the credibility and integrity of our survivors."" The email went on to say: ""As a result this is where we are and/or what we need in order to come to an agreement at this point.""

The first request that was listed — of several — was $1 million per survivor which the attorney described as a ""priority for us.""

The second request was a $50 million pledge to ""our Survivor and Descendant fund."" The attorney stated that after conferring with advisors ""we will not agree with any other entity housing our fund. This is non-negotiable. It is important to us and our community that our fund be housed at a Black bank.""

The attorney also noted that they plan to announce their fund at a ""nationally-streamed Survivor and Descendant Town Hall"" on May 31 ""with an initial fundraising goal of $100M.""

A commission source told CBS News the commission and a lawyer representing the survivors had already agreed on financial terms but the new requests couldn't be met at least in time for Monday's commemoration.

The lawyer claimed to CBS News that the commission hasn't been negotiating in good faith for months and he maintained that the survivors never agreed to participate in the event.

The chair of the Centennial Commission Oklahoma State Senator Kevin Matthews said at a press conference Friday that the group had agreed to $100000 per living survivor. He also said the group pledged $2 million to the reparations fund discussed with the attorney and that the money had been raised.

""So to be clear I absolutely want the survivors the descendants and others that were affected to be financially and emotionally supported"" Matthews said according to CBS Tulsa affiliate KOTV. ""However this is not the way no matter how hard we try. We do have the funds and if the legal team doesn't bar us from it again we will be providing those funds directly to the survivors.""

In a statement published by KOTV Solomon-Simmons said:

""After months of zero communication and under immense pressure that John Legend and Stacey Abrams may no longer participate if the survivors were not centered a meeting was scheduled for Saturday. Immediately following that call our legal team submitted a written list of seven requests to ensure the survivors participation with the Commission's scheduled events. WE revisited that list of requests on yet another Zoom call on Tuesday. The agreement was to have answers on each of the requests by COB. That didn't happen.""

""There was never a non-negotiable demand for $50 million dollars. The non-negotiable issues were that the fund would provide direct financial support to survivors and descendants that the fund would be administered by descendants and community members and the fund be held in a Black bank. The Justice for Greenwood Foundation whose board includes descendants and community members has already established a fund. Nevertheless we were willing to explore details of the fund's administration so long as the fund continued to be overseen by a majority of descendants and community members.""

""We have turned our attention to raising money for them ourselves and on our scheduled events. We have three remaining survivors. They will be heard. They will live with grace and dignity. The time for justice is now.""

In a statement late Thursday the project director of the Centennial Commission Phil Armstrong said the panel was disappointed but encouraged people to visit other events taking place in Tulsa this weekend.

""We are disappointed in this last minute change but there is still so much to look forward to this weekend and we are still so proud of the work of the Commission over the past five years"" Armstrong said. ""I hope you'll join us at the Candlelight Vigil at the Pathway to Hope at one of the many great events other community organizations are hosting and of course at Greenwood Rising.""

Greenwood Rising is a 7000-square-foot museum nearing completion that's located in the Greenwood District and tells the story of Black Wall Street and the race massacre.

Violence erupted May 31 and June 1 in 1921 when a white mob killed an estimated 300 people and wounded 800 most of them Black while burning 30 blocks of Black-owned businesses and homes and neighborhood churches in the Greenwood neighborhood also known as "" Black Wall Street."" Planes were even used to drop explosives on the area burning it to the ground.

A renewed search for bodies in 2020 found at least 12 in an unmarked mass grave in a Tulsa cemetery. A team led by Oklahoma's state archaeologist hasn't identified the bodies or confirmed they were victims of the massacre. But they were found in an area adjacent to two gravestones of victims and where old funeral home records show both identified and unidentified victims were buried.

The following is the text of the email that Demario Solomon-Simmons sent to the commission last Sunday:

Good evening Everyone

First thank you for your time yesterday. Please know that we thought the meeting was productive. Leaving the meeting we were cautiously optimistic that an agreement could be reached which would allow us to have a more unified Centennial commemoration. However finding out today that Sen. Kevin Matthews Chair of the Centennial Commission attacked the credibility and integrity of our survivors has set-us back some.

As a result this is where we are and/or what we need in order to come to an agreement at this point:

1. $1M per survivor. We believe you understand this is a priority for us. We believe you understand there is a great sense of urgency. We understood that you are going to visit with the Commission/TCF/Funders to ascertain how much you can commit to providing to the survivors before May 31st 2021.

2. $50M pledge to our Survivor and Descendant fund.

a. After debriefing with our advisors we have decided we will not agree with any other entity housing our fund. This is non-negotiable. It is important to us and our community that our fund be housed at a Black bank.

b. As I explained during our meeting we have been working with our corporate counsel Schulte Roth and Zable (including William Zable) and our mentor Bryan Stevenson of the Equal Justice Initiative to develop our fund. With Bryan's counsel we have identified 6 Black banks that we are currently in discussions with about the possibility of holding our fund.

c. With the help of our national partners we plan to announce our fund at our May 31st 2021nationally-streamed Survivor and Descendant Town Hall with an initial fundraising goal of $100M.

d. We request that the Commission/TCF/Funders pledge to raise $50M for our fund. If you agree to this we would like for you to specify a date you plan to have this amount raised by.

3. Allot 33% of Greenwood Rising revenue to directly benefit survivors and descendants and the North Tulsa community. We understand you believe this ask is high. However we understand you will visit with the Commission/TCF/Funder to ascertain what type of revenue split would be acceptable to you. We also understand that you would agree to make a public announcement to work towards establishing a TIF district for the Historical Greenwood community that would directly and specifically benefit North Tulsa.

4. Greenwood Rising board make-up. We understand that you are going to ascertain whether the Commission/TCF/Funders will agree to expand the board by 6 to 15 and allow us to select those 6 new members.

5. Public Support of Lawsuit. We understand that you will visit with the Commission/TCF/Funders to ascertain whether you all will publicly support our litigation and efforts to hold the perpetrators of the Massacre and its aftermath accountable.

6. Public apology from Commission Chairman Sen. Matthews for Attacking Survivors.

a. Sen. Matthews must immediately and publicly apologize for his inaccurate portrayal of the survivors his misrepresentation of the proposed gift from GKFF and our campaign for justice and reparations in the media. https://www.enidnews.com/news/last-tulsa-race-massacre-survivors-push-for-reparations/article_cf550c14-ba7c-11eb-b273-872233bcb49b.html.

b. GKFF and I agreed that any gift would be strictly anonymous to ensure the gift would not impede our larger reparations campaign. In fact the grant agreement specifically states the grant would be ""anonymous and not be announced in an way publicly or privately."" Obviously this confidential agreement was breached and the proposed gift is now being used to try to put the survivors in a false light to lessen their credibility and undermine our overall reparations fight. As a result we will decline the grant.

c. Sen. Matthews needs to clearly state that no Commission donor has given any funds to Justice For Greenwood or the Survivors. Despite what Sen. Matthews and others have falsely stated there was never an agreement to provide for the survivors ""for the rest of their life"" or ""all of their medical needs."" Sen. Matthews' public apology and clarification must occur by the end of business tomorrow Monday May 24 2021.

7. Rise and Remember Event. If we can get to an agreement on the above we would also want to help shape the program of the Rise and Remember event at ONEOK Field occurring on May 31 2021. We want an opportunity to speak and honor the survivors and our work.

In regard to timing because our events begin Thursday May 27th 2021 and our schedules will be completely swamped from then on we believe that we need to have an agreement on the above points by Wednesday May 26th 2021. As a result we believe we should schedule our next meeting for tomorrow afternoon Monday May 24th 2021. We are available between 3-5pm.

Please let us know what time will work for you. Dr. Crutcher will be in Dallas for a speech so a Zoom call is preferable. Lastly we request that until and unless we can get to an agreement please remove any refence of survivors participating in any Commission events from your website.

Thank you.

Only a year ago Profit had demanded action around the depreciation of cookies.

“As part of an ongoing effort to evolve beyond our core media services we are engaged in a range of exclusive partnerships across data technology audiences content and e-commerce ” said Farhan Khan CEO of Brainchild which has a non-ownership franchising agreement with the Publicis Groupe to use the trademarks of Starcom and Mediavest. “Our goal is to stay ahead of the industry and offer our clients media solutions that drive actional business outcomes while also delivering meaningful human experiences.”

An extension of a long-standing relationship between the two companies this partnership expands to incorporate data services in the form of exclusive partnerships to an extended list of media services already managed by Starcom including media planning and media buying for multiple media touchpoints along with integrated marketing communications special events content opportunities for multi-touch attribution amongst other services.

“Its always a good initiative to be collecting data on publishers or digital media providers as we as a market are still far behind in terms of data-driven decision making so I only see a benefit to their clients in the future” said Muhammed Ibrahim the CEO of Giraffe. “And if this is an automated collection then it’s a winner!”

Through partnerships with Google and Oracle Brainchild is credited with being the first agency in Pakistan to run multiple successful pilots of 2nd party data campaigns and is currently the largest 2nd party data hub in Pakistan. On the back of a recent success case with Mondelez the media agency is building a second-party data marketplace through initial partnerships with UrduPoint and HamariWeb the top two publisher sites in Pakistan based on Alexa rankings.

“You might purchase this type of data to add scale to your first-party data” said a spokesperson from Lotame. “Although first-party data is of high quality if your audience is small you might not be able to reach the scale you are hoping for with your campaigns. Supplementing it with similar data from a second party can make your campaigns go further with no questions of quality.”

When an organization collects straight from its audience and then sells directly to another company it is called second-party data. As with the recently published case study for Mondelez the second-party data collected from UrduPoint and HamariWeb was blended with the first-party data collected from a Cadbury Generosity website.

“This is a very welcome step particularly for the influencer marketing industry” said Syed Muzamil Hasan Zaidi founder of one8nine Media. “This form of data gathering and detailed reporting is already a norm across the world and will help marketers target their ads better towards relevant customers. This will help increase customer satisfaction towards partnered/paid content as currently irrelevant ad pieces annoy the viewers and the influencers end up being the target of their frustration. This will also increase ROI through campaigns whether it is based on conversions or brand affinity thereby increasing the value and payouts for Influencers in their particular niches. All in all I am glad one of the biggest players in the industry is taking a step in the right direction.”

Using Google’s Display & Video 360 advertisers and agencies can use a blend of first-party data and second-party data to create lookalike audiences thereby reaching new audiences. A prominent example of this is fitness nutrition brands buying data from websites catering to health and fashion.

The true benefit of a second-party data marketplace may be in its implicit impact on predicting the behavior of target audiences including future patterns which can be monetized down the line. The second-party data also comes with insights on the content consumption habits of the audience and an understanding of what they prefer interacting with.

As digital publishers look to expand paths towards data monetization selling to a data exchange appears to be a low-risk path to growing business viability and exploring an alternative avenue for growth. The second-party data handed over is often demographic and contextual while also being mobile-first and pinpointed to a location. Existing regional leaders in this space include Oracle Lotame Neustar Salesforce and Adobe.

The BlueKai data management platform (DMP) by Oracle is a strategic partner of Brainchild at the moment as stated in the widely circulated Mondelez case study. According to a whitepaper from the American multinational computer technology corporation the data sellers can use the 2nd party listings page to list the private data assets they have available for monetization cooperative campaigns or analytics-only use cases.

“Data buyers can browse the listings and contact the data sellers when they are interested in buying data” says the paper. “Second-party listings help to generate interest and facilitate deals for clients and publishers and enable marketers to independently discover buying opportunities in the second-party data marketplace.”

For media agencies such as Brainchild the private data marketplace by Oracle allows them to monetize data assets through custom and direct-to-marketer deals. Protect the value of new and unique data assets in a closed & private market Brainchild will be able to customize pricing for high-value data assets and increase the usage of data assets through audience analytics.

According to Oracle publishers can feature their brand to advertisers in the data cloud ecosystem and monetize data with strategic partners while focusing content and ads based

on data gained or purchased through the marketplace and increase ad buying on sites. For advertisers Oracle promises the freedom to browse and select from the inventory of branded data providers to scale targeting campaigns to a unique set of in-market and highly brand-related consumers.

The Forrester Wave™: Data Management Platforms report for Q2 2019 ranked Salesforce as the best DMP in the world followed by Adobe then Neustar Nielsen and Oracle in that order. It stands to reason by default that the local market leader is Oracle which placed in The Forrester Wave™ in 5th place globally since Nielsen is weening itself off from Pakistan.

“The Oracle DMP acquired as BlueKai is part of the Data Cloud and is positioned to help Oracle straddle both the adtech and martech worlds with its large consortium of third-party data” says the report. “Oracle continues to focus on audience extension use cases and building upon the breadth and depth of its branded data providers adding curated segments to meet vertical-specific audience needs. Its bullish approach to third-party data has led it to put data quality and ethical data sourcing checks in place to vet providers that participate in the Oracle Data Marketplace.”

The report stated that as regulations threaten the data ecosystem concerns arose of how Oracle is future-proofing its solution with the need for the company to communicate a more balanced approach of not only updating its user interface but also investing in its underlying data infrastructure to address client concerns over its product road map.

By contrast the Salesforce DMP gained the best ranking due to its renewed focus on data privacy quality and accuracy. With integrations allowing marketers to begin sequencing toward omnichannel advertising executions Salesforce has proven best suited for marketers looking to manage myriad data sources and a guided approach to data management and syndication.

With the benefits of this initiative seemingly outweighing any local data privacy concerns the workaround of using a second-party data marketplace – in response to 3rd party data depreciation – appears to be a path for media agencies advertisers and publishers to optimize brand messaging based on insights and analysis gained from shared audiences built with second-party data.",,,,,,,,,

Revealed at Computex 2021 the chipmaker says the new Intel 5G Solution 5000 modem will be available in laptops from Acer ASUS and HP later this year and in more than 30 laptop designs by 2022. Intel is also expanding its Tiger Lake lineup for ultra-thin laptops with a CPU that goes up to 5GHz.

Intel is bringing 5G connectivity to laptops and a new Tiger Lake CPU capable of delivering speeds of up to 5GHz to ultra-thin notebooks later this year which it called an industry-first.

The Santa Clara Calif.-based company made the announcements at Computex 2021 on Sunday saying that its new 5G modem called Intel 5G Solution 5000 will be available in laptops from Acer ASUS and HP later this year and in more than 30 laptop designs by 2022. It was developed with MediaTek and Fibocom as part of a previously announced collaboration.

The Intel 5G Solution 5000 is an M.2 module that has been certified for coverage across the world including from carriers AT&T and Spring. Intel said it can deliver download speeds of up to 4.7 Gbps and upload speeds of up to 1.25 Gbps. This translates into a nearly five-fold increase in speed over Intel’s Gigabit LTE technology the company added.

The chipmaker also revealed two additions to the company’s 11th-generation Core U-Series mobile processors which are collectively known under the code name Tiger Lake. The first is a new flagship CPU the Intel Core i7-1195G7 which the company said can deliver up to 5GHz on a single core in turbo mode and outpaces AMD’s top Ryzen 7 5800U across multiple games and content creation applications.

For instance Intel said the new Core i7-1195G7 can provide 46-178 percent faster performance across games ranging from Fortnite to Valheim compared to AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800U. In addition the company said the new Core i7 is 93 percent faster for video editing 82 percent faster for DaVinci Resolve 156 percent faster for Cyberlink Power Director 136 percent faster for Adobe Lightroom Photo Merge and 98 percent faster for Adobe Premiere Pro Scene Detect. For the HandBrake open-source video transcoder Intel said the Core i8 can deliver as much as eight times faster performance.

The new processors which also includes the new mid-range Intel Core i5-1155G7 will be available in laptops from Acer ASUS Lenovo and MSI this summer and will go in more than 60 laptop designs by the holiday season. Intel said this will bring the total number of laptop designs with Tiger Lake CPUs to nearly 250 by the end of the year.

The Core i7-1195G7 comes with four cores eight threads a 2.9GHz base frequency a 5GHz single-core turbo frequency a 4.6GHz all-core turbo frequency a 12 MB cache 96 graphics execution units and a 1.4GHz graphics frequency. The Core i5-1155G7 comes with four cores eight threads a 2.5GHz base frequency a 4.5GHz single-core turbo frequency a 4.3GHz all-core turbo frequency an 8 MB cache 80 graphics execution units and a 1.35GHz graphics frequency

“We’ve taken the world’s best processor for thin-and-light Windows laptops and made the experience even better with the addition of our two new 11th Gen Intel Core processors with Intel Iris Xe graphics” said Chris Walker corporate vice president and general manager of mobility client platforms at Intel in a statement.",,,,,,,,,,,,

NBCUniversal and Lionsgate

Buying Lionsgate would help Comcast's NBCUniversal on two different fronts. First it would add more content to Peacock NBCUniversal's subscription video service. Lionsgate owns shows including ""Mad Men"" ""Orange is the New Black"" ""Nashville"" and ""Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist."" Lionsgate currently licenses those shows to a grab bag of streaming services. Second Lionsgate owns premium network Starz which would fit seamlessly with NBCUniversal's offerings. NBCUniversal doesn't have a premium network unlike competitors WarnerMedia (HBO) and ViacomCBS (Showtime). On the streaming front a Starz-Peacock combination -- either together as one service or separately as a bundled offering -- could expand NBCUniversal's global aspirations. Starz is on track to have 60 million global subscribers by 2025 Chief Executive John Feltheimer said this week. Starz is already available in 58 different countries which would give Peacock a head start in its expansion aspirations. And Lionsgate wouldn't cost much with a market capitalization of just $3.8 billion (an an enterprise value of about $6.4 billion). If Comcast is going to keep NBCUniversal -- bucking AT&T's decision to give up on vertical integration -- buying Lionsgate would be a sensible move to stay competitive in the streaming wars without breaking the bank.

WarnerMedia-Discovery and ViacomCBS

There's already speculation about a potential future merger between the newly created WarnerMedia-Discovery entity (assuming the deal closes) and NBCUniversal. Discovery's controlling shareholder John Malone said on CNBC how the combined company could be open to a future merger with NBCUniversal if regulatory forces would allow it. But the divestments that might have to take place could be too complicated and tax-inefficient for that combination to occur. Regulators might not allow CNN and MSNBC to be housed under one corporate roof. Combining Comcast's Universal and WarnerMedia's Warner Bros. -- the No. 2 and No. 3 largest film studios by box office revenue in 2019 and 2018 the last full years of theatrical releases -- may also be a non-starter. The more logical combination would be WarnerMedia-Discovery and ViacomCBS . Shari Redstone's company has a broadcast network -- CBS. WarnerMedia-Discovery doesn't so that's a fit. (The combination of CBS and NBC under one roof would be one major roadblock to a ViacomCBS-NBCUniversal merger.) Unlike NBCUniversal ViacomCBS doesn't have a large cable news network. That makes keeping CNN more viable. While ViacomCBS also owns a movie studio Paramount has been a much smaller box office presence than Universal in recent years. Among global film studios Paramount was sixth in box office revenue in both 2018 and 2019. Putting together Paramount and Warner Bros. would be an easier sell for antitrust concerns. The biggest complication would be if Redstone is willing to give up or dilute her controlling ViacomCBS shares. That's what Malone did to push Discovery and WarnerMedia together so there's now a template.

Disney and AMC Networks

This is the hardest sell. Disney doesn't really need AMC Networks . It's doing perfectly fine with the content it has. But with Disney-owned Hulu licensing so much of its content it's vulnerable to losing some of its hit shows. MGM for example makes ""The Handmaid's Tale."" Now that Amazon has acquired MGM it's unclear if the series will remain on Hulu once that deal closes. The owner of ""The Walking Dead"" IFC Films and Sundance Now could provide an adult-themed content boost to Hulu. That would balance out the robust kids' offering on Disney+ and sports on ESPN+. AMC has forecast it will have at least 9 million streaming subscribers by the end of 2021 and 25 million by the end of 2025. That's a far cry from Hulu's current 41.6 million or Disney+'s 103.6 million but it's evidence that there's at least some audience for the programming. And while cable is slowly dying it's not dead yet with about 85 million U.S. households still subscribing to some form of bundled linear TV. Disney's ESPN remains the lifeblood of the traditional pay-TV bundle. Bundling AMC Networks' cable networks with ESPN would protect affiliate fees as pay-TV providers have always been loathe to drop ESPN. The Dolan Family controls AMC Networks. The Dolans have likely known for years that AMC Networks is subscale and should combine with a bigger media fish. If the Dolans don't want to sell they won't. But AMC Networks is relatively tiny at $2.2 billion in market valuation and about $4 billion in enterprise value. Disney could easily buy the company in cash. However Disney's previous acquisitions -- Pixar Marvel Lucas Films -- have been for intellectual property. Does AMC Networks own enough valuable IP to make a deal worth it for shareholders? And is that IP family-friendly enough to mesh with the company's theme park business? That may be why a Disney-AMC deal hasn't already happened.

This term sounds a bit cliché and almost ambiguous but it doesn’t get any clearer than Brian Swan’s transition from an overworked robotics engineer to a self-employed business development strategist – traveling at will with his family surfing actual waves in Indonesian waters running a successful beard care company and being Unstoppable with his goals and visions.

Brian an American serial entrepreneur is the co-founder of Unstoppable Branding Agency a multiple award-winning PR and media company providing solutions to all brand positioning problems. Brian founded UBA with his wife Rhonda Renee Swan a renowned entrepreneur author and international speaker popularly known as the Unstoppable Momma.



With their daughter 13-year-old Hanalei the Swans embody an enviable online reputation as the resourceful family of ‘freedom-preneurs’ living with no limits no boundaries and zero restrictions. Brian is also the co-founder of Unstoppable Beard a sustainable brand producing all-natural products for quality beard care.

Brian’s journey to the sought-after life of working and living on his own terms didn’t start in the golden deserts of Morocco the constant carnivals of Brazil or the mind-blowing parks of Costa Rica – highlights of some of the amazing countries The Unstoppable Family has toured in the past 13 years.

Their dreams began in San Diego California peaking with the painful phase of losing everything and still choosing to venture into the uncertainty-rife world of entrepreneurship.

“Navigating through life you can choose anger or you can choose happiness” says Brian who currently resides with his family on the beautiful island of Bali Indonesia. “You can only choose one and that sole decision will form the path you take. Never forget that happiness is a choice.”

Harsh beginnings

Before striking out to build his legacy Brian 47 had worked as a robotics engineer at Parker Hannifin an American multinational corporation specializing in robotic engineering. The job was the typical 9-to-5 role that threw his life into an exhausting routine and left him feeling constantly… chained. As a child Brian had been determined to build a wonderful and happy life for himself but somehow the corporate world wasn’t what he’d imagined.

He recalls how a series of unfair childhood struggles instilled in him the willpower to thrive and survive no matter the cost.

“When I was growing up in Cambridge Illinois my parents got discovered at the age of six and everything fell apart” Brian recounts. “I discovered my dad was gay at the age of nine and while I was too young to be affected by this reality my older siblings fell victim to relentless bullying. Eventually my brother and sister both resorted to substance abuse and I had to watch my brother go to rehab at the age of 15.”

When Brian was 11 his father was diagnosed with AIDS. Knowing the prognosis as his health deteriorated rapidly Brian’s father was determined to make the best of time left with his children and so he took them traveling. The family saw the world together and just before the man died Brian captured an inexplicable moment when he promised his father that he would never settle for less.

“On his deathbed I stood beside him and talked to him even though he couldn’t talk back” Brian recalls. “I said ‘Dad everything’s gonna be alright. I’ll go to university and get a good job’. And even though he couldn’t talk the look in his eyes told me everything. He looked at me as if to say ‘Don’t do that. You’re an entrepreneur.’”

In his first year of high school reeling from the pain of watching his siblings go down difficult roads Brian made a solemn promise to himself that he would walk a different path – a positive one.

“I told myself ‘I’m going to be the best athlete and the smartest kid in my class.’ And this is exactly what I did.”

He went on to become an excellent athlete and graduated at the top of his class. Life had dealt him unfair blows from the start but he wasn’t going to take any of it with folded arms.

Tough decisions and rewarding results

Following a four-year academic journey at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Brian obtained his Bachelor’s in Robotics Engineering and landed a job with Parker Hannifin the next year. He worked with this company for nine years until his wife Rhonda struck out on her own and nudged him toward entrepreneurial freedom.

Rhonda and Brian had met surfing in San Diego back in 1998. They got married in 2003 when Rhonda worked a 9-to-5 corporate position as a marketing executive for GlaxoSmithKline.

“We lived the American dream with a nice house and solid real estate investments” Brian says. “Things were comfortable and I worked in that field for a decade until Rhonda said something that would drastically change our course. She said ‘I want to have a family but I’m not going to put my kids in daycare.’”

In 2004 after an embarrassing talk-down from a senior colleague at work for coming in late Rhonda a young mom with a few-weeks-old baby decided it was time to walk away from the company. She was going to build her own legacy and score her mark in the world.

“I was skeptical at first” says Brian “but Rhonda started to kill it in what was then the new online space of affiliate marketing and personal development. Within one year she retired me from my corporate robotics engineering job back in 2006.”

It was supposed to be an uphill journey from this stage but life doesn’t always have pleasant experiences in-store. The Swans had invested heavily in a golf-course development deal that was supposed to return massive profits. Sadly the fraudulent deal went horribly wrong and they lost everything. With a two-week-old baby and an account balance of $12000 the couple was advised by friends to search for fresh 9-to-5 jobs and secure their lives once again. The entrepreneurial visions couldn’t be relied upon anymore.

However the pair were determined to hold onto the life-changing freedom they’d enjoyed for a short while. In 2008 they packed up their lives and left the United States to become the first “digital nomad” family working out of their laptops as they traveled the world. They created the “freedom-preneur” movement” to help other people cast their fears aside and leap into the online business-building life.

In 2012 the couple co-founded The Unstoppable Branding Agency now a parent brand of multiple seven-figure international businesses run by Rhonda the Unstoppable Momma who brings 18 years of experience in marketing and branding to the table. Brian himself has spent the past decade creating several online businesses across e-commerce marketing and consulting.

50+ countries later across six of the world’s continents the Swans have found a home in Uluwatu Bali Indonesia – living life with no limits and raising their daughter Hanalei a young designer author artist and the founder and CEO of Hanalei Swan- HS Styles an eco-friendly fashion brand based in Bali.

For Brian family is everything and more.

“At first light I surf or exercise on the beach” he said. “Exercising in nature starts my day in the most positive way. On the way back home I pick flowers for my wife and write her a short love message in her gratitude journal every day. That ritual of making yourself and your partner happy creates an unstoppable day.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

From the moment you sign in to your Gmail account to accessing your financial details via PayPal 2FA is there to greet you as a more secure way of logging in. You’ll even find it when setting up a PS5 or Xbox Series X . Heck chances are you’ve already used to today.



Also known as multi-factor authentication 2FA is an extra layer of security — used by virtually every online platform — that stops many low-level hackers in their tracks protecting all your valuable private information from being breached.

Alas hacking tactics are forever evolving and all it takes is one crafty cybercriminal to find a tiny hole in the armor and plunder what were once impenetrable accounts to their heart’s content. But you don’t have to be a whizz at decrypting code to gain access to an unsuspecting victim’s account.



In fact according to the 2021 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report  61% of the 5250 confirmed security breaches the American network operator analyzed involved stolen credentials. Of course multi-factor authentication’s purpose is to prevent malicious actors from gaining access to an account even if they discover a super-secret password.

But much like how Scar left Mufasa to fall to his doom in one of the greatest betrayals of all time the security method can also be the root cause of cybercriminal activity. The real traitor? Your old phone number.



For a better sense of how attackers can easily use two-factor authentication against you it’s best to know what the online security method is and how it works. If it helps think of your old phone number as Scar throughout this piece.

What is two-factor authentication?

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a digital authentication method used to confirm the identity of a user to allow them access to a website or app through at least two pieces of evidence. Two-factor authentication more popularly known as 2FA is the most commonly used method.



In order for 2FA to work a user must have at least two important pieces of credentials in order to log in to an account (with multi-factor usually involving more than three different details). This means if an unauthorized user gets their hands on a password they will still need access to an email or phone number linked to the account where a special code is sent for an extra level of protection.



For example a bank will require a username and password in order for a user to access their account but it also needs a second form of authentication such as a unique code or fingerprint recognition to confirm a user’s identity. This second factor can also be used before a transaction is made.



As explained by software company Ping Identity 2FA’s required credentials are split into three different categories: “what you know” “what you have” and “what you are.” In terms of “what you know” or your knowledge this comes down to your passwords PIN number or answer to a security question such as “what is your mother’s maiden name?” (something I never seem to remember).

(Image credit: Ping Identity)

“What you are” is arguably the most secure category as it confirms your identity from a physical trait unique only to you. This is usually seen on smartphones  such as an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy phone using biometric authentication such as a fingerprint or facial scan to gain access.



As for “what you have” this refers to what is in your possession which can be anything from a smart device to a smartcard. Generally this method means getting a pop-up notification on your phone via SMS that needs to be confirmed before gaining access to an account. For any professionals using Google Gmail for business you’ll have come across this category.



Unfortunately that last category is cause for concern especially when you throw phone number recycling into the mix.

Phone number recycling

According to the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) more than 35 million numbers in the U.S. are disconnected and become available again by reassigning them to a new subscriber every year. Sure numbers are infinite and all but there are only so many 10 or 11-digit combinations a mobile network can offer its customers.



(Image credit: T-Mobile)

The U.K.’s Office of Communications (Ofcom) the entity that assigns mobile numbers to U.K. network providers states (via The Evening Standard ) that it has a strict “use it or lose it” policy for pay-as-you-go mobile numbers. Vodafone disconnects and recycles a phone number after just 90 days of no activity while O2 does this after 12 months.



In the U.S. network providers including Verizon and T-Mobile let customers change and choose the available numbers shown on online number change interfaces via their website or app. There are millions of recycled phone numbers available with more piling up each day.



Recycled numbers can be harmful to those who originally owned them as many platforms including Gmail and Facebook are linked to your mobile number for password recovery or and here’s the kicker two-factor authentication.

How 2FA puts you at risk

A study at Princeton University discovered how easily anyone can obtain a recycled phone number and use it for several common cyberattacks including account takeovers and even denying access to an account by holding it hostage and asking for a ransom in exchange for access.

(Image credit: Princeton University)

According to the study an attacker can find available numbers and check if any of them are associated with online accounts from previous owners. By viewing their online profiles and checking to see if their old number is linked attackers can buy the recycled number (just $15 at T-Mobile) and reset the password on the accounts. Using 2FA they will then receive and enter the special code sent via SMS.



The researchers tested 259 numbers they obtained through the two U.S. mobile carriers and found that 171 of them had a linked account on at least one of six commonly used websites: Amazon AOL Facebook Google PayPal and Yahoo. This is called a “reverse lookup attack.”

Researchers found another variation of the attack that allowed malicious actors to hijack accounts without having to reset a password. Using online people search service BeenVerified  a hacker could search for an email address by using a recycled phone number then check if the email addresses had been involved in data breaches using Have I Been Pwned? . If they had the attacker could buy the password on a cybercriminal black market and break into a 2FA-enabled account without needing to reset a password.

To make matters worse attackers can also take your account hostage. A nasty trick sees a hacker obtain a number to sign up to several online services that require a phone number. Once complete they discontinue the service so the number can be recycled for a new subscriber to start using. When the new user tries to sign up for the same services the hacker will be notified via 2FA and deny them a way to use the service. The threat actor will then ask for the victim to pay a ransom if they want to use these online services.



Using 2FA in this way is atrocious but that doesn’t stop it from happening. T-Mobile reviewed the research back in December and now reminds subscribers to update their contact number on bank accounts and social media profiles on its number change support page . But that’s all the carrier has the power to do meaning those not informed will be open to attacks.

Alternate ways to use 2FA

If anything phone numbers and 2FA don’t gel very well. The good news however is that there are now more options available when opting to use 2FA including the aforementioned biometric methods or authenticator apps.

Google Pixel 5's fingerprint scanner (Image credit: Laptop Mag)

However these options aren’t always available and sometimes online services only provide you two options for 2FA: your phone number or your email address. If you don’t want hackers rummaging through your private information it’s best to opt for email authentication. Of course there are those who don’t always use their emails and with time can often forget their passwords. No password means no way of obtaining an authentication code.



To solve this it’s best to find a password manager. LastPass used to be the go-to for years thanks to its free-tier service but there are other contenders worth checking out.



“But what if I’m already using my phone number for 2FA?” I hear you ask. If you’re considering changing your phone number make sure to unlink your phone number from the online services it is connected to before making the switch. And if you have already made the switch it is well worth your time updating your accounts to get rid of any Scars (phone numbers) lying in wait to backstab you when you least expect it.

Now the PayPal-owned mobile payment service has started rolling out a change in users' privacy settings that would allow you to hide your friends list.

Jane Manchun Wong a software engineer and app researcher known for unearthing yet-to-be-released features in applications discovered the new setting on Friday. The new Friends List section lets you set your lists to be visible to friends only or to be visible only to yourself. However it's still set to public by default which means any Venmo user can see your list unless you go into your settings and change it. You can now choose not to appear in other people's friends lists though by making sure the appropriate option is toggled off in the same settings section.

Venmo has confirmed the new feature to BuzzFeed News telling the publication that it's enhancing its ""in-app controls providing customers an option to select a public friends-only or private setting for their friends list.” The publication says some users have already set their lists to private but the feature may take some time to make its way to everyone.

Critics and groups like the EFF have been calling out Venmo for years now for not giving users the ability to hide their friends lists. It's a privacy and security issue seeing as it makes it easy for anyone to look up who's paying who. EFF Associate Director of Research Gennie Gebhart said back in 2019: ""Your bank doesn't put details of your financial transactions into a public timeline and Venmo shouldn’t either without your affirmative consent.""

While the option to hide friends lists now exists critics believe Venmo's action is still lacking. As Kaili Lambe a senior campaigner with Mozilla told BuzzFeed News: ""... consumers shouldn’t have to dig around in product settings to find basic privacy protections. Consumers expect privacy to be the default and so do we.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9wdWItYXBwLWRhdGEtd2hldGhlcnNwb29uLWdyZWVuZS1raW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,All those pub apps you've downloaded are a privacy nightmare,"It’s been a long 15 months and now people are heading back out into the world.

And small talk with the bar staff has been replaced with ordering through an app. Each pub or chain seems to have its own app that you need to download to book a table or make an order – and each of these collects information about you.

“When hospitality started to have an obligation to take contact details last year there was no obvious privacy-preserving tool to do this with” says Michael Veale a lecturer in digital rights and regulations at University College London. “In many hospitality venues they are still using the technology from the earlier part of the pandemic last year to fulfil orders and table service which collect unnecessary information.”

So which apps collect what – and should you be worried?

Wetherspoon app

Wetherspoon’s order and pay app has existed since 2017 long before the pandemic but has become more widely used to aid social distancing in pubs. It collects information including any forms you fill in through the app such as your name address email address and phone number.

In order to make sure you’re ordering food and drinks from the right pub it also uses GPS to track your location and unusually can request access to location data when the app isn’t open. This practice “seems unnecessary” says Konrad Kollnig of Oxford University and the creator of the TrackerControl Slim app which analyses how Android apps track and share data.

It gives information such as your email and PayPal username to third-party payment providers and information about your device such as the type of operating system. “Personal data provided when registering to use the App shall be retained until such time that the User requests that the Data Controller amend or remove the data” the app’s privacy policy says.

The Android version of the app appears to have wider-ranging access permissions than the iOS version. On Android it has the ability to read modify and delete the contents of your USB storage and take pictures and video from your camera.

Greene King app

The Greene King app can be used to find and book tables at the more than 1600 Greene King pubs across the UK as well as ordering and paying for food. The app’s privacy policy links on both the Apple and Google app stores is broken but a company spokesperson said it would be fixed shortly. Its wider privacy policy which covers everything from booking rooms and tables to playing pub poker doesn’t appear to cover the app in detail except for a small section of a table.

There the privacy policy says it collects users’ names contact details booking information loyalty card info transaction details date of birth email address telephone number and payment details.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbWluaW9ucG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yOS9kYXZpZC1vbGRoYW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Oldham,"David W.

The machine makes it convenient and rewarding for people to recycle on the go. plastic bottles of any brand can used in the machine. The RVM itself is like a vending machine in reverse. Consumers press the start button on a touch screen and the RVM opens up a slot to receive the plastic bottle. Once deposited the RVM compresses the PET so that it is ready for the next steps of recycling.

The RVM is part of the company’s larger strategy and intent to take meaningful steps towards tackling the issue of plastic waste. Earlier this year PepsiCo announced the country’s largest plastics collection and recycling project under the Prime Minister’s Clean Green Pakistan program. Making steady progress towards this goal the company announced more than doubling its existing targets for plastic collection and recycling. PepsiCo Pakistan will scale up its existing 4750 tons plastics collection program by adding another 5500 tons making a total of 10250 tons of plastics to be collected and recycled in 2021. The program is implemented by PepsiCo’s partner Green Earth Recycling and its progress is being monitored by WWF-Pakistan. Both these important announcements come in the buildup to the world environment day which is being proudly hosted by Pakistan this year.

Prime Minister’s special assistant on Climate Change Mr. Malik Amin Aslam commented ‘’ All of us will have to work together to truly address the plastic issue. The RVM machine is a way of making that connection with the public and encouraging them to recycle. I’d like congratulate PepsiCo on its continued efforts on the plastic agenda I am particularly happy to see the progress on its plastics collection and recycling program’

Mr. Furqan Ahmed Syed PepsiCo CEO Pakistan and Afghanistan commented that ‘ The RVM is part of our multi-pronged strategy to invest to increase recycling rates in key markets through campaigns that encourage consumers to recycle and partnerships to increase and improve recycling infrastructure on the whole. We have already launched a collection program for 4750 tons of plastic earlier this year. We are today more than doubling this target and increasing the total collection to 10250 tons. This will continue to be the largest plastic waste collection program in the country.’’

Packaging waste is an urgent global problem. While plastic is a lightweight and highly effective packaging material that helps to keep food safe accessible and affordable PepsiCo estimates that only 14% of what is used is effectively recycled. This will require fundamental changes in how packaging is made and disposed of along with rethinking its forms and functions.

PepsiCo envisions a world where plastics need never become waste. The company shares concern over the growing threat that packaging waste poses to communities and the environment. As a global leader in food and beverages it believes it has an important role to play in making sustainable packaging a reality.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtdGhyb3diYWNrLXNuYWNrLWJyYW5kLW5ldy1yZWxlYXNlcy1zdW1tZXItMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,9 Nostalgic Snack Brands Launching New Treats for Summer,"If reality's had you longing for the old days like when the most complicated thing in your life was reaching the next level of Zelda and your biggest problem was when McDonald's forgot to put the toy in your Happy Meal… well get ready.

PFE,Pfizer,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3RoZWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20vY2FuLWktZ2V0LWFzdHJhemVuZWNhLW5vdy1hbmQtcGZpemVyLWxhdGVyLXdoeS1taXhpbmctYW5kLW1hdGNoaW5nLWNvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmVzLWNvdWxkLWhlbHAtc29sdmUtbWFueS1yb2xsb3V0LXByb2JsZW1zLTE2MTQwNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can I get AstraZeneca now and Pfizer later? Why mixing and matching COVID vaccines could help solve many rollout ...,"In the face of changing eligibility for the AstraZeneca vaccine new variants of the coronavirus and supply constraints many people are wondering whether they can “mix and match” COVID-19 vaccines.

This means for example having the AstraZeneca vaccine as the first dose followed by a different vaccine such as Pfizer as the second dose and boosters with other vaccines later on.

While many studies are ongoing data has recently been released from mix and match trials in Spain and the United Kingdom.

This data is very promising and suggests mix and match schedules may give higher antibody levels than two doses of a single vaccine.

While Australia’s drug regulator the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) hasn’t yet approved a mix and match COVID-19 vaccination schedule some countries are already doing this.

So how does this work and why might it be a good idea?

What’s the benefit of mixing and matching?

If the COVID-19 vaccine rollout can mix and match vaccines this will greatly increase flexibility.

Having a flexible immunisation program allows us to be nimble in the face of global supply constraints. If there’s a shortage of one vaccine instead of halting the entire program to wait for supply the program can continue with a different vaccine regardless of which one has been given as a first dose.

If one vaccine is less effective than another against a certain variant mix and match schedules could ensure people who’ve already received one dose of a vaccine with lower effectiveness could get a booster with a vaccine that’s more effective against the variant.

Some countries are already using mix and match vaccine schedules following changing recommendations regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine because of a very rare side effect of a blood clotting/bleeding condition.

Read more: What is thrombocytopenia the rare blood condition possibly linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine?

Several countries in Europe are now advising younger people previously given this vaccine as a first dose should receive an alternative vaccine as their second dose most commonly mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer’s.

Germany France Sweden Norway and Denmark are among those advising mixed vaccination schedules due to this reason.

Is it safe?

In a UK mix and match study published in the Lancet in May 830 adults over 50 were randomised to get either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines first then the other vaccine later.

It found people who received mixed doses were more likely to develop mild to moderate symptoms from the second dose of the vaccine including chills fatigue fever headache joint pain malaise muscle ache and pain at the injection site compared to those on the standard non-mixed schedule.

However these reactions were short-lived and there were no other safety concerns. The researchers have now adapted this study to see whether early and regular use of paracetamol reduces the frequency of these reactions.

Another similar study (not-peer reviewed) in Spain found most side effects were mild or moderate and short-lived (two to three days) and were similar to the side effects from getting two doses of the same vaccine.

Is it effective?

The Spanish study found people had a vastly higher antibody response 14 days after receiving the Pfizer booster following an initial dose of AstraZeneca.

These antibodies were able to recognise and inactivate the coronavirus in lab tests.

This response to the Pfizer boost seems to be stronger than the response after receiving two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine according to earlier trial data. The immune response of getting Pfizer followed by AstraZeneca isn’t known yet but the UK will have results available soon.

There’s no data yet on how effective mix and match schedules are in preventing COVID-19. But they’re likely to work well as the immune response is similar or even better compared with studies using the same vaccine as the first and second dose. This indicates they will work well in preventing disease.

Might this be one way to help resolve Australia’s slow rollout?

In Australia we’ve seen many people wanting to “wait for Pfizer” and not have the AstraZeneca vaccine. This is despite the UK’s recent real-world findings that following two doses both vaccines are similarly effective against the variants circulating in the UK.

Delays in vaccine uptake have also been due to concerns regarding the very rare but serious blood clotting/bleeding syndrome after the first dose of AstraZeneca as well as changing age restrictions in terms of who can receive this vaccine.

This caused widespread uncertainty and meant some younger people in some countries in Europe who had already received a first dose were excluded from getting a second dose.

The results from these mix and match studies support the possibility of vaccinating people who have received the first dose from AstraZeneca with a different booster if the need arises.

Further studies are underway to evaluate mix and match schedules with Moderna and Novavax vaccines both of which Australia has supply deals with.

Don’t delay getting vaccinated

As Victoria tackles its current outbreak many other countries in our region are experiencing a surge in cases too. These include Fiji Taiwan and Singapore countries previously hailed as excellent examples of how to manage COVID-19.

These examples highlight the difficulty of sustained suppression in the absence of high vaccination coverage. This will be further exacerbated by the new more transmissible variants.

The current cases in Victoria are caused by the B.1.617.1 (“Indian”) variant. Both vaccines are effective against the closely related B.1.617.2 variant (albeit a bit lower than against B.1.1.7) and we would expect similar effectiveness against B.1.617.1.

It’s not clear what kind of evidence regulatory authorities like Australia’s TGA would require for a mixed schedule to be approved for use.

While we are waiting it’s critical eligible people don’t delay getting vaccinated with the vaccine that’s offered to them now. Vaccination is an essential part of the pandemic exit strategy.

It’s likely the vaccination schedule will be modified in the future as boosters may be needed. This is normal for vaccination programs — we already do this each year with the influenza vaccine.

Yeadon a retired British scientist has been a vocal critic of health authorities for introducing lockdown measures requirements to wear face masks and rolling out vaccines against Covid-19.

His credibility has been enhanced among lockdown sceptics because of his former role at Pfizer the pharmaceutical company which has developed one of the main vaccines against the virus.

Yeadon spent more than a decade and a half at the company as an allergy and respiratory researcher though he left the firm in 2011.

Some posts on social media occasionally misstate Yeadon’s role at Pfizer appearing to give him more prominence at the company than he actually had.

A claim by him that was debunked by The Journal in December referred to him as a former vice president of the company. However he was a former vice president in Pfizer’s allergy and respiratory research division only.

Yeadon’s claims about Covid-19 regularly feature on anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine pages but many are incredibly misleading or do not stand up to evidence at all.

Here is the truth behind some of his more common claims.

Claim 1: Covid-19 is not a new illness and is caused by a virus that’s like other ‘harmless’ viruses

Yeadon has regularly sought to downplay the impact of Covid-19 by claiming that the virus which causes it SARS-CoV-2 is not new but the same as previous coronaviruses.

But this is false: Covid-19 is a new illness and SARS-Cov-2 is a unique virus.

The illness is called Covid-19 because it is a coronavirus disease that was first detected in 2019. The first known infections from SARS‑CoV‑2 were in Wuhan in China in December that year with investigations underway as to the original source of the virus.

The following month the WHO even recommended calling the virus 2019-nCov standing for ’2019 novel coronavirus’.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control specifically states that SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans.

It is also wrong to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is the same as other coronaviruses.

There are many different types of coronaviruses which generally circulate in animals. But very few of these have spread to humans and can be transmitted between humans.

Only six ‘species’ of human coronavirus are known one of which – SARS-CoV – has split into two different strains giving seven strains of human coronavirus in total.

Four of these – OC43 HKU1 229E and NL63 – are relatively harmless. They generally cause symptoms of the common cold or other upper respiratory tract infections.

The other three strains have caused serious illness and death in humans.

SARS-CoV-2 is a close genetic relative of the original SARS-CoV virus which caused the SARS epidemic earlier this century but they are not the same.

SARS was far from a “harmless” illness: by the end of the SARS epidemic in June 2003 the virus had infected 8422 people – around 10% of whom died.

And MERS-CoV which caused Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has infected fewer people but is even more deadly than both SARS viruses.

There have only been 2574 confirmed cases of MERS since it first began spreading in 2012 but 866 people have died – a fatality rate of about 34%.

In short each of the seven human coronaviruses are unique and some are far more damaging than others.

But it is incorrect to claim the virus that causes Covid-19 is the same as other coronaviruses and to imply that it is therefore not harmful.

Claim 2: If you’ve had a cold you’re immune from Covid-19

Yeadon has varied his claim about other coronaviruses to suggest that the majority of people had immunity to Covid-19 before SARS-CoV-2 ever started circulating because most of us have had common colds.

But this has not been proven. What’s more symptoms of the common cold are sometimes caused by different types of virus to SARS-CoV-2.

Common colds are not just caused by coronaviruses: different virus families such as rhinoviruses respiratory syncytial viruses and parainfluenza viruses can also cause mild colds in people.

In theory the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could be inhibited among those who have had one of these viruses and other types of coronaviruses.

Studies are ongoing to assess how much immunity cold-causing coronaviruses provide against SARS-CoV-2.



One such study in the Journal of Clinical Investigation linked these coronavirus infections to less severe cases of Covid-19 in people who caught the latter.

Other studies are also looking into other different types of infection. But none of these studies are conclusive or suggest in any way that a person who has had one form of coronavirus can’t get Covid-19. Research is still ongoing.

For the time being it is untrue to state that those who have had a common cold are immune from Covid-19.

Claim 3: There is almost no difference between Covid-19 variants

One of the more common claims attributed to Yeadon is the suggestion that Covid-19 variants of concern are not a bigger threat to people than other strains of the virus.

Multiple iterations of this claim have circulated on social media in recent months both in videos featuring Yeadon and as part of image-based posts where someone has shared a photo containing quotes purporting to be from him.

In a recent video interview posted online Yeadon downplayed the difference between different Covid-19 variants by mockingly referring to them as “same-iants”.

In another video he claimed that all Covid-19 variants are at most 0.3% genetically different from each other.

And an image containing a quote by Yeadon further claims that “all variants are at least 99.7% identical to the Wuhan sequence”.

But these claims are misleading because they imply that there is virtually no difference in variants of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19). We know that this is not true from the impact that different variants of concern have had during the pandemic.

The isolation of the virus in laboratory settings has enabled scientists to identify thousands of mutations of SARS-CoV-2 since the beginning of the pandemic last year.

This is a natural process. As a virus replicates and transmits from person to person its genes experience certain ‘copying errors’ (that is genetic mutations).

One form of virus with a ‘copying error’ can then undergo another ‘copying error’ the next time it replicates which can ultimately lead to changes in how the virus works.

It’s basically an evolutionary process for the virus and the reason why certain forms of virus – like ones which make SARS-CoV-2 transmit more easily – become dominant.

Of course mutations which make the virus more infectious or cause more severe illness are concerning to public health officials.

Variants including B117 (the ‘Kent variant’) 501.V2 (the ‘South Africa variant’) B16172 (the variant first identified in India) and P1 and P2 (both identified in Brazil) have all caused officials to sit up and take note because they have presented huge challenges.

These variants either made the virus more transmissible (as was the case with B117) or they were associated with higher levels of severe illness in younger people (P1 and P2) or they caused certain vaccines to be less effective (501.V2).

Despite being very similar to other strains of SARS-CoV-2 these variants still managed to ravage the countries where they circulated – often causing more pressure on hospitals which in some cases lead to more deaths and worse outcomes.



It is misleading to suggest that all variants are the same.

Claim 4: Covid-19 is not a threat or fatal to anyone below the age of 60

Like many before him Yeadon has also suggested that the risk of Covid-19 is overplayed because it primarily affects older people.

But this claim is false: Covid-19 is a risk to people of all ages and the virus has killed young people.

In general the virus is more likely to cause adverse outcomes in those who are older. Younger people are less likely to require hospital treatment but both hospitalisations and deaths have occurred in younger populations.

Younger people can get very sick with Covid-19 and occasionally die as a result of the virus.

Latest data from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (which is only available up to 12 May because of the HSE cyber attack) shows that in Ireland 54 people under the age of 45 88 people aged between 45 and 54 and 266 people aged 55 to 64 have died from Covid-19.

Furthermore death is not the only outcome from Covid-19.

Many of those who contract the virus including young people continue to suffer from after-effects for months following infection while the WHO has said that some patients “develop medical complications that may have lasting health effects”.

In a US study among those aged 18 to 34 years who were in good health before they contracted the virus 20% reported that some symptoms were prolonged.

The WHO further warned that long-term health problems as a result of Covid-19 could include heart failure lung failure loss of smell cognitive impairment fatigue and anxiety and depression.

The group also says that as a new illness it still not fully known what the long-term effects of the virus are and more time and research is needed to understand them.

It is misleading to suggest that Covid-19 only affects older people and it is untrue to say it is not fatal to those under the age of 60.

Claim 5: Covid-19 is not transmissible when a person is asymptomatic

Another claim made by Yeadon and others is that people who have Covid-19 can’t spread it to others when they don’t have any symptoms of the virus.

A related claim is that a person who is asymptomatic doesn’t need to wear a mask because they can’t give Covid-19 to someone else.

These claims are completely untrue. Scientific evidence shows that a person with Covid-19 can spread the virus to someone else even if they don’t have any symptoms.

Australian Associated Press previously debunked claims like this by Yeadon here.

The agency pointed to multiple studies which show that those infected with SARS-CoV-2 can still pass it on to others despite showing no symptoms.

They include a 2020 review of evidence on asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection published in the American College of Physicians’ Annals of Internal Medicine.

That study suggested that asymptomatic patients could transmit the virus to others for more than 14 days and it also suggested there was a 40-45% chance that a person with Covid-19 would be asymptomatic.

The US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also published a study in January which estimated that asymptomatic patients accounted for more than half of all Covid-19 transmissions based on an analysis of eight studies from China.

And the World Health Organisation (WHO) also states that people with Covid-19 “can transmit the virus both when they have symptoms and when they don’t have symptoms”.

It follows that asymptomatic patients should wear masks to stop themselves from spreading the virus to others. It is untrue to claim that they cannot spread the virus.

Claim 6: Closing borders to stop Covid-19 and variants being imported is a ‘pointless’ measure

Elsewhere Yeadon has suggested that the closure of international borders to stop the spread of Covid-19 is a “pointless” health measure.

He has suggested that variants arrive “spontaneously” and that closing borders is like “having six inches of water on your ground floor and trying to close the door”.

But this only makes sense for countries where Covid-19 and variants of concern are already circulating.

Closing borders or quarantining people arriving from countries with high levels of Covid-19 or where variants are circulating can be an effective public health measure.

Several countries have closed their borders at various stages of the pandemic.

According to an analysis of 29 studies about border closures published on medRxiv and cited in the journal Nature most models show that travel restrictions and border closures reduced the arrival of people with Covid-19 in many countries.

Another modelling study published in The Lancet in December also found that earlier in the pandemic international travellers would have contributed to 10% of cases in 102 countries though their contribution to cases would have dropped later in the pandemic.

That study said that countries can expect people with Covid-19 to arrive if there are no travel restrictions in place.

It also highlighted that stringent travel restrictions can stop high rates of Covid-19 in countries where incidence is low if a local epidemic was at a tipping point and if large numbers of passengers would arrive if restrictions were not in place.

However the study also said that local epidemics can continue to rage even when travel restrictions are in place and that stringent restrictions have little effect in countries where the incidence is high.

Nevertheless closing borders in some circumstances is effective at stopping the spread of Covid-19.

It is also important to point out that The Lancet study was published in early December weeks before the B117 variant began circulating in the UK and Ireland and other variants of concern were identified in South Africa and Brazil.

B117 which in recent months made up more than 90% of cases in Ireland has repeatedly been described by public health officials here as like a new virus.

It began circulating in Ireland after arriving from the UK before Christmas and going by the logic of The Lancet study stringent border controls would have prevented this ‘new’ virus getting a foothold here if they had been in place.

Similar measures including mandatory hotel quarantine have since acted as a buffer to help prevent other ‘new’ versions of the virus – including variants first identified in Brazil India and South Africa – from gaining a foothold here.

On Thursday Health Minister Stephen Donnelly told the Dáil that the hotel quarantine system had detected 59 cases of variants of concern: 47 cases of B117 and 12 cases of P1.

That meant 59 cases of new forms of the virus were caught which could have spread in the community if the hotel quarantine system had not been introduced.

As well as stopping the spread of Covid-19 closing borders and introducing border restrictions can be effective at limiting the spread of variants as well.

Claim 7: Hydroxychloroquine asthma inhalers Vitamin D and ivermectin are effective treatments against Covid-19

Throughout the pandemic many supplements and forms of medicine have been posited as treatments against Covid-19.

Another claim by Yeadon suggests that hydroxychloroquine inhaled steroids Vitamin D and ivermectin are all effective against the virus.

Although some of these treatments can help alleviate symptoms it is misleading to suggest that the virus or adverse outcomes from it can be prevented by using them alone.

These treatments may help those who have already contracted Covid-19 – and it’s important to note that studies are still working out whether this is the case – but they will not prevent a person from catching the virus or from being hospitalised by it.

Full Fact has previously debunked claims that Vitamin D the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin are effective treatments against the virus.

Studies – including one carried out by researchers at Trinity College Dublin – have pointed to links between lower levels of vitamin D and the severity of infection in those who contract Covid-19.

A study of Covid-19 patients at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown also showed that those admitted to intensive care and put on ventilators had lower levels of vitamin D.

A recent report published by the Oireachtas found that people in Ireland should take Vitamin D to boost their immune systems.

However it said that this works primarily as a way to fend against the severe impact of Covid-19 before infection rather than as a treatment after a person becomes infected.

Similarly there is no evidence that hydroxychloroquine has treated or prevented Covid-19. In March the World Health Organisation recommended against using it as a treatment citing no meaningful effect on death or admission to hospital from the virus.

There has been some debate about the use of Ivermectin to treat Covid-19 with studies showing that it can effectively reduce the replication of SARS-CoV-2 but only at doses higher than would be used in humans.

Although it has been used in some countries current evidence about the use of Ivermectin as a Covid-19 treatment is inconsistent.

There are also questions as to how effective asthmas inhalers are against the virus.

A recent study did find that a small number of Covid-19 patients who took Budesonide – who had not yet been admitted to hospital - had a shorter recovery time.

But the study was limited and did not find that any asthma inhaler will prevent a person from contracting the virus in the first place.

The HSE recommends that asthmatics take their preventer inhaler to decrease the risk of having an asthma attack but there is no official guidance about their use here.

Claim 8: PCR testing is not reliable

Like others Yeadon has suggested that the use of PCR tests to detect Covid-19 is not reliable. He has also claimed that the tests produce a high number of false positives.

However PCR tests are quite reliable at detecting Covid-19 but are far more likely to result in false negatives – where a person has the virus but their test result says they do not.

We’ve previously looked at both these claims here.

Claim 9: Covid-19 vaccines are not safe or effective

Yeadon has also attempted to undermine the rollout of vaccines against Covid-19 claiming that they are unsafe and ineffective against fighting the virus.

Neither of these things are true.

Covid-19 vaccines have proven incredibly safe while preliminary data from multiple countries shows it is highly effective in reducing adverse outcomes from the virus.

We previously looked at evidence supporting the use of Covid-19 vaccines here.

Claim 10: The Covid-19 vaccine is killing people and leading to a large number of serious adverse events

Yeadon has also made various claims suggesting that Covid-19 vaccines are causing high rates of death.

In one claim he states that more people have died after being given Covid-19 vaccines than the number of people who have died after being given every other type of vaccine combined over a period of 30 years.

He has also claimed that a large proportion of people who’ve been vaccinated so far have experienced serious adverse reactions.

Both of these claims purposely inflate the level of risk posed by vaccines and are misleading about how safe vaccines actually are.

It’s important to state: all vaccines approved for use in human populations including Covid-19 vaccines have been rigorously tested are consistently monitored and are among the safest medical products in the world.

We have previously looked at the safety record of vaccines here.

In summary they are incredibly safe: more than a billion people around the world have been given a dose of a Covid-19 vaccine – including 2.5 million people in Ireland.

It’s not possible to put an exact figure on it but the overwhelming majority of these people are still alive. And most those who died did not succumb to effects from the vaccine.

Here the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has previously explained that there will inevitably be deaths among people who have received the Covid-19 vaccine.

This is especially because many people who received the vaccine at the beginning of the rollout were older or vulnerable patients.

That does not mean these people died as a result of getting the Covid-19 vaccine.

What’s more saying that a “large proportion” of people have experienced adverse events is not proof of anything if it is not put in proportion to anything else.

A ‘large’ number of people could be whatever a person wants it to be: 30 people in a room could be considered a ‘large’ number as could a crowd of 50 people outdoors somewhere.

But 30 or 50 people out of billions worldwide is an infinitesimal proportion.

In Ireland around 2.5 million people have had at least one dose of the vaccine. But figures released earlier this month by the HPRA state that just 7862 people have self-reported any kind of suspected side-effect – including minor ones.

It is important to clarify that these reports are also based on the suspicion that a person has experienced an adverse effect and that it does not mean that the symptoms were caused by a vaccine.

In contrast because the reporting system is voluntary not all suspected side-effects will be monitored either.

Regardless they are the only official figures that Ireland has about suspected side-effects. And they suggest that the number of severe adverse side-effects is small relative to the overall number of people who’ve been vaccinated.

There are fears about the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines causing clots in younger people and the National Immunisation Advisory Committee has recommended that these shots be given to older people as a result.

However these clots are incredibly rare. There have been no reported deaths in Ireland as a result of either of these vaccines and very few elsewhere.

It is misleading to suggest that vaccines are causing a high number of of deaths or serious adverse effects in people.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G. Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”"

The public health social and economic toll has been unprecedented in recent decades. As of mid-May 2021 more than 168 million people have been infected and 3.5 million have died of the disease. Based on estimated excess mortality for 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) recently indicated that the death toll is likely higher.

While this global crisis has unraveled social life across countries the equally devastating decades-old pandemic of tobacco use has continued unbated to claim lives and make people sick as it is causally linked to diseases of nearly all organs of the body. Around 25% of all heart disease deaths and 80% of lung cancer deaths are caused by smoking and many others are caused by exposure to secondhand smoke for example.

A different but devastating pandemic

Cigarette smoking is not only the most common form of tobacco use but one of the leading preventable risk factors for premature mortality worldwide  killing more than 8 million people a year including users and non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke.

Country evidence from China Italy and other countries suggests that smokers have higher odds of progression in COVID-19 severity and death compared to non-smokers. There are also significant health care costs for treating the diseases caused by tobacco use as well as the indirect economic costs that result from tobacco-attributable morbidity and mortality--on average smokers die 10 years earlier than nonsmokers which represents a major human capital loss in countries.

The above numbers point to an inescapable reality: tobacco use kills more people yearly than COVID-19. Far worse tobacco smoking is estimated to have killed 100 million people in the 20th Century and estimates suggest one billion people could die from smoking this century if no action is taken.

Although with delays and inadequacies and after much suffering this past year governments international agencies and communities have come to the realization that to suppress the spread of SARS-CoV-2 the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 disease and overcome the social and economic disruption it brought a coordinated well-organized and sustained global response is the only way out of this crisis.

Addressing the tobacco scourge with urgency

Similarly based on the painful lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic we cannot remain complacent in thinking that tobacco use is just another “endemic” condition in our communities and that this addiction will never go away. We must recognize however that this challenge is not an easy one to tackle and will require a sustained effort over the medium-term given the economic power of the tobacco industry. This becomes clear when one understands that in nominal terms the worldwide sales revenue of all tobacco products is forecast to increase on average by 2.5% per year between 2012 and 2025 eventually reaching US$888 billion by 2025 generating gigantic profits for the tobacco industry. It is not surprising to learn then from a Credit Suisse report that one dollar invested in tobacco stocks in 1900 was worth $6.3 million by 2010 165 times greater than the average industry.

As Prof. Chris Whitty England’s chief medical officer observed in a recent lecture “tobacco companies get people addicted in young age and then keep them addicted to something which they know will kill them” to maintain their profit shares. But we know how to address the tobacco scourge.

Indeed the 2005 Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) the first global treaty negotiated under the auspices of the WHO that has been ratified by 182 countries with more than 90% of the world population offers a menu of effective demand and supply reduction measures.

Key measures range from raising taxes on tobacco products to increase prices and reduce consumption and health risks while mobilizing additional tax revenue that enhances fiscal capacity of countries to fund priority investments and programs that benefit all; regulations to protect people from exposure to tobacco smoke in public places; comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising promotion and sponsorship; to interventions for strengthening governance arrangements to deal with illicit tobacco trade across the supply chain.

While the FCTC is a solid framework for tobacco control full implementation of some of its provisions at the country level continues to lag behind.

Commit to quit

I think that to celebrate this year’s World No Tobacco Day under the theme “Commit to Quit” it is apt to raise our collective voices to demand that countries worldwide support at the highest political levels the adoption and the full implementation of FCTC provisions to end the scourge of tobacco use and nicotine addiction. To this I would add the support that needs to be provided to initiatives such as Tobacco Free Portfolio which involves working collaboratively with the world’s largest financial organizations to implement tobacco-free finance policies—spanning lending investment and insurance.

The World Bank Group (WBG) has also been assisting countries to confront the development threat posed by tobacco use. The unambiguous Operational Directive 4.76 of 1999 mandates that the WBG does not lend directly to tobacco production processing or marketing; provide grants for investment in these activities; or guarantee investments loans or credits for these industries . WBG policy advice technical assistance and operations support tobacco tax increases to protect the population from health risks and to mobilize additional public revenue to aid in the post-pandemic recovery.

There is no time to lose. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the potential devastating impact of unattended public health social and environmental risks and their spillover effects in a fast-changing interconnected world. The sobering experience bestowed upon all of us by the still ongoing pandemic clearly illustrates the high price that societies pay for inaction in dealing with global challenges old and new. Tobacco use is a decades-old pandemic that needs to be suppressed once and for all across the world as a moral public health and development imperative.

For those like me who have lost loved ones due to lung cancer and other tobacco-related diseases preventing smoking and the use of e-cigarettes by young people to make the next generation tobacco free is not only the right thing to do; more importantly it represents the type of concerted global effort that is required to confront major societal risks that could undermine the development of healthy productive and more inclusive and equitable societies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxzdGFyLmNvbS9uZXdzLWNvbW1lbnRhcnkvMjAyMS8wNS8zMC8yMTAxODk1L2NvbW1lbnRhcnktaG93LXRvYmFjY28taW5kdXN0cnktd3JvdGUtZmFrZS1uZXdzLXBsYXlib29r0gF5aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGhpbHN0YXIuY29tL25ld3MtY29tbWVudGFyeS8yMDIxLzA1LzMwLzIxMDE4OTUvY29tbWVudGFyeS1ob3ctdG9iYWNjby1pbmR1c3RyeS13cm90ZS1mYWtlLW5ld3MtcGxheWJvb2svYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Commentary: How the tobacco industry wrote the ‘fake news’ playbook,"Commentary: How the tobacco industry wrote the ‘fake news’ playbook

A specialist checks the quality of cigars that pass through a conveyor belt at the Bigott cigar company as part of the process for the manufacture of cigars in Caracas on February 19 2021.

In case you didn’t know there’s a website dedicated to 14 million documents that expose the tobacco industry’s history of lying manipulation and propaganda.

The Truth Tobacco Industry Documents  formerly known as the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library (housed under the University of California San Francisco) contain internal corporate documents produced as part of a lawsuit brought by US States against seven major tobacco industry organizations between 1994 and 1998.

The States asked the industry to reimburse health care expenditures related to tobacco-related illnesses. The tobacco companies were forced to pay large sums of money to the States after years of trying to hide industry documents. They also lied under oath about the addictive nature of cigarettes. The master settlement agreement from this litigation required millions of tobacco industry internal documents to be made public.

The Truth Tobacco Industry Documents Library is part of a larger archive that includes documents on drugs food fossil fuel and chemicals: all industries that influence public health. The tobacco industry is noteworthy however for consistently being cited as the author of the post-truth playbook and for being the most successful example so far of how to utilize emotion misdirection and propaganda to trump facts and hard science.

For the tobacco industry disinformation propaganda and 'fake news' are tried-and-tested tactics and strategies merely rehashed for modern audiences. They successfully confused manipulated and lied to the public then; here’s how they’re doing it now.

Step 1: Hire PR agencies

When epidemiologists in the 1950sbegan to clearly link cigarettes to cancer it seemed the tobacco industry was finished. Readers’ Digest in 1953 even published a landmark article about it titled “Cancer by the carton.”

At that time the tobacco industry—which engaged doctors in its ads then and already knew the dangers of smoking by its own research—could have at least acted in precaution and stopped promoting cigarettes.

But what they did instead was hire a PR agency. They met with PR agency Hill & Knowlton in 1953 where PR guru John Hill suggested a simple public relations strategy that proved to be effective for years to come: establish confidence and create public reassurance during that interim when “scientific doubts must remain” the end goal of which was “to free Americans from the guilty fear that is going to arise deep in their biological depth… every time they light a cigarette.”

They capitalized on guilt—an all-too-common emotion—and responded with confidence and reassurance. “A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers” is one such example.The advertising statement released by tobacco companies on 1954 spun the issue by reassuring the public (“We believe the products we make are not injurious to health”) casting doubt on the links to cancer (“These experiments [on mice] are not regarded as conclusive in the field of scientific research”) and by casting the tobacco companies as concerned stakeholders even as they deny scientific claims (“We always have and always will cooperate closely with those whose task it is safeguard the public health”).

Today tobacco companies are working hard to rehabilitate their reputations. Philip Morris International’s (PMI) current campaign says itis designing a “smoke-free” future. Another campaign in the context of IQOS (a heated tobacco product) says “this changes everything” (trademarked). PR agencies still partner with tobacco companies to brainstorm modern and creative ways to get this message across. The head scratcher: they still organize parties concerts and other promotions to continue selling cigarettes.

PMI’s recent white paper also discusses “Trust in a COVID-19 world”. It states: “We understand that many people trust neither Philip Morris International (PMI) nor the tobacco industry in general…we accept that earning trust will take time.” The white paper noticeably fails to mention why people lost trust in the first place: because Big Tobacco has failed to live up to its promise in 1954 that if they “had any thought or knowledge that in any way we were selling a product harmful to consumers we would stop business tomorrow.”

Tomorrow? The harm has been long established and it’s 2021.

Step 2: Form front groups

As stated in the Truth Tobacco documents Hill & Knowlton’s strategy for crisis management included the formation of a Tobacco Industry Research Committee (TIRC)comprised of scientists and educators. This committee was no more than a PR strategy. One of the committee’s goals was “to bring public attention to the fact that there is now no conclusive proof that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer and other serious problems of human health.” This it did through the publication “Tobacco and Health” which was delivered to 500000 doctors and scientists and had one key message: “the anti-cigarette theory has not been really proved.”

“No conclusive proof”? “Not really proved”? It was 1954 and by then the evidence was overwhelming against cigarette smoking and its confirmed link to cancer a matter recognized even by national government agencies. Not only this in the years following the creation of the committee tobacco industry scientists had also confirmed the causal link between smoking and cancer.

The TIRC was also tasked to “reassure” the “millions of people who derive pleasure and satisfaction from smoking… that every scientific means will be used to get the facts as soon as possible.” Yet the tobacco industry subsequently admitted the TIRC “did not look right” as it made ‘partisan’ arguments on behalf of the industry and simultaneously sponsored research that was supposedly objective. Thus tobacco companies agreed to form The Tobacco Institute a separate organization for information and PR purposes.

Today the tobacco industry has pervasively expanded its influence beyond research committees. However documenting these front groups remain a challenge because corporate transparency in matters of public interest is not yet the norm. But to start this journal article lists front groups and third parties documented to have received tobacco industry funding for operations in Southeast Asia and government entities with conflicts of interest with the tobacco industry.

Spoiler alert: the Philippines’ Inter-Agency Committee-Tobacco is in the list.

Step 3: Take advantage of ignorance and doubt

The study of how ignorance is produced deliberately is called “agnotology.”It was coined by Robert Proctor a Stanford University historian whose field of study was started by his observations of the tobacco industry.

Think about that for a while: the tobacco industry inspired studies on how ignorance and doubt are deliberately produced in society.

In the Truth Tobacco documents there’s amemo where a tobacco company executive proposes a new strategy to “improve the case for cigarettes” in 1969 wherein doubt is a “product” and “truth” is a mere message:

“Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the ‘body of fact’ that exists in the mind of the general public….Doubt is also the limit of our ‘product’. Unfortunately we cannot take a position directly opposing the anti-cigarette forces and say that cigarettes are a contributor to good health. No information that we have supports such a claim.”

And on using one instance of “truth” to “dominate” controversy:

“Truth is our message because of its power to withstand a conflict and sustain a controversy. If in our pro-cigarette efforts we stick to well documented fact we can dominate a controversy and operate with the confidence of justifiable self-interest.”

The memo goes on to outline next steps: using “test markets” and employing surveys to measure public opinion so the tobacco company can recalibrate—not the contents of their products—but their cigarette ads.

Today tobacco companies exploit their delayed admission that cigarettes are harmful even if this has been established more than 60 years ago. That fact is the “truth” part of their current messaging—yes cigarettes are harmful. But this admission is always followed by a promotion among others for their heated tobacco products (HTPs) which they say is “a better alternative to smoking” (even as they also know that the best choice is to quit or not smoke at all). They create doubt today on how the public should perceive their new products which is evident when one compares PMI’s statements to the US FDA’s statements on IQOS for example:

PMI’s press release on the US FDA allowing the sale of IQOS focuses on how this is a “public health milestone” even if…



The US FDA took pains to say that even as it authorized the marketing of IQOS as “modified risk tobacco products” to see if it will benefit the health of the population these products are “not safe nor FDA approved.” The US FDA even added that: “It is important to note that these products are not safe so people especially young people who do not currently use tobacco products should not start using them or any other tobacco product”(emphasis by the US FDA).It is important that PMI was also required to conduct postmarket surveillance and studies to determine whether this authorization continues to be appropriate including assessing the potential for increased use among the youth.

If one carefully studies the US FDA statements and what they stress as compared to the PMI press release one can see how the latter spins the former. While it is true that the US FDA allowed the marketing of IQOS as modified risk tobacco products PMI immediately jumped the gun and spun this as a “public health milestone” creating doubt on whether the products are harmful or not (it is says the FDA). The inevitable result is confusion. Confusion causes delay and this delay allows the tobacco industry to get ahead and increase its profits.

There is no public health milestone here as the products are clearly not safe. Remember: the true public health milestone would’ve been Big Tobacco fulfilling its promise to stop selling cigarettes.

Is doubt still the product of the tobacco industry? Yes.For more information on how it markets its new products to confuse the public see the report on PMI’s “Smoke-Free World” campaign and its next generation “harm reduction” products titled “Addiction at any cost.” A notable finding is how PMI is using the term “smoke-free” to confuse the public such as when it co-opts grassroots movements pushing for legislation for truly smoke-free environments (e.g. the Philippine Smoke-Free Movement).

Step 4: Distract and trivialize

The tobacco industry has bombarded the media with press releases and “expert” opinions meant to sway public opinion on cigarettes and “harm reduction” or “reduced risk” products.

Advocates of the industry frequently distract and trivialize issues. A recent example of distraction and trivialization: a harm reduction advocate discrediting the World Health Organization and the Department of Health and twisting the rules on foreign aid in order to place the tobacco industry in a better light. The industry to distract from its own conflict of interest with public health invents conflicts of interest.

It is easy to be captivated by these tactics and strategies until we are reminded of the bottomline: millions of human lives and billions in healthcare costs lost over tobacco-related diseases while the industry concocts the next best strategy to sell more cigarettes and other harmful products.

The truth is boring but it is the truth nonetheless: the tobacco industry as long as it sells and promotes cigarettes and smoking can never claim that it prioritizes public health.

It boils down to trust. The lies the propaganda and the deceitful manipulation are not things of the past for the tobacco industry. Because it continues to sow doubt manipulate emotion and play around with public opinion—reflecting the problem of ‘fake news’ disinformation and propaganda today—I don’t trust the tobacco industry.

Do you?

After a dismal Serie A season which saw them slip down to 4th Juventus have already started preparing for the new season. As part of it club legend Andrea Pirlo was removed as the manager to be replaced by their former manager Max Allegri.

Along with Pirlo sporting director Fabio Paratici has also being shown the door after more than a decade of service to the club. If il Giornale via TuttoJuve are to be believed club legend Paulo Nedved could also follow the exit door. The Czech great is considered close to the Agnelli family and is an important member of the Juventus board.

Most significantly as per la Gazzetta dello Sport via Calciomercato former Ferrari F1 team principal Maurizio Arrivabene could be appointed the Chief Executive Officer of the football club.

The Agnelli family controls both the football and F1 teams and Arrivabene is considered to be a close confidant of Andrea Agnelli. He was the Ferrari team boss between 2014 and 2018 following which Mattia Binotto was brought in.

If this holds true then Arrivabene will effectively replace Giuseppe Marotta who was the last CEO until 2018. The highly sought-after executive is currently the CEO of Italian champions Inter Milan. Sassuolo’s Giovanni Carnevali is also being tipped to be an option to be Marotta’s successor.

Arrivabene has also worked with Philip Morris International one of the key partners of the Ferrari Formula 1 team and is a member of the Juventus Board of Directors.

On Sunday it continued to skip over Scott Dixon.

The six-time NTT IndyCar Series champion was once again the favorite to win the Indianapolis 500 but the 2008 Indianapolis 500 winner was once again denied a chance at a second win in the biggest race on the planet.

The four-time Indianapolis 500 pole winner was executing his game plan perfectly by yielding the lead at the start of the race to Colton Herta. He was content to run third behind Rinus VeeKay and Herta during the first fuel stint.

It was during the first green flag pit stop sequence that things changed. Dixon was attempting to stretch a few extra laps out of his tank of fuel when Stefan Wilson competing in his first IndyCar Series race since the 2018 Indianapolis 500 spun out and crashed entering the pits on lap 33. That brought out the caution and closed the pits.

Dixon Alexander Rossi Alex Palou Tony Kanaan Jack Harvey and Simon Pagenaud had to take emergency service on pit road to keep from running out of fuel. When Dixon pitted his engine quit and would not refire.

By the time his No. 9 PNC Bank Chip Ganassi Racing Honda crew got Dixon’s engine to refire Dixon and Rossi were both one lap down.

Dixon was stuck in 32nd and it appeared his hopes at a second Indianapolis 500 were dashed. Both Dixon and Rossi decided to top off their fuel tanks in hopes that if they got back on the lead lap the race would come back to them.

Dixon made it back on the lead lap and even back to the lead from laps 158 to 162 when he had to make his final pit stop. Unfortunately the fact that the race ran green from lap 125 to the checkered flag foiled Dixon’s strategy.

Instead of celebrating his second Indianapolis 500 victory Dixon finished 17th. The double-points race also knocked him out of the NTT IndyCar Series points lead. He trails teammate Palou by 36 points as the series takes next weekend off before resuming with the Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix at Belle Isle in two weeks.

“I don’t know what to say” Dixon said. “Unfortunately with the yellow we shouldn’t have been running it that close on the fuel and it caught some of us out. I still took the penalty because if we ran out of fuel we would have lost more than one lap.

“It was a rough day. We tried to go off strategy needed some luck there but nothing went our way.

“It was an unfortunate day for us. The car felt great we tried to stretch it on the fuel and that got us in trouble.”

Dixon once again had the strongest car but circumstances kept him from winning another Indy 500.

“That’s how it goes” Dixon said. “It’s cool to see Helio Castroneves win. He is very deserving. To be a part of that moment in our current era is very special. This place is tricky.

“The frustrating part is it came so early; I had a lot of time to calm down. I had a lot of laps to just cruise around.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZm94NTkuY29tL25ld3MvaW5keS01MDAvbGl2ZS11cGRhdGVzLTEwNXRoLXJ1bm5pbmctb2YtdGhlLWluZGlhbmFwb2xpcy01MDAv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3g1OS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmR5LTUwMC9saXZlLXVwZGF0ZXMtMTA1dGgtcnVubmluZy1vZi10aGUtaW5kaWFuYXBvbGlzLTUwMC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,(Archive) LIVE UPDATES | 105th Running of the Indianapolis 500,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://fox59.com/news/indy-500/live-updates-105th-running-of-the-indianapolis-500/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZm94NTkuY29tL25ld3MvaW5keS01MDAvbGl2ZS11cGRhdGVzLTEwNXRoLXJ1bm5pbmctb2YtdGhlLWluZGlhbmFwb2xpcy01MDAv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3g1OS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmR5LTUwMC9saXZlLXVwZGF0ZXMtMTA1dGgtcnVubmluZy1vZi10aGUtaW5kaWFuYXBvbGlzLTUwMC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

It wasn’t about what people thought or said but it was about her fighting spirit and support from her parents - who though crippled by poverty blessed her with the life lessons on which no price tag can be affixed.

Born and raised in the deep rural community of Watt Town St Ann Hyacinth Gordon-Clarke and her five siblings accepted their circumstances but lived boldly each day knowing that their willpower was going to make the difference.

“My father was a peasant farmer and my mother a housewife. Thus the challenge of raising six children without an income was extremely arduous. It was hard for my parents to provide the simple tools for primary school but going to church and school was not an option. It was a must. Even if it meant wearing your school uniform to Sunday School home was not the place to stay on a Sunday. From an early age it was inculcated in me that salvation and education make the difference in one’s life” she said.

Satisfied showered with love good values and taught to have the right attitude Gordon-Clarke worked hard to be successful in her Common Entrance Examinations and was able to secure her top choice - a place at the York Castle High School.

But her parents’ financial struggles put a temporary damper on her wheels of success.

“Unfortunately due to my parents’ financial constraints I became a dropout. My parents were unable to find me bus fare lunch money books etc. However that delay did not deter me from realising my dream of being the first poor barefooted girl to attend Watt Town All-Age School now primary and infant.”

There was an unquenchable fire in her belly to not allow the odds to dictate to her and it was this fire that pushed her to bloom where she was planted matriculating to tertiary institutions being qualified for positions that were once rungs above her and becoming a principal at her alma mater among other accomplishments.

“…It was my ambition to become someone of prominence in this life. I focused on God Almighty along with the 4 Ps for success; purpose passion planning and persistence. If purpose is not understood abuse is inevitable. I knew God Almighty was my manufacturer and wanted me to succeed. His plan for my life is to prosper me and give me a hope. I made the right choices focused on good values stick to positivity and persevere.”

Next week we will share with you how Gordon-Clarke used her will to find her a way and moved on to accomplishing much more than she thought she could.

Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.

Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

[Update: Since publication of this article Maya Wiley has picked up several more endorsements including from the New York Progressive Action Network and Jim Owles Liberal Democratic Club which had both endorsed Dianne Morales State Senator Julia Salazar the Working Families Party and Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman among others some of whom had previously endorsed Scott Stringer]

Moderate candidates Eric Adams and Andrew Yang have been leading in the Democratic mayoral primary while two prominent progressives Dianne Morales and Scott Stringer have stumbled. Some progressive groups and activists are now placing their hopes in Maya Wiley to consolidate undecided left-leaning voters and disaffected Morales and Stringer supporters as they seek to ensure that someone who shares their values and vision becomes the next mayor of New York City.

A recent poll by Fontas Advisors and Core Decision Analytics placed Adams the two-term Brooklyn borough president at the front of the race with 13% of the vote with former Democratic presidential candidate Yang tied in second place with former sanitation commissioner Kathryn Garcia also generally and relatively speaking a moderate with 8% of the vote. Wiley former counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio was at 5%. Though the poll found 50% of voters were undecided it also looked at whether those voters leaned towards specific candidates. Of those about half picked a preference after which support for Adams increased to 18% Yang to 13% and Garcia to 11%. Wiley and Morales both got 9%. In another recent survey the surging Garcia was ahead for the first time in any of the limited public polling available with Adams second and Yang third.

The more progressive candidates in the race are struggling. Late last month Stringer the two-term city comptroller was accused of sexual assault and harassment by a former campaign volunteer from his 2001 run for public advocate. He denied the allegations but his campaign lost several prominent supporters some of whom have yet to decide whether they will back another candidate and he saw a rash of negative media attention though he has added multiple new labor union endorsements in recent weeks.

Morales a former nonprofit executive running furthest to the left in the race got an apparent boost from Stringer’s scandal and had been gaining momentum that also accompanied Wiley’s struggles to break out. But this past week Morales’ campaign imploded amid allegations of mistreatment of staffers lack of pay and health insurance for campaign workers overworking volunteers and poor management and union-busting by the candidate herself. Many have indicated that Morales whose historic progressive bona fides have been challenged over her past support for Governor Andrew Cuomo and charter schools was not living up to the stated values of her campaign platform. And that campaign crisis came after revelations that Morales had years ago gone along when being extorted by a crooked city employee who asked for a bribe from her to address a water bill then she subsequently lied repeatedly to city investigators.

With both the Stringer and Morales campaigns in crisis of varying degrees and their potential paths to victory in the primary looking additionally daunting it leaves Wiley a civil rights attorney and former chair of the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) dealing with police misconduct as the progressive candidate looking least tarnished and perhaps most capable of cobbling together the votes needed to eke out a victory in the June 22 primary which will be decided with ranked-choice voting for the first time.

Wiley herself made that assertion on Friday when asked by a reporter about Stringer’s and Morales’ struggling campaigns during a door-knocking stop in central Brooklyn. “I'm focused on winning on June 22 and becoming the first woman mayor of the city and I am the progressive and the only progressive in this race that can win it” she said.

Wiley has previously said that Morales would be her own second choice on the ranked-choice ballot but did not address a question from a reporter about whether she had chosen another candidate. Months ago Morales had named Wiley as her number two but then changed her answer to undecided. Shaun Donovan former federal housing secretary under President Obama has also been vying for progressive votes but he has struggled in the scattered polling. Donovan has repeatedly named Wiley as his second choice.

Despite his troubles Stringer has insisted he can still prevail in the primary that he has been preparing for over the course of a lifetime in New York politics. Stringer has consistently polled better than Wiley and has far more money to spend down the stretch of the campaign. His campaign has repeatedly argued he is “the progressive candidate who has the support—built up over decades of service—along with the resources behind him to win this race” as his campaign communications director Tyrone Stevens tweeted earlier this month.

Stringer has been campaigning aggressively in recent weeks including rolling out new policy plans and adding labor endorsements even as many question whether he can break into communities of color as he had planned before losing a number of endorsers who were supposed to help him in that effort. Wiley is now surely hoping that some of those endorsers head her way.

Only winning progressive votes will not be enough for victory in the primary but for any of the more progressive candidates to win they will need significant first-place backing from progressives while also appealing to more moderate voters particularly voters of color.

Some progressive elected officials activists and groups have been reevaluating how to approach the primary as the race has tightened; Yang Adams and Garcia all appear toward the front of the pack; and the Stringer and Morales scandals have unfolded.

“I think coalescing around the strongest progressive left in the race makes a lot of sense. I recommend putting Maya Wiley at the top of the ballot at this point” said Shannon Stagman who is co-lead organizer of Empire State Indivisible a progressive activist group but was not speaking on behalf of the group which has endorsed both Wiley and Morales. “I also think it's important to make strong decisions about who not to rank. I personally as a progressive do not think that voters who want a progressive in office should rank Andrew Yang or Eric Adams anywhere on their ballot"" Stagman added.

As with Empire State Indivisible Wiley and Morales share support (either via co-endorsements or with one of them as the number one and the other as the number two endorsee) from many of the same organizations including the Working Families Party Make The Road Action The Jewish Vote Community Voices Heard Power New York Progressive Action Network Indivisible Harlem Union of Arab Women and Higher Heights For America PAC. But at least one group that planned to back both candidates withheld its support for Morales in the wake of her campaign upheaval.

Our Revolution a national progressive grassroots group had teased that it would endorse Wiley and Morales on Thursday. But only Wiley made the cut. “While both Scott Stringer and Dianne Morales are progressive unfortunately they're flawed candidates who are running flawed campaigns” said Joseph Geevarghese executive director of Our Revolution. “And in this moment the best shot for progressives to capture City Hall is to unite around Maya Wiley's campaign.”

Unlike the “self-inflicted wounds” of the Stringer and Morales’ campaigns Geevarghese said Wiley has run a “competent campaign.” “Progressives should be pragmatic in this moment and I think just the competence of her campaign is something that progressives should double down on” he added.

On June 2 the New York Progressive Action Network suspended its endorsement of Morales and gave its undivided support to Wiley. The Jim Owles Liberal Democratic Club also rescinded its earlier endorsement of Morales on June 1 and announced that it was supporting Wiley instead. Wiley was also the first-choice pick for the New York State Nurses Association which announced its endorsement on June 3 while picking Eric Adams as their second choice. And on June 4 State Senator Julia Salazar and Assembly Member Maritza Davila both of whom had previously backed Stringer threw their support behind Wiley as did Assembly Member Emily Gallagher.

While Wiley has by many accounts run a solid campaign including picking up endorsements like from the large and powerful 1199 SEIU health care workers and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries among many others her candidacy has not taken off and there is limited time left to really make a move. Some have blamed muddled messaging and a somewhat ill-defined campaign led by a candidate who too often falls back on vague and lawerly remarks. As the New York Times editorial board endorsed Garcia it gave little praise to Wiley the former MSNBC analyst who was hoping to get a boost with Times readers and secure more support among white progressive voters she will need to have a chance to win.

But Wiley was widely seen as performing strongly in the first official televised debate. Her campaign has been releasing television ads that give at least a somewhat clearer message of what her campaign is centered on -- opportunities for young people police reform and accountability racial equity good jobs -- and has enough money to remain competitive while 1199 has also pledged an independent expenditure on her behalf. And she’s taken other recent steps to appeal to both the white progressives and Latino and Black voters of various political stripes that she is trying to bring together including new endorsements from Gloria Steinem and Cecile Richards a Latino-focused policy platform released with endorser Rep. Nydia Velázquez and door-knocking in Prospect Heights with City Council candidate Crystal Hudson.

That Stringer and Morales have faltered is also a challenge for groups that have been attempting to create a progressive front to defeat the likes of Yang and Adams. “Yang and Adams create a unique threat to the livelihood of a lot of New Yorkers” said Charles Khan from Our City PAC a political action committee formed to promote progressive candidates in this year’s election. “They're kind of wholly-owned subsidiaries of special interests real estate financiers and tech folks right now so we're also definitely focused on making sure the public is aware of who they are what they stand for who's backing them as they weigh their options for the elections.""

Khan said the group is not backing any single progressive candidate but attempting to raise the floor for all progressives. But their hopes of building a “unity ticket” have sputtered with the progressive mayoral candidates.

“The best thing we can do from a strategy standpoint on ranked-choice voting at this point is a unity ticket. And that's why I said continue to push progressives and progressive values” he said. “If everyone coalesced around Wiley that may get her more first-place votes but she needs to do well as a second choice and third choice and fourth choice in order to really win.”

561.658.4077 • Jupiter.greatflorida.com",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS9uby1ldmlsLWZvb2RzLXVuaW9uLWJ1c3RpbmctbmxyYi12ZWdhbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Capitalists Exploit Workers — Even When They're “Socialists”,"After No Evil Foods settled with Jon Reynolds and Cortne Roche the money went quickly.

The two workers say that the socialist-branded vegan food producer fired them last year for organizing on the job. They filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleging illegal retaliation and in September of 2020 the board found the allegations had merit issuing a federal complaint against the company for its violations of the law.

In October 2020 Reynolds and Roche settled with No Evil rather than take the company to court. The terms of the settlement are that neither Reynolds nor Roche can return to the company no one admits fault and No Evil pays $20000 to Reynolds and $22500 to Roche.

“It didn’t last very long” says Roche of the payment. “I had to buy a car I had to pay rent.”

When I spoke to Reynolds and Roche last year not long after No Evil had fired them both they were adamant that while the company claimed it had let them go for social-distancing violations and dress-code violations respectively their termination in fact constituted illegal retaliation for organizing. They have not wavered in that belief.

“What they paid us over $40000 because they’re just handing out money now?” jokes Reynolds. The situation still smarts they explain because the company continues to deny it broke the law or busted the union. (No Evil did not respond to a request for comment.)

Workers at No Evil sought to organize the company’s Weaverville North Carolina facility with the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW). In response No Evil ran an anti-union campaign with workers at the production plant subjected to captive-audience meetings mandatory sessions in which employees listen to managers argue why they should oppose the union. No Evil employees said that the meetings lasted hours and took place as frequently as three times a week in the lead-up to the February union election. The result was a 43-15 vote against unionizing.

Acompany that describes itself as “revolutionary” engaging in union-busting is galling. No Evil sells items with names like “Comrade Cluck” (a vegan chicken product) and “El Zapatista” (a vegan chorizo product) so its opposition to unions surprised and outraged workers including Reynolds and Roche. Reynolds after all is vegan himself and he moved to the state to build a career at No Evil a company he believed shared his values.

In the aftermath of the settlement the argument has continued: No Evil still publicly denies that it did anything wrong leading Reynolds and Roche among others to continue discussing the events of last year.

“No one was fired for their interest in unions or hazard pay” reads a recent reply posted by No Evil’s Twitter account. “The NLRB cannot determine whether allegations are true without a hearing where witness and evidence are presented. No such hearing happened” reads another tweet.

In an interview with VegNews last August shortly before the NLRB found merit in the workers’ claims No Evil founders Sadrah Schadel and Mike Woliansky say “Everyone makes mistakes. Learning from them is essential. Striving to do better is what ‘No Evil’ is all about.”

No Evil has gone to unusual lengths to keep these workers’ claims quiet. The company got audio and video of captive-audience meetings removed from websites and podcasts by filing takedown requests on copyright and privacy grounds. The recordings were captured by workers present at the meetings and as an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) wrote in a letter to No Evil last October the company’s takedown notices appear to be “motivated not by genuine concern” for copyright but rather by a “desire to shut down criticism.” Workers say that after EFF warned the company against continuing to abuse copyright law No Evil toned down its efforts to drown out criticism on social media and ceased issuing takedown requests.

When asked how they feel about their decision to settle rather than going to trial Reynolds and Roche are ambivalent.

“I have mixed feelings because that’s their argument now: that it never went to court and they were never proven guilty of any wrongdoing” says Reynolds. Roche agrees noting that the decision was not made because they felt they would lose a trial — both say there is strong evidence of retaliation and believe they would’ve won — but because the process is both time- and resource-intensive. (After leaving No Evil both workers moved on to other low-wage jobs though Roche is currently unemployed after a stint first at Whole Foods where she was a temporary hire and then Chipotle where she says the $11-an-hour pay couldn’t justify the time and money spent on the commute.)

For workers experiencing employer retaliation Roches advises they take their bosses to trial. “Even if you lose it’s still an experience that very few people get to have which is a company being put on trial for violating workers’ rights. That doesn’t happen very often” she says.

In the VegNews interview No Evil’s founders also accuse workers like Reynolds and Roche of encouraging others to “endanger their lives and the safety of their young children.”

“It’s crazy because none of it’s true” says Meagan Sullivan who quit her job at No Evil in June 2020. Of the founders’ description of a “campaign of harassment and extortion” by former No Evil workers like herself — who are described as union “operatives” — Sullivan says “We’re just telling people what happened in our own experience working for the company.”

As for what the future holds for No Evil workers describe the plant’s rapid transformation with the installation of new machines and a reorganization of production. The company is backed by venture-capital firm Blue Horizon and is quickly expanding. No Evil products are now available in more than five thousand stores nationwide including Walmart.

“My speculation is that they plan to sell the company in a few years” says Sullivan. This is part of the reason the union drive happened when it did she explains. “I worry about the people who work there because now it’s up in the air and they don’t have any control over it.”

While Reynolds Roche and Sullivan are long gone from the company instability remains.

“When anybody sticks up for themselves they get fired” says Jordon Hoffman who worked as a production tech at No Evil until last month when he quit. Hoffman believes three people were fired the day he quit and that firings are a frequent occurrence. Even some of the managers who led the company’s anti-union campaign have since been fired.

“Imagine I was a totally different person and I’d said ‘I’m going to stick by management I want to be a company man’” says Reynolds of the termination of No Evil’s most loyal employees. “I’d have still gotten screwed over. They don’t have loyalty to anything except the bottom line and their investors. That speaks volumes about what kind of a company this is and about how it would go with any other company too. Loyalty doesn’t pay off to a company that busts unions.”

Or as Hoffman bluntly puts it “They really don’t give a fuck about us.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUuY29tL3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlLWlzc3Vlcy9rb2NoLWJyb3RoZXJzLWxvYmJ5aXN00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Surprised to Be a Koch Brothers Lobbyist,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.laprogressive.com/progressive-issues/koch-brothers-lobbyist on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUuY29tL3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlLWlzc3Vlcy9rb2NoLWJyb3RoZXJzLWxvYmJ5aXN00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

The WWE Hall of Famer appeared in WWE as Papa Shango (1992-1993) and Kama (1995-1998) before he became The Godfather in 1998. The Godfather’s controversial pimp gimmick received complaints from the Parents Television Council (PTC) so McMahon felt compelled to axe the character in 2000.

The Godfather became known as The Goodfather around that period of time. He also joined the WWE faction Right to Censor (RTC) a conservative group that parodied the PTC.

Speaking on Steve Austin’s ""Broken Skull Sessions"" show The Godfather said McMahon was reluctant to change his fun-loving gimmick.

“Hated it [working as The Goodfather] absolutely” The Godfather said. “This is the only time in wrestling where I did not like what I was doing. It was so hard. First of all Vince fought for me hard. He used to tell me ‘Charles [Charles Wright The Godfather’s real name] I’m trying man but they’re coming after you hard. I’m trying.’ If it was up to Vince he would have kept that gimmick going forever but he was taking a lot of heat for what I was doing. So he’s like ‘Well we’re gonna poke fun at this group for a minute and then try to get back to The Godfather.’”

Right to Censor (Steven Richards Bull Buchanan The Goodfather Val Venis and Ivory) debuted in July 2000 and disbanded in June 2001. The Godfather revived his former character in 2002 before he was released at the end of the year.

The Godfather explains why he stayed in WWE

After becoming The Goodfather The Godfather said he made the mistake of telling someone in WWE that he was seriously considering leaving the company.

In an attempt to make him stay Vince McMahon decided to book The Goodfather and Bull Buchanan as the new WWE Tag Team Champions.

“I think it got to Vince and you know how Vince is” The Godfather added. “Me being a loyal person to the company I’ve always been a loyal person he dropped the straps [tag titles] on us so I’m not gonna leave when he dropped the straps on us. So it kept me there longer.”

The Goodfather and Bull Buchanan won the WWE Tag Team Championship from The Hardy Boyz on RAW in November 2000. They held the titles for 34 days before they dropped the gold to Edge and Christian at Armageddon 2000.

The WWF were put under intense pressure from the PTC (Parents Television Council) to cease controversial gimmicks like The Godfather and Val Venis in mid-2000. Wright recalled being told he'd be part of a send-up faction - the Right To Censor (RTC) movement was born and Charles hated it.

On 'Broken Skull' Wright said that RTC was the only time he didn't like what he was doing in wrestling. He loved the other members of the group but he wasn't happy with the gig anymore. It felt like pulling teeth after a few years of fun and laughs as The Godfather and he wanted out.

Hilariously Vince stopped his departure by putting the Tag-Team Titles on him. That prolonged Charles' agony a little while longer. Looking back he was totally miserable as 'The Goodfather' and he doesn't mind being open about that torment now.

New Buyer Is Taking Preliminary Plans To Clarkstown Planners

By Tina Traster

Is it time to send that last lob at the West Rock Indoor Sports & Entertainment Complex at 21 Pralle Lane in Nanuet which over the last 12 years has been transformed from a tennis center into a multi-faceted facility pulling in more than $1 million annually in revenue?

That depends on whether a developer who is buying the complex to convert it to a self-storage facility gets greenlighted by Clarkstown’s planners and engineers who weigh in early on a project’s feasibility. The sports and entertainment center remains in operation.

The applicant Stephan Matri Jr. of 21 Pralle Owner LLC of Port Chester will appear before the Town of Clarkstown’s “Technical Advisory Committee” on Wednesday to propose the conversion of the existing structure into a self-storage facility. The West Rock complex is comprised of two large metal buildings connected by a smaller frame building in the center. The applicant wants to build a mezzanine level within the two large metal buildings – effectively adding a second level of around 70000 square feet of usable space. The applicant wants to demolish the connector building and rebuild a fully enclosed interior loading area that would service both the metal buildings’ “wings.” The project also calls for a 1000 square foot business office at the southwestern corner of the east wing.

The westerly side of the existing parking lot would be modified to provide access and turnaround for the interior loading area.

A variance is required for the floor area ratio (FAR): the maximum allowable FAR is 0.40 and the project proposes a FAR of 0.81 – twice as large.

The property is currently zoned LIO which allows for “mini-warehouses” as-of-right.

Stephan Matri Jr. is a principal at the Greenwich CT based The Renatus Group a privately held real estate investment and development company that has acquired in excess of $500mm in real estate assets. Renatus’ primary focus is the acquisition of value-add real estate consisting of income producing properties development projects and non-performing commercial real estate debt in the New York Tri-State area according to the website.

Review before TAC is intended to provide an introduction and overview of the proposed project to identify the required approvals and zoning requirements.

Over the past 12 years James Miller has transformed West Rock Indoor Sports & Entertainment Complex into a significant asset for the community. Like many challenged businesses West Rock soldiered through the pandemic by keeping its sports offerings on tap though its entertainment revenues which represent 33 percent of income were been gutted according to Miller.

In January RCBJ reported that Miller had reached out to Clarkstown town officials to tour the property to initiate discussion about what a private/public partnership could look like.

At the time of reporting the story Miller said “Our business is not for sale. We’re just having discussions about doing more together.”

Miller and town council members did agreed on one thing: the facility is unique to Rockland and the region. It has several facilities the town does not possess. It pays nearly $200000 in annual town county and school taxes and according to Clarktown town tax assessor its full market value is $4.3 million.

However there has been a proliferation in the building of self-storage facilities in Rockland and nationwide over the past several years. The facilities generate tax ratables but some argue that these passive uses do not contribute to street-level activity or vibrancy in commercial districts. Further self-storage facilities do not create many jobs or stimulate economic spinoff.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vVVMvd29tYW5zLWJvZHktZm91bmQtZHVmZmVsLWJhZy1oaWRkZW4taW5zaWRlLXN0b3JhZ2Uvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9Nzc5ODY3ODLSAWJodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9VUy93b21hbnMtYm9keS1mb3VuZC1kdWZmZWwtYmFnLWhpZGRlbi1pbnNpZGUtc3RvcmFnZS9zdG9yeT9pZD03Nzk4Njc4Mg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woman's body found in duffel bag hidden inside a storage unit for several months,"It is thought the victim's body could have been there since November 2020.

A man has been arrested after a woman’s body was found in a duffel bag that had been hidden inside of a storage unit for several months.

The incident began on May 12 when 64-year-old Debra Lynn Childers was reported missing to the Mohave County Sheriff’s Office by her son who lives out of state and had not heard from his mother in several months but knew that she lived in the Kingman and Golden Valley area of Arizona.

A police investigation into Childers who had reportedly been living out of her car found that a male had been withdrawing money from her bank account over the last several months but with no sign of Childers.

“During the week of May 24th KPD (Kingman Police Department) detectives began investigating the money withdrawals and attempting to identify the subject making the withdrawals” Kingman Police Department said in a statement. “It was also determined that this subject was driving the victim’s vehicle. There was immediate concern for Childers’ welfare.”

During the course of the investigation authorities were able to locate two storage units that belonged to Childers and served search warrants to inspect them on Friday May 28.

That is when the Kingman Police Department made the grisly discovery.

“Once inside detectives located a dead body believed to be Debra Childers” KPD said. “The body had been concealed in a large duffle bag and appeared to have been inside the storage unite for several months. Based on evidence and information investigators believe the body to be Debra Lynn Childers however official identification must be made by the Mohave County Medical Examiner’s Office.”

Childers’ family has been notified about the discovery of the body.

Brett Daniel Puett was arrested on May 28 2021 by the Kingman Police Department in Arizona and has been charged second degree murder after the body of Debra Lynn Childers 64 was found in a duffel bag inside a storage unit after her son reported her missing. Kingman Police Department/Facebook

Detectives have identified 35-year-old Brett Daniel Puett as the individual who had been driving her car and making withdrawals from Childers’ bank account over the previous several months and with the assistance of the Mohave County Sherriff’s Office as well as MAGNET detectives Puett was located and taken into custody without incident at approximately 5 p.m. on May 28 after he arrived to his own home driving Childers’ vehicle.

“Investigators learned that Puett and Childers met each other last summer while both had been living out of their vehicles” Kingman Police Department said. “Childers was shot and killed some time in November while Puett and Childers were sharing a room at a motel in … Kingman. It is believed that their relationship was platonic.”

Authotities say that Puett has since admitted his involvement in the killing and money withdrawals as well as transporting and concealing her body in the storage unit for several months.

Puett has been charged with felony charges of second degree murder abandonment and concealment of a dead body and fraudulent schemes and artifices.

No other additional suspects are being sought and Puett has been booked into the Mohave County Adult Detention Facility as the investigation continues.

While Qualcomm has an edge in the flagship section MediaTek is quite good with mid-range and entry-level chips. Most of the 2021 Android flagships use Qualcomm’s latest flagship processor Snapdragon 888. According to reports Qualcomm will release the Snapdragon 888 Pro chip in the second half of this year.

Recently a “Qualcomm Lahaina” device appeared on the GeekBench running sub-site. This may be an engineering machine with Snapdragon 888 Pro. However the report claims that this chip is the Snapdragon 888+ SoC. The X1 super-large core has been increased from 2.84GHz to 3.0GHz the other core frequencies remain unchanged. The Prime CPU core (Cortex-X1) will be the one with 3GHz the 3x Performance Cores (Cortex-A78) will have 2.42 clock speeds and the 4x Efficiency CPUs (Cortex-A55) will go up to 1.8GHz. The CPU scores 1171 points in single-core tests and 3704 in the multi-core department. However there is no information on the GPU frequency. At present the score is not much different from the normal version.

According to Weibo blogger @DCS there are Snapdragon 888 4G Snapdragon 888 WiFi and Snapdragon 888 Pro devices. The blogger also said that these devices will be available this year. They will also decentralize the mid-end of Snapdragon 888.

Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 specification

The Snapdragon 888 uses 1 x 2.84GHz (ARM’s latest Cortex X1 core) + 3 x 2.4GHz (Cortex A78) + 4 x 1.8GHz (Cortex A55) architecture. The GPU is Adreno 660 and it supports WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2.

As the latest product of Snapdragon 8 series SD888 integrates Qualcomm’s third-generation 5G modem and radio frequency system – Snapdragon X60 which supports all major global millimeter wave and Sub-6GHz frequency bands as well as 5G carrier aggregation global multi-SIM card functions Independent (SA) and non-independent (NSA) networking modes and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS).

The sixth-generation Qualcomm AI engine integrated on the Snapdragon 888 5G mobile platform includes a newly designed Qualcomm Hexagon processor with a performance of 26 trillion operations per second (26 TOPS). In terms of games it integrates the third-generation Snapdragon Elite Gaming. Also Qualcomm claims that this chip brings the most significant performance improvement ever made by Qualcomm Adreno GPU. It also comes with a 2nd generation Qualcomm Sensing Hub which “incorporates low-power always-on AI processing for intuitive intelligent features.”

In terms of camera performance the Spectra ISP of SD888 supports faster billion-pixel-level processing speeds. Users can process 2.7 billion pixels per second to take photos and videos. This is about 120 frames per second and each frame is 12MP. The processing speed is up to 35% higher than the previous generation platform.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vYmVlYm9tLmNvbS9xdWFsY29tbS1zbmFwZHJhZ29uLTg4OC1wbHVzLWdlZWtiZW5jaC1yZXN1bHRzL9IBRmh0dHBzOi8vYmVlYm9tLmNvbS9xdWFsY29tbS1zbmFwZHJhZ29uLTg4OC1wbHVzLWdlZWtiZW5jaC1yZXN1bHRzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888+ Passes Through Geekbench,"Qualcomm’s current flagship chipset as you might be aware is the Snapdragon 888 5G. Announced in December last year the chipset has been the default choice for smartphone makers while launching an Android flagship phone this year. Well it looks like that pattern is about to change soon as an early Geekbench listing of the alleged Snapdragon 888+ has popped up online.

Snapdragon 888+ Shows up on Geekbench

As is the case with ‘+’ variants of Qualcomm’s chipsets the Snapdragon 888+ will be an overclocked version of the Snapdragon 888. Notably the extreme performance Cortex-X1 core is clocked at 3.0GHz as opposed to 2.84GHz on the regular 888 5G. Apart from that we’ve got four low-power Cortex-A55 cores clocked at 1.8GHz and three high-performance Cortex-A78 cores clocked at 2.42GHz.

Overall the listing shows that the chipset has a 1171 single-core and 3704 multi-core score. To recall as we saw in the Snapdragon 888 benchmarks article the Snapdragon 888 has a benchmark score of 1133 in single-core and 3785 in the multi-core segment.

Meanwhile tipster Digital Chat Station hints that Qualcomm may release as many as three variants in the Snapdragon 888 series. This includes a 4G variant a Wi-Fi variant and a Pro variant. From the looks of it Samsung may use these chipsets on the upcoming Galaxy Tab S8 tablets.

Apart from these scores there’s no information on the chipset just yet. Going by past Snapdragon chipsets in the ‘+’ series we could also expect GPU improvements with the upcoming mobile chipset. Since the Geekbench listings have already started to show up Qualcomm may make the chipset official in the coming weeks. We’ll be covering it when that happens so stay tuned for more updates.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcmR3YXJlem9uZS5jb20uc2cvdGVjaC1uZXdzLXF1YWxjb21tLXNuYXBkcmFnb24tN2MtZ2VuMi1wcmVtaXVtLWZlYXR1cmVzLWNoZWFwZXItdGhhbi14ODYtbm90ZWJvb2tz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qualcomm's updated Snapdragon 7c presses for premium features at 40% the price of x86 notebooks,"Qualcomm's updated Snapdragon 7c presses for premium features at 40% of the price of x86 notebooks

Note: This article was first published on 24 May 2021.

Always-on always-ready always-connected instantaneous performance with long battery life and cellular (4G) connectivity is still a tough expectation of a typical AMD/Intel-power x86 notebook unless you look at systems upwards of US$900. Locally that’s anywhere between S$1.2k to $1.5k depending on configurations and platform expectations.

Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Compute Platforms which first debuted in 2018 (and had subsequent platform updates in 2019) are designed to address this pain point of cost and efficiency; if any mobile phone can offer the above experiences at such low costs why can’t notebooks match this without an expensive price tag?

Today Qualcomm debuted their value-level offering the Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 Compute platform to upgrade entry-level laptops to offer thin quiet cool and light computing with lighting fast responsiveness great audio and video experiences to address the rapid uptake of video conferences and virtual meetings of any kind great connectivity AI and security acceleration built-in all from just a US$350 price point.

To translate that means getting a super-effective productivity machine at under S$500 which is quite possibly difficult to imagine. Just taking a look across notebook offerings at that price point these usually run Chrome OS to safe on system resources because more often than not they would be equipped with Intel Pentium and Celeron processors which are woefully inadequate to maintain the high-quality experience that you would get from a notebook three times that cost and yet that’s what the Snapdragon Compute platform promises to do on a full Windows 10 operating system no less.



So what does Gen 2 bring?

Mostly higher clock speeds which now enable even better capabilities out of the Qualcomm Hexagon 692 DSP Spectra 255 Image Signalling Processor (ISP) and Kyro 468 CPU. Almost all other features and offerings like its integrated Snapdragon X15 LTE modem enabling up to 600Mbps downlink dual-band Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 5.0 are on a par with the first-generation Snapdragon 7c. You might ask why not update the Wi-Fi to a newer standard or offer 5G connectivity but Qualcomm feels these features were omitted to keep to the target price range. Besides it won't be a necessity for most consumers hunting for a laptop in that mass-market price segment.

The Gen 2 part is likely made possible from a more matured silicon process allowing higher clocks or Qualcomm has been able to speed bin them better to offer another SKU or perhaps a combination of both reasons. In any case here's how they compare technically:-

Will Snapdragon Compute based systems gain more popularity?

While not yet popular the Windows-on-ARM platform emulating x86 code is partially to blame as they tend to run into compatibility issues; chiefly only Windows Store apps and popular 32-bit Windows applications run well without hitches. x64 applications aren’t supported on ARM processors but that might be changing as Windows x64 emulation has been introduced since late in 2020 in developer builds.

Actual usability is still a hit-or-miss at this stage and is a work-in-progress but Microsoft’s commitment to address running x64 apps (from their Windows Store or otherwise) remains a priority to sweeten the abilities of Windows-on-Snapdragon and as a result Windows-on-ARM ecosystem as a whole. When does run fine we've seen it offering very fulfilling experiences. To help accelerate testing and development for Windows on Snapdragon application testing Qualcomm will also be releasing an affordable test system for developers dubbed the Snapdragon Developer Kit for Windows.

Microsoft’s Windows 10 platform commitment and ongoing enhancements could be enough to edge more vendors to adopt and introduce a wider variety of Snapdragon Compute Platform based notebooks to democratize high-quality entry-level PC experiences.

At this point in time Lenovo is chimed in their support for the Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 Compute Platform process and we expect to see more details of their product line-up at Computex 2021 along with other possible design wins. Stay tuned for more reporting on this topic in the next few weeks.

One of my five predictions for retail supply chains in 2021 was an increased use of on-demand custom garment manufacturing. Not long ago this was seen as a luxury process only available to upscale customers willing to pay top dollar but that’s changing thanks to new manufacturing technologies changing customer preferences and sustainability expectations and mounting reverse logistics costs.

Footwear giants Nike Adidas and Vans (VF Corp.) have proven there’s a market for personalized custom-designed sneakers. I just made a pair of Nike Air Max 1s last week! Late last year Amazon launched “Made for You” a made-to-order customizable T-shirt service.

Plans like Amazon Made for You and Stitchfix fit the ethos of today’s shoppers – sustainability and less waste. There are significant benefits for the retailers as well including the ability to respond quickly to evolving fashion trends keep minimal stock on hand and discount less at season’s end.

Ralph Lauren is the latest brand to roll out on-demand manufacturing with the launch of The Made-to-Order Polo feature on its website last week. It’s a straightforward offering allowing customers to choose from six designs and 24 color combinations. Customers can create hundreds of designs by choosing the color or color block of the body sleeves and collar and customizing the sleeve with letters words or initials through a digitally integrated experience.

Why is Ralph Lauren doing this? In its announcement the company said this model has both immediate and long-term benefits including “reducing product inventory allowing for rapid fulfillment and agility in meeting consumer desires and taste eliminating the need for markdowns.”

For many years Ralph Lauren has offered personalization at many of its flagship stores including London’s Regent Street where customers can design their own version of the classic Polo shirt an Oxford shirt or a blazer in-store. Now with new manufacturing techniques like RL’s “flat-knit technology” and a desire for more DTC sales Lauren intends to recreate the rich customer experience of in-store personalization online.

Ralph Lauren posted Q4 and full-year 2020 results last week and they left something to be desired. While many of its peers are posting stellar uplifts as Americans both return to stores and return to buying clothing RL’s Q4 North American revenue was down 10% – off the back of an 11.2% decline in the prior year.

Final thoughts. Ralph Lauren is no stranger to excess inventory. Between 2013 and 2016 Lauren’s stock price plummeted nearly 50% as analysts harped on poor inventory management. At the time RL had an inventory lead time of 15 months which created three major problems. First the company was less able to react to changing consumer trends. Second holding inventory is not cheap. A final (and most important) consequence was frequent discounting of low-demand products and a shift toward outlet stores which not only reduced profit margins but also diluted the luxury brand image.

Management believes on-demand garment manufacturing is a viable option for RL to keep inventory lean compress lead times and reduce end-of-season markdowns while meeting changing consumer desires. I can’t argue with their logic but I will argue the price point may not attract the level of customers it needs to generate the scale necessary to make the unit economics work.

The primary reason mass customization isn’t widespread is simply the fact that it’s expensive.

This is why only premium brands have entered into the space until recently. To make it work brands either need volume to generate economies of scale or they need a lofty price to rationalize the cost. I’m afraid that Ralph Lauren with this offering won’t generate the scale needed to make the model work at this price and I’m wary of the price itself.

At $105 to $168 for a custom Polo shirt I feel Ralph Lauren may be negatively splitting the market. At that price Ralph Lauren won’t be attracting the value-conscious consumer. And for the premium buyers when they spend $150 on a designer shirt don’t you think they might want the designer’s shirt? I could be way off base here but most people I know willing to spend that on a shirt are buying the brand the quality and the design.





Will this work? No idea but I love that the company is experimenting.

Last spring the festival was one of Tampa’s last major concerts to throw in the towel due to the coronavirus pandemic. After two more postponements it was finally a go for this Memorial Day weekend with a lineup of top electronic dance music artists.

The first Sunset Music Festival was held in 2012.

The two-day show Saturday and Sunday with headliners such as AC Slater Destructo Lizzy Jane 12th Planet LSDream Rezz and Zomboy attracts fans who like to dance while clad in neon glitter and tie-dye.

The pandemic seemed a distant memory as people crowded around the festival’s four stages Saturday. Promoters said on social media that many types of tickets for the event were sold out and all others 99 percent gone.

Gates open 3 p.m. Sunday at the north lot of Raymond James Stadium.

Promoters are emphasizing safety in their messaging still mindful of calls to shut it down for good after two festival-goers died of accidental drug abuse in 2016. The psychotropic MDMA was found in their systems.

On Saturday Tampa police made eight arrests at the festival on felony narcotics charges police spokesman Eddy Durkin said. One suspect faces an additional charge of battery on a law enforcement officer.

Emergency medical personnel handled 87 calls at the festival and made 29 transports to local hospitals none of them for what appeared to be life-threatening issues Durkin.

Just before midnight Saturday a car struck a woman as she was crossing Himes Avenue west of the Raymond James property. The woman was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries and the driver cooperated with police.

The messaging this year also emphasizes the need to guard against heat and dehydration. Maps show festival-goers where to find multicolored shade stations cool-down zones and free water.

The forecast for Sunday from the National Weather Service: Scattered showers and thunderstorms mainly between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. Partly sunny with a high near 89. Calm wind becoming west southwest 5 to 7 mph in the afternoon. Chance of rain is 40 percent during the day 30 percent at night.

Paul Heyman hinted at Brock Lesnar's return to the ring during an interview on SportsTalk 790's A-Team w/ Wexler & Clanton radio show.

“Asking me about Brock Lesnar is a highly intelligent question and I commend you on your efforts” Heyman said (h/t Paul Davis of Wrestlingnews.co and Sai Mohan of Wrestling Inc.).

“However it’s a hypothetical. Brock Lesnar does what Brock Lesnar wants to do. If Brock Lesnar wanted to be back in WWE at this moment at this particular time and place he would be.

“Maybe maybe he has been waiting for the live events and maybe he’ll choose Houston to make that return...or maybe not because Brock Lesnar is going to do whatever Brock Lesnar wants to do.”

WWE is set to hit the road again on July 16 when SmackDown occurs in Houston's Toyota Center. That will kick off a 25-city tour which will also include a stop in Fort Worth Texas for Money in the Bank on July 18.

WWE hasn't been on tour since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic although WrestleMania 37 took part in front of fans at Tampa's Raymond James Stadium last April.

The 43-year-old Lesnar who was also the UFC heavyweight champion and won gold at the 2000 NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships hasn't been in the ring since losing his WWE Championship belt to Drew McIntyre at WrestleMania 36 in March 2020.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9qc29ubGluZS9uYW1lL3JheW1vbmQta2Fjem1hcmVrLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMzNjYzNzbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Raymond Kaczmarek Obituary (2020) - Menomonee Falls WI - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/jsonline/name/raymond-kaczmarek-obituary?id=3366376 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9qc29ubGluZS9uYW1lL3JheW1vbmQta2Fjem1hcmVrLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMzNjYzNzbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is probably one of Nvidia's worst-kept secrets in recent years and the continuing string of information leaves absolutely no doubt that it will contend for a spot on our list of Best Graphics Cards in the coming month or so.

LambaTek has listed prices starting at $2000 for custom 3080 TI models but there are caveats. The current consensus is that Nvidia could launch the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti with a $999 to $1099 MSRP to fill in the small gap left by the GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3090. Even if the price is accurate it's probably for the Founders Edition which means custom models will ultimately arrive with a steeper price tag. Furthemore the graphics card market isn't exactly in a good place right now so we doubt retailers will respect Nvidia's MSRP for the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti.

LambdaTek is a foreign shop and as we all know computer hardware is generally more expensive outside U.S. soil. Since we don't know if these are placeholder prices do take them with a bit of salt. For easier comprehension we've converted the pricing from pounds to dollars and factored out the 20% VAT (value-added tax) rate.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Pricing

Swipe to scroll horizontally Vendor Graphics Card Part Number Price MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Suprim X 12G V389-057R $2559 Gigabyte Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Master GV-N308TAORUS M-12GD $2559 Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Gaming OC GV-N308TGAMING OC-12GD $2432 Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Vision OC GV-N308TVISION OC-12GD $2303 Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Eagle OC GV-N308TEAGLE OC-12GD $2177 Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Eagle GV-N308TEAGLE-12GD $2177

The trend is that all the listed GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics cards cost over $2000 — almost twice the rumored $1099 MSRP. However we think LambdaTek's pricing might be accurate. If anything these prices look too conservative.

For instance a custom GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card starts at $2600 in the U.S. market. Therefore the Ti version which is faster will likely arrive with a significant retailer markup. Sadly that's the reality of the graphics card market right now. Stock is limited and whatever is in stock sells at ridiculous prices.

GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (Image credit: LambdaTek)

LambdaTek has the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Suprim X 12G up for $2559 which is the most expensive model out of the lot. That's believable because the Suprim X is MSI's flagship part and comes with all the bells and whistles.

Gigabyte's custom GeForce RTX 3080 Ti offerings span from $2177 to $2559. The Aorus GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Master is right up there with the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Suprim X 12G in terms of pricing. Specification-wise we don't know which one is faster. The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Eagle is evidently Gigabyte's cheapest SKU and even that costs a whopping $2177.

We have new photos of the upcoming RTX 3080 Ti models.

ZOTAC RTX 3080 Ti AMP Holo/Trinity

ZOTAC is launching AMP Holo and Trinity models based on GA102-225 GPU. The AMP series represents the flagship series from ZOTAC being only challenged by the ArcticStorm with the preinstalled water block. The company also offers custom models designed specifically for the Chinese market but those cards are not available worldwide.

The AMP Holo keeps the dual 8-pin power connectors from the RTX 3080 non-Ti model. Both cards look pretty much the same. The important changes are hidden under the triple-fan cooling solution though. This model comes with 10240 CUDA cores and 12GB GDDR6X memory both being an upgrade over the non-Ti series.

The Trinity model comes with a slightly different cooler it is obviously being targeted at a lower price point. This model specifically is the non-OC variant which means it offers a reference clock speed of 1665 MHz.

Colorful RTX 3080 Ti Advanced

A photo of the Colorful RTX 3080 Ti Advanced has also leaked. This model not-so-bad looking model represents the mid-tier in the Colorful lineup. The Advanced series should be outperformed by Vulcan Neptune and KUDAN series. The packaging does not reveal any details on the new SKU but the card appears to be using the same cooling solution as the RTX 3080 non-Ti. No major changes here.

Lenovo RTX 3080 Ti Legion

Desktop Planning Manager for Legion China has revealed the design of the RTX 3080 Ti model. Two graphics cards were photographed and published on Weibo social media platform. These cards are for pre-built Legion gaming PCs. These two cards are RTX 3080 and an unnamed RTX model which name was blurred out. It does not take a lot of effort to realize that the second card is 3080 Ti though. The only reason we know this is RTX 3080 Ti is that it will not feature an NVLInk connector for multi-GPU configuration. This feature is available to the RTX 3090 series.

This is actually the first board partner that we know of to be introducing major changes to the cooler for the Ti SKU. Both 3080 models are to feature the exact same reference board design thus most AIBs opted to reuse existing coolers. Apparently Lenovo decided to put a thicker 3-slot cooler on the new model which actually makes a lot of sense considering it has the same TDP as RTX 3090 (350W).

The launch of NVIDIA's latest Ampere graphics cards is right around the corner (tomorrow to be exact) which means that more information is leaking out about both the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti and the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti . The only logical price point for the former is $599 while the latter is likely to come in at $999.

However we all know that those prices are downright ""fictional"" given the ongoing global chip shortage and the sky-high demand for enthusiast graphics cards at the moment. Such is the case with the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti which has shown up for sale at UK retailer LambdaTek.

The retailer lists several Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics cards including the following:

Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Eagle: £1534

Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Eagle OC: £1534

Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Vision OC: £1623

Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Gaming OC: £1714

Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Aorus Master: £1803

The above-listed prices exclude Value Added Tax (VAT). Taking into account VAT all of those prices are roughly £300 more expensive. There's even a listing for an MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Suprim X priced at £1804.

Even if we look at the cheapest card the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Eagle the £1534 price converts to nearly $2200. Of course we can't take a straight currency conversion as gospel but it at least gives you a ballpark idea of where prices are heading straight out of the gate with the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti. The most expensive card the MSI GeForce RTX 308 Ti Suprim X is priced at roughly $2560.





We should keep in mind that these prices aren't too out of line with the pricing we've seen for the existing GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3090. A quick trip over to eBay shows the former selling (brand new sealed) for around $2200 to $2300 on average. The GeForce RTX 3090 on the other hand goes for $3000 to $3400.

This insane pricing even extends to lesser members of the Ampere family as we saw the new GeForce RTX 3060 LHR selling at the equivalent of $967 in South Korea versus an MSRP of around $329.

The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will launch this week with 10240 CUDA cores base/boost clocks of 1365MHz/1665MHz 12GB GDDR6X memory (384-bit bus) and performance that should come close to the flagship GeForce RTX 3090.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVsdHJhYm9va3Jldmlldy5jb20vNDcwNTYtYXN1cy10dWYtZGFzaC1mMTUtZng1MTZwZS1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Asus TUF Dash F15 FX516PE review (Intel i7 RTX 3050Ti Laptop 144 Hz screen),"Earlier this year Asus launched a controversial product the TUF Dash F15 series which is a slim and compact 15-inch laptop built on Intel H35 and Nvidia RTX 3000 hardware.

This series tries to make its way somewhere in between the regular Asus TUF Gaming and the portable Asus ROG Zephyrus G classes of products aiming to be a competitive everyday laptop with good gaming abilities and a portable form-factor. We’ve reviewed the top-tier Dash F15 configuration a few months ago and concluded that an RTX 3070 Laptop GPU is sometimes overpowered and bottlenecked by the 4C Intel i7-11370H processor that Asus puts on this series which makes that configuration a hard sell.

In the meantime though we’ve got our hands on a better-balanced configuration which pairs the same Intel i7-11370H processor with an RTX 3050Ti Laptop graphics chip in a notebook that’s available over here in stores from just around 1000 EUR. For that you are only getting 8 GB of RAM in single-channel (so you’ll absolutely need to add an extra stick) 512 GB of SSD storage and unfortunately the same kind of 144 Hz display that Asus offers on the 2020 and 2021 TUF Gaming lineup. But if the Tiger Lake H35 makes any sense these days that’s on this kind of a product and this kind of configuration.

Update: If interested our review of the updated 2022 Dash F15 FX517 series is available here. This offer better screens faster processors and graphics and a MUX.

Further down in this detailed review we’ll touch on all the important aspects that you should be aware of before buying this laptop in our quest to figure out if this is a good buy in its price-class or not.

Design and construction

We’ve already covered the design build and ergonomics of this Tuf Dash F15 series in my initial review and I’m not going to do it again since those aspects are identical between the available configurations.

In just a few words though this Dash F15 is a slim compact and lightweight 15-inch laptop built mostly out of plastic and with a metal lid. It’s available in either a White or Dark-Gray model and the entire thing feels nicely made and pleasant to use every day.

It’s also practical even if it lacks some of the features available on higher-tier products such as biometrics up-firing speakers a 180-degree screen or even a camera.

Keyboard and trackpad

The inputs on this series look to be borrowed from the 2020 Zephyrus G15 with a rather small plastic clickpad and a minimalist keyboard without a NumPad section.

Both are pretty good with daily use though as explained in the previous review and the keyboard proved to be a solid typer during my time with it. However it only lights up in teal and that’s not ideal as it makes the writing on these white keys difficult to see in certain conditions. The Dark-gray variant should not face this issue though.

Screen

The screen on the other hand is different on this lower-tier configuration than the one offered on the 3070 models.

Those came with a fair-quality 240 Hz Sharp panel with 100% sRGB color coverage and fast response times. This 3050Ti configuration on the other hand is mostly available with the Chi Mei 144 Hz panel with only 62% sRGB colors and slower response times. This translates into more washed-out and unrealistic colors as well as some ghosting in fast-paced games. In fact this is similar to the screen that Asus also put on their TUF Gaming lineup from 2020 and 2021 and you’ll find plenty of details about it if you do a quick Google/Youtube search.

I for one understand that this Dash F15 needs to cut some corners in order to meet its aggressive price tag but I just can’t recommend this panel in this day and age as for me the screen is probably one of the last things I would be willing to sacrifice on my laptop and a 100% sRGB panel with decent response would be an absolute minimum requirement on a gaming laptop that I would use.

Here’s what we got in our tests with an X-Rite i1 Display Pro sensor:

Panel HardwareID: Chi Mei CMN1521 (N156HRA-EA1);

Coverage: 62.6% sRGB 43.8% AdobeRGB 44.8% DCI-P3;

Measured gamma: 2.47;

Max brightness in the middle of the screen: 287.54 cd/m2 on power;

Min brightness in the middle of the screen: 16.11 cd/m2 on power;

Contrast at max brightness: 1407:1;

White point: 6600 K;

Black on max brightness: 0.20 cd/m2;

PWM: No.

Colors and response aside this panel checks most of the other boxes with good blacks contrast and uniformity as well as little light bleeding around the edges. Those colors though…

Hardware and performance

This test model is the more affordable configuration of the ASUS TUF Dash F15 code name FX516PE built on an Intel Core i7-11370H 4C/8T processor 16 GB of DDR4 3200 MHz memory in dual channel 1 TB of SSD storage and dual graphics: the Nvidia RTX 3050Ti Laptop dGPU with 4 GB of vRAM and the Iris Xe iGPU integrated within the Intel processor.

Before we proceed keep in mind that our review unit was sent over by Asus and is a retail model identical to the ones you can already get in stores running on the software available as of mid-May 2021 (BIOS 312 Armoury Crate 3.0.5.0 GeForce 466.47 drivers).

Spec-wise the TUF Dash F15 is built on an Intel H35 platform with Nvidia graphics. The i7-11370H is only a 4C/8T processor and despite its ability to run at high clock speeds when supplied with enough power (up to 60W on this laptop) we saw that it’s not always a good match for a higher-tier GPU such as the RTX 3070 as it ends-up bottlenecking the combined and gaming performance in some cases.

On this FX516PE we get to see how this same processor pairs with a mid-range GPU the RTX 3050Ti which runs at between 60-75W with Dynamic Boost 2.0. This GPU only gets 4 GB of vRAM which might not suffice for certain titles but it’s not meant for AAA gaming at maximum settings anyway but is rather a budget printed chip meant for laptops around 1000 USD/EUR.

For RAM and storage options the laptop comes with 8 GB of memory preinstalled and one extra accessible memory DIMM as well as two M.2 SSD slots. Our unit shipped with 16 GB of RAM in dual-channel and a fast Sk Hynix SSD. The SSD performance is solid without any throttling or hiccups.

Getting inside to the components is a fairly simple task you just have to pop up the back panel that’s held in place by a couple of Philips screws.

As far as the software goes Asus offers three power profiles for the TUF Dash F15 FX516PE:

Silent – idle/quiet fans and limited CPU/GPU speeds and power;

Performance – balanced profile with stock CPU/GPU settings averagely noise fans – GPU runs at 60-75W and stock clocks;

Turbo – High-Performance profile with increased CPU power allocation faster-spinning fans and overclocked GPU (up to 75W +100 MHz Core/+120 MHz Memory).

Turbo is only available with the laptop plugged in and meant for gaming and other demanding loads. Performance is a jack-of-all-trades while Silent is made for video and daily light use. The fans switch off on the Silent profile as long and the CPU/GPU stay under 60 degrees C leading to a quiet daily-use experience. Here’s what to expect in terms of performance and temperatures with everyday multitasking browsing and video.

On to more demanding loads we start by testing the CPU’s performance by running the Cinebench R15 test for 15+ times in a loop with 1-2 seconds delay between each run.

The Intel i7 processor runs at 50+ W of sustained power on the Turbo setting which translates in constant frequencies of 4.3 GHz and scores of 1050-1100 points. The temperatures average in the high 80s but fluctuate alongside the fans which alternate between long periods of little activity and shorter periods when they ramp up to 45 dB. We’re not seeing any performance degradation on any sort of throttling for the entire duration of the test.

Switching over to the Performance profile translates in the CPU stabilizing at around 45-50W and similar temperatures and fan behavior. The scores drop by 2-5% compared to the Turbo profile.

On Silent the processor runs at 18-25W with barely audible fans (sub 35 dB) and middling temperatures (low to high-60s C). It returns scores of around 800 points roughly 25% lower than those registered on the Turbo profile.

Finally the CPU constantly runs at ~35 W of power on battery on the Performance profile with temperatures in the mid-70s and scores of 900+ points. Details below.

To put these findings in perspective the i7-11370H is no match for the Core H/ Ryzen H processors of this generation with the limited amount of cores. It does run ~20% faster than the standard Tiger Lake Core U i7 in this test but at nearly twice the sustained power.

Of course this is just a multi-threaded CPU benchmark and there’s more to consider when looking at this processor as you’ll see in a bit.

We then went ahead and further verified our findings with the longer Cinebench R23 loop test and the gruesome Prime 95 on the Turbo profile. The CPU stabilizes at ~57 W on Turbo in both Cinebench R23 and Prime 95 with sustained temperatures in the ~90s Celsius and the fans spinning at 44-45 dB.

We also ran our combined CPU+GPU stress tests on this notebook. 3DMark stress runs the same test for 20 times in a loop and looks for performance variation and degradation over time and this unit passed it just fine. This is a good indicator of solid combined performance with an emphasis on the GPU such as in games.

Next we ran the entire suite of tests and benchmarks on the stock Turbo profile in Armoury Crate.

This Tiger Lake H35 i7 scores excellently in the single-core tests outmatching the ultrabook-class Tiger Lakes and any of the previous generation Intel or AMD products. However AMD Ryzen 5000 CPUs match these results and even come on top in some tests. In multi-threaded tests of course the results are on par with the 4C/8T architecture and not a match for any of the modern processors with 6 or 8 Cores.

This article compares the Core i7-11370H to the Ryzen 7 5800H platforms and is a good place to start understanding the differences between them.

We also ran some tests on the Performance profile of this TUF Dash F15 mostly in order to compare the scores between the default and the overclocked version of the 3050Ti GPU.

We’re looking at roughly 5-10% lower GPU scores on this non-overclocked profile and fairly similar CPU scores.

As for more details on how the 3050Ti compares to 3060 and 3070 chips at fairly similar power I’d suggest going through this article.

With these out of the way let’s look at some games. We ran a couple of DX11 DX12 and Vulkan titles on the stock Turbo Performance and Silent profiles on both FHD (internal screen) and FHD/QHD (external monitor) resolutions. Whisper Mode is enabled on the Silent profile. Here’s what we got:

This 3050Ti configuration can handle older and casual titles at maximum details but you’ll have to trim those graphics settings towards medium in the modern AAA games. RT is also a tough job for this chip in most titles so you’d be better off with one of the higher-tier RTX 3000 GPUs for that.

The HWinfo logs below show the CPU and GPU speeds and temperatures in Far Cry 5 Cyberpunk 2077 or Battlefield V on the stock Turbo profile.

While there are some differences between these titles on average the RTX 3050Ti GPU in this Dash F15 runs at 60-75W on this mode with temperatures in the 75-78 degrees Celsius while the CPU runs at between 20-35W with temperatures in the 70-85 degrees Celsius. The fans ramp up to about 44-45 dB which is averagely loud and quieter than on the 3070 configuration. That was expected since the 3050Ti is a lower-power chip.

Slightly lifting up the laptop from the desk in order to improve the air intake underneath into the fans helps shed about 1-3 degrees of both the CPU and GPU so not something you should bother with on this series.

Switching over to the Performance profile slightly limits the CPU’s power and GPU’s clocks and allows the fans to spin a little quieter (42-43 dB) with a small toll on real-life performance lower CPU temperatures but slightly higher GPU temperatures around 80 degrees C. Unlike on many of the other ASUS ultraportable gaming laptops the Performance profile is actually usable here.

Quiet sub-40 dB gaming is also somewhat possible here on the Silent profile. We’ve tested with Whisper Mode on which sets a hard limit of 60 fps in most titles paired with a power-capped CPU and the GPU capped at .78 GHz and roughly 30W of power. These settings are not enough for 60 fps with Ultra settings in most of the tested titles so the Silent profile doesn’t make as much sense on this 3050Ti model as on the higher-tier configurations unless you’re willing to trim the details.

Finally here’s what happens when you hook up the laptop to an external screen (via DP to counteract the effect of not having a MUX switch). We’re looking at solid performance and temperatures both with the laptop sitting on a desk and especially if you close the lid and place this Dash F15 in a vertical stand which further facilitates the airflow of fresh air into the fans and leads to excellent CPU and GPU temperatures. At the same time the results show that the 3050Ti Laptop GPU is designed for FHD gaming and not powerful enough for QHD.

All in all this 3050Ti GPU makes a lot more sense on a Tiger Lake H35 configuration than the 3060/3070 variants. Sure you’re not getting the same kind of performance here (I’ve added a comparison with a 60+W 3060 – Zephyrus G14 and 80+W 3070 – Dash F15 in order for you to tell the differences) but you also don’t have to deal with any bottlenecks caused by the 4C/8T processor you get a cooler/quieter product and a more affordable price.

Noise Heat Connectivity speakers and others

The Dash F15 is nearly identical on the inside to the 2020 Zephyrus M15 and gets nearly the same thermal module with only minor differences in the VRM heatpipes. It’s also important to add that the thermal design is identical between the 3070 3060 and 3050Ti configurations and that benefits the lower-power 3050Ti in terms of temperatures and noise levels.

Paired with the open-back design the plastic chassis (less of a thermal conductor than the metallic designs) and the overall lower-power hardware inside there’s no surprise this doesn’t heat up badly with games and demanding loads. With games we’re looking at internal CPU temperatures of around 70-85 degrees C (with few exceptions) and 75-78 C on the GPU paired with slightly quieter fans than on the 3070 configurations tested in the past (~44 dB vs ~47 dB on the 3070 version).

External temperatures fall within comfortable limits with games and demanding loads as well with the WASD and arrows regions averaging in the high-30s to mid-40s and certain spots in the middle of the laptop around the CPU/GPU still go up to mid-50s on the top and mid-60s on the bottom on top pf the heatpipes.

With lighter use this laptop is a breeze running cooly and quiet on the Silent profile since both fans switch off as long as the CPU/GPU don’t go above 60 C. I also haven’t noticed any coil whining on my sample yet there’s no guarantee you won’t run into electronic noises on your unit so make sure to carefully listen for any irregularities within your return window. For what is worth the fans remain active on Performance/Turbo even with the laptop sitting idle.

*Daily Use – streaming Netflix in EDGE for 30 minutes Silent profile fans at 0 dB

*Gaming – Performance – playing Far Cry 5 for 30 minutes fans at 42-43 dB

*Gaming – Turbo on desk – playing Far Cry 5 for 30 minutes fans at 44-45 dB



For connectivity there’s Wireless 6 and Bluetooth 5 through an Intel AX201 chip on this unit as well as Gigabit Lan. Our sample performed well on WiFi both near the router and at 30+ feet with obstacles in between.

The speakers have been carried over from the 2020 Zephyrus lineups which means they’re fairly punchy at 80+ dB at head-level and about average in terms of quality. Not bad not amazing. Headphone audio is pretty good as well.

As for the camera there’s isn’t any on this laptop just like on the Zephyrus models. There’s a pair of microphones at the bottom of the screen though.

Battery life

There’s a 76Wh battery inside the TUF Dash F15 series again carried over from the Zephyrus series.

Here’s what we got on our review unit in terms of battery life with the screen’s brightness set at around 120 nits (~60 brightness).

12.5 W (~5-6 h of use) – text editing in Google Drive Silent Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON;

– text editing in Google Drive Silent Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON; 11 W (~7 h of use) – 1080p fullscreen video on Youtube in Edge Silent Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON;

– 1080p fullscreen video on Youtube in Edge Silent Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON; 10.5 W (~7-8 h of use) – Netflix fullscreen in Edge Silent Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON;

– Netflix fullscreen in Edge Silent Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON; 14 W (~4-5 h of use) – browsing in Edge Performance Mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON.

The streaming and low-use results are worse than what we got on the previous Dash F15 configuration tested a few months ago and I’m not sure what caused the decrease in runtimes. The system still automatically switches the screen to 60Hz while on battery and on the iGPU. There’s also an iGPU/dGPU toggle in Armoury Crate that you can use to completely shut off the Nvidia card while unplugged making sure no rogue program running in the background would wake it up and eat into your battery life.

Asus pairs the laptop with a compact 180W power-brick in this variant slightly smaller and lighter than the 200W brick on the 3070 model. The battery fills up in about 2 hours and USB-C charging up to 100W is also possible here just in case you don’t want to carry along the main brick with you when traveling.

Price and availability

The 2021 TUF Dash F15 series is listed in most parts of the world at the time of this article in all sorts of configurations.

As mentioned several times throughout this article this Dash F15 FX516PE 3050Ti variant tested here makes the most sense on this chassis and that’s available from 1000 EUR over here in Europe (with 8 GB of RAM – single channel and 512 GB SSD) or 1100 EUR for 16 GB of RAM in dual-channel and a 1 TB SSD.

Unfortunately all of these are paired with the 144 Hz Chi Mei panel with the washed-out 60% sRGB colors and fairly poor response times and that could be a deal-breaker for some of you. I sure wish Asus didn’t skimp on this aspect and put a better 144 Hz panel on this product the kinds that are available out there on mid-priced products.

At the time of this article the only other panel available for the Dash F15 series is the 240 Hz Sharp panel but that’s an exclusive option on the 3070 configurations.

Final thoughts

This TUF Dash F15 series is the most affordable ultraportable 15-inch product that Asus have in stores with this 2021 generation and as I mentioned in my earlier review of the RTX 3070 configuration it checks many of the right boxes and even surpasses my expectations at some levels.

The lightweight and slim format and the overall balanced configuration are the main selling points of this series. Furthermore this Dash F15 also delivers a snappy everyday experience paired with good runtimes and some fair FHD gaming abilities with solid thermals and quiet fans.

On the other hand the Tiger Lake H35 hardware platform might not suffice for your needs especially if you plan on running workloads that could benefit from a 6C or 8C processor and it’s important to account for this aspect when deciding for or against this product.

For me the 11370H is a fair match for a 3050Ti configuration and not a reason to look past this product but if multi-threaded performance is important for you you’d be better off with something like the full-size AMD-based TUF A15 series instead or maybe the Legion 5 or Omen 15 alternatives. Furthermore the portable 2021 Zephyrus G14 is also a very competitive option around the 1200 EUR price tag (for the 3050Ti version) an even smaller and lighter product with a superior quality 144 Hz display and the more powerful AMD Ryzen 5000 hardware.

Back to our Dash F15 the 144 Hz panel with 60% sRGB colors and slow response times that Asus put on most configurations is my biggest nit with this series and a potential deal-breaker. Everything else I’m OK with and I understand that Asus had to cut some corners in order to get this at around ~1000 EUR but those 60% colors are just hard for me to accept. In all fairness I’ve been spoiled by all these nicer screens that I get to use every day so I might be a little biased against this screen but I still don’t think OEMs should compromise with this sort of panel in this day and age. Asus already offer a nicer display on this series but only on the more expensive and unbalanced 3070 variants and I’d gladly pay a little extra in order to get the same screen on the 3050/3060 models as well.

Update: If interested our review of the updated 2022 Dash F15 FX517 series is available here. This offer better screens faster processors and graphics and a MUX.

Anyway we’ll wrap up this 2021 TUF Dash F15 review here but I’d love to hear what you think about it and whether you think this is worth buying or not. Let’s discuss it down below.

Spy Makers is a conversation series where we sit down with inventors designers and entrepreneurs to talk about their work. In this story SPY Contributor Loren Cecil talks to Darryl and Jessica Sharpton about their new direct-to-consumer furniture company Albany Park.

Today's Top Deals

Buying furniture online can be incredibly overwhelming. The options are endless and so many options look almost exactly the same. Once you finally make a choice you’re still taking a gamble as to how long it’ll take to be delivered and whether it’ll even fit through your front door. Albany Park wants to change that.

Darryl Sharpton was running a furniture showroom out of his college apartment when he realized that people were comfortable buying things sight unseen if he could handle the delivery. After five years as a linebacker in the NFL he and his wife Jessica saw an opportunity to use what Darryl had learned through this undergraduate experiment and start selling wholesale furniture through platforms like Amazon and Wayfair. This allowed them to gather intel from customers that they would later use to launch Albany Park.

The husband and wife team has a simple yet ambitious goal for their young company: they want to make Albany Park the easiest place to buy furniture online.

“People are so brutal on there” Jessica said of the comments and reviews they received via selling through platforms like Amazon and Wayfair. “They’ll tell you everything about your product that was not absolutely perfect and so we used that as a great learning experience. We took all that feedback and put that into Albany Park.”

The Sharptons officially launched Albany Park at the end of 2019 after two years of selling wholesale on other sites. They believe that the simplicity of their brand is what sets them apart from other direct-to-consumer furniture companies. So far they only carry three collections with essential pieces for any living space. They want every piece of furniture they sell to be stylish comfortable and high quality.

In addition to eliminating decision fatigue Albany Park also takes the guesswork out of the delivery process. All of their furniture breaks down into pieces that are shipped in boxes through UPS rather than freight carriers so you won’t be required to stay put for an eight-hour delivery window only to have your new couch not show up at all or get stuck in your narrow stairwell.

For Memorial Day Weekend a lot of Albany Park furniture is marked down by 15% so this is the perfect time to discover this new furniture brand. If that hasn’t convinced you to check out Albany Park then keep reading. Darryl and Jessica shared some of their favorite Albany Park furniture to help make your decision even easier.

1. Park Armchair

BEST CHAIR

“We just released the Park Armchair in a new fabric called bouclé” Jessica said of her current favorite Albany Park piece though that changes daily. “It’s so pretty and it’s such a comfortable chair because it’s so oversized. It’s just a great product.”

2. Kova Sofa

BEST COUCH

While the Sharptons have pieces from all three collections in their house the Kova Sofa is everybody’s favorite seat at the moment. “Right now I’m really big on the Kova just because the velvet that we use is super high quality and soft and the cushions are super cozy” said Darryl. He’s particularly in love with the Rust Velvet fabric.

3. Ekaabo Albany Ottoman

BEST STATEMENT PIECE

If you’re all set on your larger furniture pieces but are looking for something to add a bit more flair to your living space this colorful Ekaabo Albany Ottoman makes a very fun and comfortable statement. (Okay so it’s technically spelled Ẹkáàbọ̀.) It can create an extra seat or just serve as a place to put your feet up while also elevating any room. The pattern was inspired by Darryl’s discovery of his West African heritage.

Expectations of U.S. monetary policy easing along with a much better-than-expected earnings season put the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite on track for their third consecutive week of gains. While most Fed policymakers have reiterated that the next policy move will be a rate cut doubt still remains about when the easing will begin.

The council last week endorsed a curbside recycling program but still has to approve an ordinance implementing it and a contract with the hauler to collect recyclables.

That would be a move away from the use of the city's central collection site at the corner of Columbia Avenue and Railway Street which has been designated for an affordable housing project. City officials have been exploring whether to relocate the recycling center or transition to a curbside pickup program.

""I'm pretty … excited to have a curbside recycling program in town"" council member Steve Qunell said. ""If we're going to spend money on this we should be doing it the right way. We know the issues at the central site we have now [with garbage left at the site] and the curbside program is the best way to capture more recycling anyway.""

The council examined options during several meetings and held a public hearing last week on the proposed recycling program. Public Works Director Craig Workman noted a single-stream residential curbside recycling program is one of the strategies outlined in the city's Climate Action Plan.

""Diverting more waste from the landfill is one of the most direct strategies Whitefish can pursue to reduce the environmental impacts of the city's consumption"" Workman said. ""Implementing a committed and thoughtful single-stream curbside recycling program can have a substantial positive impact on community waste diversion reduce contamination issues associated with multistream recycling and support community participation.""

Developing a new recycling site was estimated to cost about $183000 and management of the site through a contractor was expected to cost about $100000 annually. The cost of the site would have been passed onto all taxpayers in the city; a home valued at $400000 would have paid $37 for the first year of the central site and then about $15 per year afterward.

Asking about $262500 per year Republic Services was the lowest bidder for the proposed curbside recycling program with about 3500 residential customers. For each pickup stop the yearly cost is estimated to be about $75 and the charge for service will be mandatory for residences in the city regardless of use which is similar to the city's current garbage service.

Workman said the proposed program is structured with a user fee because individual service is provided to each residence.

DURING THE public hearing Kate McMahon who serves on the city's Climate Action Plan Standing Committee said recycling is the biggest issue the group has discussed.

""I want to commend the city for taking on the recycling issue"" she said. ""This is a big issue in the community.""

The program is set to accept flattened cardboard and paperboard; aluminum tin and steel cans; and newspaper magazines office paper catalogs and junk mail.

Mayre Flowers with Citizens for a Better Flathead asked that plastic be removed from the list of recyclable materials due to concerns that plastic collected around the world isn't actually recycled.

""We have tried to do some exhaustive research and can't find any firm that can commit that plastic gets recycled in the U.S."" Flowers told the council. ""Most of the plastic gets shipped overseas and most of that plastic ends up in oceans or villages and adds to pollution.""

Chuck Stearns said many people might throw plastic in their recycling bins anyway.

""I support the curbside program but if you go with single-stream but don't include plastic then you'll have a lot of contamination because people will put plastic in there"" he said.

Republic Services' Chad Bauer said only No. 1 and No. 2 plastics are accepted because that's what can be recycled.

""Everything we're looking at in this program is a commodity that has value somewhere in the U.S."" Bauer said. ""None of the materials are recycled in Montana; they all get shipped elsewhere. But everything we take gets recycled predominantly in the U.S. but some of the materials may be going elsewhere because it's about supply and demand and if the mills are full in the U.S. it gets shipped elsewhere. We will guarantee everything that we take gets taken to a recyclable facility.""

As part of getting the program up and running Bauer said the company plans an education campaign that would explain how to properly recycle and what should be placed in the bins. A bin found to be contaminated with the wrong materials would also be kept separate from the rest of the recyclable materials when pickup occurs so as not to contaminate an entire truckload.

""Our drivers look for contamination and then tag those bins showing why it couldn't be recycled and educating the customer"" he said. ""At that point in time the city will be notified and for the first one to two times this is free of charge. And then at some point there will be a charge because there needs to be a penalty for not recycling properly.""

FOR NOW at least the city's recycling program would only provide pickup at homes. Businesses have to contract directly with Republic Services or another contractor for recycling services.

Workman said the city and its contractor need to determine how collection will operate for multifamily residential buildings such as townhomes and apartments including determining where containers will be placed for those properties.

Single-family homes with alley collection likely will get new 96-gallon rollout carts for recyclables.

While some have raised concerns about recyclable containers becoming a bear attractant Republic Services said that properly disposed recycling should be free of food residue and thus not pose an issue.

Council member Rebecca Norton asked city staff to look into adding glass recycling and food composting to the program in the future.

The humanitarian consequences for people suffering the crisis in Syria are wide-ranging and profound. Overall 11.06 million people are in need of some form of humanitarian assistance in 2020. This includes 4.65 million people estimated to be in acute need.1 As the crisis enters its tenth year 6.1 million people remain internally displaced.2 5.6 million people have fled their homes the vast majority to neighbouring countries with limited prospects for return due to ongoing hostilities in some locations concerns regarding safety and the lack of adequate housing basic services and employment opportunities.3 In 2019 over 1.8 million population movements inside Syria were reported.4 Crucial civilian infrastructure such as schools water supply systems health facilities and housing infrastructure has sustained extensive damage and much of it remains unrestored or in disrepair. In areas where hostilities have subsided life remains a daily struggle due to limited access to basic services and livelihood opportunities increasing financial hardship and an eroding capacity to cope. Around ninety per cent of the population is estimated to live under the poverty line.5 Recent economic shocks stand to further set back the recovery of the Syrian people and render many more vulnerable. Millions of women children and men continue to rely on humanitarian assistance as a vital life-line and to meet their basic needs.

Humanitarian Consequences related to Physical and Mental Wellbeing People in Syria continue to suffer from increasingly localized intensified hostilities which uproot families from their homes claim civilian lives damage and destroy basic infrastructure and limit freedom of movement. Almost 40 per cent of internally displaced families have been displaced more than three times with every displacement further eroding coping capacity. Repeat displacement numbers are particularly high for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in north-west and north east Syria where the majority of the 1.8 million displacement movements were recorded in 2019.6 More than 400000 people were displaced in the north-west between May and August 2019 many of these multiple times. Some of those displaced were again uprooted a few months later forming part of the over 950000 people who fled escalating hostilities in southern Idleb and moved mostly northwards the Turkish-Syrian border during the period 1 December 2019 and 29 February 2020.7 In the north-east more than 250000 people were forced to flee their home during a two-week period in October 2019 with over 75000 people remaining displaced after that two-week period.

An additional 15750 Syrians sought shelter and international protection in Iraq.8

Many of those displaced sought refuge in and added to an already high number of IDPs living in last resort sites i.e. mainly informal settlements and collective centres in which shelter and WASH facilities are sub-standard and health and protection risks are elevated. In total the number of IDPs in last resort sites and camps increased by 42 per cent in 2019 compared to 2018 and as of February 2020 stands at over 1.4 million.9

Based on available data as many as 11.5 million people live in areas contaminated by explosive hazards exposing them to significant risks.10 57 per cent of those who have survived contact with explosive hazards in 2019 have sustained lifelong impairment.11 3.07 million are estimated to be living with a disability.12 The crisis continues to impact the mental wellbeing of those affected by new and prolonged displacement exposure to violence loss of income and reduced access to basic services touching the youngest in particular: 42 per cent of surveyed households report signs of psychosocial distress in children – nightmares lasting sadness and anxiety amongst others – in the last 30 days suggesting that many girls and boys are in a situation of prolonged distress.13 Half a million children are chronically malnourished and an additional 137000 children under five years of age are suffering from acute malnutrition heightening their exposure to preventable morbidity and mortality.14 Maternal malnutrition rates have increased five-fold compared to 2019 particularly in north-west Syria where acute malnutrition was prevalent in 21 per cent of displaced pregnant and breastfeeding women at the time of publication.15 Anemia is also on the rise. One out of every three pregnant and lactating women is anemic leading to poor intrauterine growth high-risk pregnancies and childbirth complications. One out of every four children 6-59 months are anemic and the youngest are most affected with 42 per cent of children 6-23 months suffering from anemia.16 In 2020 the number of food insecure people has increased by 22 per cent from 6.5 million in 2019 to 7.9 million people in 2020.17 Humanitarian Consequences related to Protection Multiple grave and often inter-connected protection risks persist. These include actions leading to civilian casualties (death and injuries) which point to violations of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) specifically a disregard for the principles of proportionality distinction and precaution. Attacks on civilian infrastructure such as health water supply and education facilities and personnel continue unabated and reduce population’s access to critical services. In 2019 85 attacks on healthcare facilities18 and personnel and 157 attacks on schools19 were recorded.

An estimated 2.45 million children aged five to seventeen are out of school20 and face elevated protection risks related to among others child marriage and engagement in child labour including in its worst forms such as recruitment and use by parties to the conflict.21 One in three school children are displaced with the physical and mental impact of displacement affecting individual growth and learning. In 2019 23 per cent of victims of explosive hazards accidents were children of whom 42 per cent were injured or killed while playing.22 Missing or absent civilian documentation frequently represents a barrier to exercising housing land and property rights and freedom of movement and is referenced by affected populations as the top concern for accessing assistance and services.

Insecure shelter/housing tenure due to the loss or lack of civil documentation generates additional physical and mental consequences for communities often leaving them with little choice but to reside in unsafe sub-standard buildings prone to collapse or in other sites of last resort. Fueled also by increasing economic hardship and a dramatic loss of purchasing power due to the devaluation of the Syrian pound affected population have little choice but to increasingly resort to harmful coping mechanisms many of which disproportionately affect women and girls including child / forced marriage and various forms of gender-based violence.

Meanwhile 95 per cent of the 438000 Palestinian refugees in Syria continue to be disproportionally affected by the above factors and will continue to experience extreme vulnerability in 2020.

Humanitarian Consequences related to Living Standards Years of crisis have exacerbated living conditions for most Syrians due to significant reductions in the availability of and access to essential services destructions of housing infrastructure loss of livelihoods and reduced purchasing power as a result of economic decline. Amongst others only 53 per cent of hospitals and 51 per cent of primary healthcare centres (PHCs) across Syria are estimated to be fully functional.23 Over eight million people have to rely on alternative and often unsafe water sources to meet or complement their water needs increasing public health risk with indicators on water availabity and quality being worst for IDPs in north-west and north-east Syria.24 The number of people requiring shelter assistance has increased by 20 per cent from 4.7 million in 2019 to over 5.5 million in 2020. This rise is driven by loss of capital the destruction of housing infrastructure and the deterioriation of shelter conditions in 238 out of 272 sub-districts and compounded by the scale of new displacement in 2019 protracted displacement return movements and a very limited shelter response.25 Over half of all IDPs have now been displaced for over five years26 many requiring sustained basic service delivery and livelihood support. A deteriorating economic situation caused chiefly by the protracted crisis and hostility-induced loss of economic assets underinvestment pressure resulting from unilateral coercive measures and exacerbated by the fiscal crisis in neighbouring Lebanon has contributed to the continued loss of livelihoods and reduction in household purchasing power.27 The ongoing devaluation of the Syrian Pound (SYP) which since October 2019 has lost over half of its value on the informal market and reached a low of 1250 SYP per US dollar (US$) in January 2020 has further reduced families’ purchasing power. These factors combined have contributed amongst others to the increase in the number of food insecure people and are likely to lead to further increases in poverty inflation and price levels for basic food and non-food items in 2020.28",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlcHVibGljd29ybGQuY29tL3RlY2gvZ2FkZ2V0cy9ub3RpZmljYXRpb24tc2VydmljZS1ub3QtcnVubmluZy1vbi1maXRiaXQtaGVyZXMtaG93LXRvLXJlc29sdmUtdGhpcy1pc3N1ZS_SAXZodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXB1YmxpY3dvcmxkLmNvbS90ZWNoL2dhZGdldHMvbm90aWZpY2F0aW9uLXNlcnZpY2Utbm90LXJ1bm5pbmctb24tZml0Yml0LWhlcmVzLWhvdy10by1yZXNvbHZlLXRoaXMtaXNzdWUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Notification Service not running on Fitbit: Here's how to resolve this issue,"Advertisement

Notwithstanding changes in technology that make the environment more dangerous for carriers it is very likely that France will construct at least one replacement carrier thus maintaining her naval aviation tradition for another half-century.

France’s first carrier entered service in the interwar period but for a very long time the French navy trailed behind international counterparts in naval aviation. This changed in the Cold War however and today France operates the world’s most advanced carrier outside of the U.S. Navy. How did France build its naval aviation force what does it do today and what direction will France take next?

The History of French Carriers

Soon after World War I France joined the international carrier community through the conversion of the battleship hulk Bearn. Although large Bearn did not carry many aircraft and never actively participated in combat even during World War II. The construction of two additional large carriers was suspended by World War II but after the war the French navy gained access to light carriers transferred from Britain and the United States.

This first appeared earlier and is being reposted due to reader interest.

Four in total these carriers helped the French navy develop its naval aviation muscles. The next step was big; France constructed a pair of CATOBAR aircraft carriers Clemenceau and Foch. Commissioned in 1961 and 1963 the ships displaced 30000 tons and could carry around forty modern aircraft. A third carrier the much larger Verdun was cancelled before being laid down. Clemenceau and Foch operating the F-8 Crusader and later the Super Etendard would form the backbone of the world’s second largest carrier force for the latter half of the Cold War. After nearly forty years of hard service the two ships were decommissioned in favor of France’s next carrier the nuclear-powered Charles de Gaulle.

The Current State of French Naval Aviation

Charles de Gaulle (CdG) entered service in May 2001 after a troubled fifteen-year construction period. Displacing 42000 tons Charles de Gaulle can make twenty-seven knots and operates up to forty aircraft. She is the only carrier in the world outside of the U.S. Navy to use catapults to launch aircraft and consequently carries conventional CATOBAR-capable jets such as the Dassault Rafale and the E-2C Hawkeye. CdG is also the only nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to serve outside the U.S. Navy.

France also has a trio of assault carriers the Mistral-class ships Mistral Tonnerre and Dixmude. At 20000 tons the Mistrals can carry around thirty helicopters of various types. During operations off Libya the Mistrals were pushed into a strike role serving as platforms for attack helicopters conducting attacks against Libyan government positions.

Strategic Rationale

France’s carriers have contributed in a variety of ways to France’s strategic security vision. From the beginning the French navy appreciated that its carriers might play a role in high intensity combat against the Soviets and accordingly the carriers prepared for that mission. Clemenceau and Foch were equipped for nuclear deterrence as is Charles de Gaulle. But France also regarded itself as having responsibilities to its (soon to be former) empire and French carriers served in the Indochina War as well as the Suez Incident.

French carriers have made their greatest contribution over the past two decades in support of multilateral military operations. Clemenceau and Foch both participated in various operations in support of UN missions in Israel; Clemenceau supported coalition operations in the 1991 Gulf War while Foch operated in the Adriatic in support of UN and NATO ops in the former Yugoslavia. Charles de Gaulle has conducted repeated operations off Afghanistan since 2001 often filling in for U.S. carriers called to other duties. She served off Libya in 2011 and has conducted airstrikes against ISIS in Syria since 2015.

The Future for French Carriers

France cancelled a second carrier based on the design of the British Queen Elizabeth–class ships in 2013. France and the United Kingdom differed over propulsion and the French are unlikely in any case to have settled for a ski-jump carrier. However the cancellation of the second ship violates a cardinal rule of carrier acquisition as France is effectively without a significant proportion of its naval power every time CDG enters refit. Indeed at the moment the carrier has been in refit since February 2017.

Charles de Gaulle is expected to serve until 2040 and the French government has authorized studies on the construction of a replacement which could potentially overlap with CdG’s final years in service. Any future ship or ships would likely retain nuclear propulsion adopt the EMALS catapult system and operate conventional CATOBAR aircraft. Would France build two? The United Kingdom has done it and the French navy has often chafed at the capability hit it endures with Charles De Gaulle enters refit. But much depends on France’s financial and security situation in the late 2020s and early 2030s and these factors are extremely hard to predict. It is also unclear what sort of aircraft the next generation of French carriers will fly. By 2040 the Dassault Rafale will be quite old and the future of France’s “sixth generation” fighter project remains murky.

Conclusion

France’s experience with CdG demonstrates that for a country in France’s position one aircraft carrier can be made to work. Almost all of the significant military activities undertaken by France since 2001 (and indeed before) have come in the context of a multilateral cooperative effort with other major countries. This has meant that CdG can contribute and contribute effectively but that her periods of refit do not come at the expense of the coalition’s overall military power. Indeed even the Mistrals helped fill in during the Libya campaign taking up the slack left by CdG’s refit.

In any case it is unlikely that the French government will want to go without a naval aviation capability as CdG nears retirement. Charles de Gaulle has served effectively in keeping France a viable even necessary presence in the Western multilateral intervention scene. Notwithstanding changes in technology that make the environment more dangerous for carriers it is very likely that France will construct at least one replacement carrier thus maintaining her naval aviation tradition for another half-century.

These technologies can automate:

Formulation (the mixture of ingredients which do not chemically react)

Extrusion (forcing soft ingredients through a shape to create the desired figure)

Batching

Drying

Coating

Liquid delivery processes (using hot or cold liquids to assist in transportation)

This technology results in consistent product quality a reduction on waste and cost-effective processing.

Furthermore due to the COVID-19 pandemic starting in a meat market businesses dealing in animal meat are keen to show their top hygiene standards and operational efficiency. Automation technology is popular as this equipment can be cleaned and sanitised more reliably than human workers.

Automation technology across the pet food sector

Other pet food companies have implemented similar technologies to boost performance.

Champion Petfoods a Canadian pet food company with a revenue of $108m uses video monitoring in its production line with hardware and software systems connected to the cooking processes. The company also uses:

Bulk bins and conveying systems

Rotator heat exchangers

Advanced extrusion and drying systems

A similar pet food manufacturing plant United Pet Group has utilised software from Rockwell Automation. This has:

Reduced overtime by 10%

Increased labour efficiency by 15%

New technology will help the pet food sector expand to meet demand

Owing to the isolation of the pandemic many families and individuals brought pets to keep them entertained or from feeling lonely. This has also led to a spike in dog thefts.

Market recovery and growth

In 2020 the global animal and pet food market stood at $305b and it is expected to grow to $318b by the end of 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.1%. At this rate the market is expected to reach $406b in 2025 at a CAGR of 6%.

This growth is mainly due to companies rearranging their operations and recovering from the COVID-19 impact which had earlier led to restrictive containment measures involving social distancing remote working and the closure of commercial activities that resulted in operational challenges.

If another pandemic should take place the implementation of automated technology in the animal and pet food market will mean businesses can proceed as per usual.

Joining the ranks of discount shops like TJ Maxx and Marshalls Ross is a great place for shoppers hunting for a bargain. Their slogan ""Dress for Less"" signifies their basic concepts: dress your whole family from clothes to shoes to accessories for less than you can find elsewhere.

According to Ross they are able to offer items at a low cost due to their large size — they are said to be the largest off-price retail chain in the United States. They also work directly with manufacturers and work on a ""no frills"" basis meaning they don't spend money on displays or decorations allowing for even more discounts.

Recently Insider took us inside a Ross store reviewing the shopping experience. While they did note that the store was lacking in organization and even seemed bare in some sections there was no doubt that they offered some great items for a very low price. But there is one type of item that you should probably avoid when shopping at Ross.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndlc2EuZm0vMjAyMS0wNS0yOS9zaG90cy1yZXBvcnRlZC1hdC1yb3NzLXBhcmstbWFsbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Two Detained Four Sought After Gunfire At Ross Park Mall,"Ross Township Police detained two minors and are searching for four more people possibly connected to a report of shots fired Saturday at Ross Park Mall Detective Sergeant Brian Kohlhepp told reporters.

No charges have been filed but based on interviews with witnesses police determined as many as three shots were fired inside the mall. No injuries were reported. Officers recovered three handguns.

Police investigated reports of a second round of gunshots in a nearby neighborhood but said they were unable to determine if that incident was connected to the shots fired at the mall. Kohlhepp said police did not turn up evidence of a second shooting.

Speaking with reporters Saturday night Kohlhepp said he could not comment on what prompted the gunfire. He said he saw a video of the fight on Twitter however “and it looks like it was just a simple fight that occurred and during that fight firearms were pulled.” The fight occurred near guest services between the mall food court and JC Penney.

“We are currently at an investigative disadvantage” Kohlhepp said. He said the department repeatedly has asked the mall’s owner Simon Property Group to install a network of security cameras throughout the facility but “they have continually refused to do that.”

“It would have been great for our [special response team] to be able to have eyes in and throughout the mall … as opposed to just sending officers in there blind.”

Kohlhepp said the department historically has relied on footage from individual stores that do have cameras. He urged members of the public to share any video or photos of the incident with Ross Township Police 412-931-9070.

Kohlhepp said the evacuation of the mall went smoothly and that no one was injured in the process.

“Luckily we’ve done a number of drills here and we have good cooperation with the Ross Park Mall that helped us to facilitate that” Kohlhepp said.

Pittsburgh Public Safety Allegheny County Police and officers from multiple departments in the North Hills all responded to the incident. FBI agents also were on the scene.

Mall Patrons Describe ‘Total Chaos’

Around 5 p.m. an altercation broke out near the mall food court according to a witness who asked not to be named saying she was shaken by the experience. The witness said she saw someone in a gray hooded sweatshirt fall to the ground and curl into the fetal position. Then everyone nearby started running and she heard people yelling “He’s got a gun” and “Gun!”

The witness said people crowded into stores and “they were clawing trying to get into any store they could.”

“It all happened so fast” she said. “I was holding an Auntie Anne’s pretzel in my hand and I threw it away … I was running as fast as I could.”

The witness said she and two relatives ran to the Banana Republic store where workers rushed them to the back and closed the doors to the store. They sheltered there for 45 minutes before members of a police SWAT team led them through a back hallway and to the parking lot.

As the witness and her family members exited the building an officer told them that it was safe outside but directed them to walk as far away as they could and get to their car. It took them roughly 30 minutes to leave the mall due to heavy traffic and a crush of emergency vehicles outside the mall she said.

Hildy Heffernan of Sewickley said she was about to check out in the shoe department at Nordstrom when she heard a gunshot. She and other customers rushed into a stockroom and then outside through an exit. Hildy’s husband Paul Heffernan was elsewhere in the store.

“My first concern was finding Paul” she said. “I didn’t know if he was hurt and he didn’t know if I was hurt.”

Paul Heffernan recalled hearing a loud pop and glass shatter. He said he stood up on a chair and started calling his wife’s name until a Nordstrom employee told him he needed to leave the store. Once outside Hildy and Paul found one another.

Hildy described the situation as “total chaos.” She said she and Paul gave an elderly couple a ride to their car on the other side of the mall near J.C. Penney and then left the mall property.

Mall owner Simon Property Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Over the last couple of weeks Royal Caribbean (and its sibling cruise brands) moved the closest yet to real sailings out of the United States and it has a lot of cruise fans excited.

After more than 15 months of no cruises from North America we are swiftly looking at the real prospect of summer cruises. Essentially restart plans went from ""if"" to ""when"" in many people's minds.

While a restart is very close cruise lines are not out of the proverbial woods quite yet and there are some hurdles and challenges left to overcome.

Here are the most important things you should know about Royal Caribbean's restart plans.

Adults (and some kids) need to be vaccinated

For months Royal Caribbean was uncertain if passengers would need to be vaccinated and the answer now appears to be yes.

If you are thinking about going on a cruise ship this summer or fall you will need to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19.

The cruise line updated its policy recently to all adults over the age of 16 on North American sailings will need to be vaccinated in order to go on a cruise before August 1. After August 1 that age restriction drops to 12 years old.

Royal Caribbean has not said much since the policy was changed but it is clear they are looking to mitigate risk as much as possible. In an industry that is unfairly and unfortunately associated with outbreaks they cannot afford to take chances.

Could this policy change? Certainly as life gets back to normal and the vaccine becomes more widely available there is always a chance this policy could be relaxed. But in the meantime plan to be vaccinated if you want to cruise this summer.

Test cruises will be necessary first

While Celebrity Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line are going to straight to revenue sailings Royal Caribbean International will have to conduct test cruises first and then move to revenue sailings.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) gave cruise lines two choices: get 95% of passengers and 98% of crew fully vaccinated and skip test cruises or do test cruises first.

Royal Caribbean opted to do test cruises simply because they are a family cruise line and knew they could not get to 95% of its guests fully vaccinated primarily due to the amount of children onboard.

This means each ship will need to conduct a series of test cruises to demonstrate its new health protocols can work before the CDC will approve a ship to sail with paying passengers.

Speaking of test cruises if you are interested in being a volunteer on a test cruise there does appear to be a way to volunteer and hope you get picked.

So far Royal Caribbean has announced test cruises will begin in June on Freedom of the Seas but expect more ships to get the go-ahead as well.

Slow approach to restart

Don't expect Royal Caribbean to announce all most or even half of its ships restarting immediately. Or even over the next few months.

For many months Royal Caribbean (and all cruise lines) have been emphatic that their restart will be slow and methodical.

Royal Caribbean Group Chairman and CEO Richard Fain said very early on in the shutdown restart will be structured ""We don't expect that... someday somebody blows a horn and all the ships start operating right away. We think that it will be a gradual start a little bit like society is opening up gradually.""

""So we would imagine that we would start with fewer ships and more likely to be more drive markets in the beginning and then it would then evolve and grow from there.""

As an example Norwegian Cruise Line just announced restart plans for 8 ships and many are not going to begin their first sailings until October or November 2021.

So far Royal Caribbean has only announced Alaska cruises from Seattle as the confirmed sailings from the U.S. this summer.

As cruise fans we are eager to get back onboard on our favorite ships from ports of call nearby but keep expectations inline.

CDC still holds a lot of influence

Like it or not the CDC is still mostly in charge.

The road to restart goes right through the CDC's jurisdiction and the cruise lines seem to be past trying to shake them off and are now focused on getting approval to sail.

The tone of discussions with the CDC has radically improved lately especially with the CDC rolling back burdensome rules and protocols.

Perhaps more surprising is cruises sailing from outside the United States still seem to be based on CDC guidance.

Royal Caribbean has not released its health protocols for Adventure of the Seas cruises from Nassau Bahamas due to in part the CDC.

An email update yesterday told guests ""As we’ve been working to finalize all the details we’re taking a lot into consideration including the CDC’s recommendations Bahamian Health Authority’s guidance and our own Healthy Sail Panel’s expertise – to find that sweet spot.""

No matter where ships sail this summer the CDC will be along for the ride for at least a while longer.

Florida

Celebrity Cruises referred to it as ""the elephant in the room"" and Florida has gone from chief enabler to major blocker of cruises restarting.

In short Florida passed a law that prohibits any business from asking their customers for proof of vaccination. While this may make sense in the case of restaurants or supermarkets it creates an enormous problem for cruise lines who are battling a sensationalized media that counts any case onboard a ship as a modern day Pandora's Box.

The Governor's office has been adamant about enforcing the policy across the board including the cruise lines. Meanwhile cruise executives are talking about some kind of compromise that is in the works.

What ends up happening is anyone's guess but Florida is the epicenter of the cruise world and while ships could sail from other states it is a market too large to ignore.

In the meantime it is a story to keep an eye on as it relates to where and when cruise ships will be able to sail from first.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bi1zZW50aW5lbC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8zMC9iYXR0bGUtZm9yLXRoZS1zZWFzLWNydWlzZS1saW5lcy1wcmVwYXJlLXRvLXNhaWwtYnV0LWNsYXNoLXdpdGgtZGVzYW50aXMtbG9vbXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruises face uncertainty in fight with Gov.

After working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for 15 months (since the “No Sail Order” was put into place) the cruise line will operate its Celebrity Cruises ship Celebrity Edge on June 26th for a seven-night western Caribbean trip.

The trip that will visit both the Bahamas and Mexico will cruise from Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale one of the busiest cruise terminals in the country. The departure location was likely chosen both due to infrastructure and as a symbolic gesture. Florida offers cruises from all over the state including Tampa Jacksonville and Port Canaveral adjoining the Kennedy Space Center.

But wait there’s more.

New Law

In order to become approved for the cruise outside of the No Sail Order RCL had to ensure all travelers and crew members would be fully vaccinated.

“Celebrity Cruises spokesperson Susan Lomax said the company has opted to comply with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccination threshold and will require all crew and passengers 16 years old and older to be vaccinated. The age requirement will drop to 12 years old on Aug. 1.”

However Florida Governor DeSantis just signed SB 2006 into law that states that makes it impossible for RCL to ask for proof of vaccination.

“Additionally the legislation codifies the prohibition of COVID-19 vaccine passports. Governor DeSantis enacted this prohibition through an executive order last month blocking any business or government entity from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination.”

A spokesman for Governor DeSantis extemporized outside of the press release the exact conundrum that the cruise lines will find themselves in:

“We’ve been very clear the law is clear in Florida” said Taryn Fenske spokesperson for the governor. “You can’t mandate vaccine passports. We are interested to see how the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) works with them so that they don’t get these exorbitant fines.” – Tampa Bay Times

Will It Sail?

The question remains as to whether or not the first new cruise will actually sail.

To review:

The CDC had prohibited new sailings but has allowed this one so long as all the passengers and crew are vaccinated.

Florida law prohibits and can fine (up to $5000) any business that asks customers their vaccination status

That leaves this ship and future cruises in choppy waters. How can Royal Caribbean prove to the CDC that it has complied and all of their staff and passengers are vaccinated while at the same time not asking it nor requiring it?

The Governor’s order might work well against landlocked permanently affixed businesses but many fly to Florida to start their cruise vacations the prior night cruising the next morning. Would those travelers choose to fly to Galveston New York Boston or San Diego instead? Will cruise lines who have to remain compliant with both the ports they serve and the overarching governmental departments like the TSA Homeland Security and in this case the CDC move their best ships out of those cruise ports for the time being?

In the case of the larger return to the water the above issues may move ports of call elsewhere but for this particular cruise it will set sail prior to SB 2006’s enactment on July 1st 2021 and therefore it will likely sail regardless.

Conclusion

Governor DeSantis might have scored a victory for his right-leaning electorate in the fight against vaccine passports and required vaccination (and disclosure) of its citizenry. Businesses can still choose to require masks or take other precautions they can also shut their doors if they choose to only sell to vaccinated persons and require proof of inoculation. However if cruise lines feel that they must sail with explicit knowledge of the vaccination staff of passengers and cannot do so in the state of Florida the Governor may have some very upset local business owners. That is if both cruise lines and passengers both choose against cruises from Florida. It should make for an interesting showdown.

What do you think? Will the first new cruise set sail? Will Florida acquiesce or allow exceptions? Will the CDC be able to enforce its vaccination requirement?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJveWFsY2FyaWJiZWFuYmxvZy5jb20vYm9hcmRzL2luZGV4LnBocD8vdG9waWMvMjMzODAtYWxhc2thLWxhbmQtdG91ci10aHJvdWdoLXJjLW9yLW9uLXlvdXItb3duL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alaska land tour: through RC or on your own?,"Join the conversation

If she makes that rank – and she is working toward it she’s now the fifth-highest ranking bridge officer in a crew of 1200 on Royal Caribbean’s Navigator of the Seas – Seymour will become the first Bahamian female to captain a cruise ship of that magnitude with responsibility for anywhere between 1200 and 2500 other crew members in addition to up to 6800 guests.

It’s a career she has been preparing for since she first went to sea crewing on the Dean’s Shipping mailboat MV Legend. At 18 and fresh out of St. Augustine’s College she spent a year working on the ship making regular hops between West Palm Beach Green Turtle Cay and Marsh Harbour in the Abacos and Nassau. She also crewed on its frequent charters to islands throughout The Bahamas.

Seymour’s love of math her determination to learn celestial navigation and her instinctual understanding of ship stability and loading factors drove her to go further at sea. She did what few females have ever done – becoming one woman among an all-male crew aboard a cargo ship sometimes out to sea for months. The job was through Bahamas-based Campbell Shipping. The voyages were worldwide.

“We went all over one day we’d be doing China to Vancouver and the next we’d be doing South America to Europe” says Seymour now 29. Back then in her early 20s often with crew who hailed from India she drew on every ounce of mental strength she had. It wasn’t just the obvious concern about being the only female in a crew of 24 in an isolated world. The worst part was the daily treatment.

“In the beginning I was assigned jobs every day like chipping painting and mopping when I really wanted to be on the bridge learning everything I could” she said. Refusing to break under the gender prejudice Seymour took it upon herself to learn on her own what she could about cargo loading ship husbandry meteorology and celestial navigation. Finally on her second contract with the company a new captain recognized her commitment and took the time to teach her.

She remained with Campbell Shipping for six and half years working on bulk carriers spending Christmases and birthdays thousands of miles from home. Contracts were seven months on two months off. During the off-time she studied. She earned licenses from South Tyneside College in the U.K. and elsewhere.

Today Seymour holds the highest certification earned by a Bahamian female Chief Officer Unlimited and she is close to earning her Master Mariner license.

Her most frightening moment came during a freak storm.

“We were a few miles off the coast of China on our way to Canada when we were hit by a typhoon” she recalled. “We were literally ‘dancing’ on the bridge. I was sitting in a chair and the rogue wave came up and flung the chair. I slid from the port side all the way to the starboard.” The storm blew up so suddenly crew members had no time to tie themselves to lifelines. Not worried that she could have been tossed overboard she was fearful that the 189-meter ship (620 feet long) would capsize.

“I think people think the life aboard cargo ships is easy but it is much more difficult” says Seymour. “You are very isolated you have to be very strong-willed. You are all alone for long periods of time.”

With certifications and licenses in hand Seymour left the cargo world took a chance and applied online for a position at Royal Caribbean.

In March 2019 she landed the job and is now second officer in charge of all life-saving and firefighting equipment and appliances and keeping navigational watch on the 3800-passemger 1020-foot-long Navigator of the Seas. She had one good year before the pandemic hit leading to the ship being at anchor for 14 months.

“I love it” she said. “Coming from cargo ships to passenger ships it was like starting life over going from isolation to being with people who are having fun and thoroughly enjoy their job. And I love the atmosphere at Royal Caribbean. They are always encouraging you to learn more study more take this training do that so you can move up within the company. It’s a great atmosphere.”

If Seymour gets her wish to captain a Royal Caribbean Group ship she will be the first Bahamian but not the first female. In 2007 Royal Caribbean named Swedish mariner Karin Stahre-Janson captain of Monarch of the Seas and in 2015 Kate McCue 43 became the first American female captain when she took the helm of Royal Caribbean Group’s Celebrity Summit. Today McCue is captain of the luxury cruise line’s newest ship Celebrity Edge.

Seymour may not have a quarter million Instagram followers like McCue just yet but she has a family that is continually amazed by and proud of her.

“I set out a goal and I am accomplishing it. One day I will be the first female Bahamian captain on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship. One day in the next eight to 10 years.”

We wouldn’t be surprised Ivanna if it came sooner than that.

Bahamian Ivanna Seymour worked on a mailboat then spent nearly seven years on bulk carriers isolated from the outside world for months at a time before joining Royal Caribbean in 2019 and taking on the highest post of a Bahamian female second officer. She hopes one day to become the first Bahamian female captain of a Royal Caribbean cruise ship. Royal Caribbean Group named its first female captain in 2007 and eight years later its first American woman to take the helm of one of its Celebrity Cruises ships."

I want to be very clear here I am NOT advocating for driving over the speed limit. (65 all the way baby.) What I am saying is hypothetically if you are inclined to drive fast a good choice of vehicle would be something powerful yet subtle. Something practical but also well built and low key that does not immediately draw the attention of law enforcement. And also something fully electric because nothing makes you more incognito on the road than silence.

The Acura ZDX is that very something that ticks all of these boxes.

The first full electric from Acura the ZDX is a midsize crossover SUV that doesn’t immediately clock as a midsize crossover SUV. The lines are all low slung and the back end has a pleasing boxiness. The car is mostly blacked out from the beltline up giving the roof a floating appearance. It’s a bit luxe but equally understated.

MullenLowe The Acura ZDX.

It’s stylish but also practical. At its very practical heart the ZDX is built on GM’s Ultium platform a modular electric propulsion system that can be tweaked to fit a bunch of different vehicles from light trucks to cars to SUVs like the ZDX. Acura partnered with GM in the hopes it could fast track a fully electric entry without developing one from the ground up internally. You know what? It works. The battery tech feels mature with the ZDX getting around 300 miles of range per charge.

If there is one stat on the ZDX that is actually eye-catching it would have to be the 499 horsepower and and 544 lb-ft of torque of the Type S variants. The car also weighs in at over six thousand pounds yet it still rips—0-60mph is reached in 4.2 seconds. Things feel solid and predictable even after the speedometer starts creeping into the low triple digits – not that I would ever go that fast officer. Keep in mind this isn’t some autobahn thrashing import that you can comfortably take to a buck fifty without so much as a window rattle. The ZDX glides quickly and effortlessly from point to point but if you’re looking for something that can chew asphalt and rip through tight corners then you might have to switch to something fossil fuel powered like BMW’s X4 M or the unhinged Dodge Durango Hellcat.

Like virtually all electric vehicles the ZDX features regen braking which you can adjust through driving modes or on the steering wheel paddle. On the strongest setting the regen brakes are grabby enough to use one pedal driving. There are also standard brakes too – 15.3 inch front brake rotors! – but if you’re in regen braking mode they’ll hardly ever be used.

MullenLowe The illuminated front end of the ZDX.

The interior is spacious—far more than it looks on the outside—particularly in the cargo area which has a 28.7 cubic foot capacity. A number of car companies—looking at you BMW and Mercedes—have copied Tesla’s homework and eliminated virtually all physical buttons from their electric offerings. Look we’re assaulted by screens all day long and it’s nice to get into a ride and have the tactile pleasure of flicking an actual switch. The ZDX’s array of physical buttons knobs and switches for controlling everything from the entertainment to driving options to adaptive cruise control are a delight. The Type S variant also has Hands Free Cruise Acura's version of GM's Super Cruise hands-free driving tech which you can’t imagine living without if your commute has any semblance of traffic.

MullenLowe The Acura ZDX.

The ZDX occupies an interesting space. It’s a good—maybe great—alternative to the Tesla Model Y Mercedes EQB and BMW iX. It’s also quicker than most crossover electrics and somewhat stealthy—the CHP will definitely pull over the guy in the Ferrari Purosangue before he pulls over you in the ZDX. If you still find yourself itching for bigger thrills in an Acura maybe the best move would be to get something a little more fiery like one of their fun-as-hell Integra reissues. But if you’re looking for a reliable electric ride for people and cargo that delivers a good dosage of zoom the ZDX Type S is a very good bet.

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

Kennedy Jr.’s running mate complained on Thursday that she was “slandered” and had to “take a walk to shake it off.”

Shanahan who has been bankrolling RFK Jr.’s spoiler-ready campaign for president with the fortune she got in her divorce from Google founder Sergey Brin did not raise any specific objection to the story which she said she didn’t read until nearly a full day after it was published.

But she did go into detail about an almost cinematic encounter she had on her walk when she “pulled into a farmers market to say hello to the farmers.”

“I walked by a young man on the empty side of the parking lot who recognized me and said ‘Nicole Shanahan!’ and said he was a supporter of Bobby and watched my speech” she wrote on X.

“He said he studied the psychology of politics in college. I told him about the article and how I was trying to walk it off. He told me he had watched the ‘Who is Bobby Kennedy’ film which is specifically about how cruel and embarrassingly desperate the left-wing media can be.”

“He’s 23 years old. I looked up at the sky and then said to this young man ‘thank you you are just what I needed in this moment to keep going strong.’ His name is Alex. Thank you Alex.”

The Daily Beast reached out to the Kennedy campaign after her post but did not get an immediate response. The Daily Beast could not reach Alex because no last name was provided but he can contact us at tips@thedailybeast.com at any time.

The story that Shanahan appeared to be referring to detailed her meteoric rise from a turbulent childhood in Oakland California to the wife—and then ex-wife—of one of the richest men in the country as well as the running mate of a conspiracy theory-driven third-party presidential candidate who could hand the election to Donald Trump.

The Beast story the result of more than a dozen interviews and several weeks of work was highlighted by top tech journalist Kara Swisher on Threads on Thursday. In particular Swisher noted that a source who has spent significant time with Shanahan scoffed at Kennedy’s description of her as an artificial intelligence expert with the source saying that she “couldn’t differentiate ‘AI from a tennis ball.’”

Swisher then went on to add “And more: Unsuccessful entrepreneur losing lawyer bloviating nonsense on all manner of things she has no expertise in marriage incompetence and she’s just plainly a candidate for a thirsty wack job because she managed to get a pile of money from a tech billionaire who wanted her to go away.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvcmZrLWpyLWphY2stc2NobG9zc2JlcmcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Using Cartoonish Accents J.F.K.'s Grandson Insults and Mocks Robert F.

Schlumberger-Guyana Inc.’s planned construction of a “Source Storage and Calibration Building” facility at 1 Area X Houston EBD Georgetown which was given EPA approval only came to the attention of the majority of residents of Houston and surrounding communities through news reports in late April and early May. The EPA’s Notice to the Public dated April 11 2021 which was subsequently found on its website did not provide any substantive reasons for how it arrived at this approval and the basis for waiving an EIA. Rather the notice simply states that “it has been determined that the projects will not significantly affect the environment or human health and are therefore exempt from the requirement for an EIA.” No further explanation was provided. It is not clear what evidence or information was used to make this determination.

We were/are alarmed to find out that the Schlumberger-Guyana Inc. Source Storage and Calibration facility involves the handling storage and installation of radioactive sources and the processing and disposal of hazardous industrial waste including oil-contaminated materials. It is well-documented that these substances by their very nature pose serious risks to the environment and human health. Under Guyana’s Constitution and international human rights treaties citizens have a right to participate in decision-making and be informed of ‘developments’ which impacts our communities and environment including suitability of location for construction and operation of such a facility track record of company in handling hazardous waste mitigation measures and safeguards for securing and disposing of radioactive material and disaster preparedness to name a few. One news report stated in April that construction was 75% completed. Our view is that the EPA’s approval for this facility violates principles of environmental management set out in the Environment Protection Act including the precautionary principle. Specifically the Environmental Protection Act dictates that in performing its functions the EPA shall make use of current principles of environmental management including the precautionary principle and the avoidance principle. The “precautionary” principle states that “where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation” (article 4(b) Constitution). The “avoidance” principle states that “it is preferable to avoid environmental damage as it can be impossible or more expensive to repair rather than prevent damage” (article 4(d) Constitution).

It is unclear what information the EPA used to determine that the project would not have a significant effect on the environment or human health. The only information we could find about the possible impacts of Schlumberger’s proposed project in Guyana is in Schlumberger’s own Project Summary on environmental effects. This section only has about 146 words and is overwhelmingly lacking in detail. This section states very briefly that the project will have no environmental effects. The Project Summary does not provide details about the risks associated with radioactive sources hazardous industrial waste and mitigation measures. Moreover the Project Summary leaves out key details such as safety measures for the transportation of hazardous waste and radioactive sources safe disposal from the accumulated hazardous substances plans in the event of a spill or industrial accidents on site and or in the transportation of these hazardous and radioactive materials from Guyana’s EEZ zone into and along the Demerara River. Neither is there any detailed environmental plan for the containment mitigation or protection measures for accidental release of such hazardous substances into the environment nor any mention of consequences of risks and endangerment of citizens communities and environment. International conventions and best practice emphasize the importance of proper regulation and management of radioactive waste including through environmental assessments before construction of such facilities begins. The Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management for example states that Contracting Parties shall take the appropriate steps to ensure that procedures are established and implemented for a proposed radioactive waste management facility to evaluate the safety impact of such a facility on individuals society and the environment taking into account possible evolution of the site conditions of disposal facilities after closure. In addition “before construction of a radioactive waste management facility a systematic safety assessment and an environmental assessment appropriate to the hazard presented by the facility and covering its operating lifetime shall be carried out.” Radioactive waste management is defined broadly to include all activities including decommissioning activities in the handling pretreatment treatment conditioning storage or disposal of radioactive waste.

Additionally we do not understand how EPA granted approval for such a facility to be located in a residential area. Guyana’s zoning categories as we were informed are residential commercial residential/commercial and industrial. According to our information industrial facilities factories and harmful storage sites should never be located constructed built or operated in a residential area. Schlumberger Guyana Inc planned construction of a “Source Storage and Calibration Building” facility at 1 Area X Houston EBD is ‘slam bang’ located in the communities of Houston Houston Estate Houston Village/Housing Scheme with close proximity to adjoining communities of McDoom Agricola Eccles etc. Houston Nursery and Houston Secondary Schools are just across the road from where this facility is being constructed as are health centres community centres faith based places of worship and wells for potable water. The UN World Conference on Human Rights reaffirms in its Declaration on the Right to Development that “The human person is the central subject of development. The right to development should be fulfilled so as to meet equitably the developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations. The Regional Agreement on Access to Information Public Participation and Justice in Environmental matters in Latin America and the Caribbean also known as the “Escazú Agreement “ came into full effect in April 2021. President Irfaan Ali affirmed Guyana’s commitment to it in his speech on Earth Day April 22 and stating its importance to the sustainable development of the Region. Escazú guarantees “full and effective implementation of the rights of access to environmental information public participation and justice” and protects the rights of citizens to live in a healthy environment. In other words it guarantees access to environmental information consultation in environmental decision making processes right to take legal action in cases of environmental damage promotes and defends the rights of environmental and human rights defenders indigenous peoples and communities.

Based on the above we have requested that the EPA conduct a comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESA) of Schlumberger Guyana Inc.’s “Source Storage and Calibration Building” facility at 1 Area X Houston EBD. We have also written also to the Minister of Housing the Georgetown Mayor & City Council and the Central and Housing Planning Authority to clarify zoning issues surrounding the location of this facility for waste including hazardous waste including radioactive waste and installation of radioactive sources within residential communities.

Sincerely

The 22-story Radian at 659 Ninth Avenue will include 241 apartments above the old building with Target taking up 36000 square feet of the ground floor and a basement level of the historic building.

Cisterra Development will break ground this summer on a 22-story apartment building in East Village. Rendering courtesy of Cisterra Development. A five-level parking garage will be built on top of the Farkas building sandwiched between the historic structure and 16 levels of apartments said Jason Wood a principal of Cisterra.

Construction is expected to wrap up in summer 2023. Saving History

Cisterra will restore about 400 linear feet of the façade of historic building – about 200 linear feet on F Street and 100 linear feet each along 10th Avenue and 9th Avenue Wood said.

Cisterra worked with Save Our Heritage Organization and the City of San Diego Historical Resources Board in designing the restoration.

Built in 1932 as the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company garage the building has been designated as historic.

“The Farkas Building was a key to the beginning of the design” Wood said.

“Refurbishing it was essential and we wanted to work with it to have it stand on its own but then be able to put a new tower above it.”

The parking garage serves the function of creating a gap between the new and the old letting both sections stand on their own Wood said.

“Having that five levels of parking created a nice podium then on the seventh level enabled us to create this outdoor-indoor fitness center” Wood said. The Apartments

Unlike many other downtown apartment or condominium towers that reserve the upper floors for pricey penthouse units Radian will cluster amenities on the top floor that will include a hot tub swimming pool barbecue area cabanas individual and group seating areas a theater wall a wine tasting room a game room and an event space and kitchen.

There also will be a dog park on the seventh floor.

Five penthouse apartments ranging from about 1700 square feet at about 1900 square feet will be on the upper levels but beneath the top floor.

Radian also stands apart from the other towers by not having any studio apartments Wood said.

Instead the Radian will have what Wood called junior one-bedroom apartments of about 625 square feet.

“We decided to create these units where they can open up so they can feel like a studio but they’re large enough that you could close off rooms so it’s really a one-bedroom so the resident could have privacy” Wood said.

The remaining apartments will range from about 800 square feet to about 1000 square feet.

About half of the apartments will have balconies.

Monthly rents haven’t been set.

“We’re two years out. We’re going to see where the market goes” Wood said.

Target

The addition of Target to the project will bring a needed shopping venue to the East Village said Miro Copic a professor of marketing at San Diego State University and co-founder and principal partner at Bottomline Marketing.

“It’s a very strong brand and one that is aligned with the sensibilities of residents of that area” Copic said. “It’s going to help bolster all the other types of retail that’s in the area.”

Retail in general was hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic but Target was one of the exceptions Copic said.

Target recently reported that its earnings for the first quarter of 2021 rose 23%.

“During the pandemic Target and Walmart were huge winners” Copic said.

The overall project won accolades from the East Village Association and the Downtown San Diego Partnership.

“Cisterra Development has a history of creating iconic buildings that have enhanced the downtown skyline and urban experience” said Betsy Brennan president and CEO of the Downtown San Diego Partnership.

“We’re excited to see Radian come online as an example of how a thoughtfully designed property can honor downtown’s history while also furthering the character of our urban neighborhoods as vibrant places to live work and play” Brennan said.

Diane Peabody Straw executive director of the East Village Association said the project “will be an exceptionally crafted modern high-rise that also honors and preserves one of the neighborhood’s historic buildings.”

“East Village is an ideal neighborhood to welcome Radian and Target which will provide a unique retail and residential experience for residents employees and visitors in the area” Straw said.

Joint venture partners in Radian with Cisterra are The Korman Group Wermers Properties and a private investor Wood said.

Carrier Johnson + Culture is the architect.

Cisterra’s other downtown projects included DiamondView Tower and Sempra Energy’s headquarters. The company also recently completed new corporate headquarters in Kearny Mesa for Cubic.",,,,,,,,,,,,

HF&G’s largest fundraising event of the year Twilight in the Whimsical Woods will take place throughout the Holden Arboretum grounds from 5:30 to 8:30 p.m. July 10.

This is a reimaging of the annual Woodland Twilight benefit and will feature a picnic dinner by A Taste of Excellence music by Northeast Ohio artists including Thor Platter and The Cleveland Wind Trio activities for adults and children and a chance to view the new Fairy Doors: Magical Garden Gateways exhibit.

The exhibit which opens to the public July 6 is an expanded version of the one that debuted last year and will extend to the Botanical Garden as well.

“Since preparations began in the midst of the ongoing pandemic our planning committee wanted to develop something unique that the entire family could enjoy safely” Holden President and CEO Jill Koski said of the fundraiser. “We also love that the new event format takes advantage of the gardens collections and landscapes in new ways. Guests will get to see far more of the Arboretum than at previous events.

Proceeds will support HF&G’s People for Trees movement announced in February with the aim of combatting urban tree canopy loss and having 15000 trees planted and cared for throughout Northeast Ohio by 2025.

The goal is to raise more than $75000 from the event for the programming side of People for Trees.

“People for Trees is not only a movement to encourage the public to plant and care for 15000 trees by 2025 but also encompasses all of our work around conservation community forestry research Tree Corps and education” Koski said.

About 1700 people have pledged to plant at least one tree on their property thus far. Additionally HF&G has commitments to plant 1900 trees as an organization for a total of 3600-plus trees.

“We are thrilled with and grateful for this response to our campaign” Koski said.

The cost to attend the July 10 fundraising event is as follows:

Patron: $250 ($190 tax-deductible) – includes choice of meal program listing branded picnic blanket and wine tumbler

Adult: $125 ($75 tax-deductible) – includes choice of meal and branded wine tumbler

No charges have been filed but based on interviews with witnesses police determined as many as three shots were fired inside the mall. No injuries were reported. Officers recovered three handguns.

Police investigated reports of a second round of gunshots in a nearby neighborhood but said they were unable to determine if that incident was connected to the shots fired at the mall. Kohlhepp said police did not turn up evidence of a second shooting.

Speaking with reporters Saturday night Kohlhepp said he could not comment on what prompted the gunfire. He said he saw a video of the fight on Twitter however “and it looks like it was just a simple fight that occurred and during that fight firearms were pulled.” The fight occurred near guest services between the mall food court and JC Penney.

“We are currently at an investigative disadvantage” Kohlhepp said. He said the department repeatedly has asked the mall’s owner Simon Property Group to install a network of security cameras throughout the facility but “they have continually refused to do that.”

“It would have been great for our [special response team] to be able to have eyes in and throughout the mall … as opposed to just sending officers in there blind.”

Kohlhepp said the department historically has relied on footage from individual stores that do have cameras. He urged members of the public to share any video or photos of the incident with Ross Township Police 412-931-9070.

Kohlhepp said the evacuation of the mall went smoothly and that no one was injured in the process.

“Luckily we’ve done a number of drills here and we have good cooperation with the Ross Park Mall that helped us to facilitate that” Kohlhepp said.

Pittsburgh Public Safety Allegheny County Police and officers from multiple departments in the North Hills all responded to the incident. FBI agents also were on the scene.

Mall Patrons Describe ‘Total Chaos’

Around 5 p.m. an altercation broke out near the mall food court according to a witness who asked not to be named saying she was shaken by the experience. The witness said she saw someone in a gray hooded sweatshirt fall to the ground and curl into the fetal position. Then everyone nearby started running and she heard people yelling “He’s got a gun” and “Gun!”

The witness said people crowded into stores and “they were clawing trying to get into any store they could.”

“It all happened so fast” she said. “I was holding an Auntie Anne’s pretzel in my hand and I threw it away … I was running as fast as I could.”

The witness said she and two relatives ran to the Banana Republic store where workers rushed them to the back and closed the doors to the store. They sheltered there for 45 minutes before members of a police SWAT team led them through a back hallway and to the parking lot.

As the witness and her family members exited the building an officer told them that it was safe outside but directed them to walk as far away as they could and get to their car. It took them roughly 30 minutes to leave the mall due to heavy traffic and a crush of emergency vehicles outside the mall she said.

Hildy Heffernan of Sewickley said she was about to check out in the shoe department at Nordstrom when she heard a gunshot. She and other customers rushed into a stockroom and then outside through an exit. Hildy’s husband Paul Heffernan was elsewhere in the store.

“My first concern was finding Paul” she said. “I didn’t know if he was hurt and he didn’t know if I was hurt.”

Paul Heffernan recalled hearing a loud pop and glass shatter. He said he stood up on a chair and started calling his wife’s name until a Nordstrom employee told him he needed to leave the store. Once outside Hildy and Paul found one another.

Hildy described the situation as “total chaos.” She said she and Paul gave an elderly couple a ride to their car on the other side of the mall near J.C. Penney and then left the mall property.

Mall owner Simon Property Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A loan on the Prizm Outlets mall outside Las Vegas realized a 120 percent loss after the property sold at auction for just over $400000 according to Bloomberg News. The buyer was not revealed but New York-based Kohan Retail Investment Group now lists the property on its website.

The total realized loss for the $62.2 million loan accounting for fees and reimbursements to the master servicer was $74 million. It’s the largest loss for a CMBS loan since 2008 according to Bank of America.

The Prizm sale was the first auction of a property linked to CMBX 6 a credit derivatives index that has heavy exposure to malls and shopping centers. Of its 39 malls 31 are impaired according to MP Securitized Credit Partners which is shorting the index.

Carl Icahn is another investor shorting the index. Icahn has preached the short since it became clear the pandemic would devastate brick-and-mortar retailers and properties.

“We believe these mortgages will have the same disastrous fate as mortgage-backed securities had in the 2008 debacle” Icahn told Bloomberg this week.

Icahn and other investors betting on those debts have already cashed out on some of their bets. Some of the biggest mall investors in the country including Simon Property Group and Starwood Capital Group have defaulted on loans.

Why doesn’t the Fed share the rest of the world’s concerns about food inflation?

The impact of food inflation differs across countries and income levels

The Federal Reserve regards current inflation conditions to be transitory. They see the impact of food inflation as minimal since the weighting of food and beverages on the overall CPI basket is only 10% to 15%. The U.S. CPI is heavily weighted towards housing. The core PCE price index one of the central bank’s favorite measures of inflation excludes the more volatile and seasonal food and energy prices. Through this lens the Fed is correct is in their assessment but that’s not the story for the rest of the world. In most emerging economies food and beverage is a much more important part of their consumer baskets (see graphs below).

Changes in relative currency valuation over the past year have made the matter even worse for some countries. For example Brazil has experienced greater demand for exports because they are cheaper for foreign buyers and as such their domestic supply has become strained.

Likewise food inflation creates a heavier burden for lower income families widening the wealth gap globally.

Why does the food industry worry about inflation?

As early as Q3/Q4 2020 quite a few food companies expressed concerns about inflation. For example in Q1 2021 B&G Foods Inc. (BGS) cited escalating SG&A expenses and input cost inflation as key concerns for the company going forward.

In addition to surging commodities prices pandemic-related restrictions have increased logistical costs over the past year. Even if one assumes that logistical costs will come down as economy recovers wages are likely to trend higher over time. Many food companies will see double-digit increases to their costs this year – some of which are not transitory.

Large food companies such as B&G Foods have been able to pass some cost increases to consumers over the past year but if cost inflation keeps up their pricing power may be limited for several reasons. One is that wholesale retail prices for consumer products generally lag the underlying commodities prices. In 2020 and 2021 YTD corn commodity prices have jumped >20% annually whereas process sweet corn price remained roughly the same (see table below).

% Change YoY 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Consumer Product Processed Sweet Corn Price ($/ton) -10.2% 1.5% -4.9% -2.6% Commodity Corn Commodity Price ($/bushel) -0.4% 6.9% 3.4% 24.8% 28.2%

Another reason is that price competition would likely keep retail prices in check. Walmart said it had about 30% more discounts in stores in Q1 than during the same period a year ago. Retail giants like Walmart can push prices lower due to their comprehensive mix of products and well-managed supply chain. If other companies cannot keep up they may face the tough choice of losing market share or sacrificing margin.

She continued: 'I don't have to say yes to things I don't want to do because my hardest thing to say is ""no"".'

However The Saturdays star did admit she is feeling 'anxious' about the UK reopening as lockdown restrictions are eased explaining she may be tempted to revert to her old ways.

Gogglebox star Nikki Tapper has posted a sweet throwback photo from her wedding day - and she's almost unrecognisable.

Nikki and husband Jonathan are celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary and told fans it ""only feels like yesterday"" that they tied the knot.

She has also revealed the moment she knew her partner was a ""keeper"" reports the Daily Star.

In the post on Instagram she wrote: “Wow 25 Years!!! Happy Silver Wedding anniversary to us! I cannot quite believe where the years have gone and honestly seems like yesterday that I said Yes!

“Jonathan Tapper I knew were a ‘keeper’ from the minute we met and I count my blessings every day and feel so lucky and privileged to be sharing this wonderful journey of life with you my side and of course our beautiful Josh and Amy.

“You still always make me feel special and have the ability to always make me laugh (well most of the time!) and I can’t wait to make so many more memories together in only good health always. Here’s to many more years of ‘us’ love you always and forever (sic).”

Hundreds of people ahve liked the post and congratulated the pair on the silver wedding anniversary.

Their daughter Amy Tapper 21 also shared photos online via her Instagram stories while wishing a ‘Happy 25th wedding anniversary to my favourite people in the world.’

Amy continued: ‘Thank you for everything but most importantly for making me - the perfect 50/50 mixture of the both of you.’

The family no longer appear on Gogglebox with Josh leaving in 2017 and Amy following a year later.

She has since appeared on Celebs Go Dating but the departures of some of the family and Jonathan’s battle with diabetes have not seen the Tapper’s return.

(SIMI VALLEY Calif.) –Today 189 workers at Waste Management Inc. (WMI) voted overwhelmingly by a more than 2-1 margin in favor of joining Teamsters Local 186 in Ventura Calif. The Southern California waste workers are seeking improved working conditions better wages and stronger benefits.

The vote for union representation capped more than a yearlong organizing drive by workers at the company’s Simi Valley Landfill and Recycling Center and marked the first time that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has approved an in-person election since issuing new voting rules in response to the pandemic in November.

“It feels great to finally and officially say that we are Teamsters. We fought hard for this day” said Jesus Orozco a WMI worker and member of the worker-led Justicieros Organizing Committee. “Now we will continue fighting to bargain a contract that guarantees fairness and respect for every worker.”

The WMI workers provide trash and recycling services in the San Fernando Valley including the towns of Reseda Calabasas and Hidden Hills.

“We are thankful for the support we have received from the community and we are grateful to have the Teamsters standing behind us the entire time. It reminded us that this was a campaign for justice” said Jorge Avalos a WMI worker and a leading voice on the organizing committee. “Now that we are Teamsters we will continue to fight and win. We are stronger and more united than ever as we head into negotiations for our first union contract.”

Despite the anti-union campaign waged by the company WMI workers stayed united in their campaign to secure a union voice at the Simi Valley facility.

“This determined group stood strong as the company waged a vicious anti-union campaign going so far as to hire union busters in a desperate attempt to convince workers to vote against their best interests. These workers knew better than to fall for their dirty tricks” said Abel Garcia Principal Officer of Local 186. “It wasn’t only the workers who united against the company’s union busters but their spouses and children also took part in the fight. Together they stood strong for the betterment of their entire family. I have been a Teamster for more than 40 years and this campaign is unlike any I’ve ever seen. It reminded me of when I was teenager watching Cesar Chavez. This is a victory that will go down in the books.”

Local 186 is already preparing to bargain the WMI workers a first contract. In addition to improved pay and benefits the workers are also seeking respect on the job and safer working conditions.

“On behalf of the Teamsters Waste Division I want to congratulate Simi Valley workers on their overwhelming victory at Waste Management today. Our division is proud of what they have accomplished throughout the campaign for Teamster representation. These workers now have a more secure future under a strong union voice” said Chuck Stiles Director of the Teamsters Solid Waste and Recycling Division.

The Teamsters Solid Waste and Recycling Division represents thousands of WMI workers at locations nationwide.

Founded in 1903 the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.4 million hardworking men and women throughout the United States Canada and Puerto Rico.

They're all worthy discussions but it all starts with the hot dog itself which if it's from North Carolina is most likely to be dyed a shade of bright red more reminiscent of Cheerwine than cooked meat. It's not natural but it's part of the nature of North Carolina.

With so many of our state's hot dogs bearing close resemblance to one another the proof of the pudding is in the eating as they say.

And eat I did. I wrangled up 11 different hot dogs and red hots from Greensboro to Rocky Mount and many spots in between.

How do they all compare to each other? I decided to find out just in time for your Memorial Day cookout.

Criteria:

All the dogs were broiled until hot and lightly charred. Hot dogs franks and red hots were included in this tasting. Smoked sausages were not included. The dogs were tasted plain without condiments and were judged on flavor texture and appearance.

Note that even the last-ranked hot dog was still passable and far better than the Armour hot dogs of my childhood. Buy local. You won't regret it.

Without further ado here are the 11 dogs ranked from least favorite to the winner.

11. Bright Leaf Red Hots

OK not exactly what I expected from the state's preeminent hot dog producer. For the uninitiated red hots are more short and squat than their slender hot dog cousins with a bit of heat and spice added to the mix.

Carolina Packers which is not some Steagles-esque NFC hybrid but rather the makers of Bright Leaf is well-represented in this judging with more than a third of the products in this judging bearing their tobacco leaf logo.

But these pork-and-beef sausages were just way too soft with an almost pâté-like center. They lacked the spice of the other red hots and they weren't especially meaty leaving the whole experience a fairly bland one.

Perhaps splitting the dog down the middle and cooking it on a griddle would improve the texture but compared with the others this one just fell short.

10. Curtis Classic Franks

The first thing that stands out about these hot dogs is their color. They're pink. Bright pink like cotton candy or bubble gum. Look quickly and you might think they're pink candy cigars.

That's where the superlatives end. These hot dogs made with pork turkey and beef in that order are remarkably bland. I wouldn't even describe them as being salty despite having 510mg of sodium per 1.2-ounce dog which is a remarkable amount of sodium to pack into such a small hot dog.

9. Bright Leaf Smokehouse Franks

Once again I had high hopes for Bright Leaf the Smithfield-based pork product producer who has been making sausages since 1939.

These pork and beef dogs are served eight to each one-pound package making for a far more plump sausage than one of the others. The lack of bright red color — though these still do contain artificial colors — and picture of an old wooden smokehouse on the package make you harken back to a simpler time.

Unfortunately the hot dogs were simple too. There was no smoky flavor at all nor was there much of any flavor in general. You can't have any offensive flavors if you don't have any flavors right? *taps forehead*

Smokehouse dogs are in the doghouse for me. If only they were in an actual smokehouse too.

Hidden Gems of Fayetteville:Barbecue is the Broadway star at this family-run spot

8. Star's Red Hots

If this were a contest of sheer variety Star's would win hands-down. You'll find this Burlington food company's pimento cheese prepared salads Brunswick stew chicken and dumplings and pork barbecue in supermarkets across the state. They even make gelatin parfaits.

How do they do in the sausage game? Not bad. These red hots have a bit more heat than the Bright Leaf ones but lack the meatiness of some of the top finishers. They also have a slightly greasy flavor I found off-putting and indicative of inferior ingredients such as mechanically separated chicken the first ingredient of these red hots.

7. Bright Leaf skinless frankfurters

They're both the same brand. Both say ""skinless frankfurters"" on the front of the package. The only obvious difference is that one comes in a 12-ounce vacuum-sealed package with the labeling printed directly on the package while the other comes in a one-pound blank vacuum-sealed package that's then placed inside a printed plastic bag.

There are a few other differences between the original Bright Leaf franks that are likely the most commonly used franks in hot dog stands across the state and this lower-cost version but even the most ardent frank fanatic could easily mix these up.

Unlike the original Bright Leaf dogs these are turkey-based though they do contain some pork and beef as well. At 60 calories and only 4 grams of fat per frank these are a more diet-friendly option. They're far too mild though they do have a semblance of smoke flavor — more so than their smokehouse franks. They're plain but fine.

6. Pender's Red Hots

Around since 1950 Rocky Point's own Pender Packing Company is old-school North Carolina. Their Eastern North Carolina-style pork barbecue is widely available at supermarkets. For a fun time blindfold a friend and tell them you're giving them a bite of a dessert called Pender's Pudding. The look on their face when they taste not chocolate or banana but pork spleens and liver ground into a sausage will be priceless. When they get mad just remind them that it's a good source of iron.

As for the red hots there are (probably) no spleens to be found here. They're a chicken and pork-based sausage with a heat level that's mild but pleasantly lingers. The texture is firmer than some of the other red hots which is a plus. The main ingredient is chicken so it definitely lacks the meatiness of a more pork- or beef-forward dog.

5. Jesse Jones hot dogs

If you've had a hot dog at Martinsville Speedway there's a good chance you had a Jesse Jones dog. The NASCAR track had been serving the Raleigh-based hot dog since 1947. They switched to another brand in 2015 but then brought the Jesse Jones dogs back in 2018 after fan outcry NBC Sports reported.

I can see what all those fans were saying. They're quite salty with an almost bacony flavor. If you've ever been to New Jersey and sampled Taylor ham/pork roll (the debate between those two names is one for a different day) this'll evoke comparisons. These dogs are made with pork and chicken — in that order — but pork is definitely the dominant flavor.

Note that while Jesse Jones is based in Raleigh the package says the hot dogs are made in Ohio.

4. Stevens hot dogs

Hot dogs for $1.39 a package have no business being this good. Like Carolina Packers Stevens is located in Smithfield the capital of hot dogs in North Carolina.

While people online apparently don't like their cooked chitterlings their hot dogs are quite good. They're made with chicken and pork with a deep red color and a stronger meat flavor than one might expect considering the types of meats used. There's some smokiness and salt though not a ton of other spice.

But that's OK! These hot dogs are less than 18 cents each which is both concerning and amazing but let's overlook those concerns and give props to these budget-friendly dogs that are better than some hot dogs that cost triple the price. If you're looking to feed a crowd on a tight budget look no further.

3. Beef Master

You'll never guess what kind of meat these are made from. Interestingly these aggressively masculine hot dogs are made by the Greensboro-based Curtis whose original frank was the blandest of the whole bunch.

Billed as ""the steak eater's frank"" which makes sense and a ""good source of protein for growing families"" which is weird these hot dogs shed their bright red coats in favor of pure unadulterated beef. They should put that on the package instead.

Will you confuse these hot dogs with a steak? No. But these absolutely do pack a punch that make them stand out in a pork and poultry filled hot dog world.

2. Bright Leaf original

Bright Leaf has redeemed itself. In a guide of the best old-school hot dog stands in the state Eater Carolinas said that almost all the dogs served at those iconic joints are these Bright Leaf originals. All those places can't be wrong right?

The dog is not as smoky as the Stevens dog but has a bit more complex spice profile. The ingredient list mentions mustard paprika black pepper onion garlic powder and the proverbial ""spices."" I tasted a bit of clove and nutmeg as well akin to a German-style frank.

Paired with a good firm texture and pleasant snap for a skinless dog and you have yourself a winner.

1. Stevens Red Hots

While Bright Leaf might hold the title of best traditional hot dog there's a new champ in Smithfield and therefore all of North Carolina.

Stevens has been making sausage for more than 60 years. Needham Sloan Stevens Jr. along with his father founded the company after returning to North Carolina after serving in the Army during the Korean War according to his 2013 obituary. The Stevens family has roots in Johnston County that date back to 1742.

Suffice it to say they've had plenty of time to get their recipe right.

These red hots were easily the spiciest of all the dogs in this tasting though not overpoweringly so. There's a smoky flavor in the red hots that pairs well with the heat and keeps the flavor profile from being too one-note.

Texturally these had the firmness and snap I was looking for and couldn't always find — especially with the thicker red hots.

In short it's everything that was good about the Stevens hot dog but better.

Next time I'll put some chili slaw mustard and onion on top and plop it into a soft steamed bun.

A new video emerged showing the moment a Southwest Airlines passenger assaulted a flight attendant.

The flight attendant seen bleeding in the video lost two teeth as a result of the altercation.

The FAA said it's been seeing a spike of aggressive behavior on airlines in recent months.

A new video has emerged of the moment a Southwest Airlines passenger punched a flight attendant in the face knocking two of her teeth out.

The incident occurred on a flight from Sacramento to San Diego on May 23 after a woman identified as 28-year-old Vyvianna Quinonez ""repeatedly ignored standard in-flight instructions and became verbally and physically abusive upon landing"" a spokesperson for the airlines told Insider.

The video shows Quinonez sitting in an aisle seat at the back of the plane jumping up and hitting the flight attendant multiple times as onlookers scream. The 28-year-old keeps swinging until another male passenger intervenes putting himself in between her and the flight attendant.

""Don't you dare touch a flight attendant like that"" the man yells at Quinonez who sits back down. Behind him the shocked flight attendant is seen wiping her face as a streak of blood runs down her cheek.

Watch the moment below:

Upon landing Quinonez was taken into police custody and has been charged with felony battery USA Today reported. A Southwest spokesperson told NBC News Friday that she is banned from ever flying with the airline again.

The flight attendant who has been kept anonymous was taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital for treatment.

""We do not condone or tolerate verbal or physical abuse of our Flight Crews who are responsible for the safety of our passengers"" a Southwest spokesperson told Insider adding that the company is working with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to improve safety measures for flight attendants and passengers.

Earlier this month the FAA said it was seeing a spike of unruly and aggressive behavior on airlines. The agency proposed fines of up to $15000 for five passengers accused of interfering with and assaulting flight attendants.

Southwest Airlines said on Friday it will not resume alcohol services on board until the end of July following the recent surge in in-flight disruptions.







""Given the recent uptick in industry-wide incidents of passenger disruptions inflight we have made the decision to pause the previously announced re-start of alcohol service onboard June (Hawaii flights) and July"" a Southwest spokesman said.

Associated Press

COLLEGE PARK Md. – A retired Southwest Airlines pilot was sentenced to probation Friday after pleading guilty to exposing himself to a female first officer and watching pornography on a laptop during a flight from Philadelphia to Florida last year.

Michael Haak 60 apologized and expressed remorse for his actions before U.S. Magistrate Judge J. Mark Coulson sentenced him to one year of unsupervised probation and a $5000 fine.

“It started as a consensual prank between me and the other pilot. I never imagined it would turn into this in a thousand years” Haak said during a remote hearing.

Federal prosecutors said in a news release that Haak had never met the first officer before that flight bound for Orlando on Aug. 10 2020. After the plane reached its cruising altitude Haak got out of the pilot’s seat “disrobed” and began watching pornographic material on a laptop computer in the cockpit prosecutors said.

“As the plane continued its flight Haak further engaged in inappropriate conduct in the cockpit as the first officer continued to perform her duties as an assigned aircrew member” the statement says.

The first officer submitted a statement to the court but didn’t speak in Friday's hearing. The judge told Haak his actions had a traumatic effect on the co-pilot and could have affected the safety of passengers and other co-workers.

Haak “had a duty to comport himself in a much more responsible manner” Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Cunningham said. “This is not the kind of aberrant behavior that anyone should accept.”

Cunningham said the first officer “unfortunately suffered some consequences” as a result of the incident that Haak “didn’t have anything to do with” but he didn’t elaborate.

“She had a right not to be subjected to this kind of behavior regardless of what may have motivated it or prompted it” the prosecutor said.

Haak was charged in April with intentionally committing a lewd indecent or obscene act in a public place a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of 90 days in jail. He was charged in Maryland because it was one of the states the aircraft crossed that day.

Federal prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence of probation without requiring Haak to register as a sex offender. The judge wasn't bound by that recommendation.

Haak a resident of Longwood Florida was a Southwest Airlines pilot for 27 years until his retirement. His last flight for the Dallas-based airline was on Aug. 31 2020 three weeks after the incident that led to the criminal charge.

Southwest spokesperson Chris Mainz said in a statement that the airline “does not tolerate behavior of this nature and will take prompt action if such conduct is substantiated.” Southwest learned of Haak's behavior only after he voluntarily left the airline according to Mainz.

“Nonetheless Southwest did investigate the matter and as a result ceased paying Mr. Haak any benefits he was entitled to receive as a result of his separation from (the airline)” Mainz said.

Defense attorney Michael Salnick said Haak had a sterling career as a commercial pilot and received numerous accolades and supportive letters from passengers and colleagues including one from Southwest chairman and CEO Gary Kelly on the day of Haak's retirement.

“We are blessed that Southwest has been your home for so many years"" Kelly wrote.

Haak accepts responsibility for his conduct and ""offers no excuses” his lawyer said in a court filing.

Salnick argued that Haak deserves a lenient sentence given his “lifetime of hard work and kindness.”

“The embarrassment and resulting publicity of this incident has in and of itself been humbling to Michael Haak and has served as punishment in many ways” he wrote.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1qb2lucy1zb3V0aHdlc3QtaW4tZXh0ZW5kaW5nLXN1c3BlbnNpb24tb2YtYWxjb2hvbC1zYWxlcy0xMTYyMjQyMzMxONIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RvcnkvYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtam9pbnMtc291dGh3ZXN0LWluLWV4dGVuZGluZy1zdXNwZW5zaW9uLW9mLWFsY29ob2wtc2FsZXMtMTE2MjI0MjMzMTg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines joins Southwest in extending suspension of alcohol sales,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/american-airlines-joins-southwest-in-extending-suspension-of-alcohol-sales-11622423318 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1qb2lucy1zb3V0aHdlc3QtaW4tZXh0ZW5kaW5nLXN1c3BlbnNpb24tb2YtYWxjb2hvbC1zYWxlcy0xMTYyMjQyMzMxONIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RvcnkvYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtam9pbnMtc291dGh3ZXN0LWluLWV4dGVuZGluZy1zdXNwZW5zaW9uLW9mLWFsY29ob2wtc2FsZXMtMTE2MjI0MjMzMTg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL25ld3MtYW5kLXBvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjEvMDUvYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtc291dGh3ZXN0LXBvc3Rwb25lLWFsY29ob2wtc2FsZXMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Southwest postpone serving alcohol amid spike in passenger violence.,"American Airlines and Southwest Airlines have both postponed a plan to resume alcohol sales in their main cabins amid a surge in unruly behavior by passengers that has led to an increase in violence mid-flight. American Airlines announced the decision on Saturday saying it will delay restarting alcohol sales in the main cabin at least until Sept. 13. First and business class passengers will be able to ask for alcohol but only during the flight and not before departure. American announced its decision a day after Southwest had said it was postponing its initial plan to restart alcohol sales next month at least until the end of July.

The airlines took the decision shortly after a video went viral of a woman punching a flight attendant in the face on a Southwest flight from Sacramento to San Diego. The flight attendant lost two teeth. The passenger has been charged with batter causing serious bodily injury and has been banned for life from Southwest. Although more violent than most that altercation illustrates what authorities say is an increase in unruly behavior from passengers this year. “We have just never seen anything like this” Sara Nelson the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants said. “We’ve never seen it so bad.”

Alcohol sales have largely been on pause aboard airplanes as a way to avoid contact between flight attendants and passengers and to help prevent people taking off their masks as much as possible. So far this year airlines filed around 2500 reports of unruly passengers with the Federal Aviation Administration including 1900 that had to do specifically with people refusing to wear face masks. In an internal memo to flight attendants announcing the decision American Airlines said it recognized that “alcohol can contribute to atypical behavior from customers onboard and we owe it to our crew not to potentially exacerbate what can already be a new and stressful situation for our customers.”

Southwest cited the “recent uptick industrywide of incidents in-flight involving disruptive passengers” to explain its decision. “We realize this decision will be disappointing for some customers but we feel it to be the right decision now in the interest of safety and comfort of all onboard” Southwest said in a statement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt1dHYuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLWFtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLXRvLXN1c3BlbmQtYWxjb2hvbC1hZnRlci1mbGlnaHQtYXR0ZW5kYW50LWFzc2F1bHTSAXZodHRwczovL2t1dHYuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3NvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy10by1zdXNwZW5kLWFsY29ob2wtYWZ0ZXItZmxpZ2h0LWF0dGVuZGFudC1hc3NhdWx0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines American Airlines to suspend alcohol after flight attendant assault,"DALLAS (AP) — Over the weekend both Southwest and American Airlines said they would hold off on resuming alcoholic beverage services because of recent incidents of passenger disruption.

The FAA says reports of unruly passenger behavior has been on the rise this year as more travelers return to the skies. According to the agency from Jan. 1 through May 24 there were roughly 2500 reports of unruly behavior by passengers including about 1900 reports of people refusing to comply with the federal mask mandate.

Southwest Airlines is pushing back plans to resume selling alcohol on flights after a recent increase in unruly passengers. The airline planned to start selling booze on some flights next month.

Southwest Airlines last week also banned a woman accused of punching a flight attendant shortly after a plane from Sacramento California landed in San Diego on May 23. The airline said the passenger ignored instructions from the flight attendant before assaulting her. San Diego Harbor Police arrested Vyvianna Quinonez 28 and charged her with felony battery.

But on Friday the airline said it was delaying the move. A Southwest spokesman says the decision might disappoint some customers but is the right decision in the interest of safety. The president of the Southwest flight attendants union has raised concern about selling alcohol again. She says there were 477 incidents of misconduct by passengers on Southwest planes in a recent 5-week period.

Starbucks Japan is usually pretty open about their new and seasonal drink offerings – especially when it’s cherry blossom season – but once in a while they’ll sneak something into their menu without making a fuss about it.

Luckily we have the seasoned eyes of our Japanese-language reporter and Starbucks lover K. Masami to scan the menu for anything new. It was those eyes that recently discovered a new Starbucks Japan and Teavana collaboration item: an Iced Matcha Tea Latte.

▼ There it is subtly squeezed in above the Yuzu Citrus & Tea drink.

Until now the only way to get an iced tea latte at Starbucks Japan was to order an Iced Chai Latte or order a black iced tea with a shot of white mocha syrup and milk (another K. Masami pro tip). Now the Iced Matcha Tea Latte (starting at 440 yen or US$4.02) is joining the family but only from May 26 to August 31.

If you’ve ever made a matcha latte on your own before you might have the same question as K. Masami had when she first read the name: “How do they dissolve the powder?” It takes a lot of skill and hot water to make a matcha latte not taste powdery. Clumps can take away from the whole matcha experience!

▼ Thankfully no clumps that we can see here.

So as they made her drink Masami watched the barista in action. While an iced chai latte just involves mixing the chai base and milk together in a Starbucks cup the Iced Matcha Tea Latte included the extra step of mixing it in the Frappuccino blender.

▼ As you can see the high-speed blending not only created a nice froth but it also thoroughly combined the powder with the latte base.

Masami was pleasantly surprised to find that it tasted deliciously unique from the hot Matcha Tea Latte. The cold temperature made it taste more matcha-y than its warmer counterpart yet it was less sweet as well. It had a smooth mouthfeel that was the perfect balance of bitter and sweet and its aftertaste was refreshing.

▼ Overall Masami could picture making this a daily go-to.

If you’re going to try the Iced Matcha Tea Latte before it (sadly) goes off the menu she recommends getting a Tall size or larger. You’re going to want it according to her since it’s so refreshing to drink on especially warm days. Now if only they’d bring back the Chocolate Brownie Matcha Frappuccino as well…

UNIVERSITY HEIGHTS The Bronx (WABC) -- Family and friends paid their respects to the Bronx woman who died in a horrific crash on the Deegan last week. The driver also didn't make it.

Police say the driver of the car was speeding but one of the victims says the truck it slammed into did not have the collision guards that could have lessened the crash.

Daybelis Lantigua was the apple of her family's eye and was just two days shy of her 23rd birthday when she died last week. On Saturday with heavy hearts family and friends came to pay their respects to this once vibrant girl.

""I don't feel like she's gone"" said friend Jacob Matos.

'Day' as her friends call her had just graduated with an MBA and was working at Starbucks in Hartsdale - she was living the dream.

That dream came to a crashing end last Friday morning when the BMW she was a passenger in slammed into a semi on the Deegan lodging the car firmly underneath the truck.

The driver of the car was George Tyras 24. His grieving brother told Eyewitness News 'he was a loving kid always had a smile always wanted to see everybody happy.'

Police say Tyras was driving his BMW M3 at a high rate of speed.

""This was a completely needless fatality it shouldn't have happened"" said Lantigua family attorney William H. Grae.

The attorney is now putting the blame on the tractor-trailer saying it did not have the proper safety equipment to stop the car from hitting it so forcefully.

Police say the truck driver did remain on the scene. He was not hurt.

There are no arrests in the case and the investigation is ongoing.

Eyewitness News reached out to the trucking company but has not yet heard back.

Lansing Township Police said on Friday Brett Donald Fellows 30 is accused of committing ""more than one sexual assault"" between January and February this year with the teen.

In a news release township police said they received a referral from Child Protective Services on Feb. 28 2021 regarding sexual assault involving an adult male employee of St. Vincent Home at 2828 W. Willow St. and ""a 16-year-old female protected party placed at the facility.""

On Thursday township police presented their investigation to the Ingham County Prosecutor's Office which issued an arrest warrant for Fellows' on three counts of third-degree criminal sexual conduct in foster care. 55th District Court Magistrate Stefani Godsey authorized Fellows' arrest warrant Thursday.

Lansing Township Police Chief John Joseph confirmed Fellows was fired from the group home after police received the Child Protective Services referral. St. Vincent spokesperson Andrea Bitely confirmed Fellows was terminated on March 1 and the organization is cooperating with law enforcement on the investigation.

""These alleged actions are completely contrary to our mission; STVCC exists to protect and care for children in crisis"" she said in an emailed statement. The statement said the organization recognizes the case could cause ""a negative ripple effect that will impact the Children’s Home many years to come.""

St. Vincent Catholic Charities suspended operations at its children's home the first week of May citing challenges with staffing. At that time officials said leaders at St. Vincent had determined ""a temporary pause in programming is necessary to properly provide the highest quality of care the best and safest environment and the right forms of management for both the children and their staff.""

The home accepts children aged 5 to 17 who suffer from abuse and neglect with typically 90% of the children being wards of the court. Children at the home receive counseling education and other social services.

Operations suspended: St. Vincent Catholic Charities suspends children's home operations amid staffing licensing issues

State records indicated the home has a compacity of 40 children and was operating on a provisional license expiring in September. Discussions are ongoing with the state Department of Health and Human Services on their licenses.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with all children who are victims of crimes"" Bitely concluded in the statement.

Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Research Officer and economist Subhayu Bandyopadhyay and Research Associate Praew Grittayaphong explored this question in the Regional Economist article “Educational Attainment of Immigrants at the National and Eighth District Levels.” In it they reasoned that immigrants with higher educational levels are more likely to earn more—and pay more in taxes—while being less likely to become a fiscal burden.

The authors analyzed the foreign-born population in the U.S. and compared it with the native-born population. They looked at the data for the nation the states of the Eighth Federal Reserve District and the District’s four largest metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs): Little Rock Ark.; Louisville Ky.; Memphis Tenn.; and St. Louis.

Educational Attainment

In the figure below the first four sets of bars show striking differences in the education of U.S. natives and immigrants. At the national and District levels the shares of foreign-born people without a high school degree are much larger. Among those with high school degrees the native shares are much greater than those of the foreign born.

SOURCE: 2018 American Community Survey accessed via IPUMS USA.

The age makeup of the native-born population differs sharply from that of the foreign born because most people who migrate internationally are of working age.

“The same age distribution trend is reflected in our data” the authors wrote. “While around 30% of the U.S. native-born population is younger than 22 only about 10% of the foreign-born population is in the same age group. To account for this our calculations include only individuals who are 22 years old or older.”

What’s in the Data

For the U.S. the differences between the “no high school” and “high school” categories of natives and immigrants largely offset each other according to the authors. Meanwhile educational attainment above a high school degree for immigrants and natives is similar at around 32%. But slightly higher proportions of the foreign born hold graduate degrees nationwide and in District states.

The data also suggest that the proportion of the foreign born at the lowest educational level is relatively high likely lowering their average income compared with that of the native born they added.

“This is perhaps why we find that at the national level the native-born population earns a much higher median personal income ($30000) relative to that of the foreign-born ($24500)” the authors wrote. “This difference persists albeit at a lower magnitude in the District.”

MSA-Level Findings

The table below focuses on the four largest Eighth District MSAs and the Chicago MSA which is outside the District. (Chicago is included to serve as an external frame of reference.)

Highest Educational Attainment and Median Income Level by District MSA Highest Educational Attainment Median Personal Income No High School Degree High School Degree Bachelor's Degree Graduate Degree Native-Born Foreign-Born Native-Born Foreign-Born Native-Born Foreign-Born Native-Born Foreign-Born Native-Born Foreign-Born Chicago 6% 25% 53% 43% 25% 19% 15% 13% $35000 $26000 Little Rock 8% 19% 61% 50% 19% 15% 11% 15% $30000 $22000 Louisville 9% 23% 61% 40% 19% 20% 11% 17% $30100 $25000 Memphis 10% 30% 62% 33% 18% 20% 10% 18% $26100 $23300 St. Louis 8% 10% 59% 38% 20% 27% 13% 24% $32000 $32000 SOURCE: 2018 American Community Survey accessed via IPUMS USA.

Compared with the foreign-born population a higher share of U.S. natives in the Eighth District have attained at least a high school diploma. But in the St. Louis MSA the proportion of the foreign born without a high school diploma is similar to that of natives.

The St. Louis MSA is unique because it’s the only MSA in the table that shows the foreign born earning just as much as U.S. natives. The foreign born in the St. Louis MSA also have the highest median personal income among all the foreign-born populations shown in the table they pointed out.

“While the Eighth District largely mirrors the nation important differences are visible at the more granular level of District MSAs most notably in the St. Louis MSA where immigrants display relatively high educational attainment and income levels” the authors wrote.

Equal1 is developing a new type of quantum computer based on a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)

Irish quantum computing hardware start-up Equal1.Labs could raise up to $50m (€41m) in the next number of years.

Equal1 has appointed Declan O’Mahoney as its new chairman. O’Mahoney is currently a senior partner at company advisor Maywentee and was previously a non-executive director at Voxpro and CEO of HeartSine Technologies which sold to US pharma giant Stryker.

O’Mahoney said the company was now looking to build on its successes.

“I think it has a great opportunity to leap ahead of a lot of the demands here for artificial intelligence [AI] and quantum computing” he said.

“I got involved through my relationships with Atlantic Bridge [an investor in Equal1] and my relationship with Jason [Lynch COO at Equal1]. I am now stepping in as chairman to work with the guys and help them build out the business a bit.”

O’Mahoney said Equal1 would constantly be raising capital as it looks to expand.

“We are always raising money” he said. “This is a big bet. These quantum computing businesses are attracting massive amounts of investment.

""This company will probably raise somewhere between $20m and $50m in the next number of years. There’s going to be constant investment in this kind of technology.”

Despite its ambitious funding aims Equal1 does not have immediate plans to launch a series-A round as it is “pretty well-funded at this point” said O’Mahoney. It has raised around $5m with $8m in total going into the business before the end of the year.

Equal1 which has around 13 employees in Ireland is developing a new type of quantum computer based on CMOS – a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor.

Unlike current quantum computers which require very high costs to operate quantum bits frozen at a temperature of 15mK (-273°C) the Equal1 quantum processing unit can operate at higher temperatures significantly reducing its size.

The firm which has a site in the US was founded by Dr Dirk Leipold Dr George Maxim Mike Asker and Professor R Bogdan Staszewski and is a spin-out from the UCD School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Atlantic Bridge invested in Equal1 through the University Bridge Fund to support the fabrication of its first quantum processor chip

Atlantic Bridge has invested in Equal1 through the University Bridge Fund to support the fabrication of the company’s first quantum processor chip.

“We have a technology that will enable quantum computing in a very simple fashion” said O’Mahoney. “We are very excited about that.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

From the moment you sign in to your Gmail account to accessing your financial details via PayPal 2FA is there to greet you as a more secure way of logging in. You’ll even find it when setting up a PS5 or Xbox Series X . Heck chances are you’ve already used to today.



Also known as multi-factor authentication 2FA is an extra layer of security — used by virtually every online platform — that stops many low-level hackers in their tracks protecting all your valuable private information from being breached.

Alas hacking tactics are forever evolving and all it takes is one crafty cybercriminal to find a tiny hole in the armor and plunder what were once impenetrable accounts to their heart’s content. But you don’t have to be a whizz at decrypting code to gain access to an unsuspecting victim’s account.



In fact according to the 2021 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report  61% of the 5250 confirmed security breaches the American network operator analyzed involved stolen credentials. Of course multi-factor authentication’s purpose is to prevent malicious actors from gaining access to an account even if they discover a super-secret password.

But much like how Scar left Mufasa to fall to his doom in one of the greatest betrayals of all time the security method can also be the root cause of cybercriminal activity. The real traitor? Your old phone number.



For a better sense of how attackers can easily use two-factor authentication against you it’s best to know what the online security method is and how it works. If it helps think of your old phone number as Scar throughout this piece.

What is two-factor authentication?

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a digital authentication method used to confirm the identity of a user to allow them access to a website or app through at least two pieces of evidence. Two-factor authentication more popularly known as 2FA is the most commonly used method.



In order for 2FA to work a user must have at least two important pieces of credentials in order to log in to an account (with multi-factor usually involving more than three different details). This means if an unauthorized user gets their hands on a password they will still need access to an email or phone number linked to the account where a special code is sent for an extra level of protection.



For example a bank will require a username and password in order for a user to access their account but it also needs a second form of authentication such as a unique code or fingerprint recognition to confirm a user’s identity. This second factor can also be used before a transaction is made.



As explained by software company Ping Identity 2FA’s required credentials are split into three different categories: “what you know” “what you have” and “what you are.” In terms of “what you know” or your knowledge this comes down to your passwords PIN number or answer to a security question such as “what is your mother’s maiden name?” (something I never seem to remember).

“What you are” is arguably the most secure category as it confirms your identity from a physical trait unique only to you. This is usually seen on smartphones  such as an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy phone using biometric authentication such as a fingerprint or facial scan to gain access.



As for “what you have” this refers to what is in your possession which can be anything from a smart device to a smartcard. Generally this method means getting a pop-up notification on your phone via SMS that needs to be confirmed before gaining access to an account. For any professionals using Google Gmail for business you’ll have come across this category.



Unfortunately that last category is cause for concern especially when you throw phone number recycling into the mix.

Phone number recycling

According to the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) more than 35 million numbers in the U.S. are disconnected and become available again by reassigning them to a new subscriber every year. Sure numbers are infinite and all but there are only so many 10 or 11-digit combinations a mobile network can offer its customers.



(Image credit: T-Mobile)

The U.K.’s Office of Communications (Ofcom) the entity that assigns mobile numbers to U.K. network providers states (via The Evening Standard ) that it has a strict “use it or lose it” policy for pay-as-you-go mobile numbers. Vodafone disconnects and recycles a phone number after just 90 days of no activity while O2 does this after 12 months.



In the U.S. network providers including Verizon and T-Mobile let customers change and choose the available numbers shown on online number change interfaces via their website or app. There are millions of recycled phone numbers available with more piling up each day.



Recycled numbers can be harmful to those who originally owned them as many platforms including Gmail and Facebook are linked to your mobile number for password recovery or and here’s the kicker two-factor authentication.

How 2FA puts you at risk

A study at Princeton University discovered how easily anyone can obtain a recycled phone number and use it for several common cyberattacks including account takeovers and even denying access to an account by holding it hostage and asking for a ransom in exchange for access.

(Image credit: Princeton University)

According to the study an attacker can find available numbers and check if any of them are associated with online accounts from previous owners. By viewing their online profiles and checking to see if their old number is linked attackers can buy the recycled number (just $15 at T-Mobile) and reset the password on the accounts. Using 2FA they will then receive and enter the special code sent via SMS.



The researchers tested 259 numbers they obtained through the two U.S. mobile carriers and found that 171 of them had a linked account on at least one of six commonly used websites: Amazon AOL Facebook Google PayPal and Yahoo. This is called a “reverse lookup attack.”

Researchers found another variation of the attack that allowed malicious actors to hijack accounts without having to reset a password. Using online people search service BeenVerified  a hacker could search for an email address by using a recycled phone number then check if the email addresses had been involved in data breaches using Have I Been Pwned? . If they had the attacker could buy the password on a cybercriminal black market and break into a 2FA-enabled account without needing to reset a password.

To make matters worse attackers can also take your account hostage. A nasty trick sees a hacker obtain a number to sign up to several online services that require a phone number. Once complete they discontinue the service so the number can be recycled for a new subscriber to start using. When the new user tries to sign up for the same services the hacker will be notified via 2FA and deny them a way to use the service. The threat actor will then ask for the victim to pay a ransom if they want to use these online services.



Using 2FA in this way is atrocious but that doesn’t stop it from happening. T-Mobile reviewed the research back in December and now reminds subscribers to update their contact number on bank accounts and social media profiles on its number change support page . But that’s all the carrier has the power to do meaning those not informed will be open to attacks.

Alternate ways to use 2FA

If anything phone numbers and 2FA don’t gel very well. The good news however is that there are now more options available when opting to use 2FA including the aforementioned biometric methods or authenticator apps.

However these options aren’t always available and sometimes online services only provide you two options for 2FA: your phone number or your email address. If you don’t want hackers rummaging through your private information it’s best to opt for email authentication. Of course there are those who don’t always use their emails and with time can often forget their passwords. No password means no way of obtaining an authentication code.



To solve this it’s best to find a password manager. LastPass used to be the go-to for years thanks to its free-tier service but there are other contenders worth checking out.



“But what if I’m already using my phone number for 2FA?” I hear you ask. If you’re considering changing your phone number make sure to unlink your phone number from the online services it is connected to before making the switch. And if you have already made the switch it is well worth your time updating your accounts to get rid of any Scars (phone numbers) lying in wait to backstab you when you least expect it.



Outlook",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMjQ1ODYyOS96dGUtYXhvbi0zMC11bHRyYS1yZXZpZXctc2NyZWVuLXByaWNlLXNwZWNz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ZTE Axon 30 Ultra review: the right stuff for the right price,"The ZTE Axon 30 Ultra is a high-end device that checks all the right hardware boxes. Snapdragon 888 processor? Check. Fast refresh rate screen? Check. A metric ton of rear-facing cameras? Check check check and check. It’s also priced well starting at $749 while many of its competitors start around the $1000 mark.

The Axon 30 Ultra delivers on many fronts like its high-quality screen and flagship-level performance. For some that will be enough. However it falls short in more subtle ways that you won’t see on a spec sheet. Its novel camera array is let down by uneven heavy-handed processing. There’s also a stray bug here and there which can range from harmless (a 5G on / off toggle appears twice in a quick settings menu) to more annoying (the camera shutter noise going off even in silent mode). ZTE may iron out these bugs in future updates or they won’t and you’ll be the obnoxious parent with the noisy smartphone camera during your child’s dance recital.

the Axon 30 Ultra offers top-notch performance with a large lovely screen

And even though all of the key hardware is there a few flagship-y features have been omitted to hit the Axon 30 Ultra’s more aggressive price point. There’s no IP rating for water resistance and no wireless charging. The phone doesn’t work on Verizon either just on T-Mobile and AT&T and 5G service on T-Mobile is limited to one band.

If those factors aren’t dealbreakers and you’re comfortable working around the occasional quirk then the Axon 30 Ultra offers top-notch performance with a large lovely screen at a lower price than the competition. We don’t see too many of those high-performance / lower cost premium phones in the US to challenge the heavyweights of the Android world and it’s nice to have an alternative. But it does lack some of the polish and a few features that distinguish the more expensive competition.

The 30 Ultra’s screen is curved on the edges for a more immersive feel.

ZTE Axon 30 Ultra screen battery and performance

At 6.7 inches the Axon 30 Ultra’s screen is about as big as they come these days. It’s a 1080p OLED with a refresh rate up to 144Hz. You can set it manually to 60 90 120 or 144Hz or let it switch automatically between those rates based on the content you’re viewing. That 144Hz rate is a little faster than the 120Hz rate you’ll find on most high-end devices but I’m not sure I could tell the difference between them if I didn’t know which was which. The bottom line is that every swipe scroll and animation looks incredibly smooth on the 30 Ultra’s screen.

Generally speaking it’s just a really nice screen. Contrast is rich the bezels are slim and the panel curves over the sides of the phone; marketers love to call a screen like this “immersive” but that actually feels like a fair descriptor. It’s a little tough to see outside in bright light but it’s still usable.

That big screen makes the Axon 30 Ultra a big device. It’s comfortable enough to hold and the curved screen and back panel help but I definitely can’t reach my thumb clear across the screen while using it one-handed. There’s Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back panels and the frame is aluminum giving the whole phone a solid premium feel.

The Axon 30 Ultra offers Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back panel.

Phone performance also meets the “premium” bar thanks to that Snapdragon 888 processor. It feels very snappy jumping between apps pinching and zooming around Google Maps and scrolling through Twitter. I’m also happy to report that the in-screen optical fingerprint sensor is quick and responsive too — it gave me a little thrill with every unlock and password manager authentication. It’s a feature that goes the extra distance to making this feel like a highly responsive premium device.

The Axon 30 Ultra’s 4600mAh battery is big enough and consistently got me through a day of moderate use. However I was conservative with some battery-draining settings like screen refresh rate and all of my use was on Wi-Fi so I expect you could fully drain the battery over the course of a day if you really went for it. Wireless charging is as mentioned earlier not an option here but the phone supports 65W wired charging with the included charging brick and it is plenty fast.

Android 11 comes preloaded on the Axon 30 Ultra and ZTE says an Android 12 update will come at the end of the year or in early 2022. The company doesn’t give a firm timeline for security updates but says it generally provides them for around three years. Not the worst support policy by far but not among the very best. ZTE’s Android interface is called MyOS and it’s a straightforward affair that doesn’t try to get too fancy. There are a truly overwhelming number of shortcuts in the fully expanded quick settings menu accessed by swiping from the top of the screen but you can rearrange and whittle them down to your heart’s content.

Cameras galore.

ZTE Axon 30 Ultra cameras

Rather than one high-resolution main camera complemented by several lower-resolution sensors ZTE has chosen to put three 64-megapixel sensors in the Axon 30 Ultra’s rear camera array. You’ll find a standard wide-angle main camera with optical stabilization a 35mm-equivalent wide-angle for portraits and an ultrawide. There’s also an 8-megapixel 5x telephoto camera with optical stabilization. It’s a lot of cameras and none of them are throwaways.

The Axon 30 Ultra’s cameras are impressive but they’re also a little frustrating. First the good: these three 64-megapixel cameras all capture a lot of detail in good light which I’d expect from the main camera but that isn’t always the case with ultrawides since they tend to have lower resolution chips. The telephoto module offers 5x true optical zoom — results aren’t great indoors or in dim light but with plenty of available light it’s much better than the digital zoom alternative.

I also really like the portrait lens which is wider than the telephoto options most other smartphone cameras use. This is a personal preference; I like getting more of the scene in portrait photos you may not. There’s no option to digitally zoom in while using portrait mode if you don’t like the wide-angle look and portrait mode photos (with artificially blurred backgrounds) can only be taken with the dedicated portrait lens or the selfie camera. Something to consider if wide portraits are really not your thing.

Now the bad: image processing (particularly color and saturation) is inconsistent between cameras and two photos from the same camera can vary noticeably with slight shifts in composition or subject positioning. Images from the main camera often look oversaturated. Most of the time it’s subtle enough not to bother me much but then I’ll take a picture of my orange cat and he’ll look like a Cheeto.

Portrait mode photos suffer some misses too: subject separation from blurred backgrounds can look a little clumsy and the lack of OIS in the portrait camera means you’re more likely to see slight blur in dimmer conditions even without much camera movement. The wider focal length also means you’ll need to crank up the blur if you want to obscure a distracting background which makes the subject cut-out problems more obvious.

when the Axon 30 Ultra does get things right images look really good

Maybe these shortcomings are more frustrating because when the Axon 30 Ultra does get things right images look really good. Exposure is well balanced all four cameras are genuinely useful and each of them offers an impressive level of detail retention. I’d entertain leaving my dedicated camera at home more often with this combination of focal lengths and capabilities but image processing is too much of a wild card for me to feel comfortable with that.

One of the Axon 30 Ultra’s most annoying bugs lives in the camera app too: the camera shutter sound is permanently stuck on even with every volume control set to silent. There’s no way to turn it off in the camera settings menu or the main settings menu. I hate this. Maybe some people could live with it. Maybe you can root your phone and eliminate the problem yourself. Maybe ZTE will fix the issue soon. All I know is that I cannot live a shutter-sound-on lifestyle and it’s the kind of thing I might return a phone over no matter how good the pictures look.

The Axon 30 Ultra is missing a few flagship-y features like wireless charging but it doesn’t skimp on build quality.

The ZTE Axon 30 Ultra is exactly what it appears to be: a lower cost alternative to the big Android flagships with top-tier performance and a great screen. I wouldn’t recommend it to just anyone and you need to be comfortable either living with a couple of quirks or navigating a way around them. You don’t quite get the same level of polish or reassurance that you would from a Samsung OnePlus or Google device but in return you get excellent performance for the money.

The Axon 30 Ultra has a healthy price advantage over the other big-screen-big-performance competition like the $1069 OnePlus 9 Pro and the $999 Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus. If you’re willing to concede some screen real estate then its advantage narrows compared to the OnePlus 9 ($729) and standard Galaxy S21 ($800). With either of those options you’ll get the same excellent performance and a few other benefits like wireless charging and more sophisticated image processing.

The Axon 30 Ultra has a healthy price advantage over the other big-screen-big-performance competition

Of course it’s an important caveat that the Axon 30 Ultra doesn’t work on Verizon. That will rule out a significant number of prospective customers in the US. And I wish the cameras lived up to their hardware potential more often. If that’s not much of a concern you’re not a Verizon customer and your priorities are set on a big screen and snappy day-to-day performance then you have a great option in the 30 Ultra.

All that said I can’t see a reason not to buy the Axon 30 Ultra if none of the above concerns you. You’ll get excellent performance a massive screen with a silky smooth fast refresh rate and great camera hardware — and you can rub it in your friends’ faces when you pay several hundred dollars less for your phone than they did.

There are basically three main reasons for this. This includes limited spectrum resources available for 5G networks the cumbersome deployment of 5G network equipment and the lack of killer applications for 5G services. The media often use words such as “fast” to describe 5G speed. However the speed of 5G wireless network deployment in the United States has nothing to do with the speed.

In the past three years the prospect of 5G wireless networks has been the focus of major media reports. Nevertheless most Americans have not felt 5G that can truly achieve the desired effect. Although all major wireless operators in the United States have stated that their 5G services have covered the entire United States industry analysts said that this so-called 5G service is not much different from 4G. According to market research firm Evercore ISI most Americans may not be able to enjoy 5G services that are significantly faster than current wireless communication networks until later this year at the earliest.

James Ratcliffe an analyst at Evercore ISI said: “In general it is expected that sometime between the end of 2021 and the end of 2023 truly better 5G services will cover two-thirds of the U.S. population”.

Why is 5G deployment in the U.S. slow?

Analysts academics and former industry executives said that a combination of multiple factors has led to the relatively slow deployment of 5G networks in the United States.

Some of these issues involve network infrastructure and limited radio frequency bands that can take into account high-speed network transmission and signal coverage. Moreover new network equipment needs to be put on the shelves to deploy 5G networks which is relatively cumbersome. In addition many new equipments are not produced in the United States. This means that it takes longer to purchase equipments.

1. Limited Band

Currently 5G networks mainly transmit data through low-band mid-band and high-band radio waves. High-frequency radio waves also known as millimeter waves have the highest data transmission speed and the largest bandwidth. However its coverage is the smallest. Low-frequency radio waves have wider coverage but the transmission speed is the slowest. The mid-band radio waves are considered to be able to take into account coverage and transmission speed.

Companies such as Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile have stated that the 5G networks they have deployed have now covered more than 200 million Americans. They claim that their coverage is enough to meet the needs of the United States. However most of these networks rely on low-band radio waves. This means that they have a limited transmission speed.

Wireless operators are now focusing on grabbing mid-frequency bands and have invested a lot of money in recent bids for mid-frequency band resources.

But the main problem facing these companies is that most of the mid-frequency bands are currently occupied by US government agencies and other agencies mainly for military communications meteorological services and so on. So far wireless operators can only use a small portion of the IF frequency band resources.

U.S. government agencies are also aware of the lack of IF frequency band resources. Earlier this year the United States auctioned a total of $81 billion of mid-frequency band licenses and plans to hold another auction this fall.

2. Lack of killer applications

Brian Kelley associate professor of electrical engineering at the University of Texas at San Antonio believes the lack of killer applications is another major factor hindering the deployment of 5G networks.

“It can be said that this is the single biggest factor that can stimulate the speed of deployment” said Kelly who worked as an engineer at Motorola.

Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson a telecom industry research company said that the three major advantages of 5G networks are that it has faster data transmission speeds (100 times faster than 4G) supports a large number of concurrent connections and can significantly improve the speed of response between connected devices.

Moffett said: “There is no single revenue model that can be associated with these three advantages…It is not even clear whether consumers are willing to pay more for downloading videos faster”.

Moffett said that since 5G networks can seamlessly connect sensors and other IoT devices companies are likely to be the first users of 5G services.

The use of 5G services by enterprises may appear in the form of deploying private 5G networks. He said that 5G networks “can be regarded as the next generation of Wi-Fi wireless networks that are faster and more secure and can connect more devices.”

But Moffett said the question is “Will wireless operators build private 5G networks used by enterprises?”

He said this is very important because if companies choose to deploy private 5G networks on their own wireless operators may lose related revenue and cannot invest more in 5G infrastructure construction.

3. Equipment problem

Ideally 5G networks are very different from 4G partly because 5G networks need to transmit data in higher frequency bands. This means that upgrading 5G networks requires different technologies and equipment. Installing new equipment may require finding a suitable location and obtaining proper permits. In some cases it will require digging roads to lay fiber optic cables. This will enable the transmission of data at high speeds between base stations.

Edward Gazzola chief executive of the Atlanta-based infrastructure company Bennett & Pless said that it is expected that by 2022 the massive construction work required for wireless communication networks to reach 5G network standards will increase.

He said that the pandemic and technical obstacles have caused continuous delays in progress. For example wireless operators need to wait for the latest engineering standards to arrive before purchasing new equipment.

Equipment availability is also a common problem for wireless operators. Today there are only five major companies in the global network equipment supplier market. These companies are Nokia Ericsson Samsung ZTE and Huawei.

Two are in China. One is in Finland one is in Sweden and one is in South Korea. All these suppliers are outside the U.S. and this is a problem. To make matters worse 5G network equipment requires computer chips. The chip industry has recently been struggling to cope with the shortage of supply. This is further compounding the issues of the U.S.

Conclusion

The limited band lack of killer apps and equipment issues are technically unsolvable for the U.S. presently. The U.S. government is already using the feasible faster bands. Although it is trying to sell some it can only do so much. If the speed of 5G in the U.S. does not significantly increase the application of this network can not commence. Out of the five major equipment suppliers globally the U.S. is at loggerheads with Huawei and ZTE. Relying on Ericsson Nokia and Samsung is a major setback for the U.S. It is even more difficult considering that none of these companies are American.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9nb2xkZW5rbmlnaHRzL2dvbGRlbi1rbmlnaHRzLXdpbGwtcmV0dXJuLXRvLWZ1bGwtY2FwYWNpdHktYXQtdC1tb2JpbGUtYXJlbmEtMjM2NjQ5Ny_SAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvZ29sZGVua25pZ2h0cy9nb2xkZW4ta25pZ2h0cy13aWxsLXJldHVybi10by1mdWxsLWNhcGFjaXR5LWF0LXQtbW9iaWxlLWFyZW5hLTIzNjY0OTcvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Golden Knights will return to full capacity at T-Mobile Arena,"The Golden Knights will have “100 percent capacity and beyond” starting with Game 3 of their series against the Colorado Avalanche general manager Kelly McCrimmon said.

T-Mobile Arena will be full for the first time this season in the second round of the NHL playoffs.

The Golden Knights will have “100 percent capacity and beyond” at their home rink starting with Game 3 of the West Division final playoff series general manager Kelly McCrimmon said Saturday.

The NHL has not announced the full schedule for the best-of-seven series against the Colorado Avalanche.

“That’s going to be really great for our fans and be great for the atmosphere in the building and for our team” McCrimmon said.

The Knights have not announced whether fans will be required to wear masks to games. The NHL on Friday announced that starting in the second round there no longer will be a requirement for guests over age 2 to wear a face covering while in the arena subject to local guidelines.

The Knights had 12156 fans for their Game 7 victory over the Minnesota Wild on Friday approximately 70 percent of capacity. They haven’t had a full building since a March 3 2020 win over the New Jersey Devils.

“The crowd’s always good” left wing William Carrier said before Game 7. “We’ve played a lot of games in the playoffs and they’re great for us.”

Knights reach vaccination threshold

McCrimmon said Saturday the Knights are considered a vaccinated team because more than 85 percent of their travel party is fully vaccinated allowing them to have looser restrictions.

The team still had numerous COVID-19 scares in the first round despite that. McCrimmon said five players and four staff members tested positive between Games 2 and 3 against Minnesota but they were determined to be false positives.

Defenseman Brayden McNabb went into the NHL’s COVID-19 protocols between Games 5 and 6 and McCrimmon said he tested positive. Right wing Ryan Reaves and rookie forward Peyton Krebs went into the protocols a day later but were cleared within 24 hours.

McCrimmon said Reaves had a false positive and Krebs was considered a close contact of Reaves. Reaves didn’t play in Game 6 against the Wild.

“It’s concerning but it’s the process the National Hockey League used and the exact same process the National Football League used and I guess it’s just the realities of mass testing on a daily basis that these things are going to happen” McCrimmon said. “It doesn’t make it any less unsettling when it does happen and you desperately hope you wouldn’t have a player miss a game and be unavailable to play because of a false positive.”

Krebs update

McCrimmon didn’t rule out Krebs who fractured his jaw in his fourth NHL game and had surgery for the rest of the season.

Krebs 20 was the Knights’ first-round pick in 2019 and had an assist in his debut. McCrimmon said the team initially thought he would be out “very long term” but the prognosis now appears to be more optimistic.

“He’s not available to play but I do believe his timeline is quite a bit shorter than what we anticipated initially” McCrimmon said. “We’re hopeful if we can keep playing that he’s a player that would be available for selection by the coaching staff.”

Some laws are changing that,"CNN —

Politicians like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and others shouldn’t liken contemporary events to the Holocaust because such comparisons cheapen the horrific magnitude of the genocide of 6 million Jews historians and advocacy groups say.

“The Holocaust was a unique event in human history encompassing evils so great it is nearly indescribable” said Amy Lutz a spokesperson for the St. Louis Kaplan Feldman Holocaust Museum. “Contemporary comparisons to the Holocaust as a whole are inappropriate and should have no place in our public discourse.”

Last week Greene compared House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to continue to require members of the House to wear masks on the chamber floor to steps Nazis took to control the Jewish population during the Holocaust. Her comments were swiftly condemned.

But Greene is far from the first public official to wade into controversy over comments referencing the Holocaust. An Alaska state lawmaker and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have also gotten into hot water over Holocaust comparisons.

Conservatives attacked Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in 2019 after she accused President Trump's administration of running ""concentration camps"" in detaining migrants at the southern border.

Anti-vaccination and anti-lockdown protesters in arguing about infringements on civil liberties have made similar comments during the pandemic. And with a recent uptick in anti-Semitic incidents in the US amid tensions over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict Jewish advocacy groups and Holocaust museums are speaking out against the dangers of such analogies.

Some officials are calling for more education about the Holocaust to counter misinformation and promote understanding.

Nineteen US states require Holocaust education as part of the public school curriculum said Andy Hollinger a spokesperson for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. That includes Arkansas which passed a bill last month requiring educators to teach Holocaust history in schools beginning in 2022.

But 31 states do not. Holocaust awareness advocates would like to change that.

Holocaust analogies have become so common there’s a word for them

Comparisons to the Holocaust the systemic extermination of millions of Jews by Nazi Germany during World War II have long been frowned upon. Some historians and Jewish advocacy groups argue that the sheer scale and magnitude of the Holocaust cannot be likened to anything today.

The Auschwitz Memorial which runs a museum at the site of the former Nazi concentration camp responded to Greene’s comments by saying that citing the Holocaust in a debate about public health “is a sad symptom of moral and intellectual decline.”

Holocaust analogies demonize demean and intimidate their targets said Edna Friedberg a historian at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. While it’s not a new trend it’s escalating and turning the Holocaust into “the epithet to end all epithets” she said.

“Nazis seem to be everywhere these days. I don’t mean self-proclaimed neo-Nazis. I’m talking about folks being labeled as Nazis Hitler Gestapo Goering — take your pick — by their political opponents” Friedberg wrote in a 2019 essay titled “Why Holocaust Analogies are Dangerous.”

“American politicians from across the ideological spectrum influential media figures and ordinary people on social media casually use Holocaust terminology to bash anyone or any policy with which they disagree. The takedown is so common that it’s even earned its own term reductio ad Hitlerum.”

Reductio ad Hitlerum a variation on a phrase in Latin means invalidating someone else’s position and dismissing it as similar to views held by Adolf Hitler or the Nazi Party. In short playing the Nazi card.

“At a time when our country needs dialogue more than ever it is especially dangerous to exploit the memory of the Holocaust as a rhetorical cudgel” Friedberg wrote. “We owe the survivors more than that. And we owe ourselves more than that.”

More than half of American adults don’t know how many people died in the Holocaust

Recent studies have highlighted the need for more education in the US about the Holocaust.

A 2020 study by the Pew Research Center found more than half of Americans didn’t know that 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust. Most adults know what the Holocaust was and when it happened but only 45% got the number of victims right according to the Pew survey.

“This raises an important question: Are those who underestimate the death toll simply uninformed or are they Holocaust deniers – people with anti-Semitic views who claim that the Holocaust was invented or exaggerated by Jews as part of a plot to advance Jewish interests?” the Pew survey asked.

A similar US study last year by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany a group which seeks restitution for victims of Nazi persecution and their heirs found a similar lack of Holocaust knowledge.

At least 63% of those surveyed didn’t know that 6 million Jews were killed and 36% thought the death toll was under 2 million the study found.

“The results are both shocking and saddening and they underscore why we must act now while Holocaust survivors are still with us to voice their stories” said Gideon Taylor president of the Claims Conference as the group is informally known in a statement.

In one of the survey’s more disturbing findings 11% of millennial and Gen Z respondents said they believe Jews caused the Holocaust.

“We need to understand why we aren’t doing better in educating a younger generation about the Holocaust and the lessons of the past” Taylor added. “This needs to serve as a wake-up call to us all and as a road map of where government officials need to act.”

To help combat these misunderstandings the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum will mount a traveling exhibition “Americans and the Holocaust” at public and university libraries across the country through 2023.

“Teaching about the Holocaust and its timeless lessons including the dangers of unchecked antisemitism is the foundation of all of our work” Hollinger said. “We offer free education resources and training for educators. Our online Holocaust Encyclopedia the definitive digital resource on the Holocaust is available in 19 languages.”

The St. Louis Kaplan Feldman Holocaust Museum also provides workshops on the Holocaust for educators and police officers.

Some states are requiring schools to teach about the Holocaust

To ensure students learn about the Holocaust some states are taking action.

Massachusetts lawmakers are pushing for mandatory education on the Holocaust and other genocides after a high school football coach was fired for allegedly using anti-Semitic language for play calls.

In the Claims Conference study Wisconsin had the highest score in Holocaust awareness among millennials and Generation Z while Arkansas had the lowest.

Wisconsin passed a bill in April that requires social studies classes in middle schools and high schools to teach about the Holocaust and other genocides.

“This bill will affect generations of kids in our state and bring increased awareness … in our schools to the tragedies of the Holocaust the pervasiveness of anti-Semitism to this day and hopefully cultivate a generation that is more compassionate more empathetic and more inclusive” Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said in a statement.

Under the new law school districts independent charter schools and private schools taking part in a choice program must teach about the Holocaust and other genocides at least once in grades five through eight and in high school.

Arkansas just passed a similar measure that goes into effect in the 2022-2023 school year.

Like Wisconsin the law in Arkansas calls for Holocaust lessons between fifth and 12 grades. Experts believe learning about genocide at a young age will lead to greater understanding and tolerance later on.

The Arkansas bill states that the lessons will help teach students about “the ramifications of bullying bigotry stereotyping and discrimination” while encouraging “tolerance of diversity and reverence for human dignity for all citizens.”"

Digital payments and financial services firm Paytm has received in-principle approval from the company's board to raise around Rs 22000 crore through an initial public offer during the October-December quarter this year according to an industry source.

The company is looking at an enterprise value of over Rs 2 lakh crore for the IPO which is likely to be discussed at its board meeting scheduled for Friday.

""The board of directors of Paytm has given in-principle approval for the mega IPO planned to be launched in October-December quarter. The company expects to raise around Rs 21000-Rs 22000 crore from the IPO. This will also give some of the existing investors to offload some of their stake"" the source aware of the development told PTI.

The board meeting of the company was held on Friday.

When contacted Paytm spokesperson declined to comment.

It is likely to be one of the largest IPOs in India if the company is able to achieve the target as per its plan.

Paytm shareholders include Alibaba's Ant Group (29.71 per cent) Softbank Vision Fund (19.63 per cent) Saif Partners (18.56 per cent) Vijay Shekhar Sharma (14.67 per cent).

AGH Holding T Rowe Price and Discovery Capital Berkshire Hathaway hold less than 10 per cent stake in the company.

Paytm claims to be around 30-50 per cent larger than mobile apps in the segment with over 1.4 billion monthly transactions.

The PlayStation 4 will be incredibly important to Sony over the next few years and the current-gen console is expected to prop up the PlayStation brand through the transition to PS5.

Sony expects big things from the PlayStation 5. The console is expected to beat the PS4's lifetime sales and Sony is preparing the largest-ever shipment of consoles for next fiscal year. However the PS4's mighty 116.4 million install base will continue being a tentpole for PlayStation earnings from now through 2023.

In a recent investor's meeting Sony Interactive President Jim Ryan details just how important the PS4 is to Sony's continued success. Sony expects the PS4 to have the largest tail of any PlayStation console and the PS4 will deliver a whopping 70% of PS Store spending in FY2022. This is the same year Sony will release a record-breaking 14.8 million+ PS5s onto the market.

Even as the PlayStation 5 is about to turn a profit Sony says the PS4 will still remain the top earner through 2023.

""We anticipate the PS4 will have the longest tail and deepest engagement of any our platforms. There are a number of reasons why we believe this will be the case"" Ryan said. ""First we anticipate that we will be able to retain many of the engagement gains that were made in 2020 during COVID and work-from-home. ""Secondly the line up of new software for PS4 for FY21 and FY22 is extremely robust. Publishers understand the opportunity the large and very engaged community offers and will exploit it. ""Third the explosive growth of the free-to-play category is perfectly-timed for the late life cycle gamer. ""And finally our PlayStation Plus subscription service provides us with an extremely efficient means in communicating with our large community. ""Great new PS4 releases and an expansive catalog mean that we expect the PS4 to account for 70% of next year's store spend despite the growing install base of the PS5.""

Sony previously said it plans to support the PlayStation 4 until at least 2023 and it's possible cross-gen releases could come after that too.

So far no big publisher is ready to make next-gen console exclusives and abandon the PS4's mighty install base.

Activision released on last-gen with CoD in 2020 and will likely do the same for 2021. EA is releasing all of its games on PS4 including Battlefield 6 and so is Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive.

Android does not specify which games play offline and which ones don’t. Sometimes you might find the details in the app’s description but that is few and far between. If you don’t have a reliable connection when you play the game becomes impossible to use.

There are few things more annoying than being dropped from an online match in a great mobile game. It’s even worse when you download a single-player game only to find you still need an internet connection to play.

Fear not though as there are many Android games you can play without being connected to the internet. You’re not just restricted to smaller games either. Offline Android games also include larger-sized options. There’s something for everyone in the Android offline games library.

Many games are free to download and many are free with add-on purchase options although some larger titles will ask you to cough up some cash before you can play.

Bear in mind though that you’ll need an internet connection to download the games so do that before you get to your internet dark zone!

Editor’s note: The current debate in economics seems to lack a historical perspective. To try to address this deficiency we decided to launch a Sunday column on ProMarket focusing on the historical dimension of economic ideas. You can read all of the pieces in the series here.

The investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert is a good place to begin to dig into the character of the post-1982 business expansion. In enter­prise the turn to leveraged asset appreciation required nothing short of a revolution in US corporate governance in which financiers including investment bankers continued to wrest ever more power from an already-floundering managerial class.

The weapon was the new gospel of “shareholder value” which demanded that managers act in the pecuniary interests of shareholders. That often meant slashing wages foregoing long-term investments or selling off assets all in order to benefit the immediate bottom line. There was and is no hard law that says that US corporations must be motivated to maximize short-term profit. Most postwar industrial corporations focused on long-term growth metrics and the maintenance of “organizational slack” had not even tried. With the shareholder value revolution of the 1980s the present stock market price of corporate shares newly became the metric of corporate success.

What enthroned shareholder value was a wave of sometimes hostile corporate takeovers. The movement began in the late 1970s when oilmen flush with cash from the high prices of the oil shock came to believe that the stocks of large diversified energy companies were trading below the value of their physical assets. During his 1983 bid to take over Gulf Oil the Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens declared in The Wall Street Journal “We are dedicated to the goal of enhancing shareholder value.” That was one of the earliest uses of the phrase. Pickens tried to convince the majority of Gulf Oil shareholders to convey the corporation into Pickens’s “royalty trust.” Then he would sell off assets unrelated to the oil business returning cash to the owners. After that he would offer the stripped-down oil company back to the public hoping it would fetch a high value. Pickens never acquired majority control of Gulf Oil but management paid him “greenmail.” That is they bought back the shares that Pickens and his allies had accumulated at a price above the going market rate—far above what Pickens’s group had originally paid. Boone Houston oilman Oscar Wyatt Jr. and New Yorker Carl Icahn among other corporate “raiders” followed this strategy successfully. Icahn even “greenmailed” US Steel.

Corporate raiders could never have pulled off the shareholder revolution by themselves. They needed help in the capital markets. Joining corporate raiders were institutional investors especially public and private pension funds. In other words accumulations of capital that were the result of the postwar politics of pay funded changes in corporate governance that ironically enough undermined the politics of pay. The critical economic site shifted from income to property. If working people began to use debt to compensate for flagging pay and to sustain consumption then leveraged buyouts demonstrated how property owners could use debt to leverage up their profits from their investments. In all relative income growth shifted away from labor to capital.

During the 1970s inflation had cut into pension funds’ investment returns and new state and federal laws enabled them to seek riskier investments. In 1975 pension funds owned $113 million worth of stocks. In 1980 they owned $220 million. In 1985 they owned $440 million. This was a perfect example of how capital began to newly traverse asset classes in this period. The fund managers in charge of these investments believed they could hedge the risk of stock market investments through new financial products. For instance pension funds bought “portfolio insurance” in which computers automatically sold off stocks from their portfolios if stock prices declined. The academic theory behind portfolio insurance assumed transactional liquidity “that continuous trading was possible”—that there would always be two sides for a trade and not everybody would always be on the sell side. Furthermore in 1982 the Chicago Mercantile Exchange began selling stock index futures contracts—essentially an asset that tracked the price of the Standard & Poor 500 (called the “spooze”). Institutional investors with regulators approving bought them to hedge their stock market positions.

Hedges in hand institutional investors followed the raiders. In 1984 Texaco paid $55 million in “greenmail” to the Texas Bass family at $55 a share when the market price was $35. The trustees of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) the largest US public pension fund and one of the largest shareholders of Texaco wondered why CalPERS got nothing. CalPERS led the Council of Institutional Investors (1985) and joined the chorus demanding greater corporate focus on shareholder value. At all costs the managers must focus on company stock price.

“There was and is no hard law that says that US corporations must be motivated to maximize short-term profit.”

“Shareholder value” was the rallying cry for a wave of leveraged corporate buyouts and associated mergers and acquisitions. In 1982 in the midst of a revolution in antitrust law Reagan’s Justice Department changed its “merger guidelines.” No longer was the goal as stated in 1968 to “preserve and promote market structures conducive to competition.” The new standard in assessing a merger was only whether its outcome would or would not “maintain prices above competitive levels.” This reflected the spreading influence of the Chicago Law and Economics movement which argued that the only relevant standard for antitrust enforcement was “consumer welfare” or lower prices—not market structure or barriers to entry. Judges stripped antitrust prescriptions against vertical and horizontal mergers out of the law. Between 1985 and 1989 there were thousands of leveraged buyouts valued in excess of $250 billion.

Assuming that adequate greenmail was not paid the art of the leveraged buyout was this. Raiders and also new “private equity firms”—the largest at the time was Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR founded in 1976)—bought a portion of the target company’s shares usually between 5 and 10 percent. The game had begun. Other shareholders especially the large institutional investors had to be willing to sell out to the acquiring interest. Management could even choose to participate and often business consultants encouraged them to do so. A company was far more likely to engage in a buyout transaction when executives from the finance rather than production or sales side of the corporation were in leadership. If managers resisted the buyout would be “hostile.” To raise cash for the purchase of the shares buyers secured credit lines from banks or issued junk bonds—risky corporate bonds paying high yields. This was the final ingredient: the newly burgeoning debt market in junk bonds. They were what made the buyout leveraged. Investment bankers above all Michael Milken of Drexel Burnham Lambert made this market. Finally after investor groups built up a large stock position it offered corporate boards a bid—a named share price—to buy out the company and take possession and ownership of it.

Thus publicly traded companies became privately owned. But the company then had to raise cash to meet the debt payments. That normally meant selling physical assets as well as cutting operating costs—including labor costs. Spectacularly employee pension funds to compensate for their employees’ flat compensation growth sought yields by participating in leveraged buyouts which then led newly indebted corporations to slash wages and eliminate jobs—so they could meet their debt obligations. Commonly conglomerates were broken into parts with many divisions sold off. It was a vertical and horizontal disintegration of the postwar multidivisional industrial corporation—more purging of fixed capital more hemorrhaging of blue-collar jobs. After that the corporation was sold back to public capital markets hoping that the new share price had warranted the original purchase. If the stock prices kept going up generally it had. Even if the stock price rose did that necessarily mean that the underlying company was more valuable than it had been before the leveraged buyout? If the stock price rose did it matter?

The government yesterday unveiled a budget of Nu 80 billion (B) for the fiscal year 2021-22 aimed at maintaining public confidence and sustaining economic activities amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Of the total outlay the proposed capital expenditure is Nu 38.32B (48 percent) and the recurrent expenditure is Nu 35.598B (44 percent). The remaining budget has been appropriated for repayment of loans.

The capital budget for the fiscal year consists 33 percent of the total 12th Plan capital outlay which is one of the highest during the Plan period.

The practice of the capital budget ceiling at the agency level has been discontinued to ensure that budgetary bodies receive adequate capital budget for priority activities to support resilient economic recovery.

Presenting the budget Finance Minister Namgay Tshering said that as the pandemic continued to pose serious risks to health and the livelihoods of people the government provided necessary budget for ensuring public health and safety maintaining public confidence and macro-economic stability.

Accordingly the government has earmarked a budget of Nu 3B for Covid-19 related activities including maintenance of quarantine facilities purchase of test kits and vaccines.

The practice of capital budget ceiling at the agency level has been discontinued to ensure that budgetary bodies receive adequate capital budget for priority activities to support resilient economic recovery.

Fiscal deficit which signifies the gap between the government’s revenue and expenditure is estimated to widen to Nu 17.153 which is 8.59 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The government’s expansionary fiscal measure is aimed at helping economic recovery besides responding to containment measures.

“As a prudent financing strategy and to ensure debt sustainability the government shall resort to borrowings at lowest possible costs only after exhausting the possibilities of obtaining the required financing in the form of grants” Lyonpo Namgay Tshering said.

The government has estimated its total resources for the fiscal year at Nu 56.765B. This includes the domestic revenue of more than Nu 35.6B other receipts of Nu 640.27M and external grants of Nu 20.525B.

The domestic revenue is expected to grow by 7 percent during the fiscal year mainly on account of estimated growth from income taxes followed by increased consumption taxes.

The economic growth for the fiscal year 2021-22 is projected at 4.1 percent.

Lyonpo Namgay Tshering said that the Druk Gyalpo’s Relief Kidu in the form of income and interest payment support to affected individuals along with fiscal and monetary measures effectively mitigated the adverse impact to a large extent.

Major activities

The social service (health and education) sector has been allocated with the highest budget allocation of Nu 24.524B constituting 30 percent of the total allocation followed by 27 percent each for economic and public services sector (agriculture communications housing energy mining manufacturing and roads) and 24 percent for general public services.

The government has allocated Nu 140.5M for Food Corporation of Bhutan Limited (FCBL) to construct warehouse in two locations and cold storage in Phuentsholing to reduce import of potatoes during the lean seasons.

For supporting commercial organic farming Farm Machinery Corporation Limited (FMCL) will invest in technology for producing affordable organic bio-fertilizer in a large scale for which budget of Nu 22.1M has been provisioned.

The government has set aside more than Nu 5.835B for the road sector.

The major activities include construction of Phuentsholing-Chamkuna road Dalbari–Dagapela secondary national highway approach road at the National Service Center (NSC) at Taraythang Sarpang.

The LGs will receive 34 percent of the total capital budget. The budget allocation for local governments (LGs) is almost Nu 26.032B of which Nu 12.795B is for recurrent and Nu 13.235B million is for the capital expenditure.

However including the centrally executed activities in various dzongkhags thromdes and gewogs amounting to Nu 6.61B the actual capital budget share of LGs is estimated at 52 percent of the total capital allocation.

The finance minister said that the LGs would continue to receive the budget in the form of annual grants from the government. With respect to the external funded activities budget is provided as project-tied.

The budget also aims to transform health and education system.

The major activities under the health sector include development of health infrastructures such as ancillary works at Gidakom costing Nu 114.815M an additional hospital wing at Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital (JDWNRH) costing Nu 123.983M and a dedicated water supply for JDWNRH at the cost of Nu 16.98M.

Besides the flagship programs other regular are school infrastructure developments the government has provisioned budget to provide scholarships to Class XI and XII students in private schools undergraduate scholarships and capacity development for the universities.

To stimulate economic activities and encourage private sector participation the government will continue investing in construction maintenance and blacktopping of roads according to the budget.

The government will construct 36 chiwog roads 27 farm roads blacktop 22 gewog centre roads and continue to improve existing farm roads (GSB and drainage).

The government will invest Nu 515M for construction and maintenance of irrigation channels.

I had been looking for over a year and since there are so few Teslas in SwedenI assumed that I had to look around in Europe to find the right car but the health situation has made it impossible.When this car was turned up for sale I saw that it was of low interest due to its background. The car salesman did not know anything at all about the car so I bought it at a very good price. It is equipped with AP1 free supercharging premium audio and premium connectivity.The screenshot is from Scan my Tesla and there are some numbers that sticks out:Nominal remainingkWh out of nominal full packkWhSuperchargingkWh out of total chargekWhThe car has been superchargedof itscharge cycles.I have been confirmed from Tesla support that the battery has not been changed and the sticker shows its the original battery that came with the car.I have started a YouTube channel to show people how old tesla age and what the quality of Teslas is and how they hold up after many miles.Please have a look and support my new channel by subscribing to it.Sorry for my long first post,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzUvMzAvMjI0NTc0NTUvdGVzbGEtdGV4YXMtZmFjdG9yeS1sYXctc2hpcC1vdXQtb2Ytc3RhdGUtZGlyZWN0LXNhbGUtbGVnaXNsYXRpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teslas made in Texas will likely have to leave the state before Texans can buy them,"Tesla is building a factory in Texas to make some of its cars but when it’s up and running the cars made there may have to go on a roundabout journey to get to Texan buyers (via The Drive). Because of state laws banning car companies from selling directly to consumers Tesla could end up shipping the cars from its Austin factory to other states before they’re sent back to their Texan buyers. The state’s lawmakers were debating legislation that would have prevented the situation but they’ve now missed their chance to pass it before they have to go on break until 2023 — the factory is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.

Laws preventing automakers from selling their vehicles directly to consumers aren’t unique to Texas nor are they targeted at Tesla: they were originally put in place in many states to keep manufacturers from undercutting their franchised dealers and putting them out of business. Tesla doesn’t have franchised dealers to protect but that doesn’t matter to Texas law as it’s currently written.

It’s an embarrassing situation for the state where a worker at the new factory (where Tesla plans on investing a billion dollars) would have to wait for a car they made to travel to a dealership in another state for processing and then return to them. That could even be the case for Elon Musk himself who said he had moved to the state earlier this year. It’s also a little embarrassing for Tesla which decided to build a factory in the state without securing a deal to sell its cars there.

There was a bill proposed in the Texas legislature seemingly tailored to help Tesla: it would have let companies sell their cars directly to consumers if they were completely driven by electricity or battery-power and only if those companies never had franchised dealerships in the state. That could rule out companies like Ford even though it sells EVs but might also allow other EV makers like Rivian Lucid and Canoo to sell directly once they start producing vehicles.

Tesla and other EV manufacturers have been fighting in many states to get permission to sell directly for years and have even had a few recent successes: Tesla has been allowed to sell in Colorado (where Rivian recently got access as well) and Tesla was able to work out a legal loophole in Michigan. As many as 12 states allow Tesla to sell directly to customers and others let Tesla open a limited number of dealerships.

But there are many states where hopeful buyers still have to jump through hoops like having to mail paperwork across state borders to get temporary tags or drive to other states to make the purchase: Oklahoma Nebraska Wisconsin West Virginia Alabama South Carolina New Mexico and of course Texas have all proposed direct sales but the bills have all been shut down tabled indefinitely or ignored for years. Tesla even has a page on its website where it asks customers to engage with their elected officials about these cases.

Connecticut another state where direct selling isn’t allowed (though Tesla can lease cars to customers there) currently has legislation in the works to allow direct sales and Tesla and Rivian are working together to try and get legislation through in other states this year as well. In many of the states Tesla has found a way to get cars to customers but not without hassle.

Gubernatorial reprieve is possible

For Texas though the wait for legislation could be a while. Elon Musk tweeted in response to The Drive’s article about lawmakers running out of time pushing for a change in the state. It’s not impossible that it could happen even with the legislature on break until 2023: Governor Greg Abbott (who called Tesla “one of the most exciting and innovative companies in the world” when it announced its Texas factory) could call a special session to focus on the un-passed law. Abbott did not respond to a request for comment about whether he intends to do so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vdGVzbGEtbW9kZWwtcy1wbGFpZC1kZWxpdmVyeS1ldmVudC1qdW5lLTEwL9IBSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vdGVzbGEtbW9kZWwtcy1wbGFpZC1kZWxpdmVyeS1ldmVudC1qdW5lLTEwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla delays Model S Plaid delivery event to June 10 ‘one more week of tweak’ needed,"By

Tesla has delayed its Model S Plaid delivery event to June 10th after CEO Elon Musk said the vehicle needs “one more week of tweak.”

On May 20th Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the automaker would officially begin delivering the long-awaited Model S Plaid variant to pre-orderers at the company’s Fremont factory in Northern California. The date was scheduled for June 3rd but now Musk says that the vehicle isn’t quite ready to make its way to customers.

“Needs one more week of tweak” Musk said in a Tweet.

Model S Plaid delivery pushed to June 10. Needs one more week of tweak. This car feels like a spaceship. Words cannot describe the limbic resonance. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 29 2021

The Model S is Tesla’s flagship vehicle. It was first delivered in 2012 and was the company’s first-ever passenger vehicle following the first generation Tesla Roadster in 2008. During the Q4 2020 Earnings Call Tesla announced that it would be refreshing the Model S with a completely revamped interior and deliveries were set to begin in February. However Tesla had some delays with production although it is not known what exactly caused the initial hold up.

For months Plaid Model S reservation holders have awaited any sort of detail regarding when their car would be delivered. Some builds of the Model S Plaid were spotted on haulers outside the Fremont factory in March but Musk told Teslarati that there were “still many fine details to address but the final product will be fantastic. There’s nothing else even close.”

Still many fine details to address but the final product will be fantastic. There’s nothing else even close. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 8 2021

No details regarding the event itself have been released.

The Model S Plaid has been spotted in the wild several times since its announcement during the Q4 2020 Earnings Call. Tesla routinely tests new vehicles in the areas surrounding Fremont. The most recent was in San Francisco when Teslarati reader Blake Marvin spotted a Model S Plaid build on the street in his neighborhood.

The new Model S starts at $79990 for the Long Range Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive setup and $119990 for the Plaid Powertrain. The Plaid+ Powertrain is $149990 and will be available in mid-2022 but Tesla is currently not accepting orders for this vehicle as it is evidently sold out.

Tesla has activated a facial recognition technology in its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles to ensure that the driver is in the seat and watching the road when using the cars' advanced driver assist systems.

The two vehicles have always been produced with the cameras near the rearview mirrors which Elon Musk initially said would be used to monitor for vandalism when their promised fully autonomous driving capability is launched and they are deployed as ride-hailing vehicles.

Tesla had been criticized for not using the technology after several reports of drivers riding in the front passenger and rear seats of the vehicles with no one behind the wheel surfaced.

Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features also require the driver to keep a hand on the wheel but this method is easily spoofed by attaching a weight to it.

The current Model S and Model X do not have the camera but new versions of both vehicles are entering production this year.

General Motors' Super Cruise highway driving system has always been equipped with facial recognition tech and allows drivers to remove their hands from the wheel for extended periods as long as they are watching the road.

Tesla owners received a message in their cars about the update to assuage privacy fears which said ""camera data does not leave the car itself which means the system cannot save or transmit information unless data sharing is enabled.""

In March Musk revealed that Tesla was collecting camera data from owners who were using a Beta version of the next software update for the Full Self-Driving system and revoked access from several who were caught misusing the system."

They’ll already have jobs and college degrees.,"When area high school graduates celebrate the end of a challenging year in June these five Dallas seniors already will be two weeks into their full-time paid internships at Texas Instruments.

Aaron Barrientos 17 will study electrical engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington alongside his work diagnosing problems or cleaning the machines at Texas Instruments. Doing both opens up even more opportunities he said.

“Now I know I can do the internship and college at the same time” Barrientos said.

The students’ jobs represent the final steps of their early college program at H. Grady Spruce High School where they focused on mechatronics.

The program prepares students for careers that involve engineering mechanics and electronics. Graduates may work at jobs diagnosing mechanical issues at manufacturing plants or help automate the shipping and distribution systems for major companies such as Walmart.

In Texas a small but growing number of students are obtaining associate degrees and industry certifications through programs like the one at Spruce.

In 2018-19 nearly 2% of graduating seniors — about 7100 students — obtained their associate degree and 10.7% of students earned an industry-based certification according to the most recent state data. The number of students obtaining both their associate degree and industry-based certifications more than doubled over two years prior.

Spruce’s program a partnership between DISD and Dallas College Eastfield Campus has led to job offers and livable wages for the majority of its graduates since the early college program’s inception. This year Texas Instruments offered six-month internships to all of the program’s graduating seniors.

The seniors start right after high school and are paid a generous salary for 17- and 18-year-olds entering the workforce — $40000 a year. They could also qualify for a $10000 raise and a full-time job offer within six months said Russell “Rusty” Dale one of the program’s instructors.

Demand is growing for skill-focused programs because of student interest and companies’ need for talent.

That’s pushed more Texas school districts to invest in career and technical education. Just this year Dale helped launch a mechatronics program in Garland and is working to do the same in Mesquite very soon.

Grand Prairie is among the most enthusiastic adopters of career and technical education offering nearly 30 pathways including architecture dentistry automotive technology and culinary arts.

The school district works with a demographer to plot out which industries will have the most growth and which jobs will offer livable wages. GPISD officials recently opened a cybersecurity and computer science pathway and are exploring a travel and tourism program as a result of that research.

“We are providing opportunities for students and their families if they don’t want to go to college” said Aniska Douglas the district’s director of career and technical education. “It’s generational right? Once they obtain a skill set in a job you know their kids and their kids’ kids are going to aim for that same goal as well.”

Completing one of the pathways doesn’t mean students won’t seek out higher education. Some graduates use their certifications and ensuing jobs as supplemental income while attending college or put the college credit earned in high school to good use at a university.

Grand Prairie Dubiski Career High School senior Faith Ajanaku for instance plans to attend Stanford University while working as an emergency medical technician — that is once she turns 18 and can complete the certification.

“The wonderful thing about getting our certifications is that we can do both [college and our jobs] at the same time” Ajanaku said.

Several graduates in Spruce’s mechatronics program also hope to balance college classes alongside their internships.

High school senior Katherine Pardo wants to pursue nursing. She is still making college plans but hopes to work as a technician at Texas Instruments while she learns about the medical field.

Even if students end up in different fields the skills learned in the mechatronics program are transformative instructor Sheldon Ingersoll said.

Ingersoll completed Eastfield College’s mechatronics program as an adult and began earning nearly $60000 in his first year out of school. He realized the financial impact the program had in his own life when he replaced his truck’s tires and didn’t have to decide what bill he would forgo paying that month.

Equipping students with those abilities right out of high school is life-changing. “It’s the only way to put it” Ingersoll said.

Senior Nitza Udave will see an immediate change in her life after she begins her Texas Instruments internship. The starting salary will be more than her mom a teacher’s assistant makes.

But graduating from the program and going straight into the workforce will bring more than just monetary benefits to Udave and her family. It will provide a good example for her 9-year-old brother she said.

“He’s a good student too and I just want to be a good role model for him” Udave said.

Officers at U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have noticed an increasing number of third-party sites claiming to help foreign travelers apply for the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA).

Third-party companies who charge a fee to assist travelers in registering under ESTA or other government programs like Global Entry do not operate on behalf of the U.S. government. While all of these companies are not illegal some have gone so far as to mimic the CBP website. Note that U.S. government websites can be identified by the “.gov” domain. Also CBP does not work with third-party companies and cannot guarantee the legitimacy of these companies or the safety of travelers’ privacy.

CBP is committed to its privacy obligations and has taken steps to safeguard the privacy of all travelers. Information submitted by applicants through the ESTA website is subject to strict privacy provisions and controls. Access to such information is limited to those with a professional need to know. The website is operated by the U.S. government and employs technology to prevent unauthorized access to the information entered and viewed. Information is protected and governed by U.S. laws and regulations including but not limited to the Federal Information Security Management Act.

“These businesses and websites are not endorsed by associated with or affiliated in any way with U.S. Customs and Border Protection or the U.S. government” said CBP Office of Field Operations Executive Director Matthew S. Davies. “The best way to avoid ESTA fraud is by applying only through the official ESTA website.”

Travelers who have used a third-party site are advised to use their reference number to confirm the application on the ESTA site to ensure that the application information is correct in the system and to avoid delays upon arrival in the United States. The U.S. government cannot refund the money paid to a third-party website.

Travelers can easily apply for or renew an ESTA on their own for $14 through the ESTA website. The traveler must have a valid passport from a Visa Waiver Country and have a valid email address telephone number and home address. Additionally the traveler must have an emergency and U.S. point of contact with contact information.

ESTA is an automated system used to determine the eligibility of visitors to travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) and whether such travel poses any law enforcement or security risk. ESTA is not a visa and does not meet the legal requirements to serve in lieu of a U.S. visa when a visa is required. Travelers who possess a valid U.S. visa may travel to the United States on that visa for the purpose it was issued and are not required to apply for an ESTA. In the same way that a valid visa does not guarantee admission to the United States an approved ESTA is not a guarantee of admission to the United States.

Just days before the busy Memorial Day travel weekend the revamped Salt Lake City International Airport hit the brakes on the car-sharing service Avail.

Launched in Utah in 2019 the company quickly became a disruptor of the car rental industry nationwide. Travelers flying out of the airport can park their car with Avail for free while they’re gone and passengers flying into Utah can borrow the car for less than a traditional rental. The person loaning out the car either makes a few bucks on the side or at least comes home to a sparkling clean vehicle and no parking fee.

Avail partners with a commercial airport parking and shuttle company to make everything work. But the Salt Lake City airport put an end to Avail’s business May 23 when it required that partner to stop working with third parties including peer-to-peer services.

“We had to make a lot of cancellations” said Avail CEO Mike Osborn. “A whole bunch of customers are scrambling at the last minute and prices are just crazy right now.”

Demand for travel is surging as people get vaccinated and destinations ease restrictions.

That trend coupled with a vehicle shortage from the pandemic made Avail one of the few affordable choices for a temporary set of wheels. And with the car-sharing company now offline in Utah its customers are not happy.

“I just got an email saying that they are canceling our reservation and that we cannot park with them” one customer wrote in a May 23 Yelp review. “I had to go find other parking and pay for it. Avail is a scam company that will leave you hanging last minute.”

Osborn said it’s no coincidence the airport shut down his business ahead of a peak travel period. He suspects the powerful car rental industry lobbied against Avail.

“We know these companies really well; we know how aggressive they are” Osborn said. “We’ve seen them in every market try to influence airport officials.”

The CEO added that the 14 other Avail-serviced airports — including Denver Phoenix and Los Angeles — are more open to innovation.

A competitive edge?

Shane Andreasen a director at the Salt Lake City airport said his office has been trying since Avail’s beginnings to get it to sign a car rental operating agreement.

“They don’t view themselves as a rental car company and they so far have refused to sign our agreement” Andreasen said. “We have an obligation to treat similarly situated tenants the same. ... We can’t give one of them a competitive advantage over the other and that’s really what they’re looking for.”

The airport currently has nine car rental companies on-site. Those companies competed in a bidding process and received 10-year contracts.

“With those terms comes a really high level of service and also a high expense” Andreasen said. “They rent the facilities from us. They pay a significant amount of rent so we’re always looking to preserve their revenue stream.”

The airport also allows six car rental companies to operate off-site with a shuttle service via permit.

“They pay 10% of gross revenues to access the airport” Andreasen said. “And that’s industry standard across the country.”

Avail’s business model attempts to skirt car rental fee requirements he added creating an unfair business environment.

Osborn said the airport’s requirements instead place an unfair burden on his business. He already pays taxes to the city for cars that stay overnight at his partner parking lot as well as a vehicle use fee every time a shuttle takes his customers to the airport.

Asking Avail to pay an additional 10% of its revenues to the airport he argued is like being taxed twice.

“That’s the crux of it here” Osborn said. “... The model for rental cars did not contemplate also a parking element.”

He especially bristled at the notion of signing a permit labeling Avail as a car rental company instead of a car-sharing service.

“As soon as we blur that distinction then that backfires across the country” Osborn said. “Lawyers tell me it’s real important.”

Seeking a legislative fix

The debate over car sharing isn’t limited to Utah. Earlier this spring the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled against Turo a company with a similar model to Avail after the operators of the Boston Logan International Airport alleged the company illegally avoided paying car rental fees.

Some airports are willing to explore pilot programs with car-sharing companies. Denver International is allowing Avail to operate at least for now on a daily $10 per parking stall fee plus 5% of the company’s local revenue according to the Denverite news site.

The car-sharing clash harks to the “Wild West” days when ride-hailing platforms like Uber and Lyft began piling up cars in airport pickup lanes several years ago.

After ironing out some regulations and a fee structure the peer-to-peer service was allowed to continue. Ride sharing now accounts for 70% of commercial trips to and from the Salt Lake City airport and the facility has been heavily redesigned to accommodate Uber and Lyft.

Now with car-sharing again transforming the way people get around Salt Lake City airport officials and Avail operators are looking to the Utah Legislature to sort out the ensuing mess.

Rep. Robert Spendlove R-Sandy said he’s working on a bill for the next legislative session that would strike a compromise between car-sharing platforms car rental companies and the airport regulating them.

Xiinbal which means “walking” in Maya is the regular passenger service. It is designed for frequent local travelers as well as occasional travelers and tourists.

According to the description these wagons will have business class seats which offer the highest quality and comfort; standard seats and cafeteria car.

“Passengers can stretch their legs while visiting the cafeteria and mingle with other passengers in an open and relaxing space. The partition doors isolate passengers in the adjacent seating areas from noise and movement in this iconic part of the train. “

On Janal wagons an on-board restaurant is incorporated into these services inspired by Aquatic Landscapes while the interior refers to the work of Luis Barragán.

“The restaurant offers two design options and various seating configurations to allow optimal use of space in a beautiful setting.”

In the third train service P’atal passengers are offered the possibility of traveling both in comfortable reclining seats and in sleeping cabins thinking of those tourists who will use the service over long distances.

According to Fonatur this model of Alstom train service is used as suburban and regional transport in places like Melbourne Australia; Paris France Catalonia Spain and Santiago de Chile.

Fonatur has not yet disclosed the cost that each passenger ticket will have although a differentiated rate is foreseen for local passengers and tourists.

Ogden who opened a branch of his father’s surveying company in Redding in the 1960s and built it into the multi-million-dollar global corporation SECO Manufacturing Co. died Wednesday after a long illness. He was 81.

Former Redding Mayor Mike Dahl worked alongside Ogden for more than 30 years. The two started working together in 1975.

“He asked me if I wanted to work with him for a while” Dahl recalled Thursday. “I said ‘sure’ and I thought maybe it would be a one-year gig. Then 35 years later I was still with the guy and now it’s a multi-million-dollar corporation.”

Ogden's son Mark who was SECO's chief financial officer said his father ""was such a driving force behind the business.""

""If somebody would tell him he couldn't do something he would look them straight in the eye and say 'Bet me' "" Mark Ogden said.

Mark Ogden his brother Mike Ogden and Dahl all were on SECO Manufacturing's board before it was sold.

When GPS maker Trimble bought SECO

Paul Ogden sold SECO to GPS manufacturer Trimble Navigation of Sunnyvale in 2008. Dahl then SECO’s vice president stayed on for five more years as the general manager of the Redding plant on Belt Line Road where it still operates today.

By the time Ogden sold SECO the company had become a familiar brand in the surveying industry.

“At the time they were going to drop the logo and (SECO) name because they thought Trimble might have brand identity” Dahl said. “What they found out in our market niche was that was not true and SECO had … name recognition and brand equity.”

Ogden's father Ivan created Ogden Surveying Equipment Co. in Sacramento in 1944. Paul opened a branch in Redding in 1965 and then rebranded the business as Surveying Equipment Company or SECO.

When Trimble purchased SECO 13 years ago the Redding firm had 120 people working in Redding and 80 at its manufacturing plant in Tecate Mexico.

Mark Ogden said his father employed a lot of people over the years in Redding including many of his high school friends.

""He cared about his employees; he knew 'em all. At one point we had 160 people here in Redding working for us"" Mark Ogden said.

""I only worked for one person all my life and it was my dad. ... We had our ups and downs and stuff but man it was just a wild ride.""

Paul Ogden a 'classic risk taker'

Along with running a successful surveying business Ogden also served nine years on the Enterprise Public Utilities District Shasta County Planning Commission and Redding Planning Commission and ran for a Shasta County supervisor seat in 1972. He also was a longtime member of the Asphalt Cowboys.

Dahl said Ogden was keenly interested and fascinated with government and politics.

It was Dahl then mayor of Redding who recommended Ogden for the planning commission in 1987.

Ogden was never afraid to take risks and despite failing sometimes he wouldn't let it stop him from the next endeavor Dahl said.

“He was the classic risk taker” Dahl said. “So many projects and dreams would come up and some of them failed and went nowhere. Overall though he definitely had more success than he failed.”

Said Mark Ogden: ""If he got knocked down he would get back up again. He just never stopped.""

Even after he sold SECO Mark said his father kept very busy. That included being part of a team that built a Bonneville Salt Flats race car that Paul Ogden owned. The modified 1968 Plymouth Barracuda nicknamed ""The Flying Fish"" broke a world record at the popular racing site in Utah by going 222 mph in October 2010 according to a Record Searchlight story. The car beat its own record the following year when it returned to Bonneville hitting 241 mph.

""He didn't drive it. He had other people drive it"" Mark Ogden said. ""He and I built a 1959 Cadillac. It started out we were going to restore it back to the original then it morphed into this giant hot rod.""

Dahl recalls Ogden and a friend years ago paddling down the Sacramento River to the Carquinez Strait in a wooden canoe.

“Some people would say Paul was quite a colorful character but I don’t think that term captures the true essence of his person” Dahl said. “People would say to him ‘You can’t do that.’ And he would say ‘Well watch me.' ”

Dahl heard Wednesday about Ogden’s death.

“People that grew up with him … would say Paul was like a bear. This guy will never die. So when it finally happened it was kind of a shock” he said.

The Asphalt Cowboys plan to host a celebration of life for Ogden at a to-be-determined date Mark Ogden said.

""He knew so many people. He was part of this community for so many years"" he said.

A lack of hitting with runners in scoring position haunted Miami (32-19 20-15 Atlantic Coast Conference) late while Florida State (30-22 20-16 ACC) secured a 6-3 victory in the quarterfinal round of the ACC Baseball Championship at Truist Field in Charlotte North Carolina.

“We gotta find a way to score more runs we gotta find a way to get our lineup going” Hurricanes coach Gino DiMare said. “Not enough pressure we’re putting on the pitchers not enough pressure we’re putting on their defense and we gotta make some adjustments.”

An offensive spark came about in the fourth inning though did not carry all the way through the ninth.

Designated hitter Raymond Gil sliced into the 3-1 deficit with a solo home run to center field and first baseman Alex Toral was then hit by a pitch. Catcher Carlos Perez grounded into a double play and Dominic Pitelli’s swinging strikeout ceased the momentum however.

“I think we just all have to be better one through nine everyone including myself too” Gil said of the lineup’s inconsistency. “We have to be locked in for every at-bat for nine innings and not take innings or at-bats off…doing what the situation calls for.”

With still a one-run advantage Florida State regained control in the fifth as its first five batters reached base without an out.

Two consecutive singles to start the inning set up leadoff hitter Tyler Martin as the first baseman laid down an RBI bunt to third base forcing DiMare to signal for freshman right-handed pitcher Alejandro Rosario to fill in for freshman starter Jake Garland (6-3 5.4 ERA).

“For us we’ve been playing good defense but didn’t do that today” DiMare said. “That one inning costed us a couple errors it was played a sac bunt and there were able to capitalize on that with a few runs. They started out of the gate with a three-spot there too which is not good.”

The Seminoles weren’t exactly finished yet either. A sacrifice fly to center field from catcher Matheu Nelson put FSU ahead 5-2 for the Hurricanes’ largest deficit of the tournament.

With FSU starting pitcher Parker Messick lifted after a one-hour-and-10-minute rain delay Miami still grappled to drive in runs. A first-pitch base hit placed catcher Adrian Del Castillo on first base though a Christian Del Castillo fly-out to left field and two following strikeouts kept the Hurricanes silent.

Seminoles reliever Clayton Kwiatkowski forced a pair of ground outs to begin the seventh and struck out center fielder Tony Jenkins on a full count to hold Miami off the base paths. The southpaw followed by sitting down three additional Miami batters in the eighth.

FSU added a knock-out blow in the ninth behind center fielder Logan Lacey’s home run to left off closer Carson Palmquist to keep the Seminoles ahead for good in the ninth.

An answer came in the bottom of the inning due to a single to left field from pinch hitter CJ Kayfus that filled the bases. Third baseman Jose Izarra then reached first on a fielder’s choice to score Christian Del Castillo though Kayfus was out at second base.

Jenkins worked an eight-pitch walk to keep UM alive but second baseman Anthony Vilar could not carry the momentum as the sophomore struck out looking.

Garland allowed all five earned runs on six hits and one walk and was tagged with the loss while Seminoles starter Parker Messick (7-2 3.32 ERA) garnered his second win against Miami this season having surrendered two runs on five hits and struck out seven batters.

“At the end of the day we got to get ready for the NCAA Tournament and everybody’s gonna be 0-0 and we have to find a way to be at our best when we start on Friday” DiMare said.

There was much to celebrate at the Hellertown-Lower Saucon Chamber of Commerce’s semi-annual Honors & Hors D’oeuvres event at which local businesses and organizations were recognized for persevering to serve the community during a difficult period.

Held Tuesday under the pavilion in Hellertown’s Dimmick Park the sold-out soiree featured light bites and an open bar. It was also attended by nearly 200 business and civic leaders along with elected officials family members and friends of the recipients.

The 2021 award recipients included: Black River Farms & Winery Small Business Leadership Award; Dewey Fire Company & EMS Lower Saucon Fire Rescue & Steel City Volunteer Fire Company Community Partner Award; David Heintzelman and the team at Heintzelman Funeral Home Community Lifestyle Award; Westley Morris of Saucon Valley Massage Therapy Good Samaritan Award; Saucon Valley Community Center Champion Nonprofit Award; and Hellertown-Lower Saucon Chamber Chairman Ricky Gower Jr. Outstanding Achievement Award. All of the recipients were praised for their unique ability to lead during the coronavirus pandemic which created unprecedented economic and other challenges.

Lower Saucon Fire Rescue Chief Ty Johnson recalled the anxious uncertainty that the volunteer fire crews felt during the early days of the pandemic when they responded to accidents not knowing how vulnerable they might be to the infectious respiratory disease.

“Thankfully we had very little impact on our members with COVID” he said.

Gower who will step down from his leadership role with the chamber at the end of June was recognized for his commitment to service during an extremely challenging time for many local businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019 due to unforeseen circumstances he retook the reigns of the organization which he had previously chaired.

Gower of BB&T now Truist will be succeeded by his bank colleague Kim Rosario who was on hand to help present him with the award along with immediate past chair and Hellertown Borough Council President Tom Rieger.

“He has been a true champion for many many years” said Rosario. “He just continues to be a great mentor leader and friend.”

Gower noted that he will continue to have close ties to the chamber since he is engaged to Jessica O’Donnell the Greater Lehigh Valley Chamber of Commerce’s Executive Vice President for Affiliated Chambers. (Hellertown-Lower Saucon is an affiliated chamber.)

“There’s so many more people here that are more deserving of this (award) than I am” he said adding that Hellertown-Lower Saucon will always have a “special place” in his heart.

Another award recipient Saucon Valley Community Center Executive Director Roberta Blackwell spoke to some of the difficulties her team has faced due to COVID-19 which she said had seriously impacted young children both emotionally and educationally.

“Children are our future” Blackwell said. “We are doing everything every day to keep children learning.”

The Honors & Hors D’oeuvres event was presented by numerous local business sponsors including Hellertown’s Steel Club.

“Steel Club is honored to support the recognition of this year’s well-deserved awardees” said the club’s general manager Grace Spirk. “These businesses demonstrate resilience and dedication while continuing to have a positive impact on our community.”

“People would think the guy would eat a truckful. Nah man.”

Tyson Fury’s nutritionist George Lockhart has revealed how ‘The Gypsy King’ sensationally lost 30 pounds in 30 days.

Fury has often battled with obesity during periods away from the ring. After agreeing to a rematch with Wladimir Klitschko back in 2016 Fury said he had “no motivation” to go ahead with the fight.

At his heaviest he weighed around 150 kilograms and also experienced severe bouts of depression.

Last year The Gypsy King told JOE: “I’m a two-time heavyweight champion of the world and I’ve never had a good body ever.”

Around the same time Fury sought the help of top sports nutritionist George Lockhart.

A former US Marine and MMA fighter Lockhart is one of the most renowned nutritionists and weight-cutting specialists in the world of combat sport.

He counts Conor McGregor the Diaz brothers and fellow boxer Billy Joe Saunders among his previous clientele.

Lockhart admits to being surprised by Fury’s eating habits.

“The only thing weird about Tyson is how much he eats” he says.

“People would think the guy would eat a truckful. Nah man. He’ll be like ‘Do I have to finish this?’

“‘Nah man you’re good bro.”

Lockhart says that on one occasion 126-pound featherweight Isaac Lowe was given most of Fury’s unwanted food and wolfed it down in 20 seconds – much to the amazement of the nutritionist.

How Tyson Fury lost 30 pounds in 30 days

“With Tyson it’s mainly just food awareness” says Lockhart.

“He didn’t use to eat a whole lot of bad foods but it [weight gain] would come from snacking and stuff.”

The last time the pair worked together Fury managed to blitz a serious amount of body fat in a short space of time.

“The last time I went to his house there was no fight scheduled. So it was a month. And we made it a goal to just lose as much fat as possible. We lost 30 pounds in 30 days.”

Speaking exclusively to JOE Lockhart said that in order to kickstart his weight loss programme he had Fury follow an unconventional fasting protocol.

“He fasts once a week every week.”

This fast lasts the whole 24 hours according to Lockhart who chuckles to himself when he says:

“We pick a day. We used to fast… We say ‘we’ I didn’t fast with him.

“But every Thursday we’d fast.”

Lockhart asserts that Fury’s performance didn’t suffer from going without food for a full day.

“It became easier and easier for him but he would drop body fat and everything else and the performance was good to go.”

The problem with intermittent fasting

Some studies indicate that short-term fasting periods of between 24 and 48 hours may work via a process called autophagy.

Lockhart says: “In terms of fasting autophagy is one of the biggest benefits. It’s the recycling and regeneration of cells.

“To do that you need to be in a certain state and the way we do it is having our fighters do an extended anaerobic workout to deplete carb stores then we’ll have them fast for 24 hours followed by an aerobic workout.”

Lockhart isn’t a fan of intermittent fasting however stating: “I know I’m probably gonna get a lot of slack for that.”

The problem with intermittent fasting is in the way most people conduct it he says.

“A lot of people don’t understand that fasting isn’t about depletion of calories. If you lose it when you fast as soon as you start drinking water or eating you’re gonna gain all the weight back.”

This unconventional approach to fasting merely laid the groundwork for Fury’s weight loss. Food held the real key.

Lockhart completely overhauled Fury’s nutrition plan. Out went snacking fast food and an overall lack of structure. In came a totally revitalised daily diet.

“His training didn’t change at all but I changed his nutrition. A lot of people don’t realise that you can train your butt off but if you eat like crap you’re not gonna lose any weight.”

""His favourite food is fish and chips."" 🍟 ""I said ‘There’s no way on God’s green Earth I can make you that!’"" This is how @Tyson_Fury lost 30 pounds in 30 days according to his nutritionist @LOCKloaded pic.twitter.com/O6UuBNd01f — JOE (@JOE_co_uk) May 27 2021

Tyson Fury’s daily diet

Describing Fury’s daily diet on his current plan Lockhart says:

“Typically his first meal of the day… He loves Greek yoghurt. Fruits I put flax seed honey on top lots of fruits and then walnuts.

“The fruits are there to fuel the brain and the Greek yoghurt I like for the [digestive] system. Just a real clean meal.

“His [Fury’s] number one go-to food is poké. He loves poké. And he likes fried rice. When I say fried rice it ain’t fried rice.

“I’ve got to make it with cauliflower – it simulates fried rice.”

Fury has one salmon a day in addition to poké with the omega 3 fatty acids in oily fish providing vital anti-inflammatory benefits.

Tyson Fury’s favourite food

The Gypsy King’s fondness for fish does need to be reeled in at times however.

“I’m like ‘What is your favourite meal?’ He says ‘I guess fish and chips.’

“I had them out in England and there is no way on God’s green Earth I can make that!”

Across the pond takes on this British classic are even unhealthier according to Lockhart.

“I’m not saying it’s not healthy in England because you guys lightly batter it whereas in America it’s like… All batter.

“You’ll get a chicken nugget of fish.”

Fury is continuing to work with Lockhart in the run-up to the third Deontay Wilder fight.

“People saw a huge difference between the first Wilder fight and the second Wilder fight with his physique.

“This fight people are going to be shocked man. He’s going to look amazing.”"

The public health social and economic toll has been unprecedented in recent decades. As of mid-May 2021 more than 168 million people have been infected and 3.5 million have died of the disease. Based on estimated excess mortality for 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) recently indicated that the death toll is likely higher.

While this global crisis has unraveled social life across countries the equally devastating decades-old pandemic of tobacco use has continued unbated to claim lives and make people sick as it is causally linked to diseases of nearly all organs of the body. Around 25% of all heart disease deaths and 80% of lung cancer deaths are caused by smoking and many others are caused by exposure to secondhand smoke for example.

A different but devastating pandemic

Cigarette smoking is not only the most common form of tobacco use but one of the leading preventable risk factors for premature mortality worldwide  killing more than 8 million people a year including users and non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke.

Country evidence from China Italy and other countries suggests that smokers have higher odds of progression in COVID-19 severity and death compared to non-smokers. There are also significant health care costs for treating the diseases caused by tobacco use as well as the indirect economic costs that result from tobacco-attributable morbidity and mortality--on average smokers die 10 years earlier than nonsmokers which represents a major human capital loss in countries.

The above numbers point to an inescapable reality: tobacco use kills more people yearly than COVID-19. Far worse tobacco smoking is estimated to have killed 100 million people in the 20th Century and estimates suggest one billion people could die from smoking this century if no action is taken.

Although with delays and inadequacies and after much suffering this past year governments international agencies and communities have come to the realization that to suppress the spread of SARS-CoV-2 the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 disease and overcome the social and economic disruption it brought a coordinated well-organized and sustained global response is the only way out of this crisis.

Addressing the tobacco scourge with urgency

Similarly based on the painful lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic we cannot remain complacent in thinking that tobacco use is just another “endemic” condition in our communities and that this addiction will never go away. We must recognize however that this challenge is not an easy one to tackle and will require a sustained effort over the medium-term given the economic power of the tobacco industry. This becomes clear when one understands that in nominal terms the worldwide sales revenue of all tobacco products is forecast to increase on average by 2.5% per year between 2012 and 2025 eventually reaching US$888 billion by 2025 generating gigantic profits for the tobacco industry. It is not surprising to learn then from a Credit Suisse report that one dollar invested in tobacco stocks in 1900 was worth $6.3 million by 2010 165 times greater than the average industry.

As Prof. Chris Whitty England’s chief medical officer observed in a recent lecture “tobacco companies get people addicted in young age and then keep them addicted to something which they know will kill them” to maintain their profit shares. But we know how to address the tobacco scourge.

Indeed the 2005 Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) the first global treaty negotiated under the auspices of the WHO that has been ratified by 182 countries with more than 90% of the world population offers a menu of effective demand and supply reduction measures.

Key measures range from raising taxes on tobacco products to increase prices and reduce consumption and health risks while mobilizing additional tax revenue that enhances fiscal capacity of countries to fund priority investments and programs that benefit all; regulations to protect people from exposure to tobacco smoke in public places; comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising promotion and sponsorship; to interventions for strengthening governance arrangements to deal with illicit tobacco trade across the supply chain.

While the FCTC is a solid framework for tobacco control full implementation of some of its provisions at the country level continues to lag behind.

Commit to quit

I think that to celebrate this year’s World No Tobacco Day under the theme “Commit to Quit” it is apt to raise our collective voices to demand that countries worldwide support at the highest political levels the adoption and the full implementation of FCTC provisions to end the scourge of tobacco use and nicotine addiction. To this I would add the support that needs to be provided to initiatives such as Tobacco Free Portfolio which involves working collaboratively with the world’s largest financial organizations to implement tobacco-free finance policies—spanning lending investment and insurance.

The World Bank Group (WBG) has also been assisting countries to confront the development threat posed by tobacco use. The unambiguous Operational Directive 4.76 of 1999 mandates that the WBG does not lend directly to tobacco production processing or marketing; provide grants for investment in these activities; or guarantee investments loans or credits for these industries . WBG policy advice technical assistance and operations support tobacco tax increases to protect the population from health risks and to mobilize additional public revenue to aid in the post-pandemic recovery.

There is no time to lose. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the potential devastating impact of unattended public health social and environmental risks and their spillover effects in a fast-changing interconnected world. The sobering experience bestowed upon all of us by the still ongoing pandemic clearly illustrates the high price that societies pay for inaction in dealing with global challenges old and new. Tobacco use is a decades-old pandemic that needs to be suppressed once and for all across the world as a moral public health and development imperative.

For those like me who have lost loved ones due to lung cancer and other tobacco-related diseases preventing smoking and the use of e-cigarettes by young people to make the next generation tobacco free is not only the right thing to do; more importantly it represents the type of concerted global effort that is required to confront major societal risks that could undermine the development of healthy productive and more inclusive and equitable societies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzI5NDM5MjAtd2h5LXRoZS1waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEtZWFnbGVzLXNob3VsZC1hbHJlYWR5LXB1bnQtb24tdGhlLTIwMjEtbmZsLXNlYXNvbtIBggFodHRwczovL3N5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmJsZWFjaGVycmVwb3J0LmNvbS9hbXAvMjk0MzkyMC13aHktdGhlLXBoaWxhZGVscGhpYS1lYWdsZXMtc2hvdWxkLWFscmVhZHktcHVudC1vbi10aGUtMjAyMS1uZmwtc2Vhc29uLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why the Philadelphia Eagles Should Already Punt on the 2021 NFL Season,"Rich Schultz/Associated Press

On Feb. 4 2018 Philadelphia Eagles head coach Doug Pederson and quarterback Nick Foles stood atop a stage at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis and lifted the Lombardi Trophy as the champions of Super Bowl LII. It was the ultimate moment in the history of a franchise that was founded all the back in 1933.

A lot has changed in the three years since that crowning moment. Foles is gone traded to the Jacksonville Jaguars after that Super Bowl run. The quarterback he replaced that season (Carson Wentz) was also sent packing in a trade with the Indianapolis Colts that resulted in the largest dead salary-cap hit in NFL history. After last year's miserable 4-11-1 campaign Pederson was fired.

There's a new head coach in Nick Sirianni. A new starter at quarterback in second-year pro Jalen Hurts. It's rebuild time in the City of Brotherly Love.

But you won't hear the Eagles saying that. Coaches and players alike believe the team is capable of a quick turnaround. Of getting right back in the mix in the NFC East in 2021. Of winning the division and maybe even making a postseason run.

It's understandable that professional athletes would have that attitude. There are those who expect to win every game they play in—whether those expectations are reasonable or not. But the reality is that these Eagles are at best the No. 3 team in the NFL's weakest division. The absolute ceiling is maybe nine wins and getting pounded into goo in the Wild Card Round.

That's not going to help Philly—the ""Jeff Fisher Zone"" that is the middle of the league is the absolute worst place a franchise can be. The best thing for these Eagles in the long term is another painful year in the short term. A bad season would be a good thing.

The wisest course of action for the 2021 Eagles is looking to 2022—and punting on this year.

You won't hear much talk like that inside the building at the NovaCare Complex. As Paul Domowitch reported for the Philadelphia Inquirer veteran center Jason Kelce admitted that the team is in a ""transition period"" but he also believes that the Eagles can vie for a division title in 2021.

Michael Ainsworth/Associated Press

""The bottom line is we can be competitive and win games [this year]"" Kelce said. ""We can win this division. I have no doubt about that if we go out there and go about it the right way. We can improve and continue to get better as a team.""

Per Ken Belson of the New York Times Philadelphia general manager Howie Roseman echoed a similar refrain. The Eagles may be retooling but this isn't a multiyear effort—Philly plans to compete now. Roseman said:

""We're not looking at this like you know let's see how long that we can struggle. We're looking to turn this around as quickly as possible and we feel like we've done that. You talked about the transition from Coach [Andy] Reid and Coach [Chip] Kelly came in and we won 20 games the next two years. Coach Pederson came we won seven and then we won 35 the next three years. And so that's our goal and accumulating assets is a way to make us better quicker—it's not to sit here and just see how long it takes to get back on top.""

However while players team officials and the Eagles' rabid fanbase may have high hopes in 2021 once you get outside Eastern Pennsylvania they fade rapidly.

In his post-draft NFL power rankings at NBC Sports Peter King ranked the Eagles at No. 28 writing that ""this season falls under the category of a classic rebuilding year.""

The NFL Nation reporters at ESPN slotted the Eagles at No. 27. The NFL analysts here at Bleacher Report agreed with King ranking Philly 28th in the NFL.

""Three years ago confetti was raining down on the Eagles after a win in Super Bowl LII"" they wrote. ""But the 2021 iteration of the team is more likely to finish last in the NFC (L)East than first.""

All three sets of power rankings (and the vast majority of those elsewhere) have the Eagles last in the division.

Last year Philadelphia fielded the 24th-ranked offense in the league. That offense is now led by a second-year quarterback who completed 52 percent of his passes as a rookie. Even with first-round pick DeVonta Smith in the fold the team has the weakest receiving corps in the division. The offensive line features two starters in Brandon Brooks and Lane Johnson returning from major injuries.

Rich Schultz/Associated Press

In 2020 the Eagles ranked 19th in the league defensively. Said defense features an aging front a so-so (at best) group of linebackers and a secondary with one proven cornerback (Darius Slay) who is coming off arguably the worst season of his NFL career.

For this Eagles team to win the NFC East the Dallas offense needs to falter and the defense needs to fall apart (again). The Washington offense needs to implode while the defense regresses. All the new additions with Big Blue need to fail to make an impact. And Philadelphia needs to stay healthy and improve markedly on offense.

Could one of those dominoes fall? Sure. Will all of them? No and even if they did all it would earn the Eagles is the right to get blasted in the Wild Card Round at Lincoln Financial Field by an 11- or 12-win NFC West runner-up.

However the clouds could clear in Philly relatively quickly. If Wentz plays 75 percent of the offensive snaps in Indianapolis this year the Colts first-rounder in 2022 belongs to the Eagles. Miami's first-rounder next year belongs to Philadelphia after the Eagles traded down from No. 6 to No. 12 this year.

Both of those picks will more likely than not fall in the second half of the first round—quite possibly outside the top 20. The real draft-day difference-maker for the Eagles on April 28 2022 will be their own pick—provided the team doesn't win seven or eight meaningless games that drops them outside the top 10.

By the end of the 2021 season the Eagles will know if Hurts is a long-term answer under center. If he is the team will have a boatload of draft capital to use to add impact players around him. If he isn't Philadelphia will be well positioned to select his successor whether it's with its own pick or by packaging it and one of the other firsts.

After spending the 2021 offseason in salary-cap hell due to the Wentz trade the Eagles will also be in much better shape in free agency next year. Per Over the Cap the Eagles presently sit $20.7 million under the projected cap in 2022. That number could easily bloom to over $50 million by cutting some aging veterans like Slay and defensive tackle Fletcher Cox and/or reworking some deals. Safety Anthony Harris and tight end Dallas Goedert are the only prominent free agents the team should actively try to bring back.

Al Drago/Associated Press

In other words it's not difficult to imagine a scenario where the 2022 Eagles could realistically be in position to compete for a division title—as opposed to this year's fantasy.

This isn't to say that the Eagles should go into full-on tank mode because of course no NFL team would ever do that. Or that Roseman should conduct a veteran fire sale a la the 2019 Dolphins (although if some team comes along with a Laremy Tunsil-esque offer for a guy like Andre Dillard it's at least worth considering).

But the best thing the Eagles can do in 2021 is shift the focus toward 2022. Look to the future even if it means a sacrifice or two in the present.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vZW4ubWVyY29wcmVzcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yOS9maWZhLWJyaWJlcy1zY2FuZGFsLXN3aXNzLWJhbmstYWdyZWVzLXdpdGgtdXMtanVzdGljZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LXRvLXBheS11cy03OS03LW1pbGxpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FIFA bribes scandal: Swiss bank agrees with US Justice Department to pay US$ 797 million,"FIFA bribes scandal: Swiss bank agrees with US Justice Department to pay US$ 797 million

Swiss bank Julius Bär has agreed to pay US$79.7 million in a settlement with the US Department of Justice after being implicated in a sprawling corruption probe surrounding FIFA world football’s governing body.

Julius Bär has entered a three-year deferred prosecution agreement to resolve accusations it engaged in a money-laundering conspiracy.

The agreement includes a US$ 43.3 million criminal fine and a US$ 36.4 million forfeiture. It was accepted by US District Judge Pamela Chen at a hearing in Brooklyn New York.

Switzerland’s third-largest private bank has said it has cooperated with the Justice Department since 2015.It has also said it has upgraded its compliance controls and dismissed some clients.

The US Justice Department unveiled the FIFA probe in April 2015. More than 40 defendants including football and marketing executives were charged and at least 30 have pleaded guilty.

In June 2017 former Julius Bär banker Jorge Arzuaga pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge for helping an Argentine sports marketing executive pay bribes to the president of Argentina’s football federation who was a FIFA vice president. Arzuaga was sentenced in November to probation.

Swiss financial regulator FINMA has also imposed penalties for Julius Bär’s anti-money laundering shortfalls ordering the bank to improve its controls and appoint an auditor. FINMA also reprimanded two former chief executives.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50d2luY2l0aWVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzI5L2NoYXJsZXktd2FsdGVycy1kYW5pZWxsZS1odW50ZXJzLWNvbnRyYWN0LWRpc3B1dGUtd2l0aC12aWtpbmdzLW5vdC1leGFjdGx5LWFhcm9uLXJvZGdlcnMtbGlrZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Charley Walters: Danielle Hunter's contract dispute with Vikings not exactly Aaron Rodgers-like,"It’s unclear how the Green Bay Packers-Aaron Rodgers saga will end.

The Vikings with Hunter rushing from the edge this season? Perhaps 10-7. Without him? Try 7-10.

The Vikings should be able to adjust Hunter’s undervalued contract considering the NFL has $113 billion — that’s billion not million — coming in new media deals beginning next year.

Now comes word from Forbes that Taylor had an all-cash offer to sell the Wolves for $1.4 billion but instead opted to sell to Lore and Rodriguez. Why? Because it would allow Taylor to remain controlling partner for two years. The $1.4 billion cash offer is no longer on the table.

“Clearly public safety is on the mind of a lot of our fans” Twins president Dave St. Peter said Wednesday. “But the reality of it is we survey our fans and talk to fans about how they feel once they come to the games and upwards of about 95 percent of those fans say they feel safe coming into the ballpark parking what have you.

“Yeah there are some real public safety challenges for our downtown. But the perceptions of those challenges are far worse than the reality in our mind. We have a role; we built a downtown ballpark. It’s not realistic to play all day games. We do need to play night games.

“And frankly we’re trying to lead we’re trying to reinvigorate our downtown. One of the ways we can do that is bringing back large scale events like Twins baseball. Employees coming back downtown over the next several months will be another big part of that.

“So we tend to believe that Twins baseball at Target Field remains a very safe endeavor for all fans. And those fans who have chosen to come out are experiencing that.”

Besides increasing his season total to $796926 Merritt advanced 22 spots to No. 114 in FedEx Cup standings. The top 125 advance to FedEx playoffs that begin in August with first-place prize money of $15 million from a total fund of $60 million.

That was Casey Danielson of the noted Osceola Wis. golfing family winning the other day on the Symetra Tour the official developmental tour of the LPGA. Danielson ranks sixth on the tour’s money list with $36762 after seven events.

The Twins will honor their 1991 World Series champions with a 30th anniversary on Aug. 14 before their game against Tampa Bay./l

DON’T PRINT THAT

Wild owner Craig Leipold says he has no regrets about the $98 million 13-year contracts he gave to Zach Parise and Ryan Suter. Those deals each have four years left.

“The signing of both Ryan and Zach were great signings; they changed our team significantly from both a financial standpoint and from a ticket sales and culture standpoint” Leipold said. “I would do the whole thing over again. It was going to be basically $100 million per player; the longer we made the contract the more you could divide by 100 so that’s how we got the cap number to $7.5 million for both of them.”

Does the owner expect both players to play out their contracts?

“I don’t know. That’ll be up to them” he said.

Research on Wild coach Dean Evason shows that on Jan. 7 1986 playing for the Hartford Whalers against the Calgary Flames Evason scored a hat trick. But he also received a five-minute penalty and 10-minute misconduct for a fight with Calgary’s Doug Risebrough who eventually would become the Wild’s GM.

There’s buzz now that Kevin Garnett who is said to be worth more than $200 million will be heavily involved in the Timberwolves basketball department if he joins franchise investors Alex Rodriguez and Marc Lore if/when they gain full control in 2023. The word is Garnett the ex-Timberwolf wants the franchise to remain in Minnesota but Rodriguez wants to move it to Seattle where he played for seven seasons.

Full NHL playoff shares for Wild players losing in seven games to Las Vegas could amount to about $15000 apiece.

New Utah men’s basketball coach Craig Smith who was a serious candidate for the Gophers job that went to Ben Johnson is highly involved with 6-8 Steffon Mitchell the former Shakopee star who is transferring from Boston College.

Gophers athletes could find out on July 1 whether they can be paid for their names images and likeness by corporate sponsors.

The Twins’ playoff odds dropped from 64 percent before the season to nine percent on Friday according to fivethirtyeight.com statistical analysis which projects the team to finish with a 77-85 record and six percent chance to win their division.

Wei-Long Hsu last weekend received a check for $195000 for winning the LPGA Pure Silk Championship. At the same time Tim Mickelson who caddied for brother Phil in winning the PGA Championship is expected to get more than $200000 from Phil’s $2.16 million prize.

Members of Southview Country Club raised more than $10000 to help defray expenses for their 17-year-old Isabella McCauley’s competition in the U.S. Women’s Open golf championship this week at the posh Olympic Club in San Francisco. Other Twin Cities clubs including Minneapolis North Oaks and Minikahda with layouts similar to that of the Olympic Club contributed their courses for practice.

McCauley who left for San Francisco on Saturday is scheduled to play practice rounds at Olympic with Sarah Burnham on Monday and Amy Olson on Tuesday of the LPGA Tour.

With Troy Vincent apparently pulling out of consideration it looks like Sean Frazier who was Barry Alvarez’s deputy a.d. at Wisconsin before taking the a.d. job at Northern Illinois is frontrunner to succeed Alvarez as a.d. at Wisconsin.

Among those rumored for the job is former Gophers interim a.d. Beth Goetz the a.d. at Ball State.

No doubt fiery late Herb Brooks would have gone ballistic over granddaughter Oliva Paradise and her University of St. Thomas women’s tennis team’s program elimination by the school which could lead to a Title IX lawsuit if not reinstated.

Meanwhile the university is in the midst of hiring some 40 assorted athletics assistants for its move to Division I.

Bud Grant 94 who says he’s been associated with University of Minnesota athletics for 77 years has a video out promoting reinstatement of the Gophers men’s tennis program which is being eliminated for so-called budget reasons.

Twins third baseman Josh Donaldson 35 with a guaranteed $92 million four-year contract is batting .227 in 38 games.

The number of American Legion baseball teams in Minnesota has reached a record high 372 this year. Except for last year (due to COVID-19) the Minnesota American Legion has held a state tournament annually since 1926. Tournaments this year begin in July at various locations.

Gophers athletics director Mark Coyle is paid nearly $1 million a year under his current contract which runs through 2026. Ohio State a.d. Gene Smith’s recent new deal that also runs through 2026 is worth $2 million annually.

The NCAA Women’s Final Four basketball tournament will be April 1 and April 3 at Target Center where local fans hope UConn star Paige Bueckers from Hopkins makes it a homecoming. NCAA VP for women’s basketball Lynn Holzman will do a Dunkers Zoom meeting about the tournament on June 24./l

Drivers who were eager to set their own schedules signed up in droves propelling the gig economy into a multibillion-dollar industry.

But some drivers never received the control and independence they had expected. They struggled with the costs of vehicle maintenance loans and insurance and they questioned whether Uber and Lyft paid a fair wage. Legislative efforts to grant them employment benefits were thwarted.

Nevada governor lifts ban on surge pricing,"Associated Press

LAS VEGAS — Uber and Lyft will be able to resume surge pricing in Las Vegas and the rest of Nevada after Gov. Steve Sisolak late Friday ended a ban meant to prevent price gouging during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Democratic governor's emergency order took effect immediately.

App-based ride-hailing firms known formally as transportation network companies generally raise their prices during periods of high demand which they say reduces wait times by encouraging more drivers to work.

But that’s been banned during the public health emergency declared in March 2020.

Uber said last month that the loss of surge pricing led to a shortage of drivers because it depressed their earnings and it urged users to pressure Sisolak to ease the restriction.

Marijuana delivery has attracted interest from companies as big as Uber but a combination of low margins and legislative regulatory and banking restrictions make the business a tough one. Mario Tama | Getty Images News | Getty Images

The delivery wars could be headed to cannabis dispensaries next. Throughout the pandemic food orders boomed for DoorDash  UberEats and Grubhub . Sales on alcohol delivery app Drizly surged. And then there is California-based cannabis delivery app Eaze which saw new customer sign ups increase by over 70%. The company calculates that last year in California a marijuana order was placed every eight seconds. More than $17 billion in sales was generated from the U.S. legal market led by California in 2020 according to research firm BDSA. Eaze is backed by Snoop Dogg has 800000 customers and has made over 7 million deliveries in California since its launch in 2014 but it isn't the only player in the space. There are a handful of cannabis delivery options that serve the entire state and many more serving smaller regions. MedMen and Caliva offer delivery in California and across the country dispensaries offer their own delivery services directly to their community where it's legal to do so. Even where adult and recreational adult-use marijuana delivery is legal there's red tape. For one different states have different employment laws and product hand-off protocol for drivers. In California for example drivers must be W2 employees of dispensaries. There are also requirements for the delivery vehicles themselves: in California the vehicle must not be open like a scooter and in Massachusetts there are camera mandates. Despite the regulatory hurdles Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi recently suggested that his company could further evolve from ride-hailing to cannabis delivery. ""When the road is clear for cannabis when federal laws come into play we're absolutely going to take a look at it"" Khosrowshahi said in a recent CNBC ""Tech Check"" interview.

Uber's first acquisition of substance

For now Uber is focused on food with UberEats and with its Drizly acquisition its first foray into regulated substances: alcohol. Drizly sister company Lantern handles cannabis delivery. Lantern was incubated within Drizly but when the Uber-Drizly deal closes the cannabis delivery app will become an independent subsidiary. Lantern was the first to launch adult-use cannabis delivery in Colorado in March. Lantern president Meredith Mahoney told CNBC via email ""We're excited that the march toward federal legalization is accelerating and that big delivery players like Uber are taking notice."" If M&A was Uber's answer to a booming alcohol delivery market could consolidation be on the cannabis menu? Perhaps says Eaze spokesman David Mack but regulation will still prove to be a significant challenge. One snag for consolidation could be laws limiting delivery of cannabis alongside alcohol or food. California a template for marijuana policy across the rest of the country prohibits delivery of cannabis with food or with alcohol. Entering the U.S. cannabis economy also means getting into a business tied to a drug steeped in racial inequality. With Black Americans 3.6 times more likely to get arrested for marijuana-related offenses than their white counterparts the playing field for legal cannabis is far from level. In fact rapper and mogul Jay-Z is leading The Parent Company's $10 million fund to support minority entrepreneurs in cannabis who may otherwise be left behind by the marijuana boom. The vertically integrated cannabis company where Jay-Z serves as chief visionary officer combined efforts in the sector from the artist and his entertainment agency ROC NATION Left Coast Ventures and direct-to-consumer cannabis brand Caliva. The Parent Company went public in Canada via a SPAC earlier this year trading on the NEO Exchange. Delivery apps could eliminate costs associated with setting up storefronts and simultaneously offer exposure for women- and minority-owned brands. Eaze offers a ""social equity"" menu for Black-owned local stores and dispensaries and claims the feature helps boost interest and revenue for brands that appear there. Plenty of delivery apps and logistics companies could enter the cannabis delivery space. Logistics and delivery app Gopuff despite its name and its origins ferrying snacks and supplies across a college campus does not deliver marijuana. The app-based company which ranked No. 36 on this year's Disruptor 50 list delivers alcohol and smoking accessories like rolling trays and papers in over 600 American cities but Gopuff has no plans to add cannabis products to its platform according to the company. It did buy BevMo! a chain of 300 bricks-and-mortar liquor stores on the West Coast late last year. And Uber and Gopuff recently announced a delivery partnership for ""essential"" items.

Cannabis distribution and logistics

Hip hop artist and original Dipset member Jim Jones recognized the barriers to delivery entry for his own cannabis company Saucey Farms & Extracts and last Tuesday announced a partnership with The Parent Company to manage distribution and manufacturing in California. ""We're a small to mid-sized business so distribution isn't something that we'd normally be capable of providing on our own"" says Jones. ""I fully anticipate that similar businesses will follow suit in the coming months and years"" Jones wrote to CNBC in a text message. One of those businesses could be FastAF a last mile logistics and delivery platform like Gopuff albeit smaller and in fewer markets. FastAF is not currently offering cannabis products even though it like Gopuff operates in weed-friendly California.

FastAF operates like an online boutique partnering with brands like Goop Aesop and Nike. It already sells CBD products and cannabis accessories and Lee Hnetinka founder and CEO of FastAF's parent company Darkstore says they see strong demand in both categories. FastAF plans to break into regulated products with alcohol delivery soon but a few barriers remain when it comes to cannabis. One is the discrepancy across jurisdictions: ""When we're ready to go to market with cannabis we want to put all of our weight behind it. We look to carry our partner brands in every one of our markets"" Hnetinka said. For Hnetinka the other barrier arguably the larger one is payments.

Marijuana crime and cash

Marijuana has been legalized to varying degrees in 35 states but since sale distribution and possession remain illegal federally U.S. banks face risks in doing business with the cannabis industry. According to the American Bankers Association any money that can be traced back to a marijuana-related business could be considered money laundering. In fact cannabis banking is such a problem that Eaze's ex-CEO left the company and pled guilty to conspiring to bank fraud as part of a scheme to deceive banks into processing over $100 million of marijuana purchase payments. As a result the green business is mostly a cash business. However for the year 2020 the U.S. Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) reported 684 banks and credit unions providing banking services to marijuana-related businesses. FinCEN documented over 170000 Suspicious Activity Reports related to banking in the industry but more than three-quarters of them were about institutions found to be compliant with the appropriate state's regulations regarding marijuana businesses. Still it's tricky; state-by-state policy specifics complicate and stunt the industry's growth. For lawmakers that's where the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act comes in. The bill which is currently sitting with the Senate after being passed by the U.S. House would provide a safe harbor for institutions providing banking services to marijuana-related businesses. Accounting firm Elliot Davis pointed out in a 2020 analysis that the bill won't protect card networks from federal prosecution so even with Senate approval the SAFE Act leaves cannabis businesses still largely cash-reliant. Cowen Research expects the cannabis industry to generate $85 billion in U.S. sales by 2030. In New York alone cannabis could generate $350 million a year in tax revenue and up to 60000 new jobs according to Governor Cuomo's estimates. California's total revenue from cannabis since January 2018 is $1.8 billion and cannabis delivery app Eaze says that delivery comprises 10%-15% of the state's legal market. The key to a robust delivery market and multiple players according to Eaze spokesman Mack is legalization legislation that envisions delivery as part of a state's cannabis business.

Federal legalization and President Biden

Cannabis is still federally considered a Schedule I drug on par with heroin and ecstasy in what the DEA deems a ""high potential for abuse."" Even if a store or dispensary is operating legally in its home state transporting cannabis across state lines still violates the law. As a result each jurisdiction's weed ecosystem exists in a silo and delivery players face yet another barrier: setting up in a new state means virtually setting up from scratch with a new network of suppliers and delivery services as well as a new regulatory framework to navigate. National legalization would eliminate most of the barriers to entry for cannabis and in particular cannabis delivery. But President Biden hasn't pushed for a review of the laws that criminalized marijuana in the first place and GLJ Research's Gordon Johnson says that a rally earlier this year in the publicly traded cannabis space including the Alternative Harvest ETF and cannabis stock Tilray  was fueled by faith that the Biden would by now have done more on the cannabis issues. Johnson says if Biden doesn't sign an Executive Order decriminalizing descheduling or rescheduling marijuana the industry's only regulatory hope sits with the SAFE Banking Act or with whatever legislation New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer presents. A move to deschedule the drug would be a boon for investor interest and capital but it's still a risky venture. Johnson has a $0 price target on Tilray and sees little hope for the industry in the long run betting marijuana remains a low gross margin business with troubling economics. Eaze's bumpy financial journey reflects some of Johnson's concerns about the ""green rush"" of cannabis investments. Last year Techcrunch reported on financial challenges at Eaze and a subsequent business pivot in an effort to grow margins.

The Uber and Lyft apps were barren. Public transit had shuttered for the evening. Wang eventually snagged one of the taxis trickling in every five minutes leaving behind some two dozen other passengers stranded in the fluorescent glow of the vacant taxi stand.

When Peter Wang landed around midnight at Logan Airport last week for his first business trip since early 2020 his seatmate offered up some advice: Order your Uber now. Wang looked around. The seat-belt light was still on. He thanked the local for her tip but decided to wait until he deplaned to open the ride-hailing app.

To those who rely on ride-hailing apps to get around Boston Wang’s story likely comes as no surprise. As the newly vaccinated masses venture out into the world again they have found readily available Ubers and Lyfts to be a pre-pandemic memory. Local riders and drivers alike agree that current demand far outpaces supply.

Ride-hailing companies are grappling with a nationwide shortage of drivers. The number of US-based drivers logging into Uber during the first three months of 2021 was down 37.5 percent year over year according to data from Apptopia a Boston-based market intelligence service. Lyft saw a 42.3 percent drop over the same period.

Nowhere is the problem more acute than in Boston. The average wait time for an Uber in Boston this spring is 40 percent longer than in Philadelphia and 147 percent longer than in New York City according to a company spokesman. Lyft did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

“Extreme sports — getting an Uber in Boston” wrote one Twitter user in mid-May.

Perhaps the most obvious culprit for the shortage is a 2016 Massachusetts law that bans surge pricing during states of emergency. Without the incentive of that added revenue drivers see little point in hitting the streets during rush hour or thunderstorms and on weekend nights.

Lawmakers instituted the ban to protect MBTA riders from outrageous Uber and Lyft fares after the notorious February snowstorm of 2015 shut down public transit. But drivers argue that there is a major difference between a blizzard — a transient hardship — and a 16-month pandemic.

“The demand has completely returned to a pre-COVID level and the drivers just aren’t there” said Jake Irmitir who began working as an Uber driver again in August when his unemployment assistance ended. “Being a driver right now means you’re making like a third of what you used to make because of no surge pricing.”

The Baker administration has introduced legislation to modify the blanket ban on surge pricing in an effort to “increase the supply of drivers which reduces wait times and ensures reliable transportation options.” The third and most recent bill was filed in April but has not yet been taken up by the Legislature. Massachusetts is one of just two states that have imposed such a ban.

Still even the ride-hailing companies recognize the reintroduction of surge pricing alone won’t solve the driver shortage plaguing cities across the country. Much of their driver base filed for unemployment when the country shut down last spring. And in a dilemma that mirrors that of the restaurant industry many drivers realized that their unemployment checks eclipsed what they often earned driving especially after deducting car expenses and gas prices which are currently at a seven-year high.

Others switched to driving for food delivery services according to Beth Griffith executive director of the Boston Independent Drivers Guild. Gone were the lengthy rides with drunk reckless customers and the out-of-pocket tolls necessary for an airport pickup. Those without child care could even take their kids along for deliveries when needed.

COVID-19 concerns have also held some back. Felipe Martinez a full-time driver who has diabetes and has two young children stopped driving last March to protect himself and care for his kids. Today as Massachusetts opens up he is one of several area drivers torn between a fear of the vaccine and a fear of the virus.

“Rideshares are mostly a Black brown and immigrant workforce and there is this mistrust of the government that is keeping a lot of drivers off the roads because they don’t want to get the vaccine” said Griffith.

Despite Massachusetts’ reputation as a vaccination powerhouse the state’s Latino and Black populations still remain under-vaccinated. Roughly 60 percent of Uber drivers identify as non-white according to several surveys conducted across the nation.

Those drivers who have returned to the roads told the Globe that they’ve encountered the same festering labor issues that existed before the pandemic. Drivers said that at best one out of 10 riders tips and traffic has roared closer to its hellish pre-pandemic norm. Uber recently unveiled a $250 million stimulus package aimed at welcoming back existing drivers and recruiting new ones with small bonuses.

“As more people are getting vaccinated and moving around riders in Massachusetts are using the Uber app more. That’s why we have temporarily boosted earnings for Uber drivers to encourage them to drive with us” said Uber spokesperson Alix Anfang in a statement.

But drivers emphasized to the Globe that the incentives offered through the initiative are merely temporary and not retroactive meaning the few who have been anchoring the service over the past few months will not benefit.

“I drove through the winter and they decreased my incentives while offering former drivers practically free money! That’s my reward for providing service through one of the riskiest times of the year” wrote one Boston driver who asked to remain anonymous for this story for fear of reprisals by Uber and Lyft.

This feeling of expendability has long been an issue for ride-hailing companies that have fought tooth and nail against making full-time drivers employees while still relying on them for a disproportionate amount of revenue. The companies are tight-lipped about how many drivers work over 32 hours a week but a July 2020 study by Seattle researchers revealed that a third drive full time in the city accounting for 55 percent of trips.

“We just get hit around like the kid on the playground getting beat up by a bully” said Stephen Levine of Lynn who started driving for Uber full time in 2015 at a base rate of $1.24 per mile. That same rate has since decreased to 66 cents.

It may not happen overnight but local drivers envision the balance tipping back in the rider’s favor in the coming months as new drivers enticed by temporary incentives join and the state of emergency ends on June 15.

Historically the summer months are the worst for ride-hailing drivers who rely on Boston’s college students to sustain them. The mass exodus of these students creates a saturation of drivers said Griffith.

“Some go down to the Cape where there is less competition and essentially live out of their car and use a gym membership to shower in order to earn a living wage” she said.

And while the phenomenon of hitchhiking CEOs may disappear the fraught relationship between ride-hailing companies their drivers and the state will not particularly with more attention paid to labor practices among tech behemoths. Baker may double down on his efforts to increase five-fold the state’s surcharge on ride-hailing companies using the revenue to fund public transit. Lyft and Uber argue that it is not their responsibility to plug state budget holes and the surcharge would lead to an increase in rider fares without a pay increase for drivers.

“The state considered us essential employees in the pandemic and the city buckling without us now shows just how essential we are” said Levine. “But it’s a very hard situation we are in with little light at the end of the tunnel. Until we are protected by law we can’t really celebrate anything.”

Mented Cosmetics Lip Gloss Mented Cosmetics Lip Gloss $15 at Ulta Beauty

“With summer I’m leaning towards brighter and bolder colors” says Kwarteng. “I like to have fun with colors but I wouldn’t really do a bold eye and a bold lip. I’ll pick one and keep the other more neutral.” For this look she chose to make her lips the standout star. Makeup artist Grace Pae dabbed on Ulta Beauty Collection Luxe Lipstick in Raspberry Beret which acts as a light stain layered under Mented Lip Gloss in #1 Cran creating just enough tint to keep the look fresh and bright. “I love this lip gloss because it’s super pigmented so you don’t have to layer it over and over and over again to get [the color to show up]” says Kwarteng.

“This is the perfect look for summer because it’s easy clean and the hair is out of the face while protecting your delicate curls from breakage” explains Thomas. For summer Kwarteng plans to do a lot of protective styles like brands and twists and maybe even add a little color. “I’ve had pink braids in the past” she says. “Being playful and fun is something that I’m really excited about. I had never really played with my natural hair before quarantine because I always had it tucked under protective styles. There was a process and trial of testing different things—some worked some didn’t. I found a lot of joy in that.”

I am not a drugstore beauty person. I have a small arsenal of luxe products that I am extremely devoted to and have ignored the cosmetics aisle ever since my Bonne Bell days. Yet here I am recommending the epitome of drugstore glamour: press-on nails.

How did we get here? Deep into the pandemic I met up with a friend who had an impeccable manicure.

""Where did you go?!"" I demanded acutely aware of my own naked nails that had not seen the inside of a salon in over a year. She told me that they were press-on nails not anything fancy just a pack of Impress that runs about $9 at Walgreens and other drugstores (each pack has 30 nails which is good for at least two manicures). I rushed out to get my own and within 15 minutes I had a manicure to rival my pre-pandemic nails and felt the responsibility to spread the gospel far and wide.

These are not the plastic claws of yore. Today's press-ons are thin and come in sophisticated nudes and classic reds as well as fun designs like marble stripes and glitter. They solve the problem of having streaky pale polish (personal pet peeve) and let you experiment with wild prints for a one-off event. Crucially the nails can be trimmed and filed making them completely natural looking. To apply prep your nails as you would for any manicure (wash hands push down cuticles etc.) clean the nail with the provided wipe or rubbing alcohol then peel and stick. Lastly trim and file to your desired length and you are done within a few minutes no drying or setting needed. I kid you not. Removal generally involves soaking the nails in warm soapy water or oil and then gently prying them off. There is little to no damage to your natural nail.

Mine routinely last for two weeks even through regular nail-destroying activities like washing dishes and opening cans. I have lost a nail or two but can pop on a new one on in one minute flat. On a recent two-week trip I threw the pack into my carry-on and kept my nails in tip top shape—look TSA no liquids! My sister a flight attendant and new mom applied hers last-minute in the crew room (note she just filed them no nail clippers in public please).

My two favorite brands are Impress for its easy availability and collaboration with OPI—with tried-and-true colors like Lincoln Park After Dark Cajun Shrimp and Bubble Bath—and Dashing Diva which has a slightly better fit and a wider variety of designs. Since I trim and file all of mine to be short and oval I ignore the length and shape of the press-ons (unless they have decorative tips) and simply reshape them on my nail. I've also experimented with a little nail art which I normally wouldn't bother to play around with in a salon. Last-minute party invitation? A long-deserved vacation? Pop open a pack of press-ons because if we ever deserved a summer of perfect nails this is the one."

The original Trustees were the governors of the colony of Georgia a group appointed by England’s King George II in 1732 that operated under a Latin motto translated as “Not for self but for others.” The “Trustees” term was revived in 2008 by GHS for an annual award at a gala that follows the Georgia History Festival an educational program for K-12 students.

The “Georgia Trustee” award according to GHS is “a way of recognizing modern-day Georgians whose accomplishments and community service reflect the high ideals of the founding body of Trustees.” Honorees have largely been corporate and institutional leaders along with such figures as baseball great Hank Aaron University of Georgia football coach Vince Dooley and former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn.

Abney is also a former chair of the Metro Atlanta Chamber and past executive chairman of the board for Sandy Springs-based UPS.

Baranco and her husband Gregory co-founded Buckhead-based car dealerships that were among the first owned by an African American woman. She continues to act as executive vice president and chief operating officer of the business. Baranco is also an attorney who previously served as a Georgia assistant attorney general. She is a former chair of the Georgia Board of Regents which oversees the state university system and has served on many corporate boards.

Gov. Brian Kemp will induct Abney and Baranco into the “Georgia Trustee” list at a June 5 8 p.m. ceremony that will be shown on the GHS YouTube channel and Public Broadcasting Atlanta.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vdmlkZW8vd2F0Y2gtMTQwdGgtcGFzc2luZy1wYXJhZGUtbmF0aW9uYWwtMDg1NDI2MDc5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch: 140th passing out parade of National Defence Academy,"Wall Street indexes were back in sight of record highs following a selloff last month as a slew of economic data pointed to cooling labor market momentum raising expectations that the Fed will cut borrowing costs more than once this year.

Companies in Japan spend plenty on information and communications technology (ICT) but get less bang for the yen. Japan ranks 56th in ‘business agility’ which measures how well a country uses ICT.

Most Japanese companies use ICT primarily to cut costs by automating tasks they are already doing like inventory control. But what makes ICT revolutionary is that companies can do things that were previously impossible. They can not only reach more customers and suppliers via e-commerce but also use big data and the internet to develop new products and improve old ones. UPS parcel delivery trucks have internal sensors to monitor conditions that typically precede a part breaking down avoiding expensive failures of trucks filled with parcels.

Using ICT should enable the rest of the economy — distribution services and non-ICT manufacturing — to increase productivity and get for instance a 2 per cent increase in output from a 1 per cent hike in inputs. Unfortunately Japan’s non-ICT sectors have not enjoyed this productivity boost. During Japan’s ‘economic miracle’ following the Second World War in the analogue era technological innovation was led by giant capital-intensive and vertically integrated companies. They relied solely upon themselves and long-time allies in corporate conglomerates — known as keiretsu — to create distinct products. Companies moulded themselves to conform to this technological regime.

But we now live in a digital world where the vanguards of innovation are often newer entrepreneurial and knowledge-intensive companies. It is a world where giants regularly partner with others including newcomers in a process called ‘open innovation’. Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine was developed by a small German biotechnology firm founded in 2008 called BioNTech. Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Android and Chrome are all products developed through open innovation.

In Japan 70 per cent of corporate giants still believe that they must do everything in-house. However with 10 per cent of a car’s manufacturing cost involving software — and with that amount steadily increasing with time — automakers can no longer go it alone. Having repeatedly failed to develop a collision-avoidance system on its own Honda finally bought technology from Bosch only to face outrage from the company’s research and development veterans who insist that using homegrown parts was central to ‘Honda’s soul’.

Analogue era champions were so successful that they have an ingrained a mindset which companies find hard to change — even when they try hard. These firms do not hire or promote recruits who are eager to revamp business models. Around 82 per cent of senior managers in Japan’s leading corporations have never worked in another firm. In Germany that share is 28 per cent and in the United States just 19 per cent.

The difficulty of teaching an old dog new tricks is hardly unique to Japan but what differentiates it is the difficulty new firms face in supplanting past corporate leaders. Not a single new manufacturer has entered the top ranks of electronics since 1946 when Sony and Casio were born. By contrast 8 of the top 21 electronics hardware manufacturers in the United States did not exist in 1970. Among rich countries Japan has the second-lowest rate of new firms entering and old firms exiting.

In the digital era bigger is not necessarily better. Back in 1981 71 per cent of all business research and development in the United States was carried out by firms with at least 25000 employees and just 4 per cent by those with fewer than 1000. By 2014 the share of giant firms halved to just 36 per cent while the share of those with less than 1000 increased to 20 per cent.

Japan resists this trend. In 2015 only 7 per cent of its research and development was conducted by firms with fewer than 500 employees compared to 17 per cent in the United States and 33 per cent in France and the United Kingdom. One reason is that Tokyo directs almost 90 per cent of the government’s financial aid for research and development to large incumbents — the highest ratio in the OECD.

Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has announced a program to increase digitisation including the creation of a new digitisation agency. It is a good first step but one unfortunately limited to intra-governmental functions and citizens’ dealings with the government. If it is to be helpful to Japan’s economy it needs to be extended to business.

If Japan wants to revive it has to recognise that to paraphrase the famous American car commercial ‘This is not your father’s economy’. Its analogue era champions are holding Japan’s economy back.

She was nervous and anxious all morning at the thought of Alexander Rossi visiting her home.

Finally at 12:30 p.m. he arrived at the home located just off Main Street in Speedway and opened the door of the AES 500 Festival Event car. Her emotions switched from nervous to excited at the sight of her favorite NTT INDYCAR SERIES driver at her home.

“I was so excited when I got the call that he was coming” she said. “That was just cool. The house just started off with the flags across the top of the house and then we just went crazy. I thought ‘Well we’re just going to call it flags and flowers.’ It ended up being beautiful. We’re thrilled that we were selected and that our favorite driver came.”

2016 Indy 500 winner Rossi burst out of the car with a wide smile on his face as a group of people cheered for his arrival.

“You all don’t live in this house” he quipped. “This is awesome. It’s so cool. I’m really excited to see everyone.”

Rossi spent time in Konrad’s yard talked with race fans about the 500 Spectacle of Homes his chances in the Indianapolis 500 and even qualifying last weekend which his fans told him they spent the last few minutes anxiously waiting for Rossi to get another chance at making the Firestone Fast Nine Shootout. He didn’t and he will start 10th in the 105th Running of the Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge (11 a.m. ET live on NBC).

Several kids wearing No. 27 NAPA AUTO PARTS / AutoNation apparel came up in the yard and nervously stood near him. When Rossi noticed he broke conversation and immediately posed for photos and signed autographs – T-shirts hats flags everything.

It was a relaxing few minutes for the athlete who will strap into his race car in less than 24 hours and compete for 500 miles of glory. For a period of time Alexander Rossi the race car driver was just Alexander Rossi chatting with friends.

Drivers were spread all throughout Central Indiana visiting race fans in the Town of Speedway Herron-Morton Place Carmel Brownsburg Fishers Whitestown and more in the surrounding Indianapolis area.

Aside from their visit race fans also received special gift bags that included Mountain Dew and IMS gear such as a backpack coozies an Indianapolis 500 program masks and more.

Graham Rahal who starts 18th in the No. 15 United Rentals Honda for Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing in Sunday’s race visited Suzanne Boatright in Brownsburg and was honored by Boatright’s passion for the Racing Capital of the World and the signs that little kids in attendance made for him.

“It’s good to have everybody come back” Rahal told the race fans. “Last year was not right. It was very quiet. Very strange. I appreciate (the support).”

This was the payoff of the 500 Spectacle of Homes hosted by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and INDYCAR on Saturday May 29. All month long race fans from across the world decorated their yards and homes in race-themed fashion to celebrate the Indy 500.

“After moving here last year we were thrilled that Roger Penske bought the track knowing that big changes were coming” said Konrad a lifelong Indy 500 fan. “And then the pandemic hit so we just waited a whole year for this to come back around. It’s just been a great week and a great month.”

On Saturday the field of 33 drivers competing in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” accompanied by a AES 500 Festival board member and two 500 Festival princesses left IMS and made their way in parade formation down Main Street in Speedway to thank all the local businesses and fans for their support.

Then they made their way to Monument Circle in downtown Indianapolis for a brief ceremony where they heard special messages from the race’s three four-time winners: A.J. Foyt Al Unser and Rick Mears as well as remarks from Allison Melangton senior vice president of Penske Entertainment.

The event was built off last year’s Speedway 33 when all 33 drivers in the field for the 104th Indianapolis 500 visited longtime ticketholders near the racetrack to thank them for their support. It was also a substitute for the AES 500 Festival Parade which was canceled this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We do miss the traditional AES 500 Festival Parade so much today and we look forward to its return in 2022” Melangton said. “It’s so fantastic to see so many homes decorated to celebrate the long-lasting traditions of the Indianapolis 500. It reminds us all how much this race means to the community every year in Indianapolis.”

The cost of housing in Rhode Island is becoming ever more expensive and outpacing wage growth and inflation. While data indicates Rhode Island's economy is floundering research shows the employment situation not only the worst in New England and the state's recovery is the worst in the country.

Both rents and the cost of purchasing a home are soaring upward.

While housing prices have skyrocketed across the country Rhode Island is seeing costs rise at a record pace.

For April the Rhode Island Association of Realtors reported an all-time high in Rhode Island’s monthly median sales price of single-family homes. April’s median price was $349000 an 18.1 percent gain over April of 2020.

Not only are the costs of homes increasing but they are also selling at a record pace.

Homes across the country sold even faster in the 50 largest U.S. metros at 34 days on average down from 50 in April 2020.

In Providence it is just 28 days on the market.

Not only is the cost of purchasing a home increasing but the cost of renting is increasing at an unmatched rate. While in some cities the cost of renting dropped over the past year Providence saw increases in many key factors.

Data released this week shows that rents in Providence increased 3.8% month-over-month compared to 2.3% nationally according to Apartment List.

According to another real estate research group Zumper the cost of a rental of a one-bedroom apartment rose 6.4% over the past year. Zumper finds that the cost of a rental of a two-bedroom dropped by 4%.

And while rental costs in Providence were overall increasing the cost of renting in Boston fell by 11% for a one-bedroom and 10% for a two-bedroom.

Providence now is the 17th most expensive city for rental costs in the United States with the median cost of a one-bedroom at $1400 and $1660 for a two-bedroom according to Zumper.

The increasing cost of housing creates an even larger issue as the overall economy continues to struggle.

According to multiple reports in the past two weeks Rhode Island's economy is struggling to recover and trails the rest of the region and some reports rank it for key measures at the bottom in the United States.

The Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council reported that ""RI’s GDP is projected to have grown by 3.5 percent (annualized rate) in Q1 but New England’s GDP is projected to have expanded by 5.2 percent and U.S. GDP is forecasted to have grown by 6.4 percent in the same period. Rhode Island’s “growth gap” which existed before the pandemic only widened over the last year.""

RIPEC also cites that Rhode Island's job recovery is the worst in the region.

This week Wall Street 24/7 ranked Rhode Island's economic recovery #37 in the United States.

Wall Street 24/7 writes ""Rhode Island is one of several Northeastern states with struggling economies. The coronavirus pandemic not only took a greater than average public health toll on the state it also sent unemployment soaring. There are over 36000 fewer people working in Rhode Island than there were a year ago and the jobless rate stands at 7.1% well above the 6.0% U.S. rate. Economic growth in Rhode Island has also been sluggish relative to much of the country. Due in part to falling output in industries like arts and entertainment and accommodation and food services Rhode Island’s economy has contracted at an average rate of 0.5% over the past half-decade.""

Another study ranks Rhode Island’s recovery of jobs from the coronavirus pandemic as 50th in the United States.

The study that includes the District of Columbia ranks Rhode Island second-worst in the country for “Recovered Most Since Start of COVID-19 Crisis” and second only to West Virginia in job recovery.

And in the shorter term Rhode Island ranks last #51 for job recovery in the past week.

While the cost of housing continues to rise in Rhode Island the economic recovery continues to struggle.

After being introduced to the school assembly there was a problem: it was clearly apparent that none of the children knew who on Earth he was.

""I'm not really sure they could have pointed to where Britain was on the map"" he admitted.

""And so finally in desperation I uttered the words 'David Beckham' and there was immediate ripple of recognition and you were away.

""A point of connection had been established.""

When the sun sets on Manchester tonight our finest football team may have been crowned the champions of Europe.

It's the final step to take in Manchester City's upward trajectory since the infusion of unprecedented financial power brought about by the 2008 Abu Dhabi United Group takeover.

The roadmap to this moment was surely accelerated too by the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford. Under his leadership it was Manchester United that hosted the biggest games throughout the 1990s and 2000s attracting the biggest stars along the way and ensuring the word Manchester was known throughout the world.

It's no wonder then that a British Prime Minister as a stranger in a strange land would resort to simply blurting out the name of one of Manchester United's stars to get the ball rolling and build rapport.

An unimageable shift in power from Red to Blue has taken place on the pitch since then however. It's no longer the heroes of Old Trafford who children around the world aspire to emulate.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's goal against Bayern Munich in 1999 has been usurped by Sergio Aguero as the modern moment known across the world for an iconic last-gasp winner. Manchester United's David Beckham used to be the most talented and exciting young British footballer - now it is unquestionably City's Phil Foden.

To analyse this ""new normal"" only becomes more surreal when you consider how it only feels like a heartbeat ago that City fans were watching their team slug it out in the third tier of English football and singing ""we’re not really here"" .

So for all but those Blues still in children-sized shirts being on the brink of European glory truly is dreamland.

But as Manchester City look to build their own ""point of connection"" - both globally with franchise teams in New York Melbourne Mumbai and more as well as in our own city - it remains a murky and contested picture.

In the football world many have had a problem with the 2008 takeover arguing that a club having access to the extreme wealth of a Middle Eastern Emirate is unfair.

City’s eye-watering spending on players and wages has skewed the playing field for everyone else they claim.

Supporters can justifiably counter that multi-million pound football deals began well before City and that the real gulf is between elite European clubs and the rest of the footballing pyramid.

The Abu Dhabi ownership has its critics off the pitch too.

(Image: Joel Goodman)

Manchester City is being used as an exercise in ‘sportswashing’ - allowing a nation with a history of human rights abuses to project a positive image of itself on the world stage it is argued.

Meanwhile an apparent ""all access"" Amazon Prime documentary produced with involvement from the club in 2018 failed to ask many tough questions.

Again it might be argued that the former oligarchs and debt-ridden owners at other football clubs are hardly without fault either.

But perhaps most significantly critics question Manchester’s increasingly close economic and political ties with Abu Dhabi.

Our council while struggling to tackle a housing crisis and pockets of the most entrenched poverty in the UK has entered into property deals with City’s owners that critics say have failed to deliver much benefit to those who need it most.

A national newspaper article in 2019 was headlined: ‘Manchester the city that sold out to Abu Dhabi’.

Is all this just the carping of jealous rivals? Is it fair to hold a super-rich football club responsible for deprivation that has been decades in the making?

Or could and should there be more scrutiny of Manchester’s relationship with City’s owners?

After 13 years the consequences of the Abu Dhabi revolution in Manchester are still not fully clear.

So with City on the edge of greatness and the European Super League debacle having sparked renewed debate around football club ownership the Manchester Evening News attempts to take a balanced look at what has been won and lost in that time.

‘When City play Real Madrid every hotel will be full’

Clearly the trophies in Manchester City’s cabinet are a testament to the footballing success of the Abu Dhabi ownership.

It took three years before the first City’s triumph in the 2011 FA Cup final but there has been steady progress since.

After five Premier League titles in ten years including three of the past four City are now unquestionably the dominant team in England.

Europe has proven a tougher nut to crack but after five seasons under Pep Guardiola the Blues have made it to the Champions League final and are favourites to beat Chelsea.

Add in a further six League Cup titles and this is by far the most successful era in City’s history.

And in terms of what it has meant to fans the numbers don’t tell half the story.

Sergio Aguero’s iconic goal to win the league in 2012 the demolitions of rivals Manchester United and Chelsea fantastic victories over ‘old money’ clubs like Real Madrid and Barcelona.

It is impossible to quantify the pure joy these moments have brought in a region where football is a religion for so many.

Businesses - large and small - can put a price on it however.

The rise of the Blues has helped cement Manchester’s status as arguably the most famous footballing city in the world.

The M.E.N reported last year how almost 30 new hotels are expected to be built by 2023 to accommodate the growth of tourism.

Adrian Ellis general manager of The Lowry Hotel and Chair of Manchester Hotelier's Association (MHA) described the expansion as 'unprecedented’.

Although Manchester has other pull factors - its musical reputation for example - football remains one of the biggest attractions.

“When Manchester City play Real Madrid at home in March you can pretty much be sure every hotel in the city will be full"" said Mr Ellis at the time.

Research from 2019 suggested City’s involvement in the title race with Liverpool was worth as much as £220m to Manchester’s economy.

Thinktank Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) said competing for a league title could increase a city’s economic growth by 1.1 percentage points due to spending on match-day tickets merchandise and hospitality.

The feelgood factor can also translate into higher local spending generally.

The CEBR said psychological research suggests that fans associate the performance of their chosen team with their own successes and failures which can have an impact on people’s dopamine levels and overall confidence.

City’s owners have also invested beyond playing staff and coaches to a level that is virtually unique in the Premier League.

The Etihad stadium itself is still owned by the council but City pay rent believed to be at least £4million a year.

The club are also responsible for all maintenance and investment and the owners have spent millions more in improving the playing surface corporate hospitality and expanding capacity to 55000.

Further expansion plans are still in the pipeline.

Despite their rapid growth in status City also have some of the most reasonably priced tickets in the Premier League with the cheapest season ticket costing £325 in 2019-20.

The club’s ‘City in the Community’ programme has seen thousands of hours invested in worthy causes including disability football teams and mental health support for vulnerable youngsters.

There is also the small matter of the £200m City Football Academy covering 80 acres beside the Etihad.

(Image: ABNM Photography)

The vast complex includes 16 outdoor pitches the 7000 capacity stadium used by City’s Elite Development Squad and Women sides residential and classroom space for youth players and 2000 mature trees.

City also donated 5.5 acres of land and at least £12million towards Beswick Leisure Centre the sixth form Connell college and the Manchester Institute of Health and Performance.

But what do those living in east Manchester think?

‘It doesn’t come out of my pocket... I don’t mind’

On Bellis Close in the shadow of the Etihad Gary Dyer 57 is helping his dad and lifelong City fan Chris with some engine trouble on his van.

Chris 83 has nothing but praise for City’s owners and the positives he feels the club’s success has brought.

(Image: ABNM Photography)

“It’s not just the club it’s the development they do a lot for us” he told the M.E.N.

“I’ve a granddaughter that works at City in the academy.

“We’ve been there a couple of times it’s definitely benefited the area.

“There’s not many owners that are not foreign you look at all the trouble at United.

“The Abu Dhabi owners have done a lot apart from buying players. ""

“There’s lots of jobs. I’ve got three nieces who work there on match days.

“People come from all over the country to the stadium.

“You have Chinese people coming taking pictures outside.”

Asked about the head-spinning money City spend on players and wages Chris quipped: “It doesn’t come out of my pocket I don’t mind!”

Listening to Chris and Gary's perspectives on the modern Manchester City paints a stark contrast with so-called ""legacy fans"" who support the other teams recently involved in the European Super League plot.

Liverpool's own players spoke out collectively against the breakaway plan Arsenal's fans came out their thousands to voice their displeasure and most notoriously Manchester United fans got a game called off after protesters gained access to the pitch.

When fans got back inside Old Trafford - this time legitimately to watch a game earlier this month against Fulham - passionate and peaceful protests against the Glazer family who own the club continued.

Meanwhile at the Etihad there was no large protest outside the ground. Even grumblings on social media were kept to a minimum.

In the Blue half of Manchester there is no desire to run these owners out of town.

“We’ve been here 31 years"" he tells us.

“It’s changed a lot.

“There’s still a lot of our regulars as well as new people it’s a mix now.

“[The development in Ancoats and New Islington] is making the city centre bigger.

“Anywhere you look now there’s development.

“It brings people to the area.

“We’re actually having a refurbishment to try and fit in with the area.

“We’ll have 25 or 30 covers as well as the takeaway. “

Asked what she thinks of all the new flats she said: ""I think it's great I think it's made the area better.

""There's more work we've got the tram stop town is right there.

""There's more jobs years ago it was nothing like this.

""When the weather's lovely it's absolutely brilliant down at the marina.

""There's all different people.

""I bought my council house four years ago - I was paying £400 a month and now my mortgage is £180 a month.

""We got it for £33000 and now they are worth £250000.

""Since all this has been going on the prices are sky high.

""I know someone who sold up for £260000 and moved to Failsworth.

""It's still Ancoats it's just up and coming.""

‘There are two sides to how people live’

On Purslow Close however Stacey Cain has a different view.

She lives in a property managed by One Manchester the social housing provider.

(Image: Joel Goodman)

She says she would have liked to have bought the property with her partner rather than carry on paying rent.

Many others on the estate have done so over the years often taking advantage of a vastly reduced price under the Right To Buy scheme.

But the arrival of the Etihad stadium and the wider regeneration of the area stretching from east Manchester to the city centre has caused house prices to soar.

Now Stacey says she’d need £190000 to buy her house.

“I would rather they knocked all this down and move me away and build some nice new houses” she said.

“Everywhere round here is new apartments - and this estate and the one facing the stadium have got really scruffy.

“There’s two sides to how people live.”

Walking around certain parts of Beswick and Ancoats it’s easy to see what Stacey means.

Outside her nearest corner shop a young woman spoke openly to the M.E.N about waiting to pick up drugs from her dealer.

When he arrived she picked them up and then walked straight over to an old BT phone box crouched down and appeared to be injecting herself.

It was around 3.30pm in the afternoon and young children were returning home from school and watching from only a few metres away.

The contrast between the shiny apartments at the edge of the city centre and some of the run-down social housing only a stone’s throw away can be startling.

(Image: Joel Goodman)

The number of children living in poverty after housing costs in the area around Beswick is 52 per cent according to figures published by Greater Manchester Poverty Action.

The borough of Manchester as a whole has one of the highest rates of child poverty in the country at 42 per cent an increase of 6 per cent since 2014.

The Ancoats and Beswick area also scores highly in other indices of poverty such as childhood obesity benefit claimants and incidence of cancer.

Life expectancy in the ward is 73.8. In the neighbouring city centre ward of Piccadilly it is 80.7.

These are problems that Manchester has had to grapple with for decades.

The era of austerity and government cuts have without doubt played a significant part in worsening the situation.

(Image: Joel Goodman)

Manchester Council lost £379million in funding over a decade and cut 40 per cent of its workforce.

A further £41million of cuts was approved this year as a result of revenue lost due to the pandemic.

But it is in this context that critics take aim at the council’s relationship with the Abu Dhabi United Group.

In 2014 City’s owners formed a joint business venture with the council Manchester Life with the aim of building thousands of new homes in Ancoats and New Islington.

At the time Manchester Council stated new partnerships were needed to stimulate residential growth and accommodate the city’s rapidly growing population expected to hit 600000 within the next few years.

It is no secret that Manchester like much of the country is facing a housing crisis.

(Image: Joel Goodman)

But many argue that building homes aimed at higher income earners is not the problem.

This month a report from RightMove put five places in Greater Manchester in the top ten property hotspots in the country.

Didsbury where the average asking price is £367429 was number one.

Affordable housing defined as shared ownership schemes or those offered at 80 per cent of market rate is what’s needed critics say.

Between 2015-20 only 13259 new homes were built in Manchester of which just 1514 of these - around 25 pc - are classed as affordable.

During the first two phases of Manchester Life development the company has delivered four rental sites Cotton Field Wharf Sawmill Court Smith’s Yard and Weaver’s Quay and three for sale Murray’s Mill New Little Mill and One Vesta Street.

Manchester Life has not yet delivered any affordable housing even though Manchester Council’s own policy is that all residential developments should include 20pc.

(Image: Joel Goodman)

The company announced a 10-year plan with affordable housing provider Great Places in 2019 and some sites are now coming to market.

But critics argue Manchester Life has done little so far to help the city’s low earners and suggest in fact it has contributed a spiralling rental costs.

When Cotton Field Wharf opened in 2017 rents for a one-bed unfurnished apartment started at £675 a month.

Now one-beds are being offered on RightMove for £865 a month.

Although apartments vary in price depending on where they are in the building that still represents an increase of almost 30pc in less than four years.

And where does all the rental income go?

(Image: Manchester City FC via Getty Images)

Manchester Council admitted in 2019 that it does not receive any of the income generated by Manchester Life properties but that instead there are 'longer-term profit sharing arrangements’.

A report recently published by academics Dr Tom Gillespie and Dr Jon Silver recently called for greater scrutiny of how Manchester Life has been able to acquire land for development.

The company has so far paid around £460000 per acre for land the report found contrasting this with £3.5m per acre Manchester Council paid for the former Central Retail Park in Ancoats.

The authors also say there is no evidence of whether Manchester Council receives any income for the sale of Manchester Life properties.

""As the single largest beneficiary of public land disposals and the single biggest developer of residential units in Ancoats and New Islington Manchester Life is set to make large profits from the disposal of Council land in order to construct high value apartments and houses"" the report says.

""In our view this raises important questions about the relationship between the Council and ADUG and who benefits from this partnership.""

With the city centre property market now among the hottest in the country Manchester Life has also come under scrutiny for its treatment of tenants.

In 2019 the company faced a backlash after issuing section 21 eviction notices to its first wave of residents at the end of their 12-month tenancies.

(Image: Joel Goodman)

Section 21 notices - which mean landlords can evict tenants even if they’ve paid their rent on time and have looked after the property - have been blamed for Manchester’s spiralling homeless crisis.

Campaigners say landlords use them to get rid of good tenants so they can hike up rents.

The Labour Party made it a manifesto commitment to have them abolished and it was therefore acutely embarrassing for councillors to find they were being used by a property firm half-owned by the council.

Manchester Life insisted the notices were not being used improperly and no one was being evicted.

But under the weight of widespread criticism from tenants and campaigners Manchester Life changed its policy.

Victoria Daet 27 and Andrew Buck 26 recently moved to Ancoats and managed to find a one-bed apartment for £700 a month.

They said they looked at Manchester Life apartments but found them too expensive.

“We read bad reviews [about Manchester Life] before we got here just on Google” said Victoria.

“Not only about the building itself but the management.

“It seems like a lot of the management blocks don’t do a great job.

“I remember people saying it was quite expensive and they would’ve expected better.”

‘There has to be a question whether there has been much trickle down’

Marcia Hutchinson was elected as the new Labour councillor for Ancoats and Beswick for the first time earlier this month.

It had been expected she would face a tight race for the seat because of unpopular council decisions in the area such as plans to build a car park on the former Central Retail Park.

In the end she romped home with a significant majority over her Lib Dem rival.

As a candidate Marcia sought to position herself as a vocal critic of some council leadership policies and the Manchester Life joint venture with City’s owners is one of them.

“I don’t want to knock an organisation [Manchester City] that has brought money into the area - but has the council got best value for the land that’s been sold? That has to be a big question” she said.

“I moved to Beswick in 2012 and I used to jog around the Etihad stadium and I really felt - it looks great but it’s not necessarily benefitting people who live there.

“There has to be a question whether there has been much ‘trickle down’ in general.”

(Image: Joel Goodman)

“The Grey Mare Lane estate is in such a bad state it’s getting demolished but we don’t know when - one of the complaints you hear on the doorstep is ‘we’re not being informed’.

“I think there’s a worry about communicating properly.

“I’ve got no problem working with developers - but the lack of affordable housing and social housing is worrying.

“The strategy of the council 25 or 30 years ago was ‘we don’t want to be another failed northern city’ but I don’t think it’s the right strategy now when we’ve got an overheated and successful market.

“We need to insist on affordable housing and social housing on site.”

Basil Simmonds 63 is an Ancoats resident of more than 40 years and has seen considerable change.

He lived on what used to be the Cardroom Estate a once-thriving community that by the early 2000s was in rapid decline ravaged by drugs and crime.

The estate was bulldozed to make way for the area now rebranded New Islington.

A Man City fan Basil now lives in One Manchester social housing on nearby Tutbury Street.

His thoughts perhaps sum up the many contradictions of Manchester’s successes and failures.

“I used to live where they put all the big houses I had three bedrooms over there” said Basil.

“I swapped it for a two bed.

“I couldn’t afford the bedroom tax - it was £11 or £12 a week extra.

“But I like it here it’s nice and quiet the people are friendly.

“I think life is what you make of it.”

'Ancoats was a ghost town'

Responding to criticism of the council's relationship with the City Football Group Sir Richard Leese Leader of Manchester City Council told the Manchester Evening News that east Manchester today is a place ""people are choosing to live"".

He says this is because of the money spent in the area - but adds that ""investment by the football club was never going to compensate for the loss of 70000 manufacturing jobs during the Thatcher era"".

Mr Leese added: ""It must be remembered that east Manchester was in a state of stagnation following decades of deindustrialisation which ripped the vast majority of employment and opportunity from the communities who lived there.

(Image: Joel Goodman)

""Following the move of the club to the Etihad the City Football Group have fulfilled all the investment promises they have made to the city becoming a significant contributor to the Manchester economy and driving key regeneration. The story of east Manchester without that support would be very different. Not least their Academy as an exemplar of green development that also reclaimed a large heavily polluted area.

""House prices in the area have risen. This is because for many years east Manchester suffered massive depopulation and there was zero demand for homes.""

He points to the increase in family poverty over the last decades in such areas being ""entirely because of austerity and changes to welfare like the benefit cap and the introduction of Universal Credit"".

""Indeed things like school readiness education performance and employment levels have all vastly improved in east Manchester in recent years"" he adds.

""Equally not two decades ago Ancoats was a ghost town – and a place most people tried to avoid. Today the neighbourhood is hugely popular and cited as one of the best places to live in the UK. Proven by the fact that residents are choosing to stay there long-term. What's more we have always demanded some of the highest residential property standards in the country and Manchester Life exceeded those standards.

""Rents have risen in this part of the city centre because demand remains very high and supply of homes is catching up – but this situation would be considerably worse without the key investment of Manchester Life.""",,,,,,

What Defines Corporate Sales?

According to Reference.com the best corporate sales definition is that ""Corporate sales are the sales that a company makes to another company through its everyday transactions. Corporate sales are also called B2B sales or business-to-business sales. On the other hand if sales are made directly to the end consumer these are called business-to-consumer or B2C sales.""

Who are the Top 10 Companies in the Fortune 500?

Walmart Amazon Exxon Mobil Apple CVS Health Berkshire Hathaway UnitedHealth Group McKesson AT&T AmerisourceBergen

Walmart Inc. leads the top spot of the Fortune 500 list at $559 billion in revenue. AmerisourceBergen Corporation rounds out the tenth position with $189 billion for 2020. The top ten companies combined for over $2.6 trillion in sales and revenue. It is difficult to know exactly how much was attributed to corporate sales due to several of the top companies generating revenue in the B2C sector.

Corporate Sales Strategies Used by Fortune 500 Executives

""Your sales strategy needs to lead with a clear articulation of the challenge you can help your prospect solve. At the beginning of a sales conversation your prospect likely doesn't fully understand the benefits of what you're selling. The last thing you want to do is immediately treat your product or service like a commodity rather than a valuable solution to a real business need they have"" said Steli Efti CEO of Close.com. Close is a ""Sales-as-a-Service"" as well as a ""Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) technology company developed for salespeople by salespeople.

Be a Problem Solver to Alleviate Pain Points

One of the main paths to a winning corporate sales strategy is to alleviate a customer's pain point with what your company offers. If a brand is known for being helpful in this way customers will surely become brand advocates. For example your content marketing can include free ebooks educational YouTube videos or bootcamp style lessons. These types of offers will help people get to know your brand better and convince them that they need to use your product. HubSpot shared this strategy in ""How to Improve Your Corporate Marketing Strategies.""

Don't Try to Sell Anything on the Initial Outreach

This may sound counterproductive according to Inc.com's insights shared in ""5 Secrets For Landing a Whale of a Client."" However not trying to sell a company on products or services immediately can sometimes lead to a sale more quickly than a pushy hard-nosed sales pitch. How this strategy works for example let us say a news report comes out on a company in a situation that your company's products or solutions are well equipped to help with.

Cold email outreach or call the head of the affected department mentioning the news coverage on their company and offer to email over a resource that might be helpful to them. Without trying to schedule an appointment talk about products or services or push for a sale end the call. A high percentage of the time the company executive will then want to schedule a call to talk because the approach was from a position of trying to help without asking for anything in return.

Clearly Articulate the End Results

People buy results not just products or services. After a prospect's attention has been captured with what they'll be able to achieve by using your company's solution it is now time to clearly explain how that will happen and what they get after purchasing. End results equal showing the value of what is in it for them.

Selling a premium solution to a Fortune 500 company that has never used one before will require clear details for the buyer. For example educating them about how your solution will work how much of a time investment to expect in managing it and the types of ongoing support they will have access to.



This corporate sales strategy is particularly relevant if you are selling a product or service that comes with an upfront fee requires a complex rollout has time-intensive integrations or ongoing collaboration with your customers after closing the deal. Prospects need to know exactly what they're going to get as far as deliverables when those milestones will be met and the downstream impact they are expected to have on their business.

After controlling for a range of covariates we demonstrated that public health insurance was expected to reduce the outpatient financial barriers faced by people with chronic diseases while private health insurance was found to be a positive predictor of inpatient financial barriers.

Our research demonstrated that only public health insurance had the potential to reduce the financial burden for people with chronic diseases which is consistent with previous studies [19 37]. The positive effects of public health insurance on reducing financial strain could be explained by that public health insurance is with a relatively bigger pool and hence has higher potential for financial risk protection. Specifically our research demonstrated that public health insurance was efficient in reducing the outpatient financial strain while was not statistically associated with the reduction of inpatient financial strain. Furthermore we found that UEI was the only public health insurance that was expected to reduce both outpatient and inpatient financial barriers which aligns with previous research [20 21]. UEI is mandatory and has higher insurance premiums which may explain why UEI was more efficient in reducing financial strain than URI and NRCI. Meanwhile another possible reason lies in that although the Chinese government has been increasing financial input on developing NRCI [38] people covered by NRCI are rural residents who tend to have lower economic status and are more vulnerable to the economic burden of chronic diseases.

Our research also demonstrated that the private health insurance was a positive predictor of having inpatient financial strain. As stated above public health insurance was ineffective in reducing the inpatient financial strain for people with chronic diseases. In such circumstance people with chronic diseases may in turn purchase private health insurance to relieve potential financial problems incurred by chronic diseases. Moreover people with chronic diseases are more likely to purchase private health insurance given that they are more cognizant of their own health conditions [39] and the existence of adverse selection in private health insurance market may explain why private insurance was positively associated with financial strain.

Several policy implications were derived based on our research findings: First strategies targeting at prevention and treatment of chronic diseases should be further developed [40]. For instance policies such as the “Medium- and long-term plan for the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases in China (2017-2025)” [41] were suggested to be further diffused and associated measures were suggested to be proposed to facilitate the implementation of these health insurance policies with the goal of alleviating the financial difficulty faced by people with chronic diseases. Second the capacity of public health insurance in reducing the inpatient financial barriers for people with chronic diseases should be improved. People with chronic diseases usually suffer from problems in the physical psychological and social domains having diverse and complex needs in the areas of prevention care and cure [42]. Therefore public health insurance schemes in China are suggested to shift from focusing on medical treatment to covering a wide range of healthcare services. Meanwhile more efforts should be put on improving the financial protective ability of public health insurance in China. Third an integrated health insurance system is suggested to be constructed given that health insurance schemes in China differ distinctively in terms of their premiums and the reimbursement ratios and weakened the mutual aid of the health insurance system [43]. Forth exploring the potential of private health insurance in mitigating the financial barriers for people with chronic disease should be set as another policy priority. A prior study has demonstrated that in the case of unsubscribed private health insurance among the people with chronic diseases the unmet medical experience was significantly higher than that of those who signed up [18]. This finding highlighted the paramount significance of private health insurance in satisfying the medical needs of people with chronic diseases. However private health insurance only accounted for a minor part in the health insurance market in China [44] and there is an urgent need for further exploring the potential effects of private health insurance in assisting people with chronic diseases to access affordable health services.

Our research has some strengths: first our research has the potential to provide both practical and academic implications. We demonstrated that public health insurance was useful in helping people with chronic diseases to access affordable outpatient health services while private health insurance may serve as a positive predictor of having inpatient financial strain. These results may inspire researchers and policymakers to re-consider the role and function of different types of health insurance in preventing and managing chronic diseases in China. Second our study used a national-level dataset and therefore is representative of China.

However several limitations should be recognized: Limited by data accessibility we were unable to measure the magnitude of financial strain for specific types of chronic diseases. Nevertheless our research was still useful in predicting the impacts of health insurance on financial barriers of people with chronic diseases. Second only a small number of our sampled participants were separated did not have “hukou” and had tertiary education which resulted in large standard errors and odds ratios. Future studies are suggested to include more participants to evaluate the impacts of these categories on financial strain. Another limitation was that we expected that the endogenous relationship between financial strain and purchasing health insurance may bias our estimation results. Our study adjusted endogeneity for the outpatient sample but failed to solve the possible endogenous relationship between having private insurance and inpatient financial strain. Nevertheless we believe that our research findings could provide preliminary evidence that for people with chronic diseases having private insurance was positively associated with inpatient financial strain. We highly recommended future research to employ appropriate instrumental variables or other econometric techniques to generate more precise estimation results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9mYWN0Y2hlY2svMjAyMS8wNS8yOS9mYWN0LWNoZWNrLXN1cHJlbWUtY291cnQtZGlkbnQtY2FuY2VsLXVuaXZlcnNhbC12YWNjaW5hdGlvbi83NDczNjI3MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fact check: Supreme Court didn't 'cancel' universal vaccination,"The claim: The Supreme Court has ""canceled universal vaccination""

As more than 40 states consider legislation that would prohibit COVID-19 vaccine mandates an old hoax about the Supreme Court and vaccination has been resurrected on social media.

A screenshot published in a May 27 Instagram post says the highest court in the nation has ""canceled universal vaccination.""

""Bill Gates US Chief Infectious Disease Specialist (Dr. Anthony) Fauci and Big Pharma have lost a lawsuit in the US Supreme Court failing to prove that all of their vaccines over the past 32 years have been safe for the health of citizens!"" text in the screenshot reads. ""The lawsuit was filed by a group of scientists led by Senator Kennedy.""

The screenshot traces back to a May 23 article from Inspirer Radio a Nigerian website. The ""senator"" referenced in the article and related social media posts is Robert F. Kennedy Jr. an anti-vaccine activist and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy. The Inspirer Radio article includes a long anti-coronavirus vaccine screed attributed to Kennedy.

Fact check:COVID-19 variants come from mutations not vaccines

The Supreme Court has not ruled against vaccine mandates. Independent fact-checking organizations debunked a similar hoax circulating on social media last year.

Ikedieze Kanu Okorie CEO of the company that operates Inspirer Radio told USA TODAY he didn't have any ""strong evidence"" to support the original story and had published a fact check on his website May 26 pointing out it isn't true. That check was originally published by the Agence France-Presse in April.

But Inspirer Radio left the original story online as of May 28.

USA TODAY reached out to social media users who shared the claim for additional comment.

No ""universal vaccination"" case

The federal government does not require universal vaccination in the U.S. and the Supreme Court hasn't weighed in on the issue.

A search for recent cases on universal vaccination turned up no results from the Oyez Project an unofficial Supreme Court archive. A docket search on the court's website also didn't turn up any recent rulings on vaccines. And there are no cases in either search naming Gates and Fauci as co-defendants.

There is no federal law that mandates vaccines for all citizens. Instead states and employers generally have the right to require vaccination.

For example all 50 states require some vaccines for children attending public schools with exceptions for those with disabilities or with religious philosophical or medical objections. To date no states have passed laws requiring COVID-19 vaccination and then-President-elect Joe Biden said in December that he would not make COVID-19 vaccines mandatory.

In the past the Supreme Court has upheld laws requiring vaccination.

In the 1905 Supreme Court decision Jacobson v. Massachusetts the court found a Massachusetts law permitting vaccine mandates did not violate the right to liberty protected by the 14th Amendment.

The claim about a Supreme Court decision on universal vaccination appears to stem from a 2018 Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed in a U.S. district court in New York AFP reported.

Fact check:Moderna executive did not say mRNA vaccines alter recipient's DNA

That lawsuit filed by the anti-vaccine Informed Consent Action Network and backed by Kennedy alleged the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services withheld reports on vaccine side effects.

The department did not locate records responsive to ICAN's public information request but it had monitored vaccines for safety. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York — not the Supreme Court — and it did not deal with the legality of universal vaccination.

""That statement is untrue. Idk where it came from"" Kennedy told USA TODAY in an email.

USA TODAY reached out to the Supreme Court for comment.

Our rating: False

The claim that the Supreme Court has ""canceled universal vaccination"" is FALSE based on our research. The Supreme Court has not recently ruled against vaccine mandates. To the contrary the court has previously upheld states' authority to require vaccination. The claim is an old hoax that has been repeatedly debunked by independent fact-checkers.

And most Nigerians believed his government would help fix the sector. The emergence of COVID-19 further re-echoed the necessity for prioritising the health sector but it appears only a little has changed in a country that parades some of the world’s worst health indices The ICIR reports.

Emergence of COVID-19

In April 2020 Secretary to the Government of the Federation Boss Mustapha expressed shock at what he saw in Nigerian public hospitals having inspected some of the facilities.

As the Chairman Presidential Taskforce (PTF) on COVID-19 he travelled across the country to monitor the nation’s preparedness for tackling the pandemic.

From Worst to Worst: Buhari’s six years and the fight against insecurity

Six years in office Buhari’s power reforms yet to ‘light up’ Nigeria

Mustapha saw hospitals without beds emergency wards without ambulances intensive care units without power supply and health facilities in shortage of human resources and infrastructures needed for services.

He saw dilapidated hospital buildings occupied by reptiles and other pests. He would not conceal his feelings and told the leadership of the National Assembly: “I never knew that our entire healthcare infrastructure was in the state in which it is. Until I was appointed to do this work.”

Mustapha has been in office since October 2017.

His admission is symbolic of the neglect which the country’s health systems have suffered over the years and the hopelessness of many citizens in seeking care in health facilities.

Political office holders like him are fond of seeking healthcare abroad.

But in 2020 coronavirus forced everyone to remain in their countries at least for some months.

Challenges of Nigeria health sector include underfunding corruption poor remuneration brain drain inadequate infrastructures poor leadership insufficient human resources and poor health insurance coverage that has remained at a single percentage of the population since its launch in 2005.

These challenges promote self-medication out-of-pocket spending for health; low morale for health professionals; preventable diseases and death.

Fears over failings of Nigeria health systems peaked at the onset of COVID-19 in Nigeria in March 2020.

First most citizens believed that despite the lack of immediate pharmaceutical solutions to the disease the country’s health infrastructures would not match the responses given to the virus in other parts of the world.

To prevent the disease from spreading in Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari ordered a lockdown in key states on March 30. Some state governors also took similar measures to curb the spread of the virus.

Following the rollout of measures to combat the disease Nigeria began to have lockdowns in phases effective May 4 2020.

According to the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) as of Thursday May 27 the country had 166098 cases 2071 deaths and 156528 recoveries from the virus.

Global cases on that day were 169093368 deaths were 3512497 while there were 150835753 recoveries as shown by The ICIR dashboard.

Nigeria confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on February 27 2020. The case involved an Italian who returned from Italy to Lagos on February 25 2020.

Though the index case recovered the virus infected more people in Nigeria resulting in deaths.

Some of the persons killed by the disease were Chief of Staff to the President Abba Kyari; immediate past governor of Oyo State Abiola Ajimobi; Commissioner for Health in Ondo State Wahab Adegbenro; and spokesperson to Yoruba socio-cultural group Yinka Odumakin.

Through COVAX Facility a partnership between CEPI Gavi UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) Nigeria received its first shipment of AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine on March 2 this year.

The shipment contained 3.9 million doses of the vaccine from the Serum Institute of India (SII) the vaccine manufacturer.

Vaccination against the virus has been marred by vaccine apathy despite the shortage of the vaccine.

Our reporter also observed that the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) did not contact most people who registered for the vaccine to receive it.

The Federal Government gave priority to political office holders health workers security personnel and media practitioners.

On January 27 President Buhari signed the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Health Protection Regulations making wearing face masks in public place compulsory. The ICIR reports that many Nigerians do not wear it even while in crowded public places and vehicles.

Similarly many religious worship centres shun health advisories for the prevention of the virus by health authorities.

Some of the concerns over the pandemic in Nigeria are the nation’s inability to produce its vaccine for the disease and the effectiveness of port authorities to stop people from countries banned by Nigeria from gaining entry into the nation.

The Federal Government had on Sunday May 23 declared 90 international travellers from Brazil India United Arab Emirates and Turkey wanted for violating the provisions of the COVID-19 Health Protection Regulations.

In the same vein the National Agency for Food Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has repeatedly given assurances that experts were working to produce local vaccines for the disease. No local vaccine is yet available for public use. The agency has also alerted the country to the possibility of criminals importing fake vaccine into the nation.

COVID-19 financing

Some of the Federal Government expenditures on COVID-19 include N100 billion credit for health infrastructures in the nation by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).

The Bank which led interventions against the virus in the country said its stimulus package against the disease would reach 2.7 billion dollars.

The Bank approved N253 million grant to health researcher under its Health Sector Research and Development Intervention Scheme (HSRDIS) as part of its contributions to the fight against the pandemic.

In April 2020 the Federal Government sought the approval of the National Assembly to establish a 500 billion Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Crisis Intervention Fund.

In June 2020 the African Development Bank approved a $288.5 million loan for Nigeria to help it tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.

Also the Federal Government released 10 billion naira to Lagos State which has the highest cases and fatalities from the virus in the country.

In January this year the Federal Government approved a 6.4 billion naira for setting up oxygen production plants in 38 sites across the country to bolster the fight against COVID-19.

In January this year the Federal Government released 10 billion to support local production of the COVID-19 vaccine.

The government had said in December 2020 that it needed N400 billion naira to vaccinate 70 per cent of Nigerians against the virus.

These amounts are in addition to billions of naira realised through the Nigeria Private Sector Coalition Against COVID-19 (COCAVID).

COVID-19-related corruption cases in Nigeria

The Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) led the roll call of agencies accused of mismanaging funds when COVID-19 raged in Nigeria.

The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) accused NDDC’s management of diverting over N5 billion meant purchasing personnel protective equipment in the nine oil-producing states for personal use. They were also alleged to have shared N1.6 billion among themselves and their subordinates as palliatives for COVID-19.

Similarly the House of Representatives on May 24 queried the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) of spending over N152 million on diesel facemasks and hand sanitisers.

How COVID-19 compounds health care delivery

Meanwhile the emergence of COVID-19 in Nigeria compounded the affordability and accessibility of healthcare in the country. Many hospitals hiked the costs of their services to discourage patients from crowding their facilities. For instance the Air Force Base hospital in Abuja charged less than N20000 for anti-natal registration before the pandemic. It hiked the cost to N40000 during the pandemic.

Nigeria faced with many disease burdens poor health outcomes

While Nigeria appears to be doing well in the containment of COVID-19 other diseases in the country do not enjoy similar support.

For many years the country has contributed nearly a quarter of the global malaria burden.

According to the WHO 20 per cent of all global maternal deaths occur in Nigeria.

The 2013National Demographic and Health Survey shows that infant and under-5 mortality rates were 69 and 128 deaths per 1000 live births respectively. But in 2018 the infant mortality rate reduced to 67 deaths per 1000 live births while under-5 mortality rose to 132 deaths per 1000 live births.

25 per cent of children aged 12-23 months were fully vaccinated in 2013 NDHS result. The number grew to 31 per cent in 2018 version of the exercise.

The maternal mortality ratio was 576 maternal deaths per 100000 live births in 2013. In the NDHS 2018 report it was estimated at 512 maternal deaths per 100000 live births.

Some communicable and non-communicable diseases in which Nigeria has a significant lead globally are HIV/AIDS tuberculosis cholera typhoid Lassa Fever hypertension cancer and diabetes.

Health financing during Buhari administration

Health financing has not improved under the Buhari administration. In 2016 the Federal Government had a budget of 6.06 trillion out of which it earmarked 550 billion to the health sector. The amount represented 4.1 per cent of the budget. The government allocated 221billion naira and N28.6 billion as capital and recurrent expenditure respectively.

In 2017 the total budget was 7.4 trillion. The health sector got 304.1 billion representing 4.0 per cent. Capital allocation for the year was N51.3 billion while recurrent expenditure gulped 252.8 billion.

2018 saw a further decline in the percentage of the health budget to the national budget. The total federal budget was 9.1 trillion that year from which the sector got 356.4 billion. Recurrent expenditure was 269.9 billion while the capital budget was 86.4 billion.

In 2020 the government reduced budget allocation to the Basic Health Care Provision Fund by more than 40 per cent from N44.4 billion to N25.5 billion.

Out of this year budget of 13.6 trillion recurrent and capital of N380 billion and N134 billion respectively were allocated to the health sector giving a total of 514 billion.

However international development agencies such as the World Health Organization United Nations Children Fund United Nations Population Fund Bill &Melinda Gates Foundation Marie Stopes Pathfinder International World Bank among others play prominent roles in funding health programmes in the country.

Before President Muhammadu Buhari election in 2015 the sector used to experience many industrial actions resulting from disagreements between the levels of government and workforce in public hospitals.

But the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) has always embarked on strike following unmet demands by the government.

The President started his intervention in the health sector with the disbursement of N1.5 million dollars to each state in the country and the FCT for boosting primary health care services. The fund was from the World Bank. The Federal Government rewarded states that delivered good results with the fund with additional funds.

He followed it up with another initiative seeking to rehabilitate 10000 primary health care centres in the country.

The government also launched the Nigeria Reproductive Maternal Newborn Child Adolescent and Elderly Health Plus Nutrition (RMNCAEH+N). It is a multi-stakeholder partnership coordination platform that would harmonise the health interventions of the government and health partners to reduce wastage and channel funds to get the desired result to achieve Universal Health Care Coverage.

President’s many medical trips

The ICIR has reported how Buhari overtook former President Umar Yar’Adua in medical trips abroad spending 172 days outside Nigeria within his two years in office.

He also jetted out of Nigeria to London on March 30 2021 for a medical check-up leaving behind a health sector grounded by a doctors’ strike across the country.

At least the President travelled out of the country seven times for medical treatment in the past six years. The longest he has stayed on a medical trip was 103 days. He embarked on the trip on August 19 2017.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vY2hpbXByZXBvcnRzLmNvbS9taW5pc3RyeS1vZi1oZWFsdGgtcGNhdS1sYXVuY2gtZXNzZW50aWFsLXBhbGxpYXRpdmUtY2FyZS1wYWNrYWdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ministry of Health PCAU Launch Essential Palliative Care Package,"The Palliative Care Association of Uganda (PCAU) together with the Ministry of Health have on Friday launched the Essential Palliative Care Package (EPCP) for Universal Health Coverage in Uganda.

The activity was part of their Annual General Meeting in Kampala which brings together various stakeholders.

The package is a tool on basic parameters for Universal Health Coverage (UHC) actors in Uganda and an advocacy tool for health care advocates seeking to ensure the integration of palliative care in all UHC processes and interventions.

Representing Dr. Henry Mwebesa Director-General Health Services Dr. Jackson Amone commissioner clinical services at the ministry of health noted that Palliative Care focuses on improving the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problem associated with life-threatening illness.

“This is done through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early problem identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems physical psychological and spiritual. Patients with chronic conditions requiring palliative care include cancer HIV/AIDS degenerative neurological conditions end stage organ failure genetic conditions like Sickle Cell Anemia and stroke among others” he said.

The need for palliative care around the world and in Uganda he said continues to grow due to an increase in Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and the aging populations.

He further said that the Ministry of Health in its efforts to achieve Universal Health Coverage is committed to integrating Palliative Care into the Health Care Structure at least up to Health Center IV level. He said

“In the bid to ensure that this is accomplished the Director General Health Services issued a directive to all Directors and Hospital superintendents to avail space for Palliative Care; Strides have also been made towards creation of a Palliative Care Division in the Hospitals and health center IVs.”

Mr. Mark Mwesiga PCAU country director noted that four aspects are included in the package.

“We came up with a package from that which was developed by the African Palliative Care for the African continent. This advocacy tool concerns four aspects; the essential medicines for palliative care; essential equipment patient supportive devices and supplies recommended for homecare and facility use; human resource and education and also the psychosocial support interventions” he explained.

Dr. Miriam Ajambo senior medical officer and palliative care focal person at the ministry of health noted that palliative care in Uganda has lagged behind for some time much as it was initiated some time back as far as 1993.

“That is why together with palliative association of Uganda ministry of health felt it wise to put this package together so that whatever is needed for UHC in line with palliative care is captured and we as ministry can refer to it and ensure that this is put in place for us to achieve universal health.

This package comes in in line with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.8 that talks about UHC and this incorporates the preventive; curative rehabilitative and palliative care is one of the components” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5haHJhbS5vcmcuZWcvTmV3c0NvbnRlbnQvMS82NC80MTMxODQvRWd5cHQvUG9saXRpY3MtL0VneXB0LXRvLWVzdGFibGlzaC1tZWRpY2FsLWNvbXBsZXgtaW4tU3Vlei1hdC10b3RhLmFzcHjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Egypt to establish medical complex in Suez at total cost of EGP 3 billion to serve in UHIS - Politics - Egypt,"Governorates with the lowest-income citizens have been given priority in the programme’s schedule with the capital Cairo relegated to the final phase

El estudio que aún no ha sido publicado muestra además que la mitad de esos nuevos propietarios de armas son mujeres una quinta parte afroamericanos y otra quinta parte hispanos lo que apunta a una diversificación del perfil más habitual del comprador de armas que es el hombre blanco.

Los datos proceden de una encuesta entre 19 mil personas llevada a cabo en abril y apuntan a que alrededor de 6.5 por ciento de la población estadounidense -unos 17 millones de personas- adquirió armas el año pasado por encima del 5.3 por ciento de 2019.

En conjunto se calcula que 39 por ciento de los hogares del país tiene al menos un arma por encima del 32 por ciento de 2016.

Las ventas se dispararon el pasado año coincidiendo con el inicio de la pandemia de COVID-19 lo que hizo que en marzo de 2020 el número de verificaciones de antecedentes federales -una indicación aproximada del número de ventas de armas- alcanzaran un millón en una semana por primera vez desde que se comenzaron a recopilar datos en 1998.

Ese récord se volvió a superar esta primavera con una semana en la que se superaron las 1.2 millones de verificaciones según datos del FBI.

De las diez semanas con más verificaciones de antecedentes seis se han dado en lo que va de 2021 y otras tres tuvieron lugar en 2020.

La venta de armas lleva años al alza en Estados Unidos habitualmente con fuertes subidas en años de elecciones o tras crímenes notorios pero los últimos datos apuntan a un ritmo sin precedentes en la actualidad.

Desde el inicio de la pandemia además los tiroteos han aumentado de forma muy importante en numerosas ciudades del país tras años de reducciones.

El mes pasado el presidente estadounidense Joe Biden instó a la oposición republicana a que se una a los demócratas para restringir el acceso a las armas.

El líder estadounidense sostuvo que el problema de las armas que definió como un “derramamiento de sangre diario” no debería ser un asunto partidista y defendió prohibir los rifles de asalto y los cargadores de alta capacidad armas y dispositivos habituales en los tiroteos masivos.

El prolongado cierre de la plaza de Las Ventas se ha convertido en la polémica taurina del año. Bajó el telón el 19 de octubre de 2019 y solo lo ha levantado el pasado día 2 de mayo para la celebración de un festival organizado por la Comunidad de Madrid.

La empresa Plaza1 y el Gobierno regional ya no saben cómo justificar una situación que se extiende inexplicablemente en el tiempo

Las razones sanitarias persisten pero abiertas las plazas de Vistalegre y Leganés entre otras se impone una salida honrosa y urgente para la que está considerada como la catedral del toreo.

Diez abonados opinan sobre este peculiar asunto: la mayoría de ellos está que trina contra el cierre reparten responsabilidades entre las dos partes en litigio y exigen una apertura inmediata.

Estos son sus testimonios:

“Denuncio una total falta de transparencia hacia el aficionado” Jesús María Fernández presidente de la Unión de Abonados de Madrid.

Antonio Álvarez Barrios abogado y exmonosabio.-

“Simón Casas empresario de Las Ventas ha ofrecido unas cifras sobre ingresos y gastos con un aforo de 6.000 personas que parecen bastante creíbles. El festival del pasado día 2 no tiene nada que ver con una corrida; por cierto aún no se han publicado los resultados económicos de ese festejo.

La plaza de Madrid hay que abrirla cuanto antes; creo que la Comunidad de Madrid debe cambiar su política de ambigüedad sobre la apertura apostar claramente por la vuelta de los toros y reducir drásticamente el canon anual de una temporada que nace coja. Al final abogo por que las dos partes -propiedad y empresa gestora- hagan cesiones en beneficio de la fiesta.

La escasa asistencia de público a la plaza de Vistalegre me induce a pensar que se está jugando una baza muy peligrosa porque la gente tiene muchas ganas de ver toros pero otros están ya hartos de la espera”.

Muriel Feiner periodista y fotógrafa.-

“Las Ventas tiene que abrir sus puertas. Entiendo que ponerla en marcha debe ser muy caro pero los tiempos extraordinarios como son estos requieren medidas extraordinarias.

A mi juicio la responsabilidad principal compete a la Comunidad de Madrid que es la propietaria de la plaza; tendría que perdonar el canon este año y hacer propuestas viables.

Las dos partes deben arrimar el hombro en todos los sentidos y ajustarse el cinturón si es necesario.

Hay que hacer lo que sea para que vuelvan los toros a Madrid porque Las Ventas es el escaparate de la fiesta ante el mundo. Me preocupa que perdamos la costumbre de ir a los toros. La situación es muy seria y no podemos permitir que la pandemia sea la puntilla para la fiesta”.

François Zumbiehl catedrático de Lenguas Clásicas y antropólogo.-

“Me produce perplejidad e incomprensión que haya estado abierta la plaza de Vistalegre mientras permanece cerrada Las Ventas que es mucho más emblemática. Para la imagen internacional de la fiesta es el signo de una derrota.

En mi opinión se trata de un problema de responsabilidad política de la Comunidad de Madrid que pretende evitar que se le pueda acusar de un rebrote de la pandemia; o un asunto económico de la plaza no estoy muy seguro. De todos modos me parece incomprensible la situación actual”.

Jean Louis Personne presidente del Club Taurino de Milán.-

“La plaza de Las Ventas se debe abrir ya. San Isidro es la feria taurina más importante del mundo y debe celebrarse en la catedral de la tauromaquia.

En ella he presenciado más de trescientas corridas y cada tarde he sentido la misma emoción cuando he salido del hotel camino de mi localidad.

Celebrar San Isidro en Vistalegre es una catástrofe; y lo mantengo porque soy muy tradicionalista. Esta feria solo tiene sentido en Las Ventas que debe abrir sus puertas ya”.

""Será muy difícil que vuelva la normalidad a los toros en Madrid"" Alejandro de Luis abonado.

Rosa Basante miembro del consejo de administración del Centro de Asuntos Taurinos.

“El cierre de la plaza ha estado justificado porque el riesgo de contagio ha sido muy alto y la vacunación no ha comenzado hasta el pasado mes de febrero. Las normas sanitarias deben ser respetadas porque la salud es más importante que cualquier otro asunto.

El gerente del Centro de Asuntos Taurinos (CAT) ha manifestado que se podría abrir en verano y yo confío en que sea posible en otoño.

Dicho lo anterior Las Ventas es la catedral del toreo algo diferente y todas las partes deben trabajar para que los aficionados podamos disfrutar en las condiciones que exija la situación de la pandemia”.

Jesús María Fernández presidente de la Unión de Abonados de Madrid.-

“Creo que Plaza1 no ha tenido intención de organizar toros durante el mes de mayo bajo ningún concepto. Es verdad que la pandemia está ahí pero algún esfuerzo había que hacer. De hecho se hizo con el festival del 2 de mayo y todo salió bien.

Sabemos que esta temporada no será normal pero espero que haya toros en verano septiembre y octubre como ha dicho Miguel Abellán gerente del CAT; es fundamental que así sea para que el sector comience su recuperación.

Por otro lado denuncio una total falta de transparencia hacia el aficionado. Desconocemos cómo está el canon y si existe inviabilidad para celebrar festejos por alguna razón que desconocemos. No sabemos a qué atenernos. No discuto la buena voluntad de las partes pero al menos podría ofrecer una información lo más detallada posible sobre la situación”.

Rafael Cabrera director del Aula de Tauromaquia de la Universidad CEU San Pablo.-

“Una vergüenza. La Comunidad y la empresa tienen abandonada la plaza. La temporada debió comenzar como todos los años con el aforo exigido y carteles adecuados para que salgan las cuentas. Las dos partes han debido pactar una reducción de las condiciones del contrato o incluso la supresión temporal del mismo de acuerdo a los momentos extraordinarios que estamos viviendo. Si se reduce el aforo se reduce el canon.

Por otra parte la dejadez del CAT es total. No se han acometido las obras necesarias mientras la plaza ha estado cerrada. Parece como si solo les importara el beneficio económico. Por eso insisto en que la plaza está abandonada; y quizá sea mayor la responsabilidad de la Comunidad que es la que debería facilitar y exigir a la empresa que organice festejos.

Por lo demás no hay transparencia alguna; vivimos a expensas de rumores. Estamos en democracia aunque no sé hasta qué punto y habría que exigir luz y taquígrafos en todo este asunto”.

Beatriz Badorrey profesora de Historia del Derecho.-

“No entiendo por qué no se han celebrado festejos todavía en Las Ventas; sobre todo después del festival del día 2 y de que se haya abierto la plaza de Vistalegre.

A mi juicio hay una responsabilidad muy grande y compartida por todos: por la empresa la Comunidad -que tenía que haber negociado una reducción del canon- el mundo del toro que no se ha implicado y por los aficionados que no hemos sabido reivindicar que no se nos hurte lo que tanto queremos.

Constato además una preocupante ausencia de comunicación. No cuidan a los abonados que merecemos una explicación sobre lo que está pasando de verdad y por qué no se organizan festejos. Yo estoy indignada porque esa falta de información completa y veraz es una falta de respeto”.

Alejandro de Luis abonado.-

“Las Ventas podría estar abierta claro que sí; pero no sé si el cierre está plenamente justificado por razones sanitarias. Con un cuarto de plaza no se cubren los gastos y menos en esta plaza donde los precios son limitados.

Lo que sí veo es que nadie ayuda a la fiesta y será muy difícil que vuelva la normalidad a los toros en Madrid. ¿Culpa? La propia degeneración del espectáculo el avance del animalismo el escaso interés de la juventud…

Seguiré con mi abono pero dudo que Madrid vuelva a ser plaza de temporada”.

Andrés de Miguel presidente de la peña Los de José y Juan.-

“Yo creo que todos -administración empresa y aficionados- estamos en contra del cierre pero el problema no es ese sino lo que no se ha hecho..

El edificio sufre una serie de deficiencias funcionales que salieron a la luz durante el mandato municipal de Manuela Carmena y no se han acometido durante este negro periodo de pandemia.

Supongo además que el cierre está motivado por razones de salud pero la forma de afrontar un problema de esta magnitud es lo que permite que la solución sea mejor o peor; y creo que ha habido pasividad por parte del CAT y la empresa.

Es evidente asimismo que los aficionados no recibimos una información adecuada y suficiente. No hay explicación sobre los pormenores del problema ni seguimiento del mismo.

No basta con decir que existe interés en la celebración de festejos; hay que explicar los motivos y aclarar las dudas de la afición”.

La modalidad estimula los ingresos en Moneda Libremente Convertible (MLC) limitados por las trabas del bloqueo de Estados Unidos impuesto a Cuba.

El periódico Escambray de la central provincia cubana de Sancti Spíritus refleja que la variada oferta «incluye carnes deshuesadas boliche palomilla riñonada y filetes de res.

Emérido Hernández Farías director de Negocios y Comercialización en la entidad agropecuaria explicó que los consumidores una vez efectuada la compra disponen de siete días hábiles para recoger los alimentos los cuales permanecen en la Unidad Empresarial de Base Comercializadora de Productos Agropecuarios ubicada en el Consejo Popular de Simón Bolívar.

Para expandir este servicio a los usuarios nacionales la entidad se encuentra en fase de negociación con las cadenas de tiendas Cimex y TRD. Asimismo puntualizó Hernández Farías la institución trabaja por insertar el despacho a domicilio de los productos adquiridos para facilitar la comercialización y evitar la afluencia de personas en medio de la COVID-19.

Entre los territorios que más compras han realizado se encuentran los municipios de Sancti Spíritus Taguasco Cabaiguán y Yaguajay aunque esperan que la cifra aumente al igual que los ingresos que superaron los 8 000 dólares en el mes de abril.

Durante varios meses con frecuencia Horacio llegaba al corral que cercaba la casa de Olivia a pararse sin decir nada sólo para verla. Después de un rato se iba y al día siguiente o los dos días volvía y se repetía lo mismo.

Para pasar horas sólo viendo a Olivia Horacio recorría varios kilómetros desde su hogar.

En la casa de Olivia no había desconfianza por el joven sabían de quién era hijo porque en los pueblos de la Montaña de Guerrero casi todos se conocen por lo menos de vista.

Después de unos meses Horacio llegó con sus padres para hablar con los de Olivia. La oferta fue directa: quería a su hija para que fuera la esposa de Horacio quien era un adolescente con retraso mental.

¿Costumbre o transacción?

En la Montaña de Guerrero hay una tradición a la que llaman “dote”. Es algo ancestral de los pueblos originarios aunque ahora es una simple transacción económica. Antes era una ofrenda que una familia brindaba a otra por la felicidad de una nueva pareja. Entregaban flores panes cerveza algunos animales y dinero sin tarifas.

Ahora no las familias se meten en intensas negociaciones hasta llegar a un monto y la ofrenda la dejan en segundo plano. El pago varía entre los 40 80 y hasta 150 mil pesos por una niña.

El monto se establece según la tradición en tres aspectos: la edad (mientras más niña más vale) el comportamiento (si se sabe que ya tuvo novio su valor se demerita) y la educación (más educada menos valor).

Prevalece venta de niñas en Montaña de Guerrero

Explica que esta situación es una tradición tan arraigada en los pueblos de la zona de la Montaña que intervenir para evitarlo es casi imposible.

Otro problema expresa son las autoridades en específico los ayuntamientos que no mueven un dedo para evitar la venta de niñas. Otro problema más de tipo estructural es la pobreza.

“Muchas veces con la venta de las niñas las familias se quitan una boca de encima es un gasto menos pero igual de pobres son los que pagan por ellas”.

En ocasiones las familias pagan por una esposa para sus hijos para que no se vayan solos de jornaleros. Para comprarlas se endeudan venden sus animales o se van a trabajar largo tiempo para juntar el dinero.

Al final saben que es una inversión porque la mujer por la que pagaron trabajará —sin ningún pago— para recuperar los recursos destinados.

No conocen la felicidad

Ahora 20 años después Olivia y Horacio continúan viviendo juntos. Formaron una familia y tienen dos hijas una de nueve años y otra de uno.

Olivia no ha sido maltratada por Horacio de hecho ella lleva las riendas de la casa pero no es feliz. Se le nota la frustración. La convivencia entre ambos es mínima apenas cruzan palabras.

La mujer tiene muchas razones para ser infeliz pues desde que la obligaron a vivir con Horacio ella no sólo perdió su niñez también se hizo responsable de una casa.

Asumió la responsabilidad de buscar gran parte de los ingresos que necesitan para sobrevivir porque Horacio por su discapacidad no cuenta con un empleo constante. Es tan pobre como cuando vivía con sus padres.

El día de la visita Olivia teje el huipil frente a su hija y también está atenta de una olla que tiene en el fogón con leña donde está hirviendo un montón de quelites para la comida.

La escasez en la casa es permanente. Todos los días es una apuesta para conseguir algo de comida encontrar un trabajo cortando leña limpiando milpas de albañilería o esperando que alguien le compre una prenda —a la que le dedicó hasta dos meses de trabajo— a 200 o 300 pesos.

Con los quelites resolvió la alimentación de esos dos días pero cuando pasen volverán a esa lucha interminable.

Autoridades en la omisión

La venta de niñas y adolescentes en la Montaña explica la abogada de Tlachinollan es posible por la omisión de las autoridades locales. Arias recuerda el caso de una chica de Metlatónoc que salió huyendo a Tlapa porque su papá la quiso vender. Sin embargo ante la falta de trabajo y dinero tuvo que regresar a su pueblo. Sus padres la rechazaron y se fue a vivir con una tía.

Un día su padre y policías municipales entraron a la casa de la tía la sometieron la golpearon y después se la llevaron a barandillas. La acusaron de rebelde. Estuvo dos días en la cárcel. Todo lo autorizó el síndico municipal de entonces Felicitos Hernández.

Tlachinollan presentó una queja ante la Comisión Estatal de Derechos Humanos por abuso de autoridad. El síndico contestó que la encarceló por petición de sus padres debido a una “conducta ingobernable”.

En ese sentido también está el caso de Micaela una chica de Cochoapa El Grande quien era menor de edad cuando pagaron por ella 80 mil pesos.

El esposo y la tía pidieron al entonces síndico de Cochoapa El Grande Rutilio Ortega Maldonado que la citará junto con sus padres y acudieron a la reunión donde la acusaron de maltratar a su hijo.

Con presiones los hicieron firmar un documento en el que entregaba la custodia del niño a la tía y un pagaré por 55 mil pesos para los gastos de la boda. Le quitaron al niño y se lo devolverán hasta que liquide la deuda.

“Quitarle a los hijos se está convirtiendo en un método para que las niñas no dejen a los esposos” afirma la abogada mientras explica que la familia que paga siempre exige la devolución del dinero porque muchas veces tuvieron que pedir prestado o irse a los campos de jornaleros para juntar ese dinero."

Special to USA TODAY

Your internet provider may have an unappealing anniversary present waiting for you: a rate hike to celebrate your first year of service.

Expiring promotional rates persist in broadband even though their potential appeal to new subscribers is often erased by the annoyance of seeing the new-customer pricing vanish.

Analyst Roger Entner founder of Recon Analytics put it bluntly: “Everybody hates exploding prices.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8va3JlYnNvbnNlY3VyaXR5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1L3VzaW5nLWZha2UtcmV2aWV3cy10by1maW5kLWRhbmdlcm91cy1leHRlbnNpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Using Fake Reviews to Find Dangerous Extensions – Krebs on Security,"Fake positive reviews have infiltrated nearly every corner of life online these days confusing consumers while offering an unwelcome advantage to fraudsters and sub-par products everywhere. Happily identifying and tracking these fake reviewer accounts is often the easiest way to spot scams. Here’s the story of how bogus reviews on a counterfeit Microsoft Authenticator browser extension exposed dozens of other extensions that siphoned personal and financial data.

After hearing from a reader about a phony Microsoft Authenticator extension that appeared on the Google Chrome Store KrebsOnSecurity began looking at the profile of the account that created it. There were a total of five reviews on the extension before it was removed: Three Google users gave it one star warning people to stay far away from it; but two of the reviewers awarded it between three and four stars.

“It’s great!” the Google account Theresa Duncan enthused improbably. “I’ve only had very occasional issues with it.”

“Very convenient and handing” assessed Anna Jones incomprehensibly.

Google’s Chrome Store said the email address tied to the account that published the knockoff Microsoft extension also was responsible for one called “iArtbook Digital Painting.” Before it was removed from the Chrome Store iArtbook had garnered just 22 users and three reviews. As with the knockoff Microsoft extension all three reviews were positive and all were authored by accounts with first and last names like Megan Vance Olivia Knox and Alison Graham.

Google’s Chrome Store doesn’t make it easy to search by reviewer. For that I turned to Hao Nguyen the developer behind chrome-stats.com which indexes and makes searchable a broad array of attributes about extensions available from Google.

Looking at the Google accounts that left positive reviews on both the now-defunct Microsoft Authenticator and iArtbook extensions KrebsOnSecurity noticed that each left positive reviews on a handful of other extensions that have since been removed.

Like an ever-expanding venn diagram a review of the extensions commented on by each new fake reviewer found led to the discovery of even more phony reviewers and extensions. In total roughly 24 hours worth of digging through chrome-stats.com unearthed more than 100 positive reviews on a network of patently fraudulent extensions.

Those reviews in turn lead to the relatively straightforward identification of:

-39 reviewers who were happy with extensions that spoofed major brands and requested financial data

-45 malicious extensions that collectively had close to 100000 downloads

-25 developer accounts tied to multiple banned applications

The extensions spoofed a range of consumer brands including Adobe Amazon Facebook HBO Microsoft Roku and Verizon. Scouring the manifests for each of these other extensions in turn revealed that many of the same developers were tied to multiple apps being promoted by the same phony Google accounts.

Some of the fake extensions have only a handful of downloads but most have hundreds or thousands. A fake Microsoft Teams extension attracted 16200 downloads in the roughly two months it was available from the Google store. A counterfeit version of CapCut a professional video editing software suite claimed nearly 24000 downloads over a similar time period.

Unlike malicious browser extensions that can turn your PC into a botnet or harvest your cookies none of the extensions examined here request any special permissions from users. Once installed however they invariably prompt the user to provide personal and financial data — all the while pretending to be associated with major brand names.

In some cases the fake reviewers and phony extension developers used in this scheme share names such as the case with “brook ice” the Google account that positively reviewed the malicious Adobe and Microsoft Teams extensions. The email address brookice100@gmail.com was used to register the developer account responsible for producing two of the phony extensions examined in this review (PhotoMath and Dollify).

As we can see from the spreadsheet snippet above many of the Google accounts that penned positive reviews on patently bogus extensions left comments on multiple apps on the same day.

Additionally Google’s account recovery tools indicate many different developer email addresses tied to extensions reviewed here share the same recovery email — suggesting a relatively few number of anonymous users are controlling the entire scheme. When the spreadsheet data shown above is sorted by email address of the extension developer the grouping of the reviews by date becomes even clearer.

KrebsOnSecurity shared these findings with Google and will update this story in the event they respond. Either way Google somehow already detected all of these extensions as fraudulent and removed them from its store.

However there may be a future post here about how long that bad extension identification and removal process has taken over time. Overall most of these extensions were available for two to three months before being taken down.

As for the “so what?” here? I performed this research mainly because I could and I thought it was interesting enough to share. Also I got fascinated with the idea that finding fake applications might be as simple as identifying and following the likely fake reviewers. I’m positive there is more to this network of fraudulent extensions than is documented here.

As this story illustrates it pays to be judicious about installing extensions. Leaving aside these extensions which are outright fraudulent so many legitimate extensions get abandoned or sold each year to shady marketers that it’s wise to only trust extensions that are actively maintained (and perhaps have a critical mass of users that would make noise if anything untoward happened with the software).

According to chrome-stats.com the majority of extensions — more than 100000 of them — are effectively abandoned by their authors or haven’t been updated in more than two years. In other words there a great many developers who are likely to be open to someone else buying up their creation along with their user base.

My question is - her father owns a small business in Mexico in the field in which I am studying. If I was to receive employment from him (working remotely from the UK) what category would this count under?



If it was a UK business it would class a specified limited company but I'm not sure where to go from here...

If anyone could help I would much appreciate it!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA1LzMwL3ByZWRpY3Rpb24tdGhlc2Utd2lsbC1iZS0xMC1sYXJnZXN0LXN0b2Nrcy1ieS0yMDM1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prediction: These Will Be the 10 Largest Stocks by 2035,"Change is inevitable. The biggest stocks in the world by market cap will undoubtedly look a bit different in 14 years.

If there's one constant on Wall Street it's that nothing remains constant for long. The combination of technological innovation competitive advantages acquisitions and other tangible and intangible factors has a tendency to shake-up the world's largest companies on a regular basis.

For example in 2004 General Electric ExxonMobil Pfizer Citigroup Walmart BP AIG Intel and Bank of America were nine of the 10 largest publicly traded companies by market cap. None are still in the top 10 just 17 years later. In fact AIG isn't even in the top 250 anymore.

What might the top 10 look like in 2035? Frankly we don't know. But given a number of proliferating high-growth trends it won't stop me from making a prediction. In 14 years these are likely to be the world's 10 largest publicly traded companies presented in no particular order.

Amazon

Unless e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN 0.80%) decides to spin off its leading cloud infrastructure segment Amazon Web Services (AWS) I consider it to have the best chance of being the largest company by market cap in 2035. Amazon currently controls more than 40% of all online sales in the U.S. and it's signed up 200 million people to Prime worldwide. The fees it collects from Prime memberships help to ensure it can undercut brick-and-mortar retailers on price.

As for AWS it grew sales by 30% in 2020 (i.e. during the worst economic downturn in decades). AWS has a current run-rate of $54 billion in annual sales meaning it alone could fetch a valuation north of $600 billion and still be valued cheaply within the cloud space. Because AWS generates considerably higher margins than retail it's Amazon's key to a cash flow explosion in the years to come.

Microsoft

Despite a myriad of change since 1999 tech stock Microsoft (MSFT 0.43%) is the only company to remain in the top 10 by market cap in 1999 2004 2009 2014 2019 and currently. Thus it's a safe bet to suggest it'll hang onto a top-10 spot over the coming 14 years.

Although Microsoft is still generating plenty of cash flow from its legacy software and Windows operating system the cloud is its future. Cloud infrastructure service Azure along with enterprise and consumer cloud products across all of its core brands (Office Dynamics and Windows) can fuel sustainable double-digit or high single-digit growth for a long time to come.

Plus Microsoft is loaded with cash meaning it can use acquisitions as a means to boost its growth prospects and remain competitive.

Apple

Speaking of cash cows I believe Apple (AAPL 1.00%) remains safely in the top 10 even if its growth rate were to taper a bit. Keep in mind that Apple generated nearly $100 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing 12 months which means the company has an abundant cash pile to buy back its stock pay dividends reinvest in innovation and make the occasional acquisition to bolster its product portfolio.

In the years to come Tim Cook will continue to oversee Apple's transition to a services company. Subscription services boast higher margins than most products Apple sells and will help reduce the revenue lumpiness associated with tech replacement cycles.

Facebook

The social media space has proved especially fickle over the past 15 years so there's certainly the risk Facebook (META 0.60%) won't be one of the 10 largest companies by 2035. It could also be broken up by regulators which would potentially remove it from consideration.

However I chose to keep Facebook in the top 10 for two simple reasons. First it had 44% of the world's population visit one of its owned assets in the first quarter. This makes it unlikely that any social media company will unseat it in the eyes of advertisers anytime soon.

Second Facebook has only monetized two of its four prized assets (its namesake site and Instagram). When it decides to meaningfully monetize WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger it'll enjoy a massive multiyear growth spurt.

Alphabet

As with Facebook ad-driven operating models come with risks. Thankfully Alphabet (GOOGL 0.34%) (GOOG 0.24%) has ancillary operations and history on its side.

In terms of ancillary businesses streaming content provider YouTube has grown into a top-three social media destination and cloud infrastructure service Google Cloud now has an annual run-rate of more than $16 billion. Eventually Cloud is going to do for Alphabet what AWS has done (and will continue to do) for Amazon.

Meanwhile Alphabet's core business -- its Google internet search engine -- should benefit from long periods of economic expansion and the company's insane global share of internet search which has ranged from 91% to 93% for two years.

Airbnb

Perhaps the first big surprise is that I expect stay-and-hosting company Airbnb (ABNB -6.87%) to work its way into the top 10. That's because Airbnb is disrupting both the hotel stay side of the industry as well as the travel side of the equation.

At the moment Airbnb has 4 million hosts worldwide. This is just a fraction of what the platform is capable of handling given the more than 130 million residences in the U.S. and around 1 billion residences worldwide.

Airbnb has also been pushing its Experiences platform -- i.e. adventures led by local experts. Nothing can stop Airbnb from entrenching itself further in vacation experiences. We're witnessing the early innings of true leisure industry disruption.

Square

Fintech stock Square (SQ 2.90%) also has a very real opportunity to surpass PayPal over the next 14 years and work its way into the top 10.

Although Square should see steady growth from its seller ecosystem the company's primary driver will be peer-to-peer digital payments platform Cash App. In three years Cash App's monthly active user count has more than quintupled to 36 million. It's been a more popular download than PayPal's Venmo and Square has been generating $41 in gross profit per user compared to less than $5 in acquisition costs per user.

Square also completed the charter process to operate its own bank in March. This gives the company a full gamut of financial services it can offer in the high-margin digital banking space.

Visa

As of May 25 payment processing giant Visa (V 0.49%) was clinging the No. 10 spot with a $487 billion market cap $3 billion ahead of JPMorgan Chase. I believe in 14 years it'll still be clinging to a top-10 spot and likely pushing above a $1 trillion valuation.

Visa is a cyclical business which is a simple way of saying that it does really well when the U.S. and global economy are expanding and it struggles a bit when recession arise. However this is a numbers game Visa is well-prepared to play. Periods of expansion last significantly longer than contractions. What's more Visa isn't a lender which means it's not required to set aside cash for delinquent loans when recession strike. Thus why it bounces back so quickly from economic contractions.

With a majority of the world's transactions still conducted in cash Visa's growth runway extends decades into the future.

Berkshire Hathaway

In 14 years it's unlikely that Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are going to be running Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.61%) (BRK.B 0.60%) or dictating its investments. Thankfully Buffett has laid out a winning game plan for his successors that should result in continued growth.

Similar to the Visa growth thesis (Visa is one of Berkshire's four-dozen holdings) most of Buffett's investment portfolio is tied up in cyclical businesses. The Oracle of Omaha has always thrived on playing the numbers game and betting on multiyear periods of economic expansion. He also loves a good dividend stock which is why Coca-Cola and American Express have been so valuable.

The wildcard here will be investment lieutenants Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. If they maintain Buffett's long-term approach and avoid trying to time the market Berkshire Hathaway should be one of the 10 largest stocks come 2035.

Sea Limited

A final surprise that could find its way into the top 10 is Singapore-based Sea Limited (SE -1.14%). A veritable no-name a couple of years ago Sea has three extremely fast-growing businesses that could all help it reach a trillion-dollar valuation by 2035.

While mobile gaming is its primary generator of positive adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the time being it's e-commerce platform Shopee that'll be Sea's core sales and profit driver over the long run. ""But what about Amazon?"" you ask? Don't fret. Sea is primarily focused on emerging markets where the middle class is still taking shape. Sea and Amazon can thrive in their own separate niches.

Sea also has a nascent mobile wallet segment that could provide financial solutions to largely underbanked regions of Southeastern Asia. It has all the tools needed to be one of the world's largest companies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMizgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIxMDUyOTAwNTAwNy9lbi9HcmlkLUR5bmFtaWNzLUFjcXVpcmVzLVVLLUJhc2VkLVRhY2l0LUtub3dsZWRnZS1FbmhhbmNlcy1kaWdpdGFsLWNvbW1lcmNlLWNhcGFiaWxpdGllcy1hbmQtZXhwYW5kcy1kZWxpdmVyeS1mb290cHJpbnQtYWNyb3NzLVVLLVVTLU1leGljby1hbmQtTW9sZG92YdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grid Dynamics Acquires UK-Based Tacit Knowledge; Enhances digital commerce capabilities and expands delivery ...,"SAN RAMON Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Grid Dynamics Holdings Inc.

Araoluwa is the CEO of Aramanda a bespoke fashion brand founded in 2013 with a sense of style that can be described as an infusion of the ‘Old’ and ‘New’ Nigeria projecting enviable designs and tailoring standards to the world. The unique styles are peculiar to the brand and its development.

The Aramanda brand started in the city of Ibadan in his dad’s garage from the base in Ibadan. The brand is virtually capturing the imagination of both young and old clients especially the upwardly mobile and high-end clients in Lagos Abuja London Dubai United States of America Guadeloupe and so on.

With cutting edge fashion prowess and professionalism the Aramanda brand under Araoluwa has tailored Kings from varying corners of Nigeria dignitaries and public figures from the shores of Lagos to the United States of America.

Araoluwa got the brand more than a copious display on the annual Runway Dubai Fashion show since 2017.

On a journey of 7 years he has been able to put his brand Aramanda on the world map and he’s striving to compete more with international brands like LV Gucci Polo by Ralph and so on especially after just signing a manufacturing and partnership deal with HD Fashion Inc. New York as the Aramanda brand is starting its ready-to-wear-brand.

Aramanda didn’t just become the brand it has become today; Popoola went through a tough process of birthing this brand. Starting off for him was challenging as no one was willing to be a ‘guinea pig’ for a designer with no shop or clients. “Nigeria’s market embraces only popular designers; it’s very difficult for newbies to break in unless you have enough funds to expend to achieve visibility. Unfortunately I didn’t have that” he stated.

His biggest challenge was how he would be accepted as a rookie. Sourcing for tailors was also tough and as he narrated starting off in Ibadan also did not help matters. “The market is slow and tailors are not confident about its growth and possibilities but I had a dream stuck with it and pursued it! Today the world wants Aràmàndà.” Popoola explained.

The manufacturing deal with HD Fashion Inc. is indeed a big deal as it has projected not only Ibadan to the world but Nigeria too. With several negative perceptions on Nigeria this is indeed a positive one that is worthy of mention.

Araoluwa had always wanted to get into the American market but every time he tried he met a wall beginning from being denied visa to attend a fashion show in the US. He however did not give up but opted to get into the US market remotely from outside her shores by getting American celebrities to wear his brand.

“How did this happen?” You ask. Well his business partner Stan Mukoro made the connection and the rest as they say is history.

“Araoluwa is indeed living out his name which means the wonders of God. He is such a humble and focused young man and going into partnership with him was without hassles. Partnership means you bring something to the table and I do vice-versa. It is exactly what ours has been. I can’t wait for the world to see what the synergy between HD Fashion Inc and Aramanda births” Stan remarked.

Poopola certainly knew what he wanted to achieve and his partnership helped him to reach out to influential people to experience their designs. People like NAS Jeezy Jidenna Boris Kodjoe Jay Morrison President George Weah Kagwe Mungai Former President John Mahama Spotify’s Chaka Zulu the Ooni of Ife Kabiyesi Enitan Ogunwusi the Speaker of Nigeria’s House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila the Governor of Oyo State H.E. Seyi Makinde and a host of others.

Proud of his origin Araoluwa will tell you any day that he is proudly Nigerian. “Have you not met a Nigerian? We’re special resilient people. Yes I’m proud to be a Nigerian! Nigeria made me. Nigeria taught me to be who I am today. Honestly if you can survive here in all ways the world is yours to conquer.” He said.

And if you think he is only focused on male outfits you got it wrong because plans are already ongoing as the women’s line will begin before summer of 2022 because they are already in talks with a women’s clothing line that shares the Aramanda vision.

Popoola is grateful to the families of those in this vision with him for standing by them while they were on the road all the time to build a global brand. He is grateful to the customers who started and are still standing with the brand.

“I am also grateful to our legal team because after we worked assiduously to make it happen we consulted with a couple of law firms with experience in this space and we went with Uche Nwokedi & Co who then came up with a framework that would lend support and credibility to our creativity. The journey has just started and we look forward to serving new clients.” Araoluwa stated.",,,

Even if they’ve taken different paths” Elizabeth Berkley confesses in an EXCLUSIVE interview with HollywoodLife. But does this mean the high school frenemies-to-lovers who are now co-workers at Bayside High in the Saved by the Bell reboot have a chance at romantically reuniting as well in the revival’s second season? Elizabeth gave her honest thoughts on that as well while promoting her new partnership with Walgreens to promote Red Nose Day a campaign that is accepting donations here (and through the My Walgreens app and inside the retailer’s stores) to address the needs of children in poverty. The campaign runs up until May 31 and Elizabeth says that “one hundred percent of the donations are going back to help the cause.”

“There’s just you know — sometimes in life — there’s that person that you still have that connection and you saw a little bit of that toward the end of the season” Elizabeth teased in regards to whether Jessie and Slater will ever romantically reunite. She added “So I’m curious to see where that goes too. I know a lot and then there are things that I don’t know yet.”

Yes Jessie Spano was still a married woman when Season 1 of the Peacock reboot wrapped in November of 2020. However one huge moment indicated that things could be changing in Jessie’s personal life. The OG character who now works as a guidance counselor at Bayside High finally stood up to her “narcissistic fake-woke dreamcatcher tattoo-having homemade-jerky-smelling dumba–” husband Rene (Jessie’s words not ours). “I like where she’s going” Elizabeth said in regards to this jaw-dropping scene and her character’s future in Season 2.

“As a producer also of the show I’ve been privy to the storylines” Elizabeth continued. “Before hearing them out loud in the scripts. But I’m really liking the direction our writers are taking [Jessie]…I think fans will be happy I hope they’ll be happy but I think they will. I don’t want to give anything away.”

However Elizabeth was already happy with the development a “grown-up” Jessie was given in Season 1. It wasn’t far off from the personal and professional growth Elizabeth experienced herself by running self esteem workshops through Ask Elizabeth since the late aughts long after the original Saved by the Bell series concluded in 1993 (and the college spin-off series in 1994). The workshops bring girls in grades six to 12 a “safe space to feel heard and to know that they’re not alone” and by sharing this “collective experience” the young participants find there’s “a way to learn from each other and hold each other up and share wisdom even certain things that we may hold shame around that we think we’re the only ones kind of navigating” Elizabeth said.

Given this workshop work Elizabeth has taken on in addition to acting and producing she thought Jessie’s new role as a guidance counselor at Bayside High was “so perfect” when it was pitched to her by the reboot’s showrunner Tracy Wigfield. “It was kind of this perfect marriage of you know childhood Jessie grown-up Jessie and really reflecting in our culture today kind of what a lot of the kids are doing as advocates which is so amazing…Using their voice and being a megaphone for things that matter” Elizabeth said referring to the fact that Jessie was a proud feminist and activist — even when it wasn’t necessarily popular to be one — in the late ’80s/early ’90s setting of the original series.

While Jessie settles into this new role and “direction” going into Season 2 Elizabeth is also ecstatic to be on the same set with Mario Lopez (who plays A.C. Slater) Mark-Paul Gosselaar (Zac Morris) Tiffani Thiessen (Kelly Kapowski) and Lark Voorhies (Lisa Turtle) all these years later. “It’s really the best. It’s like being home…there’s a comfort and an ease and support” Elizabeth gushed about the cast reunion after just getting back from a “very very fun” table read for Season 2 with the cast hours before this interview.

While Walgreens isn’t giving out red noses this year you can try on a digital red nose by donating to Red Nose Day — just like Elizabeth Berkley did above! [Instagram/@elizabethberkley]

“Whenever [the original stars are] there I just — I crack up because honestly as we’re reading through the scripts I know how it’s going to come out of their mouth before they say it. And it makes me laugh because they’re so talented” Elizabeth explained. “And when you know someone so well you can already hear it in your head. And we just we were laughing so hard [at the table read]. It was really fun.” You can expect to join in on the laughter when Season 2 comes out as we keep dreaming of Jessie and Slater to finally be together!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXJpbGxvLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA1LzMwL3JpdmVyLXJvYWQtaXNkLWdyYWR1YXRpb24vNTI3NjM3NDAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,River Road ISD Graduation,"NEWS

Coleman Thomas Blevins 28 popped up on the KCSO radar last week so the office reached out to Blevins. According to the KCSO it confirmed Blevins was planning a mass shooting after speaking with him.

In a message KCSO intercepted Blevins allegedly threatened to shoot up a Walmart which location was not released.

Blevins was arrested Friday on a Terroristic Threat warrant then officials got to work on a search warrant at his home.

There deputies say they found firearms ammo electronic evidence concentrated THC and “radical ideology paraphernalia” which they said included books flags and handwritten documents.

We are told Blevins is on active felony probation which means he is prohibited from having guns. He remains in jail.

“This case reminds us that we need to always be vigilant. Many think ‘that can’t happen here’ and it was well on the way to happening” Sheriff Larry Leitha said. “Our investigators did outstanding work in this case and possibly saved many lives. The plot interrupted in this case is unthinkable. We appreciate the assistance of all our law enforcement partners including the FBI DPS KPD and Secret Service. We’d like to remind the public - if you see something say something. The KCSO working with other law enforcement professionals will continue to stop threats to our community and bring those responsible to prosecution.”

The company also was the highest-ranked retailer on Diversity Inc.'s Top 50 Companies for Diversity list placing 32nd a Walmart spokeswoman said Thursday.

Walmart's workplace policies and resources as well as its philanthropic gifts to LGBT organizations factored into the rankings according to Diversity Inc.

A media and marketing firm in New Jersey Diversity Inc. gathers data from the world's major corporations. With that information it develops software that companies can use to achieve their diversity goals with their workforce and suppliers.

The annual Top 50 list is drawn from corporate survey submissions according to the company's website. The same data gathered from the surveys is used to determine the top specialty lists in categories such as people with disabilities; talent acquisition for women of color; supplier diversity; and philanthropy.

Walmart's spokeswoman also pointed out that the Bentonville-based retailer earned a 100% rating on the 2021 Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index a national benchmarking tool on corporate policies and practices pertaining to LGBT employees. In addition the company was designated a 2021 Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality.

Despite all the kudos though a study by the employment website Glassdoor.com suggests some LGBT employees at Walmart aren't as happy there as their non-LGBT counterparts.

Last year Glassdoor said it began allowing users to voluntarily -- and anonymously -- put their demographic information on their profiles. When users wrote reviews about a current or former employer they were asked to give the company a 1- to 5-star ""Diversity & Inclusion Rating.""

The reviews can be filtered by the reported demographic characteristics.

When Walmart's reviews are filtered for sexual orientation the results show that the 84 respondents identifying themselves as LGBT gave the company an average rating of 2.7 stars. In contrast more than 400 respondents who identified themselves as heterosexual gave Walmart 3.2 stars.

Ratings were based on six workplace factors: career opportunities; compensation; culture; diversity and inclusion; senior leadership; and work-life balance. Over all the companies LGBT employees were most unhappy with senior leadership followed by career opportunities and compensation.

The number of respondents who chose to reveal their sexual orientation is small making it difficult to draw a definitive conclusion from the ratings.

In Walmart's 2020 Culture Diversity Equity and Inclusion Report issued in April Walmart outlined a number of actions it has taken to foster diversity and inclusion companywide.

For instance Walmart once again awarded a grant to PFLAG National an organization for LGBT people and their parents families and allies.

The company also sponsored the Ad Council's 2020 Love Has No Labels campaign. According to its website Love Has No Labels is ""a movement to promote acceptance and inclusion of all people across race religion gender sexual orientation age and ability.""

Walmart also has what it calls ""Associate Resource Groups"" that represent different segments of the company's more than 1.5 million U.S. workers. For more than 15 years these groups have worked to foster an inclusive environment in the workplace; attract and retain diverse talent; and enhance Walmart's reputation in the communities it serves.

Associate resource groups include Walmart Pride. Group members advise the company on policy and participate in Pride events around the country. Besides growing in the U.S. the group has helped establish others in some of the company's international markets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8zMC91cy90ZXhhcy1hcnJlc3QtYWxsZWdlZC1tYXNzLXNob290aW5nLXBsYW4vaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBTWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjEvMDUvMzAvdXMvdGV4YXMtYXJyZXN0LWFsbGVnZWQtbWFzcy1zaG9vdGluZy1wbGFu?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas man arrested over alleged plans for mass shooting at Walmart,"CNN —

Law enforcement officials have arrested a Texas man who they say was planning a “mass casualty event” possibly at a Walmart.

Coleman Thomas Blevins 28 of Kerrville was arrested Friday “on a warrant for a Terroristic Threat to Create Public Fear of Serious Bodily Injury” according to a news release from the Kerr County Sheriff’s Office (KCSO).

Multiple agencies worked together for a week to intercept and foil the plan for an attack on the public the release said including the Texas Department of Public Safety Criminal Investigations Division the FBI the Kerrville Police Department and the US Secret Service.

“Through the period of investigation KCSO investigators made contact and conversed with Mr. Blevins confirmed his affiliation and (his) networking with extremist ideologies” the sheriff’s office said.

“On May 27th KCSO Special Operations Division intercepted a message indicating that Blevins was preparing to proceed with a mass shooting. In the message Mr. Blevins made a specific threat that included WalMart. Working with the FBI KCSO Investigators confirmed Mr. Blevins’ capability of following through with the threat and moved immediately to arrest him” it said.

After Blevins’ arrest authorities searched his home and said they found various items including firearms and ammunition.

“In that warrant service firearms ammunition electronic evidence concentrated THC and radical ideology paraphernalia including books flags and handwritten documents were seized. Mr. Blevins is currently on active felony probation and is prohibited from possessing firearms” the news release from the sheriff’s office said.

Authorities may seek federal charges

Blevins was booked in the Kerr County jail where he remains on a $250000 bond according to authorities.

CNN has not determined whether Blevins has a lawyer.

“The FBI or other federal authorities may seek federal charges in this case” the news release said.

Eighty years ago today picket lines destroyed the facade of the magical world of Disney. The strike by Disney cartoonists and animators on May 29 1941 forever changed the labor standards of an industry — and inspired a segment of cultural workers to take greater ownership over their labor.

Walt Disney snarled at strikers as he walked into his Burbank studio; workers in turn hollered back. Workers that crossed the picket line were called “finks” and “scabs” while those on strike were dismissed as “Commies.”

This wasn’t your average picket line. “It’s up to Walt to call the halt” read a striking worker’s picket sign beside a picture of Mickey Mouse. Another featured an image of Pinocchio saying “There are no strings on me.”

“Do Something About It”

Just a few years before the strike Walt Disney enjoyed not only commercial success but a relatively happy workforce. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which premiered in December 1937 was a box-office smash. Disney’s work was compared to Charlie Chaplin’s in terms of its importance for American culture.

Disney artists were among the best paid and enjoyed a familial if paternalistic work environment. Disney made it a practice to share 20 percent of his profits with employees as bonuses. The studio even had an internal art school to train its own animators. Most Disney animators viewed themselves as a class above the rest in their field.

World War II dramatically changed the situation. In 1937 Disney started constructing a studio in Burbank California financed on credit with the assumption of continuous success. But the war destroyed the European market for his films. Pinocchio and Fantasia were box-office failures in 1940 and Disney was soon $4.5 million in debt.

He sought to recoup these losses through ramping up pressure on his workers. The intimate familial environment was quickly gone from the studio in Burbank. Strict hierarchies were established with most benefits only going to the highest-paid and more established artists. Most new artists did routine dull tasks and received $20 per week while the senior artists got to do more creative work and could make up to $250 per week.

Workers were also forced to sign documents claiming they only worked forty hours a week when they in fact worked much more. And cartoonists wanted professional screen credits for their art as they claimed Disney often took credit for their work.

In a 1991 interview animator Willis Pyle said of the time “I felt that the union was necessary because there was no rhyme or reason as to the way the guys were paid. You might be sitting next to a guy doing the same thing as you and you might be getting $20 a week more or less than him.”

In January 1941 the Screen Cartoonists Guild (SCG) led by Herb Sorrell began meeting regularly at the Hollywood Hotel to gather grievances and plan an organizing drive. SCG organizers felt that organizing Disney would also help force the hand of other studio union holdouts like MGM. Oblivious to the depths of the workers’ discontent Walt Disney’s response only further strengthened the unions’ position.

In February all studio workers were called to an auditorium by Disney. He explained that due to his debts he couldn’t increase wages. His artists would need to work quicker to increase their output. This was accompanied by a condescending reminder that his workers still had it good as he offered training vacations and paid sick time. Many of the newer employees left the meeting calling the speech a “sob story.”

By this time Art Babbitt one of Disney’s top animators was playing a leading role in the union drive. He was responsible for iconic Disney characters like Goofy the evil stepmother in Snow White and Geppetto in Pinocchio. Previously he had been an executive in Disney’s sham company union the Federation of Screen Cartoonists. Company unions such as these were often used by employers to co-opt worker discontent and falsely claim to represent them.

Babbitt became frustrated at the inability to make change from that position. As a more senior artist many of the grievances didn’t personally affect him but he was driven by loyalty to his coworkers and a sense of principle. Walt viewed Babbitt’s union activity as a personal betrayal.

As the union drive gathered steam Disney assembled all his workers again for another lecture. He remained intransigent and reiterated his position that anyone who wanted to advance at the company had every opportunity to do so.

“Put your own house in order. You can’t accomplish a damn thing by sitting around and waiting to be told everything. If you’re not progressing as you should instead of grumbling and growling do something about it” Disney told them. Workers yet again left the meeting furious — and even more motivated to join the Screen Cartoonists Guild.

The last straw came when Disney fired Art Babbitt and twenty-three other cartoonists. Union leader Herb Sorrell wanted to lay the groundwork with more organizing before calling a strike but the enraged workers didn’t want to wait. The strike began on May 29 during the production of Dumbo.

Only about half of the one thousand cartoonists walked out. Still on day one Disney took pictures of the picket line and enlarged the photos for workers who came into the studio. He made sure they knew that he was aware of every individual striker and would be able to know those that joined them in the future. Seemingly unmoved by the workers’ escalation he continued asserting that the workers were already fairly represented by the company union.

Many of the workers had no experience in the labor movement and simply didn’t understand how intense the conflict would become. Animator Jack Kinney remembers “those of us who crossed the picket line were in shock. We were naive having never been exposed to the workings of capital and labor.”

Outside the studio building the picket lines assumed a carnivalesque character. Cartoonists poured their creative energy into making signs and anti-Disney puns. Sorrell recalled in the PM newspaper “It was particularly picturesque because these artists insisted on depicting everything in their picket lines . . . it was their duty when off the picket line to make gags and signs.”

Solidarity poured in from other unions in the entertainment industry. The Society of Motion Picture Film Editors supported the strike by refusing to process Disney films at the Technicolor Williams and Pathé labs. Supporting organizations such as the League of Women Shoppers and Film Audiences for Democracy picketed theaters showing Disney films. Cartoonists returned the solidarity to other unions for example making picket signs for the United Auto Workers North American Aviation strike in Los Angeles.

As the strike wore on Disney became increasingly bitter and viewed the whole event as a personal assault. Despite there being very few leftists in the SCG Disney published a letter in Variety claiming that “Communist agitation leadership and activities have brought about this strike.”

An opportunity to remove himself from the strike arose when the Rockefeller Commission for the Development of Cultural Relations with South America made Disney a “Goodwill Ambassador” taking him on a tour throughout the continent. But his troubles continued. SCG business agent Bill Pomerance reached out to the National Maritime Union and was given contacts of all union leaders in the cities Disney was scheduled to visit.

Pomerance sent a telegram to the US State Department saying “Labor organizations in South America are being contacted and arrangements are being made to picket the Disney tour and his pictures. . . . The State Department should insist that the Disney company comply with American standards of fair treatment of labor . . . before permitting Disney to represent the United States as a goodwill ambassador in South America.”

This move forced the hand of the government’s Labor Conciliation Service which stepped in and called both sides to Washington DC to work out an agreement. The settlement was an overall victory for the union and included the permanent reinstatement of the twenty-four employees fired before the strike equalization of pay a clear system of salaries and classifications and a grievance procedure.

The 1941 strike forever changed the labor standards of the animation industry. For many of the younger artists their salaries doubled overnight and a forty-hour workweek was established. From then on animators received screen credits for their work as well as pensions and health insurance benefits.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd2R3bnQuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvcGhvdG9zLXdhbHQtZGlzbmV5cy1jYXJvdXNlbC1vZi1wcm9ncmVzcy1pbi1tYWdpYy1raW5nZG9tLW5vdy1zZWF0aW5nLWd1ZXN0cy1pbi1ldmVyeS1yb3cv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PHOTOS: Walt Disney's Carousel of Progress in Magic Kingdom Now Seating Guests in Every Row,"Walt Disney’s Carousel of Progress has modified its health the safety procedures.

And depending on what type of hotel accommodations you’re looking for you might stumble upon some rooms that will cost you a pretty penny per night. So whether you’re willing to pay the extra price or you’re just curious how much Disney is willing to charge for a hotel room we’re covering the most expensive rooms you’ll find in Disney World!

Treehouse Villas at Saratoga Springs

Have you ever dreamed of staying in a treehouse? Well you can make it happen at Disney World! The Treehouse Villas are located at Disney’s Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa and can make you feel like you’re far far away from all the hustle and bustle.

Located in a wood-like area on the Sassagoula River these treehouses sleep up to 9 people with 3 bedrooms 2 bathrooms a living/dining/kitchen area and a porch.

But the rustic vibes and giant space come at a price — the Treehouse Villas range in price from $964-$1838 per night so you might need 9 friends to chip in if you’re going to make this one sound affordable.

Presidential and VP Suites

The next most expensive room at Disney World is actually rooms (well suites) and can be found at many Deluxe Resorts — the Presidential and VP Suites. These will give you that traditional hotel room stay experience but you’ll have a LOT more room to spare (some of them are as big as a house!).

The average price for these suites is about $3000 per night but you can find some priced MUCH higher (like those at Disney’s Contemporary Resort which cost up to $5200 per night during holidays and Disney’s Animal Kingdom Lodge which start at $5300 per night).

The Polynesian Villa Bora Bora Bungalows

We’re starting to really get up there in pricing now and for this one we’re headed over to Disney’s Polynesian Village Resort. This hotel is already pretty pricey as it is but you can tack on some extra cost to forego a stay in any of the main buildings and stay in a Bora Bora Bungalow on the Seven Seas Lagoon.

These “rooms” are priced between $2779 to $5253 a night depending on when you’re planning your visit and sleep up to 8 people. They feature 2 bedrooms 2 bathrooms a living/dining/kitchen area and a private back deck with a plunge pool. Plus they’ve got a great view of Magic Kingdom and fireworks when they’re happening.

The Cabins at Copper Creek Villas at Disney’s Wilderness Lodge

Over at Disney’s Wilderness Lodge you can find another expensive hotel room in the Disney Vacation Club portion of the hotel. The Cascade Cabins include 2 bedrooms 2 bathrooms a GIANT living/dining/kitchen area a private screened porch with hot tub and enough space to house up to 8 people.

But a room with a hot tub doesn’t come cheap — the lowest price you can stay in these is $2238 per night with the highest pricing costing $4173 per night.

3 Bedroom Grand Villas

Another room type that you’ll be paying the cost for all the extra space is the 3 Bedroom Grand Villas that are part of select Disney Vacation Club properties in Disney World. These rooms can sleep up to 12 (!!) people and generally feature 3 bedrooms at least 3 bathrooms a full-sized kitchen living/dining area and balcony.

Depending on which resort you’re looking to stay in and what dates you’re planning your trip for these villas can cost somewhere between $2500 to $4000 on average with some costing even more (or less).

Cinderella Castle Suite

And ringing in at the top of our most expensive rooms at Disney World list is a room that you actually can’t pay to stay in — the Cinderella Castle Suite. This room is situated inside of Cinderella Castle in Magic Kingdom and you actually have to be invited or win a contest to be able to stay a night.

But you can pay to tour the space that accommodates up to 6 people has a “magic mirror” TV stained glass windows an antique limestone fireplace and a Jacuzzi tub — it’ll just cost you $12000 as an add on to the World of Dreams Tour. So this may be the most expensive room in Disney World that you can’t actually stay in!

Want to skip the long lines for rides and food at Disneyland or Walt Disney World? As the old saying goes be careful what you wish for - because you might get it.

With virtual queues and mobile ordering Disney has created app-based alternatives to the long physical lines that used to frustrate visitors. Instead of standing behind other guests to order food at a register now you can use the mobile order feature on the official Disneyland or Walt Disney World app to place your order and pay. Instead of lining up in an endless queue of people waiting to get on a ride now you can use the virtual queue in Disney's apps to claim a space in line on popular attractions such as Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance Indiana Jones Adventure and soon the new Web Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure.

But while these features allow you to avoid time standing in a physical line they don't necessarily make your wait any shorter. In practice they're actually increasing the amount of time that many guests are waiting for their food or thrills. When fans asked Disney for a way to avoid long line the finger on the monkey's paw curled and we got these new app-based alternatives.

Yes mobile order and virtual queues can be easy to use. With mobile order the whole family can take their time looking at the menu deciding what they want then communicating that information directly to a restaurant's kitchen with no risk of a cashier not getting your intended order right. You can decide what to order whenever you want then skip the line and pick up your meal at your convenience. In an attraction's virtual queue it's just a click or two on your phone to claim a spot in line without having to rush across the park and steel yourself for a long wait on your feet. Just wait for your turn to be called via a notification on the app and you're heading straight in.

Seems easy right? Well they might be too easy.

How many times have you seen a long line for a restaurant and ride and said to yourself ""forget it. That's too long. We'll try something else."" Long physical waits deter people from going to overloaded restaurants and attractions distributing guests to alternatives with more available capacity. That helps even the load around a park.

But visitors generally don't care about the greater good of efficient guest loading across a theme park. No one is paying Disney ticket prices to be part of some grand industrial engineering challenge. People want what they want. They just want to get on that ride or order that food that they wanted in the first place.

So Disney found ways to give them access to that. But removing the deterrent effect of long physical queues only added to the demand for rides and restaurants without increasing their capacity. That's why almost everyone visiting Disneyland or Disney's Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort now starts their day before 7am frantically reloading the page on the official park app trying to catch it exactly at 7am when they can submit their request to join the virtual queue for Rise of the Resistance.

Disney's app has no way of knowing which fans would gladly have waited four hours in a physical queue for the award-winning Star Wars ride and who's just trying to get a spot in the queue on a lark because it only takes a click and people told them it was a great ride. The virtual queue system pays no attention to who's on the final day of their Disney vacation and has not yet gotten the chance to ride and someone's who's been on Rise dozens of times already and is just looking for another go.

There's no merit to the selection process. And with nearly everyone with a reservation to visit that day trying to enter the queue at once who gets in and who does not is pretty much just a random-chance lottery. For those who lose that lottery Disney's system to make waiting in line easier has made getting on a popular attraction impossible.

It's less dire for restaurants' mobile order but still frustrating. Before the pandemic when relatively few people used Disney's mobile order system it worked wonderfully. Those who knew to use it could skip long food queue and get their meals pretty much on demand. But with mobile order now mandatory at many quick service restaurants kitchens are getting slammed with orders just before mealtimes - many more orders than cashiers would be able to take manually in a physical queue. And many more orders than a restaurant would get with a physical line out the door.

To ease the burden on the kitchen Disney then asks guests using mobile order to select a later pick-up time so that the kitchen can clear the orders it already has. As a result if you want to eat lunch at noon instead of 1:30pm you need to get your order in before the rush. But every day it seems that the time you need to place your order to get ahead of that rush moves up earlier and earlier. We've heard that for some popular restaurants you might now need to get your mobile order in before 10am if you want any chance to snag a pick-up time before 1pm.

A system that was designed to help people avoid a 20-to-30-minute wait in a physical line has left them in an up-to-three-hour wait in a virtual one instead.

With so many restaurants using mobile order there's still a deterrent effect that drives guests to other less-crowded locations helping to smooth demand. It's just that well-informed fans are now having to decide about where to eat lunch as soon as they get to the park in the morning rather than just before noon as they might have before. Poorly informed fans are walking around hungry and frustrated at lunch time though.

With pandemic restrictions lifting should Disney retreat from mobile order allowing walk-up in-person ordering at more restaurants? Should it further limit the number of mobile orders it takes per 15-minute period to accommodate walk-in orders? Or will more Disney fans just have to learn to place their mobile orders early in the day as they once learned to make early Fastpass and dining reservations?

And what to about virtual queues? Could adding virtual queues to more attractions actually reduce the load on Rise of the Resistance? It hasn't helped at Disneyland where the park is allowing visitors to join both the Rise and Indy queues at the same time. Allowing people to wait for multiple rides at once just further increases demand making the whole mess even worse.

To reduce the demand for Rise Disney would need to force fans to decide whether to try for the Star Wars ride's virtual queue or the virtual queue for another attraction. That way some fans who'd been on Rise before - or who don't care that much about Star Wars - might choose to go for an easy return time on another attraction instead of trying for the free shot at another trip on Rise that the current system allows them to take.

Or Disney could bring back the deterrent effect while giving the most desperate Star Wars fans a shot at riding by further limiting the number of available spots in the Rise virtual queue and establishing a walk-up queue that would get a certain number of rides per hour. Of course Disney's basically had that system for years. It's Fastpass.

Now Fastpass has created similar demand-and-supply problems over the years but Disney could help alleviate those by returning Walt Disney World to the ""one at a time policy"" that Disneyland had before the pandemic led Disney to pause the system on both coasts. Or Disney could leave Fastpass on the sidelines and adopt virtual queues for all attractions whenever they have a wait - so long as guests could wait in only virtual queue at a time.

That's a fascinating scenario to game out. But it might just accelerate many guests' feeling that visiting a Disney theme park is becoming a mobile video game where you have to make every move on Disney's app before you can do anything in the park itself.

Maybe we shouldn't have wished to get out of those long lines after all.

NBCUniversal and Lionsgate

Buying Lionsgate would help Comcast's NBCUniversal on two different fronts. First it would add more content to Peacock NBCUniversal's subscription video service. Lionsgate owns shows including ""Mad Men"" ""Orange is the New Black"" ""Nashville"" and ""Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist."" Lionsgate currently licenses those shows to a grab bag of streaming services. Second Lionsgate owns premium network Starz which would fit seamlessly with NBCUniversal's offerings. NBCUniversal doesn't have a premium network unlike competitors WarnerMedia (HBO) and ViacomCBS (Showtime). On the streaming front a Starz-Peacock combination -- either together as one service or separately as a bundled offering -- could expand NBCUniversal's global aspirations. Starz is on track to have 60 million global subscribers by 2025 Chief Executive John Feltheimer said this week. Starz is already available in 58 different countries which would give Peacock a head start in its expansion aspirations. And Lionsgate wouldn't cost much with a market capitalization of just $3.8 billion (an an enterprise value of about $6.4 billion). If Comcast is going to keep NBCUniversal -- bucking AT&T's decision to give up on vertical integration -- buying Lionsgate would be a sensible move to stay competitive in the streaming wars without breaking the bank.

WarnerMedia-Discovery and ViacomCBS

There's already speculation about a potential future merger between the newly created WarnerMedia-Discovery entity (assuming the deal closes) and NBCUniversal. Discovery's controlling shareholder John Malone said on CNBC how the combined company could be open to a future merger with NBCUniversal if regulatory forces would allow it. But the divestments that might have to take place could be too complicated and tax-inefficient for that combination to occur. Regulators might not allow CNN and MSNBC to be housed under one corporate roof. Combining Comcast's Universal and WarnerMedia's Warner Bros. -- the No. 2 and No. 3 largest film studios by box office revenue in 2019 and 2018 the last full years of theatrical releases -- may also be a non-starter. The more logical combination would be WarnerMedia-Discovery and ViacomCBS . Shari Redstone's company has a broadcast network -- CBS. WarnerMedia-Discovery doesn't so that's a fit. (The combination of CBS and NBC under one roof would be one major roadblock to a ViacomCBS-NBCUniversal merger.) Unlike NBCUniversal ViacomCBS doesn't have a large cable news network. That makes keeping CNN more viable. While ViacomCBS also owns a movie studio Paramount has been a much smaller box office presence than Universal in recent years. Among global film studios Paramount was sixth in box office revenue in both 2018 and 2019. Putting together Paramount and Warner Bros. would be an easier sell for antitrust concerns. The biggest complication would be if Redstone is willing to give up or dilute her controlling ViacomCBS shares. That's what Malone did to push Discovery and WarnerMedia together so there's now a template.

Disney and AMC Networks

This is the hardest sell. Disney doesn't really need AMC Networks . It's doing perfectly fine with the content it has. But with Disney-owned Hulu licensing so much of its content it's vulnerable to losing some of its hit shows. MGM for example makes ""The Handmaid's Tale."" Now that Amazon has acquired MGM it's unclear if the series will remain on Hulu once that deal closes. The owner of ""The Walking Dead"" IFC Films and Sundance Now could provide an adult-themed content boost to Hulu. That would balance out the robust kids' offering on Disney+ and sports on ESPN+. AMC has forecast it will have at least 9 million streaming subscribers by the end of 2021 and 25 million by the end of 2025. That's a far cry from Hulu's current 41.6 million or Disney+'s 103.6 million but it's evidence that there's at least some audience for the programming. And while cable is slowly dying it's not dead yet with about 85 million U.S. households still subscribing to some form of bundled linear TV. Disney's ESPN remains the lifeblood of the traditional pay-TV bundle. Bundling AMC Networks' cable networks with ESPN would protect affiliate fees as pay-TV providers have always been loathe to drop ESPN. The Dolan Family controls AMC Networks. The Dolans have likely known for years that AMC Networks is subscale and should combine with a bigger media fish. If the Dolans don't want to sell they won't. But AMC Networks is relatively tiny at $2.2 billion in market valuation and about $4 billion in enterprise value. Disney could easily buy the company in cash. However Disney's previous acquisitions -- Pixar Marvel Lucas Films -- have been for intellectual property. Does AMC Networks own enough valuable IP to make a deal worth it for shareholders? And is that IP family-friendly enough to mesh with the company's theme park business? That may be why a Disney-AMC deal hasn't already happened.

(SIMI VALLEY Calif.) –Today 189 workers at Waste Management Inc. (WMI) voted overwhelmingly by a more than 2-1 margin in favor of joining Teamsters Local 186 in Ventura Calif. The Southern California waste workers are seeking improved working conditions better wages and stronger benefits.

The vote for union representation capped more than a yearlong organizing drive by workers at the company’s Simi Valley Landfill and Recycling Center and marked the first time that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has approved an in-person election since issuing new voting rules in response to the pandemic in November.

“It feels great to finally and officially say that we are Teamsters. We fought hard for this day” said Jesus Orozco a WMI worker and member of the worker-led Justicieros Organizing Committee. “Now we will continue fighting to bargain a contract that guarantees fairness and respect for every worker.”

The WMI workers provide trash and recycling services in the San Fernando Valley including the towns of Reseda Calabasas and Hidden Hills.

“We are thankful for the support we have received from the community and we are grateful to have the Teamsters standing behind us the entire time. It reminded us that this was a campaign for justice” said Jorge Avalos a WMI worker and a leading voice on the organizing committee. “Now that we are Teamsters we will continue to fight and win. We are stronger and more united than ever as we head into negotiations for our first union contract.”

Despite the anti-union campaign waged by the company WMI workers stayed united in their campaign to secure a union voice at the Simi Valley facility.

“This determined group stood strong as the company waged a vicious anti-union campaign going so far as to hire union busters in a desperate attempt to convince workers to vote against their best interests. These workers knew better than to fall for their dirty tricks” said Abel Garcia Principal Officer of Local 186. “It wasn’t only the workers who united against the company’s union busters but their spouses and children also took part in the fight. Together they stood strong for the betterment of their entire family. I have been a Teamster for more than 40 years and this campaign is unlike any I’ve ever seen. It reminded me of when I was teenager watching Cesar Chavez. This is a victory that will go down in the books.”

Local 186 is already preparing to bargain the WMI workers a first contract. In addition to improved pay and benefits the workers are also seeking respect on the job and safer working conditions.

“On behalf of the Teamsters Waste Division I want to congratulate Simi Valley workers on their overwhelming victory at Waste Management today. Our division is proud of what they have accomplished throughout the campaign for Teamster representation. These workers now have a more secure future under a strong union voice” said Chuck Stiles Director of the Teamsters Solid Waste and Recycling Division.

The Teamsters Solid Waste and Recycling Division represents thousands of WMI workers at locations nationwide.

Here's what we can do about it.,"Anna Chott

Litter has been cited as a major issue by many residents and businesses in Fayetteville. It can affect the experience of people visiting the city as well as the quality of life of residents.

In Fayetteville alone litter crews collect more than two tons of litter each week from public areas and roadways. The City of Fayetteville and Cumberland County are looking at creative ways to combat this issue.

Successful campaigns to reduce litter can involve enforcement of fines for littering increased participation in clean-up efforts by residents and a reduction in companies’ disposable packaging. A study by Keep America Beautiful found that in the United States there are 152 pieces of trash in the environment for every person. The study also found that the presence of litter reduces the property value of a home by just over 7%.

Plastics are particularly detrimental to the environment and wildlife because they can break down into small pieces and fish and other animals ingest the pieces. Our water supply is treated before it is sent to our taps but pollution of the watershed by litter can make it harder and more expensive to treat water and can even make it unsuitable for consumption.

Letter:Fill out survey to help assess health needs in Cumberland County

The problem of litter may seem overwhelming and may currently outweigh the financial and human resources available to combat it but there is good reason to have hope that we can reduce the litter in Fayetteville. The Keep America Beautiful study found that roadside litter has decreased by 54% nationwide in the past decade.

Fayetteville and Cumberland County residents can be a part of the solution by using less disposable packaging supporting businesses that eliminate disposable items reporting instances of littering and volunteering at city-wide clean-up events. Perhaps the most immediate impact residents can have is by volunteering at the City of Fayetteville’s monthly pop-up clean-ups in highly littered areas.

They can also participate in the 5 For Friday reverse litter campaign a collaborative effort between the city Cumberland County and Sustainable Sandhills. Anyone can take the 5 For Friday pledge to collect five pieces of litter and drop them in a trash can or recycling bin every Friday. Information about both of these opportunities can be found at 5forfriday.org.

Report littering illegal dumping

Many residents also do not realize how important it is to report instances of littering and illegal dumping. The FayFixIt app has a “Swat a Litterbug” button where residents can report the license plate number of someone they observe littering. This tool can be used to report cases of litter flying out of truck beds which often results in litter along roadways.

North Carolina law requires that trash carried in the backs of trucks be secure. In addition residents can report instances of illegal dumping by calling the Environmental Hotline at 910-438-4075. Fines for littering in Fayetteville or Cumberland County range from $100 to $2000 and can include community service work.

In order to deter littering the City has created the RAPID team (Removing And Preventing Illegal Dumping). Composed of employees of the City Development Services Department-Code Enforcement Division this team’s sole purpose is to prevent investigate and remove illegally dumped materials.

Here in Fayetteville TVs mattresses furniture and other items often end up dumped on private property even though the city offers a service to pick them up and dispose of them for free. Those who live in a home or multi-family residence in Fayetteville can call 910-433-1329 for free pickup of almost any item.

Those who live outside of Fayetteville can utilize the county’s 16 container sites listed at the bottom of this article to dispose of bulky waste items. Furniture mattresses and construction debris can only be disposed of at the Ann Street Landfill.

Letter:Scholarships awarded for Friendship House Fayetteville

Residents looking to dispose of usable furniture and household items can reach out to the Restore Warehouse (910-321-0780) or Fayetteville Area Habitat for Humanity Restore (fayettevillenchabitat.org or 910-920-4657) for free pickup. Both of these organizations accept furniture appliances cabinetry sinks doors and windows.

It is significantly more sustainable to buy used furniture and construction materials from one of these locations rather than purchasing new items. Sustainable Sandhills can provide assistance in finding legal disposal for any other item by emailing info@sustainablesandhills.org or calling 910-484-9098.

My fellow members of the Sustainable Sandhills team and I encourage residents to reduce their use of disposable materials. Shop with reusable bags choose reusable bottles over bottled water and encourage local businesses to do the same to slow the enormous increase of trash on our planet. After all there is no planet B!

NurPhoto | NurPhoto | Getty Images

Humans generate a remarkable amount of garbage: over 2 billion tonnes per year according to the World Bank or approximately 4.5 trillion pounds annually. And that figure is going to grow. Global garbage is expected to reach 3.4 billion tonnes by 2050. Even if you could figure out where to put that much garbage it's going to leak dangerous greenhouse gasses that contribute to climate change. Solid waste landfills are the third-largest source of methane emissions in the United States according to the most recent data available from the Environmental Protection Agency. In 2019 landfills released 15% of methane emissions which is equivalent to emissions from more than 21.6 million passenger cars driven for one year. Recycling is no panacea. And furthermore there's a wide gap between what's possible to be recycled and what actually is recycled. Dry recyclables such as plastic paper and cardboard metal and glass are equal to 38% of municipal waste according to data in the World Bank's What a Waste 2.0 report. Meanwhile only 13.5% of those dry recyclables are actually recycled globally. Technology companies are trying to tackle the garbage problem from multiple directions improving recycling processes and creating new materials to make single-use products that are compostable. The U.S. waste industry can use the help. Richer countries do a better job of recycling than poorer countries but the United States isn't near the top of the list recycling 34.6% of its garbage. While poor countries on average only recycle 3.7% and many don't recycle at all or don't have data some of the best rates are in Europe and especially among some of the smallest territories such as The Faroe Islands a self-governing archipelago which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark which is No. 1 in the world recycling 67% of its garbage.

Recycling cost profits and automation

""The basic principles of recycling are the collection sorting manual and or mechanical processing and then delivery of the required quality of recycled materials to manufacturing industries"" Ross Bartley the trade and environment director at the Brussels Belgium-headquartered Bureau of International Recycling told CNBC. ""Even in industrialized countries manual sorting may be necessary and that can be complemented and maybe replaced by automated sorting systems using suitable technologies."" Automated sorting happens with magnets flotation wind sifters (to separate light and heavy materials) and cameras among other techniques according to Bartley and such equipment can be bought off the shelf and integrated into recycling plants. But key questions include how much the separation equipment costs the all-in running costs per tonne of processed materials and what is the added value to each of the separated streams of materials. In other words: ""When is it profitable?"" Bartley said. Matanya Horowitz the founder and CEO of AMP Robotics which ranked No. 25 on this year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list got his big recycling idea after visiting a materials recovery facility (MRF) — the destination for residential and commercial recyclables — and learned not only how demanding work conditions are but how inefficient the process can be.

Horowitz was looking for applications of robotics technology that could be improved. He got his doctorate at California Institute of Technology and when he was there he worked on several Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) challenges. ""That helped me understand what was working well in robotics and what remained a challenge"" he told CNBC. It was clear to Horowitz that computer vision could improve the work of sorting garbage for recycling. In July 2014 Horowitz launched AMP Robotics and has raised $77.8 million and has almost 130 employees. In April 2020 AMP Robotics announced it had processed more than one billion recyclable objects in a year. A primary challenge for AMP Robotics is that sorting garbage is endlessly complex. ""Recycling is a tough business to be in"" Horowitz says. ""You can't control the materials you're processing and there are all kinds of odd contaminants that people put in their recycling bins. The result is that you have to build exceptionally tough and high-performance pieces of equipment.""

He's aware of the historic insufficiencies of recycling. ""These materials (plastics metals paper) all have true value. The problem is that the cost of sorting erodes away that value"" Horowitz says. ""If you reduce the cost of sorting the margin you can extract on all those materials increases and you naturally find an incentive to capture that material. That's precisely what our technology does and how we go about our mission of enabling a world without waste."" Horowitz is optimistic. ""A quote I've always liked is 'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic'"" he said. Consumer brands can help increase the success of the recycling supply chain too according to Steve Alexander the president and CEO of the Association of Plastic Recyclers by designing packaging that can be recycled. A label on a soda bottle that has a lot of adhesive or ink may not be consistent with other recyclable designs in the soda bottle category and might in the fact contaminate that stream. ""Even though it's been separated as a soda bottle or water bottle it still could contaminate"" Alexander tells CNBC. ""It all comes down to design. The first thing we have to do is ensure the products we buy be compatible with recycling."" Brands are being pushed to be better and more transparent about their package recyclability by consumer demand. ""It's on the goodwill right now of the consumer brand company"" Alexander says but there's interest in governmental regulation mandating consumer brand package design.

Making single-use compostable packaging

Troy Swope the CEO of Footprint a technology company focused on eliminating single-use plastics through development and manufacturing of compostable containers says to focus on improving recycling for plastics is chasing the wrong solution. ""Just to be real clear: Recycling is a joke when it comes to plastic"" Swope said. ""It's one of the biggest lies we've ever been told."" Swope pointed to CarbonLite Holdings a large plastic bottle recycler that filed for bankruptcy protection in March. ""Without value no matter what we do to infrastructure... if nobody wants it at the end nature can't digest it it doesn't mean anything. It has no value"" he said.

Just to be real clear: Recycling is a joke when it comes to plastic.

Arizona-headquartered Footprint which ranked No. 45 on this year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list is focused on making compostable single-use products from cellulose plant-based materials such as a recycled cardboard box wood fibers and agricultural waste. The goal is for all products to be biodegradable or compostable in 90 days or less. And they're doing so at scale. ""We're going to deliver close to a billion units this year probably just under a billion units from three factories"" Swope told CNBC. Current Footprint customers include McDonalds SweetGreen and Conagra Brands. ""Next year we will sell billions of units"" Swope said. Footprint has three factories currently one in Arizona another in South Carolina and a third in Mexico. It is in the process of building a research center in the Netherlands and a manufacturing facility in Poland.

Questioning the environmental impact

""I think recycling and I say this as a recycling company is not the answer to garbage"" said Tom Szaky CEO of recycling company Terracycle and zero-waste packaging company Loop in a recent CNBC Evolve livestream event. ""It's an answer to the symptom of garbage maybe the best way to manage waste but I think we have to go much deeper and enable an economy where garbage doesn't exist."" Indeed that's a plug for Szaky's company Loop which has consumer brands partners collaborate to make ""reusability ideally as disposability."" But it also gets at a nuance of the garbage problem which David Allaway a senior policy analyst at the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality Materials Management Program in Portland Oregon covered in a report questioning the environmental impact of recycling. ""In this country most of the impacts of consumer goods and single-use items and packaging – whether it be in toxics climate change water depletion habitat disruption or other impacts – is not a result of disposal. Rather it is a consequence of supply chains manufacturing and production"" Allaway tells CNBC. ""And as our research showed items that are 'recyclable' and 'compostable' are not necessarily better for the environment or result in lower human health impacts than functionally equivalent items that are not 'recyclable' or 'compostable.'"" That is not to say that recyclability and composability are necessarily unhelpful. Items with these popular attributes could be less impactful and some of them are less impactful but recyclability and composability are inconsistent predictors of environmental goodness according to his work which summarized roughly 17 years of international research on the topic. For example elemental mercury is very recyclable but a bad neurotoxin and whale blubber is compostable but still not a raw material that is desirable. ""Simply knowing that an item is 'recyclable' or 'compostable' tells us surprisingly little about the actual impacts on human health and the environment or the trade-offs between different materials"" Allaway said. There also are downstream effects of waste decomposition. ""Biodegradable is a great solution in countries that lack solid waste management infrastructure but in this country where most of our non-recovered waste goes to landfill biodegradable means that the material will decompose and produce methane which is a powerful greenhouse gas"" Allaway said. He cautions that promoting these popular attributes such as ""recyclable"" and ""compostable"" is a common marketing strategy that plays to popular wisdom ""which is always popular but not always wise."" What's most important in his view is that producers quantify the total environmental impact of a good with a life cycle assessment. Otherwise Allaway says society has no way of knowing whether any of these efforts are steering us in the direction of actual sustainability or just ""feel-good"" shifts in pollution involving visible obvious forms such as plastic in the oceans.

A retired shrimper and headstrong environmental activist Wilson 72 was flanked by a pair of fellow septuagenarians who unfurled a banner that read “Kill a bay. Kill the fisherman. Kill a Community.”

It didn’t take long for the police to arrive.

Wilson and company were protesting an Army Corps’ project authorized by Congress in December to dredge the Matagorda Ship Channel midway between Galveston and Corpus Christi so that Suezmax ships—also known as VLCCs short for Very Large Crude Carrier—could export oil from Texas via Port Calhoun a sleepy provincial terminal slated for $1 billion in improvements.

Environmentalists say it is unconscionable for Congress and the Army Corps to be backing Houston-based Max Midstream’s oil export plans when climate change is threatening the planet and the Biden administration has proposed reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030.

A 2020 report by Greenpeace and Oil Change International estimates that U.S. oil exports have increased by 750 percent since the export ban was lifted in 2015 peaking at approximately 3.4 million barrels per day in 2019. As of October 2019 24 percent of all crude extracted in the United States was exported.

But that is only half the outrage for Wilson and the “fisher folk” of Calhoun County mostly Vietnamese Hispanic and working-class white shrimpers oystermen and crabbers. The dredging would also roil mercury-laced sediment in one of the nation’s largest most beautiful and toxic Superfund sites Lavaca Bay poisoned by a now-idled Alcoa aluminum refinery that spewed an estimated 1.2 million pounds of mercury into its azure waters from 1966 to 1979.

“I’ve been a long-time shrimper. I know exactly what dredging material does” Wilson said. “Once I had a set of crab traps not too far from a small-scale dredging operation. And it killed every single crab and fish there. And here we’re talking about dredging material contaminated with mercury and methylmercury from Alcoa refinery.”

Ethan Buckner manager of the nonprofit Earth Works’ Infrastructure and Petrochemicals Campaign said the dredging project “has come in and essentially glossed over the tremendous dangers posed by dredging through a mercury-contaminated Superfund site. It’s really disturbing how quickly this project is advancing.”

But why it is advancing at all he said is impossible to fathom. “The U.S. shouldn’t be exporting crude. It’s contradictory to the administration’s commitment to tackle environmental racism and climate change to essentially sacrifice the health and well-being of Gulf Coast communities” he said.

‘It’s Personal for Me’

The Calhoun Port Authority took the lead in steering what is officially titled the Matagorda Ship Channel Improvement Project (MSCIP) for over a decade. The project includes carving out a new 1200-foot turning basin in Lavaca Bay and widening the entrance to the channel by 13000 feet in addition to deepening the entrance and bay-side channels by 9 feet. The bottom widths will also be extended—by 100 feet in the bay channel and 250 feet in the entrance channel.

This deepening and widening of the bay channel and the offshore channel is meant to allow Suezmax or Aframax-class ships to access the port. An estimated 21 million cubic yards of sediment will be dredged in the process which will need relocation and reutilization. The project is currently in the pre-construction design and engineering phase following the Congressional authorization.

The port authority’s partner Max Midstream views the port as a midway option between Houston and Corpus Christi with light ship traffic and plans to develop it as a major export hub focused on crude shipments to Europe. It boasts “a firm partnership with the Port of Calhoun” and has pledged $360 million for dredging and widening the Matagorda Ship Channel as part of the agreement.

Max Midstream did not respond to a request for comment.

Wilson worries about Lavaca Bay and all the dredging that will be required in the Superfund site. “Main point is that the process of dredging will resuspend mercury-contaminated sediments and will smother 700 acres of oysters reefs which is the only source of living for the local fishing communities” she said.

The dredging would also bring more salt water into the bay and threaten the reefs through increased salinity she said. “So it was those three things about the dredging: the mercury the burying of oyster reefs in mud and the salinity rushing in.”

Thirty five days before she towed her boat to Galveston for the protest outside the Army Corps’ offices Wilson began a hunger strike in her quest to stop the dredging. She would leave her house around 8:30 am drive her 1995 red Chevy to the Lavaca Bay waterfront set up folding chairs and unfurl her hand-painted banners screaming “STOP THE DREDGING” and “STOP OIL EXPORT.”

From her perch she could see the abandoned Alcoa aluminum plant rusting away and next to it Formosa Plastics Corp.’s industrial estate. Wilson won a $50 million settlement against Formosa in October 2019 for dumping thousands of plastic pellets in Lavaca Bay and nearby waterways. It’s the largest settlement in U.S. history involving a citizen complaint against an industrial polluter under the Clean Water Act.

Of the $50 million Formosa settlement to be paid out over five years $20 million was earmarked for creating a cooperative to develop sustainable fishing shrimping and oyster harvesting and revitalize depleted marine ecosystems that had been hit by years of contamination.

“We have worked for the last one year setting up a fisheries cooperative to help the local fishing communities” Wilson said. “Dredging will ruin our year-long effort to revive the local fishing industry. So it’s personal for me.”

The commercial fishing industry in Lavaca Bay once thriving has struggled to make a comeback after the devastation of mercury contamination from the Alcoa superfund site and later the plastics pollution from Formosa.

José Martinez 65 said he has been shrimping in Lavaca and Matagorda Bays since 1984 when he settled in Wilson’s hometown of Seadrift Texas with his wife and three kids. Originally from Mexico Martinez said Port Lavaca was full of shrimp and oysters back then.

“But there’s been fewer catches every year since the last 10 years because of the chemicals Formosa released in bay waters” he said. “Now we have to go to the ship channel to catch the shrimp in deep waters because there’s very little left elsewhere.”

Martinez said there are about 200 families of fisher folk in Seadrift Port O’ Connor and Port Lavaca who depend on oysters and shrimp for their livelihood. “We sell our catch to the local buyers who don’t pay enough and whatever is left from the day’s netting we sell it on the roadside because we cannot store it” he said.

Having to provide for an extended family with 10 grandchildren Martinez said he is concerned about the dredging of the Matagorda Ship Channel.

“It’s not going to be good for our business because they are going to cover the reefs with mud and I don’t think it’s a good idea” he said. “When they start digging it will bring out the mercury which is not going to be good for the fish and shrimp. Everyone’s got a family and it’s going to affect a lot of people.”

Pausing for words Martinez said he didn’t know what it would take to put a stop to the project. “It’s a big company with a lot of money” he said. “And we don’t have such money.”

‘Working As Fast As We Can’

Since 2019 Max Midstream energy company has moved aggressively to acquire terminal and pipeline assets to connect the Port of Calhoun to the Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin—Texas’ two major shale oil fields. New pipelines are projected to transport up to 20 million barrels a month to the revitalized terminal at the port.

Last October in announcing a public-private partnership with Max Midstream Charles Hausmann Calhoun Port Authority director said the company would invest $360 million in port infrastructure improvements including $225 million for the Matagorda Ship Channel Improvement Project. Overall Max Midstream plans to invest $1 billion in upgrading Port of Calhoun to accommodate the volume of future crude oil exports. Completion of the first phase of the project was slated for late 2020 and the second phase should be done by 2023.

The Calhoun Port Authority did not respond to a request for comment.

In March Coraggio Maglio chief of hydraulics and hydrology for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Galveston District said at a public hearing that the dredging project was on a fast track. “Typically when we go through an effort like this we have a year year and a half or two years to do what we’re doing” he said. “We’re condensing it down to four to five months so we’re tightening our timelines and working as fast as we can.”

The community members in attendance were concerned especially about the environmental impact of the mercury-tainted materials that would be dredged up and the new unconfined open-water placement sites the Corps proposed for the disposal of the dredged sediment.

Dr. Paul Bunnell president of the local nonprofit Lavaca Bay Foundation said he was disappointed when the corps officials said they wanted to work with the community but were not interested in hearing anything that would require redesigning the project because they are under tight deadlines.

The foundation’s chairman Jim Blackburn an environmentalist and Rice University professor requested in an April 15 letter to the Army Corps that a Supplementary Environmental Impact Statement be conducted to analyze changes the corps has made to its initial 2009 dredging plan and modifications done in the last two years.

Blackburn said in the letter that mercury contaminants in Lavaca and Matagorda Bay will be picked up and redistributed by the dredging and the changed disposal locations and design will lead to more sediment distributed along the western shoreline of Matagorda bay. The impact on oyster reefs and seagrass beds will be much greater he said and the effects of more mercury entering the bay ecosystem and into the food chain through fish and humans must be re-evaluated.

On April 20 the Lavaca Bay Foundation and Matagorda Bay Foundation jointly sent a 17-page letter to the Army Corps saying the current “least cost” plan which proposes moving dredged material to unconfined open bay areas west of the ship channel is a “dramatic departure” from the containment sites identified in 2009 environmental impact statement. The foundations contend these changes are significant and under the National Environmental Policy Act and Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) rules necessitate a new assessment.

Among the myriad concerns raised in the letter is dissatisfaction with the proposed mitigation plans. The foundations argue that increased salinity and sediment transport alone will result in significantly more oyster deaths and habitat losses than the Corps acknowledges.

In all the foundations highlighted 12 points that illustrate what they describe as adverse impacts on natural habitat local communities and associated commercial activities. The corps has yet to respond.

In 2018 and 2019 the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service independently concluded that existing studies did not adequately assess the project’s impact on natural resources and habitat.

The agencies also raised concerns about legacy mercury contamination spreading throughout the bay as a result of dredging adding that the selection of new open sites for dredge material disposal are in stark contrast to the original 2009 plan. A third party review led by a panel of experts in 2018 echoed similar concerns at length.

Lynda Yezzi the Army Corps’ public affairs chief in Galveston said the dredging “is a congressionally authorized project.” She also provided a federal register notice showing the corps did seek public comments as did the Calhoun Port Authority she said.

‘I Got a New Mugshot’

Buckner manager of Earth Works’ Infrastructure and Petrochemicals Campaign said the plan to expand the Port of Calhoun and dredge Lavaca Bay is the result of lifting the ban on crude oil exports in 2015 which has triggered tremendous competition among oil and gas companies to build export facilities.

Buckner said there are at least nine proposed crude export facilities along the Gulf of Mexico some of which could move up to 2 million barrels per day.

Echoing these concerns over 80 community groups and environmental organizations sent a letter to President Biden in April asking the administration to revoke the project’s authorization and reinstate the crude export ban. Arguing that the project is being unduly rushed and merits re-evaluation the letter said projects like the Max Midstream export terminal would expand and perpetuate fossil fuel dependence for decades to come.

Buckner said the community in Calhoun County would essentially be suffering from additional pollution from toxics in order to allow Max Midstream to export climate-polluting products to other countries.

Wilson lying in the coffin while blocking the entrance to the Army Corps’ offices in Galveston was indeed quickly arrested and led away just as she’d anticipated. As that was taking place the Calhoun Port Authority and Max Midstream announced the first successful loading of crude at the Port of Calhoun Terminal which left them a step closer to shipping Texas oil to European markets.

The following morning Wilson was spirited but audibly weak after the night in jail. (She ended her hunger strike that day). “Look I got a new mugshot” she said. “I’m on to a new resistance now. You will soon see what we’re going to do next. They’re not going to take the Bay from me.”

The local agents of the doomed MV X-Press Pearl this week refused to comment on Government claims that vital information about a nitric acid leak from an on-board container had been withheld from Sri Lankan authorities for at least ten hours after the vessel reached anchorage outside the Colombo Port.

A senior official from Sea Consortium Lanka (Pvt) Ltd said all matters related to the disaster will be handled by a team of lawyers based in Sri Lanka and Singapore. On Friday State Minister of Coast Conservation Nalaka Godahewa said the vessel had called at two ports–in Qatar and India–before heading towards Colombo for a scheduled stop.

Late notification

It was found out much later by Sri Lankan authorities that the ship had requested at each destination to shift a container of nitric acid as it was leaking. Both turned it down citing inadequate facilities. X-Press Pearl reached Sri Lankan waters around midnight on May 19. But it did not inform the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) or the Colombo Port control room of the leak Dr Godahewa said.

The first indication came via email at around 10a.m.–ten hours later–requesting permission to rearrange this container when they berth at Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT) around midnight on May 20. There was no indication of an emergency.

And it was at 12 noon that day (official data shows it was at 12.40p.m.) more than twelve hours later that the crew notified the SLPA of a fire before saying it had been successfully managed onboard. At 2p.m. the vessel asked for help.

Despite this omission Minister Godahewa was evasive when asked why immediate action had not been taken against the local agents or any other party. He said there must be an investigation first and that it could not be done when “even the fire wasn’t out yet”.

Harbour Master K. M. Nirmal P. Silva meanwhile pointed out that the vessel had declared the presence of dangerous cargo but not the leak. He also said it could not be determined whether the fire was triggered by the leak or some other factor. The ship had gone to the two other ports with the same condition and not faced a problem he added. It was not immediately clear why he attempted to distance the leak from the disaster that followed.

MV X-Press Pearl was a Singapore-flagged container cargo ship and only three months old. It has 322 tons of bunker fuel in tanks and the worst environmental damage will occur if what’s left of the ship breaks apart or it sinks emptying the oil into the sea. Authorities have said they are on alert for this.

Debris spreads far and wide

The ship contained 1486 containers with 25 tons of nitric acid caustic soda solid sodium methoxide solution cosmetics methanol and vinyl acetate etc. It had 25 crew members on board. Official reports state they had released its carbon dioxide flooding system to extinguish the fire but it was not successful.

By yesterday debris from the burning vessel along with contents of containers washed up along the coastline from Marawila (Puttalam district) to Maggona (Kalutara district) said A Navaratnerajah Chairman of the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA). This means remains were scattered on the beaches of four districts in two provinces.

Oceanswell a marine conservation research and education organization founded by marine biologist Asha de Vos published a dispersion model prepared by Charitha Pattiaratchi and Sarath Wijeratne oceanographers at the University of Western Australia to see where debris and oil will travel between May 25 and 27.

“In a nutshell the currents are shifting southward and we can expect to see more accumulation of debris towards Colombo and the South” it said. “Oil will likely get washed up north of Colombo.”

Meanwhile dead marine animals including turtles have started appearing. They are likely to have succumbed to exposure to toxic chemicals from the ship.

The coastline from Dickowita to Kochchikade is severely polluted by debris Dharshani Lahandapura Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) Chairperson told the Sunday Times. Cleanup was already going on in 21 beaches.

There was serious concern about the impact on marine life Prof. Navaratnerajah said: “We continue to collect samples but it will take time to determine the full extent of damage to beaches and marine life or how long it will take for things to return to normal.”

The toxic chemicals and cosmetics could have a severe negative effect on the marine food chain said Deeptha Amarathunga Senior Scientist at NARA leading the expert team studying the environmental impact.

Chemicals mixed with seawater will cause reactions that could alter the pH level of the seawater in the immediate vicinity Dr Amarathunga said. “While larger fish might be able to escape smaller fish and organisms such as phytoplankton which provide food for a wide range of smaller sea creatures will die” he warned. “This in turn will negatively impact the marine food chain needed to sustain a balanced ecosystem.”

Meanwhile the micro-plastics seen in the form of tiny pebbles among the debris too will harm marine life “We will not be able to remove all of them and they will be in the environment for a very long time” he noted.

“We have collected water and sediment samples up to Lunawa as of Saturday and will continue to collect samples for testing from other areas where we hear debris has washed ashore” he said. “We will also routinely collect samples from affected areas over a month or so and test them continuously to gauge the impact.” Since fishing in affected areas is prohibited Dr Amarathunga said the public need not fear eating fish.

Much of the blaze was doused by Friday but the fire escalated on a part of the ship again that night. It could have been to one of its fuel tanks igniting said Ms Lahandapura. It is not certain how much oil was burned up and how much is left. To assess this the fire must be completely out and the ship cooled.

Fishermen hit

Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa led some ministers and senior officials to Uswetakeiyawa in Wattala for an inspection. On his instructions the Government yesterday announced that the Rs 5000 allowance granted to those who lost livelihoods owing to movement restrictions will be extended to fishermen affected by the latest disaster.

All day-fishing activities from Panadura to Negombo were banned over fears that fish in these regions were contaminated by chemicals or plastic pellets from the ship. Fishing in the Negombo lagoon is also suspended.

The disaster occurred around 9.5 nautical miles (17.5 km) off the Colombo Port. At a press conference the Government rejected reports it had allowed the ship into Sri Lankan waters despite knowing of a risk.

Firefighting efforts were hampered by adverse weather. The harbour master said it was the worst weather he had seen during his 17 years on the job. The crew were evacuated and quarantined. Two were admitted to hospital for injuries while another tested positive for COVID-19.

Several explosions onboard reignited fires that were doused while some containers fell into the sea and sank. The containers predominantly contained chemicals making it more difficult to control the flames.

There was no ban on multi-day fishing trawlers operating in deep seas. Fishermen in parts of the country were also encouraged to continue their work.

Meanwhile the public are urged not to fear eating fish. “There is a misconception that it is unsafe to eat fish but those sold recently and currently on sale were caught prior to the incident” said Kanchana Wijesekera State Fisheries Minister. “We have already suspended all fishing activities along the affected stretch of coast. The restrictions will remain until agencies like MEPA and the Coast Conservation Department (CCD) tell us it’s safe to recommence.”

Minister Wijesekera said the fishing ban will hit a large number of fishermen who carry out day-fishing in the Negombo lagoon and Gampaha and Colombo districts. About 5600 day-fishing vessels are affected.

The Fisheries Department has identified some 28 professions directly connected to the fisheries sector in these areas. They include producers and sellers of dried fish transporters and fish vendors. The Minister said the Government hopes to provide financial relief in lieu of lost wages. It has been discussed with the District Secretaries of Colombo and Gampaha as well. Details of affected persons are being collected.

Fishermen in the Wattala Pamunugama area didn’t go out to sea for nearly two weeks–first owing to inclement weather and then the ship disaster said Lal Nissanka President of the United Rural Fishermens’ Society.

“All of us are engaged in day-fishing activities” he pointed out. “This is the best season for prawns but we have not been able to reap that harvest. There are over 1400 fishermen in our society who have not been able to go out to sea. This has had a devastating financial impact on us.”

Investigations and claims

MEPA’s Deputy Director-General Jagath Gunasekara lodged a complaint with the Colombo Harbour Police on May 23 in respect of the marine pollution Police Spokesman Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police Ajith Rohana said.

The harbour police have started investigations and reported facts to the Colombo Magistrate’s Court. On judicial orders samples taken from the sea and debris were sent to the Government Analyst.

Ship workers including the captain are still under quarantine therefore police were unable to record statements. However police will contact the local agent and further action will be taken DIG Rohana said.

Investigations are continuing also to arrest those who collected debris from the vessel on the Negombo beach while ignoring warnings from authorities that they could contain dangerous chemicals. Eight suspects have been taken in while a lorry allegedly used to transport these goods was also confiscated.

Separately MEPA will lodge an interim claim with the X-Press Pearl’s owners for compensation for damage caused to the marine environment Ms Lahandapura said. This is because it could take months to accurately calculate the full extent of losses as it was a complicated process.

A similar process was followed when the container vessel MT Blue Diamond caught fire off the Eastern coast of Sri Lanka in September last year. Various Government agencies incurred Rs 442 million in cost while investigations proved the actions of the ship’s captain had also contributed towards the incident. Legal action was instituted against him in the Colombo Magistrate’s Court leading to a guilty plea and a fine of Rs 12mn. The vessel was allowed to leave once the total payment was deposited with the Finance Ministry.

But it took around four months to assess the damage caused by an oil slick from the ship Ms Lahandapura said. It was only a few weeks ago that the Attorney General forwarded MEPA’s assessment to the local insurer of the shipping company. “The insurer has informed us that they need time to study our report and we are hopeful of a positive response from them” she reported.

The cleanup

More than 1000 persons mainly military were toiling since Wednesday to clean up debris. Booms were laid at the entrance to the Negombo lagoon to protect marine life in case of an oil spill MEPA General Manager Terney Pradeep Kumara told the Sunday Times.

The biggest concern continues to be the possibility of hundreds of tons of thick bunker oil leaking into the sea. That would compound an already bad disaster. There is currently no danger of the ship breaking and releasing the fuel Navy Commander Vice Admiral Nishantha Ulugetenne told media on Friday.

The Dutch salvage company hired by the shipowners had sent a 12-person team of firefighting experts to Sri Lanka to assist in the operation. “Their equipment arrived the following day” the Commander said. “Unfortunately the weather on both days was severe with wind speeds reaching from 45 to 60 knots at times. This resulted in the fire spreading quickly throughout the vessel.”

The fire has now been controlled considerably with only the aft portion of the vessel still in flames. There is still smoke coming from other parts of the vessel and flames are sporadically visible as wind speed picks up. The Navy was working together with the salvors to put these out.

Sri Lankan authorities requested Indian assistance on May 25 as Indian Coast Guard (ICG) vessels are equipped to prevent any oil spill from spreading the Vice Admiral stressed. “While there is no danger at present of the ship breaking up we can’t say whether how much of the oil on board the vessel has been exhausted and how much still remains” he said.

The Indian High Commission noted in a media release on Friday that ICG Ships Vajira Vaibhav and a Coast Guard Dornier aircraft were currently part of the joint operation. Samudra Prahari a specialized pollution response vessel arrived in the area yesterday to augment pollution control efforts.

The operation’s focus has been on preventing the spread of fire towards the vessel’s bow thereby protecting anchor cable chain and associated machinery in highly inclement weather the release added. There was heavy smoke only near the accommodation/superstructure area in aft portion of the ship. This was being tackled.

“Overall the MV X-Press Pearl is currently assessed as being stable and not having issues with watertight integrity” the release said.

Waste water released in Nag river is the biggest reason for the pollution. The Pollution Abatement project is announced by the government to treat the black and brown waters of the river.

By Kaushik Bhattacharya :

Estimated project cost increased by a whopping 16 times in last 10 years

DREAMS do not always sail through the waters of time. In case of the city’s signature Nag river the dreams of rejuvenation abatement of pollution and river-front development have remained only on paper despite passage of 10 years. However the estimated cost of the project has undergone several revisions. In fact the estimated cost of the project has increased by a whopping 16 times during the said period. Civic authorities and Mayors of the city over the years have been speaking of rejuvenation of the Nag river. Nitin Gadkari Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways also has been championing the cause of river rejuvenation. His grand plan for city’s development envisioned ‘water taxi’ running in Nag river and citizens using it as their daily commute. Sadly the ‘nullah’ that remains in the form of Nag river has taken toll of the grand vision.

What else can explain the project remaining only on paper for 10 years with only cost getting revised? Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had prepared a detailed project report of the Nag river rejuvenation plan and submitted it to the State Government for approval under the Centre’s National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) in 2008. Then the estimated project cost was Rs 241.10 crore. The State asked for a revision of plan and sought details accordingly. NMC then submitted a revised plan entailing the cost of Rs 126.30 crore in 2012. Maharashtra Government approved the plan and sent it to the Union Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC). Meera Mehrishi Additional Secretary of MoEF&CC reviewed the plan on April 14 the same year and assured that the plan would be approved. In the year 2014 a team of experts from IIT Roorkee inspected the river and submitted its report to MoEF&CC. The project got a positive nod after that and a revised proposal of Rs 1252.32 crore was sanctioned. Gadkari directed the officials concerned to present a fresh proposal in the year 2018. In January 2021 Gadkari again took initiative and arranged a meeting of the ministry concerned in New Delhi. After the meeting Gadkari announced in a media conference that the cost of Nag River Rejuvenation and Pollution Abatement Project was increased and Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA) approved loan of Rs 1700 crore for the project. Gadkari also stated that the State Cabinet had cleared the project about a year ago but it was stuck in Ministry of Jal Shakti. In the same press conference he also stated that Union Finance Ministry had prohibited ministries from sanctioning new projects but he obtained permission for Nag river project.

On March 2 Gadkari made another announcement of approval of Rs 2117.54 crore for Nag River Pollution Abatement Project after a meeting with World Bank officials Directorate General of National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) and Municipal Commissioner of Nagpur. However all through these years the vision did not translate into concrete action on ground except for usual pre-monsoon cleaning of Nag river. Today Nag river has been reduced to a highly polluted water channel of sewage and industrial waste. NMC’s detailed project report on ‘Rejuvenation of Nag River and its Tributaries in Nagpur city’ stated that city generated 345.40 Million Liter per Day (MLD) sewage water in 2011. Now in 2021 the city is producing 550-600 MLD waste water. By 2041 this will cross 750 MLD mark. All this waste water directly flows through Nag and Pili rivers and has become the biggest contributing factor to polluting these rivers. The facts and figures available should make the authorities first work on changing the ground reality instead of making grandiose plans.

NMC still waiting for project approvals from Centre THOUGH the minister announced the project for Nag river NMC is still waiting for permission from Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC) in New Delhi. NMC’s special officer on duty for rivers and lakes Mohammed Israil told ‘The Hitavada’ that the pandemic delayed the EFC meeting which was likely to be held in July. “We have received the State Cabinet’s permission for the project but the EFC’s nod is required for implementation of the project” said Israil. The officer further said “National River Conservation Directorate (NRCD) which is going to implement the project has yet to appoint the Project Management Consultant (PMC). After the appointment of PMC the tender process will take shape at civic administration level.” Israil stated that the Loan Agreement with JICA had already been done and the remaining formalities would be over soon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZW9ubGluZW5nLmNvbS8xMC1jb21wYW5pZXMtc2h1dC1kb3duLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtaW4tbmlnZXJpYXMtZm9vZC1iZXZlcmFnZXMtaW5kdXN0cnktaW4tZml2ZS15ZWFycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 companies shut down business in Nigeria's food beverages industry in five years,"Between 2015 and now 10 companies in the food beverage and tobacco industry have shut their operations and businesses in Nigeria due to the harsh working environment particularly government policies stifling the nation’s economy and the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The President Food Beverage and Tobacco Senior Staff Association (FOBTOB) Comrade Quadri Olaleye who decried the negative effects of government policies and COVID-19 in the sector also said the sector had suffered from mass sack of workers and several factory closures within the last five years.

Olaleye was speaking at the 14th National Delegates’ Conference (NDC) of the Food Beverage and Tobacco Senior Staff Association (FOBTOB) held in Abuja at the weekend.

To this end Olaleye who is also the President of Trade Union Congress (TUC) of Nigeria said FOBTOB has since deleted the names of the 10 companies from its book of operation.

“During the same period the following company was shut down and they were equally expunged from our books” Olaleye said.

The companies affected were: Bendel Brewery Limited; Danico West Africa Limited; International Breweries Limited; Pal Breweries Plc; Port Harcourt Flour Mills Limited; Scoa Foods Limited; Standard Biscuit & Agro Products Jos; UTC Foods Plc; Vitamalt Plc; Ranona Limited; and Deli Foods Limited.

He said “it is our hope that the government would wake up from the snail speed approach to governance since governance is a serious business for serious-minded people. The government must urgently start addressing the issue of the growing unemployment rate insecurity and the general infrastructural decay in our nation.”

Besides he pointed out that 24 other companies in the sector carried out mass sack of workers within the period adding “between the last Delegates’ Conference in 2015 and now our industrial sector has witnessed redundancies in the following companies that have members affiliated to our association.”

Among the 24 companies listed are: Nigeria Distilleries Limited; Nestle Nigeria Plc; Cadbury Nigeria Plc; Flour Mills of Nigeria Limited; Seven-Up Bottling Company Limited; Sosaco Nigeria Limited; Dangote Flour Mills Limited; Ragolis Waters Ltd; Guinness Nigeria Plc; International Breweries Plc; Nigerian Breweries Plc; Fan Milk Nigeria Plc; and CWAY Food and Beverage Limited among others.

According to Olaleye it is unfortunate that despite the vantage position of the industry to the economical sustenance it has not received 10 per cent of the attention giving to other sectors of the economy.

He said: “The production cost has gone up but nothing was done in terms of financial support and tax relief by the government to cushion the effects of this rather we are subjected to different bans ranging from accessibility of forex to import raw materials to forced backward integration. We are not opposed to backward integration in any form but its implementation was ill-time as it has led to massive redundancy in our industry.

The FOBTOB president added: “I on behalf of the teeming members of this association using this medium to draw the attention of the government to the food sector in particular and we request that the government meets with our Employers’ Association for engagement on how to move the food sector forward and a means of finding the lasting solution to the problematic issue of de-industrialization of the country.”

E. Williams | Black Voice News

Wells Fargo & Company has finalized investments in two African American Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs)–the Harbor Bank of Maryland and Industrial Bank of Washington D.C.

By making these last two equity capital investments the company has now invested 13 such institutions fulfilling its March 10 2020 announcement to commit $50 million to Black-owned banks in communities across the country including City First Bank in Los Angeles.

“We are a proud partner to all these banks as each serves as a cornerstone to the communities they serve” said Gigi Dixon head of External Engagement for Diverse Segments Representation and Inclusion at Wells Fargo.

Additional Program Benefits

“The way we’ve structured this program goes beyond a simple capital investment; we’ve worked to understand these MDIs their needs their strategic aspirations and their challenges. We want to help them grow so they can continue to be important drivers of economic vitality for years to come.”

As part of the investment Wells Fargo is offering access to a dedicated relationship team that can work with each MDI on financial technological and product development strategies to help each institution strengthen and grow. In addition Wells Fargo will be making its nationwide ATM network available for customers of these 13 MDIs to use without incurring fees.

“Honoring our 86+ year commitment of educating and helping our communities build generational wealth Industrial Bank is excited to partner with Wells Fargo in expanding these efforts” said B. Doyle Mitchell Jr. president and CEO of Industrial Bank. “Being one of only 20 African American banks in the country this partnership will enhance our ability to grow and create more opportunities to provide capital to those communities we support. We appreciate Wells Fargo for its commitment to invest in minority institutions and partnering to alleviate the negative impact of financial inequalities on communities of color and closing the racial wealth gap.”

The structure of Wells Fargo’s investment is in the form of critical equity capital which is foundational to the MDIs’ ability to expand lending and deposit-taking capacity in their communities. The investments primarily non-voting positions are designed to enable the banks to maintain their MDI status.

Wells Fargo is also supporting each MDI’s development through a banking relationship in the form of a single touchpoint coverage model that will help them access Wells Fargo’s expertise and pursue strategic priorities like entering new markets expanding locations designing new products and hiring staff to support loan growth.

External partners that assisted Wells Fargo include the National Bankers Association and Sullivan & Cromwell. External advisory committee members are Kim D. Saunders president and CEO of NBA; Aron Betru managing director of the Center for Financial Markets at Milken Institute; and John W. Rogers Jr. chairman co-CEO and CIO of Ariel Investments.

“The grit to see through difficult times like the 2008 financial crisis the tech crash 9/11—these were very difficult times” Altshuler said.



“Everyone can invest in a bull market but when times get tough you need to be that steady calming hand.”



If anyone who knows about financial advisers it’s Altshuler who oversees 1400 employees generating $1.6 billion in annual sales in the Wealth and Management division for Wells Fargo the nation’s third largest bank.



His Wells Fargo Advisors ranks No. 3 on the Business Journal’s annual list of financial advisers and brokerages.



He leads more than the brokerage unit as Wells Fargo recently completed a reorganization of its wealth management businesses which brings in about a fifth of Wells Fargo’s annual sales.



In March the bank named Altshuler as the Senior Managing Director of Wealth and Investment Management for the Pacific South Division.



His unit manages the wealth of more than 160000 households in the regions of Southern California Hawaii Las Vegas Arizona and New Mexico.



Besides brokerage services he also oversees a private bank that services high-net-worth individuals and families advisers in Wells Fargo branches and a channel with registered independent advisers (RIAs).



“We had separate leaderships over all of those separate channels” Altshuler said during an hour-long interview with the Business Journal at his 14th floor office in Newport Center.



“At the beginning of this year we consolidated that into one divisional leadership that would run the entire Wealth and Investment Management division.”

Surf Fan



Altshuler grew up in Santa Barbara where his mother worked at the University of California

Santa Barbara for 45 years. He was an active outdoorsman learning to surf and golf as well as play volleyball. After graduating from San Diego State University with a degree in economics he landed at Prudential Securities.



“Growing up I was really focused on athletics and coaching” he said. “I always thought my destiny was to be a coach and give people guidance and counsel. I wanted to make sure I could give back in that way.



“I realized that this job of advising families and corporations was really a lot of the same thing but it also had my interests in the financial markets. It felt like a natural fit.”



He moved to Orange County in 2000 first overhauling an office in Seal Beach for which he noted there is “great surf” nearby.



By 2005 he took over most of the Orange County market bringing in $57 million in annual revenue.



Prudential was eventually bought by Wachovia which itself was acquired by Wells Fargo following the 2008 financial crisis. Altshuler said about 60 different firms are rolled into Wells Fargo wealth unit.



“I’ve been with the same firm for 27 years; the name’s changed a few times” he quipped.

The Big Problem



About five years ago Wells Fargo ran into big problems on its banking side when it was disclosed that employees opened fake checking accounts and collected unlawful fees. The bank last year settled with the federal government agreeing to pay $3 billion in fines; previously it had accepted a $1.95 trillion limit to its assets. Altshuler said that limit doesn’t apply to the wealth unit which has about $1.8 trillion in client assets.



He said clients would ask about the scandal and generally stayed when they found out it didn’t affect their own investments he said.



“It definitely wasn’t the most fun time I’ve had in my 27-year history but it happened it was addressed and fortunately didn’t affect this side of the business.”



Still the bank decided to reorganize its financial services unit. In February it announced it would sell its Asset Management unit which includes some $603 billion in assets and 450 investment professionals to private equity firms GTCR and Reverence Capital Partners for $2.1 billion.



The deal will allow Wells Fargo to focus more on its wealth and brokerage businesses the bank said.



The move will also allow the financial services unit to avoid complaints about conflicts of interest.



“There are these conflicts that the public won’t stand for anymore” Altshuler said. “The public perception has changed. The days of manufacturing proprietary products and selling them through a distribution channel are done at least at this firm.”



Wells Fargo also works with RIAs who tout their independence of selling only advice not products.



“The independent RIA space is going to continue to expand and grow.”

The Big Change



The financial services sector has certainly changed from when Altshuler began when clients had a need for information and guidance such as how to get a 5% tax free return or the most recent earnings of IBM.



Nowadays financial plans are “a commodity that you can get for free at the discount competitors out there” he said.



“Now it’s guiding people through the changes in their lives especially as we come out of things like the pandemic and the demographics of where we are such as the amount of wealth that will transfer in the next 15 years with the baby boomers.



“You have to deliver all things holistically whether it’s philanthropic family dynamics or business successions. That’s why we’re so well positioned. It’s so much different than the business I grew up in.”



Wells Fargo he said can offer a variety of investment strategies from millennials with do-it-yourself digital offerings to wealthy families who need to manage more than $50 million. Wells Fargo’s recent reorganization has helped employees reach across different units to obtain help he said.



“What that has done is provide incredible flexibility because the hurdles and obstacles of clients obtaining some of the services that maybe the family office offered but the retail broker or the independents did not. Now all those walls and conflicts and separate P&Ls got eliminated so now it’s based on what the clients’ needs are regardless of what channel they are in.



“We’re the only firm that offers all these services with the same umbrella” he said.

The way the Sixers’ starters are playing it doesn’t matter who starts for the Wizards.

With the starters dominating the Sixers took a 3-0 lead with Saturday night’s 132-103 victory in Washington after winning the first two games at home.

The top-seeded Sixers can sweep the No. 8 Wizards on Monday night by taking Game 4 (7) in Washington. Game 5 if necessary would be Wednesday evening (time TBA) at the Wells Fargo Center.

The last time the Sixers swept a best-of-seven series was in the 1984-85 conference semifinals over the Milwaukee Bucks – Charles Barkley’s rookie season.

The difference between 3-0 and 2-1 in the postseason is massive.

Taking action:Sixers fan who dumped popcorn on Russell Westbrook has season tickets revoked

Doing it all:Sixers' Ben Simmons shows off unique skill set in playoff series against Wizards

Calming influence:Sixers Doc Rivers are relying more on experienced reserve guard George Hill in playoffs

No team in NBA history has overcome a 3-0 deficit in a best-of-seven series while 19.3 percent have advanced after being down 2-1.

While the Sixers are pleased to be in control of the matchup and on the verge of a sweep their goal involves winning 13 more games to secure an NBA championship. With home-court advantage throughout the Eastern Conference playoffs the Sixers would face the victor of the Atlanta Hawks-New York Knicks series in the second round with a spot in the conference finals on the line.

“I didn't say much after this except ‘great job’ ” said Sixers coach Doc Rivers. “We’ve done nothing.”

Having an impact:Sixers' Tobias Harris picks up the slack with Joel Embiid in foul trouble in Game 1 playoff win

High marks:Sixers make the grade(s) with Eastern Conference-best NBA regular season

For the second straight game the Wizards couldn’t stop the Sixers’ starters who combined for 100 points on 40-for-62 shooting (.645) with a staggering plus/minus of +147. The Wizards' starters were 26 for 61 (.426) with 71 points and a plus/minus of -116.

MVP finalist Joel Embiid did whatever he wanted tallying a career playoff-high 36 points on 14-for-18 shooting despite only playing 28 minutes. Tobias Harris (20 points 13 rebounds) Seth Curry (15 points 6 assists) Danny Green (15 points 5 for 9 on 3-pointers) and Ben Simmons (14 points 9 assists) excelled. Each shot at least 50 percent from the field and went a collective 13 for 22 (.591) from 3-point land.

“Danny caught fire – had a lot of great (early) looks” Simmons said. “Then Seth started getting his shots and (that helped) get Joel open. Joel caught fire and started doing his thing and Tobias started doing his thing. It’s hard to stop everybody.""

Embiid has put up 88 points in 84 minutes during the series on 31-for-46 shooting (.674) prompting Rivers to call him ""special special"" after Game 3. If you have any suggestions how to control him please pass them along to Brooks the Washington coach.

“We know who we are as a team” Curry said. “Our starting lineup has a lot of confidence playing together – we have all year long.”

In Game 2 the Sixers' starters went 34 for 50 (.680) had a +75 compared to their Washington counterparts' 25 for 54 (.463) with a -72.

“I think (our chemistry) is really good” said Harris noting the group's success begins at the defensive end. “It’s extremely balanced. ... That’s a real team playing and figuring out how to be great out there.”

Rivers admitted to being somewhat surprised at how well his starters shot the ball Saturday.

“You like some of the (starting) matchups and some of the matchups may favor them” Rivers said. “But overall I think that group is really clicking together (and) playing together. … I would never have imagined (the starters’ disparity).”

Brooks was hoping Bertans would bolster the Wizards’ 3-point shooting – Washington was 2 for 22 behind the arc Wednesday with Bertans going 0 of 4 off the bench before fouling out – and create better matchups after the bigger Sixers exploited the Wizards' undersized lineup in their first two losses.

It didn’t seem to make much of a difference as the Sixers accumulated a 14-point halftime advantage (72-58) after also being ahead by 14 (71-57) at intermission of Game 2 en route to a 25-point win.

The Wizards ended up 8 for 35 from 3-point range Saturday (Bertans was 1 for 5) compared to the Sixers’ 17-of-33 evening. In the past two outings Washington is 10 for 57 (.175) while Philadelphia is 26 of 54 (481). That's a difference of 48 points on three fewer Sixers' attempts.

Washington guard Russell Westbrook listed as questionable after injuring his right ankle in the fourth period of Game 2 contributed 26 points 12 rebounds and 10 assists. Backcourt mate Bradley Beal chipped in 25 points.

Still the confident Sixers’ starters continued to roll with Embiid insisting they can play even better. That's a scary thought.

In the short term though all that remains is to see how much rest Rivers’ team will have before beginning the second round and if the Wizards can find a way to avoid being swept.

The Nets’ TV broadcast partner YES Network captured the incident which is the fourth time in the past week that a fan at an NBA playoff game has displayed unacceptable behavior.

""It’s unfortunate that sports has come to a lot of this kind of crossroad where you’re seeing a lot of old ways come up"" Irving said. ""It’s been that way in history in terms of entertainment and performers and sports for a long period of time. It’s just underlying racism and treating people like they’re in a human zoo – throwing stuff at people saying things. There’s a certain point where it gets to be too much.”

The fan was detained by Boston Police Department officers.

“Fans have got to grow up at some point” Nets star Kevin Durant said.

Irving scored 39 points on 11-for-24 shooting including 6-for-12 on 3-pointers.

Before the best-of-seven series headed to Boston for Games 3 and 4 Irving said “Hopefully we can just keep it strictly basketball (and) there’s no belligerence or any racism going on or subtle racism (or) people yelling (expletive) from the crowd.”

Irving played for the Celtics in 2017-18 and 2018-2019 and signed with the Nets during free agency in the summer of 2019.

The Nets have a 3-1 series lead.

Durant said he knows fans are stressed from the COVID-19 pandemic but added “When you come to these games these men are human. We’re not animals. We’re not in the circus. … Have some respect for the game for the players and yourself.”

Last week fans were indefinitely banned from arenas for:

The NBA released a statement Thursday that warned an enhanced fan code of conduct ""will be vigorously enforced in order to ensure a safe and respectful environment for all involved.""

""The return of more NBA fans to our arenas has brought great excitement and energy to the start of the playoffs but it is critical that we all show respect for players officials and our fellow fans"" the NBA's statement read.

The NBA also directed fans to its Fan Code of Conduct page.

The National Basketball Players Association also released a statement

""True fans of this game honor and respect the dignity of our players"" the players’ union said. ""No true fan would seek to harm them or violate their personal space. Those who do have no place in our arenas. And their conduct is appropriately evaluated by law enforcement just as if it occurred on a public street."""

According to Variety the tweet read: ""thank u from the bottom of my [heart] for the outpouring of trailer love yesterday. the film required me to revisit areas of personal pain so seeing ppl excited & moved makes it so deeply worth it. PS to the randos being jerks about age read this great article and/or watch grease.""

Platt isn't exactly the first actor to be cast out of their age bracket. And as he said himself you have to look no further than Grease where some of the actors who played the high school students were well in their 30s.

Still it seems it is the music (and the fact that he played the part in the original musical winning a Tony and a Grammy) that may have given Platt the edge over anyone else with director Stephen Chbosky admitting he couldn't imagine anyone else playing the character.

""You just have to hear him sing the songs"" he said. ""His understanding of the character is so complete and so profound. I couldn't imagine anybody else playing it.

""It's his part. I felt very strongly about it. And to me it was never even a consideration.""

New Buyer Is Taking Preliminary Plans To Clarkstown Planners

By Tina Traster

Is it time to send that last lob at the West Rock Indoor Sports & Entertainment Complex at 21 Pralle Lane in Nanuet which over the last 12 years has been transformed from a tennis center into a multi-faceted facility pulling in more than $1 million annually in revenue?

That depends on whether a developer who is buying the complex to convert it to a self-storage facility gets greenlighted by Clarkstown’s planners and engineers who weigh in early on a project’s feasibility. The sports and entertainment center remains in operation.

The applicant Stephan Matri Jr. of 21 Pralle Owner LLC of Port Chester will appear before the Town of Clarkstown’s “Technical Advisory Committee” on Wednesday to propose the conversion of the existing structure into a self-storage facility. The West Rock complex is comprised of two large metal buildings connected by a smaller frame building in the center. The applicant wants to build a mezzanine level within the two large metal buildings – effectively adding a second level of around 70000 square feet of usable space. The applicant wants to demolish the connector building and rebuild a fully enclosed interior loading area that would service both the metal buildings’ “wings.” The project also calls for a 1000 square foot business office at the southwestern corner of the east wing.

The westerly side of the existing parking lot would be modified to provide access and turnaround for the interior loading area.

A variance is required for the floor area ratio (FAR): the maximum allowable FAR is 0.40 and the project proposes a FAR of 0.81 – twice as large.

The property is currently zoned LIO which allows for “mini-warehouses” as-of-right.

Stephan Matri Jr. is a principal at the Greenwich CT based The Renatus Group a privately held real estate investment and development company that has acquired in excess of $500mm in real estate assets. Renatus’ primary focus is the acquisition of value-add real estate consisting of income producing properties development projects and non-performing commercial real estate debt in the New York Tri-State area according to the website.

Review before TAC is intended to provide an introduction and overview of the proposed project to identify the required approvals and zoning requirements.

Over the past 12 years James Miller has transformed West Rock Indoor Sports & Entertainment Complex into a significant asset for the community. Like many challenged businesses West Rock soldiered through the pandemic by keeping its sports offerings on tap though its entertainment revenues which represent 33 percent of income were been gutted according to Miller.

In January RCBJ reported that Miller had reached out to Clarkstown town officials to tour the property to initiate discussion about what a private/public partnership could look like.

At the time of reporting the story Miller said “Our business is not for sale. We’re just having discussions about doing more together.”

Miller and town council members did agreed on one thing: the facility is unique to Rockland and the region. It has several facilities the town does not possess. It pays nearly $200000 in annual town county and school taxes and according to Clarktown town tax assessor its full market value is $4.3 million.

However there has been a proliferation in the building of self-storage facilities in Rockland and nationwide over the past several years. The facilities generate tax ratables but some argue that these passive uses do not contribute to street-level activity or vibrancy in commercial districts. Further self-storage facilities do not create many jobs or stimulate economic spinoff.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Robin Williams had The Graham Norton show in bits with a Michael Jackson joke that people might think twice about today. Watch here:

In the show which was first broadcast in November 2011 the late great actor and comedian was discussing his and Jackson's use of the same drug - in markedly different contexts.

Advert

Williams needed it for heart surgery whereas Jackson ultimately overdosed on it.

""Propofol which's nickname is Milk of Amnesia"" Williams recalled.

""Michael Jackson was taking propofol to sleep which is like doing chemotherapy because you're tired of shaving your head.""

Cue raucous laughter in the studio - the kind Williams conjured on countless occasions before his tragic suicide in 2014.

Advert

However the joke might not sit so well if made more recently.

BBC

One misjudged gag aside it's common knowledge that Williams was a special man and we were recently provided with further evidence which we frankly didn't need.

It was reported in March that the late actor would demand that any company hiring him for an event or film should also hire a specified number of homeless people.

Advert

Williams who was 63 when he passed away took the opportunity to make a difference to the lives of people around him.

According to booking agent Brian Lord Williams' rider (basically a set of demands that forms part of a performer's contract - think 'only brown M&Ms' to cite a classic example) was specific when it came to hiring homeless people.

Lord was apparently in negotiations with Williams for an event and after seeing his requirements he said: ""When I got Robin Williams' rider I was very surprised by what I found.

""He actually had a requirement that for every single event or film he did the company hiring him also had to hire a certain number of homeless people and put them to work.""

Advert

Lord continued: ""I never watched a Robin Williams movie the same way after that.

""I'm sure that on his own time and with his own money he was working with these people in need but he'd also decided to use his clout as an entertainer to make sure that production companies and event planners also learned the value of giving people a chance to work their way back.""

PA

The news was highlighted recently on a Reddit thread where one person wrote: ""He was a great man I wish there were more like him. RIP.""



Advert

Another Reddit user who claims to have worked with the actor wrote: ""I worked on a project with him (What Dreams May Come) and he got paid a ton.

""The other A-listers just clocked in and clocked out.

""He would hang around the set all day for instance taking the security guard's mother on a personal tour of the sets.

""At the end the wrap party got cancelled at the last minute due to budget crisis.

""Then suddenly it was back on.

""He attended and was the last one to leave made sure to talk to every last person.

""Then I read in the National Enquirer that he himself had paid the $50K out of pocket for the party 'on the condition of anonymity'.""

He's sorely missed that's for sure.

Back home the Taliban have intensified their war against the Afghan Army emboldened by the ongoing withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops. The fighting is brutal in the northern provinces where a woman’s loom often yields her family’s only steady cash income.

Alex Zahir production manager for the Kabul Carpet Export Center in Manhattan on Thursday May 27.

Still the merchants and humanitarians behind the Afghan Artisan Rug Popup don’t fear for the future of the beautiful carpets that are their homeland’s pride.

“It’s been one war after another for centuries” Alex Zahir explained as the first carpets for public sale were unfurled Thursday inside the Metropolitan Pavilion on W. 18th St.

“But through the wars carpets have survived” said Zahir production manager for the Kabul Carpet Export Center which runs the sale.

“They’ve been turning sheep’s wool into art for centuries” he said with a laugh. “One knot at a time.”

Zahir’s carpet company is based in the northern Balkh Province where Taliban grenade launchers and assault rifles already scar the countryside.

It’s no longer safe he said to send his workers door-to-door to collect finished carpets as they’re cut from their home looms.

“They have to sometimes put them on their donkeys or on their horses” he said of the families’ men. Man beast and carpet then travel to the nearest bus station. The precious carpets are then taken by bus to Zahir’s workshop in the city of Mazar-e-Sharif.

Sharif Hussaini U.S. Rep. for Ghadir Zada Ltd. shows off one of the Afghan Rugs from his family’s business on Thursday May 27 in Manhattan.

There the carpets are scrubbed and edged and their pile is painstakingly trimmed with knives a lengthy process known as “finishing” usually done in a city due to the need for reliable water and power. Finally the carpets are driven to Kabul’s airport or carpet bazaars.

“Kabul is the main export center for carpets” Zahir 55 now an American citizen with a carpet retail business in Knoxville Tenn. said of Afghanistan’s capital. “But I fear it may become a battleground.”

In early May the Taliban seized a district just 25 miles southwest of Kabul. But even when the Taliban ruled all of Afghanistan in the late ’90s — before they were routed in the 2001 U.S. invasion — carpets still found their way out through Pakistan.

Carpets handwoven from durable Afghan wool can last a century or longer so “there’s no ‘shelf life’ and no hurry” Zahir noted as he supervised the hanging of an 8-by-10 carpet from his company.

Each tiny tuft in its pile is a hand-tied knot. A carpet of that size contains more than a million knots he said.

“It took five six months of one family of eight adults working on it taking turns” in the northwest Province of Jawzjan he said of the carpet made from his own design.

“This is an eye looking toward a peaceful Afghanistan” he said of the large medallion at its center. “Sadly it is not happening right now and they are not hopeful.”

But Afghanistan’s history is one of women surviving through their carpets and of carpets surviving war. Creating a 10-square-foot section of rug “feeds two people for six months” Zahir estimates.

“Soviet invasion? We got the carpets out” Zahir said. “Taliban took over? We got the carpets out again” he said.

“Carpet-making will continue to feed the poorest Afghans through the next war too.”

“Through all the wars textiles are what provided for women” agreed Zolaykha Sherzad 53 a Kabul-born clothing designer who now lives in the East Village. Her label Zarif Design is popular with Afghan trendsetters; its embroidery-rich silk and cotton dressware are featured at the sale.

Sherzad and Najlla Habibyar 34 the executive director of the Kabul Carpet Export Center say that female textile entrepreneurs have made great strides in the past 20 years with the help of the U.S. and NATO.

Najlla Habibyar Executive Director The Kabul Carpet Export Center and Alex Zahir on Thursday May 27 in Manhattan.

In 2018 Habibyar’s Kabul Carpet Export Center was awarded a three-year $10 million American government grant money that subsidizes its 20 participating carpet-manufacturing companies. Together the companies employ 3900 female weavers and 2400 men who do the dying and finishing.

“All the carpets here are woven in homes — though some have tents in their yards for the looms” Habibyar explained.

“Every single piece is hand-spun hand-dyed hand-knotted wool.”

She ran her hand along a bright red carpet strewn with charming abstractions of trees and livestock.

“These tribal rugs they don’t have a pattern” she said.

“Whatever she sees out of her window — cattle the trees the chickens — she weaves.”

Through Habibyar’s group the Kabul Carpet Export Center “We have helped these women weavers have enough money so that their boys and girls can go to school instead of staying home to help make carpets” she said.

But the group’s grant from the United States Agency for International Development runs out in June. Given the uncertainties of Afghanistan’s future the agency has told Habibyar it is holding off for now on reupping.

Sherzad meanwhile worries for the future of Zarif Design’s two Kabul workshops where she said “We train 60 women each year in embroidery and seamstress work.”

“Many of them have started their own businesses. Right now my hope is for security and peace and for women not to go backward.”

Directly across from the main door to the Chelsea showroom second-generation carpet dealer Sharif Husseini unfolded a 3-by-12-foot runner that’s being offered for $995 — about the same price it would sell for if bought directly in Kabul.

Its main color is a turquoise blue so brilliant it’s hard to believe the color came from nature.

No — sheep and flowers alone are responsible explained Husseini 34 a Kabul native now living in Castro Valley Calif.

“We use wool from everywhere — Iran Iraq Pakistan. But this is the best wool Ghazni wool” he said of the durable fleece named for the frigid high-altitude province where native sheep grow particularly shaggy.

Carpets for sale at the Afghan Artisan Rug Pop-up inside the Metropolitan Pavilion on W. 18th St. in Manhattan on Thursday May 27.

“They have a tough life” he joked. “But the cold makes the wool very long and very thick and coarse so it absorbs the dye very well.”

The turquoise in the runner likely came from a mix of indigo — which comes from the leaves of a legume — and from a dye made with the bright flowers of a plant whose name he only knew in Farsi.

Husseini’s parents three sisters and five brothers still live in Afghanistan where as Shia minority Muslims they are considered infidels by the Taliban worthy of extermination. So he too worries about what will come of the troop pullout.

As Husseini continued unfolding his prized Ghazni carpets Habibyar and colleague Rob Leahy a carpet dealer from Charleston S.C. were at the showroom’s front table talking with the videographers who will set up virtual private Zoom sessions for shoppers who can’t visit in person.

The talk again turned to the Taliban and whether the Afghan Army deprived of U.S. air strike support can hold the Islamist fundamentalists off. Kandahar’s airport quickly came under rocket attack after U.S. forces abandoned their base there in recent weeks.

“Kandahar airport may now be in the hands of the Taliban but Kabul will be the last airfield to fall” Leahy predicted of the best way out for the country’s carpets.

“Their wives work on carpets right?” Habibyar suddenly asked.

It’s true Leahy agreed. Taliban wives do work on carpets.

“They all have looms in their homes” he said. Even in the regressive depths of Taliban rule no woman Shia or Sunni was barred from weaving carpets in her home helping her family and the ancient art of carpet-making survive knot by knot.

“The Taliban” Leahy said “love carpets too.”

Now a design-build team is also modernizing the interstate access that will get travelers there—through a statefunded $126-million project to build flyover ramps for a direct connection from Interstate 10 to the new terminal.

The project is about halfway complete and on schedule despite the challenges that come with building an elaborate interchange to serve an airport facility that’s already up and running.

“The opening of the new terminal presented challenges for this corridor [by creating] a significant influx of airportrelated traffic congestion at the terminal’s new access point.”

—Timothy Nickel Project Management Administrator Louisiana Dept. of Transportation and Development

The project includes constructing two elevated flyover ramps at the Loyola Drive exit of Interstate 10 in Kenner. One ramp will carry westbound traffic to the airport; the other will route traffic out of the airport and toward New Orleans. Underneath the flyover ramps will be new auxiliary lanes along I-10 between Loyola Drive and Williams Boulevard.

The project includes a diverging diamond interchange (DDI) that will allow two directions of traffic to cross each other and swap sides before getting onto the interstate. The interchange is one of the first of its kind in the state. Use of this type of interchange shaved off $60 million from the budget and eliminated the need for a third flyover ramp and a traffic signal that were part of the Louisiana Dept. of Transportation and Development’s (DOTD) original design.

“The savings are important” says J.J. Hickey project manager for lead contractor Gilchrist Construction of Alexandria La. “We want the public to feel good about the project and see that our proposal saved the taxpayers and the DOTD a substantial amount of money with the DDI.”

The old interchange to the previous terminal required westbound vehicles on I-10 to exit at Williams Boule-vard and then proceed through a series of traffic lights and turns. “It was outdated and inefficient” Hickey says.

Stantec designed the DDI which eliminates the need for a left-turn signal and is intended to cut traffic light cycles in half decrease delays and help traffic flow more smoothly.

FINDING A NEW WAY IN

Placing the terminal on the north side of the airport made it possible to construct a completely new facility from the ground up. But with the new location came a new dilemma—how to get there by car. The existing interstate connections provided access only to the original terminal on the south side of the property creating a need for new direct access points from I-10.

Initially the state did not have funding for the interchange project. So as an interim solution the airport reconfigured Loyola Drive to serve as the primary route to and from I-10 and the new terminal. But the configuration was not ideal.

“Before construction of the new airport terminal the Loyola Drive/Aberdeen Street corridor was primarily a local commuter route” DOTD project management administrator Timothy Nickel says of the two-lane roadway which is sandwiched between a predominantly residential and commercial area and swampy wetlands. “The opening of the new terminal presented challenges for this corridor [by creating] a significant influx of airport-related traffic congestion at the terminal’s new access point.”

After obtaining federal bond money for the flyover project the department gave the design-build contract the notice to proceed in August 2019—three months before the opening of the new terminal.

“They needed to get the project off the ground ASAP” Hickey says.

The need for quick action factored into DOTD’s decision to choose the design-build delivery method. “The Loyola interchange was an ideal candidate as airport access improvements would be required as soon as the airport terminal opened” Nickel says.

Plans called for the project to be designed built and completed in 1180 calendar days with a $20000 penalty for every day that goes beyond that. To streamline the process construction of temporary access roads began immediately while the design for other portions of the project were underway Nickel says.

ADDED RESPONSIBILITIES

The project’s large scope along with the condensed timelines for design and construction called for extensive planning and problem-solving by the design team.

“Traffic congestion and proximity to residential homes and commercial buildings provide challenges for maintaining traffic while constructing the project” Nickel says. “The design-build team accelerated survey collection early in the project at times providing 11 survey crews in the field to ensure accelerated data collection and to reduce project schedule impacts.”

Right-of-way considerations presented another issue as early assessments identified 20 property parcels that would require acquisition with some properties needing to be demolished.

“The state has eminent domain. But you have to be fair with property owners” Hickey says. “They have rights and we have to respect those rights and make sure we’re acting responsibly.”

The design-build team was responsible for most of the acquisitions while the DOTD acquired a hotel that needed to be demolished in the southeast quadrant of the interchange.

Gilchrist and Stantec were also charged with completing the interchange modification report (IMR) a submittal required by the Federal Highway Administration that must be completed and approved by the FHWA before any modifications to a federal highway can take place. Because the project needed to get start-ed right away the document was not complete when the DOTD obtained funding for the project.

Hickey says the interchange is one of the first designbuild projects in the state to not have IMR documents already in place. And juggling the report with project design and right-of-way acquisitions made scheduling especially difficult. “You’re building a schedule based on a lot of assumptions and projections as opposed to building a schedule that’s based on a complete set of plans where all of the critical documents and submittals are already approved before you start work” he says.

RAMP DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

The addition of the two flyover ramps was the most noticeable change to the I-10 corridor near the airport. The ramps consist of curved twin steel trapezoidal box girders which account for 2800 ft of the total ramp length and about 9 million lb of structural steel. While not commonly used in Louisiana the team chose these tub-shaped girders for the flyover structures because of their long curved spans Hickey says.

During the design phase there were several constraints that had to be considered including fabrication transportation erection and final construction. “Existing utilities and the crossing of I-10 played a major role in determining span lengths for the steel girder spans” says Brian Johnson Stantec principal.

Footing placement had to be done in a way that would minimize utility relocations and traffic interruptions. Because the interchange is in a congested area the piers had to fit where space allowed Hickey says.

“We couldn’t just design these bridge spans for whatever length we wanted them to be” he says. “The tubs allowed us to meet those lengths with the curved sections. And it was really the best solution.”

The steel tub girders required an especially long lead time because they were fabricated in Tampa. Hickey says the team set the wheels in motion to get the tubs approved fabricated and shipped a year before placing the first girder.

The ramps also include LU-48 prestressed concrete girders LG-36 prestressed concrete girders and concrete slab spans. “The concrete U girders are very similar in shape so it’s a pleasing transition” Hickey says.

Erecting the girders had to take place during nighttime hours especially over I-10 and traffic operations during girder erection were modified to accommodate traffic while the lifts were taking place over I-10 Johnson says.

Collaboration meetings with the designer contractor steel fabricator and erector helped determine the appropriate lengths for the girder field pieces. “Allowing each party to provide input at initial design helped increase efficiency in the different phases of design and construction” Johnson says. “The erector provided guidance on a maximum field piece length of 120 ft while the fabricator gave insight on plate sizes and assembly practices.”

“We couldn’t just design these bridge spans for whatever length we wanted them to be.”

For portions of roadway where settlement was a concern the project team placed additional embankments to compress the soils underneath. They also placed wick drains to create drainage paths and lessen water pressure allowing the soft soils to compress quicker and expedite the settlement process. This would ultimately provide a smoother roadway with less maintenance issues in the future Nickel says.

The team selected prestressed concrete piles for the bridge’s deep foundations with pile lengths ranging from 80 ft to 95 ft.

Prioritizing certain components of the project has allowed the project team to perform construction and design concurrently Nickel says. As of April foundations and piers for both ramp flyovers were almost complete and the steel tub girders over I-10 were in place. Foundation work for the flyovers along the Loyola Drive median has also begun.

The project’s design work is wrapping up and noise wall design is also nearly complete clearing the way for the fabrication of precast panels for installation along I-10.

A portion of the project will become functional this summer with the completion of a temporary access ramp to eastbound I-10 providing a more direct route during the rest of construction.

“Construction completion will allow for more streamlined traffic flow all along traffic corridors within the project area and beyond” Nickel says.

The project is on track to finish by late 2022.",,,,,,

Online poker play may be on the verge of a comeback in Nevada

Say hello to curling the next competitive sport in Las Vegas

The Nevada Gaming Commission took an unprecedented step to curb problem gaming this month: Allowing those who want to control their gambling impulses to put themselves on a list that prevents them from being able to play online games.

Adding one’s name to the newly created “self-exclusion” blocks a user’s ability to access interactive games operated on the internet. The measure does not apply to land-based gaming so anyone on the self-exclusion list can still play casino games in person without conflict.

Within the new text added to Regulation 5A are several paragraphs addressing the addition of a self-exclusion list to be overseen by the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

It’s the first time Nevada regulators have attempted monitoring such a list.

“Self-exclusion” is telling gaming regulators that you want to be prevented from being allowed to play interactive games those involving access to poker or online casino games through the internet.

Those who have never witnessed the damage that can be inflicted by problem gambling might not get why some people need to put themselves on a list to quit playing.

Having known some compulsive gamblers among friends here I was surprised but pleased to see the self-exclusion measures included in the regulation amendments.

Here are some of the key additions to the regulation:

“The board shall establish and maintain a statewide list of individuals who have self-excluded from participating in interactive gaming and the date each individual self-excluded. The board shall update the statewide list of individuals who have self-excluded each day and provide operators with access to the list.”

It’s important to note that the measure only applies to interactive gaming and not land-based gaming. Persons on the self-exclusion list can still play casino games in person without conflict.

A representative of the Control Board said the board’s Technology Division is still working through the details of how the list would work but the concept is that an individual would fill out a form available online or through a licensee before being added to the list. When individuals complete the form the operator would be required to submit it directly to the board and exclude them from participating in any interactive play.

Because interactive gaming players register with individual companies where they play it should be a simple matter to match up prospective players against the self-exclusion list to make sure they’re truly excluded.

Alan Feldman a distinguished fellow at UNLV’s International Gaming Institute and a leading authority on responsible gaming said that even though there is no evidence that self-exclusion prevents growth in problem gambling he’s glad Nevada regulators have taken a step toward establishing preventive measures.

“It’s because the act of signing up for it is a very validating and affirming action because it is now that moment where you’ve said ‘I need to do something’ and that often is a critical moment in a problem gambler’s journey” Feldman said. “Does it actually do anything for them? Do they have a better outcome ? Not really but I wouldn’t throw it all away because of that.”

Feldman has seen self-exclusion programs operated in other states and he believes Nevada is proceeding with an appropriate level of oversight. He believes Nevada licensees won’t have any problem adapting to the Control Board’s system because many of them have been required to be a part of self-exclusion programs in other states in which they operate.

What he doesn’t want to see is too much overreach by regulators where self-exclusion lists include restrictions for brick-and-mortar casinos as well as online. That scenario often includes police officers brought to a casino to arrest a self-excluded patron who entered the building. That’s not what’s happening in Nevada.

“So far” Feldman said “I think they’ve handled this appropriately.”

The infectiously feel-good track boasts enough layers of audio goodness to adhere to nearly every sweet tooth’s musical desires; from the Drake-reminiscent drum and bass beats to the magically ethereal synth melodies oscillating throughout this soon-to-be smasher is nothing short of a dreamy delicacy.

Their third collaboration — including “Wishy Washy” and featured on Haviah Mighty’s 2019 Polaris Music Prize winning release 13th Floor — Taabu (Spencer Heaslip) created the track’s firm-footed foundation first before sending it over to Omega Mighty for lyrics.

“The inspiration for the lyrics came to me when thinking about my relationship with my hubby” Omega Mighty muses of her inspiration. “He always reminds me just how special I am.

“The lyrics reference a reciprocal love” she adds likening love to being “delicious” — like melted ice cream on a hot fudge brownie the very definition of “Ooey Gooey.”

This metaphor blended well with Taabu’s own most notably considering his mantra of approaching music production like he’s “in the kitchen cooking” he says.

“The lyrics spoke to me immediately” he continues. “It’s also an analogy for the polar ebbs and flows of perfecting one’s craft… When the recipe’s just right especially after hours of hard work and dedication that gratification tastes so good.”

“Ooey Gooey” comes from Taabu’s forthcoming debut album Bellows — set for release this year — and also serves as the release’s premiere single. The track is of special significance to Taabu because “it solidifies the constant magic and synergy Omega and I have in a creative environment” he shares. “We are both versatile adaptable diverse and open minded when it comes to genre blending — and this approach has worked time and time again.”

While Bellows may be Taabu’s official debut release the multi-talented producer holds credits working with some of the biggest names in the game including work on tracks with JUNO and Polaris Prize-nominated Snotty Nose Rez Kids The Sorority TWNRVA Yviona Valdii Lex Leosis Marcio Novelli Raz and more.

“Ooey Gooey (feat. Omega Mighty)” is available now.",,,,,,,,,

Many of LP&L's customers are switching to the ERCOT grid this weekend however a misguided contract signed in 2010 with the Southwest Power Pool is preventing all of LP&L from joining ERCOT this weekend. The contract signed a decade ago was for 30% of Lubbock's electric needs for 25 years beginning in 2019.

On Thursday the Electric Utility Board and the Lubbock City Council approved the agreed upon terms to get out of the long-term contract. LP&L said this was one of the last major steps for Lubbock to fully opt into ERCOT — the first city to do so.

“Today marks an important milestone in the history of Lubbock and LP&L” Mayor Dan Pope said in a statement this week. “With the signing of this agreement Lubbock can now fully pursue its stated goal of migrating 100 percent of customers to ERCOT and look to be the first municipally owned utility in Texas to voluntarily opt-in to the retail competitive market since its creation in 1999.”

LP&L agreed to pay $77.5 million upfront to get out of the contract.

LP&L says the lump sum termination payment will be funded with long-term bonds with an estimated annual payment totaling approximately $4.1 million per year for 30 years.

It's a large payment to get out of a contract but LP&L says it's a savings from the contract it was in. LP&L says it would be paying about $17 million per year for capacity charges under the contract so LP&L says the $4.1 million per year is a savings of $12.9 million per year.

LP&L says by reducing annual costs by approximately $12.9 million per year the average residential customer will experience power cost savings in excess of 10 percent. Had this contract not been signed in 2010 which was prior to Lubbock's decision to join ERCOT the savings would be $17 million per year without the capacity charge and without the payments to get out of the contract. There is no capacity charge in ERCOT.

LP&L still needs approval from the Public Utility Commission to move the remaining 30% to the ERCOT grid. Assuming the PUC approves it LP&L says the rest of the system will be moved to ERCOT in May 2023.

When the entire system is in ERCOT LP&L says Lubbock customers will then have the opportunity to shop the retail electric market. LP&L currently resides in the Southwest Power Pool which does not have retail electric competition within its participating markets.

In January 2018 the Lubbock City Council and LP&L Electric Utility Board signed resolutions of intent to bring back competitive retail electricity to Lubbock once the ERCOT migration is complete.

The first phase of the migration into ERCOT is occurring this weekend. On Saturday and Sunday about 70% of LP&L customers are experiencing brief power outages as they get moved to the ERCOT grid. The second phase will occur in 2023 when the remaining 30% about 24000 customers move to ERCOT.

Whether a customer is switching to ERCOT this weekend has to do with the electric lines they're on. Prior to 2010 when LP&L bought out Xcel's share of the Lubbock market these two electric providers competed in Lubbock so there are two separate local electric grids in Lubbock. There are still two grids but now LP&L manages them both.

The customers moving to ERCOT this weekend are on the legacy LP&L system and the customers moving to ERCOT in 2023 are on the old Xcel system.

Lubbock connecting to ERCOT has been in the works since 2015. Joining ERCOT was the answer to what used to be called Lubbock's ""2019 decision."" Lubbock's 15-year wholesale contract with Xcel Energy that began in 2004 was set to expire in 2019 and LP&L was seeking a new power source. One of the options at the time which was maybe the leading option was for Lubbock to build its own power plant. When LP&L announced its decision to join ERCOT in 2015 city leaders said it eliminates the need to build a power plant that would cost as much as $700 million. LP&L signed a two-year contract for electric needs in SPP that expires at the end of this month.

There will not be any changes to how citizens purchase their power immediately after this weekend. LP&L will not opt-in to the competitive market in ERCOT until all customers are migrated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS93aWxkLXMtbmljay1ib25pbm8tcGxheWVkLWdhbWUtNi1ob3Vycy1hZnRlci1oaXMtc29uLXdhcy1ib3JuLzYwMDA2MjQ5OC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wild's Nick Bonino played Game 6 hours after his son was born,"LAS VEGAS – Nick Bonino arrived at Xcel Energy Center for a game Wednesday two hours before puck drop as he normally does and went through his usual warmup.

But before that his day was far from typical.

Bonino and his wife Lauren welcomed their third child a son named Bowie on Wednesday afternoon before Game 6 against Vegas in St. Paul.

""My plan was to play the whole day"" said Bonino 33. ""Everything was smooth. The baby and mom were healthy and [I was] able to get to the game at 6 [p.m.] and then felt a little bit tired in warmups. But Game 6 elimination game those are easy to get up for. I thought it was great to be a part of a win like that.""

After getting to the hospital around 7 a.m. Lauren delivered Bowie at approximately 2:30 p.m. and Bonino spent time with them while also trying to grab a snooze on the couch before taking off for the game.

The Boninos met at Boston University where both were standout hockey players. Nick Bonino played on a national championship team at BU and won two Stanley Cups with the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Lauren Cherewyk who was from St. Albert Alberta had 33 goals and 38 assists in 144 games for the Terriers women's team from 2007-11. They married in 2014.

The veteran forward faced another goodbye when he had to travel to Vegas for Game 7 on Friday; daughters Maisie and Isobel are also home with Lauren.

""He's a day old but we're in the playoffs"" Bonino said. ""We've got help at home with Lauren's family so these are things we were ready for.""

Bright lights of Game 7

Half of the players in the Wild's lineup suited up Friday night for their first career Game 7s one of the brightest spotlights in pro sports let alone the NHL and Stanley Cup playoffs.

""When you're a kid playing road hockey or shooting on the net in your backyard or front of your garage you're always talking about Game 7 game winner"" coach Dean Evason said.

""We're all kids right? We're all kids playing a game.""

Bonino brought the most Game 7 experience to the ice for the Wild appearing in six Game 7s before Friday. Ian Cole who like Bonino won Stanley Cups with the Penguins in 2016 and 2017 was next with five previous games.

Marcus Johansson who's out because of a broken left arm has logged the most Game 7s among Wild players with eight.

Four players in action for the Wild on Friday also participated in the team's last Game 7 a 5-4 overtime win at Colorado on April 30 2014.

Defenseman Jared Spurgeon tied the game at 4 with 2 minutes 27 seconds to go in the third period and Nino Niederreiter scored 5:02 in overtime to seal the comeback. Aside from Spurgeon defensemen Ryan Suter and Jonas Brodin and winger Zach Parise were also part of the rally.

""We trailed the entire game and we kept tying it up and I remember Jared scoring that late one to make it 4-4 and [goalie Ilya Bryzgalov] coming in and shutting the door and then all of a sudden Nino getting that game-winner for us"" Parise said. ""It was an exciting game. It was awesome for us as a team.

""There's just that special thing about Game 7s from a player's perspective what's on the line. They're the games you want to play in and then also from a fan's perspective they're always exciting to watch.""

Brodin injured early

The Wild lost defenseman Jonas Brodin in the first period of Friday's game when he took a hit along the boards. He didn't return meaning the Wild had to rotate five defensemen into play.

Suter played 28 minutes 50 seconds and Matt Dumba played 28:47 as they ate up most of the minutes. Brodin's night ended after only two shifts.

Center Joel Eriksson Ek who suffered a leg injury in Game 6 when he flew into a goalpost had the injury aggravated during the game but was able to continue.

The Wild played the past three games without defenseman Carson Soucy who has an undisclosed injury. Soucy skated Friday morning and was ""progressing"" Evason said meaning he likely could have returned had the Wild advanced to play Sunday against Colorado. Calen Addison again played in Soucy's place Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzODAwMC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2RvemVucy1vZi1kb2dzLWFuZC1wdXBwaWVzLWtpbGxlZC1pbi1zcGFydGEtZmlyZS1zdW5kYXktbmlnaHQvYXJ0aWNsZV9iZjFmYTQ3ZC0yYTAzLTU5YmEtOTc3Mi1iNTgzYzg2MjUwNTcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dozens of dogs and puppies killed in Sparta fire Sunday night,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

Update,"Investigation Discovery’s ‘Dark Waters: Murder in the Deep: Last Breath’ portrays the terrifying murder of Mike Delmore. When Mike was shot to death in his Mound City Minnesota home the community was left perplexed. Mike was a wonderful and helpful human being and no one could even imagine him being killed. But things came to light when it was revealed that Jeffrey Skelton’s wife Marilyn was staying at Mike’s house at the time of his murder. The subsequent manhunt for the murderer provided a chilling conclusion to the case revealing a web of hatred jealousy and rage. If you want to know more about Marilyn Skelton and where she is today we have got you covered.

Who Is Marilyn Skelton?

At the time of the slaying Jeffrey Skelton was married to Marilyn Skelton. The couple lived together in Mound City Minnesota. They were married for 15 years and shared a teenage daughter as well. Marilyn worked at Xcel Energy as a training officer and the couple shared a wonderful and happy married life. In 2005 Jeffrey learned of an alleged affair between his then-wife and another Xcel Energy co-worker named Mike Delmore. Marilyn claimed that Mike was a friend and nothing more but Jeffrey claimed to have recordings of her conversations with her alleged lover.

The couple often fought over the alleged affair and though Jeffrey tried to let it go in one instance further news of the alleged affair made his temper flare once again. On June 17 2005 Jeffrey got so angry with Marilyn that he forced her to go to Lake Minnetonka. Once at the lake in a fit of rage he pushed her into the water even after knowing that she could not swim. Jeffrey then left the location but had a sudden change of heart. He returned a few moments later and rescued Marilyn from the water before leaving her on the side of the lake.

Naturally Marilyn was terrified of her husband’s temper and chose to spend the weekend at Mike Delmore’s house. This decision did not sit well with Jeffrey who felt cheated and humiliated. Unable to control his rage he forced his way into Mike’s house and shot Mike five times in the head chest groin and feet. He then found Marilyn in the shower and pointed his gun towards her. Still Jeffrey could not bring himself to pull the trigger and thus chose to escape the murder scene. Marilyn immediately called the police and informed them of the horrifying incident that she was a witness to. A citywide manhunt was organized and approximately 6 hours later Jeffrey surrendered to the authorities.

Where Is Marilyn Skelton Now?

Even though Marilyn Skelton played an instrumental role in the capture and conviction of her ex-husband she chooses to live a quiet life at present. Marilyn Skelton prefers to stay under the radar and is highly tight-lipped regarding her private life. Furthermore Marilyn also decided not to appear on the Investigation Discovery episode. It would appear as though Marilyn has since divorced her husband. However it is unknown whether she is in a new relationship as of present. Her preference for privacy also makes it highly difficult to find her present whereabouts. We want to respect her wish to stay out of the public sphere while still wishing her the very best for the future.

In a horrifying incident that shook the entire community Michael was shot to death at his house in Mound City Minnesota. When the police received a frantic call from Marilyn Skelton they realized that the murderer was still at large. The terrifying murder case culminated in a massive manhunt to bring the culprit to justice. If you want to know more about this case and where the perpetrator is today we have got you covered.

How Did Mike Delmore Die?

Mike Delmore was a longtime resident of Mound City Minnesota. He was an extremely helpful person who loved lending a helping hand to people around him. The community held him in high regard and his neighbors often praised him for being a wonderful soul who would often assist them in their day-to-day work. Mike’s family too share a fond remembrance for him as his sister Sue said “As a brother he would mentor counsel and share his wisdom. He always made it fun kept it light.”

Mike worked at Xcel Energy as a field supervisor and was a motorcycle enthusiast. His popularity in the community was made even more evident when numerous people turned up to grieve for him after his untimely passing. On June 19 2005 the police received a frantic call from a woman named Marilyn Skelton who was living in Mike’s house at that time.

On rushing to the site of the murder the police found Mike Delmore brutally gunned down in his own house. His body was lying on the kitchen floor and an autopsy later revealed that Mike was shot five times. He had gunshot injuries in his head chest area groin and foot. After gathering information from Marilyn about the perpetrator the police realized that he was still at large. They then ordered a massive manhunt determined to bring the murderer to justice.

Who Killed Mike Delmore?

Jeffrey Skelton was convicted of Mike’s murder in 2005. Jeffrey was a Mound resident as well and lived with his then-wife Marilyn. He too worked as a supervisor in Xcel Energy. He and his wife lived a contented life and even had a teenage daughter before cracks started appearing in their relationship. In 2005 Jeffrey found out that his then-wife was acquainted with a person called Mike Delmore. This infuriated Jeffrey as he suspected that Marilyn was having an affair. When he confronted Marilyn about it she claimed that he was “just a friend” though Jeff claimed that he had recordings of her phone calls with Mike.

According to reports the couple often had altercations over the alleged affair. Further claims of the affair drove him to his breaking point. On June 17 2005 Jeffrey grew so enraged about Marilyn’s alleged affair that he lost his temper and decided to do something about it. Marilyn Skelton later said that her then-husband took her to Lake Minnetonka and forcefully pushed her into the water knowing full well that she did not know how to swim. Jeffrey then left the scene but reportedly returned sometime later. He then rescued Marilyn from the water and left her on the shore of the lake.

Marilyn scared to go back to Jeffrey decided to take refuge in Mike Delmore’s house during the weekend. Two days later on June 19 2005 Jeffrey Skelton broke into Mike’s house. Inside he found Mike in the kitchen and proceeded to gun him down in cold blood. He shot Mike 5 times before moving on to find Marilyn in the shower. Marilyn later mentioned that Jeffrey held her at gunpoint before deciding not to shoot and fleeing the scene. Marilyn immediately called the police and informed them of the murder.

Once the police were contacted they organized a massive manhunt encompassing the whole of Mound city. While the police searched for the murderer sources say that Jeffrey called WCCO Radio. The reporter who attended the call later said that a man claiming to be Jeffrey had called the station and claimed that he just wanted to shoot Mike in the foot and not kill him. According to reports 6 hours after the manhunt was initiated Jeffrey surrendered to a deputy who belonged to the Hennepin County sheriff’s office. During his surrender he said “I’ve done what I wanted to do I’ll turn myself in.”

Where is Jeffrey Skelton Now?

After his arrest Jeffrey was charged with two counts each of second-degree murder and terroristic threats. Initially his bond was set at $750000. The bail further held two conditions namely zero contact with his then-wife and residing with his relative at Park Rapids. Even though Jeffrey made bail he was found to be violating his first condition by trying to get in touch with Marilyn. Because of the violation Jeffrey was put in jail once again.

Once on trial Jeffrey pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in order to escape the mandatory life sentence. Based on his plea the judge sentenced him to 33 years in prison. In 2007 Jeffrey decided to appeal his original sentencing claiming that he was not in control of his mental capabilities during the murder. He further claimed that his guilty plea stood void as his lawyers did not inform him about using a mental illness plea in his defense. However the court dismissed his petition after Jeffrey was found mentally capable. At present Jeffrey is incarcerated at the Minnesota Correctional Facility-Stillwater and will be eligible for parole in 2027.

Sign up today to get updates on the rapidly changing nature of the food tech industry.

Greetings from Eastern Kentucky where I’m taking a quick breather from the restaurant world and am off to tour AppHarvest’s high-tech greenhouse.

But first a few quick thoughts on the recent Yum! Brands acquisition of Dragontail Systems which was announced at the end of last week. In case it wasn’t clear already Yum — parent company of Taco Bell KFC Pizza Hut and The Habit Burger Grill — has big ambitions when it comes to its technology plans. The Dragontail deal suggests that a big chunk of that ambition is to enable better delivery at its restaurants.

Australia-based Dragontail Systems is known around the restaurant biz for its AI-based workflow management system for kitchens. The system can process a restaurant’s incoming orders manage each food item’s cook time so that it’s ready when the delivery driver arrives (not before or after) assist with managing and scheduling drivers and provide real-time updates. In the past restaurants have also used Dragontail’s AI-based camera to assess food quality and ensure safety and cleanliness standards in the kitchen.

Dragontail is Yum’s third major technology acquisition so far in 2021. Earlier in the year Yum acquired AI firm Kvantum to assist with its marketing campaign analytics and Tictuk which makes omnichannel ordering software that lets consumers place orders via social media SMS email and other formats.

The Dragontail Acquisition is hyper-focused on improving delivery operations and pizza delivery in particular. Yum said it already has Dragontail installed in roughly 1500 Pizza Hut stores across 10 countries. If a wider implementation of the tech is successful Yum will eventually install the tech further around its Pizza Hut locations and eventually across all its brands.

Of course Dragontail originally debuted its system at a Domino’s location in Australia so Yum’s bid to buy the company is at least in part a way of competing. I doubt fighting Domino’s is the only motivator though as the deal seems aimed at a larger move to make food preparation more efficient at Yum restaurants.

Restaurant kitchens have always operated in a kind of orchestrated chaos but with many businesses still struggling in the wake of last year’s events efficiency is everyone’s favorite word right now. On paper Dragontail’s capabilities sound easy: managing drivers’ arrivals and departures determining more precise fire times for each food item assessing the quality of the food more precisely. But as anyone who’s ever worked in a restaurant kitchen knows getting one detail wrong can set off an entire chain of mishaps that lead to lower-quality food unhappy customers and in the end lost money. With the Dragontail acquisition Yum is placing its bets on tech to help the company avoid that scenario.
