The province says about 193000 blue plates were issued and there are just under 178000 on the road today. When they were officially scrapped officials said 145000 of the plates (which appear to be all in the CM-range) had been distributed.

The Ministry of Government Consumer Affairs refused to provide the current number of plates when CBC News published a story on warnings that went ignored when the plates which pose serious visibility issues in certain lighting conditions were rolled out in 2020.

Look around and it's not hard to spot blue plates in highway traffic or on city side streets. This reporter has also seen them on official city vehicles and Toronto police SUVs alike.

After sending a series of follow-up emails about the total number of plates officials provided the updated figure this week.

Government still working on replacement plan

The government hasn't said when Ontario drivers will be able to replace their blue plates.

""Blue licence plates remain valid and our government is developing a process to allow Ontarians to seamlessly replace them when the time comes"" said Jennifer Lipkus a spokesperson for the minister of government and consumer services.

""We continue to encourage Ontarians not to visit a ServiceOntario centre to exchange their licence plates at this time unless they are lost stolen or damaged.""

Lipkus also confirmed the province had produced about 218000 plates using material from 3M Canada.

In September the government reinstated renewal requirements for driver's licences health cards and licence plate stickers triggering a huge rush of people needing updated documents. There's also a backlog when it comes to road tests.

The blue plates which were meant to symbolize a new government of ""progress growth and prosperity"" according to government house leader Paul Calandra were scrapped after widespread criticism.

Premier Doug Ford by then dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic said he was ""just not ready to put any more resources toward this"" as he abandoned the redesign in favour of the classic blue text on white plate design.

'Virtually unreadable'

The government was immediately slammed with concerns about how hard the plates are to see at night when they hit the road.

Ontarians called them ""virtually unreadable"" in documents obtained through a freedom of information request and warned that would make it difficult to report dangerous drivers. Police officers also warned the government the plates posed a risk.

CBC News also found out through that request that the government's rollout of the plates left some organizations including the Canada Border Services Agency wondering if their technology would work with the blue design. Others recommended tweaks to the design in the lead-up to the release but the government didn't act on the advice.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvcmlzaGktc3VuYWtzLXdpZmUtYWtzaGF0YS1tdXJ0eS1sZW5kcy00LTNtLXRvLXN0YXJ0LXVwLWNhdGFtYXJhbi12ZW50dXJlcy03cGZqMzl3eHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rishi Sunak's wife Akshata Murty lends £4.3m to start-up Catamaran Ventures,"Akshata Murty the wife of Rishi Sunak lent her start-up investment company £4.3 million last year up from £1.7 million in 2019 as it slipped into the red.

Gov. Greg Abbott is still waking up every morning searching for new ways to set fire to Washington – and how to make Texas the headquarters for everything the Trump movement unleashed.

But make no mistake he and advisers in downtown Austin are talking right now about how to hawk him as a national candidate. How to sell him outside Texas. How to make sure that every one of his policy thunderclaps doesn’t derail his naked political ambitions.

Even as former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (or hey now Matthew McConaughey) thinks about toppling him in Texas Abbott remains laser focused on shouting that the Biden administration continues to bungle almost everything – especially the tragedies that always grip migrants along the Mexican border.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndzYXouY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMDMvbWFuLWFycmVzdGVkLW11cmRlci1taW5nby1jb3VudHkv0gFQaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3Nhei5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8wMy9tYW4tYXJyZXN0ZWQtbXVyZGVyLW1pbmdvLWNvdW50eS8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man charged with murder after fight with neighbor,"MINGO COUNTY W.Va.

ABBV,AbbVie,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhaW5uZXdzbmV0d29yay5vcmcvc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLzEwLzIvZmRhLWFwcHJvdmVzLWFub3RoZXItZXhwZW5zaXZlLW1pZ3JhaW5lLWRydWfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FDA Approves Another Expensive Migraine Drug — Pain News Network,"By Pat Anson PNN Editor

The highly competitive and lucrative market for migraine drugs will grow more crowded this month when AbbVie introduces Qulipta (atogepant) an oral CGRP medication developed for the prevention of episodic migraines.

The Food and Drug Administration approved Qulipta after seeing the results of a Phase 3 clinical trial that found the drug was 50 to 100% effective in preventing migraines.

""During the trial while taking Qulipta I had many fewer migraine days. For the first time ever I don't have difficulty doing my daily activities and I don't have to worry as much that a migraine attack will cause me to miss important events with family and friends"" said Kelsi Owens a trial participant who has lived with migraine for nearly three decades.

Like other CGRP inhibitors Qulipta blocks proteins called calcitonin gene-related peptides from binding to nerve receptors in the brain and causing migraine pain. Since 2018 the FDA has approved over half a dozen CGRP medications most of which are injected monthly.

Qulipta is a pill meant to be taken daily that comes in three different doses. Like other CGRP inhibitors Qulipta is expensive. The wholesale price for a patient without insurance is $991 for 30 pills according to Abbvie. Insured patients or those enrolled in an AbbVie patient support program will pay less.

""Qulipta provides a simple oral treatment option specifically developed to prevent migraine attacks and target CGRP which is believed to be crucially involved in migraine in many patients"" said study investigator Peter Goadsby MD a neurologist and professor at University of California Los Angeles. “I'm particularly encouraged by the convenience of the oral daily use of Qulipta its rapid onset of significant efficacy and its safety and tolerability as well as its high patient response rates.”

Qulipta is expected to compete directly with Nurtec an oral CGRP inhibitor made by Biohaven Pharmaceuticals that is approved for both migraine prevention and treatment. A supply of eight Nurtec tablets costs about $941 depending on insurance coverage. Since it was introduced in 2020 Nurtec has generated about $200 million in revenue for Biohaven with over 750000 prescriptions filled.

AbbVie says Qulipta will be available in early October. Wall Street analysts project Qulipta sales will reach $1 billion by 2030.

Side effects from Qulipta include nausea constipation fatigue and loss of appetite. AbbVie is currently conducting a clinical trial to seek if Qulipta should also be approved for the prevention of chronic migraine – patients who have 15 or more headaches per month.

Migraine affects more than 37 million people in the United States according to the American Migraine Foundation. In addition to headache pain migraine can cause nausea visual disturbances and sensitivity to light and sound. Women are three times more likely to suffer from migraines than men.",,,,,,,,,,,,

President Russell M. Nelson President of the Church delivers the closing address of the 191st Semiannual General Conference on Sunday afternoon Oct. 3 in the Conference Center in Salt Lake City.

Attendees leave to a conference with President Russell M. Nelson of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in La Paz Bolivia on Sunday Oct 21 2018.

President Russell M. Nelson’s Sunday announcement of future temples in 13 cities around the world reflects the Church’s growth and the dedication of countless Latter-day Saints.

The temples will be constructed in or near the following locations:

Kaohsiung Taiwan

Tacloban City Philippines

Monrovia Liberia

Kananga Democratic Republic of the Congo

Antananarivo Madagascar

Culiacán México

Here is some background on the announced temple sites — and joyous reactions from many with strong ties to those locales:

Kaohsiung Taiwan

With more than 2.75 million residents in southern Taiwan Kaohsiung is the third most populous city in Taiwan. With more than 61000 Latter-day Saints in about 110 congregations Taiwan is home to one operating temple the Taipei Taiwan Temple dedicated in 1984.

Todd Warner of South Jordan Utah lives thousands of miles from Kaohsiung — but he was still thrilled to hear a second temple will be built in Taiwan.

“When I was there 20 years ago members were hopeful that a temple would be built in Kaohsiung. They frequently discussed locations that would be perfect for a temple” he said.

Warner remembers Latter-day Saints from the Kaohsiung area renting a bus each month to travel to the temple in Taipei. “Having a temple in Kaohsiung will be a game changer for members in southern Taiwan.”

Because of the difference in time zones from Salt Lake City to the Far East Taiwan Taichung Mission President Karl J. Fields was able to break the “glorious news” to his missionaries just as they were awakening. The announcement of a temple in southern Taiwan “is the answer to many many prayers of the faithful Saints of southern Taiwan” he told the Church News.

President Fields served a full-time mission to Taiwan more than 40 years ago when the Church was still relatively young on the island. As he and his wife Sister Melanie Fields have returned as mission leaders they now find second- third- and fourth-generation Latter-day Saints who are raising “amazing young men and young women” who are serving missions.

The Church is growing and strengthening in the East Asian island country. “This is truly fulfillment of the prophecy that temples will dot the lands of the world” President Fields said.

Tacloban City Philippines

Located in the Eastern Visayas region of the Philippines Tacloban was hit by a deadly typhoon in 2013. With more than 805000 Church members in more than 1225 congregations the Philippines will have eight temples. Two are operating in Manila and Cebu City; three are under construction. in Alabang Davao and Urdaneta; and two have been announced for Bacolod and Cagayan de Oro.

“This is wonderful news because travel can be expensive even inside of the country” said Edgar Galura a Filipino Latter-day Saint.

Galura is not surprised that another temple will be added to the growing list in his Asian island country. The gospel’s message has long resonated with his people. “Filipinos are humble and have strong beliefs in God and family” he said.

Monrovia Liberia

This will be the first temple in the West African nation of Liberia which is home to about 15000 Latter-day Saints and more than 50 congregations. A coastal city Monrovia is the capital of Liberia. Missionary work began in the country in 1987.

“I am the happiest person right now” said Samuel Sayon a member from Brewerville Liberia. “I am so so excited.”

Added his fellow Liberian Latter-day Saint Alfred Mulbah of Kakata Liberia: “This is a great blessing from our Heavenly Father. He loves us.”

Texas native Jacob Egan recently returned from the Liberia Monrovia Mission. He shares the enthusiasm of his Liberian friends.

“Having a temple in Liberia will help the Church grow and provide many more opportunities for the members to serve in the temple” said Egan adding the Liberian members currently have to travel to Ghana to worship in a temple.

Kananga Democratic Republic of the Congo

The first missionaries arrived in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1986 with the country now home to more than 68000 Latter-day Saints in more than 200 congregations. DR Congo has one temple operating in Kinshasa (dedicated in 2019) and another announced for Lubumbashi.

Antananarivo Madagascar

The Church has been in Madagascar since 1993 now with 13000 Latter-day Saints in more than 40 congregations. The temple will be the nation’s first. Antananarivo is the capital of Madagascar with a population of 1.4 million.

Domoina Kendell has been hoping for a temple in her native Madagascar for the last several years.

“I have no words to express my gratitude to Heavenly Father. This will bring so many blessings for the people of Madagascar” said Kendell who moved to the United States in 2002 and lives in West Valley City Utah. “I think having a temple there will bring a different perspective” of family history work.

Currently Church members travel from Madagascar which is an island to Johannesburg South Africa — some 1700 miles (about 2735 km). She received her endowment in the Johannesburg South Africa Temple when she served a mission in Durban South Africa.

When she heard President Nelson announce a temple in Antananarivo and after the initial excitement Kendell said tears came.

“I am so happy for [the Malagasy people]. … I commend their hard work and diligence and their faith” she said.

Culiacán México

Officially named Culiacán Rosales the city in northwestern Mexico has a population of about 850000. Missionary work opened in Mexico in 1875; the country now is home to 1.5 million Latter-day Saints and about 1850 congregations. The country has 13 operating temples in Ciudad Juárez; Colonia Juárez Chihuahua; Guadalajara; Hermosillo Sonora; Mérida; Mexico City; Monterrey; Oaxaca; Tampico; Tijuana; Tuxtla Gutiérrez; Veracruz; and Villahermosa. A temple is under construction in Puebla with two announced for Torreón and Querétaro.

“My emotions can’t fit in my chest” Culiacán Mexico Stake President Marco Medina told the Church News following President Nelson’s temple announcement. “We are very happy to have received this news from our prophet. We know that the Lord has heard our prayers and we will continue to work to be worthy of it.”

President Medina said members in his stake currently have to travel approximately nine hours to visit temples in Hermosillo and Guadalajara. “Now we can do ordinances to reunite families for eternity.”

Vitória Brazil

The capital of the southeastern Brazilian state of Espírito Santo Vitória is located on a small island within a bay where several rivers meet the sea. The coastal community has two major ports. With more than 1.4 million Latter-day Saints in nearly 2150 congregations Brazil has 13 other temples — seven operating in Campinas Curitiba Fortaleza Manaus Porto Alegre Recife and São Paulo; one completed and preparing to be dedicated in Rio de Janeiro; three under construction in Belém Brasília and Salvador; with temples announced for Belo Horizonte and São Paulo East.

Wanessa Ferreira Roncate of the Jardim da Penha Ward Vitória Brazil Stake said she does not have words to explain her excitement about a new temple in Vitória. Members in her area currently travel 13 hours to attend the Campinas Brazil Temple about 620 miles (1000 km) away.

“We were already immensely happy and grateful for the Rio temple which cuts the trip in half and we look forward to its dedication” she told the Church News. Now having a temple in Vitória will be “a privilege and blessing.”

“It’s one more testimony that God sees our efforts that He loves us and cares for us” she said. “The Lord is hastening His work and what a privilege to be a part of it. We have a lot of work to do on both sides of the veil and it’s not just any work it’s the best work ever. It is the Lord’s work.”

La Paz Bolivia

With more than 212000 Church members Bolivia will have three temples — one in Cochabamba which was dedicated in 2000 and another announced last year by President Nelson for Santa Cruz. The third temple will serve members in the cities of La Paz and El Alto where the Church has seen significant growth.

La Paz native Guizella Rocabado fought back emotion considering how the future temple will forever change her country’s administrative capital.

Civil troubles are common in the city she said. A dedicated temple can bring unity and light to La Paz.

“I hope that this temple can bring peace to the area — I know that it will” she told the Church News moments after President Nelson’s announcement. “The people need some rest. They need peace and something they can look to for answers and purpose.”

On a personal level Rocabado’s late father Gustavo Rocabado worked as an engineer at the Bolivia Cochabamba Temple. “I know how excited he must be.”

Santiago West Chile

The temple will be the fourth in the country and the second in the capital city joining the Santiago Chile Temple (dedicated in 1983) Concepción Chile Temple (2018) and the Antofagasta Chile Temple (under construction). More than 600000 Latter-day Saints in over 500 congregations call Chile home. Santiago is the country’s largest city with a population of nearly 7 million residents.

“The announcement of the new temple for the western area of Santiago de Chile in the midst of a fight against the pandemic comes from the heavens through our prophet” wrote M. Gonzalo Sepúlveda a Chilean Latter-day Saint and a former Area Seventy.

“It is a powerful injection of spirituality [in Santiago] that will bless the lives of its inhabitants on both sides of the veil.”

Fort Worth Texas

With more than 360000 Church members Texas has five temples already — operating temples in nearby Dallas as well as Houston San Antonio and Lubbock with a temple in McAllen under construction. Fort Worth is located west of Dallas in north-central Texas where missionary work dates back to 1843.

“We are so excited because the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is growing so fast” said Erik Egan of the Lewisville Texas Stake. “To have a temple in the Fort Worth area will be a great blessing.”

Egan said COVID-19’s ongoing effect on temple work has given many Latter-day Saints in his community a heightened appreciation for temple work. Now they rejoice that a temple will be closer than ever to their bustling Texas community

Cody Wyoming

This will be the third temple in Wyoming where approximately 68000 people are Latter-day Saints or one of every nine residents in the state. Wyoming’s first temple is operating in Star Valley; the second in Casper will have its groundbreaking later this week on Oct. 9.

Cody located in northwest Wyoming just east of Yellowstone is a small farm town with a population of about 10000. Named for Colonel William Frederick “Buffalo Bill” Cody the town is known as the “rodeo capital of the world.”

“I’m stunned and just so grateful that the Prophet felt like we needed a temple in Cody” said Cody Wyoming Stake President Andrew Jacobsen. “To have a temple here will be a blessing for the entire Big Horn Basin.”

A native of Cody President Jacobsen said the future temple will allow local Latter-day Saints to enjoy more conversations with their neighbors about the gospel.

When Amanda Parks of the Cody 4th Ward Cody Wyoming Stake heard President Nelson read the name of her town she was shocked. “My Facebook feed is all ‘What?’ ‘Cody Wyoming?’ ‘Really?’ People are superexcited” she said.

Parks said her town has a strong Latter-day Saint community. “It’s really exciting” she said of the new temple. “I know everyone here is really excited for the blessings that come from that and it’s going to be really awesome.”

Members in the area currently travel about 90 miles (about 145 km) to Billings Montana to serve in the temple.

Rexburg North Idaho

In addition to Sunday’s announced second temple for Rexburg the city is home to one of Idaho’s five operating temples — the others are in Boise Meridian Idaho Falls and Twin Falls. The Pocatello Idaho Temple will be dedicated on Nov. 7 and a future temple in Burley has a site and a rendering. The state has more than 460000 members in nearly 1200 congregations with early Church pioneers first settling in what is now Idaho in 1855.

Kimbal Smith is a Brigham Young University-Idaho student and native of Southeastern Idaho. He knows well the area’s strong Latter-day Saint presence. Still he was not expecting President Nelson’s temple announcement. It made for an unexpected gift.

“It was a surprise that there would be another temple in Rexburg because of the temple already here and temples close by in Idaho Falls and [soon] in Pocatello.”

Still he is humbled by what a second temple represents: a sacred responsibility to serve and perform essential family history work.

“We will have no excuse not to go to the temple” he said.

Heber Valley Utah

Heber Valley is in Utah’s Wasatch County about 40 miles (64 km) from Salt Lake City. With more than 2.1 million members of the Church in some 5230 congregations Utah is home to 27 temples. Dedicated temples include the Bountiful Brigham City Cedar City Draper Jordan River Logan Manti Monticello Mount Timpanogos Ogden Oquirrh Mountain Payson Provo Provo City Center Salt Lake St. George and Vernal temples. Others under construction or announced are the Deseret Peak Ephraim Layton Lindon Orem Red Cliffs Saratoga Springs Smithfield Syracuse and Taylorsville temples.

“My heart exploded with so much happiness; my daughter Ellie jumped off the couch saying ‘No way!’ — and my phone started blowing up with excitement from friends and family” said Taunya Olsen a member of the Old Mill 2nd Ward Heber City Utah Old Mill Stake.

“I’m literally in tears knowing the spirit of the temple of the Lord’s house will be nestled in our valley. It’s like a blanket of hope and peace and love and joy.”

Each of these risks must be addressed but their roots and remedies are entirely different.

Defense and national security

Beginning several decades ago two things transformed the semiconductor industry and have put the defense and aerospace sectors at risk. First semiconductor manufacturers by the dozens abandoned these markets to pursue the higher volumes of commercially-driven consumer applications. Then to more cost-effectively support these higher volumes they transitioned to subcontracted overseas manufacturing mainly in Taiwan and China.

The first issue is as concerning as the second. Simultaneous with the U.S. share of global semiconductor manufacturing dropping from 37% in 1990 to 12% today there has been equally alarming drop in the number of the U.S. companies who design and supply these mission-critical semiconductors.

Industry consolidation accounted for some of the decline. Most of this consolidation has led to a de-emphasis of Department of Defense (DoD) NASA and other government engagements since accretive acquisitions typically result in cuts to these generally peripheral portions of the acquiring company’s business. Microelectronics suppliers were also being lured to more lucrative commercial state-of-the-art (SOTA) opportunities and today the number of semiconductor companies with a meaningful defense sector businesses has shrunk dramatically.

This dearth of suppliers is as much of a risk to the U.S. defense and aerospace sector as the offshoring of so much U.S. semiconductor manufacturing to China and Taiwan which became an even greater concern after he trade war with China began. This was followed by increasing aggression in the South China Sea and Hong Kong and the actions and statements made by the Chinese Communist Party in the early stages of the pandemic. U.S. policy needs to address both the commercial and DoD sector issues by creating an environment that incentivizes private investment for onshore manufacturing – not just of SOTA components but also mission-critical semiconductors.

An important first step is the bi-partisan American Foundries Act and its successful addition in July 2020 as an amendment to the Senate’s Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which also includes provisions of the original bipartisan CHIPS for America Act for semiconductor incentive and R&D programs that was authorized but never funded. Also important is the Endless Frontier Act that was expanded in May 2021 and renamed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA). It includes $52 billion in emergency funding to implement the CHIPS Act and allocates $2 billion to “solely focus on legacy chip production to advance economic and national security interests as these chips are essential to the auto industry the military and other critical industries.” The price tag on the bill at one point ballooned to over $250 billion which has caused it to slow down for further debate prior to being passed in the Senate.

The next step is to change the NDAA language so that it also includes the mission-critical and integration-level semiconductors required for military and aerospace applications. This addition would better support the fragile global supply chain for Pentagon-military and space qualified semiconductor manufacturing applications and integration. This qualification process is substantially more rigorous than that in the commercial sector. For instance devices like field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) used in for onboard satellite payload processing need to be qualified to reliability specifications geared to extremely harsh space environments. The same is true of military and space-qualified discrete semiconductors that are the staples of weapons and space system platforms. In some cases they are 60 years old but still desperately needed by both prime and sub-prime contractors.

Fewer and fewer companies supply these products or are even capable of meeting their qualification requirements which creates the potential for looming capacity and capability constraints. In short the military and aerospace market simply does not have the sales volumes to support the continuing technology investment required to attract suppliers. U.S. policymakers must address the massive resulting gaps that have created today’s shrinking military and aerospace electronics supply chain.

Commercial sector

The commercial sector shortage has continued to worsen and the current order rate is outpacing the capacity that semiconductor companies can bring on board. It is a constraint the industry will likely see through the rest of the year most likely into 2022.

The issues that created this crisis have been brewing for some time dating back to late 2018 and early 2019 when tariffs started to create headwinds for many customers. They could not absorb the tariffs and their end consumers could not bear the prices so demand went down in 2019. And then as things began to improve and supply chains realigned so that products destined for the United States could be built outside of China the industry was hit by the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic through the first half of 2020. It added to the demand slide especially in the automotive industrial and consumer sectors. Everyone stopped buying.

As the slowdown happened companies leaned out inventories and started to idle factories to run less than what they could normally produce. Moving forward through the slowdown manufacturers could not get a demand signal from their customers that provided enough warning to start up manufacturing again. This is problematic for an industry where it takes six months of cycle time from when there is a “go” signal as there was in September 2020 to when factories can be ramped up and/or capital investments can be made to expand capacity and production can begin to return to full force again. The industry has had to catch up from where it was back in late 2019 and early 2020.

Today’s supply issues are exacerbated by manufacturers who compete over the same fab capacity. This can be tracked back to the transition from vertical integration to predominately fabless manufacturing. As fab construction costs skyrocketed many semiconductor companies moved to a “fab-lite” model shifting their resources to chip design. They produced some chips in their own fabs while outsourcing some production to foundries. Some went fabless or they exited the business. Then the 2001 recession hastened an industry contraction which launched a consolidation chapter while also accelerating offshoring. The result has been a much weaker industry ecosystem today that was far more vulnerable to the whipsaw impact of the recent pandemic.

Policy priorities

The commercial sector will continue to see supply and demand imbalances resulting from normal economic cycles. But there are also policy initiatives in the medium to long term that will be important to support a stronger U.S. semiconductor infrastructure including both R&D and manufacturing capability. The biggest issue is the manufacturing side which will likely take at least three years to address once government initiatives are launched. Meanwhile it will likely take at least 6-8 quarters to resolve the commercial shortage not just in automotive but across all end markets.

To ensure availability of microelectronics for U.S. defense aerospace and homeland security needs policymakers need to consider the special circumstances of this increasingly fragile dedicated supply chain. Modifying the NDAA bill to include support specifically for mission-critical and integration-level semiconductor suppliers is a first step toward shoring up a shrinking supplier base so it can continue to provide components that pass the rigorous qualification tests that ensure they can be used in much harsher environments for much longer periods of time than the typical commercial semiconductor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8wMi9oZWFsdGgvd2FzaGluZy10b3dlbHMtaG93LW9mdGVuLXdlbGxuZXNzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUtodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIxLzEwLzAyL2hlYWx0aC93YXNoaW5nLXRvd2Vscy1ob3ctb2Z0ZW4td2VsbG5lc3M?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How often should you wash your towels?,"CNN —

There is nothing like wrapping yourself up in a fluffy warm towel after a hot shower or bath.

After drying yourself however the towel also gets wet. Now it’s the perfect home for germs. Hopefully you’re hanging it up to dry but that doesn’t keep your towel clean.

That’s why CNN turned to an expert to learn how often towels should be washed to prevent them from getting us dirty which is the exact opposite of its intended use.

Wash your towels at least once a week. That’s the rule of thumb that Manal Mohammed senior lecturer of medical microbiology at the University of Westminster in the United Kingdom recommended.

Can I reuse a towel after one use?

It's OK to reuse a towel a few times before you wash and dry -- and it's better for the environment too. Adobe Stock

Reusing towels a few times is better for the environment and likely won’t be a cause for alarm. But as soon as you notice any funky smells it’s definitely time for a wash since this is an indication of fungal and bacterial growth Mohammed said.

“Towels are not clean as you think and can transmit germs” Mohammed said.

And during the pandemic anyone infected by Covid-19 in your home should use separate towels.

“It is not known how long coronavirus can survive on towels but it is very important not to share towels with infected people or self-isolating people at the household” Mohammed said.

How do germs end up on towels?

Every time you use or touch a towel you transfer any germs on your body to that towel. That’s why it’s recommended – even before the pandemic – to wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds.

“If you do not wash your hands properly – for at least 20 seconds – especially after using the toilet as it is full of germs these can easily be transferred to your towel” Mohammed said.

And our towels can even get dirtier in the wash if not done properly.

Washing towels with high-risk items such as underwear which is more likely to hold traces of feces or bacteria from genital infections can increase the chances that our towels aren’t as clean as we’d like them. For this same reason towels should never be washed with items heavily soiled with bodily fluids such as vomit.

Just like proper washing is important for a clean towel so is proper drying after use. Not allowing towels to fully dry can create an excellent environment for bacterial growth.

“Damp used towels in moist bathrooms encourage microbial growth” she said. “Although most of these germs are often harmless some of them (including Staphylococcus bacteria) can cause infection and health problems especially in people with skin wounds and immunocompromised people.”

How dirty do our towels really get?

Keep your towels hung and aired out -- they can spread all sorts of nasty things if they stay damp between uses. Adobe Stock

Fungi including the pathogen that causes tinea cruris (jock itch) can spread through shared towels according to Mohammed. Dermatophytic fungi such as those that cause athlete’s foot can cause infections in cuts or sensitive skin.

“Do not get excited when athletes throw their towels at you!” said Mohammed.

Some infections can be even more serious such as Staphylococcus bacteria. While it normally lives on our skin if bacteria enters through a wound the infection that results is resistant to antibiotics.

Towels can also spread bacteria that cause acne. Mohammed advises avoiding this by not sharing towels with others. Pink eye or conjunctivitis can also spread since the fabric comes into contact with the face and eyes.

Since towels are kept right next to one of the germiest places in your home the toilet it shouldn’t be the biggest surprise that sometimes what we flush ends up on our towels. Coliforms such as E. coli can transfer to towels because of this.

These bacteria normally live in our gastrointestinal tract and are associated with fecal matter and can cause food poisoning and urinary tract infections.

Washing kitchen towels separate from bathroom towels also reduces the risk of bacteria spreading.

A 2014 study of kitchen hand towels found that 89% were home to coliform bacteria and 25% had E. coli. The towels were collected from households in five major cities in the United States and Canada.

Keeping towels clean

To start don’t share towels whenever possible. Those towels that are shared such as hand towels should be replaced with a clean towel daily.

Wash your towels without any other items if possible – or at least not with high-risk items such as underwear.

Use hot water to wash towels to ensure removing germs.

Mohammed suggests washing them on the “hot” setting of your washing machine. Ideally this is 140°F (60°C) but she says “the hotter the wash the better” — if they are particularly dirty you can even wash them at 194°F (90°C.) If you use a bleach-based laundry product you can wash them at 104°F (40°C.)

After your towels come out of the wash and between each use ensure they are thoroughly dry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFqbWMuY29tL3ZpZXcvbW9kZXJuLWdlbmUtdGhlcmFwaWVzLXNob3ctcHJvbWlzZS1pbi1tb3Rvci1uZXVyb24tZGlzb3JkZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Modern Gene Therapies Show Promise in Motor Neuron Disorders,"Gene therapies are novel yet promising strategies for treating motor neuron disorders (MNDs) such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). These diseases are characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy respiratory failure and early death—but recent years have seen increased research and expanding treatment options for patients. A review of MND research overall and the gene therapies tested in clinical trials for MNDs highlights promising strategies to approach treatment.

SMA the most common genetic cause of child mortality was considered fatal and incurable until 2017. There are 5 types of SMA and mortality is particularly high in type 1 which presents in infancy. Less than 8% of these patients survive for 20 months. ALS is the most common type of adult-onset MND in clinical practice. Onset is typically between ages 40 and 70 years and most patients experience respiratory failure within 3 to 5 years.

The first novel drug approved for SMA was nusinersen which modifies splicing of the SMN2 pre-mRNA resulting in the production of full‐length SMN protein. A second therapy onasemnogene abeparvovec originally known as AVXS‐101 was approved by FDA for intravenous therapy in patients with SMA under 2 years of age in 2019.

In ALS just 2 noncurative drugs are approved both of which slightly improve quality of life by slowing progression of the disease. Riluzole a glutamate antagonist that prolongs the survival of patients by a few months was approved in 1995 and delays the onset of ventilator dependence and tracheostomy. Edaravone approved by the FDA in 2017 acts as a free radical scavenger. It slows disease progression by reducing oxidative stress and protecting neurons specifically in patients who start treatment in the early stages of the disease.

These MNDs differ significantly when it comes to the number of causative genes. Research has identified more than 35 causative genes in ALS the most common mutations occurring in C9orf72 SOD1 TARDP and FUS. It is also multifactorial with environmental factors also playing a role in its pathogenesis. Most cases are sporadic ALS (sALS) but some have familial history (fALS). SMA on the other hand is most commonly caused by a homozygous mutation of the SMN1 gene on chromosome 5q13.3.

In both MNDs overall gene therapies hold promise for treatment. The review highlighted several types of vector-mediated gene therapies:

Retroviral/lentiviral vectors

Herpes simplex vectors

Adenoviral vectors

Adeno-associated vectors (AAVs)

“All drugs that contain an active substance that includes or consists of a recombinant nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) administered to a human being for the purpose to adjust repair replace add or remove a gene sequence can be defined as gene therapy” the author wrote. Viral vector technologies and RNA modulating therapy are gene therapies most relevant to MNDs.

In SOD1-linked fALS and C9orf72-linked ALS clinical and preclinical research has found that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) might be effective in targeting the mutated genes. A patient with early-onset ALS Jaci Hermstad was treated with a personalized ASO to target an FUS mutation after the US House of Representatives passed a bill and the FDA approved Hermstad’s treatment.

ASOs are also being developed in preclinical settings to target mRNAs that encode the disease‐modifying proteins that play a part in motor neuron death in ALS. Given most ALS cases are sporadic therapies targeting mutant genes are impossible in most cases the review author notes. Therefore targeting pathogenic pathways associated with ALS is of interest. Disturbances of RNA metabolism stress granule (SG) response and protein degradation pathways are key mechanisms. SGs are protein-RNA complexes that form due to genetic or environmental factors.

In sporadic and familial ALS mutations of angiogenin gene (ANG) which is expressed in motor neurons and protects cultured motor neurons against injury have been identified. This may be another therapeutic route in ALS.

Viral vector gene therapy for ALS has also been explored in preclinical studies with vectors constructed using human therapeutic genes VEGF165 and ANG under the construction term “AdeVasc.” A phase 2 clinical trial showed efficacy in a high-dose cohort slowing disease progression and motor and respiratory decline.

Overall the review author highlights AAV-based viral vectors as the most promising strategy but cites cost as one major drawback. The most expensive drug in the world the AAV9-based onasemnogene abeparvovec (sold as Zolgensma by Novartis) is priced at $2.1 million per treatment she notes.

The review concludes on an optimistic tone that the future of MND treatment particularly ALS will brighten given the common molecular pathways of neurodegeneration in MNDs.

“Over the last 2 decades gene therapy using ASOs or viral vectors has emerged as the most promising strategy for treating MNDs” the author wrote. ""Through developing ASO‐ and virus vector‐mediated drugs for SMA much has been understood about opportunities of gene therapy in all MNDs including ALS one of the most fatal and progressive forms of the MNDs spectrum.”

ASML (ASML 1.83%) and Intel (INTC -0.80%) are two of the most important semiconductor companies in the world. ASML is the top supplier of photolithography systems which are used to etch circuit patterns into silicon wafers. Intel is the top producer of CPUs for PCs and data centers.

ASML is also the world's only provider of high-end EUV (extreme ultraviolet) systems which are used to manufacture the world's smallest chips. That's why it's a key partner for Intel which owns a small stake in ASML as well as its top foundry competitors TSMC and Samsung.

ASML and Intel both attracted a lot of attention throughout the global chip shortage which started in late 2019 and worsened throughout the pandemic. But over the past three years ASML's stock surged about 300% as Intel's stock rose less than 15%.

ASML benefited from the market's insatiable appetite for new photolithography systems while Intel struggled with ongoing shortages delays and manufacturing issues. Let's take a fresh look at both companies and see if ASML remains a stronger investment than Intel.

ASML continues to fire on all cylinders

ASML's revenue rose just 8% in 2019 as the global glut in memory chips curbed the market's appetite for new systems. However its revenue increased 18% in 2020 as the memory market stabilized and the top foundries boosted their capacity to cope with the surging demand for new chips.

ASML's earnings per share increased just 1% in 2019 but jumped 38% in 2020 as it sold more higher-margin EUV systems. Its total EUV sales rose 60% and accounted for 32% of its full-year revenues.

In the first half of 2021 ASML's revenue rose 45% year over year as its EPS soared 110%. Analysts expect its full-year revenue and earnings to grow 35% and 58% respectively as TSMC Samsung and Intel install more EUV systems. All three foundries are spending billions of dollars on building new plants and a lot of that money will flow to ASML.

Next year analysts expect ASML's revenue and earnings to increase 15% and 22% respectively. Its growth will likely decelerate as the chip shortage ends but its business should keep expanding over the long term as it rolls out its next generation of high-NA EUV systems -- which will be used to manufacture chips that are even smaller than today's tiniest chips.

Intel prepares for a painful turnaround

Intel's revenue grew just 2% in 2019 but rose 8% in 2020 as it shipped more PC and data center chips throughout the pandemic. The shift to remote work boosted demand for new PCs while the heavier usage of online services forced data centers to upgrade their hardware.

Intel's adjusted EPS rose 6% in 2019 and grew 9% in 2020. However it boosted its EPS with billions of dollars in buybacks throughout both years instead of allocating that cash toward improving its R&D and manufacturing capabilities. That trend worried investors since Intel had already fallen behind TSMC and Samsung in the ""process race"" to create smaller and more advanced chips.

In the first half of 2021 Intel's revenue dipped 1% year over year as its EPS fell 18%. Those declines can be attributed to its market-share losses to AMD (AMD -0.31%) in the PC and data center markets as well as tough comparisons to the pandemic's initial impact a year ago.

Analysts expect Intel's revenue and earnings to decline 6% and 10% respectively this year. Intel's new CEO Pat Gelsinger who took the helm in February plans to aggressively expand Intel's manufacturing plants to reclaim the process lead from TSMC by 2025. That's an ambitious goal but there's no guarantee that it will succeed and reverse its market losses to AMD -- which currently outsources the production of its chips to TSMC's superior foundries.

The obvious winner: ASML

ASML trades at 47 times forward earnings while Intel has a much lower forward P/E ratio of 11. However ASML's near-monopoly in photolithography systems its role as a linchpin of the global semiconductor market and its robust growth rates all justify that higher valuation. Meanwhile Intel's stock deserves a lower valuation because it faces a grueling uphill battle against TSMC and AMD.

Intel's downside potential could be limited at these levels but ASML has a lot more upside potential -- especially as the global chip shortage drags on and highlights the importance of its EUV systems.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9tZWFuLWdpcmxzLXN0YXJzLWxpbmRzYXktbG9oYW4tMjAyNzQ5NzcwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mean Girls stars Lindsay Lohan Jonathan Bennett and Amanda Seyfried mark October 3,"In case you wanted to know what day it is the Mean Girls cast is here to remind you that it's October 3 AKA Mean Girls day.

The 23-year-old O’Neill stayed unbeaten in her young career by getting into full mount on Shevchenko and pounding away with strikes until the fight was mercifully stopped at the 4:47 mark of Round 2.

Check out the highlights of O’Neill’s handiwork below (via Twitter):

Australia’s O’Neill is off to a hot start in the octagon and said her victory over Shevchenko proved she can compete with the elite at 125 pounds.

“I felt good” O’Neill said in her post-fight interview with Daniel Cormier. “I say time and time again just because I don’t have the opportunity to fight people like this doesn’t mean I’m not capable of that. … I’m for real and I hope I showed that to everyone tonight.”

The Airbnb host known as “Nancy” has been deleted from the company’s online listings after cops last week seized seven vans authorities said had been used for at least two years as cut-rate Airbnb rentals.

“We do not tolerate this behavior and Airbnb prohibits stays to be listed on public lands. Both the Host and listings in question have been banned from the Airbnb platform” an Airbnb spokesman said.

The spokesman did not give specifics about “Nancy” or address how the company issued her a verified checkmark which is required to use Airbnb as a host or a guest in the U.S.

In a series of since-removed posts on the app the vans were touted as a funky way for tourists to take a bite out of the Big Apple on the cheap for under $100 a night.

An observant traffic enforcement agent noticed something off about the vehicles — five of which were parked in the East Village — whose registration and N.J. plates were long expired some going as far back as 2000 sources said.

With global demand for cleaner energy to power cars smart homes and phones predicted to rise forty-fold through 2040 a different silvery metal stands to replace the Comstock Lode of yore as the namesake product of the Silver State.

That high-energy metal lithium is so light it floats on water before fizzing away in a chemical reaction. Nevada’s economic future is hard-wired to it and the industries its production supports.

The state already occupies a prominent if not quite dominant place in lithium’s past and present as a potent clean energy source. The leading method for obtaining it – extracting it from underground brines – was perfected in Nevada and is now used worldwide.

At Silver Peak in Esmeralda County roughly halfway between Las Vegas and Reno a lithium facility has operated since the mid-1960s and is still the only lithium producer in the U.S. Lithium is recovered there by evaporating the brine in large ponds in a process that takes 18-24 months.

Now Nevada by the same accident of geography and geology that makes it a mining mecca for all kinds of metals and minerals is poised to see lithium production skyrocket fueling its economic growth along with its ambitions to become for energy transmission “what Wall Street is to finance or what Silicon Valley is to technology” as Gov. Steve Sisolak said in his 2021 state of the state address in January.

A deposit at Thacker Pass in Humboldt County near the Oregon border where mining production is slated to start next year is thought to be the largest lithium deposit in North America and potentially the world. Mining the clays of a prehistoric volcanic caldera there could produce more than 3 million tons of lithium carbonate a primary compound in battery production with operations continuing for nearly half a century.

That potential windfall is not without its detractors mostly environmentalists and some residents including a subset of the area’s Native American population. Opponents charge that the project and operations like it will adversely affect area flora and fauna not to mention groundwater and other natural resources. Legal challenges to stop or slow Thacker Pass on those grounds have thus far been turned away with a federal judge to date finding no fault with the approval and permitting process.

A broader issue is the paradox inherent with some efforts to harness cleaner energy to fight galloping climate change: What regional resource – say a rare plant species as in the case of another planned lithium project in the Nevada desert – could be sacrificed in the name of helping the planet globally?

Add to that a corollary: With cleaner energy resources such as lithium critical to meeting carbon reduction goals is it better from a global perspective to recover them in regions of the world where stricter regulations and oversight govern the process?

“You can’t decide where you want to build the mine. The mine is built where the resources are and sometimes that’s a hard concept for people to understand” said Mike Visher administrator of the state Division of Minerals in recent interview.

“All of the metals that are needed for your phone come out of the ground” he said. “So where do you want them to come from? From a place where it’s highly regulated or from a third world country where nobody’s paying attention? And what’s more environmentally responsible for the world?”

Present and future mining

At Silver Peak mineral salts precipitate out in stages across some 4000 acres of evaporation ponds from subsurface brine that is five to ten times saltier than ocean water. The operation employs fewer than 100 people and is the only one of its kind in the U.S.

Not far away to the west at Rhyolite Ridge a lithium-boron mine could start production in 2024. Australia-based operator ioneer recently partnered on the project with a South African mining concern that paid $490 million to buy into the venture – a telling indicator of where the lithium market stands.

American Lithium Corp. an exploration company continues to sample and drill at its 7500-acre TLC Lithium Project site near Tonopah. The site is northwest of Silver Peak and sits on the same geologic formation. Also nearby in Clayton Valley a pilot project led by mining services giant Schlumberger and battery maker Panasonic is developing a new way to extract lithium from subsurface brine injecting it back into the ground without using additional water.

Operations at Silver Peak which is owned by North Carolina-based Albemarle Corp. one of the largest lithium producers worldwide are dwarfed by production in places like Chile Australia and China; Silver Peak now produces about 1 percent of worldwide output – less than one-fifth of what the Tesla/Panasonic battery Gigafactory outside Reno uses in a year. Albemarle announced plans in January to double production there over the next five years.

Silver Peak is a “fairly small resource” that has operated largely “under the radar screen” – until interest in electric vehicles and other uses for lithium took off says Eric Norris president of Albemarle’s lithium business. Production there ultimately is constrained by the amount of brine that can be extracted annually but overall the potential for lithium related businesses is “extraordinarily exciting.”

Besides limited production in the U.S. there is currently no refining capacity here to supply the materials needed by battery megafactories. There are now three in the U.S. including the Tesla/Panasonic plant with five more anticipated by 2024. What Silver Peak produces is shipped to Asia to be made into cathodes for batteries.

“So even if we were to have a significant expansion of capacity today chances are we’ll still be doing a lot of exporting that back to Asia before that product came back here to the U.S.” Norris said.

That inevitably will change as traditional automakers follow Tesla into the EV market. Ford last week announced it would spend more than $11 billion over the next four years to build four EV factories.

“I think we’ve gone beyond the tipping point” Norris said. “That’s going to drive that supply chain into the U.S. And so that’s one reason we’re expanding Silver Peak.”

Nevada production small about to boom

Overall the value of Nevada’s lithium production is minuscule. In 2019 it amounted to less than half a percent of all mining production in the state – 7.9 million pounds valued at $36 million against more than $8 billion for all metals and minerals. But that again represented the entire U.S. lithium output.

While not rare lithium was labeled “critical” to the nation’s economic and national security in a June White House report on resilient supply chains. With about 4 percent of known global lithium reserves the U.S. ranks fifth in the world behind Chile – far and away the largest source – followed Australia Argentina and China.

The U.S. is also well behind in global production. According to data compiled in BP’s annual Statistical Review of World Energy it tied at seventh with Portugal in 2020 at just under 1 percent. Australia produced 40 percent followed by Chile at nearly 21 percent China at 14 percent Argentina at 6 percent and Brazil and Zimbabwe at 1.9 percent and 1.2 percent respectively.

Those U.S. production numbers will change and Nevada stands both to drive that change and benefit from it. Sisolak in his 2021 state of the state address anchored his call to make Nevada a national hub for electrical grid storage and transmission noting that the state “is home to the most accessible lithium reserves in North America.”

Nevada’s ambitions not only as a lithium producer but also as a hub for power generation storage and transmission for the Western United States are built into its long-term energy aspirations which include conservation as well.

“The potential for us to become a worldwide leader in lithium production is significant” Sen. Pat Spearman D-North Las Vegas told a legislative committee last spring regarding her resolution seeking a legislative study on developing production of lithium and other clean-energy minerals.

Demand for electric cars batteries and recycling technology and electronics offer “key opportunities for economic development providing much-needed high paying jobs and increased tax revenue” she added not to mention helping “decrease carbon emissions improve air quality and protect the respiratory health of Nevadans particularly those in our communities of color or who are economically disadvantaged.” The resolution passed the Senate but did not get a vote in the Assembly.

Lithium brings jobs related businesses

The Thacker Pass project is a poster child for the state’s claims and ambitions standing as both the largest and highest-grade known sedimentary deposit of lithium in the U.S. It lies near the surface in soft material that it will be mined in stages down to a maximum depth of 400 feet with minimal blasting.

The developer Lithium Americas plans a two-phase project that initially will produce 33000 tons of battery-grade lithium carbonate annually for the first four years doubling that output thereafter. The site is located on 18000 acres of public lands of which about one-third of which would be disturbed. The open pit would be backfilled in stages during the life of mine.

Projections include more than 800 construction jobs at the outset and 300 permanent jobs during its operation along with jobs for suppliers of products and services and tax payments of $6.7 billion to governments depending on lithium pricing. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved the project in January.

Beyond production Lithium Americas’ president and CEO Jonathan Evans says the U.S. needs to look at expanding capacity through the entire supply chain to avoid losing out on downstream demand for the finished products. The U.S. will never be self-sufficient in lithium but failing to build out the industries that rely on it is a missed opportunity that also threatens supply chain security he said.

“I remember when consumer electronics sort of left (the U.S.) and you didn’t even notice it” Evans says. “This you’ll notice because there’s so much investment going into automotive companies so much commitment that it would be a shame for these types of jobs to go away.”

Nevada he said “is in a unique position where you can have the complete ecosystem in the state” from raw materials to processing to manufacturing. “I can’t think of any other state where that’s even a reality at this point and you’ve got some great cornerstone businesses there that you can build on.”

Environmental concerns

None of that mollifies project opponents which include environmental organizations a local rancher and certain Native American tribes who have sued to stop the project. They cite impacts on wildlife – among them a golden eagle nesting pair and habitat for the sage grouse – along with depleting groundwater sources and disturbing potential historical and culturally significant tribal sites. There are also those who oppose all mining in a wilderness area on principle.

A federal judge in Reno so far has denied requests for injunctions finding no evidence that the project permitting process was wrongly fast-tracked with mitigation measures in place for contingencies. A ruling on the merits of the case is expected by early next year.

Lithium Americas says its efforts to mitigate and minimize impacts includes a commitment to make the project carbon neutral. It plans to recycle the sulfuric acid it will manufacture on site to leach lithium from the clay use heat created in that process to generate power tap into geothermal sources for its remaining power needs and has committed permanently to stay out of the adjacent Montana mountains – a prime sage grouse habitat. It also has engineered the project to minimize light pollution and traffic impacts.

The company purchased water rights from two ranches in nearby Orovada and says it will draw the same amount of water over the course of a full year that currently gets used during growing season only. It has worked with area stakeholders including the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe and cites far more local support than opposition.

“I think the voices of dissent are pretty small but they’re loud” Evans said. “All those issues whether it’s the wildlife water air emissions have extensive work that’s been done prior to the formal permitting process.”

“People always talk about we’re fast tracking things in the U.S. Far from it” he added. “Things take longer in the U.S. to develop than probably anywhere else in the world based on the very extensive permitting regimes that we have to go through public comment periods and so forth.”

Norris from Albemarle makes a similar point. The briny water Silver Peak relies on is nowhere near potable. Drawn from a terminal basin there’s a limit to how much can be sustainably drawn and replenished over time. There is also the question of marketing.

“When you think about this industry what we are doing is not only trying to be responsible in the environment which is critically important but beyond that it’s what our customers want of us” Norris said. Companies building electric vehicles for example “want a product that we certify as being sustainable because they’re marketing a car that’s supposed to be sustainable. So they’ve got to make sure that their supply base does the same.”

Evaporating brines with sunlight – which also recovers additional mineral salts – uses little energy. For the Silver Peak plant “when we add it all up both the cost profile and the sustainability profile you can’t beat evaporation” he said.

Endangered flower

Elsewhere near the Rhyolite Ridge project a species of buckwheat wildflower that grows nowhere else in the world has been recommended for endangered species protection in a yearlong review that will conclude in May. The Center for Biological Diversity sees the plant threatened by ioneer’s lithium project. A year ago conservationists alleged that “someone” had destroyed more than half of the plants at the site; an investigation by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determined that the plants had been eaten by rodents.

Conservationists say the flower will be wiped out by the proposed mine; ioneer counters the bigger threat to the flower is climate change itself and maintains that the rare flower and mine can co-exist with conservation efforts and compaby-supported research on finding new environments for the plant.

There lies the quandary as state geologist James Faulds of the University of Nevada Reno notes. Most people want to “decarbonize our energy grid as much as possible. And that results in some other impacts.” Protecting a rare plant species for example “that’s important. We should worry about that” he said. “But it’s not like we can mine lithium and not have something impacted somewhere.”

What’s more by discouraging or prohibiting mining here potentially shifting it to developing nations with more lax regulation “Then we’re really just saying ‘Well no do this in your backyard right? Because our backyard is more precious.’”

“We have a lot of resources that can help transition our energy away from carbon based fossil fuels” he said at the same time diversifying local and state economies. “Let’s try to promote this take advantage of it and try to mitigate as the impacts as much as possible. There will be impacts but it’ll be a very very small percentage of the land.”

Toyota Sienna minivans will be equipped with Aurora's self-driving system with a test fleet to be deployed by the end of 2021. The plan is to deploy the vehicles some time after that in Uber Technologies' ride-hailing fleet and those of unspecified other companies.

In December Aurora said it was buying Uber's self-driving unit the Advanced Technologies Group (Uber ATG) in a deal valued at US$4 billion (RM16.2 billion) well below ATG's earlier valuation of US$7.25 billion.

Toyota and Denso were investors in Uber ATG along with Japan's SoftBank Group. Toyota was working with Uber ATG to develop a self-driving system to be deployed on the Sienna according to ATG executives.

Aurora's new agreement with Toyota and Denso expands on the earlier collaboration between the two Japanese companies and Uber ATG. Toyota remains an investor in Uber and transferred its equity stake from ATG to Aurora as part of the December transaction according to a source familiar with the deal.

As part of the December transaction involving ATG Uber agreed to invest US$400 million in Aurora in a deal that values Aurora at US$10 billion. The two companies agreed to collaborate on self-driving vehicles for Uber's ride hailing and food delivery networks.

Aurora said it will explore with Denso the mass production of self-driving components and with Toyota the development of mobility services including financing insurance and maintenance.

Aurora also has a deal with heavy-truck maker PACCAR to develop self-driving systems for long-haul freight delivery.

Earlier Aurora had development pacts with Volkswagen and Hyundai Motor.

Good News: This Company Allows All Its 40000 Employees to Work From Home Permanently

Apart from PwC other major accounting firms such as Deloitte and KPMG have also been giving employees more choice to work remotely in the wake of the COVID pandemic.

PwC said its employees who choose to work virtually will have to come to office a maximum of three days a month for in-person appointments.

New Delhi: At a time when several companies are preparing to end the work from home culture and start work from office soon here is a firm which has introduced a new policy to allow its employees to work from home for lifetime. Yes you heard it right. Accounting and consulting firm PwC this week announced that it will allow its 40000 US client services employees to work virtually and live anywhere they want in perpetuity to embrace permanent remote work.

Apart from PwC other major accounting firms such as Deloitte and KPMG have also been giving employees more choice to work remotely in the wake of the COVID pandemic.

Speaking to Reuters PwC’s deputy people leader Yolanda Seals-Coffield said the firm was the first in its industry to make full-time virtual work available to client services employees. As per update the firm’s support staff and employees in areas such as human resources and legal operations that do not face clients directly have the option to work virtually full-time.

Giving further details Seals-Coffield said that PwC employees who choose to work virtually will have to come to office a maximum of three days a month for in-person appointments such as critical team meetings client visits and learning sessions.

Saying that the location matters for PwC employees’ pay Seals-Coffield said the employees who opt to work virtually full-time from a lower-cost location would see their pay decrease.

It must be noted that Alphabet Inc’s Google also determined the employees’ pay based on their location with those who work from home permanently potentially earning less.

However PwC said the partners at the firm whose team members choose to be in the office regularly will not be allowed to work completely remotely.

It must be noted that PwC is globally headquartered in London and its US head office is located in New York. In a statement the firm in June said all of its 20000 employees in Britain would be allowed to choose in the future whether they work from home or not.

They had moved from one retirement home into another during the last week such places were open the week before Covid-19 lockdowns began.

Pandemic restrictions kept my parents and their fellow residents and millions of others globally locked indoors for months without outside visitors. Much of that time was spent in their rooms alone seeing staff for basic care temperature checks and food drop-offs whenever the building was coping with an outbreak. And outbreaks happened repeatedly. One two-week isolation period would roll into another when a new case developed resetting the countdown clock. Though I could see how there were few other options my heart still broke for my parents quarantined and separated from each other eating solo meals and spending long days alone.

However my sorrow was somewhat tempered with the help of technology. My sister and I had used some of our last pre-pandemic visit with our parents to set up Amazon Echo Shows in each of their new rooms. I had been using an Echo to help close the gap between New York where I live and Ontario Canada where they are for a few years. Since the pandemic began however the Echo Show has been more than a convenient way to check in with them or say goodnight. It has allowed me to track their moods and any visible changes in their health and to lift their spirits with music or with TV shows that we could watch together if I pointed my Echo at my laptop screen.

Plenty of families kept in touch over Zoom and FaceTime calls as the pandemic continued. But to contact people who aren’t comfortable with computers or smartphones have mobility issues or some form of cognitive decline like dementia (which is the case for my parents) video calls usually required a third person to manage the software hold the iPad or grab the phone when it rang. Virtual visits had to be scheduled and were often limited to once or twice a week for 30 minutes.

Echo Shows however have a “drop-in” function that can in a sense teleport me into my parents’ room without needing them to fiddle with the technology or without even asking them to physically move closer to the machine. For my pandemic virtual visits I didn’t have to bother overworked caregivers and ask them to spend 30 minutes hovering over someone who could make them sick or whom they could sicken. Nor did I have to wait for days to see them and watch the clock as we spoke.

If I appreciated the Echo Shows before Covid I now believe the devices—or any similar technology with that same drop-in feature—belong inside every retirement and nursing home. Like telephones they ought to be ubiquitous.

The case for equipping seniors’ homes with cameras

I understand how that kind of endorsement of AI-enabled technology owned by one of the world’s most powerful omnipresent companies might not sit comfortably with everyone. My husband like most people I know finds Echo Shows or any other always-listening device to be “creepy.” Fortunately you don’t have to own an Echo Show to talk to one; there’s also a phone app. Users also decide who has “drop-in” privileges. Still cameras and smart devices are famously relatively easy to hack and this technology is far from innocuous.

But anyone in my position would understand why I accept this arrangement: I feed personal info to a data-gobbling tech giant that wants to sell me things and in exchange I get this fairly seamless gateway into my parents’ lives. I see it as a variation on what we all do every day with our phones and laptops. And when you’re aware of how lonely your elderly parents can become and what that loneliness does to their physical and mental health their memory and general quality of life you decide to trust pledges about privacy and data anonymization.

Amazon has taken the lead with products created for an aging population

Amazon is banking on similar perhaps begrudging acceptance from customers as populations age in developed countries. This week it announced a new suite of products a few of which were designed to various degrees with aging seniors in mind. The new Alexa Together eldercare subscription service for example allows seniors to contact emergency services through their Alexa devices at home making it an update on established medical alert systems. But it’s also set up so that family and other loved ones can track a person’s activities during the day with their permission and cue reminders for medications remotely.

The Echo Show meanwhile will soon be available with a 15-inch screen (for $250) that you can mount on a wall. It will have picture-in-picture capabilities and can double as a television creating a kind of entertainment hub crossed with a wall calendar and digital photo frame.

Stealing the spotlight however was the Astro an entry-level “household robot” that is being likened to an Echo Show riding a Roomba. To some that sounds ridiculous and too invasive. The robot’s design undoubtedly falls flat (and apparently early adopters will need to be patient according to Vice) but my guess is Amazon wasn’t looking to compete with Apple or Samsung for choosy younger millennial buyers in this case.

The Amazon Astro household robot could be useful for senior care too

Among the customers who might appreciate the Astro are people who currently wish they could be a few places at once—parents watching kids at home during the workday for example or busy adults with a parent who lives alone across town on the other coast or overseas. (The Astro can be set to recognize household occupants and then patrol the house like a terrier alerting owners about strangers which raises new privacy questions to be sure.)

It’s easy to imagine how the Astro which will sell for $1000 to $1450 later this year and the Alexa Together service would work in tandem to help older people achieve what they care about most: avoiding institutions for as long as possible. Many seniors don’t need 24-hour care but their memory may be slipping enough or their gait so unsteady that their children or friends will find themselves looking for ways to keep tabs on them from a distance. There’s only so much a single device in the kitchen or bedroom can do. Plus a robot doesn’t have to sleep.

These new products emphasize physical safety more than virtual companionship but they will offer both. The timing is right: the pandemic has shown us the value of digital products that most closely replicate in-person visits. I find the minimalism of the Echo Show compared to a Zoom call or other software makes it far less draining for daily use. The sense of being in the same room is so real to my mother that she will try to pass me things like magazines or banana bread through the screen. She laughs at herself when I remind her that it’s a computer not a window.

The case for equipping seniors’ homes with cameras

Scheduled visits at actual windows became commonplace for older people in care facilities in 2020. But inside the buildings were quiet.

Data from Safegraph which collects anonymous cell phone activity to measure things like foot traffic to businesses show that compared to early January 2020 total visits to nursing and assisted living homes across the US was significantly lower during the first year of the pandemic.

The reduction in visitors was even more dramatic at facilities in counties close to urban centers. Each line below is foot traffic to nursing homes and assisted living facilities in the US’s most populated 35 counties. These countries represent a quarter of the US population. While the national average never fell more than 34% from January levels many of the largest counties saw visits drop more than 50%.

By the April 2021 the vast majority of seniors and many people in the general population were vaccinated and visits to retirement and nursing homes rebounded. However with the Delta variant still spreading and because breakthrough cases are most dangerous to the elderly and immunocompromised lockdowns have not entirely ended for many nursing homes.

For that reason I still tell people about Echo Shows if they have family in congregate living situations or single parents living alone at home. I explain how the drop-in feature works both ways: The video isn’t clear right away giving users including professional caregivers time to hang up or turn off their camera if it’s not a good time for a video call. I walk people through their options for configuring a device and how to talk to the staff at a retirement home so that they’ll know the camera is not there to surveil—and thereby demoralize—workers. The Echo is not hidden it doesn’t record anything and its chimes make it extremely obvious when a call is arriving.

Using it has allowed my sister and me to become friendlier with the staff caring for our parents. There was one case early in the pandemic when I chose to complain about an otherwise wonderful caregiver whom I twice saw not wearing a mask. It turned out this person didn’t entirely believe that Covid was real. I would not have known any of this without Echo.

The more typical fear for families was that their loved ones would be neglected in the pandemic a reasonable consideration given the unprecedented situation staffing shortages and the rare but disturbing stories surfacing of residents left to fend for themselves and people dying of hunger or dehydration in addition to Covid-19.

Even in the best of times families provide a critical layer of oversight (and extra help with personal grooming and housekeeping) within nursing homes. That was partly why a few advocacy groups like Families for Better Care in Austin Texas raised money to send dozens of Echos to families in need.

“We were toying around with the idea and looking at different devices because we were thinking that this is probably going to mushroom into a much larger lockdown” says Brian Lee executive director. His team settled on the Echo Show because of its “drop-in” feature and he says families wrote to him to say it has been a lifeline mostly to maintain a connection that was richer than a phone call.

Leaving someone with not enough contact was no small risk. During the pandemic “social isolation” was named as a cause of death among seniors in Minnesota and “failure to thrive” became the euphemism in other places.

Technology will keep us connected in good times and bad

Having easy video access to my parents through the worst part of the pandemic was an admittedly mixed blessing giving me a front-row seat to their sadness and frustration but also to moments of levity.

I was online often when a wave of Covid swept through their memory care unit. When my mother tested positive I learned about it from an on-site nurse who crouched down close to the Echo one evening to share the information as gently as possible. Then my father tested positive too and I watched anxiously on and off for days as they separately reached points in the disease when they stopped eating and could only sleep and it wasn’t clear whether recovery or hospice care would come next.

I was also able to log on one afternoon just a few weeks later when I knew they would be getting their first vaccination shots. They were reunited by this time and allowed to quarantine together when the public health nurses arrived in full PPE regalia. As my mother and father now recovered from the virus got their first doses of the vaccine I kept talking telling them that they had nothing to fear from the lovely people under all that plastic.

My guess is that most people would want to have the same privilege particularly those who come from cultures that still value intergenerational living arrangements but don’t have the right living space or the types of jobs that make it feasible.

Amazon is getting out ahead of other mainstream tech companies by paying attention to the many millions of people who caregiving for an adult in some way. Even before the deadly coronavirus arrived at a senior living facility in Washington state marking a major inflection point in the pandemic for Americans more seniors homes were introducing Alexa technology into their suites. The mission was not humanitarian but rather part of a push at Amazon to embed Alexa technology into all kinds of real estate.

“With Alexa Smart Properties we are providing Alexa experiences at scale in properties such as hotels vacation rentals apartments senior living and more” Nicolas Maynard senior manager of Alexa for Everyone at Amazon told me via email. “We continue to hear from some of the largest senior living providers in the US that integrations like these would be useful for their communities.”

The flood of AI tools ready to inundate our lives will deserve scrutiny and public attention. Determining how and when technology can appropriately assist seniors—and others who need monitoring—when the caregiving sector as a whole faces chronic and severe labor crunches is going to be an ongoing discussion.

Obviously technology alone won’t solve the larger structural issues that lead to social isolation for adults after retirement—and robots (as well as animatronics for dementia patients) while useful as watchful entertaining assistants can’t entirely replace warm embraces or breaking banana bread together. To fix this will require building new ways of working and new ways of raising families that allow people to care for aging parents. It also will require a broad rethinking of the value of human caregivers who need higher wages and a different standing in society if they are to do this work in sufficient numbers and with sufficient skills to satisfy the coming crush of demand. For now I’m grateful that a few brilliant engineers are solving issues for families doing their best within the systems we have.

More tips for using an Amazon Echo Show with someone in a nursing home

⚖️ On Amazon’s Echo forums customers often share stories of a nursing or retirement home staff refusing to allow Echos in a room because it makes the staff anxious or it’s seen as a privacy issue when someone has a roommate. Although rules may vary by state most care homes will see the Echo as a way to fulfill a resident’s right to visitations. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services even authorized the use of public funds for nursing homes to buy things like webcams and iPads for this purpose during the pandemic. It might be necessary to point out that the Echo doesn’t record video. And you may need to hang a notice in the resident’s room so caregivers will be aware of the device.

📲 During setup you’ll need a way to accept a confirmation code. If you or your aging loved one doesn’t have a mobile phone you will need to either configure the Echo with your own phone number (and use the Alexa app on your phone to drop in on the device) or temporarily acquire a second line which you can do through various apps.

🔍 Study all the settings carefully. Consider turning off permissions to shop on Amazon through the Echo Show. You should also be able to turn off advertisements for Amazon products and services or other unsolicited announcements.

📣 You can delete voice recordings in the Echo’s history too.

But not often do the prominent players the authors and publishers put their words into action and take a stand against the tide.

This month Dave Eggers the award-winning campaigning author is to risk American sales of his new novel The Every by limiting access to the hardback copies. Only small bookstores will stock it.

It is a typical move for Eggers who has long pushed back against the conventions of the industry setting up his own non-profit publishing house McSweeney’s in 1998 two years before his breakout bestseller A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. But it is also something that fits neatly with the subject of his new book. A sequel to his 2013 hit The Circle it is a dystopian satire featuring a company that looks much like Amazon.

For the US release of the book on Tuesday Eggers will allow hardcover editions to go on sale only in small bookstores. Weeks later Vintage a division of Random House will publish an e-book and a paperback version. Even then customers won’t be able to buy the hardcover on Amazon.

Eggers’s maverick move has been met with great gratitude by America’s independent bookstore owners who are struggling with the huge post-Covid shift to online services.

“It’s made us feel like the author and the publishing industry really care about the smaller stores” said Laura Scott Schaefer owner of Scattered Books in Chappaqua New York. “It’s been hard to compete with the bigger retailers. Any small advantage we can get in any kind of space is great.”

Mitchell Kaplan owner of Books & Books in Miami and creator of the Miami book fair international goes further. He believes Eggers is recognising “the important role independent booksellers play in the ecology of our literary culture”. Kaplan sees Eggers’s innovation as support for stores more than an attack on Amazon which after all has had a negative impact on a wide range of other small businesses. The larger question for Kaplan is what would be lost if independent bookshops disappeared.

“You’d be losing a diversity of voices when you lose a diversity of sellers. The people who sell literature in a community help people to discover voices that might not otherwise be introduced” he said.

In Britain where Eggers’s publication day will be like any other retailers are calling out for a similar champion. And many authors will be rallying to the cause on Saturday Bookshop Day by attending live events in local bookshops. Leading writers Jeanette Winterson Ian Rankin Mark O’Connell Val McDermid KN Chimbiri and Piers Torday are among those giving book signings or readings on 9 October.

The grassroots pushback against the dominance of online bookselling has three main prongs in the UK. The first is the growing solidarity between independent bookshops across the nations typified by the arrival a year ago of uk.bookshop.org a portal for buying books that pays back to booksellers that are not part of large chains. In 12 months the site has been joined by 480 independent bookshops generating £1.6m for them.

Nicole Vanderbilt the managing director of the British site said championing the independent bookshop was “vital” work. “They are a fundamental part of their local communities often offering so much more than simply being a place to buy books. We’re proud to be a place online that offers a glimpse of that expert bookseller touch but more importantly allows customers to support indies.”

The second response to online dominance is a campaign to persuade Amazon to let its staff join a union improve their conditions and so level the playing field. It is led by the union Unite which has also published a report into Amazon’s business strategies and set up a confidential whistleblowing hotline for workers. “We are calling on Amazon to back a declaration which guarantees workers have the freedom to talk with and form a union without fear across the UK and Ireland” a Unite spokesperson said this weekend. Callers to the hotline Unite claims have spoken of stress ill health and the daily indignities of a “toxic” working culture.

The third element of the grassroots movement is taking place on high streets. Taking their cue from campaigners such as Eggers who set up reading venues on America’s west coast many bookstores are now venues for events and community groups. In the aftermath of the lockdown the bookshop appears to have become more of a focal point for many people.

“It’s been very clear that everyone is enjoying the experience of browsing of getting recommendations from the team here and of attending our author events once again” said Sheryl Shurville owner of Chorleywood Bookshop in Hertfordshire and Gerrards Cross Books Buckinghamshire. “All our customers have been incredibly supportive over the last 18 months but it is great to get some form of normality as we head towards Bookshop Day and the busiest time of the year for bookshops.”

On Saturday Ann Cleeves the bestselling author of the Shetland Vera and Two Rivers novels will be signing copies at her local bookshop The Bound in Whitley Bay Northumberland while Melissa Cummings-Quarry and Natalie A Carter authors of Grown: The Black Girls’ Guide to Glowing Up will be attending an event at the newly opened Bookhaus Bristol. The founders of Black Girls’ Book Club will be sharing stories and advice from 4pm. While in Seaton Devon the Owl and Pyramid Bookshop is to host a series of events including a book treasure hunt for children.

Author Graeme Macrae Burnet will be conducting a mystery drop-in tour of bookshops in the north of England starting at The Book Case Hebden Bridge to sign copies of his book Case Study; and in Rotherham from Tuesday Typeset a new community bookshop and co-working space is handing out £5 vouchers to five winners of a daily competition for customers who arrive with a five-line poem.

In Eggers’s new book Mae Holland the protagonist of The Circle has become the villainous executive of a company that takes over a rival with a familiar-sounding founder who “was only too happy to cash out and devote his time to space exploration with his fourth spouse”. But for the writer the narrative is more than a chance to poke fun at Jeff Bezos. Eggers is highlighting the huge shift towards online technology in our lives.

“I don’t think most people necessarily realise just how much an inhibiting species change this is – this overwhelming constant unavoidable surveillance” he said recently adding “and it’s making us a far less interesting species and far more subservient to technology.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9hbWF6b24tYXN0cm8tc3VydmVpbGxhbmNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon's Astro robot uses fear to get into your home,"The future of home robotics wasn’t supposed to be this dumb. We were promised K-9 companions Baymax best mates tiny droids with built-in projectors and nights out with Bender the ultimate party robot. Instead we got several different incarnations of vacuum and self-driving cars that can’t drive themselves. Elon Musk’s latest creation wishes it was sophisticated as the robotic Richard Simmons from The Simpsons.

Now we have Astro a three-wheeled robot that’s less android buddy more RoboCop if he ran the local neighbourhood watch.

The Astro announced on Tuesday is billed as a convenience tool a robot butler that according to its own advert will be used to check if the hob has been left on and lets users video call grandparents. It moves at one metre per second detects movement wherever it patrols and can be linked to a Ring home security system.

It can care for the elderly says Amazon’s hardware chief Dave Limp. It can be steered via your phone allowing the owner to peer through its camera like a periscope. Through its facial recognition software it can detect intruders it doesn’t recognise (which may come with some depressingly predictable problems). It’s also kind of cute a rectangular headed puppy that stares up at its owner with glowing Wall-E eyes.

Alongside Astro Amazon also announced a flurry of new smart gadgets designed to invite Bezos’s company further into the family home. There’s a £45 Alexa-compatible thermostat an interactive tablet for kids and a £60 Fitbit rival watch. All are controlled using the Alexa assistant.

Robots aren’t all stupid. They provide jobs for paralysed individuals in Japanese cafés. They could help children with autism improve their social skills. Robot puppies do flips which is nothing if not novel and only in rare cases do they lash out and attack the elderly.

Many social robots such as the ElliQ ‘aging-sidekick’ Jibo and the Paroseal a £5000 pet-therapy robotic purring fuzzball serve seemingly good purposes but have failed to make any sizable impact. Amazon meanwhile sold 1.4 million Ring doorbells in 2020 alone and has signed agreements with more than 2000 US police and fire departments. Indeed Alexa is now available in more than 80 countries.

In the domestic robot market the sheer size of Amazon means it has a better chance of succeeding where others have failed. But where other robots offer clever little companions for lonely grandparents or fluffy seals for children to cuddle Amazon’s message is clear: ”You want to keep your family safe? Our products can help.”

He’s risen rapidly in the organization during the pandemic. I love listening to him because he makes bold claims about the world sometimes not entirely backed by facts or evidence. But he’s never mealy-mouthed in his assessments.

Raja is a very bright guy who may lead an airline himself one day. However every time he speaks I can’t help but feel he has a huge hole in his thinking. He appears to think of the American Airlines product entirely as being about its schedule.

There’s no question that to appeal to customers an airline needs to get them from one place to another . It needs to do so efficiently reliably and safely and at a competitive price . Raja talks regularly about American’s ability to connect passengers through Dallas and Charlotte to get them where they want to go.

In fairness legacy carriers have learned that while non-stop routes used to be their cash cows those often have ultra low cost carrier competition. So yields in and out of small cities are often better.

But Delta can connect passengers well through Atlanta and also through Detroit and Minneapolis (though not only) United can connect passengers through Houston and Chicago (for instance) and Southwest Airlines carries more domestic passengers than any other airline.

In the latest Airlines Confidential podcast the tendency to focus on the schedule and not even mention the passenger experience at the airport on board planes and with employees is evident throughout. Here’s a key statement that lays out the airline’s vision coming out of the pandemic

We must come out of here with something where we have the very very best product for our customers. That means we have to have the most comprehensive network the biggest depth of schedule the most breadth of schedule a loyalty program that makes it easy for them to fly us and get rewarded on us.

The way American is doing this is shifting its partnership strategy away from long haul carriers (they’ve focused on airlines like British Airways Japan Airlines and Qantas in the past but have pivoted to add Alaska Airlines JetBlue Jetsmart Gol and Indigo).

These partnerships are about the network which is the product.

We need to make it so a customer would willing choose AA plus for example JetBlue over any of our competitors on a totally organic network. And the more and more we can do that they get their loyalty benefits they get their corporate deal they get all of that stuff the more real the strength and product potency of this network is.

Brian Znotins American’s Vice President of Scheduling who works for Vasu described the airline’s challenge with international flying from Los Angeles as in essence that they make money when they fly routes without competition but where they’re head-to-head with other carriers those carriers win business on customer experience.

It’s striking that you do not hear any reference from Raja when he speaks to the airline’s official brand purpose of “caring for people on life’s journey.” There’s nothing about customer-centric policies or experience. It’s important to understand that the schedule is the product.

The only hint that Vasu sees product mattering is in his discussion of putting widebody aircraft onto domestic and short haul international flights out of Miami which were historically narrowbody markets and finding that customers went out of their way to fly these – mentioning “flat beds” – and this allowed them to “stop competing on price.” So they plan to also “continue to upgauge the [Miami] hub” but that means “continuing to do what we do which is have 321s and 737s there” as well as “bolster the connectivity of the hub.” Is an Oasis first class seat with less legroom the same thing as a flat bed?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTEwLTAzL2RlbHRhLXRvLXJhbXAtdXAtYm9zdG9uLXNlcnZpY2UtYWRkLW5ldy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXJvdXRlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta (DAL) to Add International Flights From Boston,"Delta Air Lines Inc. will increase service from Boston adding two international destinations and boosting capacity about 24% over its previous peak to better compete against an American Airlines Group Inc .-JetBlue Airways Corp. alliance that unifies the airport’s top two carriers.

2 long-hauls go up against AA's NYC expansion

Next summer travelers headed to or from Boston Logan Airport (BOS) will enjoy new Delta nonstop service to Athens (ATH) and Tel Aviv (TLV) with flights commencing on May 27 2022 and May 26 2022 respectively according to Cirium schedules.

Both flights will operate three times per week aboard the Airbus A330 aircraft. Athens will be served by the -300 variant while Tel Aviv will be flown by one of Delta's newest widebodies the A330-900neo.

The A330-900neo offers Delta's top onboard experience with 29 Delta One Suites in the pointy end of the plane 28 Premium Select recliners 56 extra-legroom Comfort+ seats and 168 standard coach ones.

The A330-300 is currently undergoing a retrofit program to add a premium economy cabin though the aircraft's reverse herringbone biz cabin isn't as modern as the A330neo.

Adding Athens and Tel Aviv brings Delta to nine long-haul destinations from Boston. The airline is already flying to Amsterdam and Rome and is slated to resume (the temporarily suspended) service to Dublin Edinburgh Lisbon London and Paris in the coming months.

While the new routes are welcome news for Boston-based travelers adding Athens and Tel Aviv likely isn't a coincidence.

When American Airlines and JetBlue unveiled their Northeast Alliance in July 2020 the two airlines promised plenty of growth in New York and Boston. While the two carriers have since launched a slew of new routes American started two new high-profile destinations from New York-JFK as well to — you guessed it — Athens and Tel Aviv.

Delta already goes head-to-head against American on both JFK to Athens and Tel Aviv and now it seems to be one-upping the Northeast Alliance with service to both cities from Boston.

A domestic boost with 3 new routes

Delta is also doubling down on its domestic network from Boston with the introduction of three new routes on July 11 2022 to Baltimore (BWI) Denver (DEN) and San Diego (SAN).

Delta Connection partner Republic Airline will fly a 76-seat Embraer 175 to Baltimore five times a day. Once-daily service to Denver and San Diego will be operated by a Boeing 737 Cirium schedules show.

In addition to these three new markets Delta is still on track to move forward with its previously announced plans to add service to Charlotte (CLT) and Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) — two of American Airlines' largest hubs — on Oct. 10.

As you might've expected JetBlue already operates flights to all three of Delta's new domestic destinations from Boston.

Boston gets a big plane upgrade

Delta isn't just adding a bunch of new Boston routes. It's also seemingly committed to sending its fanciest jets to the city as well giving flyers another reason to choose the airline over its competitors.

For long-haul flights Delta has prioritized Boston as one of the first markets to receive its recently retrofitted jets. Last week the carrier scheduled the first two routes with its revamped Boeing 767-300 and now the retrofitted A330s are finding a home in Boston as well.

Plus with the A330neo serving Tel Aviv it'll mark the introduction of the airline's well-regarded Delta One Suites cabin to the city.

The Northeast Alliance actually spurs competition

Last month the Department of Justice filed an anti-trust lawsuit against the Northeast Alliance between American and JetBlue saying that the pact allows for anti-competitive coordination between the two carriers.

The two airlines quickly responded striking back against the DOJ with plenty of statistics new marketing campaigns and even a dedicated website neaflies.com to prove that the Northeast Alliance does in fact promote competition and deliver benefit to customers.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

The Northeast Alliance has already provoked a competitive response from Delta in recent months with a four-route expansion from Boston and New York along with a lie-flat Boeing 757 upgague on premium transcontinental routes.

Delta's latest move however is its most comprehensive response yet.

Without the Northeast Alliance it's anyone's guess if Delta would've followed through with this massive Boston expansion. One thing is clear though: With new routes larger planes and more frequencies travelers headed to or from Boston are the big winners."

In fact the U.S. endures more blackouts than any other developed nation. According to federal databases at the Department of Energy (DOE) and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) the number of U.S. outages lasting more than an hour has increased steadily over the past decade.

With this in mind it’s no surprise that a growing number of Americans are seeking reliable electrical supply. For contractors and construction professionals this means both residential and commercial customers will be interested in learning about their backup power options — which is why it’s important to be well-versed in reliable portable and efficient backup power fuels.

Propane has become increasingly popular because of the advantages it offers. Most notably propane backup power provides affordable resilience for everyone: homeowners businesses commercial building owners and operators and more.

How do grid failures and power outages affect commercial customers?

An interruption to power can take its toll on a business including loss in productivity sales and product as well as brand damage and safety issues. According to data from the DOE power outages can cost businesses as much as $150 billion per year. Whether voluntarily or based on code requirements many commercial buildings are incorporating backup power systems to avoid these costly challenges.

S&C Electric Company surveyed facility and energy managers of commercial and industrial businesses across the U.S. in 2018 and found that productivity loss and delays within service deliveries and production were the top two problems faced by businesses as a result of power outages. The same study found that around 82% of all businesses experience an outage at least every two years and 24% of respondents experience an outage once a month or more.

How do grid failures and power outages affect residential customers?

Eaton’s Blackout Tracker Annual Report looks at the scope and severity of power outages across the country. According to its 2017 report 36.7 million people were affected by 3526 power outages and the average power outage lasted approximately 81 minutes. Recently the devastating weather in Texas left millions without heat water or electricity for several days during freezing temperatures. Additionally over one million people were without power and air conditioning following hurricane Ida in Louisiana and California’s rolling blackouts and wildfires create significant challenges for homeowners on a regular basis.

Power outages can impact a variety of systems in the home including smoke and fire alarms refrigeration units heating and cooling systems health and safety equipment and many other applications. Helping customers select reliable backup power allows them to avoid unplanned power outages continue operating appliances in their home and ultimately save money and stress. This is especially important for customers who rely on electricity to power medical equipment or work from home and need uninterrupted power.

The reliability and versatility of propane power generation

The staggering statistics outlined above reinforce the need for reliable affordable power in residential and commercial projects. Everyone needs to be able to bounce back. Fortunately propane offers scalability and performance to power any size of project or business.

Whether used for towable and portable power on construction sites prime power generation in businesses or standby power in a home propane offers reliable power and versatility. And with a propane backup generator construction professionals can give customers more than just nonstop power — they can provide affordable peace-of-mind too.

When it comes to selecting a backup power fuel propane offers benefits. For example propane’s has an indefinite shelf life and can be stored for extremely long periods without degrading.

Propane tanks can provide scalable on-site storage for backup power systems of any size. On-site fuel storage is an important consideration and can help ensure that the generator is ready to operate and won’t be subject to upstream fuel reliability issues.

Surprising to some propane offers more environmental protection compared with other options. Propane burns clean reducing nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions particulate matter and CO2 emissions. According to data from the DOE propane produces 16% fewer carbon emissions per unit of energy compared with diesel. Propane is also non-toxic non-poisonous and won’t contaminate soil or water.

Because of propane’s energy versatility it can power many other major energy systems and appliances throughout a home or building too. In fact residential and commercial customers can attain whole-building standby protection at an affordable price by combining a propane generator with a suite of propane appliances that operate full time including space heating water heating cooking fireplaces clothes dryers and outdoor amenities. Plus having propane appliances throughout a building can actually reduce its reliance on standby power oftentimes allowing customers to downsize to a smaller more affordable backup unit to power lighting and ventilation fans.

And of course the power grid.

Getting power where it needs to go

You can can watch our full 'Energizing Texas' special here

We’re taking a look at energy in Texas from the largest urban solar farm being built in Houston to a road trip in an electric car . We’re also looking at the power grid and the issues we faced during our winter storm. Politicians made efforts to fix the problems but is it enough?

Exactly what the changes will look like just like the other energy reforms will take time. Lake hopes to have a detailed plan by the end of the year.

Chairman Lake is pledging to redesign the entire electricity market from scratch. He said the aim of the overall is to pay companies for reliable and consistent power not just in crisis mode.

“And that’s why we’ve got to get away with it” Lake said. “Private companies can only generate revenue as Texas gets closer and closer to the edge. And that's as you said that is not a good way to run a reliable grid.”

Lake conceded the description is not comforting in the business of reliability.

At a July 13 hearing of the Texas Senate Business and Commerce Committee PUC Chairman Lake called the ERCOT market design a “crisis-based business model.”

The ERCOT market hinges on what’s known as scarcity pricing. Energy prices shoot up only when power becomes more scarce and reserves run low—sometimes dangerously low—like during extreme weather.

“So if revenues don’t cover cost they’re not being made to reinvest. Reinvesting would mean keeping the equipment ready to go.”

“For 8 of the last 10 years in ERCOT the Independent Market Monitors’ report  so that’s a referee the scorekeeper … has pointed out that revenues have not covered cost” Hirs said.

The players or power generators bid to sell their electricity on the ERCOT grid and that competition often means low prices and low revenues.

“The analogy I use is that of the Astros” Hirs said. “In an electricity-only market only those ten guys taking the field tonight are going to get paid. The guys on the bench they don’t get a check.”

He said the problem lies in the very way the ERCOT market is designed. Power generators generally get paid only for the electricity they produce not to be on “standby” or paid for mere capacity to produce power.

“You don't run a multi-billion dollar process day by day by skydiving not knowing if your parachutes are going to open” Hirs said. “This is not the way a grid is supposed to be managed.”

The analogy is troubling to Ed Hirs a University of Houston energy fellow and KHOU’s energy analyst.

“Every morning we're skydiving and you only get one chance for it to go wrong” Chairman Peter Lake said at a June 17 open meeting.

While Texans wait for change EROCT still has to keep the lights on every day. That involves a daunting balancing act—how to match power supply with demand. The newly-appointed chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission likened it to jumping out of a plane.

“It’s not going to happen overnight you’re right about that” said State Senator Charles Schwertner a Republican who authored the weatherization bill. “But we are well on our way to addressing the concerns that Texans had and the failures really that we saw here in Texas."".

Consider the timeline for winterization of energy equipment. Under the newly-passed Senate Bill 3 the Texas Public Utilities Commission has until December to write the rules on how power generators must winterize. For natural gas facilities considered critical to keeping those generators online the Texas Railroad Commission has until March 2023 to write new rules. Once the new standards are in place the new legislation does not specify how long facilities have to comply.

“It’s got to be an urgent matter and it’s not as I talk to you today.”

That is where Texans stands—restoring grid reliability and regaining the public’s trust. Whitmire believes it’s all taking too long.

“If they're warning us in June after the legislature just met … I don't know how the public would have confidence in us” Whitmire said.

The juxtaposition of the two events is a red flag for democrat State Senator John Whitmire.

Just six days later the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ERCOT was asking Texans to conserve electricity concerned there wouldn’t be enough to go around.

“Everything that needed to be done was done to fix the power grid in Texas” Abbott said at the June 8 signing of Senate Bill 2 and Senate Bill 3.

If there is a starting point a kickoff for the future of Texas power it came at the state capitol on a Tuesday in June. With the stroke of pen Governor Greg Abbott ceremoniously inked his signature and proudly declared that power grid reform had become law.

The roadmap did not offer further details on that process or a timeline for when changes might happen but last week ERCOT did come up with a plan to ease congestion in the Rio Grande Valley.It would involve building 350 miles of new high-voltage transmission lines with a 1.2-billion-dollar price tag. The project would take until the year 2027 to complete.

In July ERCOT issued a 60-point roadmap to improving grid reliability . One of the action items is to “initiate a process both at ERCOT and the PUC to address the Lower Rio Grande Valley transmission limitations up to and including the construction of new transmission capacity.”

“First you have to get a problem then you can maybe get a solution.”\

“Given that everything is kind of reactive in the ERCOT market the way it's designed the solutions don't come before the problems” Miller said.

She said the other part of the problem is there’s been no proactive way to fix it.

“That’s part of the problem” said Alex Miller senior commercial transmission and analytics manager for EDF Renewables North America.

The solution seems obvious-build more transmission lines. But that is expensive and takes time. Between lengthy regulatory approvals and construction a high voltage line can take six years to get off the ground. A wind or solar farm can be up and running in less than two.

“Simply similar to if you have too many Christmas lights together you're going to have a problem you’ll blow a fuse eventually.”

“We have to manage all of the transmission lines to make sure that we're not overloading any line” said ERCOT interim CEO Brad Jones.

On some of the electricity highways the constraint is severe. EDF Renewables said the export transmission line out of the Rio Grande Valley is rated to handle 6000 megawatts but ERCOT has throttled back the allowable traffic down to 650 megawatts.

“And it's billions of dollars last year it was one $1.4 billion” Bivens said. “They’ll eventually end up in retail rates.”

Bivens said on the other side of the constraint or bottleneck power becomes more scare and scarcity in the competitive Texas market drives up prices.

“When you have to tell them that they can't generate as much because there's transmission problems you're losing some of the benefit of those low-cost resources” she said.

Bivens is vice president at Potomac Economics the Independent Market Monitor over ERCOT.

ERCOT has put such a block known as a generic transmission constraint on 16 transmission lines across the state. Seven of those are in the Rio Grand Valley. Behind the bottlenecks electricity mostly cheap wind and solar power is essentially trapped.

“Additional megawatts of generation were available but could not be delivered because over 90 percent of the highway was blocked” Temple said.

The company told state lawmakers that frustration happened during the February winter storm when millions of Texans were left in the cold and dark for days. Jay Temple regional senior direct for asset optimization testified February 26 hearing before the Senate Business and Commerce Committee.

“And those are really frustrating days” she said.

In other words you could have a windy day at Las Mojadas but look up a couple hundred feet and the turbines won’t be spinning.

“If there isn't that highway space available for us to move that energy effectively and efficiently then we actually have to tell the turbines to stop stop generating” Fink said.

Fink oversees the company’s Las Mojadas wind farm near Harlingen. The 125 turbine facility can generate enough electricity to power 77000 homes. But on nearby transmission lines there’s often a roadblock of sorts to get it all there. Think of those lines as electricity highways that can safely handle only so many cars. When they get congested with power generators trying to get on the grid operator ERCOT much like a traffic cop limits or constrains the amount of traffic (electrons) flowing on the road.

“It's really frustrating to see that we have the capability to produce more power than we're actually able to get to the people who need it” said Jenny Fink asset manager at EDF Renewables North America.

But it’s not just getting produced.

Another challenge for the future of the Texas power grid is getting power where it needs to go. In the Panhandle West Texas and the Rio Grand Valley towering wind turbines have sprouted up everywhere making Texas the number one wind-power producing state in the nation.

Getting power where it needs to go

The biggest challenge is how long grid-scale batteries can last. Currently the storage limit is four to six hours. The holy grail in the energy world is to develop a battery that can store and discharge power for days.

“And then during the afternoon hours of say 3pm to 6pm when electricity demand peaks they discharge power back into the grid.”

“Like the middle of the night when we're not using that much power those batteries get charged up” Skelly said.

Battery storage is not only “hybrid” or paired with wind and solar farms developers are building “stand alone” projects. They buy power directly from the grid when prices are low then store and sell it back to the grid when prices are high.

“That's exactly why you're seeing more storage is because the cost is really a fraction of what it was just five years ago” Skelly said.

“The cost of storage is coming down dramatically because we all use I-phones or starting to drive electric cars and that drives down the cost of batteries” said Michael Skelly a longtime Texas renewable energy businessman and currently the CEO of Grid United.

There was hardly any battery storage in Texas just a few years ago. In 2019 there was only 104 megawatts in the entire grid. By 2022 it’s estimated to hit 2831 megawatts. The increase was spurred by technology improvements and falling prices.

“The battery storage can supply that energy until those generators can come back online.”

“Battery storage can bridge the gap when other generators go down” Bixler said.

The project can store and discharge 50 megawatts of electricity enough to power more than 10000 homes. It’s a boost of juice available when the ERCOT grid is running low.

“When they're fully charged it will take about an hour and a half to totally discharge all the energy onto the grid” said operations and maintenance site manager Alfonso Reyes.

The thousands of solar arrays are connected to two dozen storage containers each with about 500 lithium-ion batteries inside.

“This plant can deploy energy at any given time of day not just when the sun is shining”

Enel is part of the changing landscape of the Texas power grid. In rural Kaufman County southeast of Dallas its 1400-acre solar far not only harnesses the sun’s energy but stores it too.

“Battery storage is something that is going to be a game changer” said Clark Bixler senior development manager for Enel Green Power.

But the issue of intermittency has one promising solution.

While mother nature can make cheap and clean electricity she doesn’t come with a switch we can control. The sun doesn’t always shine and the wind doesn’t always blow.

Groundbreaking for the Southern Cross Transmission line is approximately two years away and construction is expected to take an additional three years according to Pattern Energy.

“It's hard to just say there's one single thing that's going to solve this but Southern Cross this transmission project can be one of the key things that can help us solve this” Kottler said.

While two gigawatts of additional electricity would not have solved the massive failures of the February storm it could have powered a few hundred thousand homes and bought the Texas grid some breathing room.

“This transmission line can help to keep the lights on by sending power in times of need” said Cary Kottler vice president of North American development for Pattern Energy.

Pattern Energy emphasized the company is funding the project and not looking to Texas residents to pay for the cost. Instead Southern Cross will work similar to a toll road where power generators on either side can pay to move and sell power.

“Just having our independence that way is a big identity for Texas” he said.

“I’d rather keep it in Texas and fix what we have” said Paul Raack.

“Y’all need to get this line through here to make sure we don't lose power again during a snow apocalypse bring it on” said Henderson native Cliff Wilson.

Some residents there have mixed feelings about the project.

The order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gives Pattern Energy clearance to build the 400-mile high voltage direct current line from Mississippi to the Texas-Louisiana border. It would connect to the ERCOT grid another 35 miles east in Rusk County near the town of Henderson.

“Pattern and Southern Cross were able to thread the needle of the federal requirements in order to get that order” he said.

“Congress has set a very narrow path a road map for how you can do an interconnection between ERCOT and a non-ERCOT region” said attorney and Pattern Energy lobbyist Michael Jewell.

Pattern Energy has spent a decade trying to change that with a two gigawatt transmission line called Southern Cross. The project will connect Texas to states in the southeast and the company said it will do so without jeopardizing the independence of ERCOT.

Texas’ energy independence what many call a “go-it-alone” approach dates back to when Franklin Delano Roosevelt was president. Congress passed a law to regulate interstate electricity but Texas utilities choose to keep power within state lines. It shaped the nation’s power grid system as it looks today. The Western interconnect grid and Eastern interconnect grid are regulated by the feds but the ERCOT-operated Texas grid is not. It’s been described as an electrical island. Except for a few small connections or tie-ins it’s largely isolated from neighbors and outside help.

It’s not that neighboring grids didn’t want to offer assistance. They couldn’t. They’re not connected to the ERCOT power gird.

At the peak of the February artic freeze when 51 gigawatts of unavailable electricity left millions in the dark and cold Texas was not able to get much help from neighbors.

“A community that has been held down for generations all of a sudden will be transformed and revitalized” said Turner. “If it can be done in Sunnyside it can be done in other communities as well.”

It’s a game changing green project fueling Sunnyside’s next chapter. Construction is slated to begin before the end of 2022.

“Even beyond the solar farm I can envision the investments taking place around it” said Turner.

Most significant building out the solar farm will lead to new job training opportunities and hundreds of new jobs.

But longtime Sunnyside residents are hoping the biggest transformation is seen and felt in their on backyard.

“This would be quite significant and transformative in nature” said Turner.

The city of Houston known for having one of the highest number of greenhouse gas emitters suddenly through this solar farm alone will be able to offset 120 million pounds of CO2 per year.

“The impact is not just felt here locally the impact would be global in scale” said Turner.

Tens of thousands of solar panels will line an area the size of 200 football fields and produce enough energy to power 5000 homes. That means discounted power rates for Sunnyside residents.

“You’re talking about the largest urban solar farm in the country” said Wolfe.

The project will make history. It’s all part of the city’s Climate Action Plan and Mayor Turner’s Complete Communities Initiative.

Wolfe says Sunnyside Energy will lease the former dump site from the city and transform it into a stunning array of solar panels.

“There’s no better use for a former landfill than putting solar on it” said Dori Wolfe co-developer of the Sunnyside Solar Project.

The former landfill will soon be home to a 240-acre urban solar farm.

“Sunnyside is ignored no more they’re on the radar” said Turner.

Now Turner says that is all about to change.

“For 50 years you have this large contaminated space in your community that has been pulling down your community” said Mayor Sylvester Turner.

The dump has been shut down for decades now it’s just hundreds of acres of overgrown trees.

“Oh most certainly it was an eyesore” said Evans-Shabazz. “I wouldn’t think I’d feel valued if you put a landfill next to my home.”

Evans-Shabazz remembers driving by it as a little girl with her dad.

It was reality from 1937 to the mid 70s. Sunnyside was where the city dumped its garbage.

“I could stand in my yard and see the clouds coming out of it” said Cloud. “It smelled like old rotten meat rotten wood. It was horrible. Just horrible.”

For nearly three decades she lived in the shadow of a city landfill.

“I’ve been here for a while yes” said Cloud. “The dump was right over here.”

Few people know Sunnyside like 100 year old Miss Deatrice Cloud.

If you want to check out green electricity plans in your zip code go to www.powertochoose.org and scroll to the renewable energy section. A search for the cheapest options shows a renewable plan is about a penny and a half more per kilowatt hour.

Marinov believes going green sends a message about wanting more renewable energy in Texas.

That accounting mechanism is called “renewable energy credit.” When you purchase a plan your provider buys credits equal to the amount of power you use. The alternative energy power plants get those credits when their green energy is added to the grid. The buying and trading of credits happens at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas better known as ERCOT.

“What happens is your electricity company keeps track of where that power comes from and makes sure that if they’re selling you 100% renewable power” he said. “The way that renewable energy works is through an accounting mechanism.”

Even with a renewable plan the electricity fed into your home is the same mix everyone gets from the grid. What you’re paying for is to have more green energy produced in Texas along with a guarantee of sorts.

But here’s something you should know.

“The going thing about Texas is that it’s a competitive electricity market” he said. “You can choose your provider and you can choose what goes into your plan.”

But going green at home doesn’t require a big investment or adding anything to your home. Daniel Richmond is with Green Mountain Energy. His company offers environmentally friendly plans.

“I’m not skimping at all” he said. “We keep it at the same temperature throughout the year.”

Which is also why Marinov switched from a traditional electricity plan to a renewable one.

“I am very environmentally conscious” he said.

On top of this house on the west side of Houston you’ll find solar panels. Inside the 1500 square foot home you’ll find a very happy Bobby Marinov.

Driving electric in Houston : Get plugged in

By Tiffany Craig

When I got the assignment to test drive an electric car I was a little nervous. Houston traffic is already tricky but now I had to navigate through freeways in a vehicle that’s powered by a battery.

We rented a Kia Niro EV. The starting price is just under $40000 and can get about 240 miles on a charge. Kelley Blue Book calls the Niro a good first electric car because it’s a small and practical electric crossover.

As we start the trip we wondered how many EVs are out here. The Texas Department of Motor Vehicles shows 36418 EVs were registered in 2020. State officials expect that number to climb to 3.3 million in the next twelve years.

Are we ready for that?

Chuck Crews from Baytown says yes.

“Just wait” he said from behind the wheel of his Tesla Model Y. “I remember feeling exactly the same way when I saw the very first iPhones.”

Crews was an early investor in Tesla and bought his Model Y in the summer of 2020. The nearest charging station from his home is 10 miles and nothing about it feels inconvenient.

“The first folks who said my horse can eat grass anywhere now you’re telling me I have to go and fill up my car with gasoline. Similarly it’s learning there are charging stations I’m going to need to go here” he said.

Right now Tesla is the only company with its own nationwide network of superchargers. We met Crews at a charging station. It takes much longer to charge than to fill up with gas.

“Typically we’re here about 20 minutes for a charge” he said. “I’ve spent as long as 40 45 minutes.”

The charging network will expand to other EVs at some point in time this year. A tweet from Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk confirmed that news in July.

Having lots of charging station across the state is key to the future of electric driving in Texas. That’s why we’re talking to Tom “Smitty” Smith. He’s an environmentalist and the Executive Director of the Texas Electric Transportation Resources Alliance.

“What we have today are a lot of charging stations in almost every metro area” Smitty said. “Beyond that it gets kind of thin.”

To create a seamless network “Smitty” wants the state to build 75 charging stations to make traveling across Texas easier. He believes those extra stations will convince more Texans to switch to electric.

“This is an evolutionary market” he said. “We’re trying to get things in place before the big boom really begins to hit in about 2025.”

With more automakers getting into the EV market batteries will get better and go farther before needing to be charged.

We also talked to Ramanan Krishnamoorti the Chief Energy Officer at the University of Houston.

He says the building the battery for an EV leaves a larger carbon footprint than manufacturing a traditional vehicle. Over time that flip flops.

“About a year and a half out you’ve come to the point where those two are equivalent in the amount of environmental harm they do” said Krishnamoorti. “After 18 months an electric vehicle actually benefits the environment.”

We also asked about where the power comes from at charging stations.

“It comes from exactly where your household and your work get electricity” he said.

Currently in Texas energy comes mostly from natural gas wind and coal. The rest is generated from nuclear and solar.

“As we start to make our grid more renewable friendly we’re going to start seeing less and less of a carbon footprint associated with EVs” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvd2VyLWVuZy5jb20vb24tc2l0ZS1wb3dlci9zY2huZWlkZXItYmxhY2stdmVhdGNoLWNvbXBsZXRlLW1hcmluZS1haXItc3RhdGlvbi1taWNyb2dyaWQtcHJvamVjdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Schneider Black & Veatch complete Marine Air Station microgrid project,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.power-eng.com/on-site-power/schneider-black-veatch-complete-marine-air-station-microgrid-project/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvd2VyLWVuZy5jb20vb24tc2l0ZS1wb3dlci9zY2huZWlkZXItYmxhY2stdmVhdGNoLWNvbXBsZXRlLW1hcmluZS1haXItc3RhdGlvbi1taWNyb2dyaWQtcHJvamVjdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMS8xMC8wMi9pLXNwZW50LW9uZS13ZWVrLWRyaXZpbmctdGhlLXZ3LWlkLTQtaGVyZXMtaG93LWl0LXdlbnQtc3BvbnNvcmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I spent one week driving the VW ID.4 – here's how it went [sponsored],"Volkswagen partnered with Electrek to test the ID.4 electric crossover for a week. During the development release and launch we’ve covered the ID.4 with great anticipation.

For this sponsored partner post I test out the ID.4 as a daily driver and road-trip vehicle taking notice of the comfort utility and light off-road capabilities.



The ID.4 takes a more traditional approach to the compact SUV. Volkswagen made the right choice by making an SUV that appeals not just to early adopters and statement makers but also to the average driver who is ready to go electric. With a spacious cargo area utility features and traditional design the ID.4 doesn’t feel like a quirky EV with a catfish front end.



After personally driving a variety of EVs for some years (including the aforementioned catfish) the normalcy of the ID.4 was a welcome change.

There and back again

To put the ID.4 crossover through its paces I took it on a couple family trips.

The two major trips originated in Salt Lake City. The first was north to the Spiral Jetty. The locally famed man-made art formation is off a dirt road located approximately 50 miles from the nearest small town. The next trip was to a natural formation called The Little Grand Canyon. This sandstone and river wonder is about 40 miles away from electricity or running water and is almost entirely dirt roads.

ID.4 controls

The ID.4 controls felt easy to use and had even more to explore as the week passed. One example is the regenerative braking mode. In regular drive mode the car accelerated and braked with predictable expectations. Putting the car into braking mode the regenerative braking would activate upon releasing the throttle an easy way to save a bit more energy on every trip.

The regen-braking mode isn’t aggressive. Some electric cars will come to a complete stop with the release of the throttle pedal a feature called “one foot driving.” VW opted for the car to stop with a press of the brake pedal quite the novel idea. 😉

Segment of the Little Grand Canyon

ID.4 range

The range on the ID.4 was fantastic. The official EPA range of the Pro S model I drove is 250 miles but there’s more to my story. I had the opportunity to test it out on several trips of over 100 miles one way. The first trip was planned carefully (and initiated cautiously) but as it turns out the caution was unnecessary. The ID.4 easily beat the expectations I had even driving on canyon roads in the summer heat. I can personally say that I would easily commit to longer trips trips with no hesitation.

Volkswagen is partnering with their sister company Electrify America to offer new ID.4 buyers three years of unlimited charging on their nationwide network. This is no small feat since the network covers all major highways and smaller places are being included on a regular basis. If Electrify America has stations in Spanish Fork and Brigham City Utah there’s a good chance you’ll be covered too.

ID.4 off-road

Driving the ID.4 off-road was loads of fun. Rattling on the dirt roads the steering remained tight and responsive and the higher clearance and visibility came in handy for surprises in the terrain. I rode for about 120 miles off-road and enjoyed the capability and security of the vehicle’s design. I was impressed by what this two-wheel drive version could do and the upcoming 4WD opens up even more possibilities.

More trunk space compared to other electric crossovers

As a daily driver the ID.4 felt right at home. The cargo capacity made trips to the store or carrying sports equipment a breeze. The rear hatch opens wide with the press of a button the flick of a switch or a wave of the foot under the rear bumper. With a hands-free opening it literally opens up to a myriad of utility options.

The rear cargo area has a tall profile making larger items fit in and out very easily. The contrast to this can be seen on other EV crossovers where the rear hatch holds a more aerodynamic shape. Aerodynamics are nice but if the ID.4 already impressed me with real-world range then I’m very happy to have the extra space along with it.

Sleek interior comfortable controls

ID.4 interior

My 4-year-old daughter absolutely loved the ID.4. She mostly spent her time climbing between the back seat and the trunk in the driveway but when we got moving she was mesmerized by the wide-open glass roof. She was in a carseat but if she was older she would no doubt love the large rear seating. The wide-open rear seat is not obstructed by a transmission tunnel making the middle seat actually usable by an adult.

The ID.4 features a landscape main display with most of the controls accessible through its touchscreen. Along with this quick controls are found on a variety of tailored buttons for different functions. The windows and wipers are tactile. The audio and cruise controls feel like rocker switches. The climate controls are quasi-touch screen and of course the main touchscreen itself controls much more. The longer I used the different buttons the easier it became to hit them without a second thought.

Dadicus Major (in natural environment)

ID.4 active cruise control

The touchscreen and climate controls became second nature quickly. Dual climate controls customizable mood lighting phone connectivity and map navigation are all seamless. One aspect that took some getting used to was the Active Cruise Control. Once engaged the car seemingly drove itself along the freeway steering braking and accelerating. I prodded the wheel to let it know I was diligently paying attention and I was. I was a bit squeamish about letting the car drive itself so after about 30 miles I took back control. Maybe after another week I would really come to love it but I’m not embarrassed to admit I was still intimidated by the new technology.

Electrek’s Take

Overall I think the ID.4 is the most intuitive electric car I’ve ever driven. It’s not trying to be something it’s not or promise anything spacey or out of this world. It’s a well-grounded feature-rich electric SUV with an approachable entry and plenty of depth to explore. Volkswagen’s tag line for the ID.4 is an electric car “for the millions not the millionaires.” I’m sure a millionaire would like it too but in my case VW hit its mark.

View the current offers here.

Four statement credits. $900 in potential value.

Earlier this year The Platinum Card® from American Express saw a major refresh which included a plethora of new perks -- and an increase to the card's annual fee to $695 (see rates and fees). However upon taking a closer look at some of these new benefits it's pretty easy to see they're not designed with every cardmember in mind.

One of the least useful — and most disappointing — new credits is Amex's digital entertainment credit (enrollment required).

From limited eligible merchants to the constraints of a monthly subscription here is why Amex should consider restructuring its new credit for Amex Platinum members.

My expectations were too high

When I first heard rumblings that the Amex Platinum might add a ""digital entertainment credit"" earlier this year I was excited about this permanent benefit.

For context from May through December 2020 during the height of the pandemic Amex offered a temporary streaming credit of up to $20 per month (since expired) with the Amex Platinum Card. That particular streaming credit offered up to $20 per month for eight months worth up to $160. The eligible services included:

Amazon Music Unlimited Apple Music Apple TV+ AT&T TV Now Audible CBS All Access Disney+ ESPN+ Fubo TV HBO Max HBO Now Hulu iHeartRadio Kindle Unlimited Luminary MLB.TV NBA League Pass Netflix NHL.TV Pandora Peacock Prime Video Showtime Sling TV SiriusXM Streaming and Satellite Spotify Stitcher TIDAL Music YouTube Music Premium YouTube Premium YouTube TV

Unfortunately as we now know this year's permanent digital entertainment credit is much more limited.

Limited eligible merchants

By its very nature a digital entertainment credit should be well open to all forms of personal digital entertainment. But Amex restricts this credit to just four merchants:

Peacock

Audible

SiriusXM

The New York Times

Not only is it extremely restrictive to offer a mere four eligible partners but these also aren't even very popular services in the overall digital entertainment sphere. That alone probably limits their usefulness for many cardmembers.

Constraints of a monthly credit

The other main issue is that a monthly credit may not align with how some of these subscription services operate and charge their customers.

Here's an example. Amex provides this credit on a monthly cadence which means annual subscriptions — with pricing that is often cheaper — do not qualify.

(Screenshot courtesy of SiriusXM)

A SiriusXM subscription is much more affordable when purchased at the annual rate compared to month-to-month. While it still may make sense to go for the monthly rate to utilize the Platinum entertainment credit this isn't helpful for someone that is already locked into an annual (or even bi-annual) contract.

In addition a monthly statement credit may not align with how a company such as The New York Times bills customers. Since the Times bills subscribers every 28 days this could mean two purchases falling within the same month.

Tip: Try to avoid getting a new Times subscription at the end of the month if you're trying to use the entertainment credit. For instance if your first Times subscription hits your Amex Platinum account on October 1 you'll be billed for the next subscription on October 29.

'Bundled' subscriptions don't count

Many consumers don't have the time or bandwidth to manage multiple subscriptions.

Therefore they may purchase a bundled subscription to make things easier (or more affordable). Unfortunately these don't count as part of the Amex Platinum's digital entertainment credit.

For Peacock ""eligible purchases do not include subscriptions bundled with cable services or other bundles."" For SiriusXM ""eligible purchases do not include any transactions involving SiriusXM's Stitcher or Pandora services.""

Bottom line

The Amex Platinum is a card that has a lot going for it including premium travel perks lounge access elite status with hotels and much more.

But the card's digital entertainment credit could certainly use a revamp to be more useful for the average consumer. Besides the obvious lack of eligible services there are some notable downsides to having a monthly credit. At the end of the day I had expectations that were simply too high based on what Amex offered last year (temporarily). Let's hope Amex does more with this perk which has so much potential to expand and improve.

(Update October 2021: Post has been updated to reflect a new public $300 bonus. I posted about a $300 bonus in the past but it ended up being targeted select AmEx business cardholders. This one is open to the public. You must scroll down a bit to see the bonus info screenshot below. Note that you may be asked to provide supplemental business documentation like Articles of Incorporation.)

Updated full review:

Kabbage offers financial solutions for small businesses and was acquired by American Express in late 2020. On top of the very competitive interest rate of 1.10% APY there is currently a public $300 bonus for their business checking account. Here are the highlights:

1.10% APY on balances up to $100000

No monthly maintenance fees.

No minimum balance requirements.

Free ATM access. Check app for a map to the nearest in-network ATM.

Deposit checks for free via mobile app.

Deposit cash at one 90000 participating retailers nationwide (including Walgreens CVS Walmart) for a variable fee up to $4.95. Check app for a map to the nearest location.

Need paper checks? $20 fee for one pack of 100 personal-sized checks.

Looks like if you like doing all your business banking via a mobile app this would be a good fit. If you deal with a lot of physical cash or write a lot of checks… not so much since you would have to pay a fee for each cash deposit and a $20 fee for every 100 checks. However at 1.10% APY and no minimum balance requirement you could just use this as a business savings account.

Other Kabbage products include a business line of credit and a service to send invoices and accept payments. (They also helped dole out a lot of PPP loans.)

Kabbage Checking is provided by Green Dot Bank member FDIC. The routing number may show up as “GoBank A Division of Green Dot Bank.”

This bonus was previously targeted to holders of an American Express business credit card but a representative messaged me and said this one is now fully open to the public.

Bottom line. Kabbage offers a digital-first business checking account that would work well for small businesses that don’t deal with a lot of physical cash deposits or paper checks (due to the fees involved). I get the feeling that it is only a matter of time before this becomes the “American Express business checking account”. Hopefully the interest rate stays high for a while.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZnJlcXVlbnRtaWxlci5jb20vZWFzeS0zMDAtY2hlY2tpbmctYWNjb3VudC1ib251cy13aXRoLWthYmJhZ2UtZm9yLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,(EXPIRED) Easy $300 checking account bonus with Kabbage (for businesses),"Sorry this deal is no longer available.

Quick Thoughts

Stephen Pepper wrote about a similar offer back in July that turned out to be targeted. This time around the offer is public.

The Kabbage account is a great checking account as it earn 1.1% APY on balances up to $100000 which is excellent (in the current environment) for an account with no balance / deposit / merchant services requirements. There are no fees for in-network ATMs and banking services are provided by Green Dot. Funds are FDIC-insured up to $250000.

You will need a business for this account but a sole proprietorship should work just as it does for business credit cards.

Keep in mind that you will very likely receive a 1099-INT for this bonus. Also note the threat terms & conditions line that notes that if they determine that you have engaged in any abuse / misuse of the account that they may close not only your Kabbage account but “any other accounts you may have with us”. The “us” seems to include American Express so tread lightly.

Overall this looks like a great way to pick up $300 — or $600 in two-player mode. Note that previous data points indicate that bonuses are slow to post — the terms say 45 to 90 calendar days from account opening. I’d count on closer to 90 days since I don’t believe bonuses from July have posted yet and it has been about 10 weeks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3NhdnZ5LXNhdHVyZGF5LXVzZS1hbWV4LW9mZmVycy13aXRoLWJ1eWVycy1jbHViL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Savvy Saturday: Earn cash with Amex Offers via a buyers club,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available. View the current offers here.

The Amex Offers program is one of the single greatest card benefits of all time. These are targeted statement credits that trigger when you use your card at select merchants.

Many American Express cards including the The Platinum Card® from American Express American Express® Gold Card and the Delta SkyMiles® Gold American Express Card come with access to Amex Offers. If you have an eligible Amex card you can locate your Amex Offers by logging into your account online then scrolling down to the section where they are displayed.

Amex Offers are uniquely effective because they can help you save money on purchases you'd already planned to make. For example there are sometimes big discounts at certain gas stations and some restaurant chains that you don't have to go out of your way to take advantage of.

But what about those other peripheral offers that you've got no intention of redeeming? You can actually make a bit of money from them if you use the following trick.

The secret: Buyers clubs

A buyers club is a company that pays you to buy products for them. They're willing to reimburse you because they think they can resell those products at a profit. Oftentimes you simply enter the buyers club's address as the shipping address so you don't have to deal with any packages. When they receive the package they'll send your money.

A buyers club may pay you to purchase any variety of things due to changing circumstances. Here are some common examples:

Dell begins taking orders for its latest-generation laptop

An oft out-of-stock item like Apple Airpods suddenly go on sale

The U.S. Mint plans to debut a new gold coin that will sell out quickly

Daily Newsletter Reward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter Join over 700000 readers for breaking news in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG’s experts Email address Sign up By signing up you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy . You may unsubscribe at any time.

You can sign-up for email alerts from buyers clubs and you'll get frequent updates as to what they're currently after. All you then need to do is keep tabs on your Amex Offers so you'll know when a buyers club request intersects with a current offer.

When my Amex Platinum Card offered $100 back on Dell purchases of $500+ I personally had no need for Dell products. I instead purchased a computer for a buyers club and my $100 Dell credit posted within two days. Then the buyers club reimbursed me for the entire purchase within a week netting me $100.

Buyers clubs can also be a great way to meet minimum spending requirements or simply generate a lot of spending on your credit card. Below are a couple fantastic examples of Amex Offers that can be used with a buyers club. These appear on my Marriott Bonvoy Business® American Express® Card:

10% back with Dell up to $1500

Up to 75000 bonus Marriott points after spending $75000

That Dell offer is especially magical. If I manage to send $15000 worth of Dell products to a buyers club I'll end up $1500 richer. That's not completely out of the realm of possibility when computers routinely sell for $500+. You can sometimes even purchase five at a time. Not only that but I could stack it with the offer to earn bonus points and snag an extra 15000 Marriott points worth around another $120 based on TPG's current points valuations.

That's an extraordinary set of potential benefits for a card that incurs a $125 annual fee (see rates and fees).

A few caveats

Before you go charging up a storm just keep a few potential drawbacks in mind.

Orders don't always go through

There are some buyers clubs for which I've personally had a very difficult time making purchases. My guess is that merchants see large quantities of items heading to the same address and they flag the purchase as potentially fraudulent. This can be very frustrating as your order may be canceled. Calling to make the purchase can give you a better shot at a successful order though it's far less convenient.

Pay directly through the merchant

Amex Offers tend to come with lots of terms and conditions including some purchases only being eligible through specific links and having to be made directly through the merchant partner. For example if you were offered $100 back on a Dell purchase you couldn't just purchase a Dell computer through Best Buy. The offer would only trigger when you spend through the Dell website.

Only use trusted buyers clubs

At the end of the day you're also trusting a buyers club with hundreds (or even thousands) of your hard-earned dollars. When you send them a product you have very little recourse if they decide not to pay you. I've never seen this happen but it's still a good idea to research the most reputable buyers clubs before you begin liquidating those hard-to-use Amex Offers. I won't endorse any specific buyers clubs in this post.

Bottom line

The Amex Offers I receive on my American Express cards effortlessly save me $500+ every year on purchases I planned to make anyway. But with a bit of elbow grease I can pretty easily double that thanks to buyers clubs. Strategically redeeming Amex Offers can more than offset all my Amex credit card annual fees each year.

The secret documents expose offshore dealings of the King of Jordan the presidents of Ukraine Kenya and Ecuador the prime minister of the Czech Republic and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The files also detail financial activities of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “unofficial minister of propaganda” and more than 130 billionaires from Russia the United States Turkey and other nations.

The leaked records reveal that many of the power players who could help bring an end to the offshore system instead benefit from it – stashing assets in covert companies and trusts while their governments do little to slow a global stream of illicit money that enriches criminals and impoverishes nations.

Among the hidden treasures revealed in the documents:

A $22 million chateau in the French Riviera – replete with a cinema and two swimming pools – purchased through offshore companies by the Czech Republic’s populist prime minister a billionaire who has railed against the corruption of economic and political elites.

More than $13 million tucked in a secrecy-shaded trust in the Great Plains of the United States by a scion of one of Guatemala’s most powerful families a dynasty that controls a soap and lipsticks conglomerate that’s been accused of harming workers and the earth.

Three beachfront mansions in Malibu purchased through three offshore companies for $68 million by the King of Jordan in the years after Jordanians filled the streets during Arab Spring to protest joblessness and corruption.

The secret records are known as the Pandora Papers.

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists obtained the trove of more than 11.9 million confidential files and led a team of more than 600 journalists from 150 news outlets that spent two years sifting through them tracking down hard-to-find sources and digging into court records and other public documents from dozens of countries.

The leaked records come from 14 offshore services firms from around the world that set up shell companies and other offshore nooks for clients often seeking to keep their financial activities in the shadows. The records include information about the dealings of nearly three times as many current and former country leaders as any previous leak of documents from offshore havens.

In an era of widening authoritarianism and inequality the Pandora Papers investigation provides an unequaled perspective on how money and power operate in the 21st century – and how the rule of law has been bent and broken around the world by a system of financial secrecy enabled by the U.S. and other wealthy nations.

The findings by ICIJ and its media partners spotlight how deeply secretive finance has infiltrated global politics – and offer insights into why governments and global organizations have made little headway in ending offshore financial abuses.

An ICIJ analysis of the secret documents identified 956 companies in offshore havens tied to 336 high-level politicians and public officials including country leaders cabinet ministers ambassadors and others. More than two-thirds of those companies were set up in the British Virgin Islands a jurisdiction long known as a key cog in the offshore system.

At least $11.3 trillion is held “offshore” according to a 2020 study by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Because of the complexity and secrecy of the offshore system it’s not possible to know how much of that wealth is tied to tax evasion and other crimes and how much of it involves funds that come from legitimate sources and have been reported to proper authorities.

Every corner of the world

The Pandora Papers investigation unmasks the covert owners of offshore companies incognito bank accounts private jets yachts mansions even artworks by Picasso Banksy and other masters – providing more information than what’s usually available to law enforcement agencies and cash-strapped governments.

People linked by the secret documents to offshore assets include India’s cricket superstar Sachin Tendulkar pop music diva Shakira supermodel Claudia Schiffer and an Italian mobster known as “Lell the Fat One.”

The mobster Raffaele Amato has been tied to at least a dozen killings. The documents provide details about a shell company registered in the United Kingdom that Amato used to buy land in Spain shortly before fleeing there from Italy to set up his own crime gang. Amato whose history helped inspire the highly praised movie “Gomorrah” is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

Amato’s attorney did not respond to ICIJ’s request for comment.

Tendulkar’s attorney said the cricket player’s investment is legitimate and has been declared to tax authorities. Shakira’s attorney said the singer declared her companies which the attorney said do not provide tax advantages. Schiffer’s representatives said the supermodel correctly pays her taxes in the U.K. where she lives.

In most countries it’s not illegal to have assets offshore or to use shell companies to do business across national borders. Businesspeople who operate internationally say they need offshore companies to conduct their financial affairs.

But these affairs often amount to shifting profits from high-tax countries where they are earned to companies that exist only on paper in low-tax jurisdictions. Using offshore shelters is especially controversial for political figures because they can be used to keep politically unpopular or even illicit activities from public view.

In popular imagination the offshore system is often seen as a far-flung cluster of palm-shaded islands. The Pandora Papers show that the offshore money machine operates in every corner of the planet including the world’s largest democracies. The key players in the system include elite institutions – multinational banks law firms and accounting practices – headquartered in the U.S. and Europe.

A document in the Pandora Papers shows that banks around the world helped their customers set up at least 3926 offshore companies with the assistance of Alemán Cordero Galindo & Lee a Panamanian law firm led by a former ambassador to the U.S. The document shows that the firm – also known as Alcogal – set up at least 312 companies in the British Virgin Islands for clients of the American financial services giant Morgan Stanley.

A Morgan Stanley spokesperson said: “We do not create offshore companies. . . . This process is independent of the firm and at the discretion and direction of the client.”

The Pandora Papers investigation also highlights how Baker McKenzie the largest law firm in the U.S. helped create the modern offshore system and continues to be a mainstay of this shadow economy.

Baker McKenzie and its global affiliates have used their lobbying and legislation-drafting know-how to shape financial laws around the world. They have also profited from work done for people tied to fraud and corruption reporting by ICIJ has found.

The people that the firm has done work for includes Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky who U.S. authorities allege laundered $5.5 billion through a tangle of shell companies purchasing factories and commercial properties across the U.S. heartland.

Baker McKenzie also did work for Jho Low a now-fugitive financier accused by authorities in multiple countries of masterminding the embezzlement of more than $4.5 billion from a Malaysian economic development fund known as 1MDB. ICIJ’s reporting found that Low relied on Baker McKenzie and its affiliates to help him and his associates build a web of companies in Malaysia and Hong Kong. U.S. authorities allege they used some of those companies to shift money looted from 1MDB.

A spokesperson for Baker McKenzie said the firm seeks to provide the best advice to its clients and strives “to ensure that our clients adhere to both the law and best practice.”

The spokesperson didn’t directly address many questions about Baker McKenzie’s role in the offshore economy citing client confidentiality and legal privilege. But he said the firm performs strict background checks on all potential clients.

‘You know who’

The Pandora Papers investigation is larger and more global than even ICIJ’s landmark Panama Papers investigation which rocked the world in 2016 spawning police raids and new laws in dozens of countries and the fall of prime ministers in Iceland and Pakistan.

The Panama Papers came from the files of a single offshore services provider: the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. The Pandora Papers shine a light on a far wider cross-section of the lawyers and middlemen who are at the heart of the offshore industry.

The Pandora Papers provide more than twice as much information about the ownership of offshore companies. In all the new leak of documents reveals the real owners of more than 29000 offshore companies. The owners come from more than 200 countries and territories with the largest contingents from Russia the U.K. Argentina and China.

The 150 news outlets that joined the investigative partnership include The Washington Post the BBC The Guardian Radio France Oštro Croatia the Indian Express Zimbabwe’s The Standard Morocco’s Le Desk and Ecuador’s Diario El Universo.

A global team was needed because the 14 offshore providers that are the sources of the leaked documents are headquartered around the globe from the Caribbean to the Persian Gulf to the South China Sea.

Three of the providers are owned by former senior government officials: a former government minister and presidential adviser in Panama and a former attorney general of Belize who controls two providers.

For a few hundred or a few thousand dollars offshore providers can help clients set up a company whose real owners remain hidden. Or for perhaps $2000 to $25000 they can set up a trust that in some instances allows its beneficiaries to control their money while embracing the legal fiction that they don’t control it – a bit of paper-shuffling creativity that helps shield assets from creditors law enforcement and ex-spouses.

Offshore operatives don’t work in isolation. They partner with other secrecy providers around the globe to create interlocking layers of companies and trusts. The more complex the arrangements the higher the fees – and the more secrecy and protection clients can expect.

The Pandora Papers show that an English accountant in Switzerland worked with lawyers in the British Virgin Islands to help Jordan’s monarch King Abdullah II secretly purchase 14 luxury homes worth more than $106 million in the U.S. and the U.K. The advisers helped him set up at least 36 shell companies from 1995 to 2017.

In 2017 the king bought a $23 million property overlooking a California surfing beach through a company in the BVI. The king paid extra to have another BVI company owned by his Swiss wealth managers act as the “nominee” director for the BVI company that bought the property.

In the offshore world nominee directors are people or companies paid to front for whoever is really behind a company. Application forms sent to clients by Alcogal the law firm working on the king’s behalf say that the use of nominee directors helps “preserve privacy by avoiding the identity of the ultimate principal . . . being publicly accessible.”

In emails offshore advisers used a code name for the king: “You know who.”

U.K. attorneys for the king said that he is not required to pay taxes under Jordanian law and that he has security and privacy reasons to hold property through offshore companies. They said the king has never misused public funds.

The attorneys also said that most of the companies and properties identified by ICIJ have no connection to the king or no longer exist but declined to provide details.

Experts say that as ruler of one of the Middle East’s poorest and most aid-dependent countries the king has reasons to avoid flaunting his wealth.

“If the Jordanian monarch were to display his wealth more publicly it wouldn’t only antagonize his people it would piss off Western donors who have given him money” Annelle Sheline an expert on political authority in the Middle East told ICIJ.

In neighboring Lebanon where similar questions about wealth and poverty have been playing out the Pandora Papers show top political and financial figures have also embraced offshore havens.

They include the current prime minister Najib Mikati and his predecessor Hassan Diab as well as Riad Salameh the governor of Lebanon’s central bank who is under investigation in France for alleged money laundering.

Marwan Kheireddine Lebanon’s former minister of state and the chairman of Al Mawarid Bank also appears in the secret files. In 2019 he scolded former parliamentary colleagues for inaction amid a dire economic crisis. Half the population was living in poverty struggling to find food as grocers and bakeries closed.

“There is tax evasion and the government needs to address that” Kheireddine said.

That same year the Pandora Papers reveal Kheireddine signed documents as owner of a BVI company that owns a $2 million yacht.

Al Mawarid Bank was one of many in the country that restricted customers’ U.S. dollar withdrawals to stem economic panic.

Wafaa Abou Hamdan a 57-year-old widow is among the regular Lebanese who remain angry at their country’s elites. Because of runaway inflation her life savings plummeted from the equivalent of $60000 to less than $5000 she told Daraj an ICIJ media partner.

“All my life’s efforts went in vain. I have been working continuously for the past three decades” she said. “We are still struggling on a daily basis to maintain our living” while “the politicians and the bankers” have “all transferred and invested their money abroad.”

Kheireddine and Diab did not respond to requests for comment. In a written response Salameh said he declares his assets and has complied with reporting obligations under Lebanese law. Mikati’s son Maher said it is common for people in Lebanon to use offshore companies “due to the easy process of incorporation” rather than a desire to evade taxes.

‘Coalition of the corrupt’

Imran Khan was elated when ICIJ’s Panama Papers investigation came out in April 2016.

“The leaks are God-sent” the Pakistani politician and former cricket superstar said.

The Panama Papers revealed that the children of Pakistan’s prime minister at the time Nawaz Sharif had ties to offshore companies. This gave Khan an opening to hammer Sharif his political rival on what Khan described as the “coalition of the corrupt” ravaging Pakistan.

“It is disgusting the way money is plundered in the developing world from people who are already deprived of basic amenities: health education justice and employment” Khan told ICIJ’s partner The Guardian in 2016. “This money is put into offshore accounts or even western countries western banks. The poor get poorer. Poor countries get poorer and rich countries get richer. Offshore accounts protect these crooks.”

Ultimately Pakistan’s top court removed Sharif from office as a result of an inquiry sparked by the Panama Papers. Khan swept in to replace him in the next national election.

ICIJ’s latest investigation the Pandora Papers brings renewed attention to the use of offshore companies by Pakistani political players. This time the offshore holdings of people close to Khan are being disclosed including his finance minister and a top financial backer.

The documents also show that Khan’s water resources minister Chaudhry Moonis Elahi contacted Asiaciti an Singapore-based offshore services provider in 2016 about setting up a trust to invest the profits from a family land deal that had been financed by what the lender later claimed was an illegal loan. The bank told Pakistani authorities that the loan had been approved due to the influence of Elahi’s father a former deputy prime minister.

Asiaciti records say that Elahi backed off from putting money into a trust in Singapore after the provider told him it would report the details to Pakistani tax authorities.

Elahi did not respond to ICIJ’s requests for comment. Hours before the release of Pandora Papers stories a family spokesman told ICIJ media partners that “misleading interpretations and data have been circulated in files for nefarious reasons.” The spokesman added that the family’s assets “are declared as per applicable law.”

Also today a spokesperson for Khan told a press conference that if any of his ministers or advisors had offshore companies “they will have to be held accountable.”

Other political figures have also spoken out against the offshore system while surrounded by appointees and other supporters who have assets stowed offshore. Some who have spoken out have used the system themselves.

“Every public servant’s assets must be declared publicly so that people can question and ask – what is legitimate?” Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta told the BBC in 2018. “If you can’t explain yourself including myself then I have a case to answer.”

The leaked records listed Kenyatta and his mother as beneficiaries of a secretive foundation in Panama. Other family members including his brother and two sisters own five offshore companies with assets worth more than $30 million the records show.

Kenyatta and his family did not reply to requests for comment.

Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis one of his country’s richest men rose to power promising to crack down on tax evasion and corruption. In 2011 as he became more involved in politics Babis told voters that he wanted to create a country “where entrepreneurs will do business and will be happy to pay taxes.”

The leaked records show that in 2009 Babis injected $22 million into a string of shell companies to buy a sprawling property known as Chateau Bigaud in a hilltop village in Mougins France near Cannes.

Babis has not disclosed the shell companies and the chateau in the asset declarations he’s required to file as a public official according to documents obtained by ICIJ’s Czech partner Investigace.cz. In 2018 a real estate conglomerate indirectly owned by Babis quietly bought the Monaco company that owned the chateau.

Babis didn’t respond to requests for comment.

A spokesman for the conglomerate told ICIJ that it complies with the law. He didn’t respond to questions about the acquisition of the chateau.

“Like any other business entity we have the right to protect our trade secrets” the spokesman wrote.

‘A haven of scams’

The secret files provide a layer of behind-the-curtain context to public pronouncements this year about wealth and offshore refuges — as governments around the world struggle with revenue crunches a pandemic climate change and public distrust.

In February a commentary from the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change urged policymakers to seek among other measures higher taxes on land and homes. Blair the institute’s founder and executive chairman talked about how the rich and well-connected shirk paying their share of taxes as far back as 1994 when he campaigned to become the leader of the U.K.’s Labour Party.

“For those who can employ the right accountants the tax system is a haven of scams perks … and profits” he said during a speech in England’s West Midlands. “We should not make our tax rules a playground for …. tax abusers who pay little or nothing while others pay more than their share.”

The Pandora Papers show that in 2017 Blair and his wife Cherie became the owners of a $8.8 million Victorian building by acquiring the British Virgin Islands company that held the property. The London building now hosts Cherie Blair’s law firm.

The records indicate that Cherie Blair and her husband who served as a diplomat in the Middle East after stepping down as prime minister in 2007 bought the offshore company that owned the building from the family of Bahrain’s industry and tourism minister Zayed bin Rashid al-Zayani.

By purchasing the company shares instead of the building the Blairs benefited from a legal arrangement that saved them from having to pay more than $400000 in property taxes.

The Blairs and the al-Zayanis said they didn’t initially know about each other’s involvement in the deal.

Cherie Blair said that her husband was not involved in the transaction and that its purpose was “bringing the company and the building back into the U.K. tax and regulatory regime.”

She also said that she “did not want to be the owner of a BVI company” and that the “seller for their own purposes only wanted to sell the company.” The company is now closed.

Through their lawyer the al-Zayanis said their companies “have complied with all U.K. laws past and present.”

“These are loopholes that are available to wealthy people but not available to others” Robert Palmer executive director of Tax Justice UK told The Guardian. “Politicians need to fix the tax system so that everyone pays their fair share.”

In June Brazil’s economics minister Paulo Guedes proposed a tax reform package that included a 30% tax on profits earned through offshore entities. Experts estimate that Brazil’s richest people hold almost $200 billion in untaxed funds outside the country.

“You cannot be ashamed of being rich” Guedes said. “You have to be ashamed of not paying taxes.”

After bankers and business leaders objected to tax hikes in the legislation Guedes a millionaire former banker agreed to remove the proposed tax on offshore profits. Negotiations over the legislation are continuing.

The Pandora Papers reveal that Guedes created Dreadnoughts International Group in 2014 in the British Virgin Islands.

In response to questions from an ICIJ partner in Brazil Revista Piauí a spokesperson for Guedes said the minister has disclosed the company to Brazilian authorities. The spokesperson did not answer a question about the removal of the offshore tax from the legislation.

‘Pandora’s box’

In December 2018 the Bahamas enacted legislation requiring companies and certain trusts to declare their real owners to a government registry. The island nation was under pressure from larger countries including the U.S. to do more to block tax dodgers and criminals from the financial system.

Some Bahamian politicians opposed the move. They complained the register would discourage Latin American clients from doing business in the Caribbean. “The winners of these new double standards are the U.S. states of Delaware Alaska and South Dakota” one local attorney said.

Months later a confidential document indicated that the family of the Dominican Republic’s former Vice President Carlos Morales Troncoso had abandoned the Bahamas as a go-to sanctuary for their wealth.

For their new refuge they chose a place 1600 miles away: Sioux Falls South Dakota.

The family set up South Dakota trusts leaked records show to lay away various assets including shares they’d held in a Dominican sugar company. The family did not respond to questions about the assets moved from the Bahamas to South Dakota.

The Pandora Papers provide details about tens of millions of dollars moved from offshore havens in the Caribbean and Europe into South Dakota a sparsely populated American state that has become a major destination for foreign assets.

Over the past decade South Dakota Nevada and more than a dozen other U.S. states have transformed themselves into leaders in the business of peddling financial secrecy. Meanwhile most of the policy and law enforcement efforts of the world’s most powerful nations have stayed focused on “traditional” offshore havens such as the Bahamas the Caymans and other island paradises.

The U.S. is one of the biggest players in the offshore world. It is also the country best situated to bring an end to offshore financial abuses thanks to the outsize role it plays in the international banking system. Because of the U.S. dollar’s status as the de facto global currency most international transactions flow in and out of New York-based banking operations.

U.S. authorities have taken action over the past two decades to force banks in Switzerland and other countries to turn over information about Americans with overseas accounts.

But the U.S. is more interested in forcing other countries to share information about Americans banking offshore than in sharing information about money moving through U.S. bank accounts companies and trusts.

The U.S. has refused to join a 2014 agreement supported by more than 100 jurisdictions including the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg that would require American financial institutions to share information they have about foreigners’ assets.

Year after year in South Dakota state lawmakers have approved legislation drafted by trust industry insiders providing more and more protections and other benefits for trust customers in the U.S. and abroad. Customer assets in South Dakota trusts have more than quadrupled over the past decade to $360 billion.

“As a citizen I’m so sad that my state was the state that opened Pandora’s box” Susan Wismer a former lawmaker told ICIJ.

By 2020 17 of the world’s 20 least-restrictive jurisdictions for trusts were American states according to a study by Israeli academic Adam Hofri-Winogradow. In many cases he said U.S. laws have made it more difficult for creditors to put their hands on what they are owed including child support payments from absent parents.

Using documents from the Pandora Papers ICIJ and The Washington Post identified nearly 30 U.S.-based trusts linked to foreigners personally accused of misconduct or whose companies were accused of wrongdoing.

Among them is Federico Kong Vielman whose family is one of Guatemala’s economic powerhouses.

In 2016 Kong Vielman moved $13.5 million into a trust in Sioux Falls. Some of the money came from his family’s company which makes floor waxes and other products.

Guatemalan media reported for decades on the family’s ties to politics. In the 1970s the family was identified as a key ally of Gen. Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio the former Guatemalan dictator known as the “Jackal of Zacapa.” In 2016 the family’s luxury hotel in Guatemala City made a gift of 100 free nights to then-President Jimmy Morales. Guatemalan media outlets reported that a possible payment for “political favors” was suspected.

In 2014 U.S. labor officials filed a complaint against Guatemala’s government that included allegations that the family’s palm oil company underpaid workers and exposed them to toxic chemicals. Company records show Kong Vielman was previously the company’s treasurer.

A year later U.S. environmental authorities providing technical assistance to Guatemala found that the company released pollutants into the Pasion River. The family company Nacional Agro Industrial SA known as Naisa was not charged.

Naisa told ICIJ that it followed the law and did not pollute the river. The labor complaint was resolved by an arbitration panel the company said.

Kong Vielman declined to respond to questions about the South Dakota trust.

Another wealthy Latin American who set up trusts in South Dakota is Guillermo Lasso a banker who was elected as Ecuador’s president in April. Leaked records show that Lasso moved assets into two trusts in South Dakota in December 2017 three months after Ecuador’s parliament passed a law prohibiting public officials from holding assets in tax havens. The records show that Lasso moved two offshore companies to the South Dakota trusts from two secretive foundations in Panama.

Lasso said that his past use of offshore entities was “legal and legitimate.” Lasso said he complies with Ecuadorian law.

Trusts set up in South Dakota and many other U.S. states remain cloaked in secrecy despite enactment this year of the federal Corporate Transparency Act which makes it harder for owners of certain types of companies to hide their identities.

The law is not expected to apply to trusts popular with non-U.S. citizens. Another glaring exemption financial crime experts say is that many lawyers who set up trusts and shell companies have no obligations to examine the sources of their clients’ wealth.

“Clearly the U.S. is a big big loophole in the world” said Yehuda Shaffer former head of the Israeli financial intelligence unit. “The U.S. is criticizing all the rest of the world but in their own backyard this is a very very serious issue.”

‘Extraordinary expenses’

Billionaire Erman Ilicak’s construction empire had a big year in 2014.

The Turkish mogul’s company Rönesans Holding finished building a 1150-room presidential palace for his country’s pugnacious leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan amid media rumblings about cost overruns and corruption and a court order attempting to stop the project.

Another notable event involving the Ilicak family took place in 2014 this time out of the public glare. The corporate titan’s 74-year-old mother Ayse Ilicak became the owner of two offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands according to the Pandora Papers.

Both companies were fronted by nominee directors and nominee shareholders. One of the companies Covar Trading Ltd. held assets from the family’s construction conglomerate the records say. During its first full year in operation Covar Trading earned $105.5 million in income from dividends according to confidential financial statements. The money was stashed in a Swiss account.

It didn’t stay long.

That same year the statements show the company paid almost the entire $105.5 million as a “donation” listed under “extraordinary expenses.” The statements do not describe who or what received the money.

Illiack did not reply to questions for this story.

Ilicak and the other billionaires in the Pandora Papers come from 45 countries with the largest number from Russia (52) Brazil (15) the U.K. (13) and Israel (10).

The American billionaires mentioned in the secret documents include two tech moguls Robert F. Smith and Robert T. Brockman whose trusts have been the targets of investigations by U.S. authorities. Both were clients of CILTrust an offshore provider in Belize operated by Glenn Godfrey a former attorney general of Belize.

Smith agreed last year to pay U.S. authorities $139 million to settle a tax probe and is cooperating with prosecutors. A U.S. grand jury indicted Brockman Smith’s mentor and financial backer in what prosecutors called the biggest tax fraud in U.S. history.

Smith declined to comment. Brockman has pleaded not guilty.

Neither CILTrust nor Godfrey have been accused of wrongdoing. Godfrey did not respond to requests for comment.

A law firm in Cyprus Nicos Chr. Anastasiades and Partners appears in the Pandora Papers as a key offshore go-between for wealthy Russians. The firm retains the name of its founder Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades and the president’s two daughters are partners there.

The records show that in 2015 a compliance manager at the Panama law firm Alcogal found that the Cypriot law firm helped a Russian billionaire and former senator Leonid Lebedev conceal ownership of four companies by listing law firm employees as owners of Lebedev’s entities.

Lebedev – an oil tycoon and movie producer with Hollywood connections – fled Russia in 2016 after authorities accused him of embezzling $220 million from an energy company. Lebedev did not respond to requests for comment. The status of the Russian case is unclear.

The Cypriot law firm also prepared reference letters for Russian steel magnate Alexander Abramov including one drafted days after the U.S. added the billionaire’s name to the list of oligarchs close to President Putin. Abramov didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Theophanis Philippou the law firm’s managing director told the BBC an ICIJ partner that it has never misled authorities or concealed the identity of a company owner. He declined to comment on clients citing attorney-client confidentiality.

Another Russian in the Pandora Papers who has ties to Putin is Konstantin Ernst a television executive and Oscar-nominated producer. He has been called Putin’s top image-maker a creative talent who sold the nation on the idea that the president is “Russia’s strong-willed savior.”

The Pandora Papers reveal that Ernst was given a chance to participate in a lucrative opportunity soon after producing the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics at Sochi creating a spectacle that boosted Putin’s reputation inside and outside the country.

Ernst became a silent partner hidden behind layers of offshore companies in a state-funded privatization contract – a deal to buy dozens of movie theaters and other property from the city of Moscow.

The leaked records show that by 2019 the value of Ernst’s personal stake in the property holdings topped $140 million.

Ernst told ICIJ that he has “never made a secret” of his involvement in the privatization deal and that the deal was not compensation for his work during the 2014 Olympics.

“I haven’t committed any illegal actions” he said. “Nor am I committing any now or about to. This is how my parents raised me.”

‘Our way of life’

As a human rights and anti-poverty activist Mae Buenaventura joined the fight to secure the return of billions of dollars the late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos his family and cronies concealed in Swiss accounts and other hard-to-trace locations.

Many in her home country Buenaventura said “know that the wealthy have ways and means to accumulate riches and also hide them in a way that ordinary people cannot get their hands on.”

The Marcos scandal also educated the world encouraging stepped-up efforts to discover illicit money and punish the people who hide it.

Over the last 20 years political leaders have vowed to “eradicate” tax havens. They’ve called shell companies and money laundering “threats to our security our democracy and our way of life.” They’ve passed new laws and inked international agreements.

But the offshore system is nothing if not adaptable and cross-border financial crime and tax dodging continue to thrive.

When an offshore provider or jurisdiction is exposed by a leak or comes under pressure from authorities others use its misfortune as a marketing opportunity snapping up clients fleeing for safer havens.

An ICIJ analysis identified hundreds of offshore companies that ended relationships with the scandal-tarred law firm Mossack Fonseca after the release of the Panama Papers investigation. Other providers took over as the companies’ offshore agents.

Leak to us

One of those companies was controlled by an offshore trust whose beneficiaries included the wife of Jacob Rees-Mogg a member of the British Conservative Party and current leader of the House of Commons.

The Pandora Papers indicate that a holding company and a trust benefiting his spouse Helena de Chair owned “pictures and paintings” worth $3.5 million.

Another company that moved away from Mossack Fonseca was a BVI entity controlled by the widow and two sons of Indian underworld figure Iqbal Memon. Memon has been identified in news reports as a major drug dealer with links to terrorists. His widow and sons are accused of laundering drug money and have been wanted since 2019 by authorities in New Delhi.

In the Philippines money being moved around in the shadows continues to be a problem despite the attention given to Marcos’ offshore loot. In recent years the U.S. has labeled the Philippines as a “major money laundering jurisdiction.”

Philippine political figures in the Pandora Papers include Juan Andres Donato Bautista. He served from 2010 to 2015 as the chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government – the panel established to track down Marcos’ billions.

A month after he was appointed to lead the commission Bautista created a shell company in the British Virgin Island that held a bank account in Singapore secret records show.

Bautista was later tapped to head the country’s election agency but lawmakers impeached him in 2017 after his wife claimed he’d hoarded millions of dollars in undeclared domestic and foreign accounts.

In a phone call and emails to ICIJ Bautista said he created his BVI company on the advice of bankers. The bank account was opened before he joined the government he said adding that it never received significant deposits and that he disclosed his interests to authorities. He denied wrongdoing and said there are no formal charges against him.

Despite failures by the Philippines and other nations to curb the flow of covert money Buenaventura and other reform advocates say there are reasons for hope.

Street protesters helped topple top leaders in Iceland and Pakistan after the Panama Papers. The Philippines has joined dozens of countries that now require companies to disclose their real owners. Philippine authorities have recovered roughly $4 billion stolen by Marcos and his circle using it to buy land for landless farmers and to compensate families of people targeted for murder or “enforced disappearance” by the Marcos regime.

Many obstacles remain. Big banks law firms and other powerful groups often oppose stronger transparency rules and tougher enforcement against offshore abuses. And in the Philippines and many other countries anti-corruption activists endure legal threats arrests and violence.

Last month police fired water cannons at protesters who marked the 49th anniversary of Marcos’ declaration of martial law by drawing attention to similarities with current President Rodrigo Duterte’s rule.

Buenaventura said she and other grass-roots activists will keep working to expose wealth that’s “deeply hidden.”

“Our slogan is: The truth will come out.”

Despite inhabiting the region dogged by more inequality than anywhere else in the world members of its elite have used a network of trusts shell companies and opaque business records in places such as the British Virgin Islands and Panama to keep a substantial portion of their assets from public scrutiny.

It is a complex obscure corporate web that the publication of the Pandora Papers will put under the spotlight. Obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) the data leak is based on 11.9 million files containing the work of 14 offshore service providers. This body of information has been reviewed and analyzed by a team of 600 journalists with the participation of EL PAÍS and other media giants such as The Washington Post The Guardian and the BBC as well as numerous local media sites.

More information What are the Pandora Papers? Ten key points to explain the investigation into tax havens

While the results of the investigation have a global impact they are particularly earth-shattering in Latin America where around $40 billion (€35 billion) is diverted to tax havens each year. As will be published in the coming days by EL PAÍS and the other media participants of the 35 presidents or former presidents that appear in the documents 14 are from this region. Most are conservative. Among them are three active heads of state who have all been wealthy businessmen: Chile’s Sebastián Piñera Ecuador’s Guillermo Lasso and the Dominican Luis Abinader. Eleven former presidents also appear such as César Gaviria and Andrés Pastrana from Colombia Pedro Pablo Kuczynski of Peru Porfirio Lobo of Honduras Horacio Cartes of Paraguay and Juan Carlos Varela Ricardo Martinelli and Ernesto Pérez Balladares all of Panama.

Regarding the Chilean president whose business dealings involved sectors such as airlines banking and real estate the investigation carried out by Chilean media outlets CIPER and LaBot has exposed a particularly controversial activity among his offshore operations – namely the sale of the environmentally sensitive copper and iron mine Minera Dominga in the British Virgin Islands together with businessman Carlos Alberto Délano one of his childhood friends.

In December 2010 when Piñera had been in the presidential residence La Moneda Palace for just nine months the presidential family sold the business to Délano with a deed signed in Chile for $14 million (€12 million) and another in the Virgin Islands for $138 million (€118 million). The amount was to be paid in three installments with a caveat: the last payment was conditional on there not being environmental protection imposed on the mining operations area as environmental groups were demanding.

The decision on the viability of Minera Dominga was left in the hands of the Piñera government which failed to promote environmental protection so the third installment was finally paid. Despite the lack of transparency the manager of Piñera’s business affairs stated when asked that the president had not managed his own companies for 12 years; that he had been not informed of the process of Minera Dominga’s sale and that the judicial investigation into the operation had been wound up.

Another president featured in the Pandora Papers is the Dominican Luis Abinader whose successful business career was in the hotel sector. The documents link him to two companies in Panama Littlecot Inc. and Padreso SA. Both were created before he took office and were used to manage assets in Dominican Republic. Local media outlet Noticias Sin’s investigation flags up the fact that the shares of these companies were initially “payable to the bearer” an instrument used to hide the beneficial owner of the companies.

A legislative reform in 2018 obliged the Abinader family to publicly register as beneficial owners. Upon becoming president in 2020 Abinader declared nine offshore companies that he controlled through a trust. Both he and Piñera used the Panama-based law firm OMC Group the firm used by Colombian singer Shakira for at least three of the offshore companies the Spanish Treasury has been tracking for years.

The third active head of state who appears in the documents obtained by the ICIJ is Guillermo Lasso a conservative millionaire and former banker who was voted president of Ecuador last year. According to the documents and the investigation carried out by local media site El Universo Lasso ended up operating through 14 offshore companies most of them in Panama closing them only after former left-wing Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa promoted a law banning candidates from being the beneficial owners of companies located in tax havens.

In his defense Lasso claims that he opened these opaque companies because national legislation prevents bankers from investing in his country. He also claims that 10 of these companies are already inactive; he denies any relationship with or profit from the other four.

Lasso was a client of Trident Trust one of the largest providers of offshore entities in the world. This Swiss company is known for its discretion regarding these types of solutions and appears again and again in the operations uncovered by the data leak together with the law firm Alemán Cordero Galindo & Lee (Alcogal) which has a host of clients in Latin America. Alcogal created the majority of the 78 companies used by the Venezuelans accused of hiding $2 billion (€1.75 million) from the state-owned oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) in accounts in Andorra. A significant number of the Chavista hierarchy are among the beneficiaries of this scheme according to Armando.info’s investigation.

In Brazil the Pandora Papers shed light on the activities of the two most powerful men in the country’s economic sector: the economy minister Paulo Guedes and the president of the central bank Roberto Campos Neto. Neither disclosed their offshore activities to the public before assuming positions involving decisions on these types of investments. This possible conflict of interest is particularly pertinent in the case of the economy minister who has pushed through a tax reform to reduce the pressure on private money in tax havens.

Guedes 72 is listed as a shareholder in Dreadnoughts International Group a company registered in the British Virgin Islands. It is what is known in financial jargon as a shelf company: firms that are opened in tax havens but can remain inactive for years waiting for someone to give them a purpose. The documents show that Guedes who is the economic guru of Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro and one of the country’s most controversial figures due to his connections with the financial elite had at least $8 million (€6.89 million) invested in the company in 2014 registered in his name that of his wife Maria Cristina Bolivar Drumond Guedes and that of his daughter Paula Drumond Guedes. In response to the investigation Guedes sent a statement to Piauí magazine pointing out that these activities “were duly declared to the tax authorities and other competent bodies including his participation in the company Dreadnoughts International Group.” The statement also says: “His actions always respected the relevant legislation and were guided by both ethics and responsibility.”

Meanwhile the central bank president Campos Neto owns two companies Cor Assets and ROCN Limited both registered in Panama in partnership with his wife lawyer Adriana Buccolo de Oliveira Campos. The stated purpose of the companies was to invest in financial assets from Santander Private Bank as a member of its executive board. The other opaque companies are Peacock Asset managed by Goldman Sachs and which was discovered in the Bahama Leaks investigation in 2016; and Darling Group a “real-estate management” company.

Like Guedes the central bank president claims that he declared all his money abroad to the Presidency of the Republic’s Ethics Commission as well as to the Brazilian tax authorities and to the central bank itself. He also insists that he has built his “assets with the income acquired from 22 years working in the financial sector.”

Colombia is another Latin American country where a lack of transparency in the financial dealings of the political elite has been particularly extensive. Among the public figures who appear in the leak are two former presidents: the liberal César Gaviria Trujillo who was in office from 1990 to 1994 and the conservative Andrés Pastrana Arango who governed between 1998 and 2002. Both men who retain significant political influence resorted to these obscure corporate vehicles once they had left power.

In Argentina the Pandora Papers shed light on the activities of Jaime Durán Barba a political consultant who catapulted Mauricio Macri to the presidency in 2015; and Zulema Menem daughter of former president Carlos Menem (1989-1999). Also flagged up for murky offshore dealings is the late Daniel Muñoz secretary of former president Néstor Kirchner as well as several key figures that feature in the lawsuit filed for the receipt of alleged illegal commissions paid by public works contractors to Peronist governments.

The results of the investigation in Mexico are significantly more far-reaching with the documents implicating more than 3000 people including three of the richest business tycoons in the country: the mining magnate Germán Larrea the heiress of the Modelo beer group María Asunción Aramburuzabala and Olegario Vázquez Aldir whose group controls private hospitals hotel chains insurance companies and the media. Their combined fortunes amount to more than $30 billion (€25.8 billion).

All three used tax havens to create corporate vehicles through which to operate internationally. Larrea went so far as to open nine companies in the British Virgin Islands between 2013 and 2016 through which he managed the acquisition of luxury real estate in the US leaving scarcely a trace. Aramburuzabala bought million-dollar properties in Utah and New York as well as two private planes. And Vázquez Aldir and his entourage acquired yachts a plane and at least two mansions through eight shell companies. Neither Larrea nor Aramburuzabala have responded to questions from journalists working on the investigation while speaking through a lawyer Vázquez maintains that he complies with all tax and legal obligations both in Mexico and abroad.

A political figure in Mexico whose activities have featured big in the investigation is Julio Scherer Ibarra who was legal advisor to Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador up until a month ago. In 2017 he was listed as the sole owner of a firm based in the British Virgin Islands with assets valued at $2 million (€1.72 million) from his work as a private lawyer. The firm owned a company in the US that had a luxury apartment in an exclusive area of Miami. The business in the Virgin Islands became inactive in 2019 11 months after Scherer joined the Mexican government but the company in the US still owns the Miami apartment. Asked about these activities the former presidential advisor has pointed out that on the dates he made the investments he was not a public official but an independent professional.

The Pandora Papers also show how there was a proliferation of people close to certain centers of Mexican power making intensive use of offshore financial services. This was the case in circles close to former president Enrique Peña Nieto (2012-2018) and also with large suppliers linked to the Mexican public oil company Pemex an energy giant that is currently in debt to the tune of almost $114 billion (€98.14 billion).

Hollywood actor Danny Trejo was making an appearance at the 16th annual Fiestas de las Americas. Northwest Classen High School's JROTC students watched with mouths agape as an icon of their childhood took the stage to the sound of screams and applause.

""He showed me that no matter what I go through or what people say about us the American Hispanic or Latino community that we can always make it"" said JROTC member Perla Torres.

Trejo said he felt at home in Oklahoma City and asked the crowd about the possibility of one of his restaurants opening here to which he was given an enthusiastic ""yes"" through cheers and applause.

Trejo's surprise appearance was an exciting kickoff to a day filled with a parade featuring 60 entries international food merchants touting vibrant wares and plenty of music and dancing from cultures across the Hispanic and Latin American world.

""Fiestas de las Americas is a great time for us to share not only our culture our traditions but also to pass on that tradition to our children"" said Jorge Hernandez spokesperson for the event with Tango PR.

'A lot of hours'

The Fiestas de las Americas has brought together the various Hispanic communities from across Oklahoma City for a day of celebrating National Hispanic Heritage Month every year since 2006 except 2020 due to the pandemic.

The celebration is put on by Calle Dos Cinco in Historic Capitol Hill. Hernandez said this year's festival took six months of planning to make sure everything came together.

""It takes a lot of hours a lot of manpower and a lot of money to make an event like this happen"" Hernandez said. ""We're very grateful to all of our volunteers and all of our sponsors that help make this event great every year.""

Gloria Torres Calle Dos Cinco executive director said the event is completely volunteer-based and that it does well because of the passion and commitment found in those who participate.

Some familiar faces of the area's elected officials were seen at the opening ceremonies and enjoying the festival including state Rep. Mickey Dollens.

Dollens said while his district ends a few blocks from the Capitol Hill area he finds himself there often at the local boxing gym. He said it's important to him to attend cultural events like the Fiestas to foster unity in the community.

""It's what we need (now) more than any time in society"" Dollens said. ""It's become so polarized exasperated by federal politics. When we come together ... it's a message that there's unity ... that at the end of the day we can march in a parade together and come together for constituents.""

'A little bit of everything'

Beyond the center stage where emcees announced parade participants was a variety of food trucks and a bustling mercado. Attendees could be seen enjoying bags of the wheel-shaped chicharrones de harina fried potato chips on a stick fruit cups and more.

Those in the mood for shopping were not disappointed as the vendors had everything from clothing to home decor to puppets most representing a unique Hispanic culture or country.

""You're gonna feel like you've traveled somewhere else but you're right here in the backyard of Oklahoma City"" Hernandez said. ""You have a little bit of everything and from all over Latin America not just Mexico.""

Sisters Lucy Ramos Graciela Perez and Perez's daughter Jacqueline Baten stood under a tent as visitors were attracted by the bright colors of their booth where they sold traje típico or the traditional clothing from Guatemala.

A new business Perez started ""Tipicos Gracy"" around six months ago. The items she sells come from her own family members in different regions around Guatemala and include huipils (tops) cortes (skirts) fajas (belts) as well as magnets and Guatemalan flags.

""I bring this stuff because here (in Oklahoma City) nobody sells (traje tipico)"" Perez said.

Weaving is an important tradition in their culture Perez said and she is happy to share it with others. Tipicos Gracy's items can be found on Facebook and the proceeds support both Perez's family here and those who created the items in Guatemala.

Similar stories and passion for one's heritage could be found throughout the fiestas mercado including at the booth run by De La Tierra Mia which means ""from my land"" owner Carla Romero.

Romero receives her handmade goods — including everything from shoes jewelry accessories and clothing for all ages — from different areas of Mexico.

""The business first started with just jewelry from workers in Mexico and then they soon started adding shoes and shirts and dresses"" said Evelyn Ibañez translating for Romero. ""She started it because she wanted to be able to give people in Mexico a job ... that needed it and something to work for.""

This is Romero's first time selling at the festival but her items can also be found on Facebook and at Old Paris Flea Market."

The U.S. Navy is developing a solar plane that can fly for 90 days while watching military ships below.

Called “Skydweller” after its builder Skydweller Aero the plane is modeled after the Solar Impulse 2 plane which flew around the world in 2015 and 2016. But it has one major upgrade: Skydweller will be pilotless.

The futuristic feature: In the new version of this solar-powered plane the builders will swap out the cockpit for autonomous technology.

“When we remove the cockpit we are enabling true persistence and providing the opportunity to install up to about 400 kilograms of payload capacity” Skydweller CEO Robert Miller told New Scientist.

According to reports the plane’s 72-meter wingspan will carry a long strip of solar panels so that it can stay in the skies for up to 90 days. Skydweller will also use hydrogen fuel cells to boost performance and serve as a backup power source during bad weather. The idea is that the plane will act as a surveillance tool and possibly a communications platform. With long flight times it could keep a watchful eye on ships on patrol.

Cheaper longer missions: Right now the Navy is using drones the size of airliners to monitor vessels at sea. But these drones can only fly for 30 hours at a time reports the U.S. Sun. A lightweight solar-powered plane could expand their capabilities and range.

“The biggest advantage of long endurance is not having to make repeated transits to and from the operating area” Royal United Services Institute’s Justin Bronk told New Scientist.

Skydweller will be able to fly at 100 knots at an altitude of 45931 with up to 800 pounds of surveillance equipment like radar and cameras reports Inceptive Mind.

“For us if you’re flying 90 days with one aircraft that’s two takeoffs and landings versus … hundreds” Skydweller Aero co-founder John Parkes told Aviation Today in June. “Being able to fly thousands of miles persist over an area for 30-60 days and fly back is a differentiator. It’s a huge cost saving to the U.S. government when you look at the whole cost of doing a lot of the national security missions that we have.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzNjZTZiODJhLWJjYmUtNDg3Ni1iNjhlLWE3YzcyZWU0MGQ3ZtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Africa-dedicated private equity firm raises $900m,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

The summer heat waves might be behind us but don’t brush them off just yet. Temperatures are increasing (July 2021 was the hottest month on record) and we can expect it to keep getting hotter. How will we cope besides cranking up the A/C?

People from Ancient Egypt to the Persian Empire have been beating the heat for millennia. And their solution the “wind catcher” could help us once more in our quest for emissions-free cooling.

The problem: It is hot. It is going to get hotter.

87% of all U.S. homes are equipped with air conditioners and air conditioning accounts for 12% of residential energy use. Besides the fossil fuels that power them many use refrigerants to cool the air which can be potent greenhouse gasses if released.

In addition air conditioners cool us down by capturing heat from the interior of buildings but they expel that heat outside directly warming the environment and contributing to the urban heat island effect.

And ironically the warmer it gets the more cool air we blast and the more electricity we consume.

The solution: Innovators are working hard to find ways to cope with the new normal — extreme heat and rising temperatures. The creativity is high from apps that help pedestrians find cool walks and shady spots to next-generation technologies like cooling paper that lowers the temperature inside homes.

Although heatwaves are encroaching on otherwise cool climates there have always been hot places on the planet. And if people live there then they’ve found ways to manage the heat.

In the hot arid Iranian Plateau ancient structures called “wind catchers” are attracting academics engineers and architects who want to find creative new (and old) ways to cool off.

The wind catchers or bâdgir in Persian are common structures that extend above the rooftops in rectangular towers reports BBC. They made life livable. And because they cool a building without using electricity or fuel they are an attractive green solution.

How it works: Wind catchers are tall chimney-like structures that extend from the roof of a building. They harness cool wind and direct it throughout the building.

Wind catchers are designed differently based on the prevailing winds and temperatures in a local region. The most uncomplicated design faces the tower opening toward the prevailing wind to create natural ventilation. But local climates are complicated and often wind catchers had many features: filters passive cooling systems (by passing hot air over cool water) or multiple openings to account for varied wind directions.

Researchers at Weber State University in the United States told Sustainability Times that “these systems were eventually refined to the point that they could at times reach refrigeration temperatures.”

Many things were considered when designing a tower — the layout of the building the addition of internal blades — to optimize how the cool air was drawn into the home and hot air expelled.

Will we resurrect this ancient technology: Parham Kheirkhah Sangdeh a researcher at Ilam University in Iran studies the scientific application and culture of wind catchers in contemporary architecture. He says that pests dust and debris motivated people to stop using traditional wind catchers and adopt Western technology.

“There needs to be some changes in cultural perspectives to use these technologies. People need to keep an eye on the past and understand why energy conservation is important” Kheirkhah Sangdeh told BBC. “It starts with recognising cultural history and the importance of energy conservation.”

But the technology isn’t gone completely.

Free Running Buildings is a start-up creating commercially available products in the U.K. based on ancient wind towers. Their “FREECOOL” technology will top the newly renovated Khalifa International Stadium in Doha Qatar — just in time for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

Ltd. (TSE:4151) today announced that positive data from a Phase 2 study of AMG 451/KHK4083 were presented at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology 30th Virtual Congress on Oct. 2 2021. AMG 451/KHK4083 is a potential first-in-class anti-OX40 fully human monoclonal antibody in development for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.

Kyowa Kirin Logo (PRNewsfoto/Amgen)

The Phase 2 multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial investigated the efficacy and safety of AMG 451/KHK4083 in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who were not adequately controlled with topical agents. The study met the primary objective showing statistically greater improvements from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score at 16 weeks with all four subcutaneous doses of AMG 451/KHK4083 compared with placebo (600 mg every two weeks (Q2W) = -57.4%; 600 mg Q4W = -49.7%; 300 mg Q2W = -61.1%; 150 mg Q4W = -48.3% vs. placebo = -15%; P<0.001).

All treatment groups of patients receiving AMG 451/KHK4083 generally achieved improvements compared to placebo at week 16 for key secondary endpoints such as achieving at least a 75% reduction from baseline in EASI score (EASI-75) an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with at least 2-point reduction from baseline (IGA 0/1) and at least a 4-point reduction from baseline in pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score (PNRS-4). Efficacy measures continued to improve after week 16 for all AMG 451/KHK4083 doses.

The most commonly reported adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of patients were pyrexia nasopharyngitis worsening of atopic dermatitis and chills. The events of pyrexia and chills were mild to moderate in intensity and did not lead to treatment discontinuations.

""The Phase 2 results are both positive and exciting. They show improvement across all 4 dose groups compared to placebo and highlight the potential of OX40 antagonism to help patients"" said the lead investigator of this study Dr. Emma Guttman-Yassky MD./PhD. system chair for the Department of Dermatology and Waldman Professor of Dermatology and Immunology Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Director of the Center for Excellence in Eczema and the Laboratory of Inflammatory Skin Diseases at Mount Sinai. ""I hope that future clinical development data will further elucidate the significance and potential of AMG 451/KHK4083 in the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.""

""We are very pleased to present data from our Phase 2 study assessing the efficacy and safety of AMG 451/KHK4083 in chronic recurrent moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis at the EADV congress"" said Yoshifumi Torii Ph.D. executive officer vice president head of R&D Division of Kyowa Kirin. ""The results show inhibition and deletion of the OX40-expressing cells may provide an important new approach to treating moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis with the potential to help patients maintain responses.""

""Atopic dermatitis affects nearly 30 million people a year and is known to have an extremely negative impact on patients' lives"" said David M. Reese M.D. executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""These data provide strong evidence of the potential of AMG 451/KHK4083 for patients and we look forward to studying this treatment further in Phase 3 clinical trials which we expect to begin in the first half of 2022.""

About the AMG 451/KHK4083 Phase 2 Study

The Phase 2 multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial (NCT03703102) investigated the efficacy and safety of AMG 451/KHK4083 in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who were not adequately controlled with topical agents. The study randomized 274 patients in the U.S. Japan Canada and Germany across four dose-ranging active treatment groups which received subcutaneous AMG 451/KHK4083 (600mg Q2W 600mg Q4W 300mg Q2W 150mg Q4W) and a comparator placebo arm.

The primary endpoint was percentage change from baseline in EASI score at week 16. Additional endpoints include achievement of ≥75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in EASI score IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with ≥ 2 points reduction from baseline and ≥ 4 points reduction from baseline in the pruritus numeric rating scale (NRS) score. Patients in the study were followed up to week 56.

About Atopic Dermatitis

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes excessively dry itchy skin that can be painful. Repeated scratching can cause the skin to thicken harden or become vulnerable to infection. Atopic dermatitis is the most common form of eczema – affecting 1-3% of adults worldwide – and the prevalence is increasing. The disease typically manifests in childhood followed by other allergy symptoms.

About AMG 451/KHK4083

AMG 451/KHK4083 is an anti-OX40 fully human monoclonal antibody engineered with Kyowa Kirin's patented POTELLIGENT® defucosylation technology to enhance its antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity. The initial AMG 451/KHK4083 antibody was discovered in collaboration between Kyowa Kirin US Research and La Jolla Institute for Immunology.

AMG 451/KHK4083 targets and inhibits the activity of the OX40 receptor expressed on the surface of activated effector T-cells and has been shown to enhance the depletion of activated OX40+ T-cells by ADCC. It has been reported that effector T-cells expressing OX40 are present in the lesions of patients with atopic dermatitis and are critical in the disease pathophysiology.

Amgen and Kyowa Kirin Collaboration

On June 1 2021 Amgen and Kyowa Kirin entered into an agreement to jointly develop and commercialize AMG 451/KHK4083. Under the terms of the agreement Amgen will lead the development manufacturing and commercialization for AMG 451/KHK4083 for all markets globally except Japan where Kyowa Kirin will retain all rights. If approved the companies will co-promote the asset in the United States and Kyowa Kirin has opt-in rights to co-promote in certain other markets including Europe and Asia.

Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information future events or otherwise.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly or sometimes even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also we or others could identify safety side effects or manufacturing problems with our products including our devices after they are on the market.

Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products sales growth of recently launched products competition from other products including biosimilars difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers including governments private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore our research testing pricing marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations litigation and product liability claims. In addition our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged invalidated or circumvented by our competitors or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities including in Puerto Rico and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat such as COVID-19 and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities the distribution of our products the commercialization of our product candidates and our clinical trial operations and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development product sales business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products.

Setrusumab an investigational monoclonal antibody that inhibits sclerostin failed to improve radial trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) prespecified as a primary outcome measure in the ASTEROID trial at any of three doses said Suzanne Jan de Beur MD of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore at the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research annual meeting held online and in San Diego.

But the drug did show benefits in other outcomes:

Radial bone strength by micro finite element analysis (co-primary endpoint)

Lumbar spine BMD

Total hip BMD

Femoral neck BMD

Bone turnover markers in serum

Setrusumab also appeared fairly safe in the study with only two serious adverse events potentially related to the agent in the 112 adults treated. One patient suffered an anaphylactic reaction and another experienced headache and hydrocephalus both leading to treatment discontinuation.

Based on these results the drug's co-sponsors London-based Mereo Biopharma and Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical in California plan to pursue ""a comprehensive late-stage program to continue development of UX143 [their codename for setrusumab] in pediatric and young adult patients across OI sub-types I III and IV"" they announced following Jan de Beur's presentation.

Most OI cases are caused by loss-of-function defects in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes that encode type 1 collagen. These can have different clinical presentations and are classified as types I to IV with OI I the mildest and most common type II the most severe type III characterized by very early clinical manifestations (including prenatally) and type IV moderately severe. All types of OI are characterized by weak bone structure and extreme fracture risk hence the informal name of ""brittle bone disease."" The incidence rate is roughly one in 10000 births.

Lacking a specific FDA-approved therapy OI patients are typically treated off-label with bone-building agents such as bisphosphonates or teriparatide. One promising but as-yet-unproven therapeutic target in OI is sclerostin. Inhibiting it in osteoporosis such as with romosozumab (Evenity) leads to both increased bone formation and decreased resorption. Mereo developed its own sclerostin inhibitor setrusumab and saw a commercial opportunity in OI as an orphan disease. It has since received FDA orphan drug designation for setrusumab.

ASTEROID enrolled only adults (ages 18 and over) with types I III or IV although Mereo and Ultragenyx do expect to seek pediatric indications as well. Patients were randomized initially in equal numbers to placebo or three doses of setrusumab (2 8 and 20 mg/kg) given monthly by infusion for 12 months. Partway through however the placebo arm was quietly ended with all patients in that group switched to the 20 mg/kg dose. Mereo never explained the switch nor did Jan de Beur in her presentation which dealt only with the 75 patients randomized to the three active-drug doses who received the full 12 months of treatment.

There was a dose-response relationship of sorts seen for the failed co-primary endpoint radial trabecular BMD. The low-dose group saw a mean decline of 20.0% the mid-dose group a decline of 0.6% and the high-dose group an increase of 0.7%.

Benefits from treatment were much more apparent in the other primary endpoint and secondary outcomes with 20 mg/kg consistently outperforming the lower doses. For example patients receiving this dosage had nearly 9% gain in lumbar spine BMD versus about 6.5% with 8 mg/kg and 2% with 2 mg/kg. A similar pattern was seen for femoral neck BMD; there was no difference between the two higher doses for total hip BMD but the gains were significantly greater than for the lowest dose.

The micro finite element analysis for radial bone a measure of bone strength showed a 3% increase in failure load with the high dose versus about 0.5% increase at 2 mg/kg; results were the same for radius stiffness.

Jan de Beur also said the drug at 20 mg/kg was highly effective in these measures across OI subtypes.

One intriguing finding was that biomarker effects (C-terminal telopeptide and procollagen 2 intact N-terminal propeptide) were relatively short lived peaking in the first month of treatment and then slowly returning to baseline despite continued treatment -- yet BMD increases continued steadily through the full 12 months.

For reasons unknown setrusumab appears to hold a competitive lead for the OI indication. Romosozumab maker Amgen only recently began a phase I trial in children and teens with OI and the literature suggests it hasn't yet become a common drug to use off-label.

Study limitations included the lack of substantive placebo control and the small numbers of patients enrolled.

Neighboring Chatham County courted many of those companies as well as others but none materialized.

Sanford and Lee County won a $200 million Abzena biotech plant in April while Holly Springs and Wake County landed a $550 million Amgen project in August.

It isn’t for a lack of trying. For years Chatham has been the state’s only county with two industrial megasites: the Chatham Advanced Manufacturing site in the western part of the county and Triangle Innovation Point a 2150-acre project on the eastern side near U.S. 1 between Raleigh and Sanford.

Those two developments “put us in the middle of a lot of interesting conversations” says Michael Smith president of Chatham County Economic Development Corp. “The CAM site was one of the final three sites for the Toyota/Mazda project and Tesla looked at the [Triangle Innovation] site. The fact that those projects looked closely at Chatham County [suggests] exciting opportunities are coming for our community.” Toyota/Mazda chose Alabama for a big factory while Tesla picked Austin Texas.

Now Chatham’s strategy has changed for the Triangle Innovation development which was formerly known as the Moncure megasite. Denver-based Kaplan Brokerage Group owns the site with real estate services company JLL handling marketing. Instead of trying for a single big manufacturer they’re envisioning a multiuser campus with sites ranging from 10 acres to 1000 acres says Matt Winters a JLL executive vice president in Raleigh. Life-sciences companies manufacturers and distribution centers are showing interest.

“We are in active negotiations with companies needing 100000 to 1 million square feet of finished building space as well as with potential campus users in need of several hundred acres” Winters says.

The strategy shift creates an advantage for the region says Melissa Smith vice president of business recruitment and development at the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina. “Until it gets further developed it can still be marketed as a megasite but opening it up to the potential for development as a mega-park makes a lot of sense” she says. “[The site] is in play for a number of projects.”

While commercial development lags Chatham has seen dramatic residential growth as the state’s third-fastest growing county over the last decade. It is home to more than 76200 people a 17% increase from 2010. New residents are flocking to areas such as the 1800-acre Briar Chapel neighborhood south of Chapel Hill where 2000 home sites have been under development since 2008. Then there’s the county’s signature community the 7068-acre Chatham Park which broke ground in 2014 with 22000 homes planned over the next 25 years.

While Chatham has been figuring out its future neighboring Lee County has attracted a series of large corporate expansions. “In Lee County we’ve seen the success that comes with good partners planning and figuring out what you want development to look like” Melissa Smith says. That’s now happening at the various industrial parks in Chatham which is “strategically positioned for success as the next puzzle piece for industrial development in the Triangle.”

More than 20000 Chatham residents commute to jobs outside the county providing a key labor pool for Research Triangle Park Raleigh-Durham International Airport and other major employment areas. The county is fortunate to have sites ready for businesses to develop.

“Speed to market is very important with the companies looking for projects in North Carolina” Winters says.

Triangle Innovation has the zoning in place for heavy industrial projects and key infrastructure enabling companies to build a plant fairly quickly.

Some early interest in the project involves about 400 acres known as Tip West where a former Performance Fibers plant closed in 2014 and was demolished. Infrastructure such as utilities and sewer remain so Winters anticipates a speculative facility will be under construction by the end of the year and completed in late 2022. Tip West is a joint venture with Samet Corp. a general contracting firm based in Greensboro and Lee-Moore Capital a Sanford-based developer led by CEO Kirk Bradley.

Having a building ready for occupancy will be an asset particularly for international companies looking to launch their first U.S. operations says Al Williams a JLL vice president who is also working on the project. “We saw a significant amount of interest in an existing building we had in Goldsboro from international companies that didn’t have an existing presence in the U.S.”

Melissa Smith expects the Triangle Innovation project to follow the example of the Grounds of Concord in Cabarrus County. The former site of a giant Philip Morris cigarette plant and a failed battery manufacturer it recently landed three big companies that plan more than $1 billion in investment for beverage manufacturing and distribution plants totaling 3 million square feet by 2027.

“We’ve seen what has happened there and I think Chatham County is positioned well to be that next thing” she says. “If manufacturers want suppliers close by — and that was the driver at Grounds of Concord — then a 2100-acre opportunity like [Triangle Innovation] that can be carved out around a specific set of needs is ideal.” ■",,,,,,

It’s pretty much a case of reading about them on these fine pages or perhaps looking at a piece of one behind glass in one of the more interesting museums out there. But now there is another option (THAT) The Analog Thing. Developed by Berlin-based Analog computer-on-chip specialist Anabrid THAT is an Open Source analog computer you can build yourself (eventually) or buy from them fully assembled. At least that’s their plan.

From the 1970s onwards digital computers became powerful enough to replace analog computers in pretty much every area and with the increased accuracy this brought the old analog beasts became obsolete overnight. Now there seems to be a move to shift back a little with hybridized analog-digital approaches looking good for some applications especially where precision is not paramount. After all that pile of fatty grey matter between your ears is essentially a big analog computer and that’s pretty good at problem solving.

Looking over the project Wiki there are a few application examples and some explanatory notes. Schematics are shown albeit only images for now. We can’t find the PCB files either but the assembly instructions show many bodge wires so we guess they’re re-spinning the PCB to apply fixes before releasing them properly. This is clearly work-in-progress and as they say on the main site their focus is on chips for hybrid analog-digital computing with a focus on energy-efficient approximate methods. With that in mind we can forgive that the community-focused learning tools are still being worked on. All that said this is still a very interesting project and definitely would be a Christmas present this scribe would be more than happy to unwrap.

We’ve covered many aspects of analog computing lately like this story of restoration (and ultimately demise) a maritime astrolabe found in the Arabian Sea and even an FPGA simulating an analog computing architecture.

The video shows a simulation of a Lorenz attractor running on THAT slowed down 100x (by changing integrator settings) so that the simulation can run slow enough to be plotted by a mechanical X-Y plotter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMDMvYXJ0cy9tdXNpYy9kdXRjaC1uYXRpb25hbC1vcGVyYS11cGxvYWQtcmV2aWV3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: In 'Upload' Do Blockchains Dream of Electric Lizards? (Published 2021),"AMSTERDAM — “I’m here that’s for sure!” the digital facsimile of a father tells his daughter early in Michel van der Aa’s new opera “Upload.”

What exactly it means to be “here” — particularly when someone exists only as consciousness stored on blockchain data spread across thousands of servers — is up for debate and guides the drama in “Upload” a masterly weaving of music film and motion-capture technology that opened at the Dutch National Opera here on Friday ahead of a run at the Park Avenue Armory in New York next spring.

But that sci-fi premise is little more than a veneer. Not for nothing did Mary Shelley give “Frankenstein” the subtitle “The Modern Prometheus”; the finest genre fiction has always examined humanity through allegory. So too does van der Aa’s spare yet richly complicated work which is preoccupied less with futuristic speculation than timeless matters of the heart and mind whether corporeal or in the cloud.

Which is not to say that van der Aa is uninterested in the bleeding edge. Rather for decades and with mixed success he has been at the fore of marrying traditional forms with new media — inventing software and putting his film degree to regular use — through for example 3-D technology in the opera “Sunken Garden” and virtual reality in the poetic installation “Eight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vaGFja2FkYXkuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMDIvc3RlcHBlcnMtYW5kLWVzcDMyLW1ha2UtdGhpcy1yZXRyby1tb2Rlcm4tZmxpcC1jbG9jay10aWNrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steppers And ESP32 Make This Retro-Modern Flip-Clock Tick,"Before LEDs became cheap enough to be ubiquitous flip-card displays were about the only way to get a digital clock. These entirely electromechanical devices had their own charm and they have a certain retro cachet these days. Apart from yard sales and thrift stores though they’re a bit hard to source — unless you roll your own of course.

Granted [David Huang]’s ESP32-based flip clock is worlds apart from the flip cards of the “I Got You Babe” era. Unfortunately the video below is all we have to go on to get the story behind this clock but it’s pretty self-explanatory. [David] started the build by making the flip cards themselves a process that takes some topological tricks as well as a laser cutter. 3D-printed spools are loaded with the cards which are then attached to frames that hold a stepper motor and a Hall-effect sensor. The ESP32 drives the steppers via L298N H-bridge drivers but it’s hard to say if there’s an RTC chip or if the microcontroller is just getting time via an NTP server.

[David] might not be the only one trying to recapture that retro look but we’ve got to hand it to him — it’s a great look and it takes a clever maker to not only build a clock like this but to make a video that explains it all so clearly without a single word of narration.

Apple recently released a feature in iOS 15 that allows users to upload their COVID-19 vaccination records through its Health app with a QR code sent by their provider a downloadable file sent by their provider or through a connected healthcare institution using Health Records on iPhone.

►Apple will soon let you put your vaccination card in Wallet: Here's what it'll look like

United customers can now share those verified vaccination records on the Apple Health app with United’s Travel-Ready Center.

Users start on the United app where they can see their upcoming flights on the home screen.

If they click into the Trip Details they can see reservation information about their flight. In the Travel-Ready Center tab they can click ""View More Details"" and see what COVID-19 requirements are required for their upcoming flight.

If they click ""Upload documentation"" they can see options to upload test paperwork for agent review upload vaccination documents for agent review or share their SMART Health Card. If they select ""Share your SMART Health Card"" users will see a screen saying ""Share COVID-19 vaccinations"" that allows them to share a health record with United on a one-time basis.

Only the vaccination information not any other information on the Health app is shared with United. Once confirmed the vaccination records will automatically be uploaded and verified on United’s system and records will be stored only until they complete their travels.

United Airlines recently said that for most cases employees who did not get their vaccinations would no longer be allowed into the workplace by Oct. 2.

Jeff Bezos in 1994 founded Amazon.com in a garage in Seattle soon after he quit from the hedge fund company D.E. Shaw. In fact he had initially started with the idea of an online bookstore to his former boss David E. Shaw who wasn’t interested.

Although Amazon.com primarily started by selling books it has since modified into a one-stop shop for almost everything under the sun and is considered the world’s largest retailer. At any time it is hard to contradict its self-description as the “Earth’s most customer-centric company.” Its pattern of constant modification is apparent in some of its stunning expansions including procuring Whole Foods in 2017 and starting its own branded over-the-counter drugs in August 2017.

In 2020 Amazon’s stock price skyrocketed on the intensified demand for online shopping as lockdowns urged people to stay home. On July 5 2021 Bezos stepped down as the CEO of the e-commerce company and shifted to his new role as its executive chairman.

Bezos for the first time took Amazon public in 1997 and became the first man since Bill Gates in 1999 to obtain a net worth of more than $100 billion. Bezos’s other successful projects are as follows:

Aerospace company Blue Origin.

The Washington Post which he purchased in 2013.

The 10000-year clock also known as the Long Now.

On July 20 2021 Bezos with his brother Mark aviation pioneer Wally Funk and Dutch student Oliver Daemen finished Blue Origin’s first successful crewed flight reaching an altitude of just above 62 miles before landing safely.

Arnault remained Férinel’s chairman for another six years until he procured and reorganized luxury goods maker Financière Agache in 1984 ultimately selling all of its holdings other than Christian Dior and Le Bon Marché.

The most famous living value investor Warren Buffett filed his first tax return in 1944 at age 14 declaring his earnings from his boyhood paper route. He first purchased shares in a textile company called Berkshire Hathaway in 1962 thereby becoming the majority shareholder by 1965. He expanded the company to insurance and other investments in 1967. Now Berkshire Hathaway is a half-trillion-dollar company with a single share of stock trading at more than $410000 per share in mid-2021.

Popularly known as the “Oracle of Omaha” Buffett made the bulk of his fortune through purchasing shares in companies with easy-to-understand business operations. While many investors have been gathering into tech companies Buffett has opted for a more careful approach only buying from well-established companies that are easier to understand such as IBM and Apple. He is also a noted Bitcoin agnostic. Additionally Buffett has also entirely purchased a lengthy list of companies over the years including Dairy Queen Duracell GEICO and Kraft Heinz.

Outside of investing Buffett has donated much of his wealth toward humanitarian efforts.

Three years following Ellison joined Precision Instruments serving as the company’s vice president of research and development.

By 1977 Ellison had established Software Development Laboratories (SDL) along with Oates and Miner which two years later released Oracle the first commercial relational database program to utilize Structured Query Language. The database program proved so popular that SDL would change its name to Oracle Systems Corporation in 1982. Additionally Ellison joined Tesla’s board in December 2018.

Oracle is the second-largest software company and provides a wide variety of cloud computing programs and other software such as Java and Linux and the Oracle Exadata computing platform.

Age: 48

Residence: Palo Alto California

Co-founder and Board Member: Alphabet

Net Worth: $91.5 billion1

Alphabet Ownership Stake: 6 percent ($115 billion total)

Other Assets: $13.8 billion in cash

Like several tech billionaires on this list Larry Page’s claim to fame got its start in a college dorm room. While attending Stanford University in 1995 Page and his friend Sergey Brin came up with the idea of improving data extraction capabilities while accessing the Internet. The duo invented a new type of search engine technology they dubbed “Backrub” named after its ability to analyze “backing links.” From there Page and Brin went on to found Google in 1998 with the former serving as CEO of the company until he stepped down in 2001.

Google is one of the largest Internet search engines on the planet accounting for more than 70 percent of global online search requests. In 2006 Google (the company) expanded by acquiring YouTube the biggest platform for user-submitted videos. Then 2008 saw the release of the first mobile phone utilizing the Android operating system which Android Inc. originally developed prior to Google acquiring the company in 2005. Today Google is a subsidiary of Alphabet a holding company for which Page served as CEO from 2015 to 2019.

Page is also a founding investor of Planetary Resources a space exploration and asteroid-mining company. Initially established in 2009 the firm was acquired by blockchain firm ConsenSys in 2018 amid funding problems. He has also shown an interest in “flying car” companies having invested in Kitty Hawk and Opener.

9. Sergey Brin

Age: 48

Residence: Los Altos California

Co-founder and Board Member: Alphabet

Net Worth: $89 billion

Alphabet Ownership Stake: 5 percent ($110.1 billion total)

Other Assets: $13.9 billion in cash

Compared to the other companies featured on this list what makes Google unique is that its co-founders are relatively close in terms of total wealth. Sergey Brin’s engagement in Google follows a similar path to Page’s. After the duo founded the company in 1998 Brin served as co-president alongside Page until Eric Schmidt took over as CEO in 2001. Similarly after establishing Alphabet in 2015 Brin acted as the holding company’s president before stepping down in 2019 when Sundar Pichai took over as CEO.

In addition to being a top-rated search engine Google also offers a suite of online tools and services known as Google Workspace which includes Gmail Google Drive Google Calendar Google Meet Google Chat Google Docs Google Sheets Google Slides and more. In addition to software Google also deals in various electronic devices including its Pixel smartphones its Pixelbook computers and tablets its Nest smart home devices and its Stadia gaming platform.

Brin spent much of 2019 focusing on X Alphabet’s “moonshot” research laboratory responsible for innovative technologies like the Waymo self-driving cars and Google Glass smart glasses. He has also donated millions of dollars toward researching a cure for Parkinson’s and partnered with The Michael J. Fox Foundation to devise new drugs against LRRK2 one of the most significant genetic contributors to the disease.

10. Mukesh Ambani

Age: 64

Residence: Mumbai India

Chair and Managing Director: Reliance Industries

Net Worth: $84.5 billion

Reliance Industries Ownership Stake: 42 percent ($86.09 billion total)

Other Assets: Mumbai residential property ($410 million private assets) and $975 million in cash

Reliance Industries was initially founded as a small textile manufacturer by Dhirubhai Ambani in 1966. In 1979 Dhirubhai’s son Mukesh moved to Palo Alto California to attend Stanford Business School. A year later Mukesh returned home at his father’s command to oversee the construction of a new polyester mill during which time he also joined Reliance Industries’ board. Rather than moving back to the U.S. to finish his university program Mukesh remained in India to lead Reliance’s backward integration initiative. During the 1990s he initiated the company’s efforts to create and acquire multiple petrochemical plants and petroleum refineries.

In 2002 Dhirubhai suffered a stroke and passed away. The lack of a will resulted in a feud between Mukesh and his brother Anil over how their father’s empire would be distributed. Three years later due to a settlement brokered by their mother the siblings agreed to split the business with Mukesh retaining control over refining petrochemicals oil and gas and textile operations. This didn’t entirely ease the tension between the two brothers as they would neither settle a legal dispute over sharing natural gas nor dissolve their non-compete agreements until 2010.

In 2013 Mukesh and Anil seemingly buried the hatchet with the announcement of a $220 million pact to share a fiber-optic network between their two companies.

Reliance Industries has founded several highly successful subsidiaries under Mukesh’s leadership including Reliance Retail and telecommunications company Jio. He is also a member of The Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum an elected Foreign Member of the United States National Academy of Engineering a member of the Global Advisory Council of Bank of America and a member of the International Advisory Council of The Brookings Institution.

Key takeaway

If you want to get a little nearer to be among Forbe’s richest billionaires list you might need to become a technological innovator or a retail king. Or you can keep it simple and target on value investing. It also wouldn’t hurt to start by coming from wealth as Arnault Ambani and some other super-wealthy individuals did; think Jim Walton (#18 on Forbes’ list) and Charles Koch (#27). However the most exceptional fortunes on this decorated list started off as great ideas from people with the drive creativity and connections to make them take off.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

""Si elle le veut bien !""

Galvaudé de nos jours le terme ""iconique"" a semble-t-il été inventé pour décrire Madonna. Forte de 40 ans de carrière la chanteuse s'apprête à regarder dans le rétroviseur en rééditant ses albums cultes en version deluxe dès 2022. Mais ce n'est pas tout ! Alors que son concert du ""Madame X Tour"" s'apprête à sortir en streaming  l'artiste planche sur son biopic  qu'elle écrira et réalisera elle-même . «» expliquait-elle avant d'en dire plus : «».Actuellement en préparation finalement sans la scénariste Diablo Cody - Oscarisée pour ""Juno"" - suite à des différends créatifs ce film sur la vie de Madonna est forcément très attendu par le grand public. Mais une question cruciale se pose désormais : quelle actrice jouera la chanteuse dans son biopic ? Le mystère reste entier mais l'étau se resserre. L'an dernier la jeune comédienne Anne Winters vue dans la série ""13 Reasons Why"" se déguisait en Madonna à différentes périodes cultes de sa carrière sur Instagram en affichant sa détermination : «». Bingo : l'interprète de ""Like a Prayer"" l'a félicitée en message privé ! Mais rien n'est encore officiel car une autre actrice est dans la course...En effet admirée dans les films ""Black Widow"" ""Midsommar"" ou encore ""Les Filles du docteur March"" Florence Pugh pourrait bien incarner Madonna au cinéma dans ce que la star décrit comme «». «» a répondu Madonna en personne à l'lors de l'avant-première du concert ""Madame X"" interrogée sur les rumeurs de casting. Ce ne serait pas une mauvaise idée puisque Florence Pugh est aussi passionnée de musique elle qui publie des reprises musicales sur sa chaîne YouTube et fait les choeurs sur le single ""Midnight"" de son frère Toby Sebastian. Dans la foulée Madonna a qualifié ce projet de biopic d'«» : «».",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmFuY2UyNC5jb20vZnIvaW5mby1lbi1jb250aW51LzIwMjExMDAzLWwtYWxnJUMzJUE5cmllLWludGVyZGl0LWxlLXN1cnZvbC1kZS1zb24tdGVycml0b2lyZS1hdXgtYXZpb25zLW1pbGl0YWlyZXMtZnJhbiVDMyVBN2Fpc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,L'Algérie interdit le survol de son territoire aux avions militaires français,"Après avoir rappelé son ambassadeur en France à la suite de propos critiques d'Emmanuel Macron Alger a interdit son espace aérien aux avions militaires de l'Hexagone a annoncé dimanche l'armée française.

De nouvelles turbulences dans le ciel déjà orageux des relations entre Alger et Paris. L'Algérie a interdit le survol de son territoire aux avions militaires français qui empruntent d'habitude son espace aérien pour rejoindre ou quitter la bande sahélo-saharienne où sont déployées les troupes de l'opération antijihadiste Barkhane a indiqué dimanche 3 octobre un porte-parole de l'état-major français.

Cette décision intervient dans un contexte de tensions entre Paris et Alger qui a annoncé samedi le ""rappel immédiat pour consultation"" de son ambassadeur à Paris exprimant son ""rejet catégorique"" de déclarations attribuées au président français Emmanuel Macron évoquant notamment ""un système politico-militaire"" au pouvoir à Alger.

""Ce matin en déposant les plans de vol de deux avions nous avons appris que les Algériens fermaient le survol de leur territoire aux avions militaires français"" a déclaré à l'AFP le colonel Pascal Ianni confirmant des informations révélées par le quotidien Le Figaro. L'état-major n'a reçu aucune notification officielle de cette décision a-t-il précisé.

""Cela perturbe très légèrement le flux de soutien les avions doivent adapter leur plan de vol mais cela n'affecte ni les opérations ni les missions de renseignement"" menées par la France au Sahel a commenté le colonel Ianni en assurant que l'état-major français n'avait ""pas d'inquiétude à ce stade"".

""Rente mémorielle""

Les relations entre Paris et Alger se sont fortement tendues ces derniers jours alors qu'approche le 60e anniversaire de la fin de la guerre d'Algérie et son indépendance.

Selon un article du quotidien Le Monde relatant une rencontre entre Emmanuel Macron et de jeunes descendants de protagonistes de la guerre d'Algérie (1954-1962) le président français aurait estimé qu'après son indépendance en 1962 l'Algérie s'est construite sur ""une rente mémorielle"" entretenue par ""le système politico-militaire"".

01:39

Selon Le Monde Emmanuel Macron a évoqué aussi ""une histoire officielle totalement réécrite"" qui ""ne s'appuie pas sur des vérités"" mais sur ""un discours qui repose sur une haine de la France"".

Mercredi l'ambassadeur de France François Gouyette avait par ailleurs été convoqué au ministère des Affaires étrangères algérien pour se voir notifier ""une protestation formelle"" après la décision de Paris de réduire de moitié les visas accordés aux Algériens souhaitant se rendre en France.

L'interdiction de l'espace aérien algérien aux avions militaires français tombe au milieu d'une phase logistique délicate pour l'état-major qui a entamé depuis quelques semaines une réorganisation de son dispositif dans la bande sahélo-saharienne.

Sur décision d'Emmanuel Macron la France est en train de quitter les bases militaires les plus au nord du Mali (Kidal Tombouctou et Tessalit) et va réduire le nombre de troupes au Sahel d'ici 2023 à 2 500-3 000 hommes contre plus de 5 000 aujourd'hui.

Le Foyer rural a tenu son assemblée générale. C'est devant une assistance nombreuse et en présence de Sylvain Porta adjoint aux associations qu'Eliane Lacroix la présidente après avoir fait observer une minute de silence en mémoire de Jacqueline Laurensou Jean Scaillierez et Jeannot Vieillefond a tracé un bilan forcément peu fourni en activités suite aux problèmes sanitaires liés au Covid.

Odile Pollin faisait de même pour présenter la trésorerie avant le renouvellement des membres dirigeants qui ont accueilli Anne-Marie une nouvelle bonne volonté prête à s'investir dans cette association forte de près de 200 adhérents et riche en activités présentées par chaque responsable des diverses sections.

Sylvain Porta louait d'ailleurs le dynamisme du Foyer avant que ne soit désigné le bureau Eliane Lacroix en assurant la continuité à la présidence. Le plaisir des « retrouvailles » autour du traditionnel pot de l'amitié laissait bien augurer d'une nouvelle année de fonctionnement que chacun espère évidemment bien différente.

Le troisième album studio du jeune rappeur américain NBA YoungBoy « Sincerely Kentrell » a réussi à surpasser « Certified Lover Boy » du Canadien Drake un mastodonte de l’industrie musicale mondiale après tout. NBA YoungBoy serait devenu le troisième rappeur de l’histoire du hip-hop à figurer en tête des charts derrière les géants Lil Wayne et Tupac Shakur.

NBA YoungBoy de son vrai nom Kentrell DeSean Gaulden qui s’est fait mondialement connaître avec le titre « Outside Today » qui s’est placé à la 31ème place du Billboard Hot 100 en 2018 entre un peu plus dans l’histoire. Avec son troisième album studio « Sincerely Kentrell » il a réussi à détrôner « Certified Lover Boy » du Canadien Drake dans le Billboard 200. Il a remporté son quatrième album n°1 et il est également devenu le troisième rappeur de l’histoire du hip-hop à figurer en tête des charts derrière les monuments du rap américain Lil Wayne et Tupac Shakur.

Malgré la victoire bien méritée de NBA YoungBoy la course entre « Sincerely Kentrell » et « Certified Lover Boy » était vraiment aussi serrée que les prévisions précédentes. Selon Hits Daily Double l’album de NBA YoungBoy n’a surpassé celui de Drake que de moins de 3 000 unités équivalentes à un album avec « Sincerely Kentrell » 137 775 et « Certified Lover Boy » 134 949. La semaine dernière Lil Nas X a tenté de détrôner Drake mais les ventes de la première semaine de « Montero » de 129 000 n’étaient pas suffisantes pour dépasser les 170 000 unités équivalentes à un album de « CLB ».

Pourtant le premier album de Lil Nas X reste une force commerciale déplaçant 59 869 unités équivalentes à un album et assurant la 3ème place dans le classement des albums américains. « Donda » de Kanye West se maintient à la 4ème place dans sa cinquième semaine de classement et le premier album d’Olivia Rodrigo « SOUR » arrive à la 5ème place.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcmVwLmZyL29saXZldC00NTE2MC9wb2xpdGlxdWUvcmV0b3VyLXN1ci1sYW5uZWUtMjAyMC1kZXMtcGlzY2luZXMtZXQtZHUtY2FtcGluZy1tdW5pY2lwYWxfMTQwMjI0MjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Retour sur l'année 2020 des piscines et du camping municipal,"Lors du conseil municipal de lundi soir les élus ont pu prendre connaissance des rapports d’activité émanant des délégataires de services publics.

Les délégataires font le bilan

Le conseil de rentrée qui s'est tenu lundi soir a été comme chaque année à pareille époque le moment pour les élus de prendre connaissance des rapports d'activité des délégataires de services publics ceux touchant à l'année écoulée dans cas présent 2020.

Philippe Boissier le directeur régional de Vert Marine et Clément Matelot le nouveau directeur des piscines d'Olivet ont d'abord présenté un bilan détaillé de l'Inox la piscine couverte et du Poutyl celle de plein air.

Les piscines

limitent la casse

On a ainsi appris que 60.645 baigneurs auront fréquenté l'Inox en 2020 contre 138.366 en 2019 soit une baisse de 56 %. Côté Poutyl 14.718 baigneurs y ont piqué une tête l'an passé contre 38.679 en 2019 (- 62 %). Le compte de résultat des deux piscines est ainsi de 64.242 euros pour 2020 alors que le prévisionnel tablait sur 50.000 euros. D'où une certaine satisfaction compte tenu de la crise sanitaire. Pour mémoire les chiffres 2019 s'élevaient à 239.523 euros.

En cette rentrée 2021 les activités ont pu reprendre à l'Inox : bébés nageurs jardin aquatique location de vélos clubs de natation et de plongée…

Triste camping

Sur un ton désolé Agnès Guisembert la délégataire du camping municipal a ensuite indiqué : « 2020 est une saison inédite. Si juillet et août ont pu être sauvés cela ne compense pas le printemps perdu à cause du confinement et l'automne perdu suite au passage du Loiret en zone rouge. Nous avons tout mis en place pour limiter les dégâts en faisant des économies sur les dépenses tout en assurant une qualité de service. Malgré tout nous accusons un bilan financier négatif une baisse du chiffre d'affaires de 36 % en 2020. »

Vingt-sept nationalités ont séjourné au camping municipal avec en tête les touristes originaires des Pays-Bas suivis des Français et des Allemands. En 2021 le camping aura maintenu ses activités. Il entend les poursuivre lors de la saison 2022 avec un bémol cependant : « Nous ne pourrons pas satisfaire nos clients avec la location de canoës puisque le pont Cotelle est en travaux jusqu'en 2022. Cette activité est un facteur attractivité avec derrière un chiffre d'affaires non négligeable » déplore la délégataire. La location de vélos aux campeurs (et aux gens de l'extérieur) ainsi que le marché fermier et créateurs seront quant à eux reconduits."

What Makes Art Appealing to Billionaire Investors?

Art investment holds a strong appeal for billionaires due to several critical factors:

This confidentiality adds an extra layer of privacy to their financial activities appealing to those who value discretion in their investment strategies.

Beginning on May 31 Season 1 of the animated sci-fi drama will begin streaming on Netflix in the U.S. the U.K. Ireland and New Zealand. The Netflix deal is non-exclusive meaning the episodes will remain available on Max. Sources tell Variety that Netflix is considering picking up “Scavengers Reign” for a second season but a decision won’t be made until after Season 1’s debut on the streamer.

The series is set on an alien planet where a damaged interstellar freighter ship gets stranded and follows the remaining crew as they struggle to locate their ship and missing crewmates while navigating a hostile world that has thrived without human interference.

Variety named “Scavengers Reign” one of the top 19 shows of 2023 with critic Alison Herman writing that it “pairs the engrossing ambience of a nature documentary with the propulsive thrust of narrative. Its characters are fully realized and flawed but their main scene partners are an environment they need to intuit the workings of alongside the audience. The 12-episode season is a deep cut worth seeking out (or renewing if you’re the powers that be and Warner Bros. Discovery).”

“Scavengers Reign” was created Joseph Bennett and Charles Huettner who executive produce alongside Chris Prynoski. Sean Buckelew and James Merrill serve as co-executive producers with Benjy Brooke as supervising director. The series was produced by Green Street Pictures in partnership with Titmouse Inc.

“We are beyond thrilled that ‘Scavengers Reign’ will be joining the incredible animation lineup on Netflix” said Bennett Buckelew Merrill and Brooke on behalf of Green Street. “We’re immensely grateful to everyone who has watched the show already and to Netflix for giving it an opportunity to be discovered by a wider audience.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdGUuY29tL25ld3MvdG9wLXN0b3JpZXMvY3JlZGl0LWNhcmQtc2tpbW1lcnMtZm91bmQtYXQtMy1lYXN0LXRlbm5lc3NlZS1mb29kLWNpdHktbG9jYXRpb25zL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdGUuY29tL25ld3MvdG9wLXN0b3JpZXMvY3JlZGl0LWNhcmQtc2tpbW1lcnMtZm91bmQtYXQtMy1lYXN0LXRlbm5lc3NlZS1mb29kLWNpdHktbG9jYXRpb25zL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Credit card skimmers found at 3 East Tennessee Food City locations,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wate.com/news/top-stories/credit-card-skimmers-found-at-3-east-tennessee-food-city-locations/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdGUuY29tL25ld3MvdG9wLXN0b3JpZXMvY3JlZGl0LWNhcmQtc2tpbW1lcnMtZm91bmQtYXQtMy1lYXN0LXRlbm5lc3NlZS1mb29kLWNpdHktbG9jYXRpb25zL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdGUuY29tL25ld3MvdG9wLXN0b3JpZXMvY3JlZGl0LWNhcmQtc2tpbW1lcnMtZm91bmQtYXQtMy1lYXN0LXRlbm5lc3NlZS1mb29kLWNpdHktbG9jYXRpb25zL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3RvcC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtZmluYW5jZS8yMDI0LzA1L3Bva2VyLXBsYXllci13aW5zLTEtM20tYXQtbWdtLW5hdGlvbmFsLWhhcmJvci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Poker player wins $1.3M at MGM National Harbor,"A gambler at MGM National Harbor casino hit it big at the poker table on May 5 winning a nearly $1.3 million jackpot.

The $1.259 million payout came from a progressive jackpot while playing Ultimate Texas Hold ’em.

The winner is anonymous but MGM said they were a Virginia resident.

The winning hand was a Royal Flush of diamonds. In a seven-card poker game like Texas Hold ’em a Royal Flush occurs roughly once out of every 31000 hands dealt.

Ultimate Texas Hold ’em is similar to Texas Hold ’em with the exception of playing against only the dealer not other players.

It is not a record for a jackpot at MGM National Harbor. In March 2022 a player won a $3 million jackpot the casino record to date playing Face Up Pai-Gow Poker.

MGM National Harbor has 207 table games — more than any other Maryland casino — and 2275 slots. It had $68.1 million in gaming revenue in April."

When it comes to digital twins one might have assumed it would be one of the big software companies that would democratise the technology. After all large global firms have all the resources access to millions of customers deep pockets and long arms.

However to date the most accessible and obvious contender for a rounded digital twin ‘product’ comes from Newcastle upon Tyne in the UK.

Space Group is one of the few architectural practices that truly understands that programmers can solve problems in construction and if it can develop something which benefits its business it will probably be useful to others too.

Space Group’s Twinview is a cloud-based digital twin platform which works with data from most construction applications. While it started out life in the UK since its launch in 2020 it has gone global with resellers in Australia New Zealand Vietnam and Portugal.

The initial feature set was directly targeted at Facilities Management which we explored in this 2020 article.

However over the last 18 months it has expanded to also focus on carbon reduction and helping owners understand how buildings are actually used.

Lots of commercial clients are now becoming really concerned by carbon output. Real estate investment trusts are looking at environmental societal and governance aspects. Shareholders want to see increases in efficiency and reductions in carbon before they invest.

This means that the buying audience for digital twin technology is not so blinded by the hype but has very definite definable outcomes to monitor performance for deploying twin technology.

Last year Internet of Things (IoT) connections to Twinview were still experimental but now the company has a number of clients with its Building Management Systems (BMS) wired into Twinview services. We asked Space Group’s Adam Ward how definitive IoT devices were to saving money for clients.

“We know at a device level at a room level at a floor level on a building level on a portfolio level (which has multiple buildings) all that data. With Twinview everything we do is based on building the data from the asset level up. For example if we have a sensor on a boiler we’ll have temperature water flow rate etc. That data streams on an asset level that asset belongs to a room that room sits on a floor level that floor level sits in a zone that zone sits in a building that building sits in a portfolio of a building. Because we have that data structure we can look at all the energy use in the kitchen on level seven down to a particular asset.”

Most new builds are now coming with BMS built into many of the key components – boilers heating and ventilation systems. The problem is that traditionally access to the sensors has been locked away and apart from servicing if there is an issue it is only identified when something goes wrong.

Twinview can be wired up to these systems through APIs to get data across all assets in a building even controlling the devices as well such as turning valves on or off.

Ward was quick to highlight the benefits of this “We can hardwire your triggers so if the temperature drops below 20° in our node assistant engine we can create a rule that automatically raises a ticket to alert facilities management.” “The real super value is doing something with this data” explains Space Group CEO Rob Charlton. “At the moment it’s static in that we’re using it to turn things on turn things off looking at performance.

“In a couple of years or sooner there will be some really interesting machine learning around the autonomous controls on buildings. We are working on it now with universities. It will be basically merging building performance with building usage to learn from the building and use AI to optimise it. Ward added “We are already able to see when there is a 97% chance that the boiler is going to break in the next six months. We know the failure curves from many of the manufacturers.

“These will tell you that if you run a boiler at 30 degrees at 90% capacity for more than 24 hours a day its failure rate is ‘x’.

“If you take that failure rate data and combine it with how the assets are maintained and used in the building information available through our FM system then you can train a machine learning system to make failure predictions.”

New features for 2021

Capture is the fourth module within Twinview – the others being Access Manage and Analytics. It is designed to replace the manual and error-prone process of defining collating and validating asset data. Firms first define who is responsible for what data and at what stage. The system then emails the consultant a login to populate their data as defined in the AIR (Asset Information Requirements). Capture then validates that the data is correct provides reports capabilities and audit logs and can output BS1192:4 (COBie).

Document Vault is a new Common Data Environment (CDE) for documents and Operations and Maintenance (O&M) information whether associated with an asset or not. If a document is associated with an asset it can be tagged meaning it then appears as an asset attachment in Twinview. This could be a test certificate or warranty.

Field app is an iOS and Android app which brings the desktop capabilities to mobile. It’s possible to raise tickets and attach photos. Users can get asset information on demand filtered by their location or with QR codes and even access data streams.

Dashboards have been improved. In the first release they were only able to show data on a single project. Users can now create their own dashboards for their own requirements and can include data sources from multiple projects. There’s a widget library to quickly create bespoke widgets for dashboards too.

QR codes can now be created on the fly and these can be printed off and put on every maintainable asset within building. It’s then possible to use your mobile device to scan each asset and pull up relevant documents performance maintenance history etc.

Bluetooth Beacons are now supported in Twinview. There will be instances when assets are not accessible or within reach of a QR scan. When placed in a room each beacon makes Twinview mobile instances self-aware and you can get information streamed to your phone about all assets near your position.

Database enhancements are designed to make the system more efficient. With the ability to be connected to so many live IoT devices which collect and store data every second 10 or 20 seconds any database could soon become bloated. Twinview gets around this by only storing data when it changes.

Conclusion

Twinview’s development is progressing at quite a pace. While it was initially aimed at facilities managers it has diversified dramatically into a platform for many building performance and monitoring needs digging deeper and wider as customers give their feedback. It’s interesting that traditional facilities management has been slower to climb aboard the digital twin bandwagon with areas such as energy efficiency and carbon emissions starting to drive feature development.

It’s worth pondering just how far ahead Space Group is with its Twinview functionality versus Autodesk’s Tandem. It’s like night and day.

Talking with Rob Charlton and Adam Ward their enthusiasm for machine learning and AI is infectious. It doesn’t sound like we’re all that far off a time when computers our benevolent overlords will be running building operations autonomously.

Space voyage – becoming a software developer

Rob Charlton the CEO of Space Group explains how the North-East architecture firm accidentally morphed into a software developer

In my early career as an architect the most significant innovation was the advancement in Rotring pens from the bottled inks of Isograph to the cartridges of Rapidograph.

At Space Architects it was only with the introduction of parametric software in the early 2000s that we started to experience exponential change. And ever since we’ve been using technology to find new ways to design better buildings with more predictable outcomes.

Technology quickly became such an integral part of what we do that it led to the formation of Space Group a design and technology business focused on the built environment which also includes Bimstore BIM Technologies and more recently Twinview.

At Space Architects we originally used parametric software to address a resource shortage in the industry. After being asked regularly for advice on using software and other emerging technologies we then launched BIM Technologies one of the first BIM consultancies globally.

Our architects were also struggling to find manufacturer content for their models which led to the development of bimstore.

We realised we were entrepreneurial but we did not plan new businesses; instead we were interested in improving processes that became a service and ultimately a company.

The market has generally driven the need for separate businesses. Within the group however we operate as a single team. The individual companies compartmentalise what we do for the outside world to understand.

Internally we call this One Space where the value is when we connect everything.

Not all software or processes we have developed have become businesses. For example in 2014 we developed Warboard an issue management tool still used by the BIM Technologies team every day.

In 2007 we launched Digital Synergy our strategy to connect data in a single model for continued improvement in design construction and operation.

From BIM to digital twins

We quickly foresaw the value of collecting data through the building lifecycle which became the driver for developing our digital twin platform Twinview which launched in 2019. Twinview is a browser-based platform providing access to models and data collected through design and construction. Having consistent data that can be connected to existing Building Management Systems enables design models to become a digital twin.

As with bimstore and BIM Technologies Twinview is now a business in its own right. Fifteen years after its inception the Digital Synergy strategy is now a reality.

The data collected during design and construction is now used in the operational stage allowing property owners to optimise their buildings whilst improving future development.

Our current focus is to use Artificial Intelligence to learn how our buildings operate to predict and optimise performance.

We have certainly come a long way since the invention of the Rapidograph. While the role of the architect might not have changed much since the 16th Century the way in which buildings are designed and delivered is barely recognisable – from complexity and culture to procurement and (especially) technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,
ADP,Automatic Data Processing,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoYXJtdGVjaC5jb20vdmlldy9hdXRvbWF0aW5nLWFzZXB0aWMtbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Automating Aseptic Manufacturing,"An ongoing engineering challenge for aseptic drug manufacturing is to reduce the risk of contamination as much as possible. As it is well known that human operators are the biggest source of contamination in a cleanroom a growing consensus is that automated systems that eliminate human intervention are the future of aseptic processing. Pharmaceutical industry experts point to the successful use of both conventional and robotic automation in other industries such as semiconductor manufacturing and aseptic food processing as well as in pharmaceutical packaging and warehousing as a sign that the pharma industry should overcome its reluctance to change. This shift has begun in fill/finish processes and is moving further upstream into other aseptic manufacturing steps. Robotic technology in particular is finding use in drug compounding (1) and in closed gloveless isolators.

Advances in robotics

While conventional automation is suited for larger volume operations with simple motion and few changes robotic automation technology designed for cleanrooms offers the ability to perform different types of operations and handle multiple formats such as vials and syringes. Robots which can perform the repetitive tasks otherwise handled by human operators enable the move to closed systems that can operate without human intervention.

“Over the past 30 years the equipment evolution has been from open and manual [to] isolated and manual then isolated and automated and [now] closed and automated. In the next 5–10 years more robotic solutions will come into the pharma production world throughout all segments driven by new regulations more personalized medicine and more flexible machines” predicts Rudolf Michael Weiss global head of pharma robotics at Stäubli Robotics.

Regulatory authorities have expressed support for automation technologies as a means to limit aseptic interventions notes Laura Moody North American product manager at machine builder Syntegon Pharma Technology pointing to as far back as FDA’s 2004 aseptic processing guidance (2) and to recent conferences. “Even as recently as the 2021 International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering Aseptic Conference the reduction in risk to the drug product through the use of automation and robotics was reiterated by FDA representatives” says Moody. She says that acceptance by regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical manufacturers is helping drive innovations in robotics.

Operating multiple-product filling lines in accordance with the European Union’s draft Annex 1 (3) can be achieved with various technologies. One method is to use restricted access barrier systems (RABS) with fully automated hydrogen peroxide decontamination of the entire cleanroom prior to each batch says Arno Schroff director of site and plant development at contract development and manufacturing organization Vetter. Closed isolators are another increasingly important solution. “Our long-term vision is shifting from a human-centered production towards a fully automatic process with robotic equipment to further reduce possible risk to the product” he notes.

“The biggest news from the past year is that FDA and Health Canada have approved commercial products made using gloveless robotic isolators. Several of our customers have achieved this milestone” says John Harmer head of sales and marketing aseptic filling at Cytiva which acquired Vanrx a manufacturer of robotic aseptic filling machines in February 2021. “The industry has moved beyond ‘Will they work?’ to ‘Where else can we use them?’. Our prediction is that robotics will play an increasing role in manufacturing personalized medicines including mRNA peptides bacteriophages CRISPR-Cas9 and other genomic therapies.”

Reducing contamination

Compared to conventional RABS or isolator-based filling systems gloveless robotic isolators eliminate human intervention. “The sources of interventions have to be designed out and built around the capabilities of robotics” says Harmer. “Because these systems are standardized they can cut a year off the typical process of building filling capacity. Robotics handle vials syringes and cartridges the same way within presterilized tubs so flexibility is built in for the small-volume high-value drugs that currently fill biopharmaceutical pipelines.”

Syntegon’s new robotic fill/finish system the Versynta FFP [Flexible Filling Platform] was introduced in mid-2021 and is designed for small batches of up to 3600 containers (vials syringes or cartridges) per hour. The company’s microBatch system currently in development with Vetter is an automated production cell with a gloveless isolator designed for even smaller batches of 120–500 containers per hour says Moody. She notes that this system is currently in the detailed design phase and is expected to be launched in 2022.

Both solutions use robotics: while Versynta FFP uses a four-axis robot developed by Syntegon to transfer containers from one station to the next without glass-to-glass contact Versynta microBatch is a fully automated production cell. It is designed for flexibility in the types of containers and closures that can be processed. “It allows for the container and closure of a drug product to be dictated by the needs of the drug and usage of the patient not the limitations of the fill/finish machine” comments Moody.

The gloveless isolator also eliminates the need for glove testing and glove management; features integrating air management so that the isolator does not need a technical ceiling or interfaces to the building; and the design is standardized to allow quick delivery and validation notes Moody.

Schroff adds that an automated de-bagging system for presterilized packaging components eliminates human intervention to prevent contamination of materials entering the isolator. Automated line set-up monitoring and fill-weigh checks for process control are other benefits he notes.

The flexibility and rapid changeover required for fill/finish of small-batch parenteral drug products is better met by robotics than by traditional automation agrees Joe Hoff CEO of robotics manufacturer AST. Efficient cleaning reliable sterilization and high overall equipment effectiveness are other drivers for growth in demand of these systems he adds. “The biggest challenges engineers face when designing isolated fill lines are fitting the design into a small enclosed space; achieving good operator ergonomics; and ensuring all systems and penetrations are leak-tight and properly designed for cleanability and [hydrogen peroxide] sterilization” says Hoff.

Although some may still hold the misconception that robotics can’t be used in cleanrooms because moving parts may generate non-viable particulates this concern has already been resolved suppliers say. Robotic suppliers point out that robots for pharmaceutical cleanrooms have a hygienic design for low particulate generation and resistance to standard cleaning chemicals. They can also be designed to be resistant to hydrogen peroxide so they can withstand frequent decontamination.

Another aspect of design is planning for changing parts and performing maintenance. Xavier Gómez Garcia lyophilization portfolio manager at pharma equipment and engineering supplier Telstar points out that haptic interfaces allow users to remotely manipulate a robot. “Some of these devices allow the user to also feel the weight of the real object even without physically touching it. The precision is extremely high. [Systems could have a] built-in feature to change format parts and do basic maintenance through telematic [remotely operated] haptic devices without the need of glove ports or operators near the process zone” suggests Garcia.

Software for improving robotic motion continues to be improved. “The robot is embedded into the [information technology (IT)] structure of the machine and new software features like tele-manipulation remote joystick fault intervention and [motion controls such as] anti-sloshing movements for example need to be developed” says Weiss. He notes that Stäubli is currently developing specific pharma software features suited to robotics inside isolators.

Increasing predictability

In addition to lowering the risk of contamination robots increase predictability. Compared to robots humans can have difficulty being consistent with repetitive tasks requiring precision and accuracy suggests Toni Manzano cofounder and CSO of Aizon a pharma/biopharma software as a service provider and co-chair of the Parenteral Drug Association’s first Robotics and Automation conference held in April 2021.

While people need to be trained and periodically retrained—and it can be challenging to duplicate a process in multiple locations—robots are trained once and have the same precision no matter what the time day or location adds Martin Düblin managing director of consultancy One One Eleven GmbH and co-chair of the PDA conference with Manzano. High levels of standardization across multiple facilities simplifies operation and inspection.

Another benefit of robotics is easier qualification says Alex Armengol international senior sales director for SP i-Dositecno fill-finish products and SP Industries’ global leadership team member. He explains that a performance qualification protocol tests whether the aseptic manufacturing procedures are adequate to prevent contamination during actual drug production—via process simulations or media fills using a sterile microbiological growth medium—and replicate organism detection and counting (RODAC) surface-contact testing. Robots will require less RODAC testing because of their controlled movement. “The behavior and movement of personnel is difficult to control. Everyone behaves differently and often randomly” explains Armengol. “The methodical and controlled movement of robots within the aseptic processing area are key to providing a predictable quality environment. [In addition] one robot can typically cover many critical areas within the aseptic processing space.”

PAT and AI in pharmaceutical automation

IT systems are increasingly intertwined with operational technology systems in modern manufacturing systems; control signals are sent to the machine and the machine sends data to higher-level systems such as supervisory control and data acquisition systems. In addition to machine data data from process analytical technology (PAT) tools used in automated systems can improve quality and efficiency. In-process control (IPC) check-weighing in an automated filling system is one example notes Armengol. Conventionally check-weighing was a destructive test but using the PAT tool of IPC each container is weighed and no product is lost. “In this method [empty] containers are placed on an in-process balance or load system and the exact amount of product is dispensed and checked against the specification. Over a period of time if the controller senses any changes to the fill weight the system will adjust the pump appropriately” he explains. Additionally artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can use data to predict machine behavior and potential failure points adds Armengol. AI can identify process deviations and decisions can be made in real time to reject or accept products.

These data can also be used by process experts. For example Harmer says “If the filling system contributes to a consistent stream of data about a customer’s manufacturing process we have better evidence to optimize processes or improve drug product quality.”

Today’s machines are highly integrated into IT systems for sharing data such as batch records or for allowing remote viewing of machine performance or remote maintenance but machines in the future will advance into intelligent feedback and even predictive maintenance suggests Hoff.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s a film set for Netflix,"Netflix confirmed the build at The Pointe is for its new show “Florida Man.” (Port City Daily photo/Alexandria Sands Williams)

WILMINGTON –– Cargo containers colorful buildings and wooden structures have been popping up at The Pointe at Barclay in recent weeks grabbing the attention of drivers along Independence Boulevard and shoppers within the commercial complex.

The eye-catching build is a set for the Netflix show “Florida Man” which is filming in the Wilmington area. Cameron Management the real estate group that owns the once-vacant lot shared that the temporary setup will remain no longer than 30 days.

Construction teams have worked on the site regularly. According to film permits the production is slated to roll at the location for the first time in the coming week. The upcoming shoot is occurring over four consecutive days.

Netflix confirmed the build is for the new show “Florida Man” but did not respond to additional inquiries by press.

Production for the eight-episode season has been in the area since August and is expected to continue through November.

A portion of the shopping complex that was once empty is now home to multiple trailers portable toilets stacks of plywood construction equipment and a crane lifting stage lights over the lot. Surrounded by a chain-link fence a combination of random building façades have been constructed on the property: a fake AutoZone a brown barn-esque structure a building with cross detailing. Cargo containers are stacked along the outskirts barricading the set from the movie theater and nearby restaurants in The Pointe.

Starring Golden Globe- and Emmy-nominee Edgar Ramírez “Florida Man” follows a former policeman who must return to his home state to go on the hunt for a Philly mobster’s fugitive girlfriend. “What should be a quick gig becomes a spiraling journey into buried family secrets and an increasingly futile attempt to do the right thing in a place where so much is wrong” according to a summary submitted to Carolina Beach town council during the permitting process.

Ramírez is best known for his performance alongside Jennifer Garner in “Yes Day” also a Netflix production and as Gianni Versace in “American Crime Story” on FX Networks. He also plays one of the central antagonists in Disney’s “Jungle Cruise” in theaters now.

Other actors appearing in the show include Isaiah Johnson Sibongile Mlambo Paul Schneider Lauren Buglioli and Michael Esper.

Netflix landed the project through its first-look deal with Aggregate Films the company behind the streamer’s hit “Ozark.”

The show has traveled countywide to capture scenes from local churches to beach strands. So far the production has pulled film permits for Stevens Ace Hardware UniFirst Uniform Services Hell’s Kitchen Copper Penny and Quanto Basta among others.

Despite its title the show chose North Carolina where the film industry is currently booming; in Florida legislators let film tax credits expire in 2016. That’s become a sore spot in the Sunshine State and a point of debate among lobbyists advocating for revived incentives. North Carolina faced similar losses when its tax credits sunset in 2014. Since then the incentive program has been rebuilt as a grant program and the industry has recouped. Still the grant is capped unlike the open-ended tax credit that existed pre-2015.

However the union behind film crews began taking a strike authorization vote Friday. With a local outpost in Wilmington the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) is considering a walkout in protest of poor wages and conditions. Specifically the group is asking for better pay from streaming services like Netflix which has continued to receive discounts in pay rates compared to traditional media since its infancy.

A strike could potentially halt production nationwide for an unpredictable period of time.

“Florida Man” is one of three Netflix productions to choose New Hanover County as its filming location in 2021. Based on the novel by Chapel Hill author Sarah Dessen “Along For The Ride” filmed at the beaches earlier this year and is returning for three days this month to capture extra shots. The psychological thriller series “Echoes” is a tenant of EUE/Screen Gems Studios.

Also in the area Fox drama “Our Kind of People” Amazon’s “The Summer I Turned Pretty” and the film “Breakwater” are rolling. Several more projects are in pre-production.

I am going to replace the spark plugs.

The recommended iridium spark plugs NGK or Denso are very expensive. Some online prices for the same spark plug are almost half the cost.

There are numerous articles on the internet warning of fake spark plugs.

Are these cheap spark plugs OK to use and how can one tell the difference between the fake spark plugs and the real ones? - W.N. Woodbury Minnesota

A: Cheap auto parts are often counterfeit. Not only may they fail to work properly buying counterfeit parts harms the true manufacturers' income and reputation.

It is nearly impossible to tell the difference by simply looking at the item or the box so buy your auto parts from a reputable parts store which you can also do online.

Q: I have a 2009 Toyota Rav4 with 166000 miles on it.

My independent garage of 25+ years closed.

I went to a highly recommended shop. They changed the oil but couldn't get the filter off.

They said that they would have to break something (housing?) to get it off. They did not have the new parts.

They said I could drive it another 5000 miles with the old filter and when I come back they will order the new parts ahead of time to repair and replace the filter.

I am nervous about driving with the old filter for 5000 more miles.

Should I just go to another shop and start over again? - N.P. Ramsey Minnesota

A: I am unclear on what part they need but it is not uncommon for the cap to need replacement.

If so they are readily available from most auto parts stores as well as a Toyota dealer. As for driving another 5000 miles you should be fine.

But chances are that the shop will locate a new part well before that.

You should try another shop as soon as convenient. Maybe they will be able to replace your filter. No need to get another oil change though.

Q: Recently we were driving our 2010 Hyundai Tucson in stop-and-go traffic. Each time that we stopped the air coming out the register in the dashboard while cool was not as cool as it usually is.

When traffic started moving at 30 mph the air came out much cooler. I looked through the grill at the condenser and it was heavily caked with dirt and dead bugs.

Using a pressure nozzle I rinsed the condenser thoroughly and the output air temperature came down. Saved a trip to the shop. - S.B. Las Vegas

A: Good catch and often overlooked by motorists living in dusty areas.

Not only is the airflow across the A/C condenser blocked but the radiator sitting behind it suffers too.

Q: I have a 2011 Ford Focus and I am having a hard time locating the cabin air filter. Does it have one or not? It has never been changed and my A/C doesn't blow very cold. Do you think a bad cabin filter could be the cause? - G.B. Roseville Minnesota

A: If you have normal airflow from the vents when you are not using the air conditioner the cabin air filter is not causing a restriction.

The filter on the 2011-2018 Focus is located on the left side of the passenger foot well. You must first remove a panel below the glove box to access the cover for the filter. It is not a simple job.

Hughes then beat and shot him to death.

On Saturday the Maryland Lynching Truth and Reconciliation Commission examined Hughes' slaying in the first of its regional public hearings. The two-hour virtual session aimed to help uncover the facts of what happened that night heal decades-long wounds caused by the act of racial terror and chart a way forward for the community.

Maryland's panel is the first commission dedicated to investigating racial terror lynchings in the United States. It is to research cases of lynching hold public hearings in communities where lynchings took place and develop recommendations rooted in restorative justice to address the legacy of lynching.

""I'm so glad that we have gotten to this point where we can have this moment where we can tell these stories because the first step in healing is to tell the truth"" commission Chairman David Fakunle said at the end of the hearings. ""And as human beings we know how hard it is to tell the truth.""

To get to the truth of what happened to Hughes Heidi Gardner a genealogist historian and librarian provided an overview of the information she gathered through official documents newspaper articles and other accounts. Family members provided perspectives about the impact of Hughes' slaying. And four Allegany County people talked about how to move forward with that knowledge.

'No one was ever held accountable'

Gardner said she found conflicts in some basic facts beyond the use of two names. Hughes' age for example has been reported as 18 in some places and 22 elsewhere.

Hughes had come from Virginia to Allegany County. He had been there for seven months and had worked as a hotel porter and as a driver for a Black business owner.

After work on Oct. 3 Hughes and another Black man named Jesse Page visited a couple of local saloons. At the second saloon Hughes was accused of disorderly conduct and thrown out.

August Baker a white Cumberland police officer arrived to arrest him. A struggle ensued. Baker reportedly struck Hughes with a mace. Hughes allegedly shot Baker who died.

Page fled but later turned himself in. He was cleared of any charges and released.

""It not for Mr. Burns (Hughes) stating that Jesse Page was uninvolved in the incident I'm not sure I would be here today"" said Renee Page his great-granddaughter.

""He spent much of his life being distant inwardly hiding"" she said. Her great-grandfather clearly wished to avoid conflicts ""because Jesse Page surely knew how they could end.""

On Oct. 5 a mob began gathering outside the jail. Despite the crowd only one officer was on duty.

And shortly after midnight the mob breached the jail abducted Hughes and killed him.

""Despite the mob's lawlessness and failures of law enforcement that resulted in the lynching of William Burns (Hughes) no one was ever held accountable for his death"" Gardner said.

'Knowing that all lives matter'

Hughes' death was a mystery to the family until this summer when the link to the Burns name was established according to Angela Hughes Davidson. Hughes and her grandfather John Henry Hughes were brothers.

""We are here today because Robert was the victim of a lynching"" she said. ""It has been described as horrific and yet not a lot different from other such events described and recorded in American history.""

The story of Robert Hughes aka William Burns is one of at least 29 documented cases of racial terror lynching with African American victims in the state of Maryland between 1877 and 1950.

Angela Hughes Davidson asked that Saturday's hearing serve as the start of a longer process.

""Only with this ... acceptance of truth can our family our community our nation move forward in hope knowing that all lives matter"" she said.

Another descendant Karen White has researched the family's history. She said Hughes' father was a minister and his mother was a school teacher.

""I have searched many years for information on my great-uncle"" she said.

She still has many questions particularly about his life and circumstances in Cumberland.

'Reimagine what true justice can look like'

To close the meeting the commission put questions to Tiffany Fisher the president of the Allegheny County NAACP; Chuck Turner chief of the Cumberland Police Department; Teresa McMahon a journalist from the Cumberland Times-News; and Elliott Spillers of the Equal Justice Initiative.

New laws:Maryland statutes address health care equity other issues

Historic house:Jonathan Street cabin '21st century historic preservation at its best'

Highway widening:Feds put $92M I-81 project on a list for loan aid not a grant; MD says 'no thanks'

Some highlights of their responses when asked about racial reconciliation and healing:

Fisher: ""I think in order for us to get to choose and reconciliation and healing we have to stop stopping at identifying who the oppressor and the oppressed are. We know that. ... Everyone has to be open and vulnerable to be honest about how their history affects how they respond to situations today. And then once we get there we can talk about healing with each other. We can't get to the reconciliation if we haven't healed.""

Turner: A first step toward healing ""would be to identify the stress points that caused these biases acknowledge them and then work towards eliminating them. ... And some of these biases run very deep in our local communities maybe generations of families have established these negative values upon our people their family members. So it will take participants on all levels ... to help identify and educate and get people to work through these biases.""

McMahon: ""There must be acknowledgment by all people that those atrocious white mob crimes of the past have never gone away. They've haunted and terrorize generations of people. There must be acknowledgment that systemic racism is a major problem today in this country.

Spiller: ""I think that what my hope and my expectation is of this commission but also of the work that we do in communities is for each of us to actually move into a process of repair that gets us to a moment where we can then begin to at least reimagine what true justice can look like here in our society.""

Doha: Oil settled above $79 a barrel on Friday just shy of a three-year high reached earlier this week on expectations that OPEC ministers will maintain a steady pace in raising supply. Brent crude rose 97 cents or 1.2 percent to settle at $79.28 in its fourth weekly rise. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose 85 cents to settle at $75.88 in a sixth week of gains.

Brent has risen over 50 percent this year and reached a three-year high of $80.75 on Tuesday. OPEC+ is slowly unwinding record output cuts made last year although sources say it is considering doing more to boost production as the group is facing pressure from consumers such as the US and India to produce more to help reduce prices as demand has recovered faster than anticipated in some parts of the world. Oil is also finding support as a surge in natural gas prices globally prompts power producers to move away from gas.

Generators in Pakistan Bangladesh and the Middle East have started switching fuels. US oil rigs rose seven to 428 last week their highest since April 2020 energy services firm Baker Hughes said in its closely followed report on Friday.

Asian liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices surged to a record high last week on sustained demand from China amid a power crunch and high gas prices in Europe as the winter season begins. The average LNG price for November delivery into Northeast Asia was estimated at about $32 per metric million British thermal units (mmBtu) up nearly 20 percent from the previous week industry sources said. Price agency S&P Global Platts said on Thursday that its Japan-Korea-Marker which is widely used as a benchmark for spot LNG contracts rose to $34.47 per mmBtu.

Chinese buyers are seeking more cargoes despite record prices bidding above market rates as the winter season starts with the country’s gas inventory not full trade sources noted. Also US natural gas futures continued their extremely volatile week falling over 4 percent on Friday on growing expectations the United States will have enough gas supplies for this winter after soaring in the prior session to a seven-year high on worries the rest of the world may not have enough fuel this winter. Front-month gas futures for November delivery fell 24 cents to settle at $5.62 per mmBtu.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtoYWxlZWp0aW1lcy5jb20vZW5lcmd5L2Fkbm9jLWRyaWxsaW5nLW1ha2VzLXN1Y2Nlc3NmdWwtZGVidXQtb24tYWR40gFWaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua2hhbGVlanRpbWVzLmNvbS9lbmVyZ3kvYWRub2MtZHJpbGxpbmctbWFrZXMtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bC1kZWJ1dC1vbi1hZHg_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adnoc Drilling makes successful debut on ADX,"The newly-listed unit of Abu Dhabi oil giant Adnoc surged 30 per cent to D3.05 in early trading but later closed at Dh2.95 per share with 242.33 million shares traded on the exchange on debut. — Supplied photo

Published: Sun 3 Oct 2021 4:05 PM Last updated: Sun 3 Oct 2021 9:03 PM

Adnoc Drilling on Sunday began trading on the Abu Dhabi stock market after its $1.1 billion initial public offering (IPO) the largest ever on the exchange.

The newly-listed unit of Abu Dhabi oil giant Adnoc surged 30 per cent to Dh3.05 in early trading but later closed at Dh2.95 per share up 28.26 per cent with 242.33 million shares traded on the exchange on debut.

Adnoc Drilling whose share offering attracted more than $34 billion in demand is expected to be among the 10 largest companies on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange based on a market capitalisation at listing of about $10 billion.

“This important milestone will bolster the expansion and diversification of Abu Dhabi’s equity capital markets and further the development of the UAE’s economy and private sector” Adnoc said in a statement to Khaleej Times.

Adnoc Drilling shares were offered at a price of Dh2.30 per share on September 13 2021 following the issue of an intention to float announcement on September 6 2021 with allocations and confirmation of the pricing on September 27 2021.

Adnoc increased the size of the IPO to 11 per cent of share capital because of oversubscription. It had previously targeted selling a minimum stake of 7.5 per cent.

A value creation

Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Adnoc managing director and Group CEO said Adnoc Drilling’s record-setting listing is another key milestone in the company’s value creation and maximisation strategy.

“Today’s listing will enable domestic and international investors alike to benefit from the growth trajectory of a company that sits at the very heart of Adnoc’s ambitious growth plans” he said.

In addition the minister said this highly successful IPO will further strengthen and broaden Abu Dhabi’s vibrant equity capital markets while driving the UAE’s economic growth diversification and attracting foreign direct investment.

“The significant demand for this offering emphasized by the considerable oversubscription reflects the investment community’s high confidence in Adnoc Drilling and the attractiveness of Adnoc and the UAE as a compelling investment destination” he said.

The overwhelming investor demand for Adnoc Drilling shares underlines the company’s compelling investment and growth story as the largest drilling company in the Middle East by rig fleet size. It is also the sole provider of drilling rig hire services and certain associated rig-related services to Adnoc Group.

A milestone event

Mohammed Ali Al Shorafa Al Hammadi chairman of ADX said the listing of Adnoc Drilling is a milestone event for the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange.

“It will enhance our capital markets and provide a unique opportunity for investors accessing an important and flourishing segment of the emirate’s economy” he said.

Abdulrahman Abdullah Al Seiari CEO of Adnoc Drilling said the success of “our initial public offering and today’s listing” is a huge vote of confidence in Adnoc Drilling.

“Adnoc Drilling is on an upward growth trajectory with a unique contractual relationship with Adnoc and plans to continue to support Adnoc as it delivers on its 2030 growth target to increase oil production capacity to five million barrels per day as well as the UAE’s goal to be gas self-sufficient he said.

Saeed Hamad Al Dhaheri chief executive officer of ADX said the Adnoc Drilling listing is testament to the success the ADX One strategy has had in rapidly delivering a diverse range of products and services.

“The Adnoc Drilling listing will serve to further draw in new investors and issuers and bolstering the exchange’s market capitalisation which exceeded Dh1 trillion for the first time in 2021” he said.

During the year he said ADX’s benchmark index also reached a record high surpassing the 7800-point mark and becoming one of the best-performing indexes in the world this year.

“We will continue to roll out new products and services to deepen market liquidity and access to finance which has been greatly enhanced since the introduction of Q Market Makers in October last year” he said.

Adnoc will continue to own an 84 per cent majority stake in the unit while Baker Hughes will retain its five per cent shareholding. Helmerich and Payne will hold one per cent through its IPO cornerstone investment.

The sale is the second public flotation of a company owned by the Abu Dhabi oil major after the 2017 listing of Adnoc Distribution the largest operator of petrol stations and convenience stores in the UAE.

Up to a quarter of the revenues generated by the constituent companies of exchange traded funds focused on US stocks are derived from sales to China according to research by Bank of America.

The analysis demonstrates how difficult it is for investors to avoid the fallout from Beijing’s crackdown on a swath of private sector activities.

“What happens in China doesn’t stay in China” BofA said with the correlation between earnings per share growth in the US S&P 500 and Chinese economic growth surging from zero in 2010 to 90 per cent exceeding the importance of US gross domestic product growth for US-listed stocks.

About 30 per cent of global GDP growth over the past two decades has come from China greater than the 21 per cent from the US while almost 80 per cent of the S&P 500’s margin expansion since 1990 has been driven by globalisation the bank added.

BofA found that 79 S&P 500 companies generate at least 5 per cent of their revenues from China a figure rising to 63 per cent for casino operator Las Vegas Sands and 70 per cent for rival Wynn Resorts both heavily focused on the Macau gaming market.

Next highest were chipmakers Qualcomm at 60 per cent and Texas Instruments (55 per cent) followed by laser developer IPG Photonics (42 per cent).

Globally it identified 303 listed companies with total market capitalisation in excess of $19tn that generate at least 5 per cent of their revenue from China.

Separate analysis by Jared Woodard head of the research investment committee at BofA found that — based on their holdings of these 303 companies — 138 of the 251 ETFs the bank covers generated at least 3 per cent of their underlying revenue from China.

Apart from China-focused funds emerging market ETFs were the most exposed with their constituents typically deriving between 25 and 45 per cent of their revenues from the country.

However even some ETFs focused purely on US-listed stocks were found to have high exposures led by the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) whose constituents generate 27.9 per cent of their revenues from China according to BofA’s numbers.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) is not far behind at 25.8 per cent with VanEck Low Carbon Energy ETF (SMOG) which tracks a global index at 19.1 per cent and the First Trust Nasdaq 100 Technology Sector Index fund (QTEC) at 16.6 per cent.

“A lot of US companies have built up quite a lot of dependence on revenues from China” Woodard said. “Investors may not be aware. People know the mandates of the funds they buy usually but what they might not know is that companies around the world have become increasingly dependent on China.”

The figures might even understate ETFs’ exposure to China. Some funds will hold companies that derive some revenue from China but less than the 5 per cent threshold used in BofA’s analysis meaning their contribution is missed. In addition not all companies disclose the full geographic breakdown of their sales Woodard said.

The research also only covered revenues emanating from China not other potential vulnerabilities such as supply chains.

“Revenue exposure is something we can measure [but] that is just one reflection of their relationship. [Via] broader trade labour pools there are a host of ways that means economies around the world are more connected than before” Woodard added.

His analysis found that some of the ETFs with little exposure to China have outperformed comparable China-centric funds by as much as 37 percentage points since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020.

The gaps are particularly large for consumer discretionary funds where some ETFs hold China-dependent casino education and luxury stocks while others do not.

The gaps are also notable for funds following an environmental social and governance mantra and those focused on emerging markets.

While every stock market has its ups and downs Woodard argued that China’s current combination of long-term concerns around issues such as demographics and potential growth cyclical headwinds such as tight monetary policy and “political interventions in the name of common prosperity” means “the risk may be greater than the rewards”.

Kenneth Lamont senior fund analyst for passive strategies at Morningstar said the analysis underscored the need for investors to be aware of what is in the funds they hold.

“The geographical location of a company is somewhat arbitrary. It’s not necessarily linked with where it makes its money. Shell and BP are listed in the UK but that’s not where the bulk of their revenues are coming from” Lamont said.

“American companies tend to have a fairly large domestic footprint because they have a large internal market but in a globalised world we are all dependent to some degree on how well China is doing.”

BofA also noted that since 2017 mutual funds had gone from having an equal weight position in the US companies with top decile exposure to China to being more than 10 percentage points underweight.

ETFs being overwhelmingly passive do not have the scope to follow suit even though these stocks trade at near-record 25 per cent premium to their peers according to BofA.

Rahul Sen Sharma managing partner of Indxx an index provider said “only time will tell” whether active managers’ decision to underweight US stocks heavily exposed to China pays off.

“We will have to see how the returns stack up over the long term. Passive investment usually wins out over active” he said.

Lamont agreed saying “next week something might change and these active managers will be caught off guard.

“Sometimes [active management] pays off and sometimes it doesn’t. Maybe it will pay off this time but most active managers don’t make enough calls right over time.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmljaWoub3JnL2ludmVzdGlnYXRpb25zL3BhbmRvcmEtcGFwZXJzL2FsY29nYWwtcGFuYW1hLWxhdGluLWFtZXJpY2EtcG9saXRpY2lhbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When Latin America's elite wanted to hide their wealth they turned to this Panama firm - ICIJ,"One of Central America’s most prestigious law firms Alemán Cordero Galindo & Lee was going into damage control mode again.

The United States had accused managers of a private European bank of accepting exorbitant commissions to help clients launder $4.2 billion in looted money. Those clients included former high-ranking officials of Venezuela’s national oil company an institution rife with corruption in a country in chaos along with others with close government ties.

The firm known as Alcogal had cause to be alarmed: Some of the Venezuelans involved in the scandal were its customers too. It had set up offshore shell companies for them.

Following a well-worn playbook the Panamanian firm quickly assembled a team to handle the emergency and decided to resign as registered agent for many of the companies. Driving the decision: “The impact of the negative news” and “the level of risk that these companies represent due to the people that are part of them” according to an internal Spanish-language report from 2015.

For a high-powered law firm that represents the likes of Citibank and Pfizer creating companies for former members of the Venezuelan government might be considered too great of a risk of inadvertently aiding money laundering.

But Alcogal didn’t come to play a leading role in the tax avoidance and asset protection industry by turning risky clients away.

Alcogal has served figures involved in some of the most notorious corruption scandals in recent Latin American history

Over the past three decades Alcogal has become a magnet for the rich and powerful from Latin America and beyond seeking to hide wealth offshore a massive new leak of corporate records obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists shows. The records are known as the Pandora Papers.

The firm acted as corporate middleman for more than 160 politicians and public officials the records show. Its client roster has included Panamanian presidents a leading presidential contender in next month’s Honduran election the president of Ecuador and even the king of Jordan.

All told nearly half of the politicians whose names appear in the leaked records were tied to Alcogal.

Alcogal has also served figures involved in some of the most notorious corruption scandals in recent Latin American history including the global bribery operation of Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht SA (now known as Novonor) the international soccer corruption scandal known as Fifagate and the alleged looting of Venezuelan public assets.

The Pandora Papers investigation is based on more than 11.9 million confidential records from law firms and offshore services providers. More than two million files came from Alcogal. ICIJ obtained the records and shared them with more than 150 news organizations around the world.

Nearly two years of reporting by more than 600 journalists sheds unprecedented light on a shadowy economy available only to those with the money or connections to access it. Firms like Alcogal propel that economy helping well-heeled clients find havens to conceal their money sometimes from tax collectors and criminal investigators. Ordinary people often pay the price.

The Pandora Papers provide information on more than 14000 offshore entities in Belize the British Virgin Islands Panama and other tax havens created by Alcogal on behalf of more than 15000 customers mostly since 1996.

In a letter to ICIJ Alcogal said that company incorporation “is but one aspect” of its legal services and that it operates in “full compliance with all applicable requirements in every jurisdiction in which we operate.” The firm “performs enhanced due diligence on a client who is determined to be a high-risk customer regardless of the nature of the relationship or service” it said.

Leaked records show Alcogal established more than 200 shell companies in Panama and other jurisdictions at the request of Banca Privada d’Andorra a private bank based in a tiny European principality between France and Spain. Some were later allegedly used to siphon funds in the Venezuelan public corruption scheme the records show.

The U.S. government later blacklisted the bank as a “primary money laundering concern.”

Most of the companies were dissolved and Alcogal resigned from some of them shortly after the blacklisting was made public in 2015.

Also at the request of Banca Privada d’Andorra Alcogal set up two shell companies later allegedly used by Odebrecht to funnel $30 million in bribes to win public works contracts in Panama. Some of the money flowed to the sons of then-Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli whistleblowers testified. The sons were indicted last year and prosecutors recently recommended that Martinelli who has had personal ties to some Alcogal founders be charged as well. The Martinellis deny the allegations.

Records show that in 2000 and 2001 Alcogal registered two companies in the BVI owned by Juan Carlos Varela his brother his father and other associates. Varela served as Martinelli’s vice president and succeeded him as Panama’s president in 2014. Three months into Varela’s presidency an Alcogal internal review came across allegations that his presidential campaign was financed in part by money laundered from illegal online gambling. The review noted that Varela’s campaign denied the allegations which were based on media publications and Alcogal concluded they didn’t require further investigation.

In 2017 Varela admitted that during his vice presidential campaign he received donations from Odebrecht a Brazilian company at the center of one of Latin America’s biggest corruption investigations but he denied that the money was a bribe. Varela told ICIJ that the campaign donations were made in accordance with the law and were reported to electoral authorities.

Panamanian authorities have also recommended that Varela who left office in 2019 be charged in the Odebrecht case.

In 2006 the law firm registered a company in Panama called Karlane Overseas SA. The next year all but one of 10000 shares were transferred to Nasry Juan “Tito” Asfura records show. Asfura then a commissioner of Tegucigalpa is a leading contender for president in the Honduran national election next month.

Last year the Honduran attorney general asked an anti-corruption court to try Asfura who is now the mayor of Tegucigalpa for allegedly embezzling municipal funds but the supreme court decided not to send the case to trial. Through a spokesperson Asfura told ICIJ partners Centro Latinoamericano de Investigación Periodística (CLIP) and Contracorriente that he doesn’t own the offshore company and doesn’t hold offshore investments. The bank that helped Asfura create Karlane told reporters that the company had been used to buy land from Asfura’s family and others in Tegucigalpa to develop a business center there.

Alcogal said it resigned from the companies identified in the Odebrecht investigation and collaborated fully with the authorities. It did not comment on Varela or Asfura or other customers citing confidentiality laws and “ethical duties to our clients.”

Of the Andorran bank it said: “We had no reason whatsoever to suspect that BPA Andorra was providing banking services to some questionable clients.”

For lawyers and financial agents vetting potential clients is supposed to be a top priority. International banking and legal standards require professional firms like Alcogal to carefully weigh the risk that they might inadvertently be aiding money laundering or other crimes before accepting a client in the first place. But at times the records show Alcogal wasn’t certain who actually owned the companies it established. It sometimes allowed banks and other firms that sent business its way to withhold that information trusting that they had done a good job vetting the client.

In 2015 for example British Virgin Islands authorities asked for owner information and due diligence records for a company called Firelli International Limited. Alcogal replied that it was unable to fully comply with the request because it hadn’t collected that information prior to setting up the company. Moreover its intermediary client a bank in Miami wouldn’t turn over needed documents.

Alcogal was able to identify through its records and “external database sources” a prominent shareholder: José María Marín the disgraced former president of the Brazilian Soccer Federation. Marín had been arrested a month earlier in connection to Fifagate a fraud case that involved bribes for rights to major soccer tournaments. Court documents in the U.S. later revealed that he used the shell company’s bank account to receive millions of dollars in bribes. Marín was sentenced to four years in prison in 2018.

Alcogal told ICIJ that it resigned as registered agent from Firelli “in accordance with our policies and applicable law.”

The firm said that it currently doesn’t incorporate companies trusts or foundations for a client who does not reveal the beneficial owner’s identity. New laws in jurisdictions where it operates including the BVI and Panama require it to keep this information on record it said.

Even as it helped maintain a fleet of shell companies for notorious clients Alcogal sought to distance itself from its disgraced former competitor Mossack Fonseca whose leaked records powered ICIJ’s 2016 Panama Papers investigation. After the scandal Alcogal compiled a presentation called “Demystifying the Offshore World” that emphasized reforms and pointed to improved assessments of Panama by international anti-money laundering organizations the new records show.

At a breakfast forum a year later hosted by a BVI trade group Ayana Liburd the head of Alcogal’s BVI affiliate complained that banks were lumping Alcogal and others in the industry with Mossack Fonseca “in the same bucket.”

An ICIJ analysis of Pandora Papers records found that in the wake of the Panama Papers revelations at least 113 companies changed their registered agent from Mossack Fonseca to Alcogal.

‘Honesty is Priceless’

In the early 1980s Jaime Alemán a young attorney and the son of a former Panamanian ambassador to Washington was looking to make a name for himself.

After graduating from Duke University’s law school and working in the legal department at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington D.C. Alemán returned home in 1981 to work for his father’s law firm. But he wasn’t happy about the pay and how long it would take new attorneys like him to move up the corporate ladder according to his 2014 memoir Honesty is Priceless.

The memoir and leaked files convey an ambitious attorney with a fierce work ethic rising at 4 a.m. to read the newspaper answer emails and exercise. Among the files are meticulous notes Alemán wrote to himself as memory aids detailing a new contact’s personal traits or details of an interaction. “I gave him some rum and he was happy. Bring him some more” reads one about a caddy at a Maryland golf club.

After briefly working as a legal counselor to Panamanian president Nicolas Ardito Barletta Alemán in 1985 recruited three other lawyers – Carlos Cordero Anibal Galindo and Jorge Federico Lee and founded Alcogal.

The firm was in the secrecy business from day one.

Alcogal charged its first clients a group of Nicaraguan businesspeople $25000 to set up so-called limited stock companies Alemán wrote in his memoir.

Creating such companies he wrote is a “marvelous business” that allows law firms to collect annual fees for acting as registered agents – a functionary role that has them handling some legal and regulatory documents. Firms could charge additional fees to provide their own employees to appear on incorporation documents as managers Alemán wrote. That way the real owner was hidden from the public.

“The client simply went to Switzerland (or Luxemburg Andorra Hong Kong etc.) opened a numbered bank account for which the beneficiary was a Panamanian corporation which in turn operated totally secretly and had no obligation to pay taxes in either Switzerland or Panama” Alemán explained in his book. “The authorities in the client’s country had no idea these funds existed therefore they could not collect taxes on it.”

What Alemán described is the foundation of the offshore economy: setting up shell companies in low- or no-tax jurisdictions with ownership masked by stand-in directors with no substantive role in the company.

It’s a volume business Alemán wrote. The more companies offshore providers set up the bigger the profits.

It’s also a risky business. Customers seeking secrecy often have something to hide. Such was the case in the 1990s when Alcogal created at least five offshore companies later found to have been used by Augusto Pinochet Chile’s dictator from 1973 to 1990. At the time of his death in 2006 Pinochet was facing charges of crimes against humanity and stealing millions of dollars from public funds.

In court filings Alemán acknowledged that his law firm had set up the companies but said he wasn’t aware at the time that they were connected to Pinochet. Alemán said his firm discovered the connection in 2004 and moved to resign as registered agent. Alcogal has “a very clear policy of not providing services to companies that are possibly linked to illicit activities” he said in a court statement.

High-level connections

Alcogal founders and partners are part of the political class their firm serves. They have moved in and out of Panamanian government and political positions for decades. One founder Galindo was the vice president of Martinelli’s political party Cambio Democratico and a Martinelli presidential advisor. Cordero the “C” in Alcogal is a former vice minister of foreign affairs. Lee the “L” served as a supreme court justice and labor minister. Alejandro Ferrer a partner was minister of foreign affairs commerce minister and an appellate court judge.

Members of Martinelli’s family have been clients of Alcogal since at least the late 1990’s and Martinelli himself was a director in a company set up by the firm.

Then-president Martinelli appointed Alemán to his father’s former post Panama’s ambassador to the U.S. in 2009. By January 2011 he was gone – Alemán says he quit. Martinelli says he fired him.

A few years later Martinelli and Alemán got into an argument at a wedding. News outlets reported that Alemán called the president a thief and corrupt and punched him in the face – Martinelli denies he was punched. The reports turned Alemán into a popular hero among Martinelli’s foes. In his book Alemán said the two later made up. Martinelli said they have a “cordial relationship.”

In 2015 Alcogal reported to BVI authorities that it had created and maintained a company that belonged to Martinelli’s brother-in-law Aaron Ramón Mizrachi Malca after news outlets revealed that the company allegedly helped purchase Israeli-made spy equipment. Martinelli was later indicted for using the gear to intercept communications from opposition politicians and others.

Martinelli is currently on trial charged with monitoring and surveillance without judicial authorization. He denies the allegations and claims he’s a victim of political persecution initiated by Varela his former vice president.

Mizrachi told ICIJ that his company was cleared in the investigation and he was never investigated or charged in the espionage case.

In December 2016 Luiz da Rocha Soares an ex-executive of the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht admitted that his former company had secretly paid $30 million in bribes to two shell companies Pachira Ltd. and Mengil International in order to win public works contracts in Panama. Brazilian media had linked the companies to Martinelli’s sons Luis Enrique Martinelli Linares and Ricardo Alberto Martinelli Linares. One of the brothers – it isn’t clear which one – got $6 million Soares said according to news reports.

A few days later Alcogal severed ties with both companies according to internal compliance memos. It had received information that the companies were used for “illicit activities” the memos said. Alcogal wrote that it “considered” two men for whom it had issued powers of attorney – not the Martinelli brothers – to be the actual owners. In 2017 those two men told Panamanian authorities that Ricardo Martinelli Linares was behind both companies according to news reports.

In July 2020 the Martinelli brothers were arrested in a Guatemalan airport after the U.S. charged them in the Odebrecht scheme. They remain in jail awaiting extradition to the U.S. They deny the allegations.

Referrals from a Pyrenees bank

In the introduction to his memoir Alemán warned that Panama’s “rotten” society “particularly its political class” threatened the future of the country. Social transformation was necessary Alemán argued “to avoid a political economic and social breakdown such as countries like Venezuela face today.”

After the 2013 death of President Hugo Chavez Venezuela further descended into a political crisis fueled by a shortage of food and medicine soaring inflation and crime rates – a crisis that continues. More than 5 million people about 17% of the population have fled the country since 2014 according to a Human Rights Watch report.

Even as Alemán blamed Venezuela’s collapse on corruption and waste the Pandora Papers show his law firm had accepted a string of referrals from Banca Privada d’Andorra to act as the registered agent for offshore companies owned by some of Chavez’s former allies.

BPA was part of a banking market catering to wealthy foreigners. Over time it had expanded into several other countries including Panama. In the offshore world private banks often work closely with service providers since many wealthy clients want their shell companies to have bank accounts.

In 2007 the Andorran bank found Alcogal the firm told ICIJ “as a result of an introduction made by the chairman of a reputable bank which was a client of Alcogal.”

An Alcogal partner Raúl Zúñiga Brid would later serve on the board as an independent director of the Andorran bank’s Panama unit along with BPA’s chief executive Joan Pau Miquel Prats. (Prats was later accused by the Andorran social security office of avoiding taxes by using a shell company created by Alcogal in Panama to divert funds from BPA and pay bonuses to other employees and himself. Alcogal said Zúñiga’s involvement on the board was brief and limited).

Soon after Alcogal’s relationship with BPA began Alcogal registered Lairholt Finance Ltd. in Belize at the Andorran bank’s request. The company was owned according to court records by Javier Alvarado Ochoa who held influential positions in Chavez’s government including deputy minister of electrical development. In 2011 Chavez appointed him president of a unit of the state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela.

A year and a half later records show Alcogal created two companies in Panama – Josland Investments SA and Tristaina Trading SA – for Nervis Villalobos an electrical engineer who had also held high-ranking government positions under Chavez including deputy energy minister. At the time he was working in the private sector as an independent international advisor on energy matters according to his LinkedIn profile.

Then scandal: In March 2015 the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network or FinCEN issued a notice naming BPA among financial institutions of “primary money laundering concern.” Such FinCEN notices known as “blacklisting” are rare and often fatal for a bank.

FinCEN alleged that the Andorran private bankers and their Venezuelan clients worked closely with high-ranking Venezuelan officials and Panamanian registered agents to establish shell companies later used by the Venezuelans to launder looted public funds.

The U.S. agency didn’t identify the registered agents or the names of the shell companies. That information later came out in news reports and indictments.

A day after the FinCEN notice Alcogal resigned as registered agent for some of the companies linked to Venezuelan clients leaked records show. Alcogal continued to cut ties with companies as more news reports tolled out. Records show that by April the firm had produced at least three internal reports related to the matter including one called “Venezuelan characters associated with the regime.”

Villalobos Ochoa and other Venezuelan officials and their relatives were indicted by authorities in Andorra Spain the U.S. and Venezuela.

The Andorran indictment said that Villalobos Ochoa and others took bribes and kickbacks in exchange for favorable treatment to businesspeople seeking contracts with Venezuela’s state-run oil company. The suspects then used bogus contracts claiming they had provided consulting services to justify the source of the funds they were depositing in their BPA accounts according to the allegations. The accounts were controlled through the shell companies.

Authorities allege that the BPA executives involved in the scheme approved the accounts even as its own internal compliance unit raised concerns about their political ties.

Documents obtained by El País show that indicted Venezuelans allegedly used part of the proceeds to live large in Europe spending millions of dollars on luxury items such as wine caviar tailored suits and expensive Parisian hotels.

One receipt shows that Villalobos bought two gold Rolex watches through an account belonging to Josland Investments the Spanish paper reported.

Neither FinCEN nor any other government authority alleged any wrongdoing by Alcogal or any other service provider in connection with the alleged Andorran bank money-laundering scheme.

After Andorran authorities forced a sweeping restructuring of the bank among other measures FinCEN withdrew its blacklisting of BPA.

In its letter to ICIJ Alcogal said it cooperated fully with authorities investigating BPA including sharing information regarding beneficial owners as is its practice when required. It resigned as registered agent from all companies found to be involved in illegal activities it said.

Villalobos and Ochoa live in Spain where they were briefly jailed. U.S. and Spanish authorities have been negotiating for two years over whether the men will be extradited to the U.S. and if so under what terms. Venezuela has also requested their extradition.

Through an attorney Ochoa declined to comment because his case is pending in court. Villalobos whose attorney has denied the allegations in the past didn’t respond to requests for comment from ICIJ.

Diligence concerns

Christodoulos Vassiliades an attorney and Belize’s honorary consul in Cyprus was one of Alcogal’s most prominent and trusted intermediaries. In his book Alemán refers to Vassiliades as “my good friend.” In 2001 records show Alcogal gave Vassiliades’ law firm the option of not submitting certain documents that reveal the true owners and directors of companies and where money flowing into those companies comes from.

In the following years records show Vassiliades brought dozens of clients to the firm including suspected fraudsters and a Russian oligarch and close ally of Vladimir Putin.

Records show that when Alcogal in response to changing rules in the BVI asked Vassiliades’ firm for updated information about the directors of dozens of companies it sometimes had trouble getting it. In 2006 Alemán complained to Vassiliades that he didn’t understand why it had taken almost a year to provide the information – even after he promised it “will be maintained in confidential form in our offices.”

“Dear Chris” Alemán wrote to his friend. “I would appreciate your calling me URGENTLY to discuss this matter. Unless we receive the documents by June 23rd 2006 we will have no choice but to resign as Registered Agents of the 146 companies.” The information started slowly trickling in emails show.

In a statement Vassiliades’ law firm said it couldn’t answer questions about specific clients and that it fully complies with due diligence regulations. It has provided information about beneficial owners for all the companies it has incorporated in the BVI it said.

In 2009 Vassiliades brought a new client to Alcogal: Galina Telesh who was the only director and real owner of Barlow Investing Ltd. a company registered by Alcogal.

Nearly a decade later in 2018 Telesh moved to dissolve the company. Only then did Alcogal file a suspicious activities report with BVI authorities alerting them to the fact that she was the ex-wife of the notorious gangster Semion Mogilevich known as the “boss of bosses” of the Russian mafia. He was included on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list for six years until he was located in Russia in 2015.

Vassiliades’ firm said it rejects “any allegations that we have any connection” whether directly or indirectly to criminal organizations.

Alcogal said it immediately cut ties with Barlow when instructed to do so “by its professional intermediary.”

In a statement to ICIJ the Panamanian regulator that oversees firms that provide offshore services said that the government had made “many effective and concrete” steps in the last few years to fight tax evasion and money laundering. Along with new requirements for offshore firms to identify beneficial owners of companies they set up the government has suspended nearly half of the 762709 corporations in its public registry the statement said.

Under suspicion

Suspicious activity reports like the one Alcogal filed on Telesh are required of providers in most jurisdictions when they suspect a client may be linked to criminal activity.

Authorities favor proactive reports: filed before a service provider completes a transaction or activity rather than after a shell company has been used in a crime. A BVI Financial Investigation Agency presentation found in Alcogal’s leaked documents says that proactive reports help minimize the risk of money laundering. Reactive reports “add minimal value to investigations to have any helpful effect.”

Time after time the records show the law firm submitted suspicious activity reports only after its clients had been exposed by authorities or journalists as possibly corrupt or involved in other crimes.

An ICIJ analysis of the suspicious activity reports filed by Alcogal in Panama the Bahamas and BVI between 2007 and 2018 shows that the overwhelming majority 87 of 109 were “reactive.” More than half of Alcogal’s reports came in the wake of ICIJ’s Panama Papers investigation alone.

ICIJ’s analysis shows that between January 2017 and May 2018 Alcogal filed 16 suspicious activity reports related to people connected to the Odebrecht corruption case or an earlier related case known as Lava Jato.

Alcogal was the registered agent for several companies owned by Paulo Roberto Costa a former director of procurement at Brazil’s state oil company known as Petrobras.

In 2014 Costa confessed he had laundered nearly $26 million in bribes for his participation in bid rigging to favor Odebrecht and other companies. To move the money to Swiss bank accounts Costa used shell companies registered in Panama including two for which Alcogal acted as registered agent court records show.

Alcogal said that it prepares suspicious activity reports in compliance with local legislation. If it comes across “negative information” about a company or client such as having been suspected or charged of a crime “we proceed with the appropriate course of action ranging from obtaining disclaimers to resigning as Registered Agents and/or filing SARs as applicable on a case-by-case basis” it told ICIJ. High-risk clients are reviewed more frequently than low-risk ones it said.

“We understand that compliance is one of the main pillars of the provision of our international corporate services” the firm said.

At a getting-to-know-you meeting with BVI regulators in 2013 Alemán told them that keeping up with compliance was a chore. “It is impossible to have perfect files” he said according to minutes of a meeting in the leaked documents. “We have over 10000 active companies. It is a huge challenge to monitor.”

Alemán acknowledged that the firm did not have ownership information on all of the companies his firm set up and represented as registered agents. Even so he said he was confident that the firm had the bulk of required client information in its files.

“Best test – I sleep well at night even though our files aren’t perfect.”

It’s true. Despite the push in some sectors for a cashless society and a rise in the use of virtual currency cash and cash equivalent still play a crucial role in governments and in banking and financial sectors all over the globe. That’s become increasingly clear when it comes to transactions that impact tax reporting and compliance.

Not convinced? Just look at the push to stop a measure under consideration in Congress as part of the reconciliation package that would require banks to hand over some account information to the Internal Revenue Service. It made the rounds on social media and in water coolers as taxpayers worried about handing over their bank information.

The way that we bank is changing. Declining activity in the underlying unsecured bank funding market together with the attempted manipulation from interbank lending rate panel banks have resulted in global regulators working on a transition roadmap from interbank offered rates (IBORs) to alternative reference rates (ARRs). In Addressing the Challenges of the IBOR Transition Under the Arm’s-Length Principle Marco Striato of GPBL—Gatti Pavesi Bianchi Ludovici considers the potential transfer pricing impact of the transition from interbank offered rates and discusses what multinational enterprises should be aware of when addressing the transfer pricing challenges.

In September the IRS announced that it will no longer issue private letter rulings on whether someone with substantial ties to a foundation can “wrap” a note to the foundation in an LLC to avoid self-dealing penalties. In IRS Won’t Rule on Wrapping Disqualified Person’s Note to Foundation in LLC Richard L. Fox of Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney explains how wrapping a note works and advises caution in such a transaction unless certain conditions are met.

Cash may no longer be king. Retail stores have struggled as a result of Covid-19 making it more important for stores to find liquidity and new ways to engage customers and strengthen supply chains. In Can the Tax Code Help the Upended Retail Sector? Ajay Wanchoo and Gregory Bocchino of KPMG LLP highlight how the retail industry can take advantage of federal and state research and experimentation credits to rebound from the pandemic.

While cash in hand is nice planning for future revenues could pay off. The pandemic has created a price gap between optimistic sellers who believe the economic recovery is imminent and more pessimistic buyers according to Evan Levine and Nainesh Shah of Complete Advisors. In An Introduction to Earnout Structures For Your Next Deal they describe several aspects of earnouts—opportunities for sellers to receive additional payments based on future performance—-and how they affect valuation for estate and income tax purposes.

One goal of the second pillar of the OECD’s global tax reform proposals is to ensure that certain multinational businesses pay a minimum level of tax. But are taxpayers already thinking about ways to get around it? In Hybrid Financial Instruments Might Reduce Impact of Pillar Two Proposals Lee Hadnum of Bloomberg Tax & Accounting considers how hybrid financial instruments could potentially be used by multinational enterprises to manipulate their effective tax rate and significantly reduce the impact of the Pillar Two proposals.

The Pillar One and Pillar Two proposals are being pitched as global solutions but will certainly impact individual countries. In BEPS 2.0: Global Measures and Their Impact for Portugal Rogério M. Fernandes Ferreira of RFF & Associados looks at the potential impact for Portugal’s tax revenue and fiscal competitiveness.

What exactly constitutes presence for tax purposes continues to be a theme around the world. In European Court of Justice Clarifies Concept of VAT Fixed Establishment Aiki Kuldkepp of Grant Thornton Netherlands discusses recent significant decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union which have clarified the concept of a fixed establishment for VAT purposes.

And the U.S. isn’t the only country scrambling to pass a budget deal. In September the National Assembly of Ecuador took the first look at a proposal from President Guillermo Lasso. In Ecuador: Agreements and Reforms to Reactivate the Economy Diego Andrés Almeida and Cesar Molina of Almeida Guzmán & Asociados consider the measures already taken by the new government as well as proposed future tax reforms intended to make Ecuador more attractive to investment.



Opinion and Commentary

Banks have been speaking out against a congressional proposal that would increase reporting requirements. But is that a good idea? In Banks Are Wrong to Fight New IRS Disclosure Charles Ellis and Alexander Boyle write that the key to enforcement is better-targeted audits not just more of them. And the key to more effective audits they claim is information.

And speaking of Congress what else is in the spending bill? In Is Biden’s Economic Plan Actually a Good Idea? Tyler Cowen writes that there has been remarkably little policy debate about it and remarkably little attempt to persuade the American public that this spending is a good idea.

One of the pieces that didn’t make it into the congressional proposals is the stepped-up basis at death. In To Reform Stepped-Up Basis at Death Focus on Tax Shelter Recharge Gavin Landgraf talks about capital gains tax forgiveness and what he has labeled “tax shelter recharge.”

The plan to increase taxes for the wealthiest Americans includes limiting some juicy retirement tax breaks. In The High-Earner Tax Break That Democrats Forgot Alexis Leondis wonders why Congress isn’t targeting cash balance plans. For lawmakers who say they want to tighten the menu of tax breaks for well-off people who are already saving for retirement she says these plans would seem to be low-hanging fruit.

From hacks to best practices hearing what tax professionals have to say about how they achieve success at the office can be valuable. Our Friday networking minute allows you to share your tips on life in the profession.

Last week’s question was:

What is your favorite tax job interview question?

Enrolled Agent Adam Markowitz says: “My favorite question that I asked all of my interviewees for my job is what scared them most about taking a position with my firm.” He explains that there are lots and lots of correct answers and “Nothing isn’t one of them.”

Firm owner and Enrolled Agent James Upton echoed a few tax professionals—including me—by asking a variation on “What is your favorite code section other than 179 and why?”

And I immediately thought of Bloomberg Industry Group Executive Editor Paul Albergo with this “good old fun one”: If you were given a choice to be a superhero would you choose Batman or Superman?

The city was founded in the first century by the Romans who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva goddess of healing is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.

At the Cleveland Pools however you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984. Following a nearly £10-million restoration the complex believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom reopened to the public in the fall. Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.

Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon medieval and Tudor architecture and most notably neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow even in the pouring rain.

The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath population 100000 sees a significant influx of visitors particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here briefly) and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.

Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties which is why during my visit in October I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.

Open this photo in gallery: Holburne Museum Bath's first public art gallery and former home of Sir Thomas Holburne.

At its east end is the Holburne Museum. Doubling as the stately residence of Bridgerton’s formidable Lady Danbury in real life it’s the onetime home of Sir Thomas Holburne a lifelong collector of quirky miniatures old masters and objets d’art he later bequeathed to the city. A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.

Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus a round residential street of townhouses from 1754 is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning. Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop the Featherington family’s abode).

The Assembly Rooms referenced by Austen was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre those ghosts are in fact real-life guides costumed in Regency garb who lead tours in character.

Open this photo in gallery: Berdoulat’s apothecary fixtures are bursting with history-inflected housewares

All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural design practice which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.

The wood countertops brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.

As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new DeVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops Shaker wainscotting aged brass taps slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.

Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads. The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric for example lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.

Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists she created Cereal an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.

Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation its hours are limited but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vc3BvcnQvcnVnYnktdW5pb24vYXJ0aWNsZXMvY3cwdmxlMW41cnJv0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9zcG9ydC9ydWdieS11bmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy9jdzB2bGUxbjVycm8uYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Premiership: Newcastle Falcons 17-28 Bath,"It was a fast start by Bath who went over for the first time inside five minutes. Prop Du Toit scooped the ball up before forcing his way over with Finn Russell adding the conversion.

Nine minutes later Bath scored again but this time it needed checking. Du Toit fell short of the line but the ball found Spencer. The officials looked to see if there was a knock-on in the build-up but the try stood and was converted from close range.

Bath looked to be running away with it when Cokanasiga powered over in the right corner on 28 minutes before another Russell conversion.

The Falcons got on the board when Blamire forced himself over the line following a superb maul near the corner but Brett Connon's conversion fell just short.

Gallagher scythed through the Newcastle defence on 38 minutes and secured a bonus point with another converted try.

Blamire responded to end the half with his second following another driving maul. Again Connon failed to convert.

The frenetic pace to the match did not cease after the break; Newcastle were not letting go of the slim chance of a first victory in over a year and their scrum which had been dominant all night maintained their foothold in the game.

Stuart's try came after another strong drive as Newcastle made their superior territory and possession count.

In truth Bath's discipline gave Newcastle hope of a comeback as the latter stages were littered with penalties but they managed to hold on for the win.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDI0LTA1LTA5L2Zvcm1lci1iZWQtYmF0aC1zdWVzLWh1ZHNvbi1iYXktZm9yLTMwMC1taWxsaW9uLXRyYWRpbmctZ2FpbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Bed Bath & Beyond Sues Hudson Bay for $300 Million in Trading Profits,"The former Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. seeking to generate cash for its creditors sued to recover more than $300 million in trading profits from Hudson Bay Capital Management the hedge fund at the center of a last-ditch financing plan that failed to prevent the retailer’s collapse.

The global day is designed to celebrate techies or tech-savvy people but also sets out to encourage young people to consider careers in technology and promote jobs in tech.

With that in mind we asked a bunch of Australian tech founders two questions to mark National Techies Day: for their advice to the next generation of techies and what they love most about the job.

Here’s what they said:

Things have changed significantly over the last 20 years. When I was coming into telco industry it was dominated by two to three major players and there’s now been a lot of other entries. Things have changed where there are many different successful operators in the industry – there are more opportunities and people which is exciting.

At some point in my career in my early thirties  I realised that I got more enjoyment from watching other people learn things and achieve things than I did than achieving them myself. Now as a tech leader and CEO it allows me to watch other people and their careers grow. There’s several thousands of people that have worked for me over the last 20 years or so and some of them in very successful positions. I’m proud of the fact that I got to at least be part of the journey.

My career has gone from starting in computer engineering because computer games were fun as a teenager and then realising that computer engineering has nothing to do with computer games. From there I moved and got a job in construction at Telstra then worked my way up. I then found people I enjoyed working with and even now I’m constantly learning every day.”

With technology moving extremely quickly  try and always stay relevant so you have to keep learning. Just because you’re a student now don’t think that once you finish university or other studies it stops.

I think that the companies that really thrive will be focused on innovation sustainable culture and tackling complex technology and social issues. The idea of legacy technology with vendor lock-in should be gone and there will be nimble tech companies that challenge major incumbents.

The best part of the job is having the freedom to dream big and execute on them. I work with brilliant people and wonderful customers so setting my own boundaries for my company and pioneering new technology that enables better consumer outcomes powers my passions to build and bring tech to market.

I encourage more students to follow a career in this industry as tech transcends all industries so having capabilities to deliver technology opens doors to most companies that they can work at. It also is cross-border – I know so many people who have moved across the world with their technology careers with those being in demand worldwide.

My advice to the next generation is I’d recommend to shadow people and have internships during university. Having work experience really shapes what you’re exposed to and lots of roles or jobs that you didn’t know existed. I had five internships in university and it had me end up in a totally different place. I thought I’d like one career and turned out I didn’t like it at all and found my real calling as a product developer in tech.

Tim Fung

Co-Founder and CEO Airtasker

For the next generation I’m going to borrow and paraphrase some advice from Jack Ma (founder of Alibaba) related to getting started in tech:

When you are 20-30 years old follow a good boss and join a good company to learn how to do things properly

When you are 30-40 years old if you want to do something yourself just do it

When you’re 40 to 50 years old do things you are good at

When you are 50 to 60 years old spend time developing the next generation

The best thing about working in tech is it’s an opportunity to change the way things work and have a positive impact on the community whilst building something of value. It’s also awesome to get to work side-by-side with some of the brightest minds in the world.

Aaron Beashel

My advice to the next generation of tech employees is to seek out employment from a tier 1 technology company (Think Canva SafetyCulture Campaign Monitor Qwilr Culture Amp Deputy etc.) early in your career.

These places are full of very smart very experienced people who have seen the movie before and you’ll learn so much from simply being involved in these companies seeing how they work and being around the people in them.

Then once you’ve spent a few years learning the ropes and have time at a tier 1 company on your resume you’ll be in a highly employable position where you’ll have your pick of which companies to work for and be able to ask for a very lucrative salary.

I would say the best part of working in tech is the people you get to work with. By comparison to other industries tech is a high-performance industry and the majority of people who work for tech companies are ambitious intelligent people who are great at their jobs and want to grow and excel. This is a result of many factors about the industry but the fact that tech companies are generally well funded and/or highly profitable is certainly a big one.

Most tech companies also offer very enjoyable working environments. The competition for talent is strong and many companies have a heavy focus on providing great cultures nice offices and numerous benefits (including chef catered meals free drinks etc).

Finally if you work for a tech company with multiple offices around the world you will likely have the opportunity to travel or move overseas with your company which can be an exciting adventure that allows you to see new places extend your network and have amazing experiences.

Noelle Kim

My advice for the next generation is get in as early as possible doing whatever job you can.

Industry experience is key and the longer you spend developing your functional expertise elsewhere the less employable you are for the tech job you want. That is not to say there isn’t talent in other industries.

I have had incredible team members who came in as seniors without any tech experience but there are less people who are willing to give you a go.

The best thing about working in tech is you get to solve and tackle some of the world’s most challenging problems. That gets me up every morning. You can draw on everything you have ever learned and apply it to a novel challenge as there is no playbook.

But the better bit: You get to work with incredibly smart people who have a can-do mindset and are optimistic about the future.

Chris Ridd

Tech investor

Giving advice to the next generation of techies makes me feel a bit old but here goes.

My #1 piece of advice would be to pursue opportunities that offer purpose and not just more dollars. In a market that is starved for top talent I am seeing developers (in particular) leaving great companies in pursuit of bigger paychecks.

The age old saying of “the grass is always greener” should be considered here.

That’s not to say of course that you should not seek out bigger and better gigs but in doing so you should also ensure that the next move offers purpose and fulfils you over and above just the remuneration. Ticking that box will go a long way to achieving success and happiness.

My other piece of advice is to invest in yourself in your learning and development and in your network. One of the fallouts from this post-Covid world is a disconnected workplace environment.

The days of structured hands-on-training in the office and personal mentorships are under threat as the office environment is transformed. A lot of learning will become self-directed. Social connections that occur through random professional interactions in and outside of the office will be less frequent.

Technology can only do so much in filling that gap. Ensuring that you maintain professional development as well as human connections outside of Slack Teams and Zoom will be important in your development.

The best thing about working in tech is the constant change. The speed in which things can happen.

For me being part of tech startups like Xero where we went from 6 staff to 320 in 5 years was an absolute blast. There are endless opportunities and new global tech brands are just waiting to be discovered. Who wouldn’t want to be a part of that?

Travis Gandy

Chief Operating Officer Compass Education

Startups are an amazing place to grow your career – the opportunities you get and the things you experience you would never get to see or do in an established organisation.

The most important advice I have is to say yes to everything even if it’s not in your original career plan you can end up in amazing places doing interesting things. I was an accountant before my time at Compass I have run managed services teams sales support and mergers and acquisitions.

The next thing is to keep up-to-date with what’s happening in the industry that doesn’t mean you need to jump on the newest tech as soon as it comes out or know exactly how it works but sometimes the existing tool you have isn’t the best way to solve the problem.

And finally get your hands dirty – some of the best experiences I’ve had in my career have been helping our clients or our team with something that was very much “not my job” – but what I have learned about walking in someone else’s shoes has been invaluable.

The people I work with are amazing and have to be the best thing about working in tech. They’re intelligent and continuously push the boundaries on what’s possible.

Tech at its very core is constantly changing that’s what makes it exciting. The challenges we are dealing with today are completely different to 3 years ago.

Tech has so much flexibility when it comes to career options and it’s experience that translates into a global industry.

Steve Baxter

Founder and CEO Mandoe Media

My advice for the next generation is that if you are aiming to lead a startup one day then practice your pitching skills.

Many excellent ideas will go by the wayside if you can’t raise the capital to invest in them. Practice pitching use your friends or family as an audience get coaching it’s a great life skill even if you never end up using it in a corporate setting.

On the best thing about working in tech is that it’s one of the only industries where if you get something right you can replicate it at scale very quickly and have an oversized impact on people right around the world.

It’s powerful and it’s insane to be on that ride.

Rob Gashi

Chief Growth Officer Adventus.io

My advice is that understanding purpose is so important – make sure you’re clear on what you’re building why you’re doing it and who it’s for.

A big part of this is ensuring you don’t jump at new tech before you understand what works and what doesn’t with what you are trying to achieve.

On the best thing about working in tech is constantly evolving and as a result it’s the best place to learn but you have to get comfortable with change.

It’s very flexible as a sector – you can choose to work on your own or in a team you have the ability to follow developing interests and can work across an array of verticals – from education to finance and beyond.

Brett Herkt

Co-Founder and CEO BoardPro

Technology is rich with opportunity. Back in 2011 Marc Andreessen coined the phrase “software is eating the world”.

Today four of the five most valuable companies in the world are tech companies. It’s just a superb opportunity to be on the cutting edge of creativity and growth.

A great way to find excellent places to work is to follow what the major tech investors are investing in.

You can get started with Bessemer’s annual state of the cloud .

The best part of the job is the opportunity for learning and applying the latest technologies while working in dynamic high-growth companies.

So many high-growth early stage companies are fighting a shortage of talent across multiple disciplines from developers to UX specialist to product managers which means there’s unlimited opportunity to grow and develop a career with real opportunity and wealth too.

Lee Hardham

Founder and CEO at Brauz

I’m excited for our next generation of tech entrepreneurs and the future of technology in general.

The current generation of techies or my generation have seen and experienced so much change since we started out.

From technological advances to immense cultural shifts and even tackling climate change and the social disconnect from the pandemic there is a lot that the next generation can take away from our learnings.

For one always dream big. If you have a dream for a better world don’t ever think you’re too small to make that dream a reality. The second is to test first build second. As you develop the future stay in touch with the present. Talk to your market and build the future together.

And lastly but most importantly is persistence. There will be many barriers that will bring you down stay persistent go back to step two – test and find a way.

For me and the team at Brauz the best part of being involved in the tech industry has been creating the future and seeing the successful impact that our technology has had on the market today.

Technology is exciting it’s a team effort but it’s also challenging.

Personally I love seeing our vision come to life but I love it even more when I see the looks of achievement across our team and customers. That’s the best part of sharing in the creation of success.

It’s the sense of pride after building something together that’s never been done before.

Alex Kok

Engineering Director SiteMinder

There has never been a more dynamic time to be a techie and on National Techies Day I’m thrilled to be part of a growing team of innovators at SiteMinder that’s constantly pushing the boundaries as the industries we serve evolve and mature in their digital needs. For me this reflects the best part of being in the tech industry – being constantly challenged to expand my skills and my team’s capabilities and being agile as we test new innovations and ideas.

But a workplace like this isn’t common. In fact for those starting out in the tech industry this trifecta of education exposure and experience is what I would encourage you to test potential employers on before jumping on board. Question them on their approach to both formal and on-the-job training buddy programs how their tech teams are exposed to processes and projects in other departments and how your career will be stretched by the tasks at hand so that your resume is constantly lengthening. Andrew Wells Engineering Director of Site Reliability and DevOps Render It’s easy for a developer to just focus on software apps and the cloud as they are really interesting and cool. But it is important that you learn and understand the interplay between how hardware works with the code you write. This will make you better at both development and troubleshooting your work.As for the best thing about the role it’s the networking. You end up meeting people from different industries counties and cultures and connecting via your shared experience and passion for technology.

Alex Frolov

Co-founder and CEO HypeAuditor

When the global pandemic brought the world to its knees we’ve seen an unprecedented reliance on technology an acceleration in digital transformation as well as a boom in the tech-powered entrepreneurship economy.

The potential of technology and its rapid evolution is endless and now more than ever is a prime time for the next generation of techies to set up camp into the tech sector.

My advice for the new techies is to find a mentor who has years of experience in the industry to help guide advise and navigate the tech sector and help identify the area you’d like to specialise in. Australia continues to face an IT skills and talent shortage and adopting a career in tech is a sure fire way to futureproof a livelihood against any disruption.

Technology has the power to be the driving force to change the world for the better. After having worked in the technology sector for more than 12 years I decided to set up a company that I can be proud of and that can change the face of an entire industry. HypeAuditor is not just a set of tools for effective Influencer Marketing (IM) but the embodiment of the desire to elevate and move the entire industry forward to make IM more transparent fair and effective and help brands develop fraud-free IM campaigns.

It is also an industry that keeps you on your toes as it is constantly evolving and you are learning everyday which is great.",,,,,,,,,,,,

He also dedicated himself to philanthropy and focused much of his giving on his hometown including major donations to the University of Nebraska Omaha and the Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium.

In Nebraska ""our problem is we can’t move any mountains here or any oceans here"" Mr. Scott told the New York Times in 1998. ""We’re stuck on the prairie. So we’re going to have to make the most of what we have.""

Mr. Scott who died Sept. 25 at the age of 90 served as chief executive of what is now Kiewit Corp. a builder of highways tunnels and other projects from 1979 to 1998. He diversified the company with investments in telecommunications and energy.

Mr. Scott later was chairman of Level 3 Communications Inc. a Kiewit spinoff that built a fiber-optic network to carry internet traffic. Level 3 was a hot stock in the late 1990s but then floundered amid a glut of long-distance fiber transmission capacity.

He was a longtime director of Mr. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and allied himself with the famed Omaha investor to move more deeply into energy utilities. Berkshire Hathaway and Mr. Scott helped lead a 1999 acquisition of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co.—a supplier of electric power and natural gas based in Des Moines Iowa—for about $2 billion. That business later was expanded and renamed Berkshire Hathaway Energy.

Largely because of his stake in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Mr. Scott had a net worth of $4.2 billion Forbes estimated.

Walter Scott Jr. the grandson of an immigrant carpenter from Dundee Scotland was born May 21 1931 and grew up in Omaha. His father was chief engineer at Peter Kiewit Sons’ Inc. a construction company founded in 1884.

At age 14 Mr. Scott earned the rank of Eagle Scout. He made money for college with summer jobs on an Oregon ranch and later at Kiewit construction sites. At Colorado State University he initially planned to study range management but switched to civil engineering after a friend told him it would mean better career opportunities.

He married a high school sweetheart Carolyn Falk in 1952 and graduated from Colorado State in 1953.

He served briefly in the Air Force then rejoined Kiewit.

While raising his children Mr. Scott moved his family to 17 job sites in a dozen years. He was named chairman and chief executive in 1979 succeeding Peter Kiewit the son of a company founder.

In 2010 Mr. Scott was among 40 families and individuals who signed the Giving Pledge  a campaign organized by Bill and Melinda French Gates and Mr. Buffett to encourage wealthy people to donate the bulk of their fortunes.

Mr. Scott had four children with his first wife Carolyn Falk Scott who died of cancer in 1983. In 1987 he married Suzanne Marshall a former elementary school teacher who had been executive director of the Omaha Zoo Foundation. She died in 2013.

Among the Scotts’ many donations to the zoo was funding for a penguin exhibit.

A profile of Mr. Scott published by the Horatio Alger Association quoted him as having given this advice to his children: ""The greatest thing you can do in life is to be a giver because the world already has plenty of takers.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXVndXN0aW5lLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tYXJrZXRwbGFjZS9yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS8yMDIxLzEwLzAyL2JlcmtzaGlyZS1oYXRoYXdheS1wcm9tb3Rlcy1saW5kYS1saW5kZW5tb3llci81OTA1MzEwMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Berkshire Hathaway promotes Linda Lindenmoyer,"From Staff Reports

As 2021 enters its final quarter the luxury home market remains strong with 15 homes on the public market worth $11 million and higher and 11 at $12.5 million and up but Realtors are optimistic some sales will go through by the end of the year.

“That’s a place where we’ve never been” said luxury Realtor Ivan Sher with the Ivan Sher Group of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties. “In the past from 2019 backward we may have sold one home over $11 million a year or one every other year. It’s a whole different market. There’s demand for this product and as long as it’s not an overpriced home some of these should turn by the end of the year.”

Although not in that price range there’s one high-profile estate on the market that was owned by the late tech entrepreneur Tony Hsieh at 1250 Shadow Lane. It measures 14336 square feet and is in the Scotch 80s community near Charleston Boulevard. It was built in 1977 and is listed for $2 million.

The Hsieh estate sits on 1.75 acres and has a main two-story home with seven bedrooms and 15 bathrooms. There’s a two-car garage with a 600-square-foot apartment above it. There’s also a carriage house with two to three additional bedrooms kitchen living room and family room. The estate has an indoor heated pool in its own building. The property has a three-car garage and three-car carport with recreational vehicle parking.

Listing agent Avi Dan-Goor with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices said the front of the home “has amazing curb appeal with electric gates circular drive and beautiful double wood door front entry with a gorgeous chandelier greeting you at the door.”

The estate has a rose garden fountains and lush landscape. Dan-Goor said he has gotten two offers on the home in the past week with a lot of interest from out of state. One couple from Hawaii wanted it as a compound and others wanted to rebuild on the site he said.

“It’s a very eclectic old Vegas property” Dan-Goor said. “It’s not move-in ready. It needs to be updated and remodeled. But that acreage is hard to find especially in that area.”

The Scotch 80s neighborhood has homes “that are full of character” Dan-Goor said. “It’s a mix of older custom homes on fairly large lots. No two homes are alike. It’s close to the Strip and downtown and has a lot of old Vegas charm to it. It doesn’t feel like the cookie-cutter Summerlin and Green Valley area.”

Many of the people who live there grew up in Las Vegas and love that authentic style Dan-Goor said. It also appeals to people from out of state who don’t want a master-planned community he said.

Most expensive homes on market

1. The list is led by 2738 Carina Way in Seven Hills overlooking Rio Secco golf course. The home is listed for $32.5 million. It has four bedrooms with 14207 square feet of livable area over three stories and 26416 square feet under the roof. It has nine bathrooms and three climate-controlled garages with space to accommodate up to 12 vehicles. It even has a car lift to bring the vehicle to the second-floor master bedroom.

“There’s been lots of activity” said Sher the listing agent. “We’re very selective who goes through it. We’ve had some offers. There’s a lot going on.”

2. The former Wayne Newton estate 6629 Pecos Road remains on the market and is listed for $27.4 million. The 39-acre gated ranch with a seven-bedroom mansion has seven additional homes and an air-conditioned car museum holding more than 100 cars. The estate has horse stalls and breeding stables with an equestrian pool. There are artesian wells and lakes tennis courts and koi ponds with fountains.

“The property currently has multiple offers and we are working with the attorneys to finalize the deal” said listing agent Zar Zanganeh broker and owner of Luxe Estates &Lifestyles. “We are hopefully going to open escrow with one of these offers. It is hoped that it will close by the end of the year.”

3. The mansion at 677 Boulder Summit in MacDonald Highlands in Henderson is on the market for $18 million. It sits on 2 acres and overlooks DragonRidge Country Club. It has more than 14000 square feet with a resort-style backyard two swimming pools spa and seven waterfalls with a Ben Hogan replica bridge from Augusta National Golf Club. There are 16-foot ceilings a chef’s kitchen wine cellar grotto cocktail bar 12-seat theater game room and wellness wing with spa steam sauna and gym. The home has two offices with five guest bedrooms and a master suite. It has a seven-car garage.

Realtor Amelia Prentice-Keene with Keller Williams Southern Nevada said they’ve had some “great interest from overseas. With lots $2 million to $3 million up in that area to have three lots is becoming increasingly rare.”

Overseas buyers have the money for such big purchases and $18 million is nothing to them Prentice-Keene said.

“I think we will see something in the next two to three months” Prentice-Keene said. “In the past a lot of times luxury homes over the $5 million to $10 million mark take a year or two.”

4. The estate at 9409 Kings Gate Court in Queensridge is owned by Yohan Lowie the developer of One Queensridge Place condos and Tivoli Village. It’s an European-style estate on more than 1.5 acres dubbed Villa Piedra (House of Stone) measuring more than 17000 square feet with seven bedrooms. The single-story home built in 2005 is listed for $16 million.

The home has a seven-car garage 2700-square-foot grand living room with 30-foot ceilings lanai library movie theater and detached casita. Anthony Spiegel of the Ivan Sher Group of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices is the listing agent.

“It’s a unique property in a unique neighborhood” Spiegel said. “From what I find from a trend perspective there’s a lot of focus on the modern aesthetic and design and that’s why you have the valuations you do in The Summit Club and The Ridges and MacDonald Highlands where a lot of people gravitate to the desert-contemporary look. This has a more traditional palazzo aesthetic. It’s not the in-demand aesthetic. When you take that the size and location it takes a unique buyer. These traditional neighborhoods just don’t get the kind of activity that the focus on the newer neighborhoods gets. We get activity but someone really has to be comfortable with 18000 square feet in a traditional style in a traditional neighborhood.”

Spiegel said given a good economy it could take six more months to sell after going on the market about five months ago. It would have taken more than 18 months in the past he said.

5. More homes from The Summit Club in Summerlin are going on the market including one at 10951 Stardust Drive listed for $15.4 million. Sher is the listing agent for the two-story home that which was designed by architect R. Douglas Mansfield with interiors by Ohara Davies Getano.

“There is a lot of activity” Sher said. “It’s only been on the market for a short period of time and I expect that one will sell by the end of the year.”

There was already a private sale — not listed on the MLS — at The Summit Club for $17.5 million Sher said. “Mine is the only public listing in the Summit right now” Sher said. “It’s a sensational home. The finishes are impeccable. Everyone that walks through that house is awed by the finishes.”

6. The two-story home at 5 Rockstream Drive in Ascaya in Henderson is listed for $13.9 million and measures 6539 square feet with five bedrooms and six bathrooms. It has a 70-foot infinity-edge pool with a spa and indoor and outdoor wet bar. It has a seven-hole putting green fire pit lounge and outdoor kitchen. The great room has a 27-foot ceiling.

8. A home under construction at 3 Heavens Edge Court by Sun West Custom Homes is among the top 10. It’s listed for $13.5 million. When completed it will have 9589 square feet with seven bedrooms. The contemporary single-story home in the hillsides of Ascaya sits on 2.5 acres and has a casita that can serve as an exercise room. The home has a study game room and six-car garage.

It’s a sensational home.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9waGlsaXBwaW5lcy1wZXRzLXJlY2VpdmUtYmxlc3NpbmdzLWRyaXZlLTExNTkxMTIxMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philippines pets receive blessings in drive-through ceremony,"By Adrian Portugal

MANILA (Reuters) - Hundreds of animal lovers in the Philippines had their pets blessed via a drive-through ceremony on Sunday to mark World Animal Day and the feast of Saint Francis of Assisi the patron saint of animals forgoing the usual fanfare due to COVID-19.

This was the second straight year that organisers had to hold a drive-through ceremony to mark World Animal day - celebrated worldwide to recognise animal rights and welfare - to ensure the safety of the animals and owners.

The Philippines has recorded more than 2.5 million COVID-19 cases and more than 38000 deaths and is one of Asia's worst-affected countries in terms of casualties and economic losses.

Among those who patiently waited in the long queue of vehicles was Maxine Mariano who brought Cookie her seven-year old Shih Tzu to receive a blessing from the priest who sprayed and sprinkled holy water on her beloved pet.

""We believe that it's for the long life also of our dog and then also as Catholics it's important to have them blessed as well just like us"" Mariano said through the window of her car.

More than 500 animals of different shapes and sizes were blessed during the ceremony.

Atelier Sophie 2 has not yet been officially announced though its existence was previously leaked via the Australian Classification board last month. The formal announcement will almost certainly be at Koei Tecmo's TGS stream taking place soon at 20:00 JST.

Perhaps Atelier Sophie 2 will be the first Atelier series title to receive a simultaneous worldwide launch but we'll have to wait for the formal announcement for more details.

Best Buy's gallery and product description can be found below.

Atelier Sophie 2: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream continues the story of Sophie and Plachta’s many adventures. After leaving Sophie’s hometown of Kirchen Bell the pair discovers a huge tree identical to one that Plachta had seen in a dream and as they get closer a mysterious vortex pulls them inside. Sophie awakens alone in a curious new world called Erde Wiege and it’s not long before she hears about an alchemist named Plachta that lives on the outskirts of town. Shockingly when Sophie arrives at the atelier she meets a young alchemy enthusiast named Plachta and even though the alchemist shares the same name as her friend she doesn’t recognize Sophie. What other surprises await Sophie on this journey? As the adventure continues Sophie meets aspiring alchemist Ramizel Erlenmeyer who willingly agrees to help her in her time of need. The narrative elegantly unfolds with a charming new visual style that combines the art of the Mysterious sub-series with the high-quality graphics and animations featured in 2021’s Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends and the Secret Fairy.

Last year I almost bought an Xbox Series S. I reserved the console during the first wave of pre-orders thinking it would be an excellent supplemental machine to sit alongside my PS5 but a few weeks from launch I canceled my order.

I ultimately decided not to part with my money because I was and still am unconvinced the entry-level console has a long-term future. The relatively affordable price tag makes it a tempting purchase but its significantly weaker GPU compared to its big brother the Xbox Series X is concerning.

After saving up some extra cash and chasing several restocks I managed to grab an Xbox Series X instead earlier this year. As more next-gen games have launched throughout 2021 my decision to not purchase the Xbox Series S and instead wait until I could afford its more powerful brother has been increasingly validated.

Right now the Xbox Series S makes for a nifty gaming machine but it’s already starting to show its weaknesses. Plus as we get further into this console generation these problems are only going to get worse.

The lesser of the two

To its credit Microsoft has always been extremely upfront when it comes to the Xbox Series S. The tech giant has never claimed the console is capable of the same performance levels as the more expensive Xbox Series X.

The table below lays out the full technical breakdown but the biggest discrepancy between the two machines is easily the GPU. The Xbox Series S sports an AMD RDNA 2 4 teraflops 1.6 GHz which is much less powerful than the beefy AMD RDNA 2 12 teraflops 1.8 GHz found with the Xbox Series X.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Row 0 - Cell 0 Xbox Series X Xbox Series S Price $500 $300 Processor Custom Zen 2 8-core 3.8 GHz Custom Zen 2 8-core 3.8 GHz GPU AMD RDNA 2 12 teraflops 1.8 GHz AMD RDNA 2 4 teraflops 1.6 GHz RAM 16 GB 10 GB Storage 1 TB 512 GB Display (Targeted) 4K 60 fps 1440p 60 fps Display (Max) 8K 120 fps 1440p 120 fps

The two consoles also differ when it comes to RAM and storage capacity. Of course the hard drive size doesn’t impact performance but it does mean the Xbox Series S can only hold a small handful of the best Xbox games before you’ll need to look at alternative storage options.

We’ve tested both consoles extensively found that the Xbox Series X trumps the Xbox Series S in terms of performance in basically all areas. Of course this is hardly surprising but the worrying thing is the performance gulf between the two consoles seems to be growing.

Not quite next-gen enough

Last November when the next-gen Xboxes launched the initial impressions of the Xbox Series S were fairly positive. Even our own Xbox Series S review called it a “surprisingly powerful little console” although we did wisely warn that “it’s not the most future proof gadget you can buy.” These words of warning are starting to ring very true.

While the console seemed to have no problem running early launch games like Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla with a stable 60 fps and in a respectable resolution more recent titles have started to perform pretty poorly on the system.

Most recently FIFA 22 players have been complaining that on Xbox Series S the game is a blurry mess. In fact the resolution is so low that some people can’t even make out the name and numbers on the back of player’s jerseys. The game is in such a bad state some owners have opted to play the Xbox One version instead.

This is far from the first title we’ve seen suffer from performance issues on the Xbox Series S. In April Resident Evil: Village was noted to offer a very poorly implemented ray-tracing mode on the console. The mode is such a CPU drain that the framerate frequently drops to below 30 fps on Xbox Series S.

F1 2021 is another game that had to make compromises on the Xbox Series S. The game targets 1080p on Xbox Series S instead of the 4K target like on PS5 and Xbox Series X. It also doesn’t offer a 120Hz mode on the less powerful console.

Performance issues have also been noted in games like No Man’s Sky Control and eFootball 2022 — although the latter is experiencing a rafter of issues on every platform.

Developers haven’t been shy to comment on the issues that arise when optimizing a game for the Xbox Series S. Last year an employee id Software (a team now actually owned by Microsoft) said “The much lower amount of memory and the split memory banks with drastically slower speeds will be a major issue.” They also noted that just lowering the resolution won’t make up for “the deficiencies.”

Similar comments have been made by a developer at Remedy who noted that optimizing a game for the Series S isn’t as simple as lowering the resolution and texture quality. 4A Games creators of Metro Exodus expressed similar concerns about the console’s weaker GPU.

If developers are having these concerns now imagine the problems that could arise in three or four years' time as games get even more complex and graphically demanding?

It’s only going to get worse

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

The fact of the matter is that these issues are only going to get worse. Right now we’re still in that crossover period between generations with most flagship games still being released for the Xbox One as well as the new Xbox consoles. In the future that won’t be the case.

Titles like the upcoming Dead Space remake have already been confirmed to be next-gen exclusives which means they’ll push the boundaries of these consoles even further. If the Xbox Series S is already beginning to show cracks with games also playable on eight-year-old hardware will it cope with being pushed even further?

My concerns are that these performance issues will only become more and more common on the Xbox Series S. Right now the majority of games seem to perform admirably on the console with only a handful suffering issues but that pendulum may swing the other way over the next few years.

My advice would be to pony up the additional $200 (if you can afford to) and opt for an Xbox Series X. You might have to pay extra right now but in the long term you’ll be getting a better deal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3NhdnZ5LXNhdHVyZGF5LXVzZS1hbWV4LW9mZmVycy13aXRoLWJ1eWVycy1jbHViL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Savvy Saturday: Earn cash with Amex Offers via a buyers club,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available. View the current offers here.

The Amex Offers program is one of the single greatest card benefits of all time. These are targeted statement credits that trigger when you use your card at select merchants.

Many American Express cards including the The Platinum Card® from American Express American Express® Gold Card and the Delta SkyMiles® Gold American Express Card come with access to Amex Offers. If you have an eligible Amex card you can locate your Amex Offers by logging into your account online then scrolling down to the section where they are displayed.

Amex Offers are uniquely effective because they can help you save money on purchases you'd already planned to make. For example there are sometimes big discounts at certain gas stations and some restaurant chains that you don't have to go out of your way to take advantage of.

But what about those other peripheral offers that you've got no intention of redeeming? You can actually make a bit of money from them if you use the following trick.

The secret: Buyers clubs

A buyers club is a company that pays you to buy products for them. They're willing to reimburse you because they think they can resell those products at a profit. Oftentimes you simply enter the buyers club's address as the shipping address so you don't have to deal with any packages. When they receive the package they'll send your money.

A buyers club may pay you to purchase any variety of things due to changing circumstances. Here are some common examples:

Dell begins taking orders for its latest-generation laptop

An oft out-of-stock item like Apple Airpods suddenly go on sale

The U.S. Mint plans to debut a new gold coin that will sell out quickly

Daily Newsletter Reward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter Join over 700000 readers for breaking news in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG’s experts Email address Sign up By signing up you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy . You may unsubscribe at any time.

You can sign-up for email alerts from buyers clubs and you'll get frequent updates as to what they're currently after. All you then need to do is keep tabs on your Amex Offers so you'll know when a buyers club request intersects with a current offer.

When my Amex Platinum Card offered $100 back on Dell purchases of $500+ I personally had no need for Dell products. I instead purchased a computer for a buyers club and my $100 Dell credit posted within two days. Then the buyers club reimbursed me for the entire purchase within a week netting me $100.

Buyers clubs can also be a great way to meet minimum spending requirements or simply generate a lot of spending on your credit card. Below are a couple fantastic examples of Amex Offers that can be used with a buyers club. These appear on my Marriott Bonvoy Business® American Express® Card:

10% back with Dell up to $1500

Up to 75000 bonus Marriott points after spending $75000

That Dell offer is especially magical. If I manage to send $15000 worth of Dell products to a buyers club I'll end up $1500 richer. That's not completely out of the realm of possibility when computers routinely sell for $500+. You can sometimes even purchase five at a time. Not only that but I could stack it with the offer to earn bonus points and snag an extra 15000 Marriott points worth around another $120 based on TPG's current points valuations.

That's an extraordinary set of potential benefits for a card that incurs a $125 annual fee (see rates and fees).

A few caveats

Before you go charging up a storm just keep a few potential drawbacks in mind.

Orders don't always go through

There are some buyers clubs for which I've personally had a very difficult time making purchases. My guess is that merchants see large quantities of items heading to the same address and they flag the purchase as potentially fraudulent. This can be very frustrating as your order may be canceled. Calling to make the purchase can give you a better shot at a successful order though it's far less convenient.

Pay directly through the merchant

Amex Offers tend to come with lots of terms and conditions including some purchases only being eligible through specific links and having to be made directly through the merchant partner. For example if you were offered $100 back on a Dell purchase you couldn't just purchase a Dell computer through Best Buy. The offer would only trigger when you spend through the Dell website.

Only use trusted buyers clubs

At the end of the day you're also trusting a buyers club with hundreds (or even thousands) of your hard-earned dollars. When you send them a product you have very little recourse if they decide not to pay you. I've never seen this happen but it's still a good idea to research the most reputable buyers clubs before you begin liquidating those hard-to-use Amex Offers. I won't endorse any specific buyers clubs in this post.

Bottom line

The Amex Offers I receive on my American Express cards effortlessly save me $500+ every year on purchases I planned to make anyway. But with a bit of elbow grease I can pretty easily double that thanks to buyers clubs. Strategically redeeming Amex Offers can more than offset all my Amex credit card annual fees each year.

The best Xbox controller you can buy is selling at its best price ever today at Amazon and GameStop. Both retailers are selling the black version of the Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller for $150 its best price to date. In our review we praised the controller’s robust customizability which includes adjustable-tension thumbsticks paddles for custom button mapping and more. The controller also comes with shorter hair-trigger locks and offers USB-C and Bluetooth connectivity not to mention a charging dock and case. Battery life is solid as well regardless if you’re playing on an Xbox One Xbox Series X or Windows 10 device; we managed to squeeze roughly 40 hours out of the controller on a single charge.

On the TV front Sony’s 65-inch A80J OLED is now selling at an all-time low. Normally $2298 it’s $500 cheaper at Amazon today bringing the final sale price down to $1798. Other configurations are also selling at their lowest prices to date with the 55-inch model and larger 77-inch panel going for $1698 and $2998 respectively. In its review reviews site RTINGS called it an “excellent all-around TV” praising its performance image quality near-instantaneous response time and low input lag. While the TV doesn’t support a variable refresh rate (VRR) yet — Sony says it will arrive via a future software update — it does come with two HDMI 2.1 ports and can support up to 4K resolution at 120Hz rendering it an excellent pick for gamers looking to take advantage of next-gen consoles even its not the best gaming TV for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X."

The UAE has become the world's second country that approves the registration and use of the Biogen's Aduhelm (aducanumab) the first and only drug for the treatment of early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.

The UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) on Sunday announced the approval after it got the go ahead call from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to start registration and use of the Biogen’s Aduhelm drug for Alzheimer’s disease.

This step allows patients with Alzheimer’s disease in the UAE and regional countries to have early access to this innovative drug resulting in the acceleration of their treatment plan and improvement of the quality of their life.

Aduhelm is supplied as injections containing a dose of 100mlg. The drug is prescribed to patients with early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia) by reducing amyloid beta plaques in the brain.

The medicine registration comes in the wake of the application of MoHAP’s innovative mechanism for its accelerators to evaluate and approve the world’s breakthrough drugs in accordance with the Fast Track/Accelerate Process system. This is coupled with the emphasis on the importance of the early diagnosis and development of medical practices related to Alzheimer's to achieve social and psychological empowerment.

AbdulRahman Bin Mohammed Al Owais Minister of Health & Prevention stated that this significant milestone is pursuant to the directives of the wise leadership to enhance the UAE's leading position in attracting and providing drugs that have proven to be effective and efficient to be incorporated into treatment protocols.

Al Owais noted that the flexibility of supply chains and the enactment of legislations that keep pace with developments in the pharmaceutical industry greatly contribute to speeding up patient's recovery and improving their quality of life which is a top priority for the ministry and other health authorities.

The Health Minister indicated that the UAE is among the world's fastest countries in terms of granting approvals for innovative drugs which increases the healing chances of patients in the UAE and the region.

Rachid Azar Executive Vice President Alzheimer’s and Cognitive Impairment Business Unit said: ""Biogen's tireless research efforts and dedication to achieving its goals have enabled us to fulfill our commitment to provide the first treatment of its kind in many years to Alzheimer's patients. We believe that this drug will give patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease their families and healthcare providers a new glimmer of hope especially as they have been waiting for scientific progress in this regard for decades.

Dr Paul Aisen Alzheimer's Therapeutic Research Institute (ATRI) University of Southern California said: ""For the first time in history we have achieved an unprecedented achievement by moving beyond treating the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease towards targeting its main causes. Early detection and diagnosis of MCI will allow us to identify patients who may benefit from this innovative treatment.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Now he’s an apostate convinced that one of the fastest growth areas in financing is a sham. “It’s clear to me now” he writes in a recent three-part essay in Medium that my work “only made matters worse by leading the world into a dangerous mirage an oasis in the middle of the desert that is burning valuable time.”



So-called ESG (environmental social and governance) investing Fancy argues merely allows fund managers to charge higher fees for investment products that have “scant or little evidence of real-world impact that would not have otherwise occurred.” So what if these funds divest themselves of big-time polluters like oil companies? Other investors will happily step in leaving the companies themselves no worse off. As Fancy points out “10% of the market not buying your stock is not the same as 10% of your customers not buying your product.”



Besides he notes green assets are just a drop in the ocean set against the $360 trillion of global wealth operating in a business-as-usual way.



Fancy’s argument draws on a sports metaphor. Wall Street is focused on scoring points (maximizing profits) not good sportsmanship (being a responsible investor.)

In a bumper weekend of Limerick hurling the County Cup final between Kildimo Pallaskenry and Garryspillane will kick start proceedings on Friday evening.

The one off game takes place on Friday evening at the newly renamed TUS Gaelic Grounds with a 7.30pm throw in.

For the second consecutive year the final will be played between sides who didn’t qualify for the quarter-finals but also avoided a relegation decider.

Blackrock are current champions as they beat Monaleen 1-20 to 0-19 last sumer.

Kildimo Pallaskenry will be hoping for a first piece of silverware in the senior ranks after winning promotion last year. KP have taken to life in the senior ranks well and picked up a comprehensive win their opening game against Monaleen with the five point margin flattering the losing side. KP lost out to Adare in their second game but were competitive throughout.

Their opponents Garryspillane had a similar path to the County Cup falling to Blackrock in their opening game before overcoming South Liberties in their final group tie with relegation facing them had they lost.

Previous Meetings

2018 PIHC SF: Garryspillane 1-14 : 0-13 Kildimo Pallaskenry

2018 PIHC: Kildimo Pallaskenry 1-18 : 0-17 Garryspillane

The most recent meeting of the sides came in the 2018 Premier Intermediate semi-final in Bruff. In their first year at the grade Kildimo Pallaskenry made an immediate impression and beat the South side in round two by four points in Caherconlish. But in the rematch with a place in the final on the line it was a reversal of the result with Garryspillane claiming a four point win.

The Bouncers took an early lead with a Dylan O’Shea goal and were buoyed by the sending off of Kyle Hayes a couple of months after he was named man of the match in the All-Ireland final. KP reduced the deficit to a single score with time running out as Garryspillane held out before going on to win the championship defeating Bruff in the decider.

Since then Garryspillane have struggled in the senior ranks picking up just two wins from their nine group games. The Bouncer drew two of their games in the senior ranks in their maiden season at the level while also picking up a win over Knockainey. But last year they found themselves in the relegation final where they overcame Murroe Boher.

As for Kildimo Pallaskenry they have gone from strength to strength since the semi-final loss to Garryspillane reaching the PIHC decider twelve months later before losing out to Blackrock after a replay. They made no mistake in 2020 beating Mungret St Pauls 0-22 to 1-13.

However Garryspillane will be hopeful that the South Liberties win will act as a catalyst for the still youthful side that won back to back premier minor titles in 2017 and ’18.

KP will be favoured but in a one off game this could go either way.

Kildimo Pallaskenry take on Garryspillane in the Limerick Senior County Cup Final on Friday evening at the TUS Gaelic Grounds at 7.30pm.

Knockrea House has canted bay windows on the west and east facades with the entry point to the right of the latter

About 200 years old but in rude good health and ripe for repurposing as a home once more Knockrea House is a detached build of over 3700 sq ft. It sits on very mature grounds of close to one acre with some specimen trees about a mile or so from the city.

Class in glass

It has ‘worked its passage’ for almost half a century having been the Munster offices of the Irish Business and Employers and Employers Confederation (Ibec) the business lobbying and representation body for the last 25 years and before that for Ibec’s precursor the Federated Union of Employers (FUE) when it was also called FUE House.

Impressive gated entrance in wrought and cast iron designed to make a statement

A FUE or Ibec business nameplate has graced the ornate wrought and cast iron entrance gates of Knockrea House since the 1970s but has recently been removed as Ibec has relocated to state-of-the-art offices on Cork City’s quays.

Ibec has moved to the JCD Group-developed Penrose Dock taking 5000 sq ft overlooking the River Lee to replace the 3780 sq ft of more domestic space it vacated on the Douglas Road during the latter phase of the Covid-19 pandemic era.

Knockrea House is new to market this week with estate agent Laura Pratt of Lisney who guides at €1.25m.

Reception room

This upping of anchors by Ibec to Penrose Quay is where the touch of coincidence or serendipity enters the corporate body’s move from a 19th-century domestic classic with architectural adornments embellishments to a 21st-century sleek construct in steel stone and glass.

Bittern ship painting found in Knockrea House. It will move with Ibec to Penrose Dock where Penrose House was the main office of the Cork Steam Packet Company/St George Steam Packet Company who commissioned the Bittern's construction in the 1850s.

During a clear-out of the 1810/1820-built house several paintings of local nautical and Cork Harbour scenes came to light including one of a boat called the Bittern (pictured here) in a painting by artist RL Stopford.

Bittern was a 220ft three-masted and boiler-driven vessel commissioned by the Cork Steam Packet Company and launched in 1856 after a remarkable six-month build period according to a typed legend (pic far left) on the back of the painting. Bittern was one of a number of vessels built by Ebeneezer Pike at a ship yard on Water Street with many of them called after birds such as Bittern Cormorant Dado Falcon Gannet Ibis and Osprey.

At the time Bittern was built the home of the Cork Steam Packet Company was on Penrose Quay where a Cork Steam Packet Company precursor was the St George Steam Packet Company. A statue of St George fighting the dragon has recently been reinstated by JCD at its conserved c 1831 Penrose House fronting on to Penrose Dock’s new offices where Ibec’s Bittern painting will be put in its own reception area.

Account of the Bittern's origins

Various architectural guides date Knockrea House to the early 1800s describing its original construction as “a neat two-storey villa of c 1810 given an Italian makeover c 1860” (Frank Keohane in his recent Buildings of Ireland: Cork City and County Yale University Press.)

That Italianate makeover in Victorian times is when Knockrea House got its bracketed pediments over widows canted side bay windows east and west with pink granite columns or colonettes fanlit door and other Ionic columns and decorative plaster flourishes.

Hall

Guides don’t credit Knockrea House’s early occupants but its original name was Summerville House and it was built at a time when a small number of good detached houses were being built along the main Douglas Road between the city centre and Douglas village more or less half way between both.

There are fewer of these Georgian and Victorian ‘villas’ on the Douglas Road compared to Blackrock Road for instance if and when talking about the somewhat nebulous and mostly subjective concept of ‘Cork’s best addresses.’

While hardy annuals such as Blackrock (and Cobh Monkstown Sunday’s Well Montenotte and St Luke’s Cross) are well endowed with period homes of charm and space and more weighted to the Victorian era than the Georgian period most of Cork’s Douglas Road’s best-surviving houses date to later periods such as the Edwardian era with late 19th-century terraces in between along with mid-20th-century suburban parks and estates.

Knockrea House is on close to one acre on the main Douglas Road

Today the Knockrea name is also carried in several 20th-century developments that lie between this period house’s back boundary wall and the Ballinlough Road such as Knockrea Drive Knockrea Lawn Knockrea Mews and Knockrea Gardens.

A main Douglas Road estate Knockrea Park mainly comprising very large semi-ds is considered pretty upmarket with No 6 selling for €790000 in 2019. No 3 made €685000 two years earlier while No 9 made €730000 in 2011.

A lodge building once associated with Knockrea House located just on the city side of the main house over a high stone wall came for sale in 2015 guiding at €325000 (also via Lisney).

The c1100sq ft three-bed G BER-rated Knockrea Lodge was swiftly sold for €405000 and then demolished and replaced with a contemporary one-off by Collins Brennan Architects. (Knockrea Lodge is one of several recent total rebuilds along the Douglas Road with finished houses clearly now in the €1m+ price league.)

A comparable sale to Knockrea House was that of the Arts and Crafts-style Cooleens in 2014. It made €755000 but was in quite poor order with some who viewed considering knocking it.

Cooleens survived thankfully and was upgraded. It is comparable to Knockrea House mainly because it too is on an acre of gardens.

So finally to the prospects for Knockrea House itself guided today at €1.25m?

Stairwell has coloured glass feature arched window

It’s in incredibly solid order was reroofed some years back and still has oodles of architectural detailing and integrity; sash windows shutters ornate plasterwork stained glass great room proportions and ceiling heights in the main rooms and an overall airiness amid its c 3780 sq ft.

However because it hasn’t been a private family home for half a century it does need some ‘domesticating’.

Smartly Ibec senior facilities and property manager Louise Kirwan has spent ‘hands-on’ time at the property its pre-sale viewings doing a light ‘staging’ of several rooms to show how they’d hold family-scale furniture for bedrooms dining and seating: it not only takes the bare look off some of the main rooms it also restores a sense of incipient repurposing.

Despite an L-shape and rear annex with an internal/enclosed courtyard framed by a back boundary wall it doesn’t have a kitchen of any description and its bathrooms are more in keeping with ‘ladies’ and ‘gents’ loos so there is work to be done.

On the plus side a new owner with a fairly open pocketbook wallet or purse will along with their architect get to design and detail these most important spaces.

These are the rooms that always get made over in any case when a major house sale or period home change-of-hands takes place often at considerable cost.

In this case buyers will be starting with almost a blank canvas as to where to put the kitchen? They could either open up rooms to the back and side or add on a whole new modern wing on either the city/west or village/east sides.

In the right design hands you’d hardly go wrong given the main four-bay facade faces due south so a wing on either side will get this sunny aspect plus either the best of morning or evening light.

Why not go the whole hog and add on balancing wings one either side for dedicated purposes? The house and the level grounds with lawn and leafy greenery can easily take it.

After all it already got quite the major modernising makeover at least once before… in the 1860s with its Italianate flourishes.

Examples of older Cork homes that have gone from historic private residences to commercial uses/offices only to bounce back bigger and better than ever to family homes once more include Dundanion House in Blackrock (Cork’s finest?) and Villa Franca on the Douglas Road.

Like them Knockrea House has the bonus of exceptionally mature gardens and indeed specimen trees that were respected through changing ownerships and uses.

Lisney’s Laura Pratt guides Knockrea House at €1.25m and in fact that’s pretty much on a par with what it was briefly put to the market for in 2012 also with Lisney before the sale was pulled.

(Back in 2012 a religious-based organisation was interested in its purchase sources said at the time.).

In a much stronger residential market than the trough period of 2012 Knockrea House is almost certainly set to be bought as a private family home even if a ‘money little or no object’ project could see total investment add another €500000 to the purchase amount (or way more?). It could be a no-expense spared dream home project for its next occupiers.

Gearing up for private viewings once past Knockrea House’s fantastic gated entrance Ms Pratt notes “the possibility of acquiring a large period property on an acre of mature gardens in a secluded setting yet within 1km of Cork City seldom presents itself”. Her offer on the Douglas Road now “offers an unbeatable location impressive site size and quality finish throughout.”

VERDICT: The former Ibec Munster HQ Knockrea House will be just ‘the business’ for families on the hunt for a very special home project.",,,

In a burst of multibillion-dollar deals Las Vegas has seen investors pay mountains of money the past few years to own high-profile casino-resorts.

Those sales have also shown what casino operators — well one in particular — are willing to pay to rent these properties.

MGM Resorts International has reached deals since fall 2019 to lease Bellagio MGM Grand Mandalay Bay Aria Vdara and as announced this week The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.

Its initial annual rent ranges from $200 million for The Cosmopolitan to $292 million for MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay.

All but one of the deals involved sale-leasebacks that netted MGM a fortune in proceeds including more than $4 billion for Bellagio alone. Moreover all of the deals involved the same company on the other side of the table New York financial giant Blackstone which has been gobbling up real estate in Southern Nevada for years.

Still the nine-figure rental rates show what MGM is willing to pay to keep running its properties and to take over another towering resort on the Strip The Cosmopolitan without buying its real estate.

A landlord and tenant determine a casino-resort’s rental rate based on a property’s earnings stability market and possible corporate guarantee according to Truist Securities analyst Barry Jonas.

When MGM announced in July that it was selling Aria and Vdara to Blackstone for nearly $3.9 billion in cash and renting them back it noted the sales price was a little over 18 times its rent which initially is $215 million a year.

At the time Tyler Henritze head of real estate acquisitions in the Americas for Blackstone said such deals were attractive for several reasons including “long-term leases with stable cash flows and no capital expenditure obligations and in this case a full corporate guaranty of rent payments from a best-in-class operator.”

After Blackstone purchased multiple MGM-operated properties on the Strip it’s now selling The Cosmopolitan for $5.65 billion. As part of the deal MGM is acquiring the resort’s operations side for more than $1.6 billion and leasing the property from a group of owners.

MGM did not respond to a request for comment Friday on its rental rates.

The casino chain has made a fortune selling its real estate as part of its “asset-light” strategy though as with any deal there are risks to leasing a resort rather than owning the property outright.

Jonas for one noted there is a “finality” to selling a building and losing control over it.

Plus as Macquarie Capital analyst Chad Beynon pointed out tenants “always owe that rent” and have to set aside money every year to pay their landlord.

Even after the coronavirus pandemic sparked catastrophic job losses and led to nationwide casino closures turning the Strip into a ghost town for a while casino landlords came out OK.

One major landlord is now buying another in a $17 billion-plus deal.

Caesars Entertainment spinoff Vici Properties announced in August that it was acquiring MGM Resorts spinoff MGM Growth Properties putting real estate ownership of many of Las Vegas’ biggest hotel-casinos under one company.

After the deal was announced Vici chief executive Edward Pitoniak said the two casino landlords had collected “100 percent of our rent so far through COVID on time and in cash.”

In the last ten years we have seen Cuba’s Nicaro Queensland Nickel’s mine of the same name Votorantim’s SMP and First Quantum’s Ravensthorpe nickel operations all shuttered (with Ravensthorpe coming on and off as nickel prices dictated profitability).

New Caledonia’s Goro operation has continued to operate but well under capacity and it has been the same story for Sumitomo’s Ambatovy in Madagascar. The result was that a lot of Class I nickel (and high purity nickel oxide such as from Queensland Nickel Nicaro and Goro) came off the market with no new greenfield projects coming online to meet demand when it began to rise.

In response battery manufacturers started to work backwards looking for new nickel sources that would allow for interchangeable substitution between metal briquettes powder and oxide. Crude forms of nickel sulphate (NiSO4) from platinum group metal (PGM) refiners such as Sibanye-Stillwater and Impala saw payable nickel increase as demand increased. However the availability of this material was limited so the battery industry moved on to look at intermediates that would behave similarly to nickel briquettes or nickel powder.

The available options were mixed sulphide precipitate (MSP) basic nickel carbonate (BNC) and mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP). All of these are less expensive to produce than briquettes powder or oxide because they are an intermediate to making that product. In addition they all sell at a discount to London Metals Exchange (LME) prices as opposed to briquettes which are LME deliverable and powder/oxides which are typically priced at or greater than LME depending on application.

MSP which is typically 55% nickel is produced by exposing high pressure acid leach (HPAL) solutions to hydrogen sulphide which is a lethal gas. Ambatovy Glencore’s Minara Sherritt’s Moa Bay and Sumitomo Metals Coral Bay and Taganito all produce MSP. Finnish producer Terrafame also produces MSP from a heap leach operation.

Basic nickel carbonate sits between 40-50% nickel. It was the intermediate of choice for Caron process plants [which were energy intensive and relied on reducing gases to convert the laterite ore into one that could be easily leached in an ammonia solution allowing for recovery as BNC prior to refining into final product] however these plants are now essentially defunct. It was also produced at Queensland Nickel Votorantim’s Niquelandia (Brazil) Marinduque’s Nonoc (Philippines) Nicaro and Punta Gorda (Cuba). Of these only Punta Gorda is still operating.

Of these three options it was MHP that quickly gained acceptance because it behaves very similar to nickel briquettes powder or oxide in that it can be dissolved in the same equipment at the same rates. Admittedly it contains higher impurity levels and other magnetic materials but these can be removed with additional investment beyond current purification circuits. After all these same contaminants are typically present in briquettes and so forth but in greatly reduced concentrations so it is just a rate limiting issue.

MHP supply was also more favourable than its competitors. Ravensthorpe had decided to produce MHP because refining was to take place at Queensland Nickel which already upgraded basic nickel carbonate to nickel oxide. Nickel 28’s joint venture on Ramu with China Metallurgical (MCC) was the second operation to start making MHP given it is far safer to make than mixed sulphide precipitate (MSP). Meta Nikel’s Gordes in Turkey was designed to make MHP and is now operating.

Evolving market

As demand rose producers quickly responded. Goro now owned by Prony Resources is focusing on MHP production and Indonesia has announced it is building five HPAL projects that will produce MHP with capacity stated to be almost 240000 tonnes per year of contained nickel by 2025 according to Australia’s Macquarie Bank.

Additionally two companies with major nickel sulphide projects recently announced that they are going to pursue or produce MHP. The first one is a company in Australia called Blackstone Minerals which has a nickel sulphide mine in Vietnam. The other is Giga Metals which has an advanced nickel sulphide project in Canada and has announced that instead of making concentrate it will make MHP. Brazilian Nickel continues to pursue high purity MHP/BNC at its Piaui project in Brazil.

What we’ve seen is the MHP market evolve from an intermediate to a primary feed in the manufacture of rechargeable batteries. And it’s even going further downstream. For example cathode plants like BASF and Umicore are building their plants adjacent to MHP producers and they’ll take solution right across the fence and make cathode-active material directly from that to save on shipping costs. This concept is being heavily promoted in Canada Australia and Indonesia as an integrated supply chain from mine to precursor/cathode.

The rapidly rising dominance of MHP makes their change of direction an obvious choice. This is particularly so because making MHP from sulphide or sulphide concentrate is much simpler and therefore less costly than making it from laterites thus giving sulphide deposits an advantage in the race to cash in on MHP’s rising importance.

What has happened to matte? In February 2021 China’s Tsingshan upset the global nickel market by announcing it will convert Class II nickel pig iron (NPI) into intermediate nickel matte utilizing old but well proven technology. The goal was to solve the looming battery grade nickel deficit.

However nickel matte cannot be converted to nickel sulphate as easily as nickel powder nickel briquettes or MHP/MSP. Therefore it requires additional investment by nickel sulphate producers. Admittedly nickel matte sells at a discount to LME the same as NPI however recent NPI pricing has changed the economics of converting NPI to matte and suggests that matte production via this route will remain as swing capacity depending on market conditions. Matte produced from NPI generates significant greenhouse gas emissions and goes in the opposite direction to the requirements of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

Three years ago nickel intermediates had no use in the market except to be refined to either a chemical like a plaiting grade nickel sulphate or into a metal that went into stainless steel or alloys. They sold at a significant discount to the LME because producers were happy to receive the going rate of 75% of the nickel value. While MHP is still selling below LME that discount has dwindled and now sits at approximately 5-10%.

The number of new MHP operations expected during this cycle could increase global supply to approximately 400000 tonnes according to Macquarie. That number is going to rival the availability of briquettes and powder which of course are still used in traditional industries. And now that MHP producers recognize they don’t have to make nickel briquettes and powder they are selling directly to the battery cathode producers. Prices for MHP may have risen but they are still about 10% cheaper nickel content than buying briquettes and powder and battery producers are now negotiating long-term contracts for supply and even investing in the plants in Indonesia. MHP really has become the new Class 1 nickel.

The contract is a modification of another previously signed with the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) where Boeing was supposed to produce LJDAMs for the Navy Air Force and Foreign Military Sales customers. The new agreement allows for the production of up to 24.000 additional pump kits.

“The JDAM laser enables precise attacks against moving threats while minimizing collateral damage” said Karl Jeppesen Vice President of Armaments at Boeing. “We are proud to continue to provide this critical capability for our members of the armed forces.”

JDAM kits transform a conventional bomb into a precision weapon guided by GPS and inertial navigation system (INS). However this type of guidance limits the bomb to being used against static targets such as buildings and pillboxes. Therefore Boeing created the Laser JDAM where the bombs received a 'receiver' in the frontal section allowing the acquisition and guidance through laser. In this way they can be used to attack moving vehicles.

JDAM kits are available for the Mk.82 83 and 84 bombs of various variants.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8wMy90cmlwLXJlcG9ydC1xYXRhci1haXJ3YXlzLWI3ODctOS1uZXctYnVzaW5lc3MtY2xhc3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trip Report: Qatar Airways B787-9 New Business Class - SamChui.com,"I flew on Qatar Airways B787-9 in their new Business Class Suite from Doha to Istanbul recently.

Before the flight I visited the Al Safwa First Class Lounge in Doha. I had an interesting Tibetan massage treatment in the spa and spent some time touring around the First Class Lounge.

First Look of the Qatar Airways B787-9

Qatar Airways B787-9 joined the fleet at the end of 2019. During COVID the 787-9 fleet was used as passenger freighter ""Preighter"". They have now been fitted with a new Business Class and re-joined the passenger fleet in late June this year.

There are 30 Business Class Suite in 1-2-1 configuration. The seat arrangement is known as the ""herringbone"" style. What's new is the door panel on each Business Class suite.

Economy Class is in a typical 3-3-3 seat configuration. Legroom is about 32-33"" seat pitch. There is a total of 281 seats across two sections of the B787-9.

Doha to Istanbul

My flight was operated by A7-BHD. Flight time to Istanbul was just a little short of 4 hours with about a 50% load factor.





2 layered side table design.

The Business Class Suite features a wireless phone charger which is a handy feature and means no more messy cables.





As usual on Qatar Airways dining is on demand. I had a colourful salmon and scallop starter. For the main course I had a rather bland vegetarian risotto but I did have an excellent Arabic knafah dessert.

This is how the new Business Class Suite looks like from the top view.

You can see the wall panel isn't very tall compared to my head position.

The New Business Class Suite is Narrow for me

The New Business Class Suite is narrow for me when compared to the original QSuite on the A350/B777. The footwell also has limited space as the dining table is right on top.

For a 4 hour flight I had no issues but I'd much prefer the wider QSuite on an ultra long-haul flight.

So far Qatar Airways seems to use the B787-9 on medium-haul sectors like Doha to Europe Kathmandu or Kuala Lumpur.

The bar was not used during our flight.

Nice Landing Into Istanbul

We arrived in Istanbul around 18:30 which is the best time of the day. We flew over the entire city and Ataturk Airport before lining up for runway 35R of New Istanbul Int'l. Watch the spectacular landing on my YouTube video.

Final Verdict

The new Business Class Suite on Qatar Airways 787-9 isn’t the same as their award-winning Q-Suite It feels more like a junior version. The centre seat pairs face away from each other and the suite feels narrower than QSuite on B777/A350.

Pros:

Consistency in service delivery

Wireless Charger

Enhanced privacy with suite door

Cons:

Narrower seat

Centre seat pair face away from each other this can be a problem for travellers traveling together

When in full sleeping position you're quite close to the ground. The table on top of the footwell created less room to turn

Turbines were already used in industries but the use in vehicles used on a day-to-day basis is another story.

First of all it is important to point out that unlike airplanes the engines moved the vehicles through the shaft attached to the turbine and not through the exhaustion of gases that generate the necessary thrust to make the aircraft fly. In a way similar to a turboprop.

Between the 1960s and 1950s Boeing increased its market base and started to produce its own jet engines as well. And one of those engines ended up being used in three fire trucks.

During the 1960 International Convention of Fire Chiefs the North American company American LaFrance one of the largest fire fighting vehicle manufacturers of all time presented a Series 900 self-pumping truck equipped with a Boeing 502- 10MA with a power of 325shp.

Through modifications carried out by Boeing the turbine could use gasoline or diesel. Jet engines used in aircraft use aviation kerosene. The vehicle called the American LaFrance/Boeing Turbo Chief was acquired by the San Francisco Fire Department. The following year the Seattle Fire Department acquired a Turbo Chief Tiller Ladder.

Tiller vehicles are common in the US and are a tractor pulling a trailer equipped with a 100-foot (305-meter) mechanical ladder. At the end of the trailer a fireman maneuvers the cart with a steering wheel. The vehicle was purchased for US$ 52. In the same year firefighters in Mount Vernon a small town in Virginia received a Turbo Chief self-pump.

Visually the Turbo Chief's biggest difference from other fire trucks was a large chrome exhaust pipe mounted just behind the cab. The air intake for the engine was at the bottom of the vehicle which still received two boosters. The Turbo Chief's biggest highlight was its acceleration reaching 80 km/h in 31 seconds. Some sources highlight the silence regarding diesel engines.

However the maintenance of the vehicles ended the use of the turbines. The Turbo Chief was great for climbing the endless hills of Seattle and San Francisco the problem was the descent. The high speed and lack of turbine compression brought premature wear to the trucks' brakes even with reinforced shoes and drums.

Maintenance costs became prohibitive and the Boeing engines were retired and replaced with diesel engines at no cost. The Seattle car received a 323hp Hall-Scott engine and was returned to the city's fire department on 27/11/1962.

The Mount Vernon firefighters “suffered” a little more as every time they had problems with the turbine a Boeing mechanic traveled to the city from Seattle. The 502-10MA was replaced by a straight-six Continental. The Turbo Chief of San Francisco also had its engine changed but today it is preserved.

In the end the use of reaction engines in vehicles for daily use in the city did not work out. American LaFrance vehicles remained in service for many years but with conventional engines. The manufacturer which even sold vehicles to Brazil closed its doors in 2014. Boeing concentrated on producing aircraft ending engine production in 1966.

Life sciences company Schrödinger (SDGR -1.77%) has developed software that could help drug companies develop medicine using artificial intelligence and physics and it's already being used by a number of big-name pharma companies.

In this video from ""Beat & Raise"" on Motley Fool Live recorded on Sept. 23 tech healthcare and cannabis editor and analyst Olivia Zitkus and Fool.com contributor Brian Withers take a look at Schrödinger's technology recent earnings results and what makes it a stock to watch.

10 stocks we like better than Schrödinger Inc.

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.* They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Schrödinger Inc. wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of September 17 2021

Olivia Zitkus: Sure. I will take this home with Schrödinger before we hop over to some questions from Slido. This is a very complicated stock to end on so I'm going to do my best to explain what in the world it does. Schrödinger is a pharma software company and more. It basically runs computer simulations that work on AI-driven molecular design. Its platform is all AI and physics-based. It runs various chemical simulations to help companies find basically medicinal combinations that have higher probabilities of success. It's also developing its own medications off of this platform.

Their main idea is basically if you can compute all relevant molecular properties with high accuracy with the computer designing drugs and materials so not even just inside the pharma space but materials too would have a higher success rate be faster and they'd be cheaper. It's named Schrödinger after the Schrödinger's cat theory from physics which took me back to high school and yeah it applies to this stock because they're trying to observe how many possible outcomes that nature could fall to that could help produce a positive outcome. Go Google Schrödinger's cat we don't have time for that. That's a whole other rabbit hole.

But it's a very interesting company. Its priorities now it only IPO'd I think in February 2020 its priorities right now are investments to advance its own drug discovery pipeline using this AI- and physics-driven model and to drive the adoption of its software among other pharma businesses. I should mention it was actually founded in 1990 only went public in 2020. As investors in situations like this I want to look at several metrics and qualitative areas in both software. That's the first phase and the drug development spaces. R&D spending cash on-hand strength of the pipeline itself what actual drugs are they working on collaboration agreements annual contract value so you've got this awesome mix of both the software issues that we're used to looking at for SaaS companies and then also these healthcare and drug pipeline issues that I'm used to looking at for biotech.

Just quickly revenue in their second quarter that was released on Aug. 12 was up 23% year over year. It came in at $32 million and software revenue comprised $26.3 million of that and that segment grew 11% year over year. The business has a good bit of cash on hand. It has about $650 million in cash but that was as of March 31. A couple of its partners that have signed on to develop drugs with its platform they're pretty big. Bristol Myers Squibb Zai Lab Takeda Pharmaceuticals is one as well. Their software annual contract value was up 22% from 2019 to 2020 to about $91 million their annual contract value and customer retention for high-spending groups over $1 million in annual contract value. The compound annual growth rate for that group is 27%. The high spenders are spending a lot more so far year over year which is great news. Then for the customers who are paying just above $100000 a year their compound annual growth rate I think it's more around 13.

So far this year the stock is down about 25% year to date. They are expecting I think total revenues of about $130 million at the midpoint which would represent about 25$increase year over year. It's still a mid-cap company so there are going to be bigger swings on good and bad news like a lot of the companies we've talked about [laughs] over this past hour. But I think for Schrödinger it's the tech that's changing the game and the drug development is there as proof of that technological concept and as proof of that AI- and physics-driven concept. They sound like they're excited about recurring revenue they're high top-line visibility from their software sales that's what's going to drive growth through them. They've acknowledged that the drug discovery revenue is a little bit less predictable than the software revenue based on the timing of collaborative agreements and milestones as it relate to the development process. Their operations their expenses aren't done growing either. But if the concept works which it looks like it does we can discover new compounds in a fraction of the time it normally takes us and then a fraction of the cost. We can only imagine tapping into the drug discovery space for a lot less money and what a difference that would make. That's Schrödinger that might be the most complicated stock of the day. [laughs]

Brian Withers: Yeah that's a super interesting company. I love the use of software to help with shortening the drug discovery timeline. I'm surprised at some of the big pharma companies didn't invent a homegrown solution on their own here. Are these guys an independent neutral party for the industry and a first-mover?

Zitkus: Yeah that's a really good question. They are neutral party. They partnered with a lot of different big named pharma companies that you would think if there were a pharma company to move on something like this they would've done it. Gilead Takeda. I think Sanofi I believe Taylor might know as well. Sanofi I never say that one correctly. Those are big companies that didn't bring the effort under their own roof and decided to partner with Schrödinger to get it done instead. In 2016 Gilead bought a specialized system just for one treatment development of drugs for one indication rather for $1.2 billion and that was in 2016. You've either got these companies coming in and buying a very specific software that's tailored to that company's drug developing specialty or you've got partnerships like they have now with Bristol Myers Squibb when they're working in tandem to develop the software iterate together and do that thing instead they're paying for the computing services in the development process. I think it's a neutral party and definitely has its early mover advantage. I'm not totally sure if it's the first to attempt this type of work but like I said they've been around since 1990 and they rolled out their first predictor system in 2001. That's a long time definitely early mover advantage if not first.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXBpbnRvLm5ldC90b3ducy9uZXctYnJ1bnN3aWNrL3NlY3Rpb25zL2hlYWx0aC1hbmQtd2VsbG5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvY2hpbGRyZW4tcy1zcGVjaWFsaXplZC1ob3NwaXRhbC1pbi1uZXctYnJ1bnN3aWNrLWFwcG9pbnRzLW5ldy12aWNlLXByZXNpZGVudNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Children's Specialized Hospital in New Brunswick Appoints New Vice President,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.tapinto.net/towns/new-brunswick/sections/health-and-wellness/articles/children-s-specialized-hospital-in-new-brunswick-appoints-new-vice-president on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXBpbnRvLm5ldC90b3ducy9uZXctYnJ1bnN3aWNrL3NlY3Rpb25zL2hlYWx0aC1hbmQtd2VsbG5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvY2hpbGRyZW4tcy1zcGVjaWFsaXplZC1ob3NwaXRhbC1pbi1uZXctYnJ1bnN3aWNrLWFwcG9pbnRzLW5ldy12aWNlLXByZXNpZGVudNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

She obediently and joyfully served the Lord during her 81 years in this world. She will be greatly missed by so many but she leaves a lasting legacy of faith to all those who knew and loved her.

Sister Brown loved her church and all the people in it. While she was sick she often said how much she wanted to share with her church members how God was working to show His light and love to those around her even during her illness. She dedicated her life in service to the Lord and was known as a mighty prayer warrior. She delighted in beauty around her as shown by her tender care for her flowers or by the sparkly pin that might grace the lapel of her suit. She always wanted to show love to those around her so freely gave gifts to those she met to show her appreciation.

She was born on December 21 1942 in Austinville Virginia. She graduated from Ft. Chiswell High School and attended Radford University. She worked in bookkeeping for years at Hobert N. Grubb and then at the International Headquarters for the Church of God of Prophecy. She devoted her life to ministry and earned a Bachelors degree in Theology. She served in countless roles for the Church of God of Prophecy including State Ladies Retreat Director State Treasurer District Representative for Church of God of Prophecy Markers Association and was the keynote speaker at many church retreats and events. She pastored several churches over the years and loved her current congregation at Botetourt Church of God of Prophecy.

She was preceded in death by her parents Dempsey and Mildred Poole Eversole; her nephew Charles Cooley; and her brother-in-law Dr. Donald Bowdle. She is survived by her loving and faithful husband of 58 years Douglas Brown as well as her sister Jean Bowdle; her niece and nephew Drs. Dianna & Joshua Puhr and children Jacoby Ty Aria Justin Josie; as well as great niece Bethany Cooley and children Annabelle McKinley and Jaxon.

Peggy Brown’s life is a beautiful testimony of a life dedicated to Christ and to serving His people. She will be deeply missed but we know she is now rejoicing with the angels in Heaven. “The grass withers and the flowers fall but the word of our God endures forever.” Isaiah 40:8

The celebration of Sister Brown’s life will take place Monday May 13 2024 at the Poplar Camp Church of God of Prophecy 1437 Lead Mine Rd. Austinville VA. Family will receive friends from 1:00 – 2:00 pm and the Funeral Service will be conducted at 2:00 pm.

Rege-Jean Page the star of Netflix Inc.'s ""Bridgerton"" is gamblers' current favorite to be the next James Bond which would give the franchise its first Black person in the lead role.

Online poker play may be on the verge of a comeback in Nevada

Say hello to curling the next competitive sport in Las Vegas

Shrewd move MGM.

Last week the largest employer on the Strip made the surprise announcement that it’s acquiring the operations of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for $1.625 billion.

It’s part of a larger $5.65 billion real estate deal for Blackstone with a method in vogue in the gaming industry these days: A group of investors is buying the real estate beneath The Cosmopolitan and MGM is getting the operations piece.

In turn under the 30-year contract that has three 10-year options MGM would pay $200 million annual rent to the investment group which includes a Blackstone real estate investment trust and the family trust of the founders of Panda Express.

The Blackstone Group picked up The Cosmopolitan seven years ago for $1.73 billion so it’s netting a nice profit. Former MGM CEO Jim Murren pitched the idea of buying The Cosmopolitan years ago but nothing came of it until last week.

The deal still has to pass regulatory muster probably in early 2022 but Brendan Bussmann director of government affairs for Las Vegas-based Global Market Advisors thinks it will happen.

“The average visitor saw Cosmo as part of the CityCenter complex” Bussmann said. “Now you will be able to create some true synergies between this side of the Strip from Bellagio south.”

A clever deal

The deal is smart on so many levels.

MGM gets to maintain its “assets-light” strategy that the company initiated five years ago. The company has to pay annual rent and generate revenue from the casino the hotel and all of the other assets in the building.

Once The Cosmopolitan deal is done MGM would have only one property — MGM Springfield in Massachusetts — that the company would own. But in regulatory hearings company officials have said a real estate company would buy Springfield by the end of the year which would make MGM the tenant at 100 percent of its resorts.

MGM gets its fair share of customer traffic from the mature well-established baby boomer. Now the company can mine a younger generation as The Cosmopolitan since it opened in 2010 has become a hipster haven.

While The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas is considered a luxury hotel there’s no doubt MGM could persuade some of its new younger customers to move up to the likes of Bellagio through loyalty programs.

Check out the geography of the deal.

From north to south MGM’s holdings down Las Vegas Boulevard would include Bellagio Cosmopolitan CityCenter — Aria and the nongaming Vdara — Park MGM New York-New York Excalibur Luxor and Mandalay Bay.

Everything is pretty much side by side on the west side of the Strip except for one isolated property The Mirage.

The company’s lone property on the east side of the boulevard: MGM Grand.

The Caesars lineup

Now look at its biggest competitor Caesars Entertainment Inc. It’s established the same way on the east side of the Strip with Harrah’s Las Vegas The Linq Flamingo The Cromwell Bally’s Paris Las Vegas and Planet Hollywood.

The lone property on the west side of the Strip: Caesars Palace the company’s flagship and best-known asset.

Caesars also has the advantage of easy access to a transit system it didn’t have to build the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority-owned Las Vegas Monorail. If a major portion of the gaming industry’s future is in group sales for conventions and trade shows Caesars is all set: There’s a Monorail stop at the massive Las Vegas Convention Center and the company’s not-even-broken-in Caesars Forum.

MGM’s acquisition of The Cosmopolitan gives it 3000 recently renovated rooms right near where MGM had envisioned another hotel tower.

Remember the Harmon Hotel the 400-room building with an additional 267 condominium residences and a spa?

It was the last planned property at CityCenter but it was doomed by construction defects and unceremoniously dismantled instead of being imploded like so many classic Vegas resorts. A court case in a civil lawsuit relieved both MGM and its contractor of paying what probably would have been a nine-figure settlement.

One other outcome of MGM’s purchase is that it blocked a potential new Strip competitor. It’s been well-reported that a potential buyer for a place on the Strip is Hard Rock International a gaming company owned by Florida’s Seminole Indian Tribe.

The Seminoles are looking to make a bid to be the third tribal entity to take up residency in Las Vegas but they want to be on Las Vegas Boulevard unlike the off-Strip Virgin Hotels Las Vegas — casino operated by Mohegan Gaming and Entertainment — and the Palms being purchased by the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians of California. Incidentally the San Manuel group made a big move this month hiring a former MGM executive Cynthia Kiser Murphey as its general manager once that transaction closes later this year.

As luck would have it the CEOs of Hard Rock International Jim Allen and MGM Bill Hornbuckle will join Wynn Resorts Ltd. CEO Matt Maddox on the same stage Wednesday for a panel discussion on gaming issues at the Global Gaming Expo.

Here’s hoping they talk about some of these deals that are transforming the Strip.

It’s not often an unknown player ventures to Las Vegas enters a five-figure buy-in mixed-game tournament against the world’s best players and comes out on top to win more than half a million dollars. But that’s exactly what happened in just the second event of the 2021 World Series of Poker (WSOP).

Event #2: $25000 H.O.R.S.E. attracted 78 runners and offered up a $1842750 prize pool including a $552182 top prize. After three days of play 44-year-old Jesse Klein emerged victorious over a stacked final table – one representing a combined 22 gold bracelets – to etch his name in poker history.

2021 WSOP Event #2: $25000 H.O.R.S.E. Final Table Results

Position Winner Country Prize (in USD) 1 Jesse Klein United States $552182 2 Benny Glaser United Kingdom $341274 3 David Benyamine France $236626 4 Chad Eveslage United States $169218 5 Philip Sternheimer United Kingdom $124935 6 Phil Hellmuth United States $95329 7 Ben Yu United States $75260 8 DJ Buckley United States $61549 9 Matt Glantz United States $52211

Klein who hails from the Philadelphia area flew out on Thursday with the sole intention of playing the first big buy-in tournament of the series. The owner of a recruiting business the father of two hasn’t cashed a tournament since 2010 due to one reason he prefers to play high-stakes mixed cash games.

Despite not having played a lot lately due to the pandemic the allure of the $25K H.O.R.S.E. was too much to resist.

“I just came out here to play this event and go home Sunday” said Klein who according to The Hendon Mob had just $23100 in lifetime earnings before the win. “I have a wife and two kids – a six-year-old girl and a three-year-old son. I came out here to play this event and that’s it. Maybe I’ll come back out here since I won this.”

Klein continued: “I’m feeling great. It was a lot of fun. The players were awesome it was an awesome structure. I’m feeling good. I play poker to win but I don’t play poker professionally. The H.O.R.S.E. event is what I wanted to play. I love all the different games. It’s just fun.”

Not only did Klein check off “winning a WSOP gold bracelet” off his bucket list but he also checked off “Tilting the Poker Brat.”

Phil Hellmuth

“That was great that was phenomenal. I’ve never played with him before” Klein said in regards to Phil Hellmuth who was seeking his record-extending 16th bracelet. “In a Razz hand he limped and I completed. I made a nine and I think he made a ten he just went off and I loved it. It made me laugh all that kind of stuff cracks me up. It’s part of the entertainment I guess.”

Hellmuth wasn’t the only bracelet winner Klein contended with on his way to claiming his own. He also outlasted three-time winners Ben Yu and Benny Glaser as well as bracelet winner and World Poker Tour (WPT) champ David Benyamine.

“I’m not intimidated ever playing poker” Klein said confidently. “When you’re comfortable playing different games you just play your game. You try not to get too high or too low just stay steady.”

After the final hand Klein called his wife who shed some tears of joy.

“I’ve got a gold bracelet. I’m fired up. I love playing poker” Klein said with a smile. “This event was about as competitive as can be. A perfect little couple of days.”

The Road to Victory for Klein

Klein entered the final table second in chips trailing only Glaser and was always near the top of the leaderboard except for a brief spell during which he dropped into the middle of the pack. The momentum started to shift towards Klein when he won a Razz pot against Hellmuth who needed a while to calm down again.

By then the field was already down to the final six players with the departures of Matt Glantz DJ Buckley and Yu. Hellmuth never recovered from the fatal blow to his stack and bowed out in sixth place. Right after Philip Sternheimer became the next casualty in a seven-card Stud hand and Chad Eveslage followed shortly thereafter as Glaser notched up his second knockout in a row.

Three-handed play saw Glaser move into a solid lead but the tides turned in favor of Klein when he claimed back-to-back Razz pots against the Brit. From there on Klein pulled further ahead and as the limits moved up both Benyamine and Glaser succumbed to their short stacks.

Congratulations to Jesse Klein winner of the 2021 WSOP Event #2: $25000 H.O.R.S.E.!

In a burst of multibillion-dollar deals Las Vegas has seen investors pay mountains of money the past few years to own high-profile casino-resorts.

Those sales have also shown what casino operators — well one in particular — are willing to pay to rent these properties.

MGM Resorts International has reached deals since fall 2019 to lease Bellagio MGM Grand Mandalay Bay Aria Vdara and as announced this week The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.

Its initial annual rent ranges from $200 million for The Cosmopolitan to $292 million for MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay.

All but one of the deals involved sale-leasebacks that netted MGM a fortune in proceeds including more than $4 billion for Bellagio alone. Moreover all of the deals involved the same company on the other side of the table New York financial giant Blackstone which has been gobbling up real estate in Southern Nevada for years.

Still the nine-figure rental rates show what MGM is willing to pay to keep running its properties and to take over another towering resort on the Strip The Cosmopolitan without buying its real estate.

A landlord and tenant determine a casino-resort’s rental rate based on a property’s earnings stability market and possible corporate guarantee according to Truist Securities analyst Barry Jonas.

When MGM announced in July that it was selling Aria and Vdara to Blackstone for nearly $3.9 billion in cash and renting them back it noted the sales price was a little over 18 times its rent which initially is $215 million a year.

At the time Tyler Henritze head of real estate acquisitions in the Americas for Blackstone said such deals were attractive for several reasons including “long-term leases with stable cash flows and no capital expenditure obligations and in this case a full corporate guaranty of rent payments from a best-in-class operator.”

After Blackstone purchased multiple MGM-operated properties on the Strip it’s now selling The Cosmopolitan for $5.65 billion. As part of the deal MGM is acquiring the resort’s operations side for more than $1.6 billion and leasing the property from a group of owners.

MGM did not respond to a request for comment Friday on its rental rates.

The casino chain has made a fortune selling its real estate as part of its “asset-light” strategy though as with any deal there are risks to leasing a resort rather than owning the property outright.

Jonas for one noted there is a “finality” to selling a building and losing control over it.

Plus as Macquarie Capital analyst Chad Beynon pointed out tenants “always owe that rent” and have to set aside money every year to pay their landlord.

Even after the coronavirus pandemic sparked catastrophic job losses and led to nationwide casino closures turning the Strip into a ghost town for a while casino landlords came out OK.

One major landlord is now buying another in a $17 billion-plus deal.

Caesars Entertainment spinoff Vici Properties announced in August that it was acquiring MGM Resorts spinoff MGM Growth Properties putting real estate ownership of many of Las Vegas’ biggest hotel-casinos under one company.

After the deal was announced Vici chief executive Edward Pitoniak said the two casino landlords had collected “100 percent of our rent so far through COVID on time and in cash.”

But there are a few everyday items that may not be top of mind when we regularly clean including what's in our wallets.

When buying groceries grabbing takeout or making any other purchase we're likely to touch our credit cards. Whether you're tapping to pay swiping your card or inserting the chip that means your card is touching surfaces that hundreds of other people's credit cards have also touched recently.

You may or may not have thought of cleaning your cards but disinfecting them periodically can avoid the accumulation of germs from forming.

Here's our useful guide on how to clean your credit cards effectively.

How to clean your credit cards

Fortunately disinfecting your credit cards isn't a complicated process and you can do so with everyday household items.

The easiest way to clean your cards is by using the same technique you use for your hands: soap and warm water. Like washing your hands you should lightly rub for at least 20 seconds. You can sing ""Happy Birthday"" twice through or get more creative — Dolly Parton's ""Jolene"" has a chorus that lasts 20 seconds as does Beyonce's ""Love on Top."" I'm a fan of using the chorus to the song ""My Shot"" from Hamilton.

You can also use one of the EPA-approved disinfectants against COVID-19 which includes many household wipes and sprays such as Clorox. For the tech lover you can use a UV sterilizer since UV rays kill viruses and bacteria. Keep in mind that your signature may wash off the card when you use soap or a disinfectant. You can always resign the card if this happens.

Soap and water is a simple effective way to clean your credit cards. (Photo by Isabelle Raphael/The Points Guy)

Will disinfectants damage my credit card?

Short answer? No.

Credit cards both plastic and metal are made to be waterproof. Your card should also be able to withstand products such as bleach vinegar or alcohol. I don't recommend soaking your cards in any corrosive liquids but a quick wipe-down with a Clorox wipe or a 20-second wash with some soap and water won't render them unusable.

In fact keeping your cards clean could help them stand the test of time. Dirt and grime can build up on your cards which can scrape at EMV chips and magnetic strips. It's not a good idea to scrub your cards with an abrasive of any kind but a gentle cleaning can help keep dirt from building up while killing germs — two birds one Clorox wipe.

Tips for using card readers and pin pads

Even if your cards are fully disinfected you might have to interact with germy apparatuses such as card readers and pin pads that you use to make payments at stores. In the U.S. chip-and-signature is the most common authorization method for payments. This means that even if you have a contactless card you might need to use a stylus your finger or a pen to sign your signature. Those surfaces have been touched by anyone who came before you.

The best thing you can do is immediately disinfect your hands after you pay and avoid touching your face (which is a best practice you should be following anyway).

Bottom line

As the pandemic lingers on there's been a greater emphasis on cleanliness and disinfecting whenever possible. When it comes to your credit cards good ole' soap and water will do the job just fine or you can use a disinfectant to gently wipe down your cards after you use them.

After all it could also be of tremendous value to you in the future. Anyone at any time can join the disability community so by making the world more inclusive now you can help future generations as well.

Did you know that approximately one in four people have a disability? By encouraging destinations to be inclusive of all travelers and speaking up if accessibility is limited in a tourist site you are not only potentially helping yourself for the future but you are also helping your extended family friends and everyone in general.

Below is a list of ways you can be the best ally to disabled travelers. As a wheelchair user myself I thank you for taking the time to read this article and taking the actions below.

Support legislation that improves accessibility

The Air Carrier Access Act prohibits discrimination by air carriers against individuals with disabilities. The ACAA has provided regulations for 35 years but it is in need of an update. Currently the Air Carrier Access Amendments Act is trying to be passed in congress. It would strengthen enforcement of the ACAA require airlines to meet accessibility standards and most importantly improve the safety of air travel for passengers with disabilities. You can ask your members of Congress to support this bill by filling out this simple form online.

The airline industry is very aware of the rights of disabled passengers but as stressors arise in the airport there may be times that fairness is overlooked. If you are on a plane or in an airport and see someone in a wheelchair being treated unfairly remind the airline of the ACAA.

Support organizations that are working to make travel more accessible

All Wheels Up for example is an incredible organization that is pushing for wheelchair users to be able to remain in their wheelchair during flight.

Currently the wheelchair is stowed beneath the plane and the wheelchair user has to be transferred from their wheelchair into a small ""aisle chair"" and then again transferred into the plane seat. This makes the flight very uncomfortable as most wheelchairs are custom-fitted. The wheelchairs also are often damaged during flight (an average of 29 wheelchairs are damaged per day on flights) which not only causes the wheelchair user days weeks or even months of discomfort and immobility but also costs the airline millions of dollars every year in repairs.

By donating to organizations like All Wheels Up travelers of all abilities will one day be able to enjoy flying without the stress of being manhandled by the airline crew members or having a wheelchair damaged. Every dollar that is donated to All Wheels Up goes toward improving the air travel process for wheelchair users.

Speak up when you see inaccessibility while traveling

You've probably heard the phrase ""When you see something say something"" right? Well this is one of the best and easiest things that you as an able-bodied traveler can do to help improve accessibility in the destinations you visit.

For example if you are walking up stairs into a restaurant ask a worker if there is another entrance for wheelchair users. You may get them thinking about accessibility for the first time just by asking that simple question. They may have never even thought about this scenario before. Often the workers will even say ""Well we never have customers in wheelchairs here so we really do not need a ramp"" but remind them that wheelchair users may have tried to visit but cannot due to the inaccessibility.

By speaking up about accessibility in a kind manner you could be the reason why a restaurant shop or attraction becomes accessible.

Share accessibility insights online

When writing about your travel experiences post-trip whether on TripAdvisor Yelp your own social media pages or somewhere else on the internet always include info on accessibility of the location you're writing about.

Accessible travel information is often extremely difficult to find online but even if you just put one sentence saying that whatever attraction you visited had a ramp to enter that could be a huge help. You don't have to go into full accessibility detail but any bit of information is super helpful.

Related: Planning an accessible trip? These travel resources can help.

The more accessibility information that we can make available online the easier trips will be to plan in the future and the more mainstream accessibility will become.

Use accessible travel companies to plan your own trips

Use accessible travel booking platforms like Handiscover to book hotel rooms or use accessibility-focused tour companies to help support them. Sure sites like Handiscover do specialize in accessibility but they also allow you to book standard rooms.

Likewise many companies that offer accessible tours also offer tours for non-disabled travelers. However the opposite is not usually true. By supporting tour companies and booking platforms that cater to all travelers instead of spending your hard-earned money on discriminatory companies this puts more money in the pockets of inclusive companies and therefore they will be able to provide better accessible features to accommodate wheelchair users.

As you can see there are multiple ways that you can be an ally for disabled travelers and none of the above scenarios take away from your own travel experiences. They are just helping to improve travel for people of all abilities. By being an ally you will not only improve the lives of others but it could also improve your outlook on travel and enable you to have a more fulfilling trip.

This is Marriott's latest move in the Iceland market near the heart of Reykjavik's city center next to the Harpa Concert Hall. It's one of the few true five-star properties in the city. The hotel was announced back in 2015 and originally supposed to open in 2018 but was continiously pushed back. The hotel is currently accepting reservations starting Oct. 12 2021. It will be Marriott's fifth hotel in Iceland.

The hotel features a full suite of amenities including an Icelandic restautant bar nightlife space rooftop spa and a gym. It boasts 253 rooms and suites which is massive by Icelandic hotel standards. Plus its amenities and central location are sure to make the property a destination for guests and locals alike.

For those unfamiliar Edition is one of Marriott's ""Distinctive Luxury"" brands that aims to offer unique food accommodation and entertainment under one roof. It's a small yet fast-growing Marriott brand with eight new properties set to open by the end of the year.

While you can earn and redeem Marriott Bonvoy points at Edition properties you cannot use many elite status benefits. For example you can't redeem Suite Night Awards (SNA) certificates and free breakfast isn't included.

room rates and points cost

Like most things in Iceland rooms aren't cheap. Standard room rates at the Marriott Edition start around 53438 ISK per night this November equal to roughly $410 after conversion. On the other hand an Ocean View Corner Suite can cost as much as 375000 ISK ($2876) per night.

Those hoping to use Marriott Bonvoy points to book a room should note it is a Category 8 property. This is the most expensive award category — rooms cost 70000 points per night on off-peak dates 85000 points per night on standard dates and 100000 points per night on peak dates.

Bottom line

It's great to see the Reykjavik Edition open its doors — even if it's a few years late. The hotel is one of TPG's most anticipated hotel openings of the year and it marks a change in the Reyjavik hotel scene. Most hotels in Reykjavik are nice but no-frills. And this makes sense: for tourists the city is generally a jumping-off point for the rest of Iceland.

Travelers often go to the country to experience all its various outdoor activities. Opening a high-end property in the city shows that the city is now a destination in itself and has a world-class hotel to prove it. As a Marriott loyalist myself I'm excited to get back to Iceland someday soon to check out the property."

From cooking classes in the Carnival Kitchen to a relaxing afternoon on the Serenity Deck or Loft 19 we’ve got plenty of ideas for you to schedule some ‘kid-free’ time onboard the new Mardi Gras.

Take the kids over to the popular Camp Ocean trust me they’ll be excited about it and get ready to choose your own definition of ‘fun’ onboard the brand new Mardi Gras.

(Note: Check hours of operation as Camp Ocean is limited or closed during restart.)

Let’s take a look at the unique ways you can enjoy a parents getaway while cruising while never being too far away from the kids.

Let’s Get Cooking

Inside the new Carnival Kitchen on Deck 6 Aft couples can learn new skills from the culinary pros experience some great food and take your knowledge home with you too.

Choose from hands-on classes focused on cupcake decorating or tailgating favorites or step outside your comfort zone and learn how to make sushi rolls. Sign up for these lessons in advance as the popular classes tend to book up quickly.

Cheers to You!

For more hands-on fun sign up early for the Alchemy Bar’s popular Martini Tasting experience. Learn about martinis and mixing drinks from the professionals behind the bar while you sample four mini-martinis.

Drinks on the menu include the popular Spicy Pineapple Chipotle Martini the pomegranate-inspired 40 is the New 20 martini and a Cucumber Sunrise to name a few.

At the end of the experience choose one full-sized martini to celebrate the end of class. You’ll get to know the bartenders and fellow cruisers during this experience and you might even discover a ‘new to you’ favorite drink too!

Visit the Ultimate Playground

For those ready for outdoor fun make your way up to Deck 18 on the Mardi Gras to the Ultimate Playground where you’ll find BOLT the Ultimate Sea Coaster.

This wild motorcycle-style coaster soars high above the ship and two people can ride at the same time making it a great way to get your adrenaline running on your ‘no kids’ outing. Then challenge your partner to a game of mini-golf or test your skills on the Ropes Course at SportSquare.

Dinner and a Movie

Camp Ocean hosts dinner for kid campers each night on the Lido deck meaning parents can enjoy a quiet dinner on their own – so take advantage of it!

Enjoy dinner for two in the Main Dining Room or book reservations at one of the ship’s new restaurants. ChiBang! features Mexican and Chinese dishes or make it a seafood night at Rudi’s SeaGrill.

Other popular spots for dinner include Fahrenheit 555 Steakhouse ($39 per guest) and Emeril’s Bistro 1396 (a la carte).

Afterward make your way out to the Lido Deck and curl up in a blanket under the stars to enjoy the night’s Dive-In Movie.

Complete with popcorn late-night movies typically include adult favorites and earlier timed movies are more family-friendly. Select nights on the Lido Deck include a dance party so be sure to check the HUB app for the schedule.

Meet Up For Drinks

There’s no shortage of spots to catch up with your partner over drinks on the Mardi Gras including quite a few new places.

Make your way over to the onboard Summer Landing zone on Deck 8 Aft where you’ll find Guy’s Pig and Anchor Smokehouse | Brewhouse with Parched Pig craft beer brewed right on the ship. Enjoy live music at night and step outside to enjoy the views at The Watering Hole along with a drink or two.

The Brass Magnolia and the Fortune Teller Bar located in the French Quarter zone on Deck 6 Aft are both new to Carnival Cruise Line and are quickly becoming popular with their live music scene and creative drinks respectively.

At The Brass Magnolia grab a drink at the bar such as the legendary Hurricane cocktail and enjoy a performance from the live jazz trio. You’ll feel like you’ve stepped foot into the garden district of New Orleans.

Nearby at the Fortune Teller Bar surround yourself with the mystery and elegance that make up the bar. Drinks here are creative and some would say supernatural.

Try the Golden Galaxy made with bits of real gold or the new Abracadabra cocktail that changes colors right before your eyes. These festive cocktails make for a fun night onboard Mardi Gras.

Relax and Rejuvenate

If a quiet afternoon with a book and maybe a nap is more your idea of the perfect ‘date day’ on Mardi Gras make plans to reserve your own cabana (starting at $500 per day for up to eight people) at the new Loft 19. In a private cabana guests receive exceptional service including chilled towels fruit trays lunch delivery right to the cabana and attentive concierge service.

Enjoy a soak in the infinity whirlpool and spend the day relaxing while someone else is in charge. While there is an additional fee for this area along with reserving a cabana (and they go quickly!) those in Carnival Excel-level suites enjoy complimentary access to Loft 19 along with priority booking access for cabana reservations.

The Serenity Retreat aka the adults-only deck is another great place to enjoy a quiet afternoon with your partner. Enjoy a bite to eat at the nearby salad bar and grab a fruity umbrella drink at the Serenity bar to top off a relaxing day at sea.

For some pampering book a couples massage at the Cloud 9 Spa for you and your partner. You’ll feel refreshed and revived after letting someone else be in charge. From hot stone massages to deep tissue massages wrap up your spa treatment with a soak in the Cloud 9 Spa Thalassotherapy Pool.

No matter what type of activity you choose to be your ‘fun’ onboard Carnival Cruise Line’s new Mardi Gras you can feel thankful and happy knowing that the kids had a great time at Camp Ocean and that you enjoyed a day “off” enjoying your vacation with your partner.

What sounds like the ultimate ‘parents-only’ adventure for you onboard Mardi Gras?

Bumper cars were one of the activities at the Pontiac site. (United Wholesale Mortgage)

Pontiac students got a special invitation from United Wholesale Mortgage on Friday.

For the first time UWM opened its annual company fair to about 900 K-12 students from the Arts & Technology Academy of Pontiac (ATAP) getting unlimited access to carnival rides including coasters a Ferris wheel and bumper cars. Students also received free tickets to play different games.

UWM began its partnership with ATAP two years ago providing students access to the company’s drive-in movie theater on select days; lending UWM security services during some school days; participating in reading events; providing access to the UWM Sport Complex for the football team; and hosting ATAP’s 2021 commencement ceremony at the UWM Sports Complex for free.

The fair offered annually by UWM to team members and their families took place on the company’s campus in Pontiac.

“We love our community like we love our own and we’re thrilled to open up our fair to these Pontiac students” said Laura Lawson chief people officer at UWM. “This is the first time we’ve ever opened up the fair to community members and we’re going to continue to find ways to give back to not only these students but other residents throughout metro Detroit.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL2NydWlzZS1uZXdzLXVwZGF0ZS1vY3RvYmVyLTItMjAyMS81NzI1MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruise News Update: October 2 2021,"We’ve got you covered with another cruise news update covering the major cruise lines. It’s been a busy one as more ships resume operations in the U.S. and a huge demand for a Carnival cruise to Greenland.

Here we go with another cruise news update and of course it’s just another busy week in the cruise industry. We’ve got updates on Disney Cruise Line resuming sailings from San Diego Winter protocols from MSC Cruises second Carnival cruise ship begins sailings from Long Beach limited testing at terminals from Royal Caribbean Carnival’s Halloween plan Norwegian Cruise Line resuming from New York City and those high up at Carnival listened as another Greenland cruise is added.

Disney Wonder Restarts from San Diego

Guests are once again enjoying the magic that happens onboard Disney Cruise Line’s Disney Wonder. The vessel is sailing on a 4-day round-trip Halloween On The High Seas cruise from San Diego calling in Cabo San Lucas along with two days at sea.

The vessel departed on Friday October 1 to restart operations. Disney Wonder became the final ship in the fleet to resume and the first in the fleet on the West Coast.

The ship will be sailing on this itinerary for the near future alternating between three and four-day cruises to Baja Mexico. Three-night voyages will stop at the popular port of Ensenada and have a day at sea. The four-night cruises feature two days at sea and a call at Cabo San Lucas.

For the Baja Mexico cruise onboard Wonder all guests age 12 and above must be fully vaccinated and take a test upon embarkation. On November 5 1754-passenger Disney Wonder will sail on a 14-night cruise through the Panama Canal; for this cruise all guests regardless of age must be fully vaccinated to be allowed onboard.

Carnival Miracle Sails from Long Beach

Carnival Miracle has become the second in the fleet to resume sailings out of Long Beach California and it comes after the ship has already been sailing from Seattle Washington to Alaska since the end of July 2021.

On September 27 guests were welcomed on board with a party atmosphere and dancing from the crew in the atrium. The event was hosted by popular cruise director Jen Baxter and attended by the ship’s captain.

Carnival Miracle kicked off its offerings from Long Beach with a four-day Mexican Riviera itinerary. The ship made calls at Avalon at Catalina Island and Ensenada in Mexico. The vessel then returned to its homeport on Friday October 1 2021. The Spirit-class vessel will offer three- and four-day cruises for the remainder of the year.

Carnival Miracle joins Carnival Panorama which became the first to resume from the Port of Long Beach on August 21 2021. The Vista-class vessel is offering week-long cruises to the Mexican Riviera.

MSC Cruises Protocols for Winter

MSC Cruises aims to keep its health and safety measures through the winter season to make sure everyone remains safe onboard. The protocols were first introduced in August 2020 as MSC Cruises was among the earliest cruise lines to resume operations during the pandemic.

So for Caribbean cruises out of Miami and Port Canaveral all guests 12 years and above need to be fully vaccinated. For U.S. residents they will need to provide proof of a negative antigen or PCR test taken within 48 hours of before the cruise departure whilst non-U.S. residents will need a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of their cruise departure.

All guests aged from two years to 11 years will need to provide proof of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of their cruise departure.

We’ve got all the protocols for the different regions MSC Cruises operates in over on the website including the Southern Caribbean Mediterranean Nothern Europe and the Middle East. The Winter season protocols for South America and South Africa are to be released soon.

Carnival Adds Second Greenland Voyage

With such a huge demand for Carnival’s Greenland voyage departing in September 2023 the cruise line has been able to add an additional sailing. The voyage that departs on September 2 from the Port of Baltimore sold out in just 24 hours.

Carnival Cruise Line has now decided to add a second Greenland voyage which departs even earlier on August 13 2023.

On August 22 the ship will make a call at St. Anthony in Newfoundland. There will also be a call at Corner Brook in Newfoundland on August 23 and Sydney in Nova Scotia on August 24 2023. There will be two final days at sea before Carnival Legend arrives back in Baltimore Maryland on August 27.

Carnival Legend is becoming the go-to ship in the fleet for cruises to Greenland. The Spirit-class vessel first made visits to the country in 2013 out of Dover in the UK. The ship is currently preparing to begin sailings and replace sister ship Carnival Pride out of Baltimore on November 14 2021.

Royal Caribbean Terminal Testing

Guests scrambling to make sure they can get tested within the correct timeframe before a cruise will be happy to know that Royal Caribbean has come up with a backup with the “Boarding Day Test” option. The cruise line now offers pre-cruise testing at the terminal but it’s limited and should only really be used if all else fails.

In the email that’s been sent the cruise line starts by saying “Pros: A last option if you simply can’t find a pre-cruise test or could not secure results in time.” it means that guests should only use the terminal testing option if all other testing arrangements don’t work out such as home test kits and at a specific test site.

Royal Caribbean goes on to say in the email “Cons: For vaccinated guests only. Limited availability by appointment only. Wait up to an hour for results outside of terminal. Positive result unknown until boarding day.”

It’s good to know that the cruise line does have an option there if needed and it’s advised by the cruise line to “search out other options first.” Guests can then book an appointment 24 hours in advance for 30-minutes before check-in time. The testing at the terminal will cost at least $99 per person along with waiting outside the terminal for up to an hour for the result.

Royal Navy press release

A fortnight-long international exercise off the Scottish coast put the stamp on two years of intensive training for the Portsmouth-based warship 700-plus crew the Royal Navy and RAF squadrons who will operate aircraft from her flight deck – including the fifth-generation F-35 Lightning stealth fighter – and thousands of military personnel and civilians who support and maintain the endeavour.

It means HMS Prince of Wales can join her sister HMS Queen Elizabeth on the world stage; the latter is currently beginning the second half of her maiden deployment commanding an international carrier strike group in the Pacific.

“We have excitingly jumped the final hurdle and are now a fully-fledged strike carrier ready at 30 days’ notice for operations around the globe” said HMS Prince of Wales’ Commanding Officer Captain Steve Higham.

“This is a significant moment for the ship which will see us operate with fighter jets helicopters drones and other vessel. We’ll achieve all of this by working with our friends and colleagues from the RAF the British Army and across Defence to deliver our contribution for the UK as a problem-solving burden-sharing partner nation.

“The whole Prince of Wales team are grateful for the support of our followers our families and our friends and hope that they keep following us towards our first deployment.”

The carrier’s Senior Warfare Officer Lieutenant Commander David Thompson added: “HMS Prince of Wales is at the end of a challenging yet successful journey on the road to operational readiness. We are prepared to support Commander UK Strike Forces and are relishing the opportunity to work alongside other allied nations.”

The final act of the new carrier’s preparation for operations was participation in the largest military exercise hosted in the UK this autumn.

Thousands of military personnel from a dozen nations took part in the combined UK/NATO exercise Joint Warrior/Dynamic Mariner which ended yesterday testing their abilities individually and collectively to deal with global events.

More than 20 warships and submarines plus maritime patrol aircraft helicopters and thousands of military personnel from a dozen nations are taking part in the fortnight long combined exercise.

Ten Royal Navy vessels plus elements of four Fleet Air Arm squadrons (troop carrying and submarine-hunting Merlins Commando and anti-surface Wildcats and Hawk jets which have decamped from Cornwall to Scotland) Royal Marines of 3 Commando Brigade and the guns of their supporting artillery regiment 29 Commando RA plus senior staffs – around 2000 men and women in all – represented the Senior Service.

Prince of Wales and amphibious flagship HMS Albion led the RN participation joined by frigates HMS Argyll and Lancaster – the latter fresh from operations in the Arctic – tanker RFA Tiderace support ship RFA Mounts Bay minehunter HMS Pembroke and a smattering of P2000 patrol craft.

After a week where the participating units get to know how to work together – there are half a dozen mini task groups operating off the Scottish coast – the exercise shifts up several gears in its second week as participants face wide-ranging challenging scenarios which mirror real-world events such as evacuating civilians from a war zone.

As well as the big-picture challenges other facets of naval operations – gunnery on the range at Cape Wrath board and search/counter-smuggling operations mine warfare and swarm attacks – are all thrown into the exercise to give participants a complete workout.

Besides validating HMS Prince of Wales operationally Joint Warrior has been used to refine the ongoing transformation of the Royal Marines into the Future Commando Force able to rapidly deploy raiding forces when needed.

Staff onboard UK amphibious flagship HMS Albion perfected planning for commando raids which are the heart of the concept as well as honing skills working alongside NATO allies and mastering the art of choreographing an international naval force.

“Providing a command platform for the Amphibious Forces HQ is one of the core roles of HMS Albion” explained Lieutenant Mike Cooper responsible for Albion’s communications and information systems.

“Joint Warrior allows my team to plan and execute embarking a headquarters along with testing the wide array of computer and communication systems on board. Above all the exercise ensures that the UK’s high-readiness amphibious assault ship is prepared for any challenge.”

Beyond testing staffs Joint Warrior exercises every member of the ship’s company: the gunnery team had to fend off assaults from fast attack craft swarming around Albion the flight deck has hosted RAF Chinooks alongside more regularly Royal Navy Wildcats and Merlins and firefighters and damage controls have been put through their paces.

“Large multi-national training exercises like Joint Warrior are fundamental to enhancing our ability to deploy high-readiness military forces to conduct coordinated joint operations” explained HMS Albion’s Commanding Officer Captain Simon Kelly.

“They also give us the opportunity to work alongside NATO allies and partners fostering vital relationships and honing our specialist roles within a large war-style scenario.

“During the exercise we have hosted a joint maritime and land headquarters onboard further developing the littoral strike group concept at the heart of Royal Navy’s Commando Force concept.”

WELLINGTON -- Air New Zealand is asking customers to get ready for international travel by getting vaccinated.

From February 2022 the airline will require customers traveling anywhere on its international network to be fully vaccinated.

""We're getting ready to reconnect with the world and letting customers know what they need to do to be ready to take off when we can"" said Air New Zealand's Chief Executive Officer Greg Foran on Sunday.

Air New Zealand's vaccination requirement will apply to all passengers aged 18 and older arriving or departing New Zealand on an Air New Zealand aircraft. Customers who are not vaccinated will be required to present proof that vaccination was not a viable option for them for medical reasons.

""Being vaccinated against COVID-19 is the new reality of international travel - many of the destinations Kiwis want to visit are already closed to unvaccinated visitors. The quicker we get vaccinated the sooner we can fly Kiwis to places like New York Vancouver and Narita.

""We've been hearing from both customers and employees that this measure is important to them. It came through loud and clear in our recent consultation process with employees and we want to do everything we can to protect them.

Mandating vaccination on our international flights will give both customers and employees the peace of mind that everyone onboard meets the same health requirements as they do"" Foran said.

Besides validating HMS Prince of Wales operationally Joint Warrior has been used to refine the ongoing transformation of the Royal Marines into the Future Commando Force able to rapidly deploy raiding forces when needed.

The HMS Prince of Wales (R09) is the second Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier which is now in service with the British Royal Navy. Construction of the aircraft carrier began in 2011 at Rosyth Dockyard and ended with the launch on 21 December 2017. The completed Prince of Wales began sea trials in September 2019 and first arrived at her new home base of HMNB Portsmouth in November 2019. The ship was formally commissioned into the Royal Navy at a ceremony in Portsmouth on 10 December 2019. She was declared fully operational in October 1 2021.

The HMS Prince of Wales has a length of 280m a beam of 39m a draught of 11m and a displacement of 65000 tons. She is powered by two Rolls-Royce Marine 36MW MT30 gas turbine alternators providing over 70MW and four diesel engines providing approximately 40MW. The ship can reach a top speed of 25 knots (46 km/h) with a maximum cruising range of 10000 nautical miles (19000 km)

As the HMS Queen Elizabeth the HMS Prince of Wales is designed to carry forty aircraft a maximum of 36 F-35B Lightning II stealth multirole fighters and four Merlin helicopters.

For its self-protection the HMS Prince of Wales is armed with three Phalanx CIWS (Close-In Weapon Station) four 30mm remotely operated DS30M Mk2 automatic cannons and six Miniguns."
CTLT,Catalent,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZHRpbWVzb25saW5lLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjEvMTAvMDMvY2F0YWxlbnQtYmxvb21pbmd0b24tam9icy10by1oaXJlLTYwMC81OTIyMTk1MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Catalent Bloomington hiring for entry level jobs at $18 an hour,"Drug maker Catalent plans to hire between 500 and 600 more employees for its Bloomington operations through the end of the year as it is seeing rising demand for its products including COVID-19 vaccines.

The Somerset New Jersey-based company will have job fairs at the Monroe County Convention Center Oct. 12 and 13.

“We have opportunities across the board” said Arturo Lopez senior director of human resources.

Lopez told The Herald-Times Friday that Catalent is hiring for positions ranging from director to supervisor to technicians though the company is looking primarily for entry-level manufacturing and warehousing positions.

Entry-level jobs will pay hourly wages of $18. Employees will get benefits from the start including health insurance and a 401(k) plan with a match of up to 4%. Entry-level applicants must have a high school diploma.

Hiring:Despite recovery more available workers employers are struggling to hire

Lopez said that the company is increasing its production in part because of the continued high need for the COVID-19 vaccines it packages. Catalent expects demand for those vaccines to continue for some time for both initial shots and boosters. Some medical experts expect COVID-19 to remain within the population for years though without causing the kind of disruption it has in the past 18 months.

The pandemic also has left many employers scrambling to find workers and has created some “interesting” market dynamics Lopez said.

Nationwide employers have about 9 million job openings and at the same time about 9 million people are actively looking for work indicating a mismatch between skills that employers need and what job seekers have the training to do he said.

In August nearly 134000 Hoosiers were looking for jobs though that was down from nearly 239000 a year ago according to the Indiana Department of Workforce Development. The state's unemployment rate at 4.1% was down 3.2 percentage points from August 2020.

In the Bloomington area nearly 2800 people were looking for work in August. The unemployment rate was 3.6%.

Despite a “battle for talent” Lopez said he believed Catalent will meet its hiring goal because of its competitive salary and benefits package. While entry level workers earn $18 an hour they can get a pay bump of up to 20% depending on what shifts they work. Hourly and salaried employees also can earn quarterly bonuses of up to 5%. The company’s continued growth also offers opportunities for learning new skills expanded responsibilities and for promotions Lopez said.

Much of the work takes place in areas that are “pretty different” from traditional manufacturing floors Lopez said as Catalent’s industry is highly regulated. Many employees work with protective gear in areas similar to laboratories or hospitals with negative air pressure and tightly controlled air flow and ventilation.

Lopez said many people also enjoy the work because it is meaningful as Catalent’s products improve and save lives.

Laine Mello product manager for biologics said the company also manufactures products to fight flu neurological disorders cardiovascular disease and cancer. According to its annual report the company also provides “cell therapy and viral-based gene therapy development and manufacturing.”

While production demand is being driven primarily by the pandemic Catalent officials said that many of the company’s more than 60 customers are seeing growth.

The publicly traded company recently reported annual revenue of just under $4 billion up 26% from the prior year according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company said revenue increased primarily because of “robust demand across all our Biologics offerings in particular demand for our drug product and drug substance offerings for COVID-19-related programs.”

From March:Bloomington Catalent ready to ship Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccine

Net earnings for the year rose 159% to $585 million. The company’s share price this year has risen 27% and now hovers near $132.

Mello said that while the company is seeing growth across the globe — as of late August it had 17300 employees at 56 facilities on four continents — Bloomington was the “fastest-growing site.”

Since January 2019 the company has invested more than $250 million in Monroe County and Mello said the company expects that figure to climb. The local operations employ about 3500.

The Catalent facility on South Patterson Drive covers about 1 million square feet and parts of it remain vacant or are being used for warehousing she said. As demand for products increases the company renovates the warehousing spaces to turn them into production areas.

The pharmaceutical company last year also spent $14 million to buy a 23000-square-foot manufacturing facility from AB BioTechnologies Inc. at 3770 W. Jonathan Drive.

The job fair will be 3-7 p.m. Oct. 12 and noon-7 p.m. Oct. 13 at the Monroe Convention Center. Applicants should bring a resume. No appointments are necessary. You can also apply online.

By Hsu Li-chuan Liu Yu-ching and Jake Chung / Staff reporters with staff writer





Caterpillar hairs blown by a northeast monsoon are causing skin rashes in Penghu County doctors said on Thursday.

Lee Chih-hung (李志宏) of Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital said that when doctors met to discuss an outbreak of rashes on Tuesday 15 out of 21 patients had skin lesions with the earliest case occurring on Friday last week.

The patients do not have the kind of small prickly rashes commonly associated with insect bites or patches of rashes that develop from allergies Lee said.

After Penghu County Department of Health Director Hsiao Ching-jung (蕭靜蓉) said there had been an increase in Taiwan yellow tussock moth larvae doctors determined that the conditions were caused by caterpillar hairs carried by the wind.

While caterpillar hair was not found on the patients it could have already been blown away after causing a reaction Lee said adding that large quantities of caterpillar hair throughout Penghu County could cause rashes.

Chang Chung-hsing (張中興) a physician at Tri-Service General Hospital’s Penghu branch concurred adding that the rashes occurred mostly in areas not covered by clothing.

People with the rashes can run a small gentle stream of water over the affected area to alleviate discomfort or place a cold compress over it he said.

Ointment could help the area heal faster he said adding that for patients with a rash over a large area of skin doctors should consider prescribing antihistamines.

The department said it asked city and township branches to monitor the situation and issued warnings to communities and schools that people should wear long-sleeve clothing to cover as much skin as possible.

This latest clue however hints that maybe she has yet to appear on screens; only contestants from Group A and B have sung so far.

Mariska appeared on the 1989 world tour

Caterpillar will appear in an upcoming episode and the character's connection to Taylor could suggest Mariska because her SVU character Olivia Benson was the inspiration behind Taylor naming her cat Olivia.

The actress also appeared on stage with Taylor during her 1989 world tour and in the music video for Bad Blood.

Caterpillar's costume is bright pink and yellow with a beaming smile - and it also fits with the name of Mariska's non-profit The Joyful Heart Foundation.

Taylor named her cat after Olivia Benson

Founded in 2004 Joyful Heart is a leading national organization with a mission to transform society’s response to sexual assault domestic violence and child abuse support survivors’ healing and end this violence forever.

Mariska has been playing NYPD officer Olivia Benson in Law and Order: Special Victims Unit for 23 seasons and counting; it is the longest running network TV drama of all time.

The star is the only daughter of American actress Jayne Mansfield and Hungarian bodybuilder Mickey Hargitay.

Jayne was a major sex symbol during the 1950s and early 1960s and known for her roles in the films The Girl Can't Help It and Too Hot To Handle. Mariska's father was just as well known having been crowned Mr Universe in 1955.

Princess Beatrice is the only royal to run London Marathon - and she even set a record

The London Marathon is the ultimate test of endurance and super-fit runners will be trying to finish the 26-mile course today in the fastest possible time.

There are several sporty members of the royal family who could take part however only one has actually completed the London Marathon - and not only did she finish the route she also set a record.

That royal is Princess Beatrice who ran the race in 2010 for her mother Sarah Ferguson's charity Children in Crisis.

Beatrice was one of 34 runners who joined together to form a human caterpillar and were tied to each other while running the route.

Among the others taking were part were her then-boyfriend Dave Clarke and friends Sam and Holly Branson.

Beatrice donned a fluorescent tutu and sweatbands for the race and was pictured cheering with her medal after crossing the finishing line.

And impressively the group broke the record for being the most people to finish a marathon while tied together.

However today it is likely Beatrice will give the marathon a miss and be at home with her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi caring for their two-week-old daughter.

One royal who is unlikely to do the marathon any time soon is the Duchess of Cambridge.

Sporty Kate is often seen at engagements trying her hand at all sorts of activities from running to tennis - and even abseiling.

Image: PA) PA)

But it seems that taking part in the famous long-distance run in the English capital is one sporting event that she won't be taking part in even if she wanted to.

Journalist Bryony Gordon who has met Kate and completed the marathon revealed she asked her if she would consider doing it.

But Bryony told Runner's World : ""I can’t remember exactly what happened but I was like ‘Are you going to run the marathon?’

Image: Getty Images) Getty Images)

""And she was like ‘Oh I can’t because security is a bit difficult.’ But I was like ‘Sure yeah yeah good excuse. If I can do it anyone can.'""

Despite not being able to take part Kate did attend the 2017 London Marathon when her mental health cause Heads Together was one of the main charities for that year - although she didn't do any running."

The health food start-up said it’s also recruiting an additional 10 staff in response to “the phenomenal demand” for its products.

James Hutchinson who owns the company with Gary Milligan said the expansion represented “a substantial investment” for the food firm which was incorporated just over two years ago.

The company is now supplying the likes of Spar Centra and SuperValu as well as fitness facilities and gyms. A home delivery service is also in operation.

Lisa McAteer from property firm CBRE who acted on behalf of the landlord Titanic Quarter Ltd said there is currently a shortage of quality warehouse sites in Northern Ireland at present.

“There has been huge competition for quality industrial and logistics units in Northern Ireland over the last year and a half which has led to an increased demand for manufacturing storage and distribution space.

“We are thrilled to have helped facilitate this exciting phase of expansion for Go Pig or Go Home as the business up-scales to a new warehouse facility in Belfast. Moving to this new premises in Titanic Quarter’s Channel Commercial Park will support Go Pig or Go Home’s ambitious plans for future business growth.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

As Cisco aims to grow its business the $230 billion company's sprawling network of resellers has proven to be its ""not-so-secret weapon"" to keep its sales engine running as it undergoes the largest business transformation in its 37-year history.

Cisco relies on the hundreds of resellers in its partner program to win contracts with tens of thousands of clients globally ranging from large enterprises to small businesses. All told Cisco's partners account for 90% of the company's bookings which totalled $49.8 billion in the company's most recent fiscal year.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Insider has compiled a list of Cisco's most important partners as it aims to drive more revenue from software and subscriptions. The list which you can read in full below was drawn from Wall Street analysts conversations with Cisco executives and the company's previous public statements.

These companies handle some of Cisco's largest contracts and are leading the charge in its business transformation. Notably they span from tech titans like Amazon Web Services which has emerged as one of Cisco's most important allies down to relatively lower-profile firms like UK-based Logicalis which has been working with the firm over the better part of the last three decades.

Cisco is now leaning on its partners to spearhead the company's push beyond its core infrastructure business into newer lines of business around software and subscriptions. Earlier this year Cisco revamped its partner compensation structure to more heavily reward resellers for closing deals around its subscription-based products that generate recurring revenue.

""Partners enable Cisco to deliver the right business solutions to our customers"" Cisco chief customer and partner officer Gerri Elliot said during the company's investor day last month adding that partners are ""laser focused on continuing to transform how we go to market and continuing to put even more emphasis on driving recurring revenue.""

Analysts also say that the partner network gives Cisco an edge against a rising tide of competition including a crop of startups as well as more established firms like Microsoft Juniper Networks.

""Cisco's biggest competitive advantage is the fact that it has so many feet on the street and the fact that they own the relationship with the biggest channel partners out there"" Jim Fish director and senior research analyst at Piper Sandler told Insider.

The quesadilla marks the first customizable entree Chipotle has added to its menu since it debuted a salad option 17 years ago.

The Hand-Crafted Quesadilla features Monterey Jack cheese and responsibly raised chicken steak carnitas barbacoa sofritas or fajita vegetables folded into a preservative-free flour tortilla. The quesadilla is pressed using a new custom oven in Chipotle’s Digital Kitchen which melts the cheese and enables restaurants to make quesadillas more quickly and conveniently Chipotle said. The quesadilla is cut into triangular pieces and served in 100% compostable packaging that allows customers to choose three salsas or sides.

“We’re so excited to answer the call from fans and introduce one of the most highly anticipated menu items in our brand's history” said Chris Brandt chief marketing officer for Chipotle. “The Hand-Crafted Quesadilla brings so many new possibilities to our menu and fans will love exploring fresh flavor combinations through its sides and salsa options.”

Chipotle began testing a quesadilla as a digital-only menu item in the summer of 2020. This pilot conducted in Cleveland and Indianapolis was part of the brand's stage-gate process which allows Chipotle to study customer feedback and iterate before deciding on a national launch strategy. Chipotle previously leveraged its stage-gate process to introduce Cauliflower Rice Carne Asada Supergreens Salad Mix and Queso Blanco in 2019 and 2020.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbnRlcnByaXNlbmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbGlmZXN0eWxlL2Zvb2QvMjAyMS8xMC8wMy9uYXRpb25hbC10YWNvLWRheS1icm9ja3Rvbi1hcmVhLXJlc3RhdXJhbnRzLWVhc3Rvbi1lYXN0LWJyaWRnZXdhdGVyLWFiaW5ndG9uLXRhdW50b24tc3RvdWdodG9uLzU5NDY4NDAwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,National Taco Day: Restaurants to celebrate near Brockton on Oct. 4,"National Taco Day celebrates the traditional Mexican dish and is celebrated annually on Oct. 4.

A Mexican chain with locations in 31 states has just introduced major menu enhancements that they promise fans will find ""bold"" and ""crave-worthy."" You decide.

Headquartered near Dallas On the Border Grill & Cantina has introduced some fresh upgrades to its contemporary Tex-Mex menu. Starting this past Thursday guests of the chain's locations around the South Midwest and eastern part of the country with a few restaurants on the West Coast will see menu additions that range from cocktail and appetizer upgrades to more tacos and heftier entrees (""more steak on the sizzling plate"" a rep tells Eat This Not That!) as well as a new dessert.

Browse to see what's cooking at On the Border.

Bold new bevs

On The Border has announced the introduction of 10 new hand-crafted Tex-Mex cocktails. These are led by the ultra-premium Diamante Margarita as well as Ranch Water with tequila (with Fever Tree Lime Yuzu soda and fresh lime); and the Maker's 'Rita which features Maker's Mark shaken with fresh citrus sour.

A Refreshing Cucumber and Jalapeño Margarita Recipe

For starters…

The appetizer menu now features a honey chipotle shrimp dish served up with a spicy avocado ranch dip plus a more flavorful kick to what they say is their fan-favorite Tortilla Soup.

Tacos & Fajitas

The chain has introduced this ""Texas-sized"" Smokehouse Fajita dish which comes with chipotle ribs jalapeño sausage braised carnitas and shredded beef brisket. (At 2530 calories and a near-$40 price tag this one might be a sharer.)

On the Border has also brought in a couple new taco concepts like Tacos Al Pastor with braised carnitas and pineapple salsa.

Tortas

Lovers of Mexican food know a torta means a mean sandwich typically on crusty bolillo rolls—like these: A Monterey Ranch Chicken Torta with mesquite-grilled chicken and crumbled bacon and a Braised Carnitas Torta topped with shredded cabbage and creamy red sauce.

The Loaded Queso Burger

It's loaded it's queso it's a burger. We might bet On the Border's new Loaded Queso Burger topped with pickled jalapeños and tortilla strips is likely to be a hit. (It's also a reported 1520 calories just for reference.)

Tres Leches cake

The chain describes their debut of this traditional Mexican dessert as ""a light cake soaked in three kinds of sweet milk.""6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Heads-up on all the above: We're fans of big flavor—just be aware that besides the cocktails at 750 calories per serving the Tres Leches appears to be the lowest-calorie dish of On the Border's new menu intros.

So the blood center will have a blood drive 3-7 p.m. Thursday in the lower level center court at the Southlake Mall at U.S. 30 and Mississippi Street in Hobart. The mall will give a $15 gift card to Whispers Coffee and Tea to anyone who donates.

Updated May 10 2024

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is sending humanitarian aid to those affected by the recent rains in Brazil’s southern state of Rio Grande do Sul.

In what authorities consider the state’s worst-ever crisis caused by natural disasters the extreme flooding has forced 200000 people out of their homes and at least 90 people dead and more than 130 missing.

The Brazil Area Presidency has assembled staff and resources to assist those affected by the floods. A letter sent to bishops and stake presidents from Elder Joni L. Koch Brazil Area President and his counselors Elder Arnulfo Valenzuela and Elder Mark D. Eddy all General Authority Seventies states that 21 meetinghouses are now being used as shelters for evacuated people and thousands of basic food packages provided by the Church to the state Civil Defense have already begun to be distributed to the population.

Other humanitarian aid initiatives are underway in close coordination with the government to help the community. The Church’s Welfare and Self-Reliance and Family Services departments are coordinating support and efforts to meet the needs of members as well.

On Wednesday May 8 missionaries from the Church helped unload emergency supplies from an Azul airplane at the military airport in the city of Canoas.

In Saõ Paulo on Thursday May 9 Elder Koch and Elder Valenzuela closely monitored the loading onto an Azul aircraft of 6 tons of supplies purchased by the Church for flood victims bound for the Canoas Air Base. In a social media post on the Church’s official Brazil account the leaders stated that in addition to the donations was “an immeasurable amount of love and sincere prayers for the people of Rio Grande do Sul.” On Friday May 10 Brazil’s first lady Rosângela Lula da Silva wrote her Instagram page: “I want to thank Azul [Airlines] and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who performed alongside FAB [Brazilian Air Force] and were able to get the donations we received to Canoas. ... There were mattresses vacuum cleaners toilet kits blankets among other items.” She said Brazil is united in its support of Rio Grande do Sul.

News reports say some 80% of the population is without running water right now a week into the flooding. Many also do not have telephone or internet services.

The airport bus station and main roads are all blocked or closed going into the capital of Porto Alegre — and more than two-thirds of the nearly 500 cities in the state are affected by the flood waters. Field hospitals have been set up to help those affected.

Social media posts on the Church’s Autossuficiência Brasil and Brazil Area accounts of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints further explain how the Church is responding to the disaster which include the following list of donated goods and services:

5000-plus basic food baskets

5000-plus mattresses pillows bedding and blankets

48000 liters of drinking water

5000 hygiene and cleaning kits

400 water filters

Additional humanitarian funds

These donations are being coordinated in collaboration with the State Civil Defense. Local church leaders are also coordinating efforts to help the community.

“[T]he Brazil Area office is mobilized to do everything possible to help and help the population of Rio Grande do Sul our dear brothers and sisters and friends at this time of great sorrow” the post said in Portuguese.

The post states that Church members who want to make donations to those affected by the calamity can do so through official government organizations that are coordinating donations through civil defense and social funds.

In addition the Church’s Family Services department is coordinating a support network of volunteer psychologists to provide emotional support to those affected. And wards and stakes across the country have joined the Church’s Helping Hands volunteer program and are raising donations.

A statement from the Brazil Area presidency said “We pray that as we follow the perfect example of Jesus Christ ‘our hands may become His hands; our eyes His eyes and our hearts His heart’ at this time when our brothers and sisters need us so much.”

Some of the cities in Rio Grande do Sul — roughly the size Ecuador — were already suffering from at least three previous major floods in less than eight months.

The rains are expected to continue in the area along with high winds.

During a daylong Commission on Chicago Landmarks hearing dozens who back landmarking St. Adalbert Church provided fiery testimony and characterized the Archdiocese of Chicago and the nearby parish that now oversees the church property as greedy and disrespectful of St. Adalbert’s heritage.

Anina Jakubowski joined many of the landmark supporters in the crowd in saying she placed her hopes not just in the church receiving protected status but in a dream that the church which closed in 2019 might one day reopen. Jakubowski grew up attending masses at St. Adalbert and her mother fought a planned closure of the church in 1974 Jakubowski said.

“It was built as a house of God” said Jakubowski now a Downers Grove resident. “How can you have so many thousands of people who have been in that church and prayed? Where do those prayers go?”

But archdiocese leaders said they opposed the protective designation because it would create restrictions so strict that the church building could become stuck in disrepair and cost the nearby St. Paul Parish that inherited St. Adalbert’s assets millions of dollars in upkeep costs.

“The future vitality of St. Paul’s depends on its ability to use all of the resources it owns including the assets of the closed St. Adalbert’s parish” said Bishop Robert Lombardo who called the potential landmark status “an offense to our right to religious self governance.”

The landmarks commission did not vote on whether it would recommend a landmark designation for St. Adalbert but is scheduled to do so June 6. If the recommendation is made the landmark status question would go to the full City Council for final approval. The status would trigger a series of restrictions on what could be done to the church building and landmarks commission reviews of any redevelopment plans in order to protect the church complex’s “significant features” — including its Renaissance Revival facade. Still a landmarks designation would not completely ban renovations and interior changes.

The church was called “one of the finest in Chicago” by the Tribune when it was completed in 1914 and at its peak served 4000 families. But its membership declined as Pilsen shifted from a more heavily Polish community to predominantly Mexican said Dan Klaiber a Department of Planning and Development coordination planner.

Protesters many of them proudly Polish have ardently pushed back since the archdiocese shut down the church five years ago. They decried the removal of a statue from the site and led the charge for its landmark status. A 73-year-old woman last year was arrested for trespassing while protesting the removal of stained glass windows and art from the shuttered church. On Friday she joined the spectating crowd at City Hall. And many have continued to pray the rosary outside the building every Friday.

But representatives with the archdiocese argued that the building is not significant enough to merit the landmark protections. It pales when compared to other neighborhood churches isn’t made by a significant architect does not add a distinctive presence in the neighborhood and had major structural issues that could require scaffolding to continue to cover its facade urban planning consultant George Kisiel said.

A landmark status would effectively block efforts to reuse the land in Pilsen which desperately needs more affordable housing Lombardo said. Any money made from the archdiocese from selling St. Adalbert would go to St. Paul’s located a mile away he added.

Needed repairs to secure the church long covered with scaffolding on its facade because of safety concerns could cost as much $8 million according to the archdiocese. The landmark designation would deter demolition but would not compel rehabilitation.

The movement to protect St. Adalbert has drawn support from Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez 25th. The Pilsen alderman gave a strident speech Friday that called for the protective status arguing the complex must be saved “not only because of the structure but because of the people … that built this structure with blood sweat and tears.”

He harshly criticized the archdiocese warning that “luxury apartments” would be built on the property if the church does not win protections. He called the arguments of archdiocese leaders “propaganda” and accused them of being like the moneychangers and merchants in the temple in Jerusalem that Jesus lambasted in the Gospel. The comparison drew eruptions of cheers and boos from the crowd.

The charged debate caused the meeting to be continually stalled due to repeated interruptions from the crowd.

“We are here for literally a hearing. That means we hear everybody” said Adam Rubin a landmarks commissioner as he tried to maintain decorum while running the meeting.

James Geoly the Chicago Archdiocese’s general counsel said later that Sigcho-Lopez had effectively blocked several proposals from developers who had pitched plans to convert the church building for other uses such as a museum and an event venue. The archdiocese was under contract with a developer when the church complex was granted preliminary landmark status in August. The landmark status would protect the church building as well as rectory convent and school.

In at least one proposal new developments on the 2-acre property would have included 40% affordable housing while preserving the main building Geoly said. He held out faith that an agreement to develop the land while preserving the structure could be reached.

“Tomorrow this could all be solved” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vY2JzYXVzdGluLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3Nhbi1tYXJjb3MtY2h1cmNoLWZlZWxpbmctdGhlLWFmdGVybWF0aC1vZi10aHVyc2RheS1uaWdodC1zdG9ybdIBZGh0dHBzOi8vY2JzYXVzdGluLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9zYW4tbWFyY29zLWNodXJjaC1mZWVsaW5nLXRoZS1hZnRlcm1hdGgtb2YtdGh1cnNkYXktbmlnaHQtc3Rvcm0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,San Marcos church feeling the aftermath of Thursday night storm,"Severe storms rolled through parts of Central Texas Thursday night bringing with them damaging winds large hail and leading to some power outages.

The City of San Marcos in Hays County was one area hit. Broken fences downed power lines and uprooted trees could all be seen driving through the city Friday. Now recovery efforts are underway as community members come together to clean up.

First a Baptist Church San Marcos saw extensive damage to its building. The church's Missions and Outreach Minister Monica Followell told CBS Austin they did not have much notice before the storm made its arrival. She said a symphonic band was practicing when it hit. When their practice was over Followell said it was discovered water was gushing into the church. “They came down the stairs and the alarms started going off the fire alarms"" said Followell. They heard the water and so they went to go check it out noticed we’ve got a waterfall where there’s not normally one.”

Followell said high winds from Thursday's storm peeled off parts of the church's metal roof.

ALSO|



Holes were created where pieces of plywood used to be. The winds also lifted water pipes from the fire suppression system.

“As that pressure gave way and it all came back down the pipes broke and just started releasing millions of gallons of water in minutes” said Followell.

After the storm Thursday and Friday dozens of volunteers members from First Baptist and other churches in the community came together to help clean up. Videos showed some of those volunteers pushing water out of the church as the fire alarms rang. Other video showed the water rushing down a staircase in the church.

Hays County Judge Ruben Becerra signed a disaster declaration Friday stating the county is facing significant threats to life health and property because of Thursday's storm.



In an X post Judge Ruben Becerra said “What I’m looking for is resources brought to our residence and the declaration will help accelerate that"" said Judge Becerra. ""I don’t want our community to have anymore work than they already do and all the help they can get for example from Red Cross from religious organizations that can come in and help willingly.

Followell said what matters most is no one that she is aware of was injured at the church. “Our biggest understanding in all of this is just a building"" she said. ""A building is a building. It’s not the church. The church is the people and so wherever we are we’ll be a church together.”

Klik untuk follow WhatsApp Channel & Google News

Ketika kamu menyukai seseorang pasti awalnya selalu indah. Tak ada sedikit pun rasanya orang yang kamu taksir itu kurang di matamu. Apalagi jika baru kenalan dan jalan berdua. Semuanya terasa sempurna. Apa pun juga ingin kamu berikan. Walau ada perbedaan itu semua tidak jadi masalah.

Namun ketika sudah dalam hubungan semua jadi terasa harus diusahakan. Inilah mengapa mempertahankan rasa cinta itu lebih sulit ketimbang saat pertama jatuh cinta. Kenapa? Yuk simak lima alasan berikut ini.

1. Karakter aslinya sudah mulai kamu ketahui ilustrasi pasangan (pixabay.com/5697702) Kamu tidak akan pernah benar-benar mengenal seseorang saat masih dalam masa pendekatan. Bahkan kehidupan setelah menikah juga bisa berbeda dibandingkan dengan pacaran. Hal ini karena saat seseorang sudah berhasil mendapat apa yang diinginkan maka dirinya akan jadi diri sendiri. Maka dari itu pasti kamu kaget dengan dirinya yang sebenarnya. Tinggal bagaimana kamu pintar-pintar mencium gelagatnya sedari awal. Bagaimana pun hubungan sudah terlanjur dijalani.

2. Ada perubahan dalam dirinya ilustrasi pasangan (pixabay.com/icsilviu) Setiap orang pasti berubah walau sedikit. Hal inilah yang membuat seseorang harus mengenal pasangannya sampai seumur hidup. Tidak bisa hanya kenal dalam satu fase kehidupan. Misalnya saja dulu doi cuek dengan penampilan. Setelah kerja dan punya uang sendiri maka jadi lebih perhatian akan penampilannya. Jadi perubahan-perubahan kecil inilah yang bisa memengaruhi kadar cinta dalam hatimu. Namun kamu harus sadar dari awal bahwa dalam hubungan pasti doi bisa berubah walau dalam hal kecil. Itu wajar dan memang akan terjadi seiring bertambahnya umur. Baca Juga: 5 Tips Menghibur Diri Setelah Putus Cinta Jangan Kelamaan Sedih!

[QUIZ] Kuis Ini Menggambarkan Sifat dari Hati yang Kamu Miliki dm-player ilustrasi pria dan wanita (pixabay.com/StockSnap) Tidak badan saja yang harus dirawat. Hubungan asmara juga harus dirawat supaya tidak jadi melempem. Kalau dibiarkan begitu saja maka tak heran hubungan jadi terasa hambar dan membosankan. Jadi kamu tetap harus menjalani kebiasaan-kebiasaan seperti dulu saat awal pacaran. Mungkin terasa sangat canggung jika melakukannya kembali. Namun hal ini justru yang akan memperbaharui hubungan kalian berdua lho.

4. Nilai penghargaan mulai berkurang ilustrasi wanita sendiri (pixabay.com/Chuotanhls) Kedekatan seseorang bisa mempertipis nilai penghargaan. Misalnya saja dulu masih sangat jaim jika bersendawa dan buang angin di depan pasangan. Namun setelah hubungan terjalin maka kamu dan doi sudah tak canggung lagi melakukan semua hal itu. Padahal tentu setiap orang harus saling menghargai apalagi sama pasangan. Jadi kamu dan dia mulai merasa nilai penghargaan bukan hal yang penting lagi. Mempertahankan hubungan pun harus dilakukan dengan usaha yang ekstra. Yuk coba mulai bangkitkan kembali perasaan sedikit sungkan sama pasangan."

Cisco relies on the hundreds of resellers in its partner program to win contracts with tens of thousands of clients globally ranging from large enterprises to small businesses. All told Cisco's partners account for 90% of the company's bookings which totalled $49.8 billion in the company's most recent fiscal year.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Insider has compiled a list of Cisco's most important partners as it aims to drive more revenue from software and subscriptions. The list which you can read in full below was drawn from Wall Street analysts conversations with Cisco executives and the company's previous public statements.

These companies handle some of Cisco's largest contracts and are leading the charge in its business transformation. Notably they span from tech titans like Amazon Web Services which has emerged as one of Cisco's most important allies down to relatively lower-profile firms like UK-based Logicalis which has been working with the firm over the better part of the last three decades.

Cisco is now leaning on its partners to spearhead the company's push beyond its core infrastructure business into newer lines of business around software and subscriptions. Earlier this year Cisco revamped its partner compensation structure to more heavily reward resellers for closing deals around its subscription-based products that generate recurring revenue.

""Partners enable Cisco to deliver the right business solutions to our customers"" Cisco chief customer and partner officer Gerri Elliot said during the company's investor day last month adding that partners are ""laser focused on continuing to transform how we go to market and continuing to put even more emphasis on driving recurring revenue.""

Analysts also say that the partner network gives Cisco an edge against a rising tide of competition including a crop of startups as well as more established firms like Microsoft Juniper Networks.

""Cisco's biggest competitive advantage is the fact that it has so many feet on the street and the fact that they own the relationship with the biggest channel partners out there"" Jim Fish director and senior research analyst at Piper Sandler told Insider.

“We’re hopeful that it will help shape the industry’s thinking about what does it mean to be a trusted provider” Cisco’s Chief Privacy Officer Harvey Jang said. “What’s challenging is there’s no consistent standard.”

The New Trust Standard provides an outline for customers of how Cisco will manage their data and maintain their privacy. Cisco will also require all of its suppliers and vendors (Jang puts this number at upwards of 3000) to adhere to this standard.

Cisco also this week signed on to the Trusted Cloud Principles initiative which includes cloud giants Amazon Microsoft and Google and pledged to advocate for data privacy and human rights protections in the cloud era.

Trust becomes increasingly important as more organizations move to hybrid work models and collect a growing amount of customer data Jang said. Meanwhile as cyberthreats increase customers want assurances that businesses will not only keep their data secure but also respect their privacy and provide transparency as to how they collect and use this data and what potential risks they face.

In addition to the New Trust Standard Cisco also released its Cisco 2021 Consumer Privacy Survey. This survey which included 2600 respondents across 12 countries also influenced the framework for building trust.

“We’re trying to put together what we’ve learned over the years from our thousands of enterprise customers — what are they demanding and what’s the new standard for trust” Jang said.

Cisco IDs 5 Elements of Trust

To this end Cisco identified five elements that it says are critical to earn and maintain customers’ trust. These elements span people processes and technology and start with a zero-trust architecture.

“One of the core tenants of our new standard is the zero-trust architecture” Jang said. “That’s not unique to Cisco. You’re seeing this trending around security overall.”

The pendulum has swung from implicitly trusting known systems and vendors to trust but verify and now has shifted to zero trust he explained. Zero trust isn’t one technology but rather a framework to ensure that only continuously verified users and devices are allowed access to corporate resources and restrict data on a least-privilege basis.

“I’m going to assume that you are a bad actor and I’m going to put in the controls to make sure that you’re not” Jang said.

In addition to zero trust the other elements of the Cisco Trust Standard include trusted supply chain data governance to ensure data is secured and access is limited transparency about what data companies collect and how they use it and certifications and regulatory compliance that includes third-party audits.

Transparency is a good place for organizations that want to implement their own trust standards Jang said. “Understanding the data you’re collecting what you’re doing with it and the risks that that dataset poses — not just looking at your intended use” he added. “Most companies are lawful and they have good motives but you have to take it one step further and think about what are some of the unintended consequences of what you’re doing?”

Jang said when he works with engineers he asks them to imagine that their worst enemy has access to the dataset. “What could they do with this data to harm you to embarrass you? You almost think like a bad actor.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9rbGFob21hbi5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wMDE1MTM5MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bill Richardson Obituary - Oklahoman,"Bill Richardson

Nichols Hills - Bill Richardson loved the ocean. He was the captain of our family safely navigating us through the waterways of life. He owned several yachts and enjoyed big game fishing which led him to several exotic ports. Bill sailed his final voyage on Sunday September 26th 2021. He was 92. Bill Richardson was born on May 10th 1929 in Thomas Oklahoma to Unice and George Richardson. He was the second of eight siblings. Bill went to school in Clinton Oklahoma where he excelled at track and today the Clinton High School Track bears his name. After graduating high school Bill joined the army at 17 years old. When his military duties were completed he returned to Oklahoma and graduated business school with an emphasis in accounting. But he quickly found out that his true passion was the car business. He often told the ""tale"" of how he started with one ""slick"" car and when it sold he was able to get two more cars. He kept this up until he owned car dealerships from Oklahoma to Texas. He was American Motors' number 2 dealer in the nation. He specialized in the Nash Rambler. His love for cars continued all his life and he was very proud of his classic car collection which topped out at 205! In the 60's Bill discovered another love: banking. After buying his first bank he began opening additional locations which paved the way for what we know today as First Enterprise Bank. Bill was extremely proud of the fact that his bank was one of the few ""family owned banks"" where his customers could come in and talk to him in person. Until a few months ago he never missed a day of work. During the past week while battling pneumonia he would constantly mention that he needed to hurry up and get back to the office and ""make some money"". Bill is survived by his wife of 32 years Barbara Richardson Children: David Richardson (deceased) Dennis Richardson and wife Allison daughter Ann Harris and husband Bill step-daughter Gina Cisco Siblings: Nadine Seeds Jerri Romig Robert Richardson and wife Pat Mary Gertrude Barber Gene Richardson Carol Vaghn and husband Allen James Richardson Grandchildren: Travis Harris (deceased) Nichole Harris Mason Daniels Harris Kailey Spencer Tristan Hutchison and Laila Cisco. Great grandchild Mason Spencer plus numerous nieces and nephews. There was never a dull moment with Bill. His knowledge was vast and his world was gold. He enjoyed traveling all over the world jewelry shopping in the Bahamas which always included a stop to eat conch fritters and would often sing you a tune even if you didn't ask for one! He loved spending time in Fort Lauderdale Florida where he owns a beautiful marine property. He truly enjoyed all that life had to offer he always stopped to smell the roses and offered a smile to everyone. He will be missed. Viewing will be held Sunday October 3 from 8-5pm and Monday October 4 2021 from 8-6pm with the family receiving guests at the funeral home from 4-6pm.

Citigroup reported that chief equity strategist Tobias Levkovich died on Friday a month after being hit by a car while crossing a street in Long Island NY.

Levkovich was perhaps the world's most well-known equity strategist and had been in his role at Citi since 2001.

The same day he was hit by the car Levokvich published his last equity note. It ended up being prescient as he retained a bearish stance on equities despite the strong start to the year. He maintained a 4000 target on the S&P 500.

The index closed at 4524 on the day it was published and fell to 4307 at month end. It would need to fall just below the May lows to meet his target.

In his final note he wrote about ""parallels between current conditions and those of 1999.""

""Caution that proves to be wrong can cost one a career"" Levkovich told clients in the note. ""Nevertheless we feel compelled to stand by our analytical process.""

The S&P 500 roared 49 points higher on Friday but given the worries about bottlenecks inflation China energy and congress. Levkovich may have the last laugh.

He was 67.

An alumni of IIM-Ahmedabad Relan was serving as partner at homegrown private equity fund Xponentia Capital which he co-founded in 2018.

Prior to founding Xponentia Relan was the founder and managing partner at CX Partners which raised a $550 million India Fund in 2009. Before CX Partners he founded the India business of Citigroup Venture Capital International (CVCI) in 1996.

Relan was also a member of the CVCI team which raised two global emerging market funds --$1.5 billion in 2005 and $4.3 billion in 2007. He was also on the board of HT Media which is the parent of Mosaic Media and publishes VCCircle and Mint.

PE executives across the business and political spectrum are mourning his loss.

“Ajay was a legend. A fine human being who lived life on his own terms. A man who took the road less travelling. A big brother of sorts who never threw his weight around. I will miss Ajay. But never forget him. And can’t thank him enough"" said Ashish Dhawan founder at ChrysCapital in a LinkedIn obituary.

“Today is a black day in the history of Indian private equity and venture capital industry in India The untimely death of Ajay Relan one of the industry pioneers has left a deep void"" Sumeet Narang co-founder of Samara Capital said in a Linkedin post on Friday evening.

“Ajay started the VC business in mid 90s and private equity in late 90s which set the foundation for the industry in India. Many of his proteges are leaders in the investment business today"" Narang’s post added.

Relan was instrumental in building a team of operating partners to help his portfolio with domain expertise during CX days. Relan also had onboarded top managers like Jayanta Basu and Vivek Chhachi to help him build one of the leading mid-market PE funds in India.

Over his investment career he had led and had been involved in numerous deals with an aggregate invested capital in excess of $2 billion.

In 2015 Relan had decided to retire from the industry and passed on the day-to-day operations to his cofounder Jayanta Basu. “I don’t want to hold up a position for so many years when there is enough talent in the firm"" Relan had told VCCircle in 2015.

But Relan returned to the PE business in 2018 with two other industry veterans founding Xponentia Capital.

Harsh Singhal managing director of CDPQIndia said ""A pioneer of our industry has left us"" adding that Relan inspired many talented people to join the industry.

JM Trivedi the former India head of private equity firm Actis said Relan had a keen eye for a multibagger who was willing to take risks for the same. ""I remember his bets on Lupin and Suzlon which turned out to be a huge success for CVC"".

He was a generous person and his generosity extended beyond his lifespan as Relan had volunteered to donate his body and organs said Rajeev Kalra managing director and head of India at the Rohatyn Group.

The secret documents expose offshore dealings of the King of Jordan the presidents of Ukraine Kenya and Ecuador the prime minister of the Czech Republic and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The files also detail financial activities of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “unofficial minister of propaganda” and more than 130 billionaires from Russia the United States Turkey and other nations.

The leaked records reveal that many of the power players who could help bring an end to the offshore system instead benefit from it – stashing assets in covert companies and trusts while their governments do little to slow a global stream of illicit money that enriches criminals and impoverishes nations.

Among the hidden treasures revealed in the documents:

A $22 million chateau in the French Riviera – replete with a cinema and two swimming pools – purchased through offshore companies by the Czech Republic’s populist prime minister a billionaire who has railed against the corruption of economic and political elites.

More than $13 million tucked in a secrecy-shaded trust in the Great Plains of the United States by a scion of one of Guatemala’s most powerful families a dynasty that controls a soap and lipsticks conglomerate that’s been accused of harming workers and the earth.

Three beachfront mansions in Malibu purchased through three offshore companies for $68 million by the King of Jordan in the years after Jordanians filled the streets during Arab Spring to protest joblessness and corruption.

The secret records are known as the Pandora Papers.

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists obtained the trove of more than 11.9 million confidential files and led a team of more than 600 journalists from 150 news outlets that spent two years sifting through them tracking down hard-to-find sources and digging into court records and other public documents from dozens of countries.

The leaked records come from 14 offshore services firms from around the world that set up shell companies and other offshore nooks for clients often seeking to keep their financial activities in the shadows. The records include information about the dealings of nearly three times as many current and former country leaders as any previous leak of documents from offshore havens.

In an era of widening authoritarianism and inequality the Pandora Papers investigation provides an unequaled perspective on how money and power operate in the 21st century – and how the rule of law has been bent and broken around the world by a system of financial secrecy enabled by the U.S. and other wealthy nations.

The findings by ICIJ and its media partners spotlight how deeply secretive finance has infiltrated global politics – and offer insights into why governments and global organizations have made little headway in ending offshore financial abuses.

An ICIJ analysis of the secret documents identified 956 companies in offshore havens tied to 336 high-level politicians and public officials including country leaders cabinet ministers ambassadors and others. More than two-thirds of those companies were set up in the British Virgin Islands a jurisdiction long known as a key cog in the offshore system.

At least $11.3 trillion is held “offshore” according to a 2020 study by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Because of the complexity and secrecy of the offshore system it’s not possible to know how much of that wealth is tied to tax evasion and other crimes and how much of it involves funds that come from legitimate sources and have been reported to proper authorities.

Every corner of the world

The Pandora Papers investigation unmasks the covert owners of offshore companies incognito bank accounts private jets yachts mansions even artworks by Picasso Banksy and other masters – providing more information than what’s usually available to law enforcement agencies and cash-strapped governments.

People linked by the secret documents to offshore assets include India’s cricket superstar Sachin Tendulkar pop music diva Shakira supermodel Claudia Schiffer and an Italian mobster known as “Lell the Fat One.”

The mobster Raffaele Amato has been tied to at least a dozen killings. The documents provide details about a shell company registered in the United Kingdom that Amato used to buy land in Spain shortly before fleeing there from Italy to set up his own crime gang. Amato whose history helped inspire the highly praised movie “Gomorrah” is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

Amato’s attorney did not respond to ICIJ’s request for comment.

Tendulkar’s attorney said the cricket player’s investment is legitimate and has been declared to tax authorities. Shakira’s attorney said the singer declared her companies which the attorney said do not provide tax advantages. Schiffer’s representatives said the supermodel correctly pays her taxes in the U.K. where she lives.

In most countries it’s not illegal to have assets offshore or to use shell companies to do business across national borders. Businesspeople who operate internationally say they need offshore companies to conduct their financial affairs.

But these affairs often amount to shifting profits from high-tax countries where they are earned to companies that exist only on paper in low-tax jurisdictions. Using offshore shelters is especially controversial for political figures because they can be used to keep politically unpopular or even illicit activities from public view.

In popular imagination the offshore system is often seen as a far-flung cluster of palm-shaded islands. The Pandora Papers show that the offshore money machine operates in every corner of the planet including the world’s largest democracies. The key players in the system include elite institutions – multinational banks law firms and accounting practices – headquartered in the U.S. and Europe.

A document in the Pandora Papers shows that banks around the world helped their customers set up at least 3926 offshore companies with the assistance of Alemán Cordero Galindo & Lee a Panamanian law firm led by a former ambassador to the U.S. The document shows that the firm – also known as Alcogal – set up at least 312 companies in the British Virgin Islands for clients of the American financial services giant Morgan Stanley.

A Morgan Stanley spokesperson said: “We do not create offshore companies. . . . This process is independent of the firm and at the discretion and direction of the client.”

The Pandora Papers investigation also highlights how Baker McKenzie the largest law firm in the U.S. helped create the modern offshore system and continues to be a mainstay of this shadow economy.

Baker McKenzie and its global affiliates have used their lobbying and legislation-drafting know-how to shape financial laws around the world. They have also profited from work done for people tied to fraud and corruption reporting by ICIJ has found.

The people that the firm has done work for includes Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky who U.S. authorities allege laundered $5.5 billion through a tangle of shell companies purchasing factories and commercial properties across the U.S. heartland.

Baker McKenzie also did work for Jho Low a now-fugitive financier accused by authorities in multiple countries of masterminding the embezzlement of more than $4.5 billion from a Malaysian economic development fund known as 1MDB. ICIJ’s reporting found that Low relied on Baker McKenzie and its affiliates to help him and his associates build a web of companies in Malaysia and Hong Kong. U.S. authorities allege they used some of those companies to shift money looted from 1MDB.

A spokesperson for Baker McKenzie said the firm seeks to provide the best advice to its clients and strives “to ensure that our clients adhere to both the law and best practice.”

The spokesperson didn’t directly address many questions about Baker McKenzie’s role in the offshore economy citing client confidentiality and legal privilege. But he said the firm performs strict background checks on all potential clients.

‘You know who’

The Pandora Papers investigation is larger and more global than even ICIJ’s landmark Panama Papers investigation which rocked the world in 2016 spawning police raids and new laws in dozens of countries and the fall of prime ministers in Iceland and Pakistan.

The Panama Papers came from the files of a single offshore services provider: the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. The Pandora Papers shine a light on a far wider cross-section of the lawyers and middlemen who are at the heart of the offshore industry.

The Pandora Papers provide more than twice as much information about the ownership of offshore companies. In all the new leak of documents reveals the real owners of more than 29000 offshore companies. The owners come from more than 200 countries and territories with the largest contingents from Russia the U.K. Argentina and China.

The 150 news outlets that joined the investigative partnership include The Washington Post the BBC The Guardian Radio France Oštro Croatia the Indian Express Zimbabwe’s The Standard Morocco’s Le Desk and Ecuador’s Diario El Universo.

A global team was needed because the 14 offshore providers that are the sources of the leaked documents are headquartered around the globe from the Caribbean to the Persian Gulf to the South China Sea.

Three of the providers are owned by former senior government officials: a former government minister and presidential adviser in Panama and a former attorney general of Belize who controls two providers.

For a few hundred or a few thousand dollars offshore providers can help clients set up a company whose real owners remain hidden. Or for perhaps $2000 to $25000 they can set up a trust that in some instances allows its beneficiaries to control their money while embracing the legal fiction that they don’t control it – a bit of paper-shuffling creativity that helps shield assets from creditors law enforcement and ex-spouses.

Offshore operatives don’t work in isolation. They partner with other secrecy providers around the globe to create interlocking layers of companies and trusts. The more complex the arrangements the higher the fees – and the more secrecy and protection clients can expect.

The Pandora Papers show that an English accountant in Switzerland worked with lawyers in the British Virgin Islands to help Jordan’s monarch King Abdullah II secretly purchase 14 luxury homes worth more than $106 million in the U.S. and the U.K. The advisers helped him set up at least 36 shell companies from 1995 to 2017.

In 2017 the king bought a $23 million property overlooking a California surfing beach through a company in the BVI. The king paid extra to have another BVI company owned by his Swiss wealth managers act as the “nominee” director for the BVI company that bought the property.

In the offshore world nominee directors are people or companies paid to front for whoever is really behind a company. Application forms sent to clients by Alcogal the law firm working on the king’s behalf say that the use of nominee directors helps “preserve privacy by avoiding the identity of the ultimate principal . . . being publicly accessible.”

In emails offshore advisers used a code name for the king: “You know who.”

U.K. attorneys for the king said that he is not required to pay taxes under Jordanian law and that he has security and privacy reasons to hold property through offshore companies. They said the king has never misused public funds.

The attorneys also said that most of the companies and properties identified by ICIJ have no connection to the king or no longer exist but declined to provide details.

Experts say that as ruler of one of the Middle East’s poorest and most aid-dependent countries the king has reasons to avoid flaunting his wealth.

“If the Jordanian monarch were to display his wealth more publicly it wouldn’t only antagonize his people it would piss off Western donors who have given him money” Annelle Sheline an expert on political authority in the Middle East told ICIJ.

In neighboring Lebanon where similar questions about wealth and poverty have been playing out the Pandora Papers show top political and financial figures have also embraced offshore havens.

They include the current prime minister Najib Mikati and his predecessor Hassan Diab as well as Riad Salameh the governor of Lebanon’s central bank who is under investigation in France for alleged money laundering.

Marwan Kheireddine Lebanon’s former minister of state and the chairman of Al Mawarid Bank also appears in the secret files. In 2019 he scolded former parliamentary colleagues for inaction amid a dire economic crisis. Half the population was living in poverty struggling to find food as grocers and bakeries closed.

“There is tax evasion and the government needs to address that” Kheireddine said.

That same year the Pandora Papers reveal Kheireddine signed documents as owner of a BVI company that owns a $2 million yacht.

Al Mawarid Bank was one of many in the country that restricted customers’ U.S. dollar withdrawals to stem economic panic.

Wafaa Abou Hamdan a 57-year-old widow is among the regular Lebanese who remain angry at their country’s elites. Because of runaway inflation her life savings plummeted from the equivalent of $60000 to less than $5000 she told Daraj an ICIJ media partner.

“All my life’s efforts went in vain. I have been working continuously for the past three decades” she said. “We are still struggling on a daily basis to maintain our living” while “the politicians and the bankers” have “all transferred and invested their money abroad.”

Kheireddine and Diab did not respond to requests for comment. In a written response Salameh said he declares his assets and has complied with reporting obligations under Lebanese law. Mikati’s son Maher said it is common for people in Lebanon to use offshore companies “due to the easy process of incorporation” rather than a desire to evade taxes.

‘Coalition of the corrupt’

Imran Khan was elated when ICIJ’s Panama Papers investigation came out in April 2016.

“The leaks are God-sent” the Pakistani politician and former cricket superstar said.

The Panama Papers revealed that the children of Pakistan’s prime minister at the time Nawaz Sharif had ties to offshore companies. This gave Khan an opening to hammer Sharif his political rival on what Khan described as the “coalition of the corrupt” ravaging Pakistan.

“It is disgusting the way money is plundered in the developing world from people who are already deprived of basic amenities: health education justice and employment” Khan told ICIJ’s partner The Guardian in 2016. “This money is put into offshore accounts or even western countries western banks. The poor get poorer. Poor countries get poorer and rich countries get richer. Offshore accounts protect these crooks.”

Ultimately Pakistan’s top court removed Sharif from office as a result of an inquiry sparked by the Panama Papers. Khan swept in to replace him in the next national election.

ICIJ’s latest investigation the Pandora Papers brings renewed attention to the use of offshore companies by Pakistani political players. This time the offshore holdings of people close to Khan are being disclosed including his finance minister and a top financial backer.

The documents also show that Khan’s water resources minister Chaudhry Moonis Elahi contacted Asiaciti an Singapore-based offshore services provider in 2016 about setting up a trust to invest the profits from a family land deal that had been financed by what the lender later claimed was an illegal loan. The bank told Pakistani authorities that the loan had been approved due to the influence of Elahi’s father a former deputy prime minister.

Asiaciti records say that Elahi backed off from putting money into a trust in Singapore after the provider told him it would report the details to Pakistani tax authorities.

Elahi did not respond to ICIJ’s requests for comment. Hours before the release of Pandora Papers stories a family spokesman told ICIJ media partners that “misleading interpretations and data have been circulated in files for nefarious reasons.” The spokesman added that the family’s assets “are declared as per applicable law.”

Also today a spokesperson for Khan told a press conference that if any of his ministers or advisors had offshore companies “they will have to be held accountable.”

Other political figures have also spoken out against the offshore system while surrounded by appointees and other supporters who have assets stowed offshore. Some who have spoken out have used the system themselves.

“Every public servant’s assets must be declared publicly so that people can question and ask – what is legitimate?” Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta told the BBC in 2018. “If you can’t explain yourself including myself then I have a case to answer.”

The leaked records listed Kenyatta and his mother as beneficiaries of a secretive foundation in Panama. Other family members including his brother and two sisters own five offshore companies with assets worth more than $30 million the records show.

Kenyatta and his family did not reply to requests for comment.

Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis one of his country’s richest men rose to power promising to crack down on tax evasion and corruption. In 2011 as he became more involved in politics Babis told voters that he wanted to create a country “where entrepreneurs will do business and will be happy to pay taxes.”

The leaked records show that in 2009 Babis injected $22 million into a string of shell companies to buy a sprawling property known as Chateau Bigaud in a hilltop village in Mougins France near Cannes.

Babis has not disclosed the shell companies and the chateau in the asset declarations he’s required to file as a public official according to documents obtained by ICIJ’s Czech partner Investigace.cz. In 2018 a real estate conglomerate indirectly owned by Babis quietly bought the Monaco company that owned the chateau.

Babis didn’t respond to requests for comment.

A spokesman for the conglomerate told ICIJ that it complies with the law. He didn’t respond to questions about the acquisition of the chateau.

“Like any other business entity we have the right to protect our trade secrets” the spokesman wrote.

‘A haven of scams’

The secret files provide a layer of behind-the-curtain context to public pronouncements this year about wealth and offshore refuges — as governments around the world struggle with revenue crunches a pandemic climate change and public distrust.

In February a commentary from the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change urged policymakers to seek among other measures higher taxes on land and homes. Blair the institute’s founder and executive chairman talked about how the rich and well-connected shirk paying their share of taxes as far back as 1994 when he campaigned to become the leader of the U.K.’s Labour Party.

“For those who can employ the right accountants the tax system is a haven of scams perks … and profits” he said during a speech in England’s West Midlands. “We should not make our tax rules a playground for …. tax abusers who pay little or nothing while others pay more than their share.”

The Pandora Papers show that in 2017 Blair and his wife Cherie became the owners of a $8.8 million Victorian building by acquiring the British Virgin Islands company that held the property. The London building now hosts Cherie Blair’s law firm.

The records indicate that Cherie Blair and her husband who served as a diplomat in the Middle East after stepping down as prime minister in 2007 bought the offshore company that owned the building from the family of Bahrain’s industry and tourism minister Zayed bin Rashid al-Zayani.

By purchasing the company shares instead of the building the Blairs benefited from a legal arrangement that saved them from having to pay more than $400000 in property taxes.

The Blairs and the al-Zayanis said they didn’t initially know about each other’s involvement in the deal.

Cherie Blair said that her husband was not involved in the transaction and that its purpose was “bringing the company and the building back into the U.K. tax and regulatory regime.”

She also said that she “did not want to be the owner of a BVI company” and that the “seller for their own purposes only wanted to sell the company.” The company is now closed.

Through their lawyer the al-Zayanis said their companies “have complied with all U.K. laws past and present.”

“These are loopholes that are available to wealthy people but not available to others” Robert Palmer executive director of Tax Justice UK told The Guardian. “Politicians need to fix the tax system so that everyone pays their fair share.”

In June Brazil’s economics minister Paulo Guedes proposed a tax reform package that included a 30% tax on profits earned through offshore entities. Experts estimate that Brazil’s richest people hold almost $200 billion in untaxed funds outside the country.

“You cannot be ashamed of being rich” Guedes said. “You have to be ashamed of not paying taxes.”

After bankers and business leaders objected to tax hikes in the legislation Guedes a millionaire former banker agreed to remove the proposed tax on offshore profits. Negotiations over the legislation are continuing.

The Pandora Papers reveal that Guedes created Dreadnoughts International Group in 2014 in the British Virgin Islands.

In response to questions from an ICIJ partner in Brazil Revista Piauí a spokesperson for Guedes said the minister has disclosed the company to Brazilian authorities. The spokesperson did not answer a question about the removal of the offshore tax from the legislation.

‘Pandora’s box’

In December 2018 the Bahamas enacted legislation requiring companies and certain trusts to declare their real owners to a government registry. The island nation was under pressure from larger countries including the U.S. to do more to block tax dodgers and criminals from the financial system.

Some Bahamian politicians opposed the move. They complained the register would discourage Latin American clients from doing business in the Caribbean. “The winners of these new double standards are the U.S. states of Delaware Alaska and South Dakota” one local attorney said.

Months later a confidential document indicated that the family of the Dominican Republic’s former Vice President Carlos Morales Troncoso had abandoned the Bahamas as a go-to sanctuary for their wealth.

For their new refuge they chose a place 1600 miles away: Sioux Falls South Dakota.

The family set up South Dakota trusts leaked records show to lay away various assets including shares they’d held in a Dominican sugar company. The family did not respond to questions about the assets moved from the Bahamas to South Dakota.

The Pandora Papers provide details about tens of millions of dollars moved from offshore havens in the Caribbean and Europe into South Dakota a sparsely populated American state that has become a major destination for foreign assets.

Over the past decade South Dakota Nevada and more than a dozen other U.S. states have transformed themselves into leaders in the business of peddling financial secrecy. Meanwhile most of the policy and law enforcement efforts of the world’s most powerful nations have stayed focused on “traditional” offshore havens such as the Bahamas the Caymans and other island paradises.

The U.S. is one of the biggest players in the offshore world. It is also the country best situated to bring an end to offshore financial abuses thanks to the outsize role it plays in the international banking system. Because of the U.S. dollar’s status as the de facto global currency most international transactions flow in and out of New York-based banking operations.

U.S. authorities have taken action over the past two decades to force banks in Switzerland and other countries to turn over information about Americans with overseas accounts.

But the U.S. is more interested in forcing other countries to share information about Americans banking offshore than in sharing information about money moving through U.S. bank accounts companies and trusts.

The U.S. has refused to join a 2014 agreement supported by more than 100 jurisdictions including the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg that would require American financial institutions to share information they have about foreigners’ assets.

Year after year in South Dakota state lawmakers have approved legislation drafted by trust industry insiders providing more and more protections and other benefits for trust customers in the U.S. and abroad. Customer assets in South Dakota trusts have more than quadrupled over the past decade to $360 billion.

“As a citizen I’m so sad that my state was the state that opened Pandora’s box” Susan Wismer a former lawmaker told ICIJ.

By 2020 17 of the world’s 20 least-restrictive jurisdictions for trusts were American states according to a study by Israeli academic Adam Hofri-Winogradow. In many cases he said U.S. laws have made it more difficult for creditors to put their hands on what they are owed including child support payments from absent parents.

Using documents from the Pandora Papers ICIJ and The Washington Post identified nearly 30 U.S.-based trusts linked to foreigners personally accused of misconduct or whose companies were accused of wrongdoing.

Among them is Federico Kong Vielman whose family is one of Guatemala’s economic powerhouses.

In 2016 Kong Vielman moved $13.5 million into a trust in Sioux Falls. Some of the money came from his family’s company which makes floor waxes and other products.

Guatemalan media reported for decades on the family’s ties to politics. In the 1970s the family was identified as a key ally of Gen. Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio the former Guatemalan dictator known as the “Jackal of Zacapa.” In 2016 the family’s luxury hotel in Guatemala City made a gift of 100 free nights to then-President Jimmy Morales. Guatemalan media outlets reported that a possible payment for “political favors” was suspected.

In 2014 U.S. labor officials filed a complaint against Guatemala’s government that included allegations that the family’s palm oil company underpaid workers and exposed them to toxic chemicals. Company records show Kong Vielman was previously the company’s treasurer.

A year later U.S. environmental authorities providing technical assistance to Guatemala found that the company released pollutants into the Pasion River. The family company Nacional Agro Industrial SA known as Naisa was not charged.

Naisa told ICIJ that it followed the law and did not pollute the river. The labor complaint was resolved by an arbitration panel the company said.

Kong Vielman declined to respond to questions about the South Dakota trust.

Another wealthy Latin American who set up trusts in South Dakota is Guillermo Lasso a banker who was elected as Ecuador’s president in April. Leaked records show that Lasso moved assets into two trusts in South Dakota in December 2017 three months after Ecuador’s parliament passed a law prohibiting public officials from holding assets in tax havens. The records show that Lasso moved two offshore companies to the South Dakota trusts from two secretive foundations in Panama.

Lasso said that his past use of offshore entities was “legal and legitimate.” Lasso said he complies with Ecuadorian law.

Trusts set up in South Dakota and many other U.S. states remain cloaked in secrecy despite enactment this year of the federal Corporate Transparency Act which makes it harder for owners of certain types of companies to hide their identities.

The law is not expected to apply to trusts popular with non-U.S. citizens. Another glaring exemption financial crime experts say is that many lawyers who set up trusts and shell companies have no obligations to examine the sources of their clients’ wealth.

“Clearly the U.S. is a big big loophole in the world” said Yehuda Shaffer former head of the Israeli financial intelligence unit. “The U.S. is criticizing all the rest of the world but in their own backyard this is a very very serious issue.”

‘Extraordinary expenses’

Billionaire Erman Ilicak’s construction empire had a big year in 2014.

The Turkish mogul’s company Rönesans Holding finished building a 1150-room presidential palace for his country’s pugnacious leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan amid media rumblings about cost overruns and corruption and a court order attempting to stop the project.

Another notable event involving the Ilicak family took place in 2014 this time out of the public glare. The corporate titan’s 74-year-old mother Ayse Ilicak became the owner of two offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands according to the Pandora Papers.

Both companies were fronted by nominee directors and nominee shareholders. One of the companies Covar Trading Ltd. held assets from the family’s construction conglomerate the records say. During its first full year in operation Covar Trading earned $105.5 million in income from dividends according to confidential financial statements. The money was stashed in a Swiss account.

It didn’t stay long.

That same year the statements show the company paid almost the entire $105.5 million as a “donation” listed under “extraordinary expenses.” The statements do not describe who or what received the money.

Illiack did not reply to questions for this story.

Ilicak and the other billionaires in the Pandora Papers come from 45 countries with the largest number from Russia (52) Brazil (15) the U.K. (13) and Israel (10).

The American billionaires mentioned in the secret documents include two tech moguls Robert F. Smith and Robert T. Brockman whose trusts have been the targets of investigations by U.S. authorities. Both were clients of CILTrust an offshore provider in Belize operated by Glenn Godfrey a former attorney general of Belize.

Sign up for a special guided tour of the Pandora Papers investigation delivered straight to your inbox.

Smith agreed last year to pay U.S. authorities $139 million to settle a tax probe and is cooperating with prosecutors. A U.S. grand jury indicted Brockman Smith’s mentor and financial backer in what prosecutors called the biggest tax fraud in U.S. history.

Smith declined to comment. Brockman has pleaded not guilty.

Neither CILTrust nor Godfrey have been accused of wrongdoing. Godfrey did not respond to requests for comment.

A law firm in Cyprus Nicos Chr. Anastasiades and Partners appears in the Pandora Papers as a key offshore go-between for wealthy Russians. The firm retains the name of its founder Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades and the president’s two daughters are partners there.

The records show that in 2015 a compliance manager at the Panama law firm Alcogal found that the Cypriot law firm helped a Russian billionaire and former senator Leonid Lebedev conceal ownership of four companies by listing law firm employees as owners of Lebedev’s entities.

Lebedev – an oil tycoon and movie producer with Hollywood connections – fled Russia in 2016 after authorities accused him of embezzling $220 million from an energy company. Lebedev did not respond to requests for comment. The status of the Russian case is unclear.

The Cypriot law firm also prepared reference letters for Russian steel magnate Alexander Abramov including one drafted days after the U.S. added the billionaire’s name to the list of oligarchs close to President Putin. Abramov didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Theophanis Philippou the law firm’s managing director told the BBC an ICIJ partner that it has never misled authorities or concealed the identity of a company owner. He declined to comment on clients citing attorney-client confidentiality.

Another Russian in the Pandora Papers who has ties to Putin is Konstantin Ernst a television executive and Oscar-nominated producer. He has been called Putin’s top image-maker a creative talent who sold the nation on the idea that the president is “Russia’s strong-willed savior.”

The Pandora Papers reveal that Ernst was given a chance to participate in a lucrative opportunity soon after producing the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics at Sochi creating a spectacle that boosted Putin’s reputation inside and outside the country.

Ernst became a silent partner hidden behind layers of offshore companies in a state-funded privatization contract – a deal to buy dozens of movie theaters and other property from the city of Moscow.

The leaked records show that by 2019 the value of Ernst’s personal stake in the property holdings topped $140 million.

Ernst told ICIJ that he has “never made a secret” of his involvement in the privatization deal and that the deal was not compensation for his work during the 2014 Olympics.

“I haven’t committed any illegal actions” he said. “Nor am I committing any now or about to. This is how my parents raised me.”

‘Our way of life’

As a human rights and anti-poverty activist Mae Buenaventura joined the fight to secure the return of billions of dollars the late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos his family and cronies concealed in Swiss accounts and other hard-to-trace locations.

Many in her home country Buenaventura said “know that the wealthy have ways and means to accumulate riches and also hide them in a way that ordinary people cannot get their hands on.”

The Marcos scandal also educated the world encouraging stepped-up efforts to discover illicit money and punish the people who hide it.

Over the last 20 years political leaders have vowed to “eradicate” tax havens. They’ve called shell companies and money laundering “threats to our security our democracy and our way of life.” They’ve passed new laws and inked international agreements.

But the offshore system is nothing if not adaptable and cross-border financial crime and tax dodging continue to thrive.

When an offshore provider or jurisdiction is exposed by a leak or comes under pressure from authorities others use its misfortune as a marketing opportunity snapping up clients fleeing for safer havens.

An ICIJ analysis identified hundreds of offshore companies that ended relationships with the scandal-tarred law firm Mossack Fonseca after the release of the Panama Papers investigation. Other providers took over as the companies’ offshore agents.

One of those companies was controlled by an offshore trust whose beneficiaries included the wife of Jacob Rees-Mogg a member of the British Conservative Party and current leader of the House of Commons.

The Pandora Papers indicate that a holding company and a trust benefiting his spouse Helena de Chair owned “pictures and paintings” worth $3.5 million.

Another company that moved away from Mossack Fonseca was a BVI entity controlled by the widow and two sons of Indian underworld figure Iqbal Memon. Memon has been identified in news reports as a major drug dealer with links to terrorists. His widow and sons are accused of laundering drug money and have been wanted since 2019 by authorities in New Delhi.

In the Philippines money being moved around in the shadows continues to be a problem despite the attention given to Marcos’ offshore loot. In recent years the U.S. has labeled the Philippines as a “major money laundering jurisdiction.”

Philippine political figures in the Pandora Papers include Juan Andres Donato Bautista. He served from 2010 to 2015 as the chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government – the panel established to track down Marcos’ billions.

A month after he was appointed to lead the commission Bautista created a shell company in the British Virgin Island that held a bank account in Singapore secret records show.

Bautista was later tapped to head the country’s election agency but lawmakers impeached him in 2017 after his wife claimed he’d hoarded millions of dollars in undeclared domestic and foreign accounts.

In a phone call and emails to ICIJ Bautista said he created his BVI company on the advice of bankers. The bank account was opened before he joined the government he said adding that it never received significant deposits and that he disclosed his interests to authorities. He denied wrongdoing and said there are no formal charges against him.

Despite failures by the Philippines and other nations to curb the flow of covert money Buenaventura and other reform advocates say there are reasons for hope.

Street protesters helped topple top leaders in Iceland and Pakistan after the Panama Papers. The Philippines has joined dozens of countries that now require companies to disclose their real owners. Philippine authorities have recovered roughly $4 billion stolen by Marcos and his circle using it to buy land for landless farmers and to compensate families of people targeted for murder or “enforced disappearance” by the Marcos regime.

Many obstacles remain. Big banks law firms and other powerful groups often oppose stronger transparency rules and tougher enforcement against offshore abuses. And in the Philippines and many other countries anti-corruption activists endure legal threats arrests and violence.

Last month police fired water cannons at protesters who marked the 49th anniversary of Marcos’ declaration of martial law by drawing attention to similarities with current President Rodrigo Duterte’s rule.

Buenaventura said she and other grass-roots activists will keep working to expose wealth that’s “deeply hidden.”

“Our slogan is: The truth will come out.”

It was Thursday October 2 2008. The Philadelphia Phillies were set to take on the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 2 of the National League Division Series at Citizens Bank Park.

After jumping to a 1-0 series lead the night before the Phillies were eager to keep the momentum rolling and Shane Victorino led the way.

Philadelphia was facing Milwaukee ace CC Sabathia who was acquired at the trade deadline by the Brewers. He was excellent for them in the second-half propelling them to the NL Wild Card berth.

However none of that mattered to Victorino when he launched a grand slam to left field off of Sabathia in the second inning to put the Phils up 5-1.

The crowd at Citizens Bank Park absolutely erupted. It was truly a magical moment.

The grand slam and a Pedro Feliz RBI-double would be all the Phillies would need to win Game 2. The offense was backed by a strong performance from Brett Myers who went seven innings and allowed just two runs on two hits.

Ryan Madson and J.C. Romero pitched a clean eighth and Brad Lidge remained perfect and picked up his second save of the postseason. Phillies fans were happy. It was nice.

But an effort among locals to kneecap the program before it starts is gaining momentum.

Barstow’s City Council unanimously voted a few months ago to mandate annual inspections for all properties containing at least one “rental dwelling unit” though it granted hotels motels healthcare facilities and student dorms immunity from the mandate.

The program is set to take effect Jan. 1 2022. Yet most tenants are likely still in the dark about it. Some local landlords whose properties are owned by a management firm or agency said even they had no idea the ordinance existed when recently asked about it.

Word has spread in the past month though and some locals have begun vocally opposing the program in City Hall and during public forums.

“As my mother used to say I’m so mad I could chew on some tacks” said Ira Gwin a longtime Barstow resident and landlord who has led the public opposition.

Their argument is one various attorneys academics and civil-liberties groups have made in the U.S. for decades: Mandatory inspection programs violate the Constitution’s protection “against unreasonable searches and seizures” guaranteed to everyone — including renters.

“What you are observing over there in San Bernardino County is emblematic of increasingly invasive inspection programs that provide little to no tenant recourse” said Rob Peccola an attorney with the Institute for Justice which litigates and lobbies against policies it views as government overreach.

'Straight for the financial jugular'

Barstow’s official reason for a mandate on rental inspections is to raise property values public health and “environmental justice” and “create an aesthetically pleasing community by cleaning up neighborhoods and enforcing municipal codes” according to city documents.

Other municipalities in the U.S. including Victorville and Palmdale have implemented their own rental-inspection programs in prior years. Each differs in various ways.

Barstow’s iteration has been spearheaded by Chris Heldreth who is both the city’s Building and Safety Department director and its fire marshal. The program is something Heldreth has “actually been working on for four years if not longer” he said at a June 21 City Council meeting.

Heldreth has downplayed the idea that the program’s enforcement mechanisms could be abused.

“My goal is not to fine you. My goal is not to chase after you and make you comply. I would love it for everybody to comply” he said at the June 21 meeting. “Sometimes you have to do those things but the goal behind it all is to make a better livable situation for everybody.”

What does the ordinance say?

Peccola who has won courtroom challenges against similar programs in other U.S. cities and counties said the most important aspect of Barstow’s ordinance is something it doesn’t acknowledge.

“What stood out to me by way of its absence was any sort of warrant provision about what to do when somebody doesn’t grant entry” he said.

In other words Barstow’s new guidelines for rental inspections do not reference search warrants or the Fourth Amendment in general.

“At the very least” Peccola continued “there should be a requirement that when a tenant doesn’t voluntarily consent to a search of the inside of their home that you have to go get a search warrant based on probable cause.”

Barstow’s ordinance instead states that if any owner or tenant “refuses to allow access to conduct the exterior or interior inspection City personnel and the City Attorney may use all legal remedies to ensure that an inspection is conducted.”

Most rental-inspection mandates in the U.S. require an “administrative warrant” to be granted by a judge if a tenant refuses entry.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1967 that conducting health and safety inspections without such a warrant and without an owner or occupant’s consent is a Fourth Amendment violation.

Administrative warrants are easier for municipal agents to get than general warrants because ostensibly inspections have nothing to do with a suspected crime.

Peccola noted another line in Barstow’s ordinance which states: “The Building Official"" currently Heldreth “in his discretion may require inspections by other city departments and/or San Bernardino County enforcement agencies including but not limited to the County Health Department and Barstow Fire Department.”

This means both city and county police officers are “absolutely” included among Barstow’s potential inspection agents according to Peccola.

“Even if they don’t show up with law enforcement if they see something they subjectively think might be indicia of criminal activity or drug trafficking or whatever what’s to stop them from picking up their phone and calling the police immediately?” he said adding that one chief inspector in a city he previously litigated against did exactly that.

Peccola argues that these programs are still “very invasive” without police involvement allowing government officials to see the medications people take enter children’s rooms and learn about someone’s religion political beliefs and economic status.

He also called them a “cash grab.”

“It’s an end-run around the Fourth Amendment when you can just go straight for the financial jugular with the landlord” he said “and it creates this very coercive social pressure with landlords who want to respect their tenants’ privacy.”

'You got two classes of citizens'

Barstow’s program is targeted at apartments and homes in which people pay rent to live. It is also among the cornerstones of a new “environmental justice element” in Barstow’s General Plan approved by the City Council at an Aug. 2 meeting.

Anyone who owns at least one rental property in Barstow will have to provide the city either their own home address and contact information or that of a “local authorized contact representative” within 15 miles of the property.

Whichever they choose that person must “be accessible to the City” at all times: “24 hours a day 7 days a week” the ordinance states.

City officials plan to fund the program by charging rental-property owners annual fees alongside new inspections at least once a year.

Paying the fees is necessary for the property owners to maintain a permit or “certificate of compliance.” These owners must apply to the city each year to obtain and renew the permit.

An inspection must be conducted within 30 calendar days of an owner submitting an application the ordinance states. If any violations are identified by a city agent a second re-inspection must be conducted within 14 days.

If a property logs consistently perfect scores the terms may be eased to new inspections every two years and the annual fee drops by 50% the ordinance states.

For owners who are subject to new inspections once every year city agents on an initial inspection will personally enter “50-60% of all units on the property” meaning individual homes or apartments. “Any major violation found will result in 100% inspection of all units” on a follow-up visit.

The ordinance does not specify restrictions on what the city can do in response to repeated violations of its rental-inspection program. It implies that extraordinary fines will be leveled at first and states that any person and property in continued violation will eventually “be considered a public nuisance and subject to abatement procedures.”

The City Council approved fees requiring owners to pay $100 per year for each parcel of land on which they own at least one rental unit. Then they must pay $10 for each additional unit.

This means the yearly fee on one parcel would be $110 for a duplex $190 for a complex with 10 apartments and $1090 for a complex with 100 apartments.

The city will hire two new inspectors and one office assistant to focus on the inspections.

The cost of compensating those three individuals will start at about $227000 and increase to about $278000 with yearly raises city documents show.

The bulk of these new costs some local landlords say will likely be passed down to Barstow renters.

The city will notify owners about the need to renew their permit. Heldreth said at the June 21 meeting that he and the personnel employed under him are willing to work with property owners who may not be able to meet the 30-day window or a certain notification deadline.

“If they can’t be there within the 30 days well maybe we’ll be there on the 40th day. And I’m OK with that” he said.

All major and minor violations logged by inspectors and all violation-free inspections will be accounted for in a city database. An inspection report will also be written for each property. Both the database and the reports will be available to the public upon request.

Many residents in Barstow want the city to take more action to address issues like homelessness and vacant buildings that have become ever more present in its streets.

Yet some feel this program casts too broad of a net.

One local landlord who runs an apartment complex with hundreds of tenants said they had no idea about the inspections ordinance until the Daily Press asked them about it but that they run a fair operation.

The landlord declined a request to be named in this article citing worries that a public critique of the policy may lead to them and their renters facing punitive inspections as retribution. They were specifically upset to learn hotels were exempt from the policy.

Gwin the landlord who jumpstarted public opposition to the program in Barstow first expressed his outrage at the Aug. 30 City Council meeting.

“I’ve invested my life in this town” Gwin told the Daily Press. He runs Hillside Apartments and says it is one of the oldest businesses in Barstow having begun in the early 20th century.

Lara Hartley who has been one of Gwin's renters for years said he is ""one of the good landlords."" She said she is seriously considering leaving Barstow if the inspections policy goes into effect.

Gwin has spoken at most public City Hall meetings in the last month and a larger group of local renters and tenants has joined him each time.

Councilman Tim Silva at the last meeting Sept. 20 said he would return the rental ordinance to the city's Rules and Policy Committee for another review though it is unclear what changes could actually come from that. Councilwoman Barbara Rose also suggested that a Town Hall-style meeting be held for input from landlords.

Gwin has made it clear that he wants more than just a few tweaks to the policy.

“You got two classes of citizens here in Barstow now” he said at the meeting last week.

But there are a few everyday items that may not be top of mind when we regularly clean including what's in our wallets.

When buying groceries grabbing takeout or making any other purchase we're likely to touch our credit cards. Whether you're tapping to pay swiping your card or inserting the chip that means your card is touching surfaces that hundreds of other people's credit cards have also touched recently.

You may or may not have thought of cleaning your cards but disinfecting them periodically can avoid the accumulation of germs from forming.

Here's our useful guide on how to clean your credit cards effectively.

How to clean your credit cards

Fortunately disinfecting your credit cards isn't a complicated process and you can do so with everyday household items.

The easiest way to clean your cards is by using the same technique you use for your hands: soap and warm water. Like washing your hands you should lightly rub for at least 20 seconds. You can sing ""Happy Birthday"" twice through or get more creative — Dolly Parton's ""Jolene"" has a chorus that lasts 20 seconds as does Beyonce's ""Love on Top."" I'm a fan of using the chorus to the song ""My Shot"" from Hamilton.

You can also use one of the EPA-approved disinfectants against COVID-19 which includes many household wipes and sprays such as Clorox. For the tech lover you can use a UV sterilizer since UV rays kill viruses and bacteria. Keep in mind that your signature may wash off the card when you use soap or a disinfectant. You can always resign the card if this happens.

Will disinfectants damage my credit card?

Short answer? No.

Credit cards both plastic and metal are made to be waterproof. Your card should also be able to withstand products such as bleach vinegar or alcohol. I don't recommend soaking your cards in any corrosive liquids but a quick wipe-down with a Clorox wipe or a 20-second wash with some soap and water won't render them unusable.

In fact keeping your cards clean could help them stand the test of time. Dirt and grime can build up on your cards which can scrape at EMV chips and magnetic strips. It's not a good idea to scrub your cards with an abrasive of any kind but a gentle cleaning can help keep dirt from building up while killing germs — two birds one Clorox wipe.

Tips for using card readers and pin pads

Even if your cards are fully disinfected you might have to interact with germy apparatuses such as card readers and pin pads that you use to make payments at stores. In the U.S. chip-and-signature is the most common authorization method for payments. This means that even if you have a contactless card you might need to use a stylus your finger or a pen to sign your signature. Those surfaces have been touched by anyone who came before you.

The best thing you can do is immediately disinfect your hands after you pay and avoid touching your face (which is a best practice you should be following anyway).

Bottom line

As the pandemic lingers on there's been a greater emphasis on cleanliness and disinfecting whenever possible. When it comes to your credit cards good ole' soap and water will do the job just fine or you can use a disinfectant to gently wipe down your cards after you use them.

Speaking to Rolling Stone Magazine at the start of the pandemic Fagen revealed he would be spending quarantine “hangin’ tight in the Apple baby gargling Clorox under a sunlamp.”

In a more recent interview the lead singer and keyboardist explained how the extended lockdowns of the pandemic have worked out for him. Once the pandemic rolled on for a while the co-founder said he “ended up writing almost an album’s worth of tunes for a solo record”.

Although Fagen says it’s still too early to reveal too many details he said he has already made a few demos for his new tracks. Fagen is “really excited about it” and revealed how some of these tracks are very “personal” to him.

“There’s one I particularly like called ‘The Stellar Bartender.’ [Laughs] About a very empathetic bartender.”

The Steely Dan frontman recently released a pair of new live albums Northeast Corridor — which boasts a smattering of Steely Dan songs — and a full live version of his 1982 solo record The Nightfly. Fagen looks set to return to the road with Steely Dan next month with a run of gigs beginning in Baltimore USA on October 25th. Earlier shows scheduled in October have been recently pushed back until 2022.

According to the co-founder Fagen says the band is due to kick off rehearsals in the next few weeks. However he is confident there will not be too much rust to shake off despite more than a year off the road.

“We’re just going to brush up on some stuff maybe add a few new things to dress up the show a little bit” Fagen said before adding with a laugh: “It’s really a convenience that everyone can read music. You don’t have to sing parts we’ve got charts — although most of the players don’t even use the charts anymore.”

Further in the interview Fagen spoke of the joy he is feeling in returning to live performances after so much time writing music alone during quarantine. The singer said he has “really missed it” having not played with anyone else since 2020. “I’m really really into it.”

Meanwhile Fagen recently explained how around a “thousand lawyers” are currently trying to iron out a royalties dispute between the co-founder and Walter Becker’s widow Delia read more.",,,,,,,,,

Ko the No. 2 player in the world played in the morning on the windy Bay Course at Seaview and ran off five birdies in a six-hole stretch on the front nine. She had to settle for only one bogey on the back nine and was the first to post at 11-under 131.

Park is the No. 3 player in the world and putted well all day her hallmark. She holed a 30-foot birdie on No. 6 and had a 6-foot par save on the next hole.

They were two shots ahead of ANA Inspiration winner Patty Tavatanakit who birdied the final hole to cap off a bogey-free 65.

Brittany Lincicome (67) and Nanna Koerstz Madsen (68) were three shots behind going into the final round.

Ko has a recent history of playing her best golf at the end of the year. She sat out most of the LPGA Tour season last year staying home during the pandemic and returned to capture the CME Group Tour Championship.

Now she sets her sights on a third victory in her past five starts on the LPGA Tour. That doesn't include the Olympics where Ko tied for ninth.

""I like it better than earlier in the year"" said Ko who changed swing coaches late last year and said she believes all parts of her game are starting to come together.

Park won her first start of the year at the Kia Classic but has been struggling of late by going six consecutive events outside the top 10.

""I remember putting good in Kia and then earlier in the season"" Park said. ""And then middle of the season to the end of the season not as good. I feel like this week is almost back to like where I was putting really good earlier in the season.""

Nelly Korda the No. 1 player in women's golf has not played since the U.S. lost in the Solheim Cup a month ago. That leaves Ko and Park both multiple major champions and former No. 1 players to battle it out.

""Jin Young is really really good player too so I think it'll be really fun out there tomorrow playing with her"" Park said. ""Obviously you need some birdies out here to win tomorrow. Knowing that No. 2 player in the world is hunting for the same thing I am hunting for definitely need to put some good performance. Good motivation to play for.""

Not to be overlooked is Tavatanakit the first major champion of the year who is well within range.

""I was thinking since I'm two back I would say 4 or 5 under tomorrow would put myself in a really good position because I know how good they are"" Tavatanakit said. ""No pressure no expectations. I'm just going to go out there and play golf and hopefully I get up to where I think I should be.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Applications have opened for the Green Living Grant Scheme.

The Scheme has been created to assist Island residents with the reduction of carbon emissions and household energy bills and provides financial assistance up to a maximum of £6000 to help make residential properties more energy efficient.

The Scheme operates in two parts the first provides a Manx Home Energy Audit and the second provides funding of up to 50% towards the cost of energy saving solutions identified by the Manx Home Energy Audit.

The Manx Home Energy Audits will be based on the UK Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) and will provide an overall energy rating and a list of energy saving solutions in priority order for each property.

To qualify for funding towards improvement works home owners landlords (up to six properties) and tenants must be in receipt of this certificate have a gross household annual income of below £112k (before tax allowances) and have received an asset rating of ‘D’ or lower for their property.

Once the improvement works have been completed a second Manx Home Energy Audit will be completed to measure the improvements made and to recertify the energy rating of the property.

Coca-Cola is going to great lengths to transport materials by using bulk shipping vessels.

Bulk shipping vessels are typically used for raw materials like grain and coal.

The ongoing shipping crisis has caused major supply chain disruptions making many goods harder to find and more expensive.



See more stories on Insider's business page.

Coca-Cola is going to great lengths to transport materials by using bulk shipping vessels amid the ongoing shipping crisis.

The carriers which are normally used for loose goods such as grain coal and other raw materials were chosen because the beverage company could not get the shipping containers and cargo space needed for transportation Alan Smith the procurement director of global logistics at Coca-Cola wrote in a post on LinkedIn. The company is currently using three of these ships to transport manufacturing materials.

Due to shortages delaying transportation and in extreme cases halting it altogether companies like Coca-Cola have had to get creative with the transportation of goods and materials across the world.

Retailers like Costco and Target have chartered their own cargo ships finding creative ways to combat these issues but ports are still backed up causing mass delays because of the ongoing labor shortage and the increasing number of ships back on the ocean.

Coca-Cola is attempting to avoid major ports to further prevent delays according to comments on Smith's post.

""For these we are heading to some non-congested ports so we are hoping for a smooth discharge"" Smith wrote. ""Good coordination is vital on both the planning and the operations side for loading and discharge.""

Smith did not respond to Insider's request for comment on the vessel before publishing.

Some noticing Smith's post have made note of it on social media recognizing that this mode of transporting materials is abnormal for a company like Coca-Cola.

""No container no problem"" one user wrote on Twitter. ""No this isn't normal and it isn't really a great sign either.""

The ongoing supply chain crisis combined with shipping delays have already created shortages and price hikes across the country. In September Coca-Cola's New York distributor said it's having a hard time recruiting truckers further disrupting the supply chain Insider reported. Other goods and products like paper Nike sneakers toilet paper computer chips and plastic goods are also in short supply as manufacturers try to meet demand amid the delays.

Here's what the 'Born This Way' artist had to say about some pop culture references in the production.

Lady Gaga and Beyoncé’s “Telephone” is one of the most iconic collaborations in pop music with the music video continuing to earn views to this day. During one interview the “Born This Way” artist shared some insight regarding the pop culture references in the video clip.

Lady Gaga and Beyoncé collaborated for the iconic pop song ‘Telephone’

They left their heads and their hearts on the dance floor. 2009 brought one of pop music’s most iconic collaborations. That was for the song “Telephone” performed by “Born This Way” singer Lady Gaga and “Crazy in Love” singer Beyoncé Knowles-Carter.

This song debuted in conjunction with The Fame Monster earning over 375 plays on Spotify in the process. It received the MTV Video Music Award for Best Collaboration and the NRJ Music Award for Video of the Year.

Additionally Lady Gaga played a role in the creative process for this song and its corresponding music video. During one interview she revealed where some of the inspiration came from regarding scenes from “Telephone.”

Lady Gaga actually wore Coca-Cola rollers in her hair before the ‘Telephone’ music video

This music video which is over 9 minutes long features Lady Gaga and Beyoncé as they went from jailhouse rockers to runaways. Each wore unique and colorful outfits and Lady Gaga even sported some soda can hair rollers.

During an interview with Ryan Seacrest according to MTV News Lady Gaga shared some of the pop culture references sprinkled throughout this video. That includes the inspiration behind her hair rollers.

“My mom used to do that when I was a kid” she explained. “‘Cause if we didn’t have any rollers in the house she’d slice up some Coke cans and then she’d heat them up and pin them in her hair.”

Lady Gaga shared her love for Beyoncé

Outside of “Telephone” Beyoncé collaborated with other award-winning artists. Her album The Lion King: The Gift featured performers like Burna Boy Pharrell Williams Jay-Z and Major Lazer. Gaga shared her thoughts on working with the “Love On Top” singer.

“We’re not competitive at all. We’re so different we respect each other so much and she’s so kind and we really get along” Gaga said during an interview with MTV News regarding her relationship with Beyoncé.

“She was so courageous in this video” she continued. “She trusted me because she likes my work and she knew that I love her and it’s a mutual respect. It ended up being a masterpiece because she was so courageous but I’m sure you can imagine it’s a bit daunting sometimes.”

There’s no word regarding if (or when) Lady Gaga and Beyoncé will work together to create more music.

Sugarcane farmers Catchment Solutions WWF Australia Coca-Cola Foundation NRM Groups and the Australian Government have been working in partnership through Project Catalyst to help reduce the impact of agricultural runoff on the Great Barrier Reef.

Project Catalyst is a pioneering partnership between more than 130 innovative Queensland cane growers Catchment Solutions the Australian Government WWF and The Coca-Cola Foundation and working with Natural Resource Management ( NRM ) groups and independent agribusinesses.

The project aims to support sugarcane growers to identify and trial cutting-edge practices to improve farm practices that can reduce negative environmental impact while also enhancing crop production and boosting farm viability.

Together Project Catalyst partners are demonstrating that more efficient farming practices and improved water quality are the same sides of the coin; they are complementary not conflicting outcomes.

Project Catalyst commenced in 2009 as a pioneering partnership between WWF the Coca-Cola Foundation Reef Catchments and a dedicated group of 19 cane farmers in the Mackay Whitsunday region of the state of Queensland.

In 2011 the project expanded into the Burdekin and Wet Tropics and now has more than 130 participating sugarcane growers who through their own innovation have improved the quality of 150 billion litres of water flowing into the reef and reduced runoff by 180 tonnes per year. In 2013 the Australian Government entered into the partnership providing funding through the Reef Program with continued funding support in 2016 through the Reef Trust.

Partner details

Cane farmers are using their land to trial new cane farming practices and are helping to demonstrate and communicate the techniques that work.

A number of NRM Groups have been involved in the project throughout its 10 year history delivering farm grants via the Australian Government that has assisted Project Catalyst growers to secure crop and farm extension support within each region. Reef Catchments Limited initiated and managed the original Project Catalyst and since 2016 Catchment Solutions have managed Project Catalyst to identify implement and validate pathways to rapid adoption of enhanced management practices.

WWF Australia collaborate with Project Catalyst cane growers to improve their environmental practices and to promote sustainable agriculture.

The Coca-Cola Foundation has contributed around $6.5 million to Project Catalyst. Its commitment has helped the company achieve its ambitious global sustainability goals.

The Australian Government has supported the project through $6 million in funding through the Reef Trust and the Reef Program which is contributing to meeting the Reef 2050 Plan water quality targets.

In addition a group of supporting agribusiness suppliers invest both cash and in-kind resources on an annual basis.

(Takumi Wakai)

Lemon-flavored alcoholic drinks have quickly filled the market void in Japan created by younger consumers’ diminished thirst for beer.

Beverage makers are racing to pitch lemon-based ready-to-drink products such as canned “chuhai” soda-mixed shochu which can be consumed without being diluted with soda water or other liquids.

Brisk sales of earlier beverages have resulted in increased market prices for the newer potables.

Coca-Cola (Japan) Co. in June released Nomel’s Hard Lemonade brand which comes in three different alcoholic strengths and tastes.

The company entered the Japanese alcohol market for the first time in 2019 with its Lemon-Dou lemon sour.

Its second booze product in Japan is also a lemon-featured ready-to-drink one.

“We expect the market of lemon-flavored RTD (ready-to-drink) products to grow” said Patrick Savstrom a senior brand manager involved in the development of both products. “Pitching brands with diverse features will further accelerate the expansion.”

Suntory Spirits Ltd. in 2019 began selling Kodawari Sakaba no Lemon Sour.

Sapporo Breweries Ltd. and Kirin Brewery Co. this past spring put out Koime No Lemon Sour and Hakko Lemon Sour respectively. All those items have proven very sought-after.

PRICES SET HIGH

Data from research firm Intage Inc. show sales of ready-to-drink products rose 10 percent in 2020 from the previous year to 419.1 billion yen ($3.82 billion) with those using lemon accounting for 171.2 billion yen or 40 percent of the total.

The year-on-year growth rate of 35 percent for lemon-featured products was higher than that for the entire ready-to-drink market.

The fruit’s refreshing aroma is said to go well with various kinds of food and some brands offer differing alcoholic potency and flavors to cater to a wide range of consumer preferences.

The popularity of lemon-based drinks has caught the eye of beer makers whose sales have shrunk for 16 straight years.

“We must make the maximum possible efforts in the category (of lemon-based products) now so that we will nurture strong brands” said a public relations representative of a major beer brewer.

The lemon-drink boom has generated an unexpected effect.

Conventional ready-to-drink products carry cheaper price tags to promote their sales such as a 350-milliliter can for 110 yen after tax.

But Coca-Cola (Japan)’s Lemon-Dou has sold well despite its more expensive price of around 165 yen. The price of Hakko Lemon Sour put on sale by Kirin Brewery in spring is as high as 170 yen.

“A new market has been established for pricey RTD products partly because of drinks released earlier” said a publicity official of Kirin Brewery. “This made us realize that (expensive) RTD products can be accepted if they provide higher value.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vdGltZXMuY29tL2N1c3RvbWVycy11cmdlLXN0YXJidWNrcy10by1jaGFuZ2UtbWFya2V0aW5nLXBvbGljeS0xNjE4NDA20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lemon-flavored alcoholic drinks taking a bigger slice of Japan's beverage market,"Beverage makers such as Coca-Cola and Suntory are racing to pitch lemon-based alcoholic drinks to address the market for younger consumers who have diminished their thirst for beer.

But while you can change your clothes you can’t alter your DNA: and the extent to which Cognizant’s Indian talent fuels its global business and ambitions remains an untold story of desi technological talent.

Cognizant is a very interesting example of how some infotech companies deliberately shed their Indianness to become truly global entities in search of worldwide name and fame.

In a separate announcement the corporate social media tool LinkedIn recently ranked it at Number 2 of 25 among top companies in India to work for. Cognizant calls its employees “associates” and they number just over 2 lakh in India — over 70 per cent of its global people power.

Cognizant calls this its ‘Ninja’ hiring process which will enable it to make 700 job offers every day for many weeks this year.

It also plans to hire another 1 lakh working professionals as lateral entrants.

The massively Indian-talent driven US-headquartered Cognizant said last month it planned to immediately fill some 30000 positions in this country with fresh engineering graduates and a possible 45000 next year to provide global support services for its global customer base of some 5.6 million users of largely Microsoft tools like Windows Office and Azure.

Amidst the doom-n-gloom scenario in the jobs market with so many corporates struggling to survive in a post-Covid world one technology player bucked the trend.

The company was founded in 1994 as Dun and Bradstreet India and was a joint venture with Satyam Computers with Srini Raju its first CEO.

In 1997 it was renamed as Cognizant Technology Solutions and its headquarters were shifted from Chennai to the United States by the then-CEO Kumar Mahadeva.

Like other IT companies based in India Cognizant leveraged the Y2K or Year 2000 business but cannily did not put all its eggs in one basket. It survived the dotcom bust by taking on the maintenance projects that larger IT services companies did not bother about.

Booming business

From 1998 first as President and then as CEO Cognizant was steered by Lakshmi Narayanan who refocused Cognizant on Business Process Operations and consulting.

It proved to be a milch cow for the company. Under its co-founder and CEO from 2007 for 12 years Kenya-born Indian Francisco D’Souza Cognizant saw booming business and revenues.

Even after the company inducted Irish-born Brian Humphries a veteran with stints at Vodafone Dell and HP as CEO in 2019 Indians continue to head most of the key verticals — former Mphasis CEO Ganesh Ayyar is President of digital business operations while ex-IBM-veteran Rajesh Nambiar is Chairman of Cognizant India and head of digital business and technology.

Four of the company’s 12 senior executives are Indian and its innovative epicentre lies in Chennai rather than New Jersey USA.

The changeover to a non-Indian CEO after 25 years did see the departure of quite a few senior executives as Humphries brought in his own team; but to call it an exodus of talent as some sections of the media did seems like an overstatement.

More worrisome for the current leadership in India is this apparent contradiction: While Cognizant is a very big supporter of Indian talent it also suffers an attrition rate that at around 18 per cent is above the national average.

Examining its human resource practices to ensure that its 2-lakh-strong Indian workforce has the motivation to stick around might be a priority in coming months.

Whenever the history of Indian Information Technology is told Cognizant finds a place among the Famous Five — turn-of-the-century pioneers including TCS Infosys Wipro and HCL who made ‘India IT’ a globally respected brand.

Today Cognizant has slipped out of the Top Ten tech players ranking in India — but often forgotten is one fact: at an international level the company is among the Top 10 or Top 15 (depending on who does the ranking) Infotech companies going by revenue.

With the most recent annual earnings of $ 16.5 billion Cognizant is in the global company of only one other Indian player — TCS.

The word ‘digital’ is to be found in all of Cognizant’s offerings across sectors like healthcare banking financial services retail and communications — and helping her clients harness digital technology and artificial intelligence as they start on the road to a post-pandemic recovery is the challenge.

It may be too soon to predict how it goes — but one thing is certain: the skills that make this happen at Cognizant will be — mostly — Indian.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vanVzdHdvbWVuc3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vcmVhZHMvdGVhbS11c2FzLWpvcmRhbi1sYXJzb24tZXhwbGFpbnMtaGVyLWdvdmVybm9yLW5pY2tuYW1lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Team USA’s Jordan Larson explains her ‘Governor’ nickname,"Team USA volleyball star Jordan Larson is known to many by her catchy nickname “the Governor” but how did it come to be? The Olympic gold medalist credits Team USA teammate Foluke Akinradewo Gunderson for the memorable moniker.

“We’ve been friends for over ten years and she is one of my best friends” says Larson adding that she and Foluke started off as rivals evening talking “a little crap” against each other in the 2006 NCAA finals.

Their friendship however flourished on the National Team traveling the world together. And on one of those trips the infamous “Governor” nickname came to be.

“We were in Thailand for our National Team games and all of a sudden I see this guy at the end of the fan section and he’s wearing a Nebraska shirt and Foluke is like ‘seriously'” Larson said.

Larson grew up in Nebraska and was a star on the Cornhuskers volleyball team helping them win the national title in 2006.

The fan in Thailand ended up flagging Larson down telling her he knew her dad. When Foluke went to share the unlikely story with her brother he responded “I mean not surprising — [Larson] is like the Governor of Nebraska.”

And so the nickname was born.

Foluke who Larson calls the nickname queen soon started referring to Larson exlusively as “the Governor” and what once began as a joke quickly caught on.

“So it’s become part of the brand but it’s more of a joke than anything” says Larson who now answers to several variations of “the Governor” nickname.

100 Thieves Founder & CEO Matthew “Nadeshot” Haag in a statement alluded to the importance of teaming up another L.A.-based outfit. DSC founder & CEO Michael Dubin has invested in the SoCal esports scene before being among the investors in L.A.-based high school esports league PlayVS in 2018.



100 Thieves is joining CDL in a move that is important for both sides; the organization and Haag have long been associated with Call of Duty Esports but 100 Thieves originally didn’t buy into the league when it reorganized as a franchised property with geo-located teams last year. The organization eventually decided to join for 2021 in part because it found a middle-ground solution of keeping its Thieves name and by being able to secure a slot in the L.A. market after Immortals Gaming Club decided to divest from CDL.



The two content series that DSC will sponsor are a docu-series on the 2021 season and a commentary series hosted by a former CDL player. 100 Thieves says that it will also work DSC into other content live-streamed events and limited-edition items. DSC says it is striking this partnership at a time when it is expanding into omnichannel stores with new products.

DSC’s new tie-up with 100 Thieves may also help grow its social media presence which currently lags behind many personal care competitors per data from SportsAtlas. DSC currently has just under 316000 social media followers across Facebook Twitter and Instagram which puts it below Procter & Gamble (374000) but above Sport Clips (163000). Leaders on social media in the personal care space are Unilever (4.22 million followers) Axe Body Spray (4.04 million) and Colgate-Palmolive (3.79 million).



Other partners of 100 Thieves include AT&T Rocket Mortgage Totino’s Chipotle and JBL.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bW1pdGV4cHJlc3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvc2hvcGVlLTEwLTEwLWJyYW5kcy1mZXN0aXZhbC0yMDIxLWtpbS1jaGl1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shopee kicks off 10.10 Brands Festival with Kim Chiu as brand ambassador,MANILA Philippines – Shopee the leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan introduces its newest brand ambassador Kim Chiu alongside the launch of the 10.10 Brands Festival its biggest brands sale of the year.

DENVER — It's football season and many people are surprised when they turn on the game to find the broadcasters are speaking Spanish while all the other TV programming is in English.

NBC and other networks offer Spanish-language broadcasts for certain programs and events including many sporting events. Viewers can use a setting on their TVs to switch between languages.

If you're hearing the broadcast in another language it's likely a setting on your TV was accidentally changed.

Spanish audio is only offered on some programs and when Spanish isn't offered English audio is usually broadcast. That's why you may not notice the setting was changed until you turn on a certain program.

The steps for restoring the broadcast to your preferred language are different on every TV but there are a few common places to check before breaking out the owner's manual.

First your remote may have a button labeled ""SAP"" ""MST"" or ""AUDIO."" If so push that button to cycle through the choices until you find the correct option.

If that doesn't work try pressing the ""MENU"" button on your remote and navigating to the audio settings. Find the list of available languages and select the one you'd like.

If the broadcast is still in another language and you're watching the game on cable you may need to adjust a setting in your cable box. Using your cable remote navigate to the menu then the audio settings. Choose the language you'd like.

If you've checked all of these settings and you're still hearing the game in another language or if you're having difficulty finding the correct setting on your TV or cable box refer to the television owner's manual or contact your cable provider.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zZmdhdGUvbmFtZS9rYXJsLWtsdWNrLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTE4ODI4OTQ50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Karl Kluck Obituary (2021) - San Francisco CA - San Francisco Chronicle,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/sfgate/name/karl-kluck-obituary?id=18828949 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zZmdhdGUvbmFtZS9rYXJsLWtsdWNrLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTE4ODI4OTQ50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL21hcmlvbmV0dGUtdHJhaWxlci1tb3ZpZS1lbGJlcnQtdmFuLXN0cmllbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marionette Trailer Promises a Supernatural Thriller About Kid Who Draws the Future,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL21hcmlvbmV0dGUtdHJhaWxlci1tb3ZpZS1lbGJlcnQtdmFuLXN0cmllbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL25ld3MvdGVjaC9zcXVpZC1nYW1lLW5ldGZsaXgtc3VlZC1ieS1zb3V0aC1rb3JlYW4tYnJvYWRiYW5kLWZpcm0tYWZ0ZXItdHJhZmZpYy1zdXJnZS1mcm9tLWhpdC1zaG93LTQyNzQzNjYuaHRtbNIBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL3RlY2gvc3F1aWQtZ2FtZS1uZXRmbGl4LXN1ZWQtYnktc291dGgta29yZWFuLWJyb2FkYmFuZC1maXJtLWFmdGVyLXRyYWZmaWMtc3VyZ2UtZnJvbS1oaXQtc2hvdy00Mjc0MzY2Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Squid Game: Netflix Sued By South Korean Broadband Firm After Traffic Surge From Hit Show,"South Korean Internet service provider SK Broadband has sued Netflix to pay for costs from increased network traffic and maintenance work because of a surge of viewers to the US firm’s content an SK spokesperson said on Friday. The move comes after a Seoul court said Netflix should “reasonably” give something in return to the internet service provider for network usage and multiple South Korean lawmakers have spoken out against content providers who do not pay for network usage despite generating explosive traffic.

Netflix said it will review SK Broadband’s claim and seek dialogue and explore ways in the meantime to work with SK Broadband to ensure customers are not affected. The popularity of the hit series “Squid Game” and other offerings have underscored Netflix’s status as the country’s second-largest data traffic generator after Google’s YouTube but the two are the only ones to not pay network usage fees which other content providers such as Amazon Apple and Facebook are paying SK said.

Netflix’s data traffic handled by SK jumped 24 times from May 2018 to 1.2 trillion bits of data processed per second as of September SK said riding on the success of several Netflix productions from Korea including “Squid Game” and “DP.”

SK Broadband said it lodged a lawsuit against Netflix for it to pay for using SK’s networks since Netflix began using SK’s dedicated line starting 2018 to deliver increasingly larger amounts of data-heavy high-definition video content to viewers in Korea from servers in Japan and Hong Kong.

Last year Netflix had brought its own lawsuit on whether it had any obligation to pay SK for network usage arguing Netflix’s duty ends with creating content and leaving it accessible. It said SK’s expenses were incurred while fulfilling its contractual obligations to Internet users and delivery in the Internet world is “free of charge as a principle” according to court documents.

But the Seoul Central District Court ruled against Netflix in June saying that SK is seen as providing “a service provided at a cost” and it is “reasonable” for Netflix to be “obligated to provide something in return for the service”.

SK estimated the network usage fee Netflix needed to pay was about 27.2 billion won ($22.9 million) in 2020 alone the court document said. Netflix has appealed against the ruling court records showed with fresh proceedings to start in late December.

Netflix said in a statement on Wednesday that it contributed to the creation of about 16000 jobs in South Korea stemming from about 770 billion won in investments as well as an economic effect of about 5.6 trillion won.

Ruling party lawmaker Kim Sang-hee said on Wednesday that out of South Korea’s top 10 data traffic generators 78.5% of the traffic came from foreign content providers up from 73.1 percent a year earlier with “Google-YouTube and Netflix that account for the majority turning a blind eye to network usage fees”.

In the United States Netflix has been paying a fee to broadband provider Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) for over seven years for faster streaming speeds.

It's fashionable to call every mid-range phone a ‘flagship killer' but there is still a case to make for actual flagships /smart-living/innovation/is-the-flagship-smartphone-dead-111633077645028.html 111633077645028 story

Baibhav Mishra knows a thing or two about investments. As consultant to a well-known family office for high-net-worth individuals based out of Bhubaneswar the 25-year-old measures returns on investments both in the markets and in his annual investment in an iPhone. He has picked up a new iPhone every year for the past seven years and owns a 12 Pro right now. His rationale? “Why compromise on a device that I use for well over 10-15 hours of my day?”

Doesn’t spending upwards of ₹60000 or more on a premium flagship fly in the face of recent wisdom which proclaims mid-range flagship phones have killed the need for premium flagships? With phones like the Mi 11X Pro Realme GT and iQOO 7 Legend packing the latest chips from Qualcomm at sub- ₹40000 price points you would think it was time to start writing eulogies for phones that retail at twice the price.

Not quite. Premium flagships like the latest crop of iPhones or Samsung’s S series lineup and Z series of foldables still have a trick (or several!) that differentiate them from the rest of the pack factors that take the sting out of that sticker shock.

Display tech: Buying a mid-range phone these days pretty much guarantees vivid colours and fluidity across the user interface and most apps thanks to the proliferation of high refresh rate 90Hz/120Hz AMOLED displays. Screen resolutions stay capped at full-HD 1080p resolutions as do maximum screen brightness and visibility when used in the bright outdoors. You have to step up to the top-tier Android phones to unlock truly pixel-dense quad-HD (1440p) displays with average brightness levels approaching 900-1000 nits the latter significantly improving sunlight visibility.

In fact most flagships are able to bump up peak brightness levels to 1200-1500 nits with the Mi 11 Ultra taking it all the way to 1700 nits which enhances the experience of watching high dynamic range (HDR) movies and TV shows in HDR10+ or Dolby Vision formats. Currently the must-haves for high-fidelity entertainment HDR formats allow for brighter highlights and a wider range of colour details for closer-to-life colour reproduction and details even in the darker scenes just as the director intended.

Cameras: By any measure camera tech and performance are what separate the “flagship killers” and the heavy hitters in the premium flagships. Whether it’s the marquee stuff like the super-zoom capabilities of the Mi 11 Ultra and the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra or the low-light wizardry of the gimbal-setup on the Vivo X60/X70 Pro+ or even the sensor-shift image-stabilised Dolby Vision HDR video recording on the iPhone 12/13 series one thing is common to most flagships—the ability to handle a range of shooting scenarios (including trickily lit and low-light conditions) with a sense of unfaltering confidence.

Mid-range phones by and large are guilty of stacking multiple cameras to somehow cobble together a “quad-camera setup” but if you peek into the camera reviews you will often find a strong primary sensor to be the only element worth writing home about with an ultrawide with colour science issues and heavy distortion around the edges a 2x-3x zoom that trips over itself in low light and a macro that may as well have stayed home.

Durability: You are spending more on your phone so it stands to reason you should expect it to withstand the elements. Mid-range phones have some level of water ingress protection such as splash-proof coating on the ports but typically stop shy of having a full IP68 rating. An IP rating of 68 certifies the phone to be dust-tight and protected against immersion in water 1.5m deep for a maximum of 30 minutes. These tests are conducted by independent agencies which tack on costs somewhere around $30 above the price of the phone that are hard to absorb in budget devices but are often flaunted as differentiators in flagship devices like the iPhones and even the new Z Fold 3 foldable.

Likewise for Gorilla Glass Victus the latest iteration of Corning’s protective glass which offers drop protection for falls from up to 2m and better scratch resistance for phones like the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra (Apple’s iPhone 12 series onwards sports Ceramic Shield protective glass where small ceramic nanocrystals are embedded in the glass for rigidity and scratch resistance).

Wireless charging: For a standard that has been around as long as Qi wireless charging you would be surprised at how few phones support the convenience of dropping your phone on to a wireless charging pad. Sure you get blazing wired charging speeds of 65W on most mid-rangers but a feature that’s considered table stakes for premium flagships is conspicuously absent in just about any current-gen phone under ₹50000.

Premium flagships like Samsung’s Z series of foldables still have a trick that differentiate them from the rest of the pack (Courtesy: Samsung)

Hygiene elements: Other trappings that are assured when you pay top dollar are a stereo speaker setup that doesn’t distort at higher volumes and at least 128 GB of internal storage with the option of going up to 512 GB for all your storage-busting 4K videos. Then there’s what is arguably the biggest and most underrated feature in flagship phones—the haptic touch feedback. How the phone’s vibration motor responds with tactile feedback when you touch the flat sheet of the phone display is as important as a fast touch response and you only ever hear of haptics when a phone either nails it (the iPhone the Mi 11 Ultra the OnePlus 9 Pro and the Samsung S21 Ultra are shining examples) or does a really poor job of it.

Longevity and resale: Though brands like Samsung have upped the software update game with committed Android updates for up to three years (and four years of security updates) you will notice that the bulk of the devices supported fall into the flagship S Note and foldables series. It’s a rather straightforward future-proofing logic—phones with current flagship chips and a healthy amount of brand commitment just end up getting supported by Google for longer. As Rajat Agrawal a former technology journalist who now works for a global tech giant and is still happy with this 2018 iPhone XS says: “Apart from being good for the planet I would like my phone to last me at least three years on both hardware and software. Unfortunately none of the cheaper smartphones give me that confidence and so the choice is that you either spend $1000 once on a phone that lasts three years or more and still gives you $250 when you trade it in…or buy a $250-300 smartphone every year.”

Then comes the aspect of resale value. Based on anecdotal evidence high-end flagships hold significant resale value. Joy M. an IT consultant who splurges on the latest gadgets says that “when he decides to sell the gadgets a year later he can often quickly recover 55-60% of the initial cost”.

Thinking of picking up a flagship phone?

A secondary work computer: Many justify these purchases for the sheer productivity gains they deliver. Kiran Jonnalagadda who heads a tech community platform sees flagships as necessary investments as “modern work is as much phone-driven as laptop-driven” necessitating “top-end devices with an expected lifetime of three years”. Vaibhav Gadodia a senior leader in a software company relies on the “tiniest efficiency reliability performance and experience gains” that flagships deliver and since he keeps devices for longer he opts to “buy the highest-end smartphone that will stay efficient longer”. Others this writer included look at their tech investments by cost per usage.

If you look at the studies and your own habits you pick up your phone anywhere between 150-300 times a day (some peg it at 2000!) and the heavy use of what is undeniably your primary consumer electronic device can assuage some of the guilt induced by the big spend. Some quick math: If you pick up your ₹70000 phone 200 times a day 365 days a year you are spending less than a rupee for each interaction a figure that becomes even more favourable if you use the phone longer than a year.

Status: The most intangible factor yet likely why people consider premium flagships—the line of reasoning that falls somewhere in between “I want the best” and “I can afford it” or as you may recognise its more flamboyant avatar the “party flex”. Foldables are a great example visually distinct from their candy bar cousins and a great conversation starter. One man told me that a relative would buy the latest flagship to bolster her image as a “medical professional with the knack for the latest tech” one whose “medical equipment would be up to date like her phone”. Guess which phone she’s carrying these days? A Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3.

Wanting the “best” could also be about brand affinity and ecosystem preference whom you trust your data with or simply the exclusivity that comes with high-cost items.

You can see she shared the same photo of Salima's look in 'Jodha-Akbar' in her Instagram story. On the other hand she wrote in the caption 'This news is very heartbreaking. RIP Manisha Mannu.' Let me tell you all that the cause of Manisha's demise is yet to be revealed. Some media reports have revealed that he had suffered a brain haemorrhage which led to her succumbing to her injuries.

On the other hand Paridhi Sharma speaking to a website said ""I was not in constant touch with her after our show went off the air. But we have a WhatsApp group called Mughal and all the actresses in this group who were begums on the show. Through this group we are in touch and if anyone has to share something important about ourselves we used to do it on the group. Yesterday I came to know about this news through this group and I was shocked.''

Manisha Yadav shared her son's birthday photos on the Twitter handle. Manisha Yadav wrote at that time 'Happy first birthday my children. You've been like a light during the difficult times in my life. I feel blessed to be your mamma. I love you so much.'

We stock up on protein-packed foods like chicken breasts canned chickpeas and peanut butter.

I also like to buy frozen cherries monk-fruit sweetener canned black beans and sweet potatoes.

I have four active kids and a busy career as a health writer and personal trainer so it's no surprise my Costco cart is mostly filled with healthy food.

I work out and attend jiu-jitsu and kickboxing six days a week with my oldest child. My husband also lifts weights and brings his lunches to work every day. Our brood needs a lot of fuel and we love the wholesale retailer's bulk produce proteins grains and other food-prep staples.

We visit the store once every two weeks on average. Here are 21 things I always buy at Costco:

Cottage cheese is versatile and high in protein

Cottage cheese works for sweet and savory dishes. Rachel MacPherson

For a snack we top cottage cheese with fruit and nuts or cucumbers salt and pepper. It's also fantastic blended into a shake for a filling cheesecake-flavored beverage.

I also often add cottage cheese to my eggs for a creamy protein boost. It's tasty folded into an omelet or scrambled into eggs.

Chicken breasts are a no-brainer if you're trying to increase your protein intake

We eat chicken multiple times per week. Rachel MacPherson

We eat chicken breasts two to three times a week in everything from enchiladas to lemon-chicken soup.

I usually shred some of the chicken by putting two to three breasts in a pot and then poaching them.

Shredded chicken makes for an easy lunch when combined with mayo greek yogurt dijon and seasonings. We eat this with crackers and cucumber slices in a lettuce-leaf wrap on top of a garden salad or in a sandwich.

I also take leftover side salads from the previous night's dinner and turn them into a protein-packed lunch by adding shredded chicken breast nuts and cheese.

A little bit of kimchi goes a long way so the giant Hankook jar from Costco lasts us a while

Kimchi is tasty in fried rice. Rachel MacPherson

Kimchi is a probiotic food that is spicy highly flavorful and good for gut health.

We use it to make a lot of Asian-inspired meals like bibimbap a rice-based dish topped with fresh vegetables seasoned meat fried egg and kimchi. Sometimes we add this to leftover rice to create kimchi fried rice — a popular lunch for my kids.

Egg whites are very useful to have on hand

Whole eggs are nutritious and packed with nutrients. We eat the yolks too but the whites are a big help when trying to eat high-protein.

They're almost pure protein and it's easy to add them to things like oatmeal omelets and scrambles or make a lighter version of French toast or pancakes without potentially wasting yolks.

Whole eggs are a cheap source of protein that we eat every day

I stock up on eggs every time I go to Costco. Rachel MacPherson

We buy at least two flats of 30 eggs each time we visit Costco.

I stick a dozen eggs in my pressure cooker each week to have on hand for snacks. My husband and kids love hard-boiled eggs with a sprinkle of salt and pepper as a snack. I tend to get a bit fancier and add Greek yogurt mayo and sriracha to mine.

We also add fried eggs to Korean-inspired dishes or scramble them into fried rice. One of my kids loves to make a simple egg-drop soup or Greek avgolemono a quick-to-make lemon and chicken soup thickened with eggs.

Whole-grain tortillas are more versatile than bread in our house

Whole-grain tortillas are the base of some of our go-to meals. Rachel MacPherson

We use whole-grain tortillas to make wraps with egg or chicken salad. I also make homemade enchiladas for dinner which makes a lot of delicious leftovers that heat up nicely.

We also regularly make the TikTok-famous folded tortilla with a variety of fillings like shredded chicken salsa and black beans to create breakfasts and lunches. We either make them on the stovetop or in our air fryer.

We eat a lot of zucchini

Zucchini is versatile and we use it for meals and sometimes desserts. Rachel MacPherson

As I mentioned we shred zucchini and add it to oatmeal. I also love to sautee it as a base for shredded chicken basil fresh mozzarella and marinara sauce for a quick lunch.

Zucchini is also great as a replacement for pasta even though we don't eat low carb. Zucchini is packed full of nutrients and has a much lower calorie count than pasta which sometimes feels too heavy. Mixing zucchini noodles with regular whole-wheat or bean-based pasta adds more veggies and nutrients to our meals.

Sometimes we also shred zucchini into muffins pancakes and brownies for moisture and bulk.

Top sirloin steak is great in salads and other dishes

Cooked cold top sirloin pairs well with salads and eggs. Rachel MacPherson

I think Costco has great-quality meats with excellent prices.

We love steak at our house and usually stick to the leaner cuts. Top sirloin is delicious and cooks fast. We use it to make steakhouse-style salads with blue cheese or marinate it for bibimbap or bulgogi grilled pieces of thinly-sliced meat.

Cold leftover steak is also a nice salad topper or side for scrambled eggs.

A protein powerhouse Greek yogurt is an everyday food at our house

I use Greek yogurt to make sauces. Rachel MacPherson

We eat Greek yogurt with fresh fruit and use it as a base for protein pudding with avocado and protein powder blended into it.

I most frequently use Greek yogurt to make sauces. In any sauce that typically uses mayo I cut it with Greek yogurt to reduce the fat and increase the protein content.

For example I use it in sriracha mayo or a spicy Asian-inspired sauce as a base for chicken or egg salad and in homemade salad dressing for a creamy texture.

Steel-cut oats are a breakfast staple

At least one of us tends to eat oats for breakfast every day.

Bob's Red Mill makes a quick-cooking version of steel-cut oats that offers the chewy savory texture and taste that we love but also can be cooked in minutes in the microwave.

Related stories

My kids love to add frozen berries cocoa powder or chocolate protein powder and milk their oats. My husband and I add shredded zucchini egg whites almond milk frozen fruit and protein powder.

I also grind oats into flour to use for making baked goods homemade protein pancake mix and healthy mug cakes.

Kefir is good for smoothies shakes and dressings

We use kefir in smoothies sometimes. Rachel MacPherson

My local Costco carries a large jug of drinkable Good Moood Farm kefir a tangy probiotic beverage that contains more healthy bacteria than yogurt and is good for gut health.

Advertisement

We add this to smoothies and protein shakes. It's also great for making gut-friendly salad dressings like ranch and Caesar.

We use mixed baby greens for salads and sandwiches

Mixed greens are a great salad base. Rachel MacPherson

I make easy lunches in no time by throwing mixed greens in a bowl and topping them with leftover meat boiled eggs chickpeas or black beans nuts cheese and dressing.

Kirkland natural peanut butter is delicious and well-priced

Sometimes a spoonful of this peanut butter is the perfect snack. Rachel MacPherson

We always have peanut butter on hand to put on oatmeal waffles and toast or to mix into smoothies and yogurt.

Peanut butter is an easy way to get in some healthy mono- and poly-unsaturated fats and protein. My middle boy is quite small so he drinks protein shakes with plenty of high-calorie peanut butter to help him grow.

Plus there's not much a spoonful of peanut butter can't cure.

A staple carb sweet potatoes are a nutritious vegetable that we use in many ways

Roasted sweet potatoes are a nice salad topping. Rachel MacPherson

Sweet potatoes are also excellent cooked in bulk in the pressure cooker and used throughout the week as the starchy carb part of our meals. And air-fryer sweet-potato fries are incredible.

I eat them for breakfast with savory toppings like scrambled eggs salsa and black beans or with sweet ones like Greek yogurt sauteed apples cinnamon and peanut butter.

Leftover roasted sweet potatoes make an excellent salad topping and work well as a side dish with eggs for breakfast.

Advertisement

They are even good whipped into a dessert or baked into brownies. I also like to thinly slice sweet potatoes and put them in the toaster to turn them into a bread substitute.

Garden Fresh's salsa is a quick tasty topping for so many dishes

Salsa is a great dip to have on hand. Rachel MacPherson

The Garden Fresh salsa tastes more vibrant and refreshing to us than others we've tried.

We add salsa to eggs baked potatoes wraps quesadillas enchiladas homemade nachos and more.

The salsa also pairs well with the Kirkland-brand tortilla chips which we buy on occasion.

Advertisement

Grape tomatoes are great for snacks and recipes

Grape tomatoes are great for making salad in a jar. Rachel MacPherson

Grape tomatoes are perfect for meal prep and leftovers because they are self-contained and don't leak juice that can make pre-prepared foods soggy.

They are also excellent for making jar salads since I can place them in the bottom of the jar with dressing to marinate. They also create a barrier for the dressing so the rest of the salad ingredients don't get soggy.

I also back grape tomatoes with baby carrots and cucumber slices in my kids' lunches as a snack.

A healthy source of fiber carbs and protein black beans appear regularly in our meals

We use black beans in our Mexican-inspired meals. Rachel MacPherson

We add black beans to Mexican-inspired egg dishes salads and soups.

Advertisement

My family's favorite light brownie recipe also uses black beans as a secret ingredient. They're always a hit with the kids at school potlucks.

I buy both canned and dried chickpeas from Costco

Chickpeas are good for soups and salads. Rachel MacPherson

Chickpea salad is one of my favorite side dishes and I also love to make homemade hummus for school and work snacks.

When I buy dried chickpeas I prepare them in my pressure cooker and freeze them. When they thaw I can use them for hummus and dips (both sweet and savory including edible cookie dough) or for making peanut-butter chickpea blondies.

Canned chickpeas are also excellent to have on hand for last-minute additions to salads or soups.

Advertisement

I love having frozen broccoli on hand

Frozen broccoli is a freezer staple for us. Rachel MacPherson

Whenever we are making a quick weeknight dinner but forgot a green vegetable frozen broccoli comes to the rescue.

It's quick to make in the microwave and we season it with lemon garlic powder salt and pepper. It's also perfect as a quick side for meal prep.

I use monk-fruit sweetener for my healthier baked goods

Monk-fruit sweetener can switch up the taste of baked goods. Rachel MacPherson

I use monk-fruit sweetener for black-bean brownies chickpea blondies muffins and mug cakes.

Sometimes I replace all of the sugar in a recipe with monk-fruit sweetener but more often I just do half since the ingredient can have a cooling mint-like effect or alter the expected taste of some dishes.

Advertisement

I buy a variety of frozen fruit from Costco but always make sure we have cherries on hand

We like to add cherries to our oatmeal. Rachel MacPherson

Cherries are the most common addition to our morning oatmeal and they're also a delicious ingredient in chocolate protein smoothies.

For my kids I add frozen cherries on top of vanilla yogurt in a cup or jar with a screw top. By the time they eat it for lunch or snack the cherries have thawed and the juice combines with the yogurt making a sweet and delicious treat.

We also do this with mangoes blueberries and mixed berries we buy at Costco.

So glad I actually looked! moments: You get home from the grocery store and crack open a fresh item… only to find out it's maybe not so fresh after all. On Friday after one Costco fan took to social media to share this exact experience they learned that they're definitely not the only one who's encountered a food safety concern with this particular Kirkland Signature product.

Check out the Costco item that's causing members to screw the lid back on STAT. Also don't miss McDonald's and Other Chains Are Closing Dining Rooms Again Amid the New Vaccine Mandate.

Hopefully the ""Organic"" just means there are no preservatives inside..?

Friday morning u/jim27kj shared on Reddit: ""Kirkland signature organic strawberry spread moldy [sic].""

From here dialogue began about the organic strawberry spread which this shopper said they purchased at a Costco in Tukwila Washington. As the conversation continued it seemed this was not an isolated incident…

For daily grocery news you can use sign up for the Eat This Not That! newsletter.

""It was for sure sealed?""

That was u/pennylick's question who pointed out that the growth might also resemble yeast. (Still perhaps not entirely settling even if that were the case.)6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

However the original poster stuck with their observation suggesting this had to be mold. ""Yes freshly opened"" they responded. ""I happened to buy two jars the same day as my family tears through these. Both are moldy I can see the other one is and it is still factory sealed. Best by date of 11/01/2022 20:52 TR [sic].""

One Major Effect of Eating Strawberries Says Science

Several others voiced the same sticky issue.

About this same strawberry spread u/miggitymikeb offered ""I had to quit buying this stuff because of mold also. It would get moldy in the fridge after just a month or two.""

U/dbox44 said the same: ""I bought some of this and it had the same thing after only about 2 months in the fridge (maybe I'm crazy but I thought this would last a lot longer) [sic].""

Of the respondents U/Intrepid_East9652 observed the shortest shelf life of all: ""This was one of the most perishable items I've ever purchased from Costco that wasn't produce. It definitely shouldn't be like that opening up but mine went bad a little over a week stored in the fridge.""

This Grocery Chain's Produce Is Falling Out of Favor With Customers

""Glad it isn't just me.""

U/CannedBread707 chimed in saying ""Glad it isn't just me. Delicious but I'm not an entire family of 12. I can't finish it before it starts growing legs.""

One Major Side Effect of Eating From a To-Go Container According to Experts

The not-so-sweet outcome.

As the weekend starts it doesn't sound like the original poster will get to enjoy that Kirkland Signature strawberry goodness right away—they signed off with: ""I'll definitely be taking [it] back.""

Many Costco shoppers were excited about the find which will add a country-chic touch to any home thanks to the mango wood and burnished iron accent bands.

Yet despite its seemingly vast selection of beloved items (like peanut butter and wine) the brand's water has become a big topic of concern among members.

Earlier this year the chain experienced shortages of water that resulted in product limits and was allowing members to buy no more than five cases of any line of water. Months later Kirkland water has still been difficult to find due to high demand and when it is it's more expensive.

Related: Costco Is Discontinuing This Beloved Spice

""Has anyone else noticed that the price for the 40 count went up from $2.99 to $3.19?"" one Reddit user and Costco shopper asked about the Kirkland brand pack of water bottles on the social media platform recently. While noting the cost for bottled water the user added that they wanted to understand the reasoning behind the sudden price increase.

One response to the post blamed inflation for the rising costs of water. Costco CFO Richard Galanti recently discussed this and the issue of shipping delays that have backed up water and other items in a Quarter 4 earnings call. The problems pushed Costco to rent three shipping vessels to help complete deliveries on time he said.

But the short supply and price hike are not the only challenges that Costco shoppers are currently facing when it comes to this item.

Another Reddit user @Liquidretro recently detailed an unpleasant effect of purchasing a case of Kirkland water describing the water as having a smell like ""fish tank water or lake water."" The user even reported the issue to the manufacturer.

Another Reddit user from the same thread agreed and commented that they also noticed the smell. ""I have often bought their bottled water so I know [it] doesn't usually taste that way"" they said.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Eat This Not That! has reached out to Costco for a statement on the Kirkland brand's water issues but has not yet received a response.

Filming for series 5 of The Crown is underway and new pictures show a recreation of the famous 1992 fire that tore through Windsor Castle.

Filmed at Burghley House near Stamford Lincolnshire this week incredibly realistic ‘flames’ and smoke blazed from the building.

The original fire occurred on November 20 1992 after a faulty spotlight set alight a curtain next to the altar in Queen Victoria’s private chapel.

The fire was spotted at 11:30pm and burned for 15 hours destroying 115 rooms including nine State Rooms.

After just three hours 225 firefighters had been recruited from seven countries to put out the flames resulting in 1.5million gallons of water being used.

The Queen was not staying at Windsor at the time of the fire but she arrived shortly after the blaze began.

New pictures show the building in flames SplashNews.com)

Once the fire had been extinguished there was a huge restoration task ahead with some rooms being restored to their traditional appearance while others were given a more modern interpretation.

Season five of The Crown will see Harry Potter star Imelda Staunton take over as the monarch filling the shoes of Olivia Colman who scored an Emmy for her portrayal of the Queen.

Imelda 65 was also photographed on set of the devastating blaze spotted arriving in a Range Rover.

With just two seasons of the much-loved show remaining it is uncertain what storylines they will tackle.

However it is believed the drama will continue to focus on the breakdown of Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s marriage.

Dominic West 51 will play the Prince of Wales while Elizabeth Debicki 31 has replaced Golden Globe winner Emma Corrin as Diana.

The drama might also focus on the separation of Prince Andrew from Sarah Ferguson and Princess Anne’s divorce from Mark Phillips which all took place in 1992.

Series five of The Crown will be released on Netflix in November 2022.

His cropped hair chic glasses and confident swagger were on point.

“He nailed it” she said. “He was so cute.”

These days she travels to Europe to watch him walk the runways of some of the world’s most renowned fashion houses.

As a student at St. Petersburg High School Rodda used to embellish some of his outfits with patches. But those trimmings were no match for the silk overcoats sleeveless button-down shirts and leather lace-up boots he has been donning for designers like Saint Laurent and Celine since he graduated in 2018.

Rodda 21 doesn’t remember when he first decided he wanted to be a model. He posed for head shots in high school and “definitely paid attention to what I was wearing.”

His mom though knew what it would take to launch her son’s career having herself walked the runways in New York City in the 1980s with supermodels like Cindy Crawford and Stephanie Seymour.

As he matured Cummins could tell her 6-foot-3-inch son had a unique appearance alluring to luxury designers. “He doesn’t have a classic Calvin Klein all-American look” she said.

She said they tried modeling in New York but Rodda hadn’t yet developed a look that appealed to the agencies. Cummins describes his look as “more androgynous like if Tilda Swinton and David Bowie had a baby.”

On her advice he found an agent in Europe and is represented by Tomorrow Is Another Day a firm headquartered in Cologne Germany.

Rodda initially contracted to model exclusively for luxury designer Celine. He did three major shows until 2020 when the pandemic halted fashion events worldwide. He came home to St. Petersburg and worked as a parking valet until his $2000-a-show (plus room and board) career could be rebooted.

Earlier this year he signed with Saint Laurent and spent a month in Paris so the designers could use him as a “fit model” to create the clothes he would model in Venice in July.

Saint Laurent commissioned an artist to create a giant mirrored pavilion on the Venice island of Isola Della Certosa to introduce the men’s 2022 spring and summer collection. The looks Rodda modeled included an all-black ensemble with a long black coat and a black velvet suit with flared pants.

“I think that Celine and Saint Laurent clothes look the best on me with the black jeans and kind of a rock star style” Rodda said.

His plan was to head back to Europe this fall to audition for more of the 2022 runway shows.

“There’s definitely more work for me in Europe” he said. He wants to model for some of his favorite designers in the future including Rick Owens and Raf Simons.

“I think they are very unique and they’re not too mainstream” Rodda said. “I think their clothes are interesting and they have a certain swag about them.”

The most unusual outfit he recalled modeling was a striking leopard print overcoat he wore for a Celine show. “It was crazy” he said adding that his personal style is much simpler.

“I usually wear my trusty Adidas pants with zippers on the pockets and a hoodie or something” he said.

“He looks good in everything he wears” said Cummins. When he lands his next runway job she hopes to be sitting in the audience to cheer him on.

The new clip showcases a number of this year’s male and female suitors in what’s said to be a history-making season but there’s one contestant in particular that may surprise viewers.

As well as a bearded man arriving on a lawnmower a woman in a red gown and a gentleman in a tan suit a brunette woman in a white dress is shown arriving on the red carpet ready to fight for Brooke's heart.

Eagle-eyed fans would recognise her as Jamie-Lee Dayz who was an intruder on Nick ‘The Honey Badger’ Cummins’ season of The Bachelor in 2018.

The 30-year-old bisexual woman appeared alongside Brooke in season six - where she unfortunately had to use crutches for the majority of the show after a group date injury - and made it all the way to the top eight.

Her appearance on The Bachelorette will definitely be interesting as she and Brooke were rumoured to have developed a romance in the mansion.

“I have a lot of love for Brooke and she’s such a legend but we’re definitely just friends” she told Mamamia after her elimination.

Brooke echoed her sentiments in an interview with OK! Magazine saying that they had a “great friendship” but there was “definitely no sexual relationship there”.

In addition to the first glimpse at the participants the new trailer shows Brooke getting ready for her red carpet debut in a sparkling black-gloved dress while she opens up about her feelings.

“Being the Bachelorette I get teary I get emotional I get goosebumps” she says. “Because I’m the first Indigenous bisexual Bachelorette. The barriers that have been broken just by doing this I think is huge.”

The 26-year-old goes on to recount her first experience on the dating show where she made it to the final four.

“I first came into the mansion in Nick Cummins’ season of The Bachelor and genuinely thought that I was going to be the girl at the end” she recalls. “But it didn’t work out.”

Fans would also remember Brooke’s brief appearance on season two of Bachelor In Paradise where she was left heartbroken when Alex Nation chose Bill Goldsmith over her.

“I gave it another shot in Paradise” she says. “I am just a girl trying to fall in love.

“It’s not about gender it’s always about connection. A partner that is on the same team as me that’s what I want. I just want to find my person.”

The video ends after Brooke slow dances with a blonde woman and tells the cameras while blushing: “I am mind-blown. Let's just pack it up. We're done!”

The New Zealand pacer came into the KKR side in place of Pat Cummins

Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) took a huge step towards making it to the playoffs with a win over Surisers Hyderabad (SRH) on Sunday (October 3) in Dubai. New Zealand pacer Tim Southee who came into the second leg of the Indian Premier League (IPL 2021) after Pat Cummins pulled out impressed with the ball against SRH finishing with 2 for 26.

With the likes of Lockie Ferguson Andre Russell out due to injuries KKR captain Eoin Morgan praised Southee for the contribution he has made to the team. ""Tim's obviously had a huge impact on the side"" Morgan said in the press conference after his team's win over SRH.

""When you miss two or three big gun players - we miss Pat we miss Lockie and obviously Dre has been missing as well. His contribution with the ball in this phase has been brilliant.""

It's one thing contributing throughout a campaign but I think when you look at actually when you need players to stand up senior players to be able to do that... Tim has done that brilliantly.""

""He's come in seamlessly showing a lot of experience. He's done it for a very long time for the Blackcaps. He's obviously one of their top-class bowlers in all formats of the game so it is great to see that in a KKR shirt"" he added.

Sometimes the answer to a problem can be staring you right in the face.

At least that's what Hawke's Bay shearer Jovian Cummins found while knee deep in Merino wool.

Cummins 25 has come up with a bright business idea to make Merino-wool jeans specifically for shearers and farmers called Woolies Jeans as opposed to traditional cotton jeans.

""I got fed up with wearing hot sweaty work pants all day"" he said about his experience working in shearing sheds across the globe.

""I thought how could I solve the problem and the answer was staring at me in the face every day - it was wool.

""If it works the same for sheep keeping them cool in hot environments and warm in cold environments it should work for me.""

The former Havelock North High School student has teamed up with two old high school mates Isaac Williams and Felix Watkins to launch the business.

On Monday the trio released a crowdfunding campaign to financially kickstart Woolies Jeans.

They are aiming to raise up to $500000 which will allow them to manufacture and sell the product online. They also hope to set up a base in Hawke's Bay in the future.

""We are planning on releasing hopefully by next winter mainly online and grow from there"" he said.

""We will start with the New Zealand market and I think Australia will follow suit. There is a huge market out there throughout the world.""

He said during the early prototypes he received help from his mum Jenifer Cummins who is a teacher in Havelock North but has a background in fashion design.

Jovian Cummins has since teamed up with a designer in Auckland to make the product market ready.

He said he had received good feedback from friends who had worn the first pairs of Woolies Jeans including a farmer working in extremely rough conditions.

""He took them out in the snow and said they were awesome.""

A pair of Woolies will likely set you back about $250 when they go to market.

""I think that is quite reasonable.""

He said if you walk into farming shops and look around you can find quality work pants for that price or even more expensive.

He said it would benefit more than just farmers and shearers including a range of people such as hikers and hunters.

Cummins said people can invest a minimum of $250."

Wolves’ Hwang Hee-chan celebrates his first goal against Newcastle. (Nick Potts/PA) (PA Wire)

Hwang Hee-chan’s brace inspired Wolves and sunk winless Newcastle to pile the pressure on Magpies boss Steve Bruce.

The striker scored Wolves’ first home goals in the Premier League this season as Bruno Lage’s improving side bagged a 2-1 win.

Jeff Hendrick’s first-half leveller briefly threatened to upset the hosts’ momentum but they have now won three of their last four top flight games which threaten to ignite their season.

It was not a classic performance but it was good enough to beat the Magpies who are still searching for their first win of the season and slipped to second bottom.

Bruce would have left frustrated after a tight game yet there was little suggestion Newcastle will avoid a relegation battle this term.

They began brightly enough with Allan Saint-Maximin the focal point but fell behind to the game’s first chance after 20 minutes.

It was more evidence Raul Jimenez’s powers are returning after his fractured skull when fresh from his first goal in 336 days to beat Southampton last week he turned provider at Molineux.

The striker brilliantly held off Sean Longstaff and slipped in Hwang to draw Karl Darlow and slide a low shot under the goalkeeper.

The confidence drained from the Magpies while Wolves looking for successive wins for just the third time this year grew and Joao Moutinho tested Darlow from distance.

There was though a lack of flow to the game which continued to be punctuated with breaks for treatment and Joe Willock was eventually forced off nine minutes before half time and replaced by Hendrick.

Chances were rare but Wolves should have doubled their lead when Francisco Trincao blew a golden opening.

Ruben Neves found Hwang and his cross reached Trincao but the forward smashed a thundering effort off the underside of the bar.

It was a wretched miss and Wolves paid the price 73 seconds later when the Magpies levelled after 41 minutes.

Joelinton raced onto Saint-Maximin’s pass and Jose Sa injured himself diving at his feet.

The ball ran loose and Neves lost possession on the edge of the area for Javier Manquillo to find Hendrick and with Sa struggling to regain his position the substitute drilled into the corner from 25 yards.

Wolves were furious and boss Lage was booked while a bottle appeared to be thrown onto the pitch from the home fans in the aftermath but there was little wrong with the goal.

Emboldened Newcastle went for another after the restart and Sa needed to be alert to block Saint-Maximin’s close-range effort following Joelinton’s cross.

But Wolves regrouped and restored their lead when Jimenez and Hwang and combined again for the winner after 58 minutes.

Jimenez showed excellent skill and strength to turn Longstaff and ride a challenge from Isaac Hayden to feed Hwang and the South Korea international produced another excellent low finish.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vbG9zc3ByZXZlbnRpb25tZWRpYS5jb20vbHAtcGVvcGxlLW9uLXRoZS1tb3ZlLXNlcHRlbWJlci0yMDIxL9IBS2h0dHBzOi8vbG9zc3ByZXZlbnRpb25tZWRpYS5jb20vbHAtcGVvcGxlLW9uLXRoZS1tb3ZlLXNlcHRlbWJlci0yMDIxLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LP People on the Move: September 2021,"September is back-to-school time for students and an opportunity for new growth for those heading off to experience the exciting adventures of college life for the first time.

After facing some compromising positions in the first round O’Neill (8-0 MMA 3-0 UFC) rallied in a big way in the second round of her women’s flyweight fight with Shevchenko (9-4 MMA 3-4 UFC) at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas.

The 23-year-old O’Neill stayed unbeaten in her young career by getting into full mount on Shevchenko and pounding away with strikes until the fight was mercifully stopped at the 4:47 mark of Round 2.

Check out the highlights of O’Neill’s handiwork below (via Twitter):

Australia’s O’Neill is off to a hot start in the octagon and said her victory over Shevchenko proved she can compete with the elite at 125 pounds.

“I felt good” O’Neill said in her post-fight interview with Daniel Cormier. “I say time and time again just because I don’t have the opportunity to fight people like this doesn’t mean I’m not capable of that. … I’m for real and I hope I showed that to everyone tonight.”

The 22 handicapper who plays left-handed and putts right-handed out of JP McManus’ Adare Manor partnered Belfast’s Michael Hoey to victory in the Pro-Am as they carded rounds of 62 at Kingsbarns 67 at St Andrews and 63 at Carnoustie before closing with a 12-under par 60 on the Old Course.

For Danaher the sweetest part about the win was that she beat her husband Gerry McManus who had also qualified for the Championship’s final day in partnership with Shane Lowry.

Gerry brother of JP and his fellow Irishman Lowry finished in equal fifth place with a four-round team score of 32-under-par and Danaher said: “Gerry and I had a little bet on the first day to see who could get the best score so I’ve won that. And that’s really pleasing!”

She and Hoey won on the break of a tie — their lower score at St Andrews earlier in the week — from Australian cricket legend Shane Warne and his partner the New Zealander Ryan Fox on 36-under par meaning a much-needed cash windfall for Hoey.

“Maeve was brilliant to play with” said Hoey who won €85469 — €43120 for leading home the winning Pro-Am team as well as €42349 for finishing tied 24th in the tournament proper.

“She was great company. She came in dovetailed well. Got lucky really came into the right holes both of us.”

Hoey crucially birdied the 18th from four feet for a closing 69 saw his score improve by nine strokes by his amateur partner as they made eight birdies and three eagles in their 60.",,,,,,,,,

Spears posted a workout video on her Instagram page on Friday staying fit alongside her fiancé Sam Asghari.

In the video Spears is wearing a hot-pink sports bra layered with a white see-through blouse blue and white shorts and baby pink and white sneakers. The sneakers look similar to footwear brand Hoka One One from which Spears has often been seen wearing Hoka One One Clifton 3 sneakers over the past few years.

More from Footwear News

Hoka One One was co-founded by Nicolas Mermoud and Jean-Luc Diard in 2009 and has since become one of the most popular athletic footwear brands amongst the celebrity crowd. Stars ranging from Reese Witherspoon to Pippe Middleton and even Kanye West have been seen repping sneakers from this brand. Hoka One One is known for their state-of-the-art carbon-plate technology and their oversized soles. In 2013 the brand was acquired by Deckers Brands which is also the parent company of brands like Ugg Sanuk and Teva.

When Spears is not wearing workout gear she can often be seen wearing more girly options like high-heeled stilettos or Go-Go boots. Whether she’s dressed up in pumps or more casual with a pair of sneakers we love seeing Spears in all her various styles.

Surging shopper demand coupled with shipping container shortages and bottlenecks at ports have already triggered tighter supply of products from cars to shoes.

In particular some of America’s biggest sellers of clothing and shoes cite one catalyst that has compounded the pressure: factory closures in Vietnam stemming from a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak there. That’s led brands from PacSun to Nike to warn about the effects on their supply.

In late September Nike (NKE) cut its full-year sales outlook due to supply chain issues despite its CEO noting strong consumer demand.

Nike makes about three-quarters of its shoes in Southeast Asia with 51% and 24% of manufacturing in Vietnam and Indonesia respectively.

But as the Vietnam government imposed pandemic-related restrictions including a mandatory shutdown of factories for several weeks from July into September Nike said it incurred 10 weeks of lost production.

Even when factories start to reopen which the company expects to happen in phases beginning in October ramping up to full production could take several months Nike’s chief financial officer Matthew Friend said in a recent earnings call. Half of Nike’s clothing factories in Vietnam are currently closed company executives said during that call.

Vietnam accounts for a third of sports brand Under Armour (UA)’s footwear and clothing production. Under Armour (UA)’s CEO Patrik Frisk said during its most recent earnings call in August that it was closely monitoring impact of factory shutdowns there on its supply chain there calling it a “developing situation.”

Ugg Coach and Michael Kors have exposure

Vietnam is a crucial supplier to the US in particular for apparel and footwear.

“It’s a very big partner of the United States. It’s our second largest source of apparel and footwear” said Steve Lamar president and CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association an industry group. China is the largest supplier of clothing and shoes according to the AAFA.

In July Vietnam was caught in the throes of a coronavirus outbreak caused by a suspected new variant of the virus which Vietnam’s health minister said led to a fast spread of new infections in the nation’s industrial zones.

The government subsequently imposed strict lockdowns and temporarily shut factories there until mid-August then extended it into September. Some factories are still closed.

All of this means that production for everything from sneakers and sandals to jeans dresses T-shirts jackets and more is stalled.

In a research note last month BITG analyst Camilo Lyon said athletic footwear brands such as Nike and Adidas are most at risk of having serious supply chain disruptions because “Vietnam has served as a strong manufacturing alternative to China in recent years.”

Other brands that have significant manufacturing exposure to Vietnam he said include Ugg maker Deckers Outdoor (DECK) Columbia Sportswear Coach parent Tapestry (TPR) and Capri Holdings (which owns the Michael Kors brand).

Lyon estimates it may take five to six months for factories in Vietnam to be back up and running normally when the lockdown ends. And whenever they do come back on line he anticipates another issue: staffing.

“Vietnamese factories will also likely have trouble getting workers to come back to work post-lockdown” he said.

Teen retailer PacSun is expecting an impact to the holiday season.

Brieane Olson president of PacSun said in an interview in August with CNNBusiness that about 10% of its goods are sourced from Vietnam.

Olson said the retailer was already dealing with a two-to-four week delay for its back-to-school inventory this year because of the ongoing global supply chain delays.

Now she said new products for the winter and holiday season is likely to also face another four-week delay she said making it a challenge to get new fashions and styles in jeans tops sweaters and sweatshirts into stores in a timely manner.

And there’s an additional effect on the consumer Olson said: Having less product means the retailer will pull back on discounts “because there is no need for it” she said.",,,,,,,,,
DE,John Deere,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGxpbmdzdG9uZS5jb20vbXVzaWMvbXVzaWMtZmVhdHVyZXMvcmljay1yb3NzLWxhd25tb3dpbmctYm9zcy0xMjI3MTY3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rick Ross... Luxurious Landscaper?!,"My Obsession is a regular column in which our favorite musicians show off their nonmusical passions.



Rick Ross is a man of simple pleasures. He enjoys a fast car a well-rolled blunt and the clean look of his own freshly mowed lawn. “It’s something I look forward to” Ross says outfitted with a big white cowboy hat and a shiny chain as he sits between two large bottles of champagne. “I have my windows tinted. No one knows it’s Ricky Rozay the biggest boss. AC’s down to 68 degrees and I’m cutting. I’m looking for anything on the lawn that’s standing out or looking obnoxious.”

Ross bought an industrial-size John Deere lawn tractor last year to help clear out 280 acres surrounding his estate just north of Atlanta — a property so expansive that he rented it out to serve as the fictional palace of Zamunda in Coming 2 America. Mowing the lawn is a whole-day commitment taking between six and eight hours each time (and saving himself an estimated seven figures in lawncare costs).

On most days Ross remains busy with other pursuits befitting a rap mogul whether it’s readying new album Richer Than I Ever Been writing the new book The Perfect Day to Boss Up: A Hustler’s Guide to Building Your Empire or doing his diligence as a Wingstop franchise owner by helping the chain promote its Thighstop campaign earlier this summer. He sees his lawn-mowing shifts as a meditative break from that daily grind. “When I’m in a tractor I’m sitting seven feet in the sky surrounded by nothing but peace: trees deers bucks” he says. “I’m thinking about my children my investments my next moves on records. Every hundred yards I’m seeing something I never noticed before. I’m smoking the best cannabis. It’s a beautiful event.” Editor’s picks

Mowing the lawn plays into Ross’s greater ethos of being active in every part of his empire and taking pleasure in the everyday. “To me that defines a boss remaining hands-on” he says. “Let’s do it. But cutting grass is just as fun to me as riding an ATV. And I got a fucking warehouse full of ATVs. So you can only imagine how much I love riding ATVs or playing with my dogs or feeding apples to my horses.”

Ross enjoys the cowboy aesthetic he’s taken on tending to his range. Asked for advice on how to pull off wearing a cowboy hat he confidently responds: “As you step out of the bed and you put your feet down on the towel you just got to tell yourself you’re the biggest fucking boss. You can put on the ugliest hat you want to and still be beautiful because I’m a beautiful motherfucker.”

Cutting grass happened to be an early job for Ross as a young kid in Carol City Florida a memory that he often reflects on as he tends to his own gigantic yard. “In my Black community you made paper if you had a successful landscaping company” he says. “I knocked on your mom’s door and told her if she had $5 I’d cut the grass in the front — just not the back because I was afraid of snakes. If I had to cut every yard on the block to put some money in my pocket I’m with it. I’m still that same dude. That’s why I’m still doing it.”

While lawn-cutting is more of a hobby than a job for Ross he remains committed to quality cutting the grass in careful angles and patterns. “I want my shit looking like a golf course” he says. “When I find a great pattern I cut it that way four or five times in a row. I just want to try different things because growing up you just cut the grass straight across. Here I have spots that go up and down along hills and I love the way it looks when you ride along the hill. When the groove goes along the hill it’s a beautiful situation. When I do that it’s like ‘Damn you couldn’t even pay for that.'” Trending 'Word Salad': Andrew Huberman's Cannabis Claims Slammed by Experts Brian Wilson Placed in Conservatorship as Daughters Win Consultation Rights Hear the Journey Tune Steve Perry Rerecorded With Steve Lukather's Son Meet the Voice Behind Randy Travis's New Song

At the time of our Zoom call Ross had yet to name his tractor. One fan online suggested “Morning Glory” calling back to a phrase he often says during Instagram Live sessions. “Whoo!” Ross shouts satisfied. “You need to contact that fan so I can ask for permission to name my tractor Morning Glory. Genius.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYW5jYXN0ZXJlYWdsZWdhemV0dGUuY29tL3BpY3R1cmUtZ2FsbGVyeS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjEvMTAvMDIvYmFocy1oZWxkLWl0cy1hbnRpcXVlLXRyYWN0b3Itc2hvdy1hbmQtcGFyYWRlLXNhdHVyZGF5LW9jdC0yLzU5NjY1NjcwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The BAHS' held its Antique Tractor Show and Parade Saturday Oct. 2,"LOCAL

Rick Ross can certainly afford to pay to get his lawn cut. Nevertheless according to a new profile by Rolling Stone cutting his own grass has become a household chore Rozay enjoys doing himself. The platinum-selling rapper told the music publication that a clean freshly mowed lawn is something he “looks forward to.” “I have my windows tinted. No one knows it’s Ricky Rozay the biggest boss. AC’s down to 68 degrees and I’m cutting. I’m looking for anything on the lawn that’s standing out or looking obnoxious” he said.

The feature which is titled “Rick Ross… Luxurious Landscaper?!” delves into the “Blowin’ Money Fast” rapper’s domestic life — specifically exploring his affinity for cutting grass. Ross reportedly purchased an industrial-size John Deere lawn tractor in 2020 to mow the grass covering his mammoth estate in Fayetteville Georgia. Rozay purchased the mansion which previously belonged to boxing champ Evander Holyfield in 2014 for $5.8 million according to Forbes.

For Ross cutting the grass on his property can take between six and eight hours. But it’s worth it for the Boss who calls his time atop a tractor “a beautiful event.” “When I’m in a tractor I’m sitting seven feet in the sky surrounded by nothing but peace: trees deers bucks” he said. “I’m thinking about my children my investments my next moves on records. Every hundred yards I’m seeing something I never noticed before. I’m smoking the best cannabis.”

Perhaps the peace Ross is referring to stems from his childhood when he used to cut grass to earn some extra cash in his Carol City Florida neighborhood. “In my Black community you made paper if you had a successful landscaping company” he recalled. “I knocked on your mom’s door and told her if she had $5 I’d cut the grass in the front just not the back because I was afraid of snakes. If I had to cut every yard on the block to put some money in my pocket I’m with it. I’m still that same dude. That’s why I’m still doing it.”

While Rolling Stone estimates Rozay saves nearly seven figures in landscaping costs it’s clear that mowing his own lawn is more than just a tactic to save money. Being involved in his empire and “remaining hands-on” he said “defines a boss.” “Cutting grass is just as fun to me as riding an ATV… I want my shit looking like a golf course.”"

Introducing new service to Athens Tel-Aviv Baltimore Denver and San Diego in summer 2022.

Welcoming new Airbus A321neos into Delta’s fleet with first flights out of Boston in spring 2022.

Offering more Delta flights from Boston than ever before – a +20% capacity increase from pre-pandemic height.

Five new routes and more modernized fuel-efficient aircraft are set to debut at Logan International Airport in 2022 as Boston’s No. 1 global airline continues building up a premier hub and international gateway.

“We’ve strengthened our Boston hub as demand has accelerated adding about 3800 more seats a day by next summer than our last peak in 2019” said Joe Esposito Delta’s S.V.P. – Network Planning. “Boston is a fast-growing market with a booming economy and we’re committed to offering customers significant choice and better convenience when making their travel plans in addition to Delta’s superior products and experience.”

By next summer in Boston Delta will operate up to 160 daily nonstop flights to 55 destinations a more than 20% increase in capacity since our pre-pandemic height in October 2019. Including Delta’s partners customers can connect to more than 150 cities across the globe.

“We are excited to welcome new Delta flights to Boston connecting visitors and travelers to exciting destinations around the world” said Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker. “These flights coming to Logan Airport in 2022 will allow more people to access hundreds of destinations and the global economy.”

New global destinations to explore

Beginning Memorial Day weekend Delta will launch new nonstop service to Tel Aviv (TLV) on May 26 and Athens (ATH) on May 27.

Both ATH and TLV will operate three times a week on the Airbus A330-300 and A330-900 respectively.

Each features personal seat-back entertainment screens to enjoy in flight and the J.D. Power-awarded care and professionalism of Delta people.

“Delta's fleet expansion at Logan is a big boost for economic development” said Rep. Jake Auchincloss. “Massachusetts is a powerhouse of talent -- and we are stronger when that talent has more connections to the wider world.""

New Athens and Tel Aviv service will complement Delta’s existing flights to Amsterdam and Rome and returning pre-COVID service to Dublin Edinburgh Lisbon London and Paris.

While Delta will also continue operating Boston-Cancun next summer customers can book this year’s warm winter escape with additional seasonal service to Aruba (AUA) Montego Bay (MBJ) Nassau (NAS) Punta Cana (PUJ) and St. Thomas (STT).

“As more and more travelers return to the skies Delta remains a strong partner for the Massachusetts airline market” said Massachusetts Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito. “We look forward to the positive impact these new flights will have in connecting the commonwealth to more global destinations.”

New flights to Boston’s top 20 markets

Starting July 11 Delta will serve each of Boston’s 20 most popular markets nonstop with the addition of Baltimore (BWI) and Denver (DEN) – as well as introduce new flights to San Diego (SAN).

Baltimore flights will operate five times a day on the Embraer 175** which offer 12 First Class 20 Comfort+ and 44 Main Cabin seats with full-sized overhead bins no middle seats and free Delta Studio content available for streaming on your device.

Both Denver and San Diego service will operate daily on the 180-seat Boeing 737-900 and 160-seat Boeing 737-800 respectively. Each will be equipped with Viasat-powered high-speed Wi-Fi* to deliver a reliable and streaming quality connection for everyone on board in addition to a wealth of premium seat-back entertainment options.

Delta is also launching new daily service to Charlotte and Dallas/Fort Worth on Oct. 10 delivering greater connectivity to major markets.

Fuel-efficiency and an elevated onboard experience

As part of our fleet renewal plans Delta will welcome the first Airbus A321neos into our fleet in spring 2022 with the first customer flights scheduled to depart out of Boston. Not only does the A321neo further elevate the customer experience but the aircraft supports our carbon neutrality commitment as our most fuel-efficient large gauge narrowbody – achieving 12% better fuel efficiency on a per-seat basis than its counterpart the A321ceo.

The 194-seat aircraft features thoughtful touches like a new First Class seat design to offer more privacy and a sturdier tray table spacious overhead bins and state-of-the-art HEPA cabin air filtration systems as well as access to Wi-Fi and power ports. All customers will enjoy the wireless in-flight entertainment system created by wholly-owned subsidiary Delta Flight Products with personalized entertainment experiences at every seat.

While the A321neo will deploy across Delta’s domestic network its initial launch will focus on transcontinental markets from Boston.

Additionally Delta will double the number of Airbus A220 departures to at least 20 flights next year expanding the modern spacious aircraft to more business markets like Nashville and Raleigh-Durham. As of this fall Delta is already operating the A220 from Boston to Austin Dallas/Fort Worth Cincinnati New York City and Chicago. The aircraft’s customer-friendly onboard experience includes the widest Main Cabin seats in Delta’s fleet high-capacity overhead bins and extra-large windows among other innovations.

Delta continues to give customers even more ways to reclaim the joy of travel – all underpinned by our science-backed health and safety efforts – which include refreshed menus from top restaurants industry-leading seatback entertainment a new Spotify partnership and Delta SkyMiles being named a Best Travel Rewards Program by U.S. News for the fifth consecutive year.

Airlines still have about 70% of their pre-pandemic international capacity in hibernation but Delta is returning aircraft to the skies because the U.S. domestic market is recovering faster than in other parts of the world.

Parking a plane and bringing it back to life after months of inactivity isn’t as simple as turning the engines off and on. It takes a lot of effort including maintenance and electrical checks to keep an aircraft in a ready state for future use.

As the pandemic reached the U.S. in March 2020 Delta (NYSE: DAL) began parking aircraft in Blytheville Arkansas; Kansas City Missouri; Marana Arizona; and Birmingham Alabama. Each location had separate challenges such as humidity desert heat or bugs and small animals nesting in crevices.

In some regions of the world for example mud dauber wasps clog exterior speed-sensing tubes with mud. Maintenance personnel are instructed to regularly check the probe covers for damage.

Over the weekend the airline scheduled a massive service expansion in the city with two new long-haul routes three new domestic destinations increased frequencies modernized planes and much more. The network updates were first seen in Cirium timetables and later confirmed to TPG by the airline.

We'll break down all the updates below but the storyline here is clear: Delta isn't going to stand by while American Airlines and JetBlue team up in the Northeast and encroach on its position in Boston.

2 long-hauls go up against AA's NYC expansion

Next summer travelers headed to or from Boston Logan Airport (BOS) will enjoy new Delta nonstop service to Athens (ATH) and Tel Aviv (TLV) with flights commencing on May 27 2022 and May 26 2022 respectively according to Cirium schedules.

Both flights will operate three times per week aboard the Airbus A330 aircraft. Athens will be served by the -300 variant while Tel Aviv will be flown by one of Delta's newest widebodies the A330-900neo.

The A330-900neo offers Delta's top onboard experience with 29 Delta One Suites in the pointy end of the plane 28 Premium Select recliners 56 extra-legroom Comfort+ seats and 168 standard coach ones.

The A330-300 is currently undergoing a retrofit program to add a premium economy cabin though the aircraft's reverse herringbone biz cabin isn't as modern as the A330neo.

Adding Athens and Tel Aviv brings Delta to nine long-haul destinations from Boston. The airline is already flying to Amsterdam and Rome and is slated to resume (the temporarily suspended) service to Dublin Edinburgh Lisbon London and Paris in the coming months.

While the new routes are welcome news for Boston-based travelers adding Athens and Tel Aviv likely isn't a coincidence.

When American Airlines and JetBlue unveiled their Northeast Alliance in July 2020 the two airlines promised plenty of growth in New York and Boston. While the two carriers have since launched a slew of new routes American started two new high-profile destinations from New York-JFK as well to — you guessed it — Athens and Tel Aviv.

Delta already goes head-to-head against American on both JFK to Athens and Tel Aviv and now it seems to be one-upping the Northeast Alliance with service to both cities from Boston.

A domestic boost with 3 new routes

Delta is also doubling down on its domestic network from Boston with the introduction of three new routes on July 11 2022 to Baltimore (BWI) Denver (DEN) and San Diego (SAN).

Delta Connection partner Republic Airline will fly a 76-seat Embraer 175 to Baltimore five times a day. Once-daily service to Denver and San Diego will be operated by a Boeing 737 Cirium schedules show.

In addition to these three new markets Delta is still on track to move forward with its previously announced plans to add service to Charlotte (CLT) and Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) — two of American Airlines' largest hubs — on Oct. 10.

As you might've expected JetBlue already operates flights to all three of Delta's new domestic destinations from Boston.

Boston gets a big plane upgrade

Delta isn't just adding a bunch of new Boston routes. It's also seemingly committed to sending its fanciest jets to the city as well giving flyers another reason to choose the airline over its competitors.

For long-haul flights Delta has prioritized Boston as one of the first markets to receive its recently retrofitted jets. Last week the carrier scheduled the first two routes with its revamped Boeing 767-300 and now the retrofitted A330s are finding a home in Boston as well.

Plus with the A330neo serving Tel Aviv it'll mark the introduction of the airline's well-regarded Delta One Suites cabin to the city.

The Northeast Alliance actually spurs competition

Last month the Department of Justice filed an anti-trust lawsuit against the Northeast Alliance between American and JetBlue saying that the pact allows for anti-competitive coordination between the two carriers.

The two airlines quickly responded striking back against the DOJ with plenty of statistics new marketing campaigns and even a dedicated website neaflies.com to prove that the Northeast Alliance does in fact promote competition and deliver benefit to customers.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

The Northeast Alliance has already provoked a competitive response from Delta in recent months with a four-route expansion from Boston and New York along with a lie-flat Boeing 757 upgague on premium transcontinental routes.

Delta's latest move however is its most comprehensive response yet.

Without the Northeast Alliance it's anyone's guess if Delta would've followed through with this massive Boston expansion. One thing is clear though: With new routes larger planes and more frequencies travelers headed to or from Boston are the big winners.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1ib3N0b24tbmV3LXJvdXRlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Air Lines Adds Impressive New Routes From Boston,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1ib3N0b24tbmV3LXJvdXRlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZ3JlZWtyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8wMy9kZWx0YS1kaXJlY3QtZmxpZ2h0cy1ib3N0b24tYXRoZW5zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Adds Direct Flights from Boston to Athens - GreekReporter.com,"Delta one of the major US airlines announced on Saturday that it will be adding direct flights from Boston to Athens Greece to its routes. As of the summer of 2022 Delta plans to launch flights from Boston to both Athens and Tel Aviv.

In the past few years Delta had plans to serve up to eight transatlantic routes out of Boston including to Amsterdam Dublin Edinburgh Keflavik Lisbon London Paris and Rome.

With these two additional routes the airline could have up to 10 transatlantic routes out of Boston by next summer (or perhaps even more — who knows what else is coming).

Delta Athens flights part of carrier’s growth

The new flights to Athens and Tel Aviv are not new destinations for Delta but represent a further growth in the carrier’s long-haul international network to complement its other hubs namely New York and Atlanta.

Next summer Delta will fly three weekly flights from Boston to Athens International Airport and Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport respectively. Tel Aviv flights will start on May 26th while the Athens flights will begin on May 27th.

Delta Air Lines has slowly been building up its presence out of Boston. Its newest hub the airline has a robust 2022 planned from Boston. The long-haul routes are part of Delta’s hub expansion in Boston.

On the route to Tel Aviv Delta will fly the Airbus A330-900neo. Delta’s A330neos seat 281 passengers in a three-class configuration. On the Athens flights it will use an Airbus A330-300 for the route featuring 293 seats including 34 business class seats and 259 economy class seats.

The Airbus A330-300 aircraft are currently undergoing a retrofit to feature new Premium Select seats. The route will operate with the following schedule: DL240 Boston to Athens departing at 6:55PM arriving at 12:30PM (+1 day) and DL241 Athens to Boston departing at 2:45PM arriving at 7:15PM.

The flight will operate 3x weekly eastbound on Wednesdays Fridays and Sundays and westbound on Mondays Thursdays and Saturdays. It will cover a distance of 4755 miles and is blocked at 10hr. 35min eastbound and 11hr. 30min westbound.

Delta’s Boston flights complements New York Athens-bound route

The new route complements Delta’s seasonal service to Athens from both Atlanta and New York. No airline has flown nonstop between the city hosting the 17 times NBA champions Boston Celtics and Athens in the past decade.

Boston is also a major city in the Northeast Alliance between American Airlines and JetBlue. Those two airlines have announced some growth out of Boston but almost all of it has been domestic and short-haul international flying.

American Airlines American has recently launched flights from New York to both Athens and Tel Aviv. It seems like Delta feared that American might soon do the same in Boston so Delta decided to beat American to the punch.

This move by Delta is an obvious response to the partnership between American and JetBlue. Will American decide to replicate these routes as well or if the airline continues to focus its long haul expansion on New York? Time will tell."

Recent census data shows its population has grown by a mere five in a decade. And the village's 286 residents are in some respects no fans of progress.

For centuries Alverdiscott has been pronounced 'Alscott' but since Victorian times the inhabitants have doggedly refused mapmakers' pleas to update its obsolete spelling.

Now however sleepy Alverdiscott near Barnstaple and close to the North Devon coast is to become the pulsating epicentre of an unprecedented revolution in global energy.

Investors are raising mind-spinning sums of money in order to connect the village directly to North Africa using the world's longest undersea electric cable.

This is planned to bring wind and solar energy 2360 miles from Morocco to power 7 million British homes by 2030.

Sleepy Alverdiscott near Barnstaple and close to the North Devon coast is to become the pulsating epicentre of an unprecedented revolution in global energy

The £16 billion venture aims to bypass fundamental problems with British wind and solar energy.

Our winds are unpredictable and tend to blow at times of the day when demand for electricity is weakest. As for British sunshine well.

Meanwhile in the Guelmim-Oued Noun region of Morocco where the green power will be generated the reliable Trade Winds blow year-round.

Equally handy wind speeds at the Morocco site increase throughout the late afternoon and evening which coincides with times of peak UK demand.

The sun also blazes for some 3500 hours a year.

By contrast Britain averages only 1500 annual hours of sunshine.

And because the sun burns more intensely over North Africa solar panels there each produce about three times more electricity than in the UK even during winter when we most need power for heat and light.

The Xlinks Morocco-UK Power Project involves building an inordinate amount of new kit to generate and transport the green energy.

It means covering 1500 sq km of Moroccan desert with solar panels wind turbines and a massive battery storage unit.

And undersea cables made of copper or aluminium and wrapped in polyethylene insulator will bring the energy generated to Devon.

Four of these cables are needed each threaded along a shallow-water route past Spain Portugal and France to Alverdiscott.

In the village two 1.8 GW voltage source converter stations which resemble massive Meccano skeletons will be built.

(1.8GW is the generating capacity predicted for the proposed Norfolk Vanguard wind farm in the North Sea which would be made up of 180 turbines measuring up to 1150 ft tall.)

The £16 billion venture aims to bypass fundamental problems with British wind and solar energy. Pictured: A huge solar power station in Ouarzazate Morocco

Each new converter station will cost about £75 million and be the size of two football pitches.

And if their sheer size doesn't make them stand out a National Grid technical factsheet warns that such stations' huge transformers 'are sited outdoors and can generate significant levels of audible noise'.

The converter stations are needed because the green electricity is converted at the Morocco site from conventional high-voltage alternating current (HVAC) power to high-voltage direct current (HVDC).

In layman's terms they're converting AC to DC like gigantic toy railway-set transformers. Once the power reaches Alverdiscott it is converted back to AC.

Why? Most power lines are AC and so is most electrical equipment. But for any distance longer than 300 miles DC is better as it's more efficient and reliable.

Transporting the energy of sun and wind from Africa to power UK homes sounds brilliant if somewhat fantastical.

It brings to mind the professor in Gulliver's Travels who plans to extract sunbeams from cucumbers to bottle and sell in winter.

But this is absolutely serious. The vast project is led by former Tesco boss Sir David Lewis. The Alverdiscott converter stations have already been granted permission to connect to the UK electricity network by National Grid (which is understandably cautious about anyone doing this).

Sir David is also raising £800 million to build three UK factories to tap into growing demand for the electric cables used for offshore wind farms and undersea interconnectors.

A spokesman for Xlinks says of the Moroccan plan: 'This 'first of a kind' project will generate 10.5 GW of zero-carbon electricity from the sun and wind.'

Morocco has huge expertise in this area having invested heavily in renewables. It currently boasts the largest concentrated solar-power project in the world — the Noor plant in the Agadir region.

The country already sells electricity from solar power. Its exports to Spain are made via undersea cables just like — but very much shorter than — the ones proposed for Britain.

The use of these cables or interconnectors has increased in recent years as they allow countries to trade electricity.

Last week the Financial Times reported how the UK recently completed the world's longest existing interconnector between Norway and Northumberland in North-East England.

It cost about £1.7 billion and stretches 450 miles across the North Sea.

However the cost and logistics of laying a cable as long as the one Xlinks is planning are another proposition altogether.

There is also the question of how green the project really is given the huge amount of construction equipment and infrastructure such as cabling involved.

A company spokeswoman admits that while the whole project's costs have been worked out 'currently the lifecycle CO2 emissions for the Xlinks Morocco –UK Power Project have not yet been calculated'.

She argues however that: 'Xlinks want to be part of the global effort to stop global warming and as such the technologies and the locations the project uses will be chosen to avoid any harm to the environment and the livelihoods of the local communities.'

Some experts are concerned. In February environmental researchers warned in the journal The Conversation that covering Morocco with massive solar farms could actually increase global warming.

They say solar panels reflect more of the sun's heat back into the environment than does the desert ground they cover.

This could push up local temperatures by as much as 2.5c they add and have global knock-on effects such as disrupting rainfall across the world even causing drought in the Amazon rainforests.

Yet all this is balanced by the UK's urgent need for energy security — particularly as it moves to rely increasingly on renewables.

Britain's vulnerability here was exposed last month when electricity prices in the UK surged to 11 times the normal levels.

The record high was caused by a crunch in the gas supply chain and a lack of wind to power turbines.

Of particular concern is our dependence on a European gas supply dominated by Russia.

Last month Russia was accused of increasing gas prices in a bid to undermine Britain and the EU's economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.

More than 40 MEPs signed a letter accusing Gazprom of 'deliberate market manipulation' by ratcheting up gas prices to record levels.

The growing crisis has further fuelled fears that the Kremlin is able to exert massive leverage over Europe through its supply of natural gas.

Xlinks argues that directly importing green power from Morocco a country with a record of stability will safeguard the UK against foreign fuel interference and 'price gouging' or sudden increases in price — whether by the Russians or our EU neighbours.

'The power generated will be transmitted directly to Britain without connection to the Moroccan Spanish Portuguese or French transmission networks' it says.

'This provides confidence that no matter what is happening Britain will have exclusive access to reliable power from the Moroccan wind and solar resources.'

So far none of this global power-play has made headlines in Alverdiscott's parish newsletter The Local Rag.

David Potter its assistant editor who lives 100 metres from the village's current modest electricity substation is rather bemused at the prospect.

'It sounds bizarre' he says. 'We've not been told anything. And no one round here seems to know anything about it.

'As a neighbour said to me yesterday if the news had come in April we would have read it as a joke. As it is we're very much in the dark.'",,,,,,,,,,,,

For: Teresa Kwok 16 South Island School

Many students benefit from private tutoring because they receive extra support on their studies. However many parents in mainland China push their children to attend private tutoring classes to stand out from their peers. The same phenomenon happens in Hong Kong so banning private tutoring here would help students to take breaks from their schoolwork and relieve their stress.

Banning private tutoring reduces pressure on parents and students in the city’s hypercompetitive education system. Hong Kong students are often pressured to attend private tuition to do well on exams. Students often do lots of past papers to build their exam skills but this can cause them to lose motivation to study and discover new interests. This excessive drilling is why private tutoring should be banned.

Hot topics: China’s approach to reining in private tuition

The city’s students are already studying in a rigid and competitive environment with many homework assignments and tests. Private tutoring sessions intensify the competition. If one student receives more training others will apply for tutoring sessions to improve their exam skills.

Attending these extra classes also keeps students from exploring other interests. For example many primary students are forced to attend tutoring sessions for every subject rather than going to extracurricular activities such as sports and arts. This then hinders their development as a well-rounded person.

Private tutoring harms students’ health especially for primary and kindergarten students. While it is meant to benefit kids’ learning students do not have time to rest which affects their mental and physical health.

Banning private tutoring will stop the spiralling competitiveness in our city’s education and help students be healthier and more well-rounded.

If private tuition is banned will Hong Kong’s students really be better off? Photo: K. Y. Cheng

Against: Alexander Bray 17 Island School

Hong Kong should not ban private tuition. The move would be catastrophic and would put tutors out of work. Tutoring is important for three main reasons: catching up to one’s peers assisting with language acquisition and getting an edge for university.

When a student is struggling with a subject in school conventional wisdom says to give them more assistance so they can understand the concepts.

Hong Kong’s school curriculum is tough and the knowledge and skills needed to stay with the class level can often be overwhelming. Extra assistance is often needed just to keep up with the class. Also some students may have learning difficulties and need specialised tutors so they do not fall behind.

The new face of liberal studies in Hong Kong

Another important benefit of tutoring is that it helps with language acquisition. The best way to acquire a new language is through hours of practice and the hours in a classroom at school are not nearly enough to gain fluency. Tutoring is especially helpful for those who are studying difficult languages such as French or Chinese.

Finally Hong Kong has a competitive academic culture that is directly connected to the use of tutoring to get better grades in preparation for university.

Many overseas schools see the city’s students as high-quality candidates because of their hard-working attitudes and high academic standards. To keep up with Hong Kong’s existing reputation it is imperative that tutoring continue to help students excel. For many private tuition also gives them the chance to explore subjects they enjoy at a more advanced level than what might be offered at their schools.

The tutoring industry is a valuable asset to Hong Kong students for many reasons and the government should not ban private tuition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpY25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvbmV3LWJydW5zd2ljay1qb2JzLXRoYXQtYXJlLWluLWRlbWFuZC1kdWUtdG8tY292aWQtMTktMTAxOTMyMC5odG1s0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2ljbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC9uZXctYnJ1bnN3aWNrLWpvYnMtdGhhdC1hcmUtaW4tZGVtYW5kLWR1ZS10by1jb3ZpZC0xOS0xMDE5MzIwLmh0bWwvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Brunswick jobs that are in demand due to COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our work. Some of us had to transition to working from home and others lost their jobs or saw their hours reduced because of public health measures in place.



The Canadian government released a study about how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the labour market in New Brunswick.

While some jobs were negatively affected by the pandemic other jobs saw an increase in demand. Some of these jobs are listed below with the corresponding National Occupational Classification (NOC) code.

https://youtu.be/A2SvLe8s20s

1. Management jobs and business finance and administration jobs

The following are the jobs that are in demand:

Computer and information systems managers (NOC 0213)

The level of employment of computer and information systems managers was negatively impacted by the pandemic. However it is now expected to gradually recover to pre-pandemic levels.

Some employers have found it difficult to find computer and information systems managers with the skills required to carry out the duties and responsibilities of the job.

Financial auditors and accountants (NOC 1111)

Financial auditors and accountants fared well throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and employees were able to avoid job losses.

This is because the main functions of the job allowed for employees to transition to working from home. In addition the beginning of the pandemic coincided with the busy tax season. This may have played a role in avoiding layoffs.

In recent years this job has been in high demand and some shortage of financial auditors and accountants may be expected.

2. Natural and applied sciences and related jobs

These jobs are usually in industries that were fairly unexposed to the COVID-19 pandemic such as engineering and design services. In fact for some jobs in natural and applied sciences employment increased during March and April 2020 when the rest of the economy was struggling due to the shutdown of various non-essential businesses. Employment in these industries is expected to keep increasing over the next couple of years.

Here are some of the jobs that are in demand:

Information systems analysts and consultants (NOC 2171);

Computer programmers and interactive media developers (NOC 2174);

Computer network technicians (NOC 2281);

User support technicians (NOC 2282).

3. Health care jobs

There has been a significant increase in demand for health care services because of the pandemic.

The level of employment of health care jobs trended upward for more than two decades and stabilized in the two years leading up to the pandemic.

Here are some of the jobs that have been positively impacted:

Licensed practical nurses (NOC 3233);

Nurse aides orderlies and patient service associates (NOC 3413).

4. Jobs in education law and social community and government services

Various teachers saw a significant change in how they do their work after shifting to teaching remotely. Labour shortages have been reported in the francophone school system.

The pandemic caused longer periods of staying at home which in turn caused a rise in domestic disturbances. This increased demand for social services.

Here are some of the jobs that are in demand:

Secondary school teachers (NOC 4031) - in the francophone school system;

Elementary school and kindergarten teachers (NOC 4032) - in the francophone school system;

Social workers (NOC 4152);

Early childhood educators and assistants (NOC 4214).

5. Trades transport and equipment operators and related jobs

More than a quarter of workers in these jobs are over 55 years old. This means that job opportunities may increase as more workers retire.

Job losses were minimal for these jobs. This may be because very few of these jobs are in industries that were hit hard by the pandemic.

Truck drivers were negatively impacted during the beginning of the pandemic because of a lower demand of some goods. However there has been a shortage of truck drivers in certain cities like Moncton and Saint John.

Here are some jobs that increased in demand:

Electricians except industrial and power system (NOC 7241);

Carpenters (NOC 7271);

Transport truck drivers (NOC 7511);

How you can immigrate to New Brunswick

If you have work experience you can use it to apply for permanent residence through Canada’s federal economic class programs such as the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) and the Canadian Experience Class (CEC).

You will need to create a profile on Canada’s federal Express Entry system to apply for any of these federal programs. These programs however are only for— what Canada considers— “skilled work.”

All of the jobs listed above would be considered skilled except for the following:

Nurse aides orderlies and patient service associates (NOC 3413); and

Transport truck drivers (NOC 7511).

Express Entry is not your only choice. New Brunswick also has its own Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) with immigration options for those with skilled work experience.

For example the province has the New Brunswick Skilled Worker Stream for those who have received a full-time permanent job offer in the province.

In addition to Express Entry and the PNP you may also choose to immigrate to New Brunswick through the Atlantic Immigration Pilot (AIP).

This is a fast-track program that allows employers to hire foreign nationals for jobs that they were not otherwise able to fill. Employers need to be in an Atlantic province in order to be eligible to hire foreigners through the AIP. The Atlantic provinces are: New Brunswick Nova Scotia Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island.

One advantage of the program is that employers do not need to get a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) which is a document that proves that there are no Canadian citizens or permanent residents available for the job.

Also for a limited time Canada is offering pathways for essential workers who worked in the country during the pandemic. Nurses aides orderlies and patient service associates are among 40 healthcare occupations that may apply for immigration through the pathways for essential workers. There are 20000 spots reserved for health care workers who worked in the country during the pandemic. Applications are open until November 5 or until the intake cap is reached.

The importance of capacitating children and the youth in Zimbabwe with financial literacy skills is borne out in the fact that the country has an “extremely youthful population.”

“Approximately 6 million people living in Zimbabwe are under 15 years old (43 percent of the total) and the population is therefore overwhelmingly young” said Finmark Trust in a 2020 report on Zimbabwe.

Within a few years these youths will be entering the economically active population and they will need proper skills to make solid financial decisions.

Insurance is part of the broader scope of financial literacy but an informal survey by The Sunday Mail showed that children and the youths have very limited comprehension of what insurance entails.

Even in this day and age a good number of people only discover insurance when they are compelled to sign up for funeral and/or health insurance on their first jobs or when they buy their first cars and realise they have to comply with the statutory third-party insurance.

However that is tantamount to teaching old dogs new tricks.

The numbers do not lie: According to a 2019 Baseline Survey on Insurance and Pensions Awareness and Uptake which was carried out by the Insurance and Pensions Commission (IPEC) nationally 34 percent of Zimbabweans had at least one insurance policy while the balance (66 percent) had no insurance policy of any kind.

Of the 34 percent who had any insurance 76 percent used funeral insurance while 20 percent were on motor insurance.

There is a clear correlation between financial literacy (or lack thereof) and the level of financial inclusion.

Financial experts say financial literacy like most knowledge is better grasped at a very young age.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) through its ‘Principles and Good Practices for Financial Education and Awareness’ advocates that financial education start as early as possible.

“Financial education is a long-term process. Building it into curriculums from an early age allows children to acquire the knowledge and skills to build responsible financial behaviour throughout each stage of their education” says the OECD.

“This is especially important as parents may be ill-equipped to teach their children about money and levels of financial literacy are generally low around the world.”

On a positive note however IPEC along with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) – were the national coordinators for the Global Money Week (2021).

Other participating organisations included Old Mutual Insurance Cell Insurance and Zimnat Insurance which meant that the local commemorations of the Global Money Week had a skew towards insurance issues.

IPEC public relations manager Mr Lloyd Gumbo said the Global Money Week is only one of the initiatives that they utilise to raise awareness about insurance to children and the youth.

“We participate in the Global Money Week every year in March targeting children and the youth to sensitise them on financial issues particularly insurance and pensions. Before Covid-19 we would visit schools and do presentations to pupils.

“However with Covid-19 disruptions we now focus more on online activities.

“We leverage digital and social media with content that’s relevant for children and the youth.”

Through this year’s Global Money Week initiatives about 200 000 children and youth were reached through several digital activities.

But – as put forward by the OECD – financial literacy should be both constant and consistent which requires it to be implemented from the family unit and at curriculum level in schools.

From another perspective teaching children about insurance is also vital for the future of the industry.

If as alluded to earlier most people discover about insurance in their early-to-mid-twenties it raises important questions about professionals in the sector; not least where do they come from?

Because there tends to be very limited awareness of insurance matters amongst children and the youth very few tend to view jobs in insurance as a career option.

Morgan & Co head of research Mr Batanai Matsika says insurance companies have a strong incentive to ‘catch them young’.

“A look at the insurance sector labour market in Africa reveals that of the total work force a large percentage are unintentional workers.

“It is also estimated that 40 percent of the workforce in the sector will become eligible for retirement in the next three years” he said in a recent note.

“There is need for insurance companies in Africa to establish forums for young future leaders to develop and share their expertise and skills.”",,,

Yes Century is now home to two Dollar Generals.

Now that a new Dollar General has opened in Century less than two miles from an aging store many residents want to know if the old one will close.

We took that question to Dollar General’s corporate office.

“The other store on North Century Boulevard will be staying open” Katie Ellison senior manager Dollar General Corporation Public Relations told NorthEscambia.com.

She said the new store will not replace the current Century Dollar General that’s just over a mile and a half away on North Century Boulevard near the state line the Food Giant and a Family Dollar. The old Century Dollar General opened in July 2002 in a building that was constructed in 1970.

The new 9291 square foot Dollar General in the 7000 block of North Century Boulevard in Century opened late last week.

Foreman was convicted of domestic violence in Crawford County Municipal Court in July. She was sentenced to 90 days in jail which was suspended. She was placed on two years of community control and a protective order for the victim was put in place. She was to have no direct or indirect contact with the victim who is a partner to the father of Foreman’s child.

According to Prosecutor Matt Crall Foreman was sitting on a bench outside of Dollar General when the victim pulled into the store. The victim called police who responded telling Foreman that she needed to leave the area. A frustrated Foreman told police she was there first and therefore the victim should have to leave.

Foreman became combative with police who suspected an impairment of some kind. Police attempted to arrest her and she resisted arrest. She bit one of the policemen.

She is charged with one count of assault a felony of the fourth degree punishable with up to 18 months in prison violating a protection order a first-degree misdemeanor resisting arrest a first-degree misdemeanor and possession of drug paraphernalia (a pipe).

Crawford County Common Pleas Court Judge Sean Leuthold entered a not guilty plea on Foreman’s behalf and appointed attorney Brian Gernert to represent her.

Prosecutor Crall told the court that he believed a $5000 cash bond would be necessary.

Attorney Gernert explained to the court that Foreman suffers from mental health problems and she hadn’t been taking her medication.

He asked the court for a personal recognizance bond so she could resume counseling and get back on her medication. He said the victim used the protection order to harass his client.

Judge Leuthold expressed concern for Foreman’s well-being.

“When I see someone with mental health issues not taking their medication and possibly doing drugs I am very concerned. I am going to set this for a hearing on Monday. In the meantime I don’t feel good leaving her unsupervised out in the community. I am setting bond at $10000. I want a mental health evaluation for Ms. Foreman. I may reassess bond on Monday. We want to get her on a good mental Heath path” Leuthold said."

Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced an aid package of 206 million euros approximately $238 million on Sunday during his third visit to the island since the eruptions started on Sept. 19 according to the Associated Press.

Jorge Guerrero / AFP via Getty Images / AFP via Getty Images The Cumbre Vieja volcano pictured from El Paso spews lava ash and smoke in the Canary Island of La Palma on Friday.

""We are facing a test of resistance because we don't know when the volcano's eruption will end"" Sánchez said in a press conference. ""But citizens should know that when it does end the government of Spain will be there to help with the enormous task of rebuilding La Palma and offer a horizon of prosperity.""

Two additional fissures nearly 50 feet apart opened up on Friday sending more lava headed toward the ocean the AP reported.

The activity coming from the Cumbre Vieja volcano does not show signs of slowing down any time soon. The Canary Islands Volcanology Institute has been monitoring the eruptions and noted on Twitter on Sunday morning that explosive activity was intensifying and by afternoon effusive activity had increased.

La Palma government officials have continued to monitor the air quality around the eruptions and say they did see an increase in sulfur dioxide levels after the latest fissures opened but it wasn't a present health threat to residents according to the AP.

Earlier sea-bound lava spills prompted officials on the island to tell residents to seal their doors and windows to block the toxic gas that's created when molten lava hits the ocean.

More than 900 houses have been destroyed by lava flow according to the European Union's Earth-monitoring program Copernicus.

Of the nearly 85000 people who live in La Palma more than 6000 of them have been evacuated since the eruptions began. No deaths or injuries have been reported as a result of the eruptions so far.

Prime Minister Sánchez said he would focus on finding solutionsfor those who lost their homes rebuilding agricultural infrastructure and destroyed urban environments as well as relaunching tourism and making sure transportation across the island is possible once the volcanic activity ceases.

Prior to this year the last eruption on the island took place in 1971 and lasted for more than three weeks.

Last week Costco said it would limit purchases on bath tissues roll towels Kirkland Signature water and high-demand cleaning products related to an uptick in coronavirus cases. Chief financial officer Richard Galanti estimated on the company's fourth quarters earnings call that overall price inflation for its products is now in the range of 3.5% to 4.5% up from the previous quarter's estimate of 2.5% to 3.5% and that both Costco and its suppliers are paying two to six times more for containers and shipping.

In addition to placing its orders earlier Galanti said Costco would charter three of its own container ships to transport goods between Asia and North America. Each ship will carry about 800 to 1000 containers at one time and the company plans to make approximately 10 deliveries over the course of 2022.

As companies work to mitigate costs and keep up with demand ahead of the holiday season some experts are warning consumers to buy ""hard-to-get"" items sooner rather than later.

""These delays are significant"" Freightwaves founder and CEO Craig Fuller told FOX Business’ Maria Bartiromo on Friday. ""I would recommend everyone to go ahead and buy those hard-to-get items now versus waiting until the holidays.""

Fuller expects toys clothing and electronics will be the hardest items to come by this year and that the supply chain may not normalize until 2023.

In the past year inflation rose 4.3% up slightly from the previous month and the highest in more than three decades. However Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell expressed hope on Thursday that the supply chain problems could start improving next year potentially pushing inflation lower within the first half of 2022.

Despite the supply chain bottlenecks consumer spending rose 0.8% in August up from 0.1% in July and higher than the 0.6% increase expected by economists surveyed by Refinitiv."

The conversation occurred in conjunction with Anderson’s appearance as a featured speaker – via Zoom – at the tri-state Shale Insight industry conference in Erie Pa.

Anderson said his Shale Insight talk focused largely on carbon capture and sequestration (CCUS) and “looking at the technologies we need to develop as our energy system transforms over the coming decades to a lower carbon energy system.”

During the transition he said renewables will continue to expand and “we’ll need lots of grid-scale storage. There’s a significant need to simply decarbonize our fossil energy resources as they present a great on-demand firm power production on the power side.”

Fossil fuels also power the transportation sector he said and decarbonizing transportation has to begin with fossil fuels.

NETL has been working over the last 25 years to develop CCUS technologies he said. They’re starting to see a lot of commercial interest in deployment and they’re now working on transformational technologies to get CCUS into the market.

That sparked a brief discussion of making hydrogen mostly used in refineries for now and considered a green fuel.

The chief means of producing “blue hydrogen” he said is steam methane reforming which requires burning natural gas to reform methane into hydrogen and carbon dioxide from which they capture and sequester the CO2.

But they are exploring an alternate cleaner way to produce blue hydrogen with microwaves. That method can produce hydrogen faster with less energy.

And there’s turquoise hydrogen produced via “methane pyrolysis” which uses high temperatures to break the methane into hudrogen and solid carbon that doesn’t have to be sequestered and can be used to make carbon fibers and other products.

“When we start putting all of these technological pieces together we can start to see the pieces of the puzzle coming together – what the energy system is going to look like in 30 years” Anderson said.

Appalachian Storage Hub

In the context of Shale Insight we asked Anderson how President Biden’s 2030 clean energy goals might affect the tri-state goal of an Appalachian Storage Hub to spark and serve a petrochemical industry boom here to complement the Gulf Coast industry subject to severe weather disruptions.

Anderson said Biden’s goals need to be followed by market drivers which haven’t been set yet – such as the cost of CO2 and renewable portfolio standards.

Right now he said there’s only once market incentive for reducing CO2 emissions from fossil fuel power plants the 45Q tax credit. “That has resulted in a lot of interest from the private sector.” They are seeing some projects receive capital financing for that.

But the credit has a a sunset date and some limits he said. When we see market mechanisms for capital markets to invest in CO2 reduction “then we can start to see technologies advance and deploy” and the costs of deploying the technology will come down.

NETL has a Center for Sustainable Fuels and Chemicals Anderson said focused on technologies that go into decarbonizing petrochemical and plastic wastes to create a circular economy built on increased reuse and recycling and more more efficient cracking and production.

The fleet of crackers around the world he said are at a disadvantage because it costs more to retrofit than to build new. This region has a little bit of an advantage if new build-out has advanced technologies with a lower carbon footprint.

Interagency Working Group

Anderson is executive director of Biden’s Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization (IWG) which pools the efforts of 11 federal agencies “to ensure the shift to a clean energy economy creates good-paying union jobs spurs economic revitalization remediates environmental degradation and supports energy workers in coal oil and gas and power plant communities across the country.”

The group just met on Sept. 27 Anderson said and news can be expected on efforts of each to work with coal and natural gas communities to aid them through the energy transition. The IWG is holding stakeholder events in energy communities across the country “to understand their vision of the future and identify agency resources” to support them.

The co-chairs of the IWG Anderson said are Biden’s national climate advisor and economic policy assistant. That determines the focus of the group. “It’s jobs jobs and climate hand in hand. We’re not driving climate policy we’re driving how climate policy and jobs policy go hand in hand.”

Because navigating aid from 11 agencies can be daunting at best and most small energy communities – Welch or Matewan for instance – don’t have grant writers sitting around IWG is also creating an integrated process where requests will go to IWG which will then navigate the other agencies he said.

“This is something that has been a passion of mine to find the right pathway for us to navigate our future to create economic diversity create value from the resources we have and create sustainable – economically and socially and family sustainable futures. It’s a challenging problem” he said.

But the agencies’ commitment has been astounding he said. They need to come to the table to make a difference because the transition is affecting real people. “If we’re going to tackle the climate crisis on one hand that’s going to force folks out of jobs we can’t just do it and leave communities behind.”

Sierra Club and CCUS

In conjunction with the conversation with Anderson on CCUS we asked Jim Kotcon with the Sierra Club West Virginia chapter to offer Sierra’s view on CCUS – which he abbreviates with the alternate CCS.

He wrote in an email exchange “The Sierra Club recognizes that Carbon Capture and Sequestration will likely be needed for hard-to-decarbonize industries such as steel or cement and that CCS with biofuels will be an important mechanism for ‘negative emissions’ – pulling CO2 out of the atmosphere and burying it underground.

“CCS for traditional fossil fuel power plants is unlikely to be cost-effective as renewables are already cheaper than fossil fuels in the majority of the U.S. and adding the cost of CCS will only exacerbate that difference. As the cost of both renewables and battery storage continue to decline while the cost of fossil fuels goes up the Sierra Club position is to oppose all new fossil fuel-fired power plants and most fossil fuel infrastructure as those dollars are better spent developing carbon-free renewables.

“An excellent example of that is playing out right now before the Public Service Commission. ApCo [Appalachian Power] is seeking to require WV ratepayers to pay the full cost for upgrades to the Mitchell Mountaineer and John Amos power plants. Those plants are co-owned with Kentucky and Virginia both of whom denied that request and recognize that further investments are not cost-effective. We oppose forcing WV ratepayers to bear the full cost of those plant upgrades and in effect subsidizing electricity for out-of-state customers.”

America has some of the best fast-casual dining and fast food in the whole world. It does food chains well and people love them. But we'd be lying if we said that we didn't get a little envious sometimes when we see something delicious that's only available in another country. (Cough cough Burger King Malaysia's Chocolate Melt.)

The U.S. knows Domino's as a fan-favorite pizza chain where you can get fluffy cheesy pizza delivered to your door in minutes. None of its offerings made it onto Food Network's top-5 list of pizzas in America but it will always do the trick in a pinch and could be more reliable than most people you've dated.

But Domino's Japan decided to really up its game in May offering a brand-new menu item that sounds like it would be right at home in Tokyo or NYC (via Japan Today). Let's just say it takes the best of both worlds and combines them into one epic dish.",,,,,,,,,,,,

If individual investors are right the Dow Jones Industrial Average would reach about 170000 in 10 years. Professional investors are not nearly as optimistic. Their estimates put the Dow at about 75000. Why the big difference and who is likely to be right?

Let’s take a look at the numbers. Individual investors think the stock market will return around 14.5% a year after inflation (with a little inflation it’s closer to 17%). Professional investors think it will be closer to 5.3% after inflation. The long-term return for stocks after inflation is around 7%. Thus individual investors think the next decade will be twice as good for stocks than the average return over about the last 100 years. Why the optimism? It’s most likely related to their experiences over the last 10 years when stocks produced returns of around 15% after inflation.

If the stock market has been doing so well why don’t professional advisers think it will keep going? It’s likely because professional advisers are trained to look at the long-term history of stock returns not just the last 10 years. Stock market returns have swung wildly over various 10-year timeframes. Cherry picking one decade may make you overly optimistic or overly pessimistic.

For instance for the 10-year period starting in 2000 the return for the stock market was negative by about 1% per year. Because these numbers are compounded that means an investor would have lost about 9% of their money over 10 years. Thus you don’t want to project forward a terrible decade or project forward a great decade. The future is usually some sort of reversion i.e. bad decades are often followed by better decades and better decades are often followed by worse decades.

On paper it seems as though professional investors should be right. They are using long-term trends and trying to adjust for the short-term volatility that can distort assessments of longer-term numbers. This seems a rational approach and one you’d expect a professional to take.

But there are two big wild cards that professionals have no control over. The first is what is called “animal spirits.” This wild card refers to the fear and greed nature of human decision-making that can drive prices well above or below their fundamental values for long periods of time. In fact the book “Animal Spirits” by George Akerlof and Yale professor Robert J. Shiller (one of the leading authorities on stock market returns) analyzes the impact of animal spirits on markets. It’s quite a powerful force and sometimes the most powerful force in markets.

The second is government policy. Government policy has a significant impact on animal spirits. It can serve to supercharge it or squash it like a bug. For instance if tomorrow the Fed raised interest rates to 5% you can kiss this bull market goodbye. The value of stocks bonds and real estate would tank.

If professional investors are wrong about the next 10 years it will most likely be because of their assessment of government policy on animal spirits. Professional investors on average believe the Fed and Congress will eventually take away the punch bowl. Greed will then turn to fear and usher in an era of much lower returns. This has been the pattern in the past so it’s reasonable to assume at some point we’ll get policies that squash the animal spirits.

Personally I am not so sure of that. The stock and real estate markets are integral to the economy these days. They represent the two largest sources of wealth for the majority of Americans particularly the baby boomers who according to Pew Research are turning 65 at a rate of about 10000 a day. If the Fed and Congress squash those valuations they’ll be squashing the retirement dreams and finances of the majority of Americans.

Now because government leaders (particularly at the Fed) believe that at some point their job is to stop the party I expect they’ll try to quell the animal spirits. But the implications of this could be severe because they have facilitated an excessive amount of growth in stock and real estate values. The imbalances are so massive that trying to correct them may lead to a great unwinding in financial markets. Fearing another “collapse” they may ride to the rescue with another dose of accelerant for the animal spirits.

As an investor it would behoove you to pay attention to the overarching trend of how government policy might impact animal spirits. These days it may be the most important thing to get right.

Isla de las Munecas. avf71/Shutterstock

As if forests weren't scary enough on their own this one located along the canals of Xochimico near Mexico City is covered in dolls that hang from the trees. Local legend has it that the island's caretaker hung the first doll to honor a little girl that he had found drowned on the island (the doll was thought to be hers).

The caretaker then felt as if he was being haunted by the girl's spirit so he continued to string up dolls in hopes of appeasing her. Fifty years and plenty of dolls later he reportedly drowned in the same spot the girl did.

Today the island has become a popular tourist destination. Visitors claim that the dolls move their eyes heads and limbs and that they're possessed by spirits.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdmlkZW9zL3RlY2gvMjAyMS8xMC8wNC9mYWNlYm9vay13aGlzdGxlYmxvd2VyLTYwLW1pbnV0ZXMtYWxnb3JpdGhtLXByb2ZpdC1zdGVsdGVyLXNvdC1uci12cHguY25u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Whistleblower: Facebook will lose money if they fix algorithm.

It is the first time that this facility is introduced in a public-sector hospital in the country for free treatment of patients said Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah while inaugurating the facility on the Ojha campus.

“This is a very expensive treatment and each procedure/ treatment costs Rs250000 and around 500 procedures are adopted in a year therefore the provincial government would bear its entire cost and the patients’ treatment would be made totally free” he added.

Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho parliamentary secretary on health Qasim Siraj Soomro health secretary Dr Kazim Jatoi Vice Chancellor of Dow University Prof Saeed Qureshi and others were present on the occasion.

Although CyberKnife which is installed at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre is a more recent invention than Gamma Knife and considered to be more comfortable for patients the Gamma Knife radiosurgery is typically done in a fewer sessions and stated to be designed specifically for brain according to experts.

500 patients will receive the treatment every year

The chief minister said that he had been told that there were more than 400 units installed worldwide and this was the first Gamma Knife installed in the public sector in Pakistan which was something to be proud of.

“We have established some remarkable facilities in health sector such as Cyber Knife at JPMC Liver Transplantation Institute at Gambat and Gamma Knife at the Dow university hospital” he said.

“We will keep serving the people of Sindh without considering any criticism of opposition parties” he vowed.

The CM said it was the performance of the PPP government in Sindh that the people gave them more votes and seats in every election.

“I don’t care what our opponents are propagating — we believe in service to the people of the province and upgrading the life of poor people” he said.

Talking about the briefing given to him about the newly established facility Mr Shah said that Gamma Knife radiosurgery was a very precise form of radiation therapy that focused intense beams of gamma rays with pinpoint accuracy to treat lesions in the brain.

Various uses

“Gamma Knife radiosurgery is called ‘surgery’ because its outcome is similar to that of a surgical procedure” he said.

“It may be noted that Gamma Knife radiosurgery can be effective in treating tumours blood vessel malformations and nerve conditions.

“The Gamma Knife radiosurgery works by damaging or destroying the DNA of tumour cells so that these cells cannot reproduce or grow. Over the time the brain tumour shrinks.”

The CM said that the Gamma Knife Centre was home to the Leksell Gamma Knife Icon “the latest Gamma Knife system”.

This stationary unit enables our neurosurgeons and radiation oncologists to provide world-class care he said and added Leksell Gamma Knife Icon was designed specifically for treating lesions in the brain and has the “greatest precision and accuracy of any radiosurgery system to date”.

Mr Shah said that he had been told that Gamma Knife was painless bloodless and day care treatment.

“It is used to treat certain conditions of the brain many of which can only be treated by open surgery if this facility is not available.”

Brain conditions treatment

At the Gamma Knife Centre expert neurosurgeons and radiation oncologists will treat brain conditions such as primary brain tumours in particular acoustic neuroma/vestibular schwannoma pituitary tumour craniopharyngioma glioma meningioma hemangioblastoma glomus jugulare tumour and additionally: chordoma paediatric brain tumours arteriovenous malformation trigeminal neuralgia essential tremor epilepsy and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Mr Shah said that he had been told that their facility could treat 500 patients a year and each patient had to bear Rs250000 cost for the treatment. Therefore Mr Shah said that he had directed the vice chancellor to carry out treatment of patients for free and the Sindh government would bear all the expenditures.

Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho speaking on the occasion said that another advantage of the Leksell Gamma Knife Icon was its superior ability to spare healthy brain tissue as compared with other systems.

Replying to a question about the KCR the chief minister said it was the need of the city and must be established.

He added that its initial PC-1 was approved and hoped that the federal government would complete it in time.

Her first book We Are All Perfectly Fine: A Memoir of Love Medicine and Healing is a national bestseller. For more information about CBC's First Person stories please see this FAQ .

Last week an obituary went viral proving that even in the middle of a global pandemic one life can still resonate.

When a reporter for the L.A. Times came across Eric Sydow's tender measured tribute to his late sister Karen he tweeted it out to his followers. Two days later  it had been viewed more than 10 million times.

Since then it's been ""liked"" by more than a quarter of a million people.

That obituary resonated with me because I had a sister like Karen. And my years of being her sibling taught me a painful truth: the world is better at caring about people like Karen in death than in life.

My sister Wendy died in 2015 at the age of 52.

She was just six when her future was upended by a cancer that over 50 years later is still the deadliest among children.

Diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour she had life-saving surgery but lost hearing sight the ability to walk and many other things she would never get back.

She liked to collect good china and could name every kind of dinosaur. - Jillian Horton

We travelled two different flight paths in life — mine full of ease and opportunity hers characterized by complications and disaster.

My sister had plenty of wants and misgivings. She mourned the life she had lost but she also dwelled in acceptance.

She brimmed with funny song lyrics occasional rage and some harrowing curse words. She loved the Muppets and the Solid Gold Dancers. She was obsessed with the idea of raising the Titanic long before it was fashionable. She liked to collect good china and could name every kind of dinosaur.

She had the best sense of humour and absolutely perfect grammar. And like Karen she too loved McDonald's.

But a fundamental truth about my sister's life is that she lived in a world that was designed to exclude her.

A fight for inclusion

She grew up in an era where children with disabilities were segregated from so-called ""normal"" kids.

My parents fought for everything — from life-sustaining treatment when they were crudely told that she had ""no brain left"" to the right for Wendy to attend regular classes.

Later they would crusade for adult housing and funding for the personal support workers who could provide her with the 24-hour care she needed to live.

It was a decades-long ordeal and all kinds of people stood in their way. I learned about ableism before it had a name. Whatever it was I just knew it was everywhere. It still is.

Our siblings are beautiful and worthy of attention and love not just in death but in life. - Jillian Horton

Lately I have been haunted by this thought: What if COVID-19 had happened while my sister was alive? Even post-vaccination she would have been at an exceedingly high risk of illness and death from respiratory complications.

I think of her small army of personal support workers — most of whom cared for her with tenderness and love.

What if any of them had refused to be vaccinated? What if they had declined to follow public health measures insisting they were an infringement on their personal freedoms? What if my sister who lived with less personal freedom than most of us could ever imagine caught COVID-19 from one of the people whose job it was to care for her?

My parents who visited her every day in a house where they managed her care could never have stayed away from her. If she'd acquired COVID-19 they would have gotten it too. I can't bear to imagine what would have happened next.

'Protect all the sisters like Karen'

COVID-19 has been especially hellish for people with disabilities and their loved ones — and perhaps the greatest mercy of my sister's difficult truncated life is that the pandemic did not overlap with it.

People like my sister and Karen endure so much hardship but most people do not consider the extent of their challenges or the many facets of their suffering.

When they die they are sometimes reduced to platitudes about the afterlife and angels on earth. But even worse when they die of COVID-19 they are often reduced to two words: ""pre-existing condition.""

I am glad Eric Sydow's tribute to his sister was able to cut through the noise and paint a picture of who she was. I hope he found solace in the attention.

I know something of his loss; I will miss my sister until I die.

And that's why in this fragile and uncertain time I just want to ask you to take steps to protect all the sisters like Karen. Families can't do it without your help. And our siblings are beautiful and worthy of attention and love — not just in death but in life.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGljYWdvc3Rhcm1lZGlhLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RoZS1kci1zZXVzcy1leHBlcmllbmNlLWFuLWltbWVyc2l2ZS1wb3AtdXAtdGhyb3VnaC10aGUtd29uZGVyZnVsLXdvcmxkLW9mLXNldXNzL2FydGljbGVfZjI5Mzg3MTYtMjQ2Zi0xMWVjLWFmNzItMGI5ZDZhMzUxMWE4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Dr. Seuss Experience: An immersive pop-up through the wonderful world of Seuss!,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

Last season’s Gallagher Premiership Rugby runners-up had lost their first two matches of the campaign and trailed 10-0 before Slade got them back into the game.

His try after good work from Tom O’Flaherty and Scotland skipper Stuart Hogg allowed them to level the scores and following a red card for Rohan Janse van Rensburg he got a second to help Chiefs to a 25-15 win chipping with a further ten points from the boot.

He was not the only international to enjoy a good day from the kicking tee as Wales fly-half Dan Biggar held his nerve to slot a late penalty for Northampton Saints in their 23-21 win over London Irish.

And Scotland fly-half Adam Hastings was similarly effective scoring 16 points in Gloucester’s 31-23 win over Worcester Warriors.

It was a similar scenario in the United Rugby Championship where Gareth Anscombe finally back after the injuries that have kept him sidelined for the better part of two years kicked six penalties for the Ospreys against former side Cardiff in an 18-14 win.

Meanwhile Italy youngster Leonardo Marin part of the Under-20s side earlier this year produced arguably the moment of the weekend when he slotted a last-gasp 35-metre drop goal to earn Benetton a 28-27 win over Edinburgh with fellow youngster Gianmarco Lucchesi crossing twice for the Italians.

Marin might have to wait a little longer for his Italy debut with current first choice ten Paolo Garbisi also in good kicking form as he slotted seven penalties for Montpellier in a 21-11 win over La Rochelle.

The game saw France centre Arthur Vincent go off in the first half with what could be a potentially serious knee injury that threatens to rule him out of the Autumn Nations Series and next year’s Guinness Six Nations.

One man in fine form however is Antoine Dupont who came off the bench for Toulouse to inspire them to a 17-11 win away to Biarritz.

Within eight minutes of coming on Dupont had created one try for Tim Nanai-Williams and scored another as he underlined why he was named Top 14 Player of the Season this week.

Matthieu Jalibert will hope to partner Dupont for France this November and he helped his cause with 15 points including a try in Bordeaux-Bègles’ win on the road against Lyon that saw them move up to second in the Top 14 table.

Elsewhere Ireland back-rower Jack O’Donoghue grabbed two tries for Munster in a 34-18 win over the Stormers while Leinster’s Max Deegan scored the only try in a 7-6 win away to the Dragons.

Finally Tom Rogers capped by Wales this summer for the first time scored two tries for Scarlets in a 36-13 win over the Lions.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The closest contender in terms of sales is a Chinese company with a German brand name: Weltmeister. The name means “World Champion” let’s find out if the company lives up to it.

Shen Hui’s rise to prominence

Weltmeister is the brainchild of Shen Hui (English name: Freeman Shen). Shen was born into a middle class family in January 1970 his father was entrepreneur his mother an architect. There’s not much known of his younger years but he enjoys a proper education. He graduates South China University with a degree in mechanical engineering in 1991 and then moves to the United States. There he studies civil engineering at the University of California for which he receives a masters degree.

His professional career begins with an electrical utility company in Texas called TXU Group. He starts as project engineer but gradually moves up to become plant manager. In 2000 he enters the car industry when he becomes general manager at Eaton Corporation an industry supplier. While he works at Eaton he also gets a MBA from the University of Minnesota. Shen then returns to China to become general manager of BorgWarner’s (Eaton parent company) Asian division.

Shen Hui

In 2007 Shen becomes the CEO of Fiat Powertrain China where he is responsible for all activities relating to engines transmission and axles for both passenger cars and commercial vehicles. His tenure at the Italian company is short though. In 2009 Li Shufu of Geely head hunts Shen to become his right hand man. Shen is named vice-president of Geely’s holding company but Li Shufu has a very special and seemingly impossible job in mind for his new recruit: get Volvo.

At the time global automotive giant Ford Motor Co owns Volvo while Geely is still a rather small Chinese brand. The odds are certainly against the Chinese. However the combination of Li Shufu’s ambition and Shen Hui’s negotiating skills and understanding of American business practices lead to the unimaginable: in August 2010 Geely wholly acquires Volvo. Shen becomes the president of Volvo Cars China while retaining a seat in the Geely Group board. His main task is reviving Volvo’s mojo which was slightly lost under Ford’s stewardship. Volvo’s current global commercial success is evidence of a job well done.

And so we arrive in 2013. Shen is president of a car company enjoying great success and board member of group planning to conquer the world. A comfortable future lies ahead. What do you do in such a situation? Obviously you resign.

And now for something completely different

Yes Shen resigns from his position at Volvo and Geely. He returns to the United States to take part in the Advanced Leadership Program of Harvard Business School. After that he joins Pateo a automotive connectivity provider in China for a short while. It all leads up to starting his own car company. In December of 2015 Shen establishes WM Motor Technology in Shanghai and registers Weltmeister as the brand name.

Weltmeister chooses a different approach than the three big startups. Shen’s company targets the mainstream segment where NIO XPeng and Lixiang are much more upmarket. This strategic decision also has its effect on the technical approach. Where the Big Three pride themselves in doing many things in-house Weltmeister has a mixed approached. Original development is linked with off-the-shelve parts and technical partnerships.

Photoshopped image of Weltmeister concept and Mitsubishi source picture

The Weltmeister cars are developed around three main concepts: the Living Pilot the Living Engine and the Living Motion. The ‘Living’ concepts revolve around smart connectivity and interactive features.

Heart of the sytem is the Living Engine. It’s Weltmeister own operating system including facial recognition and a virtual assistant. On top of that it offers a number of the most popular third party apps like Baidu maps QQ Music from Tencent or home appliance connectivity from Xiaomi. Living Pilot refers to the Level 2 ADAS systems. Initially it’s Weltmeister’s own development but since 2019 the company has a far-reaching cooperation with Baidu for next generation systems. Baidu’s advanced valet parking app debuts on Weltmeister cars. The Living Engine includes the drive system and battery. These come all from outside suppliers but Weltmeister does have its own BMS.

Production version of the Weltmeister EX5

The World catches a first glimpse of the Weltmeister car in late 2016 when leaked images appear on the internet. In true China style these images are actually photoshopped pictures out of a Mitsubishi Outlander press reader. A week after the pictures appear Weltmeister denies they made them. Probably true as the photoshopped car doesn’t resemble the final product. The real car is announced in December 2017 and revealed in on the Beijing Auto Show a few months later. Production starts of this EX5 starts in September 2018.

Detour ahead: Songliao and Zhongshun

Weltmeister builds a modern factory in Wenzhou (Zhejiang province) and as we know car production in China requires a government issued production permit. In the late 2010’s the government has mostly stopped issuing new permits for New Energy startups. The only way to get one is taking over a manufacturer that holds a permit. Weltmeister probably thought ‘better safe than sorry’ and bought not one but two manufacturers and permits. In February 2017 it buys Dalian Huanghai (a subsidiary of SG Automotive/Huanghai) and in August of the same year Shenyang Zhongshun.

Zhongshun (English name: Polarsun) is then a defunct brand and I doubt a dedicated Automaker Story article on it is very likely. So let me take a little detour and fill you in on this brand.

We have to travel all the way back to April 24 1949 when the East China Military department establishes a work shop in Nanjing City. It’s a repair shop for army vehicles. In 1952 the work shop is relocated to Dandong in Northern China to assist the military efforts regarding Korea. After the Korean War it’s retained as auto repair shop for the Shenyang Military department and renamed as PLA 7416th Factory in 1965. By then it’s already a car manufacturer assembling the Russian GAZ 69 light truck under the Songliao brand.

Songliao line-up in the 1980’s

These trucks are for military use only and we have to fast forward to the early 1980’s before Songliao enters the civilian market. They start producing passenger vans resembling the Nissan Homy/Caravan from the same era. In 1983 the company sheds its military name and is known as Shenyang Songliao Auto Works from then on. Songliao also cooperates with truck manufacturer Nanjing Automobile for the production of light trucks based on Iveco technology. At the end of the 80’s it introduces an offroad vehicle resembling the Nissan Patrol developed together with FAW.

Passenger vans are the backbone of Songliao’s production and sales. They’re modestly successful with it although not in the same league as Jinbei residing in Shanghai as well. In the early 1990’s Songliao develops a successor to its first generation vans based on the Hyundai H1. It outsources the making of the stamping dies for the car to FAW and invests over RMB 80 million for it. FAW however fails to deliver the molds the money is lost and the Hyundai based van is dead in the water.

Songliao starts negotiating with Ford over a possible joint venture in 1996. Again the company invests money in setting up new production lines but in 1999 the central government does not approve the joint venture. At the same time the military is forced to withdraw from public companies. Songliao production comes to a complete hold and the company is sold a few times. In 2002 Zhou Tianbao who has created a large industrial company manufacturing car parts takes over Songliao.

Zhou wants to set up his own car brand and buys Songliao for the production permit. He transfers the permit to a new company called Shenyang Zhongshun Automobile and that’s the end of Songliao as car producer. It continues for a while as parts supplier. When Zhongshun is in need for money a little later (2008) Songliao is stripped of its assets and sold as shell company. After many ownership transitions Songliao ends up in the hands of Jackie Chan and some other star actors in 2016 changes its name to Cultural Investment Holdings and now produces movies and video games.

Polarsun assembly line

Meanwhile Zhou Tianbao makes energetic work of Shenyang Zhongshun. The company restarts production of passenger vans with the introduction of a new range of cars. This time they’re mostly based on Toyota technology. Zhongshun’s English name is Polarsun. The brand also tries its hand at passenger cars and pickups. In 2005 and 2006 it shows a wave of new products MPVs SUVs pickups and even a sedan at several auto shows. In 2009 amidst the global financial crisis reality kicks in. Only a handful of these passenger cars have actually been assembled and sold. Polarsun is being kept alive by the passenger vans but money has run out and Zhou Tianbao gives up. Production stops again.

Erik van Ingen Schenau has put together a nice compilation of the cars made by Songliao and Polarsun at ChinaCarHistory.

A production permit does not expire so the Songliao/Polarsun permit is dormant for eight years. Then Shen Hui buys the remnants of Zhongshun Automobile and transfers the permit to his new Wenzhou production facility.

As mentioned Weltmeister also acquires Dalian Huanghai. That permit is transferred to a joint venture between a Weltmeister subsidiary and a local government investment fund in Huanggang City (Hubei province) for a second production plant. The Huanggang plant has yet to be finished.

The razor’s edge

Okay time to get back on track. Weltmeister delivers the first EX5’s in December 2018. The market reception is pretty favorable but soon Weltmeister hits a bump in the road. One of their battery cell suppliers Gushen battery produces a batch of faulty cells. Some EX5’s catch as do EV’s from other brands with the same cells. Fortunately Weltmeister has three other suppliers (CATL Lishen and Tafel) so the Gushen battery is taken off the menu.

Upgraded Weltmeister EX5-Z

In its first full year of operation Weltmeister sells around 18.000 cars. That’s right on par with NIO and XPeng who sell almost equal amounts. The next year NIO and XPeng steadily grow their sales and get way ahead of Weltmeister. The brand introduces its second model the larger EX6 Plus and upgrades the EX5 to EX5-Z. Sales are on the up again and finally in 2021 the brand seems to be picking up some speed.

In 2021 Weltmeister brings two new cars to the market. The W6 is basically a slightly redesigned EX6 Plus that benefits from the cooperation with Baidu. The W6 has several electronic systems from the software company and even debuts its valet parking system. The second new model is a mid-size sedan called E.5 (yes E dot 5) aimed at the Geely Geometry and the GAC Aion S.

Weltmeister EX6 Plus

Commercial sales of the E.5 still have to start but the car is already available for fleets and taxi companies. Which shows the different approach by Weltmeister. Instead of going for the high end market they target fleet sales car-sharing and rental companies for which NIO’s and XPengs are obviously too expensive. It’s a down to earth approach but it doesn’t mean the people at Weltmeister don’t know how to have fun. The Weltmeister Champion is a crazy 800 horsepower concept car that rivals the Tesla Model X in speed and a science fiction movie race car in looks.

Weltmeister Champion concept vehicle

The car to watch however is Weltmeister’s upcoming new sedan. Based on the Maven concept car the brand will launch a larger sedan that puts it in direct competition with the Tesla Model 3 BYD Han and XPeng P7. It will be the true test of Weltmeister’s capabilities.

Almost since the birth of the company there has been speculation about an impending IPO. First it was thought the brand would follow NIO XPeng and Lixiang and seek a listing on an American exchange. That never happened but since the beginning of this year we know Weltmeister has applied for a listing on the Shanghai STAR exchange a technology index comparable to the NASDAQ in the USA. The actual IPO has been postponed for now. Some analysts speculate that Weltmeister doesn’t possess enough original technology to qualify but probably the company just doesn’t need the money at this time.

Weltmeister W6

If there’s one advantage in having an experienced and well-connected automotive veteran as founder and CEO it’s the ability to raise funds. Shen Hui has always been very successful in that respect. The very first financing round of the company brought in over a billion dollar and subsequent fund raising has been just as profitable. Weltmeister is rather well funded for a startup and has many backers from private equity technology companies and local governments.

Shen once said when asked about the difference between NIO and and Weltmeister: “He is like Audi I am like Volkswagen. Both are fine.” That’s true but Shen definitely chose a difficult path. In the premium market there’s competition on many levels and startups can excel in new technology and clever marketing. In the mainstream segment where Weltmeister operates competition is mostly driven by price. So far Weltmeister holds its own against the large legacy automakers but the battle is far from over. Weltmeister needs to improve its sales numbers drastically to ensure its future but for Shen Hui walking the razor’s edge is most likely far more exciting than ruling the world from a plush leather seat in a big car company’s board room.

In September scientists with the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI) and InnoTech Alberta identified evidence of tiger salamanders in two wetlands.

Sydney Toni a knowledge translations specialist with ABMI says scientists know that boreal chorus frogs wood frogs and tiger salamanders have been visiting wetlands in the Edmonton area.

The proof? Environmental DNA — or eDNA — in water samples.

""All organisms shed DNA be it hairs or tissue and you can collect that in that environmental sample and analyze it to see what's there"" Toni says.

Native to North America tiger salamanders spend most of their time living in underground burrows.

They don't have a call like a frog that would register on audio monitoring equipment.

That makes them particularly difficult to detect says Brian Eaton manager of the environmental impacts at InnoTech Alberta.

""There could be 1000 of them right in front of you and you'd never hear them they don't really make noises"" Eaton says.

He says eDNA technology has been around for a couple of decades but is only now starting to be used in large-scale monitoring programs like this year-long study in the Edmonton area.

""I love amphibians I love this kind of work so the whole eDNA thing and the ability it gives us to detect and understand how these populations are changing is a wonderful innovation"" says Eaton.

The technology has also been used in Alberta fish and small mammal populations like otters and minks.

Eaton says practical applications include the detection of rare or endangered as well as invasive species.

Amphibians around the world are on the decline due to habitat loss contaminants disease and climate change.

There are 10 species of amphibians in Alberta and about half of them can be found in the Edmonton area.

'Tiger salamanders are cool' Duration 2:00 Tag along with scientists from the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI) and InnoTech Alberta as they demonstrate the eDNA gathering technique they're using to find evidence of amphibians like tiger salamanders in Edmonton-area wetlands.

Amanda Schmidt an aquatic field coordinator with ABMI sucks up water samples using a hose attached to a long pole and a pump. The water passes through two sets of filters.

""You don't actually see any of the things that you're looking for at that time"" Schmidt says.

It's only after the filters are sent back to the lab and are run through molecular analysis that eDNA traces of elusive creatures like the tiger salamander can be detected.

""This work is really important because it helps us to learn what is out in our environment and to get a good catalog of the species that are there especially with species that you can't catch easily.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi0QFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2h5YnJpZC1hbmQtZWxlY3RyaWMtdmVoaWNsZS1mdXNlcy1tYXJrZXQtdG8tZ3Jvdy1hdC1hLWNhZ3Itb2YtMjctNDktaW5jcmVhc2luZy1lbGVjdHJvbmljLWNvbnRlbnQtaW4taHlicmlkLS1lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlcy10by1ib29zdC1ncm93dGgtLXRlY2huYXZpby0zMDEzODk4MzQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hybrid and Electric Vehicle Fuses Market to grow at a CAGR of 27.49%| Increasing Electronic Content in Hybrid ...,"The market is fragmented and the degree of fragmentation will accelerate during the forecast period.

EBAY,eBay,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvcmVhZHktaGFsbG93ZWVuLWJ1eWluZy1oYXVudGVkLWRvbGwtMTcwMDU1ODAwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Get Ready for Halloween By Buying a Haunted Doll of Your Very Own from eBay,"It’s officially October which means it’s time for things to get spooky.

We’re about to enter that wonderful time of year between summer and winter where the air gets crisp leaves begin to fall the days get shorter and more importantly the nights get longer. Halloween is in a month so it’s time to start planning your costume and getting out your Halloween decorations. The truth of the matter is that you can carve pumpkins and set up 12-foot skeletons all you want but try as you might your haunted house will be more kitsch than killer.

What can you do if you really want to get spooky? There’s only one way to do it. Order a haunted doll off eBay.

Yes you can purchase haunted dolls on eBay. The trade Haunted dolls are children’s dolls that are allegedly possessed by a spirit. Unfortunately we can’t personally verify whether any particular product listing is actually inhabited by a spirit from beyond. Even so the thought of a cursed haunted doll in your home is mildly terrifying whether you believe in ghosts or not. They fall under the “Psychic & Paranormal” and “One of a Kind Gothic & Horror Dolls” categories on eBay because of course they do. Some sellers claim their haunted dolls are possessed by nice spirits but others are rated “expert only” (expert at what??? we’re not sure) and all of them are sure to amp up the scary vibes in your house by at least a few notches.

We’ve rounded up a few eBay haunted dolls below that are worth checking out. Keep in mind that just like any product you order from the infamous resell retailer the product descriptions’ claims are not guaranteed. Although in this case that might be a good thing.

Haunted Active Dolls Paranormal Abandoned Farm House Find

As the name suggests this doll was found along with several others in an abandoned farmhouse along the Kankakee River in Illinois. They were all found in a child’s bedroom along with many other possessions. Where did the owners go? It doesn’t say. All we know is the locals apparently “talk of much history with activity in this house.”

She’s described as a “fancy lady” and is about 20 inches long. Her eyes open and shut when she’s “laid down to rest” and I probably won’t sleep tonight after reading this description a few times. Yikes. She costs $47.00.

Buy: Abandoned Farm House Find $46.99

Jewel Haunted Doll

Jewel is 16 years old (the doll the spirit is much older) and is described as “very friendly” and “bonds quickly.” Don’t ask us what that means we’re not sure. Her “vessel” is 15 inches tall and she apparently died of tuberculosis in 1821. She’s described as a “welcoming spirit” to other spirits pets and children in the house and also likes to go into childrens’ bedrooms at night to check and see if they’re okay. Okay. She’s $70.00 which for that level of protection is frankly a bargain.

Buy: Jewel Haunted Doll $70.00

Mystery Cursing Doll

This haunted doll is described as a “cursing doll” that can bring misfortune to your enemies. Got anyone you absolutely hate? This could be a great gift. This seller has 15 available that can “cause harm to the ones that you target.” Ominously vague to the max. They’re apparently designed to not harm the owners who they bond with but harm the people who do you wrong. Sounds like a pretty foolproof system to me. The actual image of this doll is too scary to include in the piece so I’ve swapped in a similar image.

COINS with rare designs often fetch thousands of dollars but pieces that come with a mistake on them are also selling for a lot of money.

In fact the rarest and most valuable error coins are worth up to $599 each.

7 We round up the most valuable error coins based on recent eBay listings

Ranging from penny coins to 50 cent pieces we've rounded up the most valuable ones based on recent eBay listings.

Of course keep in mind that the coins are only worth how much someone else is willing to pay for them so you're not guaranteed a windfall.

Yet it could be worth checking your wallet or down the back of your sofa as these have all been circulated.

1969 Washington Quarter - $599

7 This Washington quarter from 1969 sold for almost $600 recently Credit: eBay

The error coin that sold for the highest price tag on eBay recently was a Washington quarter from 1969.

The first US President George Washington features on the coin which was first released in 1932.

The specific coin has been struck off-center and is mis-shaped with the eBay listing noting that it's a ""definite keeper"".

The coin racked up 28 bids and sold for $598.88 last month.

1964 Washington Quarter - $545

7 Another Washington quarter from 1964 racked up an almost as high price tag Credit: eBay

Another Washington quarter racked up a price tag of more than $500 on eBay recently.

The coin in question was a 1964 piece that had been struck on a 10 cent silver planchet.

The eBay listing racked up 25 bids before it sold for $545 on August 15.

It had been listed for $1 by the seller in Missoula Montana.

1972 Lincoln Cent - $325

7 This rare Lincoln penny sold for $325 on eBay last week Credit: eBay

This penny coin is a rare 1972 doubled die observe version of the Lincoln Memorial cent.

It sold for $325 on eBay last week after racking up 49 bids.

The Phildelphia-minted coin features the doubling of the letters ""In God We Trust"" alongside the top of the coin.

It also has the doubling of the word ""Liberty"" on the left side and the year 1972 on the right hand side.

A doubled die coin isn't properly manufactured meaning it has the appearance of two images on a single coin die.

More than 5.5billion 1972 pennies were made and experts also estimate that 20000 examples of the 1972 double die penny were accidentally made.

The specific coin in question likely sold for $325.22 on eBay due to being an ""error toned coin"" meaning it has a slightly different color.

Lincoln Wheat Cent - $305

7 Due to the minting error on this Lincoln coin the year of it is unknown Credit: eBay

Another coin that was struck off center and sold for a hefty sum on eBay was this Lincoln Wheat Memorial cent.

It sold for $305 on eBay in September after attracting 50 bids from coin collectors.

Due to the minting error the year of the coin is unknown.

The Lincoln wheat cent was replaced by the Lincoln memorial cent in 1959.

1859 50 Cent SS Republic - $292

7 The circulated 50 cent coin came from the SS Republic Credit: eBay

A 50 cent error coin recovered from a shipwreck recently sold for $292 online.

The circulated half dollar coin came from the SS Republic which was a ship that sunk off the coast of Georgia in 1865.

The ship which contained thousands of Seated Liberty half dollars was on the way to New Orleans when it was hit by a hurricane.

Because the coins were stacked in barrels the silver coins weren't corroded by saltwater like other silver pieces.

It means the details still remain on the coins according to Rarecoins.com.

The listing noted that the piece is an error coin with ""9 in the border"".

2005 Washington Quarter - $153

7 This 25 cent coin comes with an error in the text with the ""T"" in ""Trust"" barely visible Credit: eBay

Last but not least this 25 cent coin from 2005 comes with an error in the text.

The ""T"" is barely visible meaning it reads like ""In God We Rust"".

The Washington coin sold for $152.50 on eBay in August having racked up 14 bids.

We've also rounded up the most valuable US coins worth up to $10633.

As you could easily figure out by simply reading its name the Bel-Camino is a mix of two cars namely a 1965 Chevrolet El Camino and a 1957 Bel Air . The custom model looks… intriguing to say the least as it’s a Bel Air from the front and an El Camino from the rear so for some diehard Chevy fans it could be the best thing that ever happened.Built with drag racing in mind but also ready for street driving too the Bel-Camino comes with zero rust and the photos pretty much speak for themselves.It comes in a pretty good shape so it doesn’t need any fixes as it’s ready to become your awkward daily driver if that’s what you’re interested in.However I would personally think twice about that daily driver part after checking out what’s under the hood.Once again this Bel Air – El Camino mix was built for drag racing so the engine under the hood is now capable of developing more power than many drivers out there can handle in the first place.Under the hood there’s now a 383 (6.2-liter) featuring all kinds of customizations and mechanical upgrades and thanks to Dual Quad 750 carbs it can now develop over 500 horsepower. Again eBay seller countryclassicsltd says the car can also be driven on the street so the Bel-Camino can easily become one of the fastest (if not the fastest) cars in your neighborhood.So how much is such a custom car really worth? This is pretty hard to stay especially since it’s a one-of-a-kind model but the Internet will be the one to decide its price as part of a no-reserve auction on eBay. The top bid at the time of writing is $5500.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2F1Y3Rpb24tZGlsZW1tYS1jaGV2cm9sZXQtY2FwcmljZS1wb2xpY2UtcHVyc3VpdC12cy1mb3JkLXBvbGljZS1pbnRlcmNlcHRvci1zZWRhbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Auction Dilemma: Chevrolet Caprice Police Pursuit Vs Ford Police Interceptor Sedan,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2F1Y3Rpb24tZGlsZW1tYS1jaGV2cm9sZXQtY2FwcmljZS1wb2xpY2UtcHVyc3VpdC12cy1mb3JkLXBvbGljZS1pbnRlcmNlcHRvci1zZWRhbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

There are many new and exciting features like Manager Rating Dressing Room Atmosphere Player Growth and much more.

Career Mode remains one of the most exciting features in FIFA games. There are two major types of careers a gamer can pursue in FIFA 22. One is to be a manager while the other is to be a player.

This article highlights some of the most exciting aspects of this year's game. These include some of the best features for the Player Career mode in FIFA 22.

FIFA 22: Rating for manager dressing room atmosphere etc. in all-new Career Mode

1) Coming on as a sub

The option to enter a match from the bench is a new feature in FIFA 22 Player Career. This will deliver the experience of a young prospect who works his way up the ranks to the main lineup.

Players will be able to enter the match as soon as their manager decides to sub them on. This will be displayed in the pre-match launcher where they'll have the option of playing the rest of the match or simulating it.

2) Manager Rating

Manager Rating is a system that assesses a manager's opinion on a player's ability to contribute to the team. The created Pro will begin their career on the bench with the manager giving them a short playing time to impress him.

If the set objectives are met the Pro will begin to get more playing time with the possibility of breaking into the starting lineup.

3) Dynamic tifos

In FIFA 22 players will receive their own tifos if they become one of the team's highest-rated players or a long-term player at the club. Ahead of a crucial match fans will exhibit these player tifos including all players including the player-made Pros.

4) Player growth

The Skill Tree has also had a major overhaul with all new Perks added. Players can have three Perks to use during a match and they will activate whenever specific conditions are met.

5) Dressing room atmosphere

Player Career introduces new dressing room cinematic cutscenes after each match. They reflect the most recent performance of the club and the Pro from trophy victories to a humiliating defeat in a derby.

(October 2nd),"Team of the Week

Our Pick: Zakaria (Mönchengladbach — CDM — 83)

SBCs

Objectives

Hello! You’ve just stepped into the Locker Room: the place where we get to talk all things FIFA 22 once a week. Here we round up all the Ultimate Team news. That includes a list of the Team of the Week cards including our chosen pick the newest SBCs and their requirements as well as the objectives for the week.The headliners of this week’s team of the week are the 86-rated RW version of Gabriel Jesus the 86-rated Jesus Navas and the 84-rated Star Player Lazio’s Felipe Anderson. That makes for a good and diverse set of players certainly compared to last week! We can see Nkunku fitting in nicely with a few Bundesliga squads much like the inclusion of Lukáš Hrádecký in goal. In fact the mix of Hrádecký's good stats tall frame and cheap price makes him the bargain of the week.Sergiño Dest ran him close but Zakaria is just such a filthy boy. You know it we know it. He is verging on Gullit and Goretzka 80-all-round stats here with only his shooting letting him down. Putting him in that CDM role though just to dominate the half-space between midfield and defence we think you could do worse than the Mönchengladbach man. He is currently trading at 40k but we would expect this to tumble.Because this is the start of the year the SBCs are taking their sweet time to role out. Marquee Match-Ups has been present in every FUT and it is back this year. Four leagues eight teams a fair few players to trade-in. The reward has always been a bit incongruent for the four-team investment for me but hey you do you! The Xherdan Shaqiri OTW card SBC just expired so we would expect that another one will arrive this weekend. One to Watch cards upgrade with each inform and in a league like Ligue 1 there are a fair few opportunities for a forward to put up several amazing performances against lower league opponents.There are the ""New Beginning"" Objectives leftover from the start of the week but that is a mundane generic set of challenges. Instead let’s plump for the early announcement of One to Watch Camavinga from Real Madrid. The young CDM should be getting an objective-based card at some point either this weekend or mid-next week depending on EAs new schedule. This young man is a beast so we can see him putting in enough performances to get him upgrades. Though what it will entail we have no idea yet. OTW cards this year don’t rely on in-forms for upgrades but real-life performances. Five wins in ten games will get them a single point increase to reduce the chance of a consistent player missing out on good cards. In addition that reduces the amount of duplicate special cards for sale so it is ultimately a good thing. Next week we will have the full list of objectives for you!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8va2hlbG5vdy5jb20vZm9vdGJhbGwvdG9wLTEwLWRlZmVuZGVycy1maWZhLTIy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 highest rated defenders in EA Sports FIFA 22,"These are the best rated players in the game when it comes to preventing the opposition team from scoring.

FIFA 22 is out now for the general public amidst huge fanfare. The latest offering in a long line of FIFA games from Electronic Arts is massively popular. The fans of the game have been waiting eagerly to get their hands on what the latest edition has to offer. FIFA 22 is out now on all major platforms like PlayStation 5 Xbox Series X and PC.

For the last few weeks people were busy planning and formulating tactics ahead of the release of the game. The announcement of ratings further increased the level of excitement amongst the users who could not wait to play the new edition of the game. Getting a look at the rating before the full release of the game gives a great opportunity to conceptualize squads. The FIFA Ultimate Team and Career Mode are hugely popular where users meticulously pick the best suited players for their teams.

While the attackers take away most of the fame defenders are also very important. Stopping your opponents whether it is an AI controlled team or an online opponent is the key to victory. Having solid defenders in a team with good attributes is vital to any successful squad setup in FIFA 22. Here are the top 10 defenders in the new EA Sports FIFA 22 who possess the highest defensive stats.

10. Raphael Varane - 87

Manchester United’s new signing Raphael Varane has a defence rating of 87 in FIFA 22. His defensive rating and overall rating (86) remains the same from the previous edition. The center-back has moved to the Premier League and is one of the most technical defenders in Europe.

9. N'Golo Kante - 87

The Frenchman is the only midfielder in this list and the only player with an overall rating of 90. The Chelsea star has a defence stat of 87 on his FIFA 22 base card. The 30-year-old had a very successful season with the Blues last year. He was instrumental in the outfit winning the UEFA Champions League. He remains one of the finest players when it comes to doing the defensive work in FIFA 22.

8. Milan Skriniar - 87

The 26-year-old has a 87 defence rating in FIFA 22. The Inter Milan defender had a major hand in the Serie A winning season last term. The Slovakian international also represented his nation at the 2020 UEFA Euros. Skriniar had a defense rating of 87 in FIFA 21 as well but has received a one point boost in his overall rating.

7. Kalidou Koulibaly - 87

Napoli’s towering center-back Kalidou Koulibaly has received a 87 defense stat as well. He is one of the strongest players in the game with a strength rating of 94 as well. He has an overall rating of 86 which has fallen down by two points from FIFA 21.

The Senegalese has been under the radar of several top clubs in the recent times but his price-tag has become an obstacle for his pursuers.

6. Sergio Ramos - 88

Former Real Madrid skipper and current Paris Saint-Germain star Sergio Ramos is next up on the list with 88 defense stat in FIFA 22. He has a defense rating of 88 which is the same as his overall rating. While his defense stats remain the same Ramos’ overall has reduced by one point from the last edition. The Spaniard made headlines by agreeing to join the Ligue 1 outfit after leaving Los Blancos in the summer.

5. Ruben Dias - 88

The Manchester City star has a defence rating of 88 in FIFA 22 making him the second-best defender in the Premier League. The center-back has a 88 defense rating five more than the previous edition. His overall rating has increased by six points as well from 81 to 87.

The Portuguese transformed Manchester City’s backline which already had several expensive signings. Dias signed for the Cityzens from Benfica during the 2020/21 season and helped them to win the Premier League and reach UCL final.

4. Mats Hummels - 89

The German is the highest rated defender in the Bundesliga in FIFA 22. The center-back has a 89 defensive rating with an overall of 86. He has carried the same ratings from the previous edition. Hummels plays a vital role in the heart of Borussia Dortmund’s defense and has been a consistent performer.

3. Marquinhos - 89

Marquinhos' rating increased by 2 points in FIFA 22 (Courtesy: Ligue 1)

The Brazilian ace is the next player in the list having a defense rating of 89. The Brazilian is one of the finest center-backs playing in Europe. The Paris Saint-Germain defender has an overall rating of 87 as well. Both his defense and overall rating has received a two point boost each from the previous edition making him a popular choice in the game.

2. Giorgio Chiellini - 89

Veteran defender Giorgio Chiellini has 89 defense rating on his card in FIFA 22. The 86 overall rated player had a very successful campaign last season. He was at the heart of Italy’s triumph at the 2020 UEFA Euros. The 37-year-old continues to defy age and is one of the best defenders in FIFA 22. However he has lost one point each from his overall and defense stat compared to FIFA 21.

1. Virgil Van Dijk - 91

The Dutchman is yet again the best defender in FIFA 22. He was the best rated defender in FIFA 21 as well and retains his spot at the top. The Liverpool defender is central to the squad and a huge factor in their recent success. He has maintained the defense statistic of 91 but lost one overall point from FIFA 21. It is understandable though as Van Dijk missed out the majority of the previous season due to a knee injury.

Are any disadvantages? Would it really help her credit score?

Experian’s new Boost facility was introduced in the UK in November 2020:

it can increase your Experian Credit Score by a maximum of 101 points;

it is set up so it can never harm your credit score.

Hundreds of thousands of people have used it. Let’s see how it works.

Boost’s idea – making regular payments should help your credit score

A credit score is a summary of your credit repayment history. If you have a good credit history the theory is that you are less likely to default in future.

But at the moment only credit repayments and some utility bills are reported to Experian and the other two Credit Reference Agencies Equifax and Transunion.

The idea behind Boost is that your credit score should be better if you make other regular payments on time. Experian says:

Experian Boost can help you increase your credit score simply by sharing how you manage your money.

It lets you share information about your regular spending such as payments to savings accounts Council Tax payments and digital entertainment payments to the likes of Netflix and Spotify. If you’re making payments like this regularly and not spending more than you earn you could get an instant boost to your credit score.

Experian gets your payment details from your bank

These new payments aren’t reported to the Credit Reference Agencies at the moment. So Experian needs a different way to find out if you have been making them regularly.

Experian uses Open Banking for this. Experian sends you to a page from your bank where you log in and tell your bank to allow Experian access to view your transactions going back up to two years.

If you haven’t used Open Banking before you may wonder if this is safe:

Experian is authorised to provide secure open banking-enabled services;

your banking passwords remain private Experian doesn’t see them;

it can’t make any payments from your account it can only view what has happened;

this permission lasts for three months – after that you have to renew it.

Personally I wouldn’t be concerned about the safety of this but it’s up to you what you feel comfortable with.

Who will gain the most from Boost?

Some people may have little or nothing on their credit record because they don’t have any loans or credit cards at the moment.

You may be in this situation because you are very young and haven’t had any credit. Or because you haven’t been in this country long. Or because you were insolvent with a lot of defaults that have now dropped off your credit records leaving you with little still showing.

These people are currently stuck in a catch-22 dilemma – until they get credit they can’t build up a credit history but it’s hard to get credit with no credit history. As a result they may be turned down for credit from a phone contract to a mortgage even if these contracts would be affordable.

Boost can really help here. Adding some data to your credit record may be enough to enable you to get some credit which will then further help your credit history and score.

If you already have a lot of credit data on your records good or bad then adding the extra Boost data may not make that much extra difference. It can’t harm your credit score but you may not see a 50 point plus jump.

The snag… lenders may ignore it

It’s easy to think that your credit score is a really important number. A whole marketing industry has grown up to convince people that they have to know their score and must then try to improve it.

But really what matters is not the number on your report but whether you can get a credit at a good rate. And increasing your Experian Credit Score doesn’t necessarily mean you are in a better position to get credit.

For a start some lenders check TransUnion or Equifax data not Experian. They aren’t even going to see this Boost information.

But even lenders who use Experian data do not use the Experian Credit Score number that you see. Some only use Experian records others get a score from Experian but this isn’t exactly the same as the one you see.

Experian is providing lenders with the Boost information separately. It’s then up to each lender how they use this. They could ignore it treat it as interesting but less important than credit records or see it as very useful.

The end result is your credit score may go up with Boost but it’s hard to tell how much difference this will make in the real world to your chance of getting credit.

It can only help though not make things worse.

LOQBOX – an alternative

One alternative to Boost if you can afford to save money every month is LOQBOX. This takes your monthly savings and treats these as repayments on a one year no-interest loan.

As an example saving £50 a month is treated as a £600 loan. You don’t get this loan money at the start but at the end of the year you get your savings back. You won’t be rejected for this loan because of poor credit.

This loan is reported to Experian Equifax and TransUnion. It looks just like a normal loan on your credit report and after a few months repaying it improves your credit history. So all lenders will see it and use the information they can’t choose to ignore it.",,,,,,,,,

These women are fighting to keep it alive through online retail.,"CNN —

Many African cultures in the United States have been fighting to keep their traditions and unique way of life alive and now an online retail outlet is helping the Gullah community in Charleston South Carolina use tech to reach a wider audience.

It used to be the only way to purchase one of the exquisite handmade baskets unique to the culture was to physically go to markets in South Carolina. The artists relied on tourists to come see their pieces and some of the weavers told CNN the income was less than steady.

The tradition goes back to the 1700’s when slaves from West Africa were brought to the United States. They were forced to work in rice paddies cotton fields and indigo plantations along the South Carolina-Georgia seaboard where the moist climate and fertile land were very similar to their African homelands.

After the abolition of slavery the Gullah community settled in remote villages around the coastal swath where thanks to their relative isolation they formed strong communal ties and a unique culture that has endured for centuries.

A tradition kept alive for generations to remember where they came from

When the pandemic hit Annie Cayetano-Jefferson a sixth generation Gullah basket weaver explored how to get their products online and then Etsy a popular online retailer stepped in with Nest a nonprofit that cultivates responsible growth and creative engagement of the artisan and maker economy to elevate their platform and exposure.

Cayetano-Jefferson said her family has been making pieces of art and selling them in the Charleston city market for more than 35 years and their family’s unique weaving style has been passed down for generations.

“I have been weaving baskets since I was about five or six years old. We still harvest our own materials. We still dry it. We do everything from start to finish” she said.

“We sell baskets because we want to honor our ancestors and we don’t want to forget where we came from in the past and what those before us have paid for us. We want to just take advantage of what already comes natural.”

For the first time their work isn’t relying on tourists

Each family has their own style of weaving that can be identified by other families. 1212 Design/Nest

Etsy saw the work of 16 women and decided to help build shops on their website via their Uplift Initiative which aims to bring more economic opportunities to creative entrepreneurs.

“We’re really trying to enable renowned but often economically disenfranchised communities to help showcase their work and build an online presence” Dinah Jean Senior Manager of Social Innovation for Etsy told CNN.

“We see it as an opportunity to drive economic resources to the communities by establishing a direct-to-consumer presence that really can help build a pipeline of long-term economic success for the weavers their families and their communities.”

The company provided all of the marketing the weavers need to set up their shops and provided trainers who helped them understand how to build a site and how to manage it effectively with photos and customer service.

The Gullah weavers are the second group Etsy has helped market through online sales. The Gee’s Bend Alabama quilters made $300000 in sales in the first six months. Their quilts are hand-sewn and considered a crucial contribution to the history of American art according to Etsy.

“We believe that crafts play an essential role in a community’s economic and social well-being. And in addition to utilizing that work as a source of income makers are often holding the history of their regions their communities and their families in their work” Jean said.

“We’re really excited for the work that they’ve been able to achieve and we’re excited to incorporate them into the holiday shopping season coming up.”

“For the first time some of these women are getting recognition that they never had before and just seeing the appreciation” Cayetano-Jefferson said. “Some of the ladies that come over here are just so excited that people in California are wanting them to weave their baskets and it’s unreal.”

But the beautiful baskets are not without their challenges.

Obstacles have slowed the interest in the craft

The sweetgrass used in the baskets is native to the South and Cayetano-Jefferson said that the harvest is harder now because some of the areas they have been going to for decades are no longer accessible due to land purchase or development.

“My grandmother would go and pull grass and we’re still going to the exact same spot but now when we get there there’s a fence up and it’s private property– so we we’re dealing with that here as far as continuing our craft” she said.

Vera Mae Manigault an eighth-generation weaver mentioned wild animals like snakes and wild boar as a danger to harvesting as well.

Also similar to her daughter’s feelings about sharing sewing baskets with the next generation Cayetano-Jefferson said it is losing steam in the community because of the obstacles.

“I feel like the community itself is losing the drive to do it. The drive is lost because of the obstacles that are put on sweetgrass basket weaving. It is the South Carolina state craft but there are no places for us to go and freely harvest so the community themselves is losing the drive to be able to get the products” she said.

Weavers hope recognition will inspire the next generation

The baskets come in all shapes and sizes with unique patterns. 1212 Design/Nest

Cayetano-Jefferson’s daughter Chelsea Cayetano has shared in the tradition of her family while in college. Cayetano said she hopes the younger Gullah generations would see the items online and get inspired to learn to sew their own baskets.

“I want to show and inform more young women and men that it’s like cool. It’s not an old lady job and only older ladies do it and it’s not just for girls either” she said. “So much more can come out of making the baskets and you meet so many new people and you can even end up traveling because of it I love that.”

All the women have hope the online platform can show the nation and the world the beauty and love poured into every basket made.

“When someone sees our products I want them to think of how strong our culture is because there have been so many setbacks” Cayetano said. “It’s showing how strong our community is and how even if we do fall down we get back up and we get ten times better.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjEvb2N0LzAxL3Jpc2Utb2YtdGhlLWhvbG1pZXMtdGhlLW1lcmNoLWluc3BpcmVkLWJ5LXRoZS10aGVyYW5vcy1naXJsYm9zc9IBcmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjEvb2N0LzAxL3Jpc2Utb2YtdGhlLWhvbG1pZXMtdGhlLW1lcmNoLWluc3BpcmVkLWJ5LXRoZS10aGVyYW5vcy1naXJsYm9zcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rise of the Holmies: the merch inspired by the Theranos ‘girlboss’,"There are posters stickers and coffee mugs flags T-shirts and masks – all celebrating Silicon Valley “girl boss” Elizabeth Holmes.

The fraud case of the Theranos founder has given way to a burgeoning cottage industry for merchandise venerating the disgraced CEO.

As Holmes stands trial in a California courthouse hundreds of listings have sprung up across online marketplaces including Etsy and Redbubble catering to “Holmies” – the name used by some followers of the former executive.

One shop called “We Are Elizabeth Holmes” has 26 products sporting original designs of the founder’s stenciled image. Some feature a favorite quote of Holmes: “First they think you’re crazy then they fight you then you change the world.”

Some vendors and customers seem to earnestly support the former founder but many are embracing the in-between.

Many listings appear ironic. A common refrain – “gaslight gatekeep girlboss” – pokes fun at a wave of feminism that encouraged women to succeed within capitalism.

“To be clear we don’t condone any criminal activity but we’re tickled that she was able to get so far on a lie in an industry so heavily dominated by men” a representative from one shop said. “She’s oozes femme fatale energy and who doesn’t like a good villain origin story?”

Summer  the vendor behind Etsy shop TheTrendyVegan said she sells her Holmes T-shirts to “do a small part in opening up this conversation” around the complicated legacy of the founder.

The TrendyVegan shirts say “they hate to see a girl boss winning” with a picture of Holmes and “money over everything”. Summer said she is hoping Holmes will be found not guilty in the trial citing reports about Holmes’s planned defense that she was a victim of domestic violence and was swayed into her role as a defrauder by her ex-business partner and former lover Sonny Balwani. Balwani has strongly denied that accusation.

“We need to learn to stop seeing people – and especially women – in only black or white” she said. “In my opinion Elizabeth isn’t a hero or a villain but a complex and unique woman. She fought to get to achieve the levels of success she did and she endured a lot of hardship along the way including potential domestic abuse.”

Lauren Kreiser a comedian who purchased a Holmes shirt from Etsy said her choice to wear the founder’s face is part tongue-in-cheek but also a testament to the irresistible intrigue of the Theranos scam.

“She herself is really fascinating; it is hard to tell what exactly is going on there and what her psychology is” she said adding that she has published an online sketch in which she plays Holmes has seen the Theranos documentary read the book Bad Blood and is still listening to podcasts on the trial.

Dozens of people have flocked to the San Jose courtroom where Holmes is standing trial for defrauding clients and investors. Multiple TV series and movies chronicling the company are in production. Three women outside the courthouse in the first days of the trial were speculated to be “cosplaying” Holmes dressed similarly to the founder and identifying themselves as “fans”.

Many people are fascinated with Holmes regardless of whether they believe she is guilty said Edward Balleisen a professor at Duke university who wrote the book Fraud: An American History from Barnum to Madoff. Those who believe Holmes meant to defraud people may see her as a hero for “sticking it to the man” and misleading rich investors while others still think of her as a Silicon Valley success story.

“It is not surprising in a culture that celebrates people overcoming limitations to succeed that this story has been captivating for so many people – even if it wasn’t true” Balleisen said.

Laura Gallaher organizational psychologist and expert in company culture and its impacts said it was unsurprising Holmes’s cult following had outlasted the Theranos company itself.

“Even though her device didn’t do what it said it would do people are still holding on to this hero narrative because they wanted her to succeed” she said. “People still want to believe.”

The move will result in ""the most complete travel rewards offering in the industry"" according to the Seattle-based firm with member discounts and reward earning and redemption on flights hotels vacation rentals car rentals cruises and activities across all Expedia Group brands.

Travel brands impacted include Expedia Hotels.com Orbitz Travelocity and Vrbo.

The step addresses on a corporate level a problem that has plagued consumer loyalty efforts. Ever since American Airlines in 1981 became the first major company to roll out a loyalty program its AAdvantage frequent flyer plan travel suppliers and others have debuted scores of similar schemes in an effort to cultivate consumer fealty to their brands.

Trouble is while some consumers do stick to one airline hotel chain or car rental firm to rack up reward points as intended many others over time sign up with multiple companies ending up with lots of low points balances in a multitude of competing loyalty programs.

Nowadays companies often address this by partially partnering with compatible programs from other firms. Expedia Group is applying the model to its vast array of sometimes competing brands with more than 145 million loyalty program members in total.

""I have a stack of logins and loyalty cards and soon it just won't be necessary because I'm going to earn benefits whether I'm renting a car booking a flight or reserving a hotel room"" said Jon Gieselman president of Expedia Brands.

All four existing main programs across Expedia Group brands will join the brand-new global rewards program he noted. An exact launch date has not been set but a company spokesperson said rollout is expected ""within the coming year.""

""Our loyalty program will offer members the opportunity to earn and redeem points across all Expedia Group brands even those brands like Vrbo that didn't have loyalty programs before"" Gieselman said.

""A customer will be able to earn points for their Vrbo vacation rental and redeem it on an Expedia car rental for example"" he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb3lhbHR5LWFuZC1yZXdhcmRzLW5ld3MvMjAyMS9leHBlZGlhLWNvbWJpbmVzLWNvbnN1bWVyLXJld2FyZHMtcHJvZ3JhbXMtYWNyb3NzLXRyYXZlbC1idXNpbmVzc2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Expedia Combines Consumer Rewards Programs Across Travel Businesses,"Expedia Group is looking into expanding its customer loyalty program CNBC writes which will make it “the most complete travel rewards offering.”

The expansion will consist of things like member discounts reward earning and redemption on flights hotels vacation rentals car rentals cruises and various activities.

The new updates will address a corporate-level problem with loyalty programs: the way customers tend to sign up with multiple companies and end up only accumulating a small number of points in each one.

Companies have tried to address this by partnering with compatible programs through other firms and Expedia Group has been applying the model to its own vast array of competing brands. Jon Gieselman Expedia Brands president said it won’t be necessary to have multiple logins and loyalty cards “because I’m going to earn benefits whether I’m renting a car booking a flight or reserving a hotel room.”

Gieselman gave examples saying the new program will offer members a way to earn and redeem points across every Expedia Group brand. That will include ones like Vrbo which didn’t have a loyalty program before.

He said customers will be able to earn points on their Vrbo vacation rentals and then use them on a car rental from Expedia for example.

“It’s better for travelers and there’s an added benefit of making our partners’ inventory more visible to new customers for future bookings” Gieselman said. “It’s going to be simpler and more flexible.”

Expedia senior vice president and general manager Shiv Singh told PYMNTS recently that travel is likely to see some changes as the pandemic eventually recedes – he said travel will become “a more conscious act.” That means it won’t be taken for granted so much and that people will likely want to “pack more” into their trips.

Expedia is responding by streamlining operations and making it easier to track itineraries.

It comes with plenty of fantastic features especially for those using Microsoft apps. It isn't perfect however so we'll break down the full service to help you decide if it's right for you.

As a leading brand in the tech space Microsoft puts its fingers in many digital pies. One of those pies is cloud storage with Microsoft offering the world OneDrive. The software has evolved a lot over the years. As features advance we want to keep you up to speed — and that’s exactly what we’re going to do in this extensive OneDrive review. Key Takeaways: OneDrive is a fast and reliable cloud storage solution.

It’s the perfect option for those already using other Microsoft apps.

Privacy is where OneDrive drops the ball with the lack of zero-knowledge encryption.

Overall Microsoft OneDrive is a good choice for both students and professionals. In a world filled with options for cloud storage what makes OneDrive an attractive option for consumers? It has plenty of useful features which we will get into; however the main selling point is the level of integration. Services like Office Skype OneNote and Outlook are integrated into the OneDrive platform. This allows you to create documents and have team calls without having to leave OneDrive. Although Microsoft OneDrive has fast reliable performance and plenty of features it does have a major flaw: privacy. The service is lacking zero-knowledge encryption which opens the door to unwanted access. That said Microsoft is slowly implementing features that make accounts more secure and man-in-the-middle attacks more difficult (more on that later). Despite its flaws OneDrive still makes it onto our list of best cloud storage services and there are plenty of reasons why. Let’s take a look. Show all Meet the experts Learn more about our editorial team and our research process.

Strengths & Weaknesses Pros: Office 365 integration

Good document collaboration

Large variety of features

Fast file syncing Cons: No zero-knowledge security

Limited file versioning

Limited customer support

Features 90 % – Excellent If you use Office tools such as Word and Excel you’ll appreciate having the ability to create and edit documents directly in OneDrive which automatically saves those files to the cloud. Gaining access to these productivity tools make OneDrive one of the best cloud storage for students and professionals. There’s one slight downside: the number of tools at your disposal depends on the plan you’re on: the more you pay the more you get. You’ll need a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family subscription to be able to download Office and use it with OneDrive on your PC but standard OneDrive users have free access to the mobile and web apps. Similar services are available if you’re using another operating system such as macOS with OneDrive for Mac users getting a similar experience. If you’re a business user you can combine OneDrive with other Microsoft tools like Microsoft SharePoint to become a one-stop shop for all of your essential business documents. It’s also why OneDrive is one of the top recommendations on our best cloud storage for collaboration short list. Read our SharePoint vs OneDrive guide to learn how the two differ. Aiming to separate itself from the pack OneDrive offers what it calls a “personal vault.” You can add your most precious files to your vault and access them only with a unique code or your fingerprint. It’s an extra step for you but an added layer of security when fending off cyberattacks. Free OneDrive users as well as users with 100GB of storage space can save up to three files in their personal vault. You’ll need to purchase a better subscription to store more files up to your standard space limit. Microsoft OneDrive PC Backups To keep your files safe and updated OneDrive allows you to automatically backup your desktop folders documents and pictures. While it’s a great feature it doesn’t provide a full system backup. Those looking to backup everything on their system should consider Backblaze which you can learn more about in our full Backblaze review. Beyond automatic backups you can also sync and share files from your desktop by simply adding them to your OneDrive folder. Doing so allows you to access your files on different devices as long as you have access to your OneDrive account. File Restore If you do lose access to your account you can take advantage of OneDrive’s “files restore” recovery feature. This was previously limited to OneDrive for Business users but it’s now been expanded to all users with a paid OneDrive or Microsoft 365 subscription. OneDrive Files on Demand OneDrive’s “files on-demand” allows users to keep files in the cloud to free up space on their hard drive. This gives you the option to download and access files only when you need them which you can do through the desktop app. It’s a valuable feature especially if you find that you’re jumping between devices a lot while you’re working (such as between home and work). With OneDrive’s files-on-demand feature you can edit files from your PC as if they were stored locally picking up where you left off on another device with ease. Real-Time Collaboration All OneDrive subscribers can take advantage of document collaboration — after all it’s OneDrive’s winning feature. However other services such as Google Drive and Google Docs offer similar collaboration features as our Google Drive review will explain. Using OneDrive you and your collaborators can edit a compatible document together in real time. Any changes you make will be seen immediately by everyone looking at the file. It’s a great tool for reviewing documents or going over notes and you can keep track of what edits are made and by whom. Features like these make OneDrive a sensible cloud storage solution for document creation whether it’s for work or school. Built-In Image Scanner Lastly a cool feature we like is the built-in image scanner. Users simply tap the camera tab to scan documents business cards and photos. This feature is not unique to OneDrive but it’s good that Microsoft recognizes the usefulness of this simple feature.

Ease of Use 90 % – Excellent The best word to describe OneDrive is “polished.” For Windows users OneDrive aims to edge past its cloud storage competition by having it preinstalled on your computer. While there’s nothing to prevent you from installing a different provider having it ready to go makes it easier to get set up. On both Windows and MacOS operating systems Microsoft OneDrive exists as a folder on your computer. You’ll be prompted to log in with your Microsoft account on first use but from there you can upload files simply by adding or saving them to your OneDrive folder. Like Dropbox and other major cloud storage services OneDrive uses a single-sync directory with its own subfolders and files on Windows PCs. The contents of this directory are then stored online and require no extra effort to backup. Your OneDrive files automatically take up space on your hard drive. However this is where you can implement the files-on-demand feature and select which files you want to exist only in the cloud. The downside is that if you lose your internet connection you won’t be able to access any files that you haven’t set up to be accessible offline. The OneDrive web app is a good option for those who don’t wish to use the desktop app. The web user interface is simple and easy to navigate and it will offer no surprises to Microsoft users. You can drag files onto the page to upload them and download files you need by right-clicking the file. You can also use the web interface to quickly change your settings start Skype calls and access OneDrive’s help menu. Like other Microsoft web products you can easily access other services like Office 365 or Outlook from the top-left menu icon. OneDrive Mobile Cloud Storage Solution OneDrive for mobile is available on Android and iOS. It comes with most of the features included in the web and desktop applications. However Microsoft has done well to keep it as simple as possible for mobile users. You can quickly view your recent files or see a full overview of your stored files and folders allowing you to download files for an offline view. Additionally the mobile apps for OneDrive give you the option to automatically upload the photos and videos that you take. This is handy especially if you lose your phone because your content will be safely backed up for you to restore elsewhere. You can also switch to the “shared” tab to set up or view content you’ve shared with other OneDrive users.

File Sharing & Sync 85 % – Very Good File syncing and sharing is important for any cloud storage provider and it’s something that OneDrive does particularly well (though we do have a guide for if OneDrive is not syncing). The sync folder functions similarly to Dropbox offering a specific location for files and folders on your hard drive that are synced with Microsoft’s servers. If you’re curious check out our Dropbox review to learn a little more about how that service works and the similarities it shares with OneDrive. If you have a file that exists outside the locations that OneDrive natively selects you can right-click on that file and click the “move to OneDrive” option. This works only with files though. If you want to move a folder you will need to manually cut and paste that folder into the sync location that’s automatically created with OneDrive. Sharing a file in OneDrive is as easy as right-clicking on the file and pressing “share” to get started. From there OneDrive will open a menu allowing you to select who you want to share your files with or you can copy the link to your clipboard to share elsewhere. The web application also has the same sharing functionality. You can create shareable links and add user permissions and Premium users can set link expiration dates for added security. Some may prefer Google Drive for sharing files especially if they use Google’s productivity tools. However OneDrive works perfectly well as a solution for file and folder sharing.

Speed 90 % – Excellent OneDrive has impressive upload and download speeds. Although it doesn’t perform as well as Dropbox its performance times are nothing to scoff at. We uploaded a 5GB unzipped folder filled with various file types. Our internet speed was 100 Mbps from a virtual Windows machine based in Ireland. Overall our experience with the speed of syncing files was very positive as indicated by the data transfer times below. 1st attempt: 2nd attempt: Average: Upload 0:09:25 0:09:00 0:09:12 Download 0:07:20 0:07:18 0:07:19 OneDrive does support block-level file copying (which it calls “differential sync”) to make it easier to quickly edit files without fully uploading them again. It was once reserved only for Microsoft Office file types such as DOCX but it now supports all file types. However it is only available to those on a business plan.

Security 70 % – Decent To keep your files safe OneDrive uses 256-bit encryption both in transit and at rest. Unfortunately OneDrive loses points because it is not a zero-knowledge provider meaning it can access users’ encryption keys; OneDrive employees middle-men and the authorities all have the potential to view your files. In the event of a data breach OneDrive has an automated notification service to alert you which is a useful feature. Once notified you can use any connected device to restore compromised files change your password and activate additional OneDrive security features. The addition of two-factor authentication also helps keep your data secured from unauthorized logins. It’s a nice inclusion and — as with all of the features of OneDrive — it’s easy to set up and use especially if you’re already using the Microsoft Authenticator app to secure your account. Microsoft is slowly implementing passwordless access to user accounts across all its platforms. Rather than input a password (that hackers can potentially access) users can log in with a unique code each time they access their account. The long term goal is to move away from passwords and two-step authentication. How well it will work is yet to be determined. We briefly covered OneDrive’s personal vault feature earlier in this review offering a way for users to add extra security and protection to their files. It’s a nice idea but don’t be fooled: it doesn’t encrypt your files. However it can add additional layers of protection such as two-factor authentication to sensitive documents to stop hackers from gaining access to them so easily.

Privacy 70 % – Decent Ideas like the OneDrive personal vault are clever but they mask a fairly middling focus on privacy from one of the world’s largest technology firms. Microsoft talks a big talk but the truth is a little murkier. U.S.-based firms have a distinct disadvantage when it comes to privacy. Companies like Microsoft have a legal requirement to engage with law enforcement if asked to do so with laws like the CLOUD Act making it impossible for a U.S. service to refuse the request. If the United States government wants your data it’s going to get it. With that in mind you need to remember that it doesn’t matter what features OneDrive has to help keep your data private because Microsoft will hand it all over if the law directs it to do so. You have some control over your data though with the Microsoft privacy dashboard letting you view and clear certain content such as your browsing data. However for OneDrive users there isn’t a huge amount to offer here. You could delete your account but Microsoft will keep your data for up to 180 days. The options are pretty limited for direct control over your data but you can opt out of some Microsoft privacy tracking including the ability to stop personalized ads across your account. You may be able to tweak your Windows 10 privacy settings to further limit this level of data tracking. Overall if you’re really worried about privacy you probably don’t want to host your data with services that are based in one of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing nations such as the United States.

Customer Service 70 % – Decent OneDrive has an underwhelming support service for its users. There’s a general support line but getting to the right person for a quick solution is cumbersome. There’s also no live chat which is disappointing considering other cloud storage providers offer this feature. Users can access community forums and check out how-to articles. However if the answer you’re looking for isn’t there your only option is to email OneDrive. Response times were fairly quick but took longer than two hours. That’s no good for anyone needing immediate support. The company’s community forums offer a useful resource for users. This vault of question-and-answer posts covers a number of unusual queries and issues but it isn’t as active as you might think. However it is staffed by helpful support agents and volunteers with relatively quick response times. If the forum doesn’t help Microsoft does offer a chatbot that can guide you to common answers support articles or links to different parts of the site that you may have missed. If this doesn’t answer your query you can request to speak to a live support agent but you may need to wait in a queue before you can speak to someone.

The Verdict As far as cloud storage goes there’s little to complain about with Microsoft OneDrive. The price is reasonable the performance is impressive and the ease of using Microsoft apps makes it an attractive choice. When it comes to finding a space to store your files sync collaborate and share OneDrive hangs with the best of them. It’s an ideal option for students professionals and business users. Privacy and customer support are the two areas that make us consider looking elsewhere. If you want only the best privacy for your files OneDrive isn’t for you; you should instead check out pCloud Sync.com Icedrive or MEGA all which rank about OneDrive in our best cloud storage article. However if you don’t mind potential eyes on your files and just need a reliable fast feature-stacked cloud service OneDrive gives you everything you need.

Beyond cloud storage OneDrive also excels at document creation and collaboration plus it’s pretty affordable.

What Are the Disadvantages of Using OneDrive? The main disadvantage of using OneDrive is the lack of privacy. While your files are kept safe through encryption that lack of zero-knowledge means Microsoft can access and share your data should it deem it justifiable.

Which Is Better: Dropbox or OneDrive? For those already familiar with the Microsoft ecosystem OneDrive is the way to go especially if you use Office.

According to the deadline established in Limón’s legislation public access to Hollister Ranch’s beaches—which enjoy quasi-mythical status among surfers worldwide—needs to be established in some limited form no later than April 1 2022.” There’s a lot more in the Independent article about how complicated this process is going to be as anyone who’s been to Hollister Ranch can imagine.

The statement was made during the 17th Interregional Cooperation Forum of Kazakhstan and Russia held online on Thursday.

“We start developing the large Kalamkas-Sea and Khazar fields” President Tokayev said. “The strategic partner from the Russian side has been identified - this is Lukoil. The total project cost will be about $5 billion.”

Kalamkas-Sea is an offshore field discovered in 2002 and located in the northeastern part of the Caspian Sea near the giant Kashagan field — one of the world’s largest discoveries of the past four decades.

In 2013 North Caspian Operating Company N.V. (NCOC) — Kashagan’s operator — announced a commercial discovery at Kalamkas-Sea. Geological reserves at the oil field were reportedly estimated at about 150 million tons of oil and 15 billion cubic meters of gas. However in 2019 NCOC including energy giants such as Eni Shell ExxonMobil Total CNPC Inpex and KazMunayGas all pulled out of the Kalamkas-Sea project.

Discovered in 2007 Khazar is also located next to the Kashagan field. The Caspi Meruerty Operating Company BV operates Khazar under a production sharing agreement which includes KazMunayGas and Oman Pearls Company Limited. In 2019 the British-Dutch oil and gas conglomerate Shell scaled back its oil and gas exploration plans for Khazar due to “the low profitability of these projects against the background of high capital expenditures.” Before the withdrawal Shell had invested about $900 million in the project.

Meanwhile the Kazakh president believes it is also vital to facilitate the development of two gas fields Khvalynskoye and Imashevskoye. Both are major joint projects with Russia.

“It is important to solve the commercial issues with Gazprom as soon as possible” President Tokayev said referring to Russia’s energy giant.

The oil and gas industries are the main pillars for Moscow and Nur-Sultan as both Russia and Kazakhstan are flush with hydrocarbons. The two post-Soviet countries have maintained strong partnerships in the energy sector through already existing close economic technological and transportation initiatives.

The project in Kazakhstan will not be a first for Lukoil which has been involved there since 1995.

Together with Rosneft the company has been responsible for exploring the Tengiz oil and gas field which ranks as the world’s deepest supergiant oil field. In addition Lukoil is responsible for exploring the Karachaganak (13.5 percent) and Zhenis block (50 percent). Reportedly Lukoil is planning to invest about $350 million in exploration at the Zhenis block over 7-9 years.

Earlier this year Lukoil signed a sales and purchase (SPA) agreement with KazMunayGas to acquire a 49.99 percent stake in the charter capital of Al-Farabi Operating LLP a joint venture to develop an offshore block located in Kazakhstan’s portion of the Caspian Sea. According to Lukoil’s data recoverable resources at the Al-Farabi block are estimated at 15.1 million tons.

Lukoil is also a member of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium through which the crude oil is transported.",,,,,,,,,

(AP) — Tesla says it delivered 241300 electric vehicles in the third quarter even as it wrestled with a global shortage of computer chips that has hit the entire auto industry.

The Palo Alto California company’s sales from July through September beat Wall Street estimates of 227000 sales worldwide according to data provider FactSet.

Third-quarter sales rose 72% over the 140000 deliveries Tesla made for the same period a year ago.

So far this year Tesla has sold around 627300 vehicles. That puts it on pace to soundly beat last year’s total of 499550.

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note to investors that the pace of electric vehicle deliveries in the U.S. and China has been strong for the past month or so. That means an “eye-popping growth trajectory heading into 4Q and 2022 for (CEO Elon) Musk & Co.”

[ns-video id=”5bf09c8b6f5a8f2801cfc51080c54a2″ publisher=”21905″]

Still Ives estimated that the chip shortage will knock 40000 vehicles from Tesla’s annual delivery number. He estimates the deliveries to be at least 865000 vehicles with a bull case of around 900000.

“In a nutshell with chip shortage headwinds China demand still recovering from earlier this year and EV competition coming from all angles Tesla’s ability to navigate these challenges this quarter has been very impressive” he wrote.

In the third quarter the smaller Model 3 sedan and Y SUV led the way with 232025 sales followed by the larger Models S and X at 9275. Tesla said it produced 237823 vehicles for the quarter.",,,,,,,,,

The win marked the second highest margin of victory in a top-25 matchup in KSU's history and moved head coachinto second-place all-time in Big South Conference career victories.Kennesaw State won by controlling the ground owning the clock and winning the turnover battle.KSU outgained JSU by a 271-71 margin in rushing offense held the football for 37:19 of game clock and forced two turnovers while committing none.Quarterbackhad 32 attempts on the ground for 124 yards – the most the sophomore quarterback has ever totaled in his career. He also completed 5-of-6 passes for 72 yards.The Owls (3-1) surprised the Jacksonville State (2-3) defense on the first play of the game with an 18-yard pass down the field. Shepherd connected with slot backon a wide-open pass that moved the ball to the middle of the field. Eight plays later Adeleke would break off a 32-yard run finding the back of the end zone for the Owls' first score of the day. The opening drive went 75 yards on nine plays and took 4:48 off the clock. This marked the second time this season Kennesaw State scored a touchdown on its first possession of the game.Jacksonville State attempted to answer the Owls' score but was stopped on third down after junior defensive backbroke-up a pass in the end zone. On the next play with the ball on eight-yard line senior defensive tacklebroke through the JSU offensive line and blocked the Gamecock field goal attempt. The ball was recovered byand returned 24 yards to the 50-yard line.Shepherd and the offense continued to use the ground game to move the ball down field during the second possession. On the 11play Shepherd kept the ball on the option and found the end zone with a 16-yard touchdown run. This marked the first of three rushing touchdowns the quarterback would have in the game and was the first time the Owls had a quarterback hit the three-touchdown mark since(Feb. 28 2021 vs. Shorter).Jacksonville State found itself down 14-0 after the first two drives of the game – the exact opposite of what happened in 2018 when the Gamecocks led by 14 in the first half. JSU carried the ball down the field again on its second possession but was stopped on a fourth down rush attempt by senior linebacker. Thompson finished with four tackles (three solo) and one pass break-up.The Kennesaw State defense allowed only 134 total yards in the first half. The blocked field goal and the fourth down stop were big moments in the game but an interception late in the second quarter was the defining play of the half. Thompson dropped back into coverage and was able to get a hand on a pass from JSU quarterback Zerrick Cooper. The deflection looked as if it would fall harmlessly to the ground until Singletary came flying in from the safety position to make a diving catch. The hustle and awareness on this play led the Owls into halftime with a 17-0 lead.After deferring in the first half Jacksonville State got the ball to start the third quarter. Four plays later Owls' cornerbacklet his presence be known with the second interception of the day for the Kennesaw State defense. Shepherd and the offense took the field and looked to blow the game wide open with another score. On a third and seven Shepherd was able to find receiverfor a 14-yard reception which kept the chains moving. At the end of a seven-play 38-yard drive Shepherd punched the ball in for a two-yard score and extended the lead to 24-0.Later in the third quarter Jacksonville State scored its lone touchdown of the day and would fail the two-point conversion attempt. At 24-6 the Owls' offense answered and put together a long drive that took 8:53 off the clock. This 15-play 75-yard drive was finished with Shepherd's third rushing touchdown of the day – a one-yard score.Other offensive notables included running back who carried 14 times for 60 yards to surpass the 1000-yard mark for his career.The game wrapped up the 2021 non-conference regular season schedule for the Owls. Kennesaw State moves to 3-0 all-time against JSU is 9-1 against teams from the state of Alabama and has won 15 consecutive non-conference FCS games.

Now he’s an apostate convinced that one of the fastest growth areas in financing is a sham. “It’s clear to me now” he writes in a recent three-part essay in Medium that my work “only made matters worse by leading the world into a dangerous mirage an oasis in the middle of the desert that is burning valuable time.”



So-called ESG (environmental social and governance) investing Fancy argues merely allows fund managers to charge higher fees for investment products that have “scant or little evidence of real-world impact that would not have otherwise occurred.” So what if these funds divest themselves of big-time polluters like oil companies? Other investors will happily step in leaving the companies themselves no worse off. As Fancy points out “10% of the market not buying your stock is not the same as 10% of your customers not buying your product.”



Besides he notes green assets are just a drop in the ocean set against the $360 trillion of global wealth operating in a business-as-usual way.



Fancy’s argument draws on a sports metaphor. Wall Street is focused on scoring points (maximizing profits) not good sportsmanship (being a responsible investor.) To save the planet you have to change the rules of the game. Ultimately that means forcing companies to alter their ways by taxing their carbon emissions.



Fancy a Canadian born to parents who emigrated from Kenya turned whistle-blower to spark public debate. In that spirit I invited him to join a panel on this week’s edition of Bloomberg New Economy Conversations along with Anne Simpson the director for Board Governance & Sustainability at CalPERS the California Public Employees System. Also on the show was Noel Quinn the Group Chief Executive of HSBC.



The funds that Simpson represents are anything but trivial: close to $500 billion in CalPERS and another $55 trillion (with a “t”) as part of a group that CalPERS helped form called Climate Action 100+ which describes itself as “an investor-led initiative to ensure the world’s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters take necessary action on climate change.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYW5zcG9ydGFuZGxvZ2lzdGljc21lLmNvbS9zbWFydC1sb2dpc3RpY3MvZHAtd29ybGQtdXBzLWJyaW5nLXdvcmxkcy1maXJzdC1zb2xhci1wb3dlci1jaGFyZ2VkLWV2cy10by1leHBvLTIwMjDSAYYBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHJhbnNwb3J0YW5kbG9naXN0aWNzbWUuY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9zbWFydC1sb2dpc3RpY3MvZHAtd29ybGQtdXBzLWJyaW5nLXdvcmxkcy1maXJzdC1zb2xhci1wb3dlci1jaGFyZ2VkLWV2cy10by1leHBvLTIwMjA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DP World UPS Bring World's First Solar Power Charged EVs to Expo 2020,"From the x-ray machine to the telephone throughout history world expos have been the home for inventions and technology that change our way of life.

Expo 2020 Dubai is no exception. As the Official Premier Global Trade Partner of Expo 2020 DP World is working with UPS the Official Logistics Partner to showcase transition to clean energy sources with UPS’ electrical vehicles being charged for the first time with an off-grid charging system to power on-site deliveries.

Abdulla Bin Damithan CEO and Managing Director DP World - UAE Region and Jafza said: “DP World is proud to work with UPS demonstrating the next generation of delivery vehicles at Expo 2020 Dubai.

""We are committed to digital and technological innovation that makes supply chains smarter and more sustainable. The DP World FLOW pavilion has been designed to demonstrate the future of global trade increasing prosperity while reducing the use of energy and resources.

""The collaboration between UPS and DP World addresses sustainability issues and is closely aligned with the UAE’s Circular Economy Policy 2021-2031 and its Green Agenda 2030.”

Scott Price president of UPS international said: “Today’s deployment of one of the world’s first off-grid electric vehicle charging systems is a demonstration of how Expo 2020 is connecting minds and creating the future.

Maersk Partners with Danish Pavilion for Dubai Expo 2020

“Our joint efforts allow us to decentralize the charging system eliminate the need for electricity in charging vehicles at Expo 2020 and further our goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050.”

During the six-month mega event UPS will use the system to charge its fleet of electric vehicles developed in collaboration with Arrival at DP World’s FLOW Pavilion.

Sunlight will be captured by panels on the pavilion’s roof with the solar energy flowing through an inverter to an off-grid Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) unit which powers the charging station.

The sustainable collaboration is closely aligned with the UAE’s Circular Economy Policy 2021-2031 and its Green Agenda 2030 as well as supporting a key growth engine of Dubai’s economy through the development of cutting-edge circular economy technologies.

Avinash Rugoobur president of Arrival said: “It’s truly special to be at Expo 2020 with UPS and DP World showcasing how innovation and collaboration can accelerate the transition to electric vehicles globally.

“Arrival is pioneering a new method of design and production for electric vehicles that is truly sustainable - from our recyclable composite panels to the local Microfactories used for production.

""The development of sustainable charging options is a welcome addition to this ecosystem that will increase the impact we can have as we bring cleaner transportation to cities around the world.""

UPS’s journey toward a less carbon-intensive future is enabled through one of the industry’s largest private alternative fuel and advanced technology fleets and a ‘rolling laboratory’ of more than 13000 vehicles that drive more than 1 million greener miles each business day.

Ancestral beer is a new unpasteurized alcohol from once upon a time when Egyptians transformed malt and yeast into humanity’s first booze.

Did you know beer is basically liquid cereal?

""I can make a beer out of rice out of wheat and quinoa"" Florencia Juárez Marrades a 26-year-old Argentinian expert in ancestral beer told Vice.

The sugars in types of fungi like yeast convert into beer through the chemical process of fermentation.

""Some dogs are bloodhounds others are guard dogs. Yeasts are similarly varied"" Juárez added. ""If we want to ferment alcohol the type of yeast used has to be one that thrives in very sugary environments.""

Homebrewing across the world has exploded in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Our industry in a recession does well because not as many people are working people are more cost-conscious and they have time on their hands"" David Stuart national sales manager for Ohio-based LD Carlson a wholesale distributor of beer- and winemaking supplies told The Associated Press.

Raw beer perhaps best left to the professionals omits the modern pasteurization process.

""If you want to sell something on a large scale you’ve got to have a standard flavor that’s replicable from one bottle to the next"" Juárez said. ""Whereas with a wild beer no two are ever the same.""

Her quest: to bring the old world into modern times.

""We’ve brought flavors that were being left behind back to life"" she said.

Ancestral beer is determined by the type of yeast used as the main ingredient.

""We only use wild yeasts cultivated from ingredients you have in the house"" Juárez explained.

Following the first 10 songs of his final ""Friends & Heroes"" tour stop at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee Saturday Shelton stepped offstage and country music veteran John Anderson emerged from below it. There was an instant surge of energy from the near-capacity crowd as Anderson with Shelton's seven-piece backing band crooned through a soft ""Seminole Wind"" followed by a boisterous ""Money in the Bank"" and the boot-scootin' ""Swingin'"" all huge country hits in the '80s and '90s.

And Shelton half-jokingly was just a touch jealous.

""Why do you all act so different for John Anderson?"" Shelton asked. ""I've been out here for 40 minutes and all of a sudden John Anderson comes out here and the whole damn crowd … is line-dancing and (expletive). How do you line-dance in your seats?""

""The last thing I need is to wake up tomorrow morning and read the Wisconsin Post or whatever you have here and the headline says something like 'John Anderson steals the show'"" Shelton continued.

Here at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel we don't take headline suggestions from people we're writing about. But that wouldn't have been an appropriate headline anyway — because Anderson wasn't the only one to steal the spotlight from Shelton.

RELATED:These are the 15 must-see Milwaukee concerts this fall

RELATED:Here are all the Milwaukee entertainment venues groups shows that require masks proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test

And that's the beauty of the concept of Shelton's ""Friends & Heroes"" tour which has been around for a few years but stopped in Milwaukee for the first time Saturday.

It gives Shelton a chance to share his sharp band and packed houses with veteran country stars who prove they've still got the goods and are still beloved.

On Saturday that included Martina McBride who with her sparkling voice brightened the night with the self-assuring gems ""My Baby Loves Me"" and ""This One's for the Girls"" before closing out with the shattering and soaring ""A Broken Wing.""

And the show also included Tracy Byrd who actually got the strongest reaction of the three ""Friends & Heroes"" Saturday. He took full advantage of the runway tipping his black cowboy hat and high-fiving any fans he could reach hyping up the crowd with his magnetic stage presence and '90s and early-aughts party-starters ""Ten Rounds With Jose Cuervo"" ""I'm From the Country"" and ""Watermelon Crawl.""

""Over and over again tonight I have had my ass handed to me by these other singers coming"" Shelton said near the show's end.

Shelton was of course selling himself short.

While the three guests were indisputable highlights Saturday they performed for only 10 minutes each. Shelton on the other hand was on stage for the show's remaining two hours and 30 minutes striving to fulfill an early evening promise to play ""the longest country concert."" (Eric Church routinely does three-hour sets but this was an impressive marathon nonetheless.)

With the charm and charisma that's made him such a winning personality on NBC's ""The Voice"" for 21 seasons Shelton handily slipped into various personas Saturday night for the raucous ""Boys 'Round Here"" the moon-eyed duet ""Nobody But You"" (which he sang facing footage of his new wife Gwen Stefani singing back to him) or the outlaw-flavored ""God's Country"" and the George Jones classic ""Ol' Red.""

There were plenty of fun interactions with the crowd too. Locking eyes with a guy in the front row for the love ballad ""Sure Be Cool If You Did"" Shelton chuckled mid-song telling him ""Sing to her not to me"" gesturing to the man's date. And for ""Hillbilly Bone"" Shelton let himself get upstaged yet again this time for a fiery duel between guitarist Beau Tackett and fiddle player Jenee Fleenor the first woman to win the CMA Award for musician of the year.

Shelton was happy to share the spotlight but after the performance he feigned a bruised ego and for the night's greatest moment invited Anderson Byrd and McBride to join him for a songwriter's circle session to see which of them had the greatest country song. (He also suggested George Strait Garth Brooks Luke Bryan and Luke Combs were going to be the judges … although they were going to stay backstage.)

""How many of y'all think if this was the 'Who talks the most (expletive) of the Friends & Heroes' tour competition we'd already have our winner?"" Byrd said gesturing to Shelton another case of the headliner being upstaged Saturday for funniest line of the night.

Shelton did his rendition of ""Who Are You When I'm Not Looking"" solo on acoustic guitar suggesting the lines ""When you undress do you leave a path/Then sink to your nose in a bubble bath"" were about Anderson.

After the performance Shelton did a little moonwalk victory dance then playfully suggested they end the competition. But Byrd wouldn't have it sparking a big singalong for a beaming ""The Keeper of the Stars"" followed by Anderson performing ""Straight Tequila Night"" (both with support from Shelton's band members). But it was clear from fans and musicians alike that McBride won this little competition with ""Independence Day.""

As they all left the stage Shelton put an end to the jealousy act saying some kind words about how much those three musicians inspired Shelton as he made his own ascent in the country music world.

""Those are Hall of Famers … you're never going to see something like that ever again"" Shelton said. ""My heroes man your heroes man. Those are country music icons all of them.""

And Saturday's show suggested there was one headline Shelton will wake up to one day: ""Blake Shelton inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.""

The takeaways

Saturday marked the second proposal at as many concerts in as many months at Fiserv Forum following a proposal during Michael Bublé’s show in September. On Saturday Shelton caught a guy in the front row getting down on his knee between songs. She said yes Shelton called for a spotlight to shine on the newly engaged couple and they hugged tightly through much of the next number “A Guy With a Girl.” “That was the coolest intro for a song I’ve ever had” Shelton told them. “You want a job? That was perfect timing.”

Shelton tossed out guitar picks throughout the night to fans in the pit for souvenirs but with security’s help he was able to give a pick out personally to an elderly fan and a young girl during closing number “God Gave Me You.”

Shelton had a squad of camera operators out to capture his performance of “Came Back as a Country Boy” his latest single being released to country radio Monday. Shelton said the footage will be used for a music video.

On each stop on his “Friends & Heroes” tour Shelton has been saluting a local hero. In Milwaukee Saturday it was Caitlin Cullen owner of the Tandem who gave away 115000 free meals to people in need during the pandemic. Cullen received a prize package from the tour and front-row seats.

With the Milwaukee date bumped a year because of the pandemic Lauren Alaina dropped off the tour and Canadian country artist Lindsay Ell took her place. More than a fair trade if you ask me mostly because the very talented Alaina’s already well known — popular enough to compete on “Dancing With the Stars” and star in a Hallmark movie last month. Ell on the other hand undoubtedly won over some new fans Saturday with smart tunes like the confident kiss-off “Want Me Back” which was seasoned like all the songs in Ell’s half-hour set by her sweet and sizzling blues guitar chops.

The battle started in July when GM sued Ford for copyright infringement saying Ford's name for its hands-free driving system BlueCruise too closely resembled GM's self-driving car subsidiary Cruise and GM's Super Cruise its hands-free driving system that it introduced in 2012 and launched in 2017.

On Sunday night GM told the Free Press the lawsuit had been resolved amicably but declined to release any final terms. A Ford spokesman said the settlement is still in process but made a comment that indicated future use of the word BlueCruise may continue on future Ford cars.

The comments come after lawyers for the automakers filed a notice of settlement with U.S. District Court Northern District California on Friday saying the parties are working out terms of a settlement. The notice requested a conditional dismissal and the two sides have 60 days to report back to the court if they’re unable to come to an agreement.

On Sunday evening GM spokesman Darryll Harrison told the Free Press ""The parties have resolved the case and related proceedings amicably and will have no further comment.”

Ford spokesman Mike Levine could not confirm that any settlement terms have been finalized and said ""We’re planning to settle the lawsuit with GM and have no further comment at this time.""

When asked to clarify GM's statement in light of the fact that the terms have not been fully finalized Harrison said ""Our on-the-record stands.""

But a clue that Ford will be keeping the use of the name BlueCruise as part of the settlement comes in Levine's comments to the Free Press that Ford will share more news at a later date about BlueCruise technology coming to additional Ford vehicles.

""In addition we recently announced that BlueCruise will be available for the new 2022 Ford Expedition and it is already available for Mustang Mach-E and F-150"" Levine said.

Ford announced BlueCruise in April soon a legal battle ignited in July when GM filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against Ford over the name.

In the complaint GM said it had been in “protracted discussions” with Ford over the name but were unable to come to agreement. GM's Cruise self-driving subsidiary has been in business since 2013.

In August Ford filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that the term “cruise” was “ubiquitous"" for driver-assist features a term that's been in use for 50 years and that consumers associate with many carmakers. Levine has called GM’s trademark claims “meritless and frivolous” and Ford petitioned the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office asking GM’s trademarks of “Cruise” and “SuperCruise” be rescinded.

On Sept. 10 U.S. District Judge Susan Illston cast doubt over GM's move to block Ford's use of the term BlueCruise during a hearing for GM's preliminary injunction blocking Ford from using BlueCruise.

""I feel like the likelihood of success on the merits is unclear to me at this point. It seems to me there are validity issues about the idea of using the Cruise designation and the mark Super Cruise since it was -- I think there is substantial evidence it was used before in a -- in a more generic framework and it seems to me that Super Cruise for example is far more generic or descriptive than anything else and ditto with Cruise"" Illston said according to a transcript from the hearing.

The judge said evidence of confusion over the word ""cruise"" is lacking.

""I'm unclear about likelihood of success on the merits and that's the primary thing that would incline me to deny the motion"" Illston said.

She also noted ""I personally take a jazz cruise every now and then and occasionally there is a blues cruise"" she said. ""I'm just saying the words you chose to use as your own are used by other people all the time.""

The Blue Oval reported 150000 reservations on September 16th and the base variant starts from $39974 before incentives. Those figures are both great and bad news for the Ford Motor Company which has to make as many trucks as technically possible in the first year of production. This implies loads of batteries a plethora of microchips and retailers that don’t mark up the suggested price like they currently do with the 2021 Bronco.According to LightningOwners.com forum member EFX4 a salesperson has recently confirmed that the order bank is scheduled to open on October 26th. That’s when dealers will be able to convert reservations to orders but it’s also worth mentioning that we’re dealing with mere speculation here. Another forum member by the name of Spade312 confronts EFX4 with the FMC Dealer portal which doesn’t mention any ordering information at all.Still the Ford Motor Company will confirm the date in due time because the first units are due to arrive in dealer forecourts in the spring. Currently in the pre-production stage the F-150 Lightning is expected to number 80000 units in the first year compared to 40000 as previously anticipated.Including 1000 pounds (454 kilograms) of whatnots the zero-emission pickup targets 230 miles (370 kilometers) for the standard battery and 300 miles (483 kilometers) for the large battery. On a fast charger the long-range variant is capable of juicing up with 54 miles (87 kilometers) every 10 minutes. As long as you can find a 150-charging station it should take you around 41 minutes from 15- to 80-percent state of charge.The XLT which is better equipped than the commercial-oriented Pro mentioned earlier kicks off at $52974.

October 2 2021 — Ford Fusion transmission problems have caused a class action lawsuit that alleges 2010-2017 Fusions suffer all sorts of problems due to the automatic transmissions.

The 841-page Ford Fusion class action lawsuit names multiple allegedly defects components:

Failing fluid seal integrity

Throttle body deficiencies

Failed torque converter welds

Driveshaft failure

Failed transmission control module updates

Failed powertrain control module

The lawsuit alleges most of the problems come from Fusion 6F35 transmissions found in all automatic non-hybrid Fusions from 2013 and later and many 2010-2012 Ford Fusions.

Some 2010-2012 Ford Fusion cars may also be equipped with 6-speed automatic transmissions known as Aisin or Aisin Warner transmissions. But the class action says none of the cars appear to involve these transmissions.

All Ford Fusions equipped with manual transmissions are excluded from this class action lawsuit.

The Ford Fusion transmission problems allegedly cause multiple symptoms.

Sudden and unexpected shaking

Violent jerking bucking and kicking on acceleration

Delayed acceleration

Gears slipping

Difficulty stopping the vehicle

Lack or loss of motive power

Delayed downshifts

Hard decelerations or clunks when slowing down or accelerating at low speeds

According to the plaintiffs Ford knew in 2009 the Fusion transmission problems existed but failed to tell consumers about the alleged defects. Additionally the plaintiffs claim a Ford Fusion transmission recall should have been issued long ago.

Every Ford plaintiff alleges they brought their Fusions to dealerships to fix the transmission problems but Ford allegedly has no adequate repairs or procedures for the transmissions other than ""temporary stop-gap measures destined to fail in the future.""

The lawsuit alleges Ford lied to customers as to the reasons for the transmission problems as owners allegedly suffer from Fusions that fail while driving on the highways.

The Ford Fusion transmission class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan: Gant et al. v. Ford Motor Company.

The plaintiffs are represented by Stern Law PLLC and Marino Law PLLC."

Golfweek

If you were watching the Sanderson Farms Championship on Saturday you probably shot 67 from your couch.

A whopping 22 players shot 5-under or better during the third round at Country Club of Jackson including 54-hole leader and PGA Tour rookie Sahith Theegala. The Pepperdine product after a ""pretty wild"" round holds a one-shot lead at 18 under over Cameron Tringale Denny McCarthy Sam Burns and Cameron Young.

Theegala the men's college player of the year in 2020 is off to a strong start in the professional ranks following his made cut at the Fortinet Championship two weeks ago the first event of the new Tour season.

""I started off playing really well really solid just missed a few makeable putts but felt like my game was good"" Theegala said of his bogey-free round. ""Then I started to hit some — I got a few to go in at the start of the back nine — and then I hit some wild drives I mean way right so was really happy to escape with a couple pars. It just felt like a grind those last five six holes there. Obviously really happy with how I ground that out.""

Theegala made five birdies and 13 pars in his round and was as close to an eagle as you can get on the 303-yard par-4 15th. When his drive ran off the back of the green leaving an 84-foot pitch to the hole Theegala ran one right at the cup and suffered one of the more brutal lipouts you'll see.

""I can't wait to see the replay of that to see what happened because it literally looked like more than a 360"" Theegala said of the shot. ""I didn't have the greatest vantage point but it was literally going right at the stick and I'm like 'OK that's in with good speed.' But yeah I can't believe that lipout. That was like people saw that lipout of Spieth at the Ryder Cup that might have been worse.""

Still searching for his first win on Tour in his 311th start Tringale shot the low round of the day a bogey-free 10-under 62 to match his career best. Tringale went birdie-eagle-birdie-eagle on the par 5s Saturday.

""I was just in control in complete command of the ball and those are fun days definitely didn't feel that way starting out the week but I feel like I've gained a little confidence each day"" Tringale said of his week in Mississippi. ""I would say this was a combination of hitting a lot of good shots and having good breaks just on the same day.

""I love playing obviously I've been out here a long time I haven't won but I love competing and I just want to see if I can keep beating guys … I'm kind of a journeyman to this point and I'm enjoying the journey.""

McCarthy and Burns each shot 7-under 65 and Young signed for a 5-under 67. Seth Reeves sits T-6 alongside Trey Mullinax at 16-under after a career low 9-under 63. Aaron Wise (67) and Roger Sloan (68) are T-8 at 15 under.

While 15 players are within four shots of the lead entering Sunday's final round according to the Tour the Sanderson Farms Championship is the only event where each of the last four 54-hole leaders or co-leaders have converted for the win: Ryan Armour (2017) Cameron Champ (2018) Sebastián Muñoz (2019) and Sergio Garcia (2020).

""Definitely a little nerves in there for sure but I think people have said before pressure's a privilege and I'm trying to use those nerves to my advantage"" Theegala said of the pressure and nerves on the course. ""I'm just having a good time with (caddie Carl Smith) out there and regardless of the golf that's what it boils down to golf's a game and try and enjoy it as much as I can.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsbGJsYWNrcy5jb20vbmV3cy9zcHJpbmdib2tzLWVkZ2UtYWxsLWJsYWNrcy1pbi1uYWlsLWJpdGluZy1jbGFzaNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Springboks edge All Blacks in nail-biting clash,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.allblacks.com', port=443): Read timed out.

He also dedicated himself to philanthropy and focused much of his giving on his hometown including major donations to the University of Nebraska Omaha and the Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium.

In Nebraska ""our problem is we can’t move any mountains here or any oceans here"" Mr. Scott told the New York Times in 1998. ""We’re stuck on the prairie. So we’re going to have to make the most of what we have.""

Mr. Scott who died Sept. 25 at the age of 90 served as chief executive of what is now Kiewit Corp. a builder of highways tunnels and other projects from 1979 to 1998. He diversified the company with investments in telecommunications and energy.

Mr. Scott later was chairman of Level 3 Communications Inc. a Kiewit spinoff that built a fiber-optic network to carry internet traffic. Level 3 was a hot stock in the late 1990s but then floundered amid a glut of long-distance fiber transmission capacity.

He was a longtime director of Mr. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and allied himself with the famed Omaha investor to move more deeply into energy utilities. Berkshire Hathaway and Mr. Scott helped lead a 1999 acquisition of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co.—a supplier of electric power and natural gas based in Des Moines Iowa—for about $2 billion. That business later was expanded and renamed Berkshire Hathaway Energy.

Largely because of his stake in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Mr. Scott had a net worth of $4.2 billion Forbes estimated.

Walter Scott Jr. the grandson of an immigrant carpenter from Dundee Scotland was born May 21 1931 and grew up in Omaha. His father was chief engineer at Peter Kiewit Sons’ Inc. a construction company founded in 1884.

At age 14 Mr. Scott earned the rank of Eagle Scout. He made money for college with summer jobs on an Oregon ranch and later at Kiewit construction sites. At Colorado State University he initially planned to study range management but switched to civil engineering after a friend told him it would mean better career opportunities.

He married a high school sweetheart Carolyn Falk in 1952 and graduated from Colorado State in 1953.

He served briefly in the Air Force then rejoined Kiewit.

While raising his children Mr. Scott moved his family to 17 job sites in a dozen years. He was named chairman and chief executive in 1979 succeeding Peter Kiewit the son of a company founder.

In 2010 Mr. Scott was among 40 families and individuals who signed the Giving Pledge  a campaign organized by Bill and Melinda French Gates and Mr. Buffett to encourage wealthy people to donate the bulk of their fortunes.

Mr. Scott had four children with his first wife Carolyn Falk Scott who died of cancer in 1983. In 1987 he married Suzanne Marshall a former elementary school teacher who had been executive director of the Omaha Zoo Foundation. She died in 2013.

Among the Scotts’ many donations to the zoo was funding for a penguin exhibit.

A profile of Mr. Scott published by the Horatio Alger Association quoted him as having given this advice to his children: ""The greatest thing you can do in life is to be a giver because the world already has plenty of takers.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEwcGhvZW5peC5jb20vbmV3cy9mZWRzLXNlaXplLXRob3VzYW5kcy1vZi1zcGljZXMtYWRkaXRpdmVzLWZyb20taW5zYW5pdGFyeS1mbG9yaWRhLXdhcmVob3VzZdIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEwcGhvZW5peC5jb20vbmV3cy9mZWRzLXNlaXplLXRob3VzYW5kcy1vZi1zcGljZXMtYWRkaXRpdmVzLWZyb20taW5zYW5pdGFyeS1mbG9yaWRhLXdhcmVob3VzZS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Feds seize thousands of spices additives from ‘insanitary’ Florida warehouse,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on behalf of the U.S. Marshals Service seized spices and food additives that were held in ""insanitary"" conditions at Lyden Spice Corporation in Miami Florida Friday.

As companies work to mitigate costs and keep up with demand ahead of the holiday season some experts are warning consumers to buy ""hard-to-get"" items sooner rather than later.

""These delays are significant"" Freightwaves founder and CEO Craig Fuller told FOX Business’ Maria Bartiromo on Friday. ""I would recommend everyone to go ahead and buy those hard-to-get items now versus waiting until the holidays.""

Fuller expects toys clothing and electronics will be the hardest items to come by this year and that the supply chain may not normalize until 2023.

In the past year inflation rose 4.3% up slightly from the previous month and the highest in more than three decades. However Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell expressed hope on Thursday that the supply chain problems could start improving next year potentially pushing inflation lower within the first half of 2022.

Despite the supply chain bottlenecks consumer spending rose 0.8% in August up from 0.1% in July and higher than the 0.6% increase expected by economists surveyed by Refinitiv.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3QucGgvbmV3c2ZlYXR1cmVzL2N1bHR1cmUvMTAyNjM0L3NreWNhYmxlLWhhbHRzLWRpc25leS1mb3gtdW5hdmFpbGFibGUtYTQzNzMtMjAyMTEwMDLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Disney FOX Channels No Longer on SKYCable,"Cable television provider SKYCable Corp. said subscribers would no longer be able to watch Disney and FOX channels effective Oct. 1.

He also dedicated himself to philanthropy and focused much of his giving on his hometown including major donations to the University of Nebraska Omaha and the Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium.

In Nebraska ""our problem is we can’t move any mountains here or any oceans here"" Mr. Scott told the New York Times in 1998. ""We’re stuck on the prairie. So we’re going to have to make the most of what we have.""

Mr. Scott who died Sept. 25 at the age of 90 served as chief executive of what is now Kiewit Corp. a builder of highways tunnels and other projects from 1979 to 1998. He diversified the company with investments in telecommunications and energy.

Mr. Scott later was chairman of Level 3 Communications Inc. a Kiewit spinoff that built a fiber-optic network to carry internet traffic. Level 3 was a hot stock in the late 1990s but then floundered amid a glut of long-distance fiber transmission capacity.

He was a longtime director of Mr. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and allied himself with the famed Omaha investor to move more deeply into energy utilities. Berkshire Hathaway and Mr. Scott helped lead a 1999 acquisition of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co.—a supplier of electric power and natural gas based in Des Moines Iowa—for about $2 billion. That business later was expanded and renamed Berkshire Hathaway Energy.

Largely because of his stake in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Mr. Scott had a net worth of $4.2 billion Forbes estimated.

Walter Scott Jr. the grandson of an immigrant carpenter from Dundee Scotland was born May 21 1931 and grew up in Omaha. His father was chief engineer at Peter Kiewit Sons’ Inc. a construction company founded in 1884.

At age 14 Mr. Scott earned the rank of Eagle Scout. He made money for college with summer jobs on an Oregon ranch and later at Kiewit construction sites. At Colorado State University he initially planned to study range management but switched to civil engineering after a friend told him it would mean better career opportunities.

He married a high school sweetheart Carolyn Falk in 1952 and graduated from Colorado State in 1953.

He served briefly in the Air Force then rejoined Kiewit.

While raising his children Mr. Scott moved his family to 17 job sites in a dozen years. He was named chairman and chief executive in 1979 succeeding Peter Kiewit the son of a company founder.

In 2010 Mr. Scott was among 40 families and individuals who signed the Giving Pledge  a campaign organized by Bill and Melinda French Gates and Mr. Buffett to encourage wealthy people to donate the bulk of their fortunes.

Mr. Scott had four children with his first wife Carolyn Falk Scott who died of cancer in 1983. In 1987 he married Suzanne Marshall a former elementary school teacher who had been executive director of the Omaha Zoo Foundation. She died in 2013.

Among the Scotts’ many donations to the zoo was funding for a penguin exhibit.

A profile of Mr. Scott published by the Horatio Alger Association quoted him as having given this advice to his children: ""The greatest thing you can do in life is to be a giver because the world already has plenty of takers.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9lY29ub215L3NoaXBwaW5nLWNvbnRhaW5lci1jb3N0cy1yZWNvcmQtaGlnaC1jaGluYS11c9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9lY29ub215L3NoaXBwaW5nLWNvbnRhaW5lci1jb3N0cy1yZWNvcmQtaGlnaC1jaGluYS11cy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cost of shipping container from China to US hits record high in September,"The cost to transport shipping containers between China and the United States surged to a record high in September.

Chief financial officer Richard Galanti estimated on the company's fourth quarters earnings call that overall price inflation for its products is now in the range of 3.5% to 4.5% up from the previous quarter's estimate of 2.5% to 3.5% and that both Costco and its suppliers are paying two to six times more for containers and shipping.

In addition to placing its orders earlier Galanti said Costco would charter three of its own container ships to transport goods between Asia and North America. Each ship will carry about 800 to 1000 containers at one time and the company plans to make approximately 10 deliveries over the course of 2022.

Yet when it comes to choosing what I want on my wrist at the London Marathon it wasn’t a hard decision to make. I’m opting for my tried and trusted Garmin Fenix 6S Sapphire here’s why.

The best Garmin watches to buy in 2021

Inspired by the marathon? Here are the best running shoes to invest in

The Garmin Fenix 6S Sapphire is a premium multisport watch designed for adventures on rugged terrains with mapping and intelligent pacing to help you pace better on hills. While the London Marathon definitely won’t be a multisport adventure and I’m unlikely to need the maps features the Fenix 6S Sapphire has a number of other brilliant features that make it an obvious choice for my fourth marathon.

1. It’s easy to use

The Fenix 6S is a chunky piece of equipment. With a case size of 42mm it’s noticeably bigger than say my Apple Watch Series 6 but it’s still not quite as big as the Fenix 6X solar which comes in at 51mm. That said my main challenge when running with smaller devices — say the Fitbit Charge 5 — is trying to see the screen while maintaining my pace. The Fenix 6S has a bright 1.2-inch screen that’s easy to read in rain or shine and like with all Garmin running watches you can customize the metrics you want to see on each screen.

On marathon day I’ll be keeping an eye on my 5K splits as I attempt to run sub-four hours again but I don’t want too much data in front of me as I focus on my run. I opt to see my lap distance lap time lap pace and heart rate but all of these settings can be customized in the settings.

One of my top tips when it comes to running with a watch at any race is to turn the auto-lap off and manually lap the watch every time you cross a mile marker. Doing this you can see your exact pace for the previous mile as you’ll often run further than the course distance on race day.

2. It’s got a great battery life

Although I’m hoping to beat my personal record of 3 hours and 58 minutes the Fenix 6S has a battery life of six hours in GPS mode with music playing or 50 hours in GPS mode without music. Either way I should hopefully have crossed the line and have my feet up before I need to worry about charging my watch.

3. It’s got the option to add music to the watch

The Garmin Fenix 6S has the option to store up to 2000 songs on the watch or access playlists from various music streaming apps including Spotify Amazon Music and Deezer. During training runs I’ll often leave my phone at home and use my watch to track my run and play music or podcasts. That said things are a little different this race day as the London Marathon requires runners to drop their kit bag off at the race expo in the few days before the race. As I wouldn’t want to be without my phone for days on end I’ll be running with it on race day so will play my music from my iPhone and save my watch’s battery but the music onboarding is a handy feature I’ve used on race day before.

4. The recovery data will help post-race

After each workout my Garmin Fenix 6S tells me how long I need off from training to let my body fully recover. This time is based on training intensity stress daily activity and sleep. Although I definitely don’t have any hard workouts planned for the week following the race I find the recovery tool to be really beneficial during my training. The recovery time is reduced when you get a good night’s sleep so I’ll also be tracking this in the days following the race.

5. The watch straps are easily swappable

The Fenix 6S came with a beautiful heathered nylon band which looked great on the watch but wasn’t all that practical when it came to marathon training. Without sounding gross the strap wasn’t the easiest to clean after sweaty summer miles. Thankfully the bands are super easy to swap and I’ll be using a silicone band for the race this weekend. This might not sound like a selling point for a running watch but you don’t want to be worried about your strap pinching or rubbing at mile 20.

6. It doesn’t look like a fitness watch

One of the reasons I often opt for my Fenix 6S over say the Garmin Forerunner 245 or Forerunner 745 is because it doesn’t look like a sports watch. While I’m not too worried about what I look like on race day when I’m celebrating with friends after the race I know I’ll like the look of the rose gold bezel on my wrist.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRjcmFpbm1ha2VyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwL3dlZWstaW4tcmV2aWV3LW9jdG9iZXItM3JkLTIwMjEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Week in Review–October 3rd 2021,"The Week in Review is a collection of both all the goodness I’ve written during the past week around the internet as well as a small pile of links I found interesting – generally endurance sports related. I’ve often wondered what to do with all of the coolness that people write and while I share a lot of it on Twitter and Facebook this is a better forum for sending it on to y’all. Most times these different streams don’t overlap so be on the lookout at all these places for good stuff!

So with that let’s get into the action!

Sports Tech Deals:

Not many deals yet mostly the quiet before the storm of typical Black Friday deals a bit over a month from now. However this deal for UK/EU folks on the Tacx NEO 2 SE is solid (better deal in the UK than EU but still a deal). Also a deal for US folks too. That trainer is basically just a Tacx NEO 2 but with additional thru-axle support. While it lacks the (very small) handful of new features on the Tacx NEO 2T it’s actually the Tacx NEO 2 that I use at home as my main trainer (whereas at the DCR Cave/Office I tend to use a KICKR V5). Point being I’d happily save that much money compared to a NEO 2T given the minor benefits.

Stuff I Found Interesting Around The Interwebs:

Here’s a not-so-small smattering of all the random things that I stumbled on while doing my civic duty to find the end of the Internet. Also there’s a few things this week that were actually from a week or two ago – I’m just catching up on this list:

1) How to run Zwift & TrainerRoad At the Same Time on an iPad: Good quick tutorial on doing something far more efficiently than I usually do (which is two different devices at once). The main reason folks want to run both at once is that you get points on Zwift for time in the saddle whereas you want TrainerRoad for the structured workouts/programs.

2) Amazon Expands Halo Fitness Products: I toyed with the previous Halo device a while when it first came out but just found it kinda blah. Sorta like a bad knock-off without any clear purpose. I think my core issue was that it lacked a screen and while Whoop has the same general concept Halo lacked any real insights that Whoop manages to deliver (setting aside my accuracy issues on the earlier 3.0 unit). In any case might pick up another one when it comes out and poke again – perhaps this will do a better job at finding that middle ground.

3) Racing in the Age of COVID – Be Flexible: A good reminder that the machine isn’t as well oiled as it was a few years ago and races aren’t just navigating complex restrictions – but also simply getting race logistics aspects back up and swinging again. Speaking of which I owe folks a triathlon race report from last weekend. Maybe tomorrow.

4) One Woman Ran 916 Smartwatch ECG’s Last Year: Look I had this on a browser tab from July and it apparently never made it into a Week in Review. This was just too amazing not to share. Also I plan to hire this 70-year-old woman…stat!

5) Peloton Makes More Commercial-Focused Changes via Precor: Not only did Peloton recently add their bike to Precor’s portfolio (allowing commercial organizations to more easily pick it up through existing procurement channels) but also in last week’s terms of service pop-up that all Peloton users got they quietly added 20 person limit per device (to access). For a home user this is of course a non-issue. But for a hotel this is a non-starter. Instead hotels/offices/etc need to use a commercial account.

6) Withings Adds New ScanWatch Horizon Dive Watch: This one is peculiar to me. The watch itself looks great and setting aside the accuracy of the sleep apnea bits for a second I don’t entirely understand the dive angle. Namely due to the 100m rating. It’s not that the 100m isn’t sufficient for the *vast* majority of divers it’s that the perception is that it isn’t. There’s an (incorrect) perception among divers that you need to have a rating 3-5x the actual rating (or that you supposedly can’t press buttons). And while that might have been fun decades ago it’s simply not based on any actual science or testing. Assuming a company tests and certifies a device to a given level then yes you can actually do it to that level. I used to demonstrate this with my waterproof test chamber (including pressing buttons) until it became so boring to do because everything always passed. But my point is that fighting that perception is tough and the linked article demonstrates that easily.

Each week I quickly highlight some of the new firmware app software and website service updates that I see go out. If you’re a sports technology company and release an update – shoot me a quick note (just one-liners are perfect or Tweet it at me is even better) and I’ll make mention of it here. If I don’t know about it I won’t be able to post about it. Sound good? Oh – and if you want to get a head start on things this page is a great resource for watching Garmin Wahoo Polar and a few other firmware updates.

With that thanks for reading!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vcm9hZC5jYy9jb250ZW50L3Jldmlldy9zaGltYW5vLWR1cmEtYWNlLWZjLXI5MjAwLXAtcG93ZXItbWV0ZXItMjg2Nzgx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shimano Dura-Ace FC-R9200-P power meter,"The Shimano Dura-Ace R9200-P power meter is the redesign that many of us have been waiting for. Setup is dead simple the design is compact and there are smaller improvements such as a replaceable battery door and the fact that it uses the same magnetic charging cable as Di2. There were some accuracy issues with the power readings during testing but everything appeared to be mostly consistent and the L/R balance is spot on.

Shimano's latest updates of its Dura-Ace and Ultegra groupsets included the launch of new power meters. The Dura-Ace R9200-P is a crank-based power meter that has seen the cranks designed around the power meter rather than the power meter gubbins being retrofitted to the cranks as was the case with the Dura-Ace R9100-P units. Shimano has done this in an attempt to achieve better accuracy and reliability with the data that the dual-sided design spits out.

Our testing put the R9200-P up against Garmin's Rally pedals. We've compared the power data cadence figures and the left/right balance scores of both.

Comparative testing

Let's tackle accuracy first as that is the most important factor. I'll begin by saying that the Garmin Rally pedals I'm using for comparison performed well when Anna reviewed a separate set shortly after their launch. The set I have here were consistently reading lower than the R9200-P during my testing and the difference was significant. They were down by about the same margin when I compared to my two 4iiii power meters.

If we take a closer look at one of the intervals the average power of the R9200-P is 335W while the Rally pedals measure 307W – 28W (or 8.4%) lower. There's something fishy going on there.

Rolling home from the same session I decided to give it a nudge in a sprint. The Rally pedals are ever so slightly faster to pick up the effort but the R9200-P registered a higher peak power of 942W (I'm not a sprinter). The Rally's 910W peak power is 32W (3.4%) lower.

I handed the R9200-P over to road.cc boss Dave Atkinson for a bit of extra testing. He set it up on his trusty Tacx Neo 2 that has been used to test a number of power meters. Here the Shimano R9200-P read marginally under the Tacx giving an average power of 241W for the session compared with 245W from the Tacx (granted comparing averages across a whole session is of limited value).

The graph shows that the R9200-P tracks the Tacx relatively well at figures between 200-300W and is bang on at around the 150W mark. There is some separation in the figures at higher wattages and this is more noticeable when standing (third interval and sprints at the end). The separation seems to be more apparent the higher that you go suggesting that the R9200-P is a percentage point or two different to the Tacx Neo 2.

We've never had any accurate crank or pedal-based power meter come in under the Tacx Neo's figures; it's usually the lowest. You put power into the bike through the pedals with the cranks the next link in the chain so you'd expect the Shimano R9200-P to read higher than a Tacx Neo because of drivetrain losses (there will always be greater losses the further along the chain you go). This leads us to think that the Shimano R9200-P is under-reporting but as long as it's consistent under-reporting that's not necessarily a huge deal.

Left/right balance

The asymmetry of the R9100-P drive-side crank design meant that Shimano and pretty much every third-party power meter maker that used the R9100 crankset had at some point a serious headache ensuring that the left/right power balance was accurate. The R9200-P drive-side crank features what looks like a symmetrical design and the power balance looks to have been sorted.

On every dual-sided power meter I've used I've been 50.5/49.5% or something around that. For this particular interval session I was 50.6/49.4% so nothing unusual there. Dave's test data (above) supported this showing his usual pedalling imbalance of 52/48%.

Cadence

Often if you're seeing issues in a set of power figures you're going to see issues with the cadence data. Shimano still uses a magnet mounted to the frame to deliver cadence data and it seems to be working nicely.

The R9200-P power meter was quick to pick up changes in my cadence be that at the start of a sprint pedalling out of a corner or as I nearly collapsed following an ill-advised fourth hill repeat.

Dave's data supports this showing that the R9200-P is absolutely spot on. The R9200-P does well at all points from the general riding cadence between 85-90rpm to the slogging up a climb speed of around 55rpm and finally Dave's higher-end leg speed of over 100rpm.

Consistency

I said at the start of the review that consistency in the data that a power meter provides is the important thing for me. Power data is just a set of numbers to work to and as long as the figures are consistent day to day week to week you'll be able to use the data to measure improvement.

> 12 reasons why you should buy and use a power meter

The Shimano R9200-P data has been consistent for me. Okay it seems to read quite a lot higher than the Garmin Rally pedals and a little lower than the Tacx Neo 2 but quite consistently so and we can't say for certain which is closest to the true power output. There have been no data dropouts no weird spikes or troughs on the graphs and the result is that I'd be happy to train using the data.

The key thing is that if you bought the R9200-P and did your initial testing to set your training zones you could then train with confidence in the data that is appearing on your head unit.

Setting up

Away from the data that the R9200-P delivers there is setting up and ease of use to consider. I'm going to assume you've gone ahead and bought a bike with this power meter already installed. With current supply issues that's pretty much the only way you're going to get one at the moment so I won't cover the installation procedure that is identical to the last version's and therefore pretty straightforward.

The good thing about this is that while you can hook the power meter up to your phone via the eTube app you don't have to. Turn on your bike computer – I've got Garmin's Edge 1030 Plus – head to the bit where you search for sensors and after a quick half-turn of the cranks the unit will show up.

Calibration should according to the app be done with the drive-side crank in the six o'clock position and if everything is rosy you'll get a reading of '5050'. You can also do the zero offset via the small button on the unit itself. It is incredibly simple.

And that's it. You should calibrate your power meter before every ride but that is standard practice.

Charging

Charging is simple and is done using the same cable that comes with the latest 12-speed Di2 groupsets. That might sound like a small feature but it is good to have the simplicity of a single cable. Shimano says the power meter will run for over 300 hours and you won't be surprised to learn that I haven't got close to needing to recharge.

Another smaller change is that the cover for the charging port is now replaceable which is good because it still doesn't feel like the most robust design. Everything inside is claimed to be waterproof though so you shouldn't need to worry.

ANT+ and Bluetooth

Shimano has continued with the ability to broadcast power data via ANT+ or BLE whereas it added BLE power broadcasting to the R9100-P after about a year of the power meter being available.

The daily ride has seen the R9200-P work quietly with no connectivity or data issues; it's a very easy power meter to live with.

Value

First up I'd like to open a can of worms by debating the need for dual-sided data for the vast majority of riders. Okay independent L/R data can help to identify an issue before it becomes an injury but if you normally ride pain-free chances are that a left-only power meter will give you the data you require at a fraction of the price.

The R9200-P raises the price of the standard R9200 chainset from £549 to £1199. That's a decent jump so it might be worth exploring a left-side only add-on from Stages or 4iiii if you haven't got the cash for the R9200-P.

Currently the third-party brands that install their own power-measuring tech into Shimano's cranksets are yet to release their prices or availability. It'll also be quite a while before we know either so comparing value is a little tricky right now.

The good news is that the R9200-P has retained the £1199 price tag of the R9100-P so there's no nasty price hike with the 12-speed model.

Conclusion

Shimano's Dura-Ace R9200-P power meter appeared to deliver consistent data but was overreading quite a lot compared to a comparison power meter. The cadence and L/R balance data is perfectly usable for daily training. The unit is very easy to live with thanks to the quick connection to head units and an improved Shimano eTube app makes updates a doddle. The price has stayed the same as the previous generation.

Verdict

A good power meter with some accuracy issues but easy to train with and Shimano has sorted the L/R balance issues",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdG93YXJkc2RhdGFzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9hbmFseXplLXlvdXItaGVhbHRoLWFuZC1maXRuZXNzLWRhdGEtdXNpbmctanVsaWEtZDZmNGMzODQyYjE30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Analyze Your Health and Fitness Data using Julia,"Analyze Your Health and Fitness Data using Julia

I wear a watch almost everyday. My habitual partner has been a Samsung Gear S3 Frontier which I bought way back in 2018 for my birthday. Apart from the usual features expected from a watch it has a bunch of sensors to record various activities such as steps distance climbed floors and heart rate (via a photoplethysmogram). The newer Galaxy line of watches also feature sensors for recording blood oxygen and EKG. As a tech nerd this naturally makes me excited!

The data recorded by these sensors is passed on to the Samsung Health App which already does a good job of summarizing them into nice visuals. However the programmer in me has always been itching to do more with it. Fortunately Samsung allows us to download the raw data (.csv files) directly from the app. If you are a Samsung watch/phone user you can download your health data by following the instructions as described in this article. I guess there are ways to do this for Fitbit and Garmin users as well. If you find something useful do let me know in the comments.

In this guide we will make use of various packages from the Julia ecosystem. I did this exercise using Pluto.jl which allows us to create interactive code notebooks (available here). You can also choose your own editor such as VS Code.

Setting up Pluto

In case you are new to Julia you will first need to install the binaries suitable for your system from here. One installed open the Julia REPL. Press ‘]’ to enter the Pkg (Julia’s built-in package manager) prompt. Then type add Pluto . This will download the Pluto package and also compile it for you. Press backspace to come back to the Julia prompt. Then type using Pluto followed by Pluto.run() . A new browser window showing the Pluto homepage should open. You can go ahead and create a new notebook.

If you are familiar with Jupyter you already know how to use Pluto. However keep in mind the following peculiarities:

Pluto is a reactive notebook which means that cells are linked to each other. When you update a cell all other cells dependent on it also get updated. That also means you cannot use the same variable names at two places unless their scope is local (e.g. in functions).

When writing multiple lines in a code cell you need to wrap then in a begin-end block. You will be given an option to do this automatically when executing (shift + enter) such a block.

To import all the relevant packages in your working environment execute the following:

using PlutoUI DataFrames CSV Query VegaLite Dates HTTP Statistics

Obtaining input data

We will read the data directly from my GitHub repository using CSV.jl and store them in the form of DataFrames. For visualization we will make use of the excellent VegaLite.jl package. Data from the Samsung Health app is available in the form of various csv files however we will only be using the following three:

com.samsung.shealth.tracker.pedometer_day_summary.<timestamp>.csv

com.samsung.shealth.tracker.heart_rate.<timestamp>.csv

com.samsung.health.floors_climbed.<timestamp>.csv

Filenames are rather self-explanatory. We can read the data directly into a DataFrame as shown below. We set header = 2 so that the second row is used to name the columns.

Read the CSV files into the respective DataFrames

Cleaning and some organization

Let’s explore what our DataFrame actually contains.

You can also try the following:

The create_time column represents the time when the data entry was recorded and is of type “String”. We need to convert it to a “DateTime” object which will later allow for sorting and easier plotting. Additionally we can also convert the distance column into km (from m) and active_time into minutes. Finally we clean the DataFrame by removing duplicate entries and sort w.r.t. time.

Actions for cleaning and sorting

We calculate the cumulative distance and add it to a separate column cumul_distance. For later use it is also handy to classify days as 'weekday' or 'weekend' and add them to a separate day_type column. Similarly for the new day and month columns.

Adding new columns

Filtering based on time

Using the PlutoUI.jl package we can further enhance the interactive experience by adding buttons sliders etc. For instance to bind a DateTime value to our variable start_date do the following.

Insert an interactive date selector

DataFrame is filtered based on the time range selected above. @filter is a powerful macro provided by the Query.jl package. We filter out rows for which create_time lies between start_date and end_date as shown below:

Filtering using Query.jl

Mr Bloom is part of a growing brigade of digital nomads in Europe who work remotely while satisfying their wanderlust. This kind of itinerant lifestyle is as old as laptops and free internet. But covid-19 has given it a boost. A game of lockdown arbitrage began earlier this year as border controls eased and people fled congested cities like Berlin and London. Some headed for other cities such as Lisbon and Madrid which offered sunshine and looser lockdown rules. Others chose remote spots on the Mediterranean and in the Alps. Now covid-19 restrictions are easing but the trend continues as many Europeans reject a traditional office routine after a year and a half of remote work.

This event titled 'Cyber security & Cloud Services' was dedicated to CXO and technical functions dealing with Cloud and security topics.

Opening the event was Chiara Caroti Google Cloud's Head of Corporate and Digital Native for Italy and Malta and Nicolò Moschi Malta Territory Lead at Google Cloud.

Caroti began by stating that since 2006 when Cloud computing was first introduced the market has grown exponentially and is expected to reach $1251.09 billion by 2028. Part of its success has been its adaptability; Google Cloud quickly adapts to moments of change such as changes brought about by the pandemic. Through these changes economic recovery has been recognized as being a catalyst for transformation.

For the fourth consecutive year Gartner has positioned Google as a Leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure and Platform Services. Google Cloud's success can be attributed to the unique features it offers its clients. Moschi delves into what makes it different.

Firstly Google Cloud delivers end-to-end security solutions from the data center all the way to the device with a purpose-built infrastructure and security by default.

Moschi continues that the company believes in an open Cloud which has been designed to support whatever system best suits one's needs whether hybrid multi-cloud or something in between.

Talking about user experience it was important to make Cloud easy to use Moschi says by automating manual tasks and configuration wherever possible so clients' teams can focus on development and less on managing infrastructure.

Nicolò Moschi Malta Territory Lead at Google Cloud.

Moschi also remarks that intelligence is embedded into everything making it easy for the clients to apply artificial intelligence and machine learning in their own organization. He concludes that Google Cloud brings clients the best of Google in its solutions and can help one create a more innovative and collaborative culture in one's organization.

A Forrester Wave report showed that Google scored the highest for its strategy among cloud providers for native security. Google brings clients end-to-end security with custom-built layers - from infrastructure to endpoints - derived from the company's own experience of protecting the billions of customers that use its services.

Google's privately-managed network infrastructure is the largest in the industry. It ensures that one's information and applications are the least exposed to the public internet and its inherent risks. On top of that Moschi elaborates Google offers VPC Service Controls that allow one to further define one's own security perimeters around one's GCP resources.

Moreover Google Cloud is the only system which offers Cloud Data Loss Prevention as an API that can be used in applications which scans and redacts sensitive data before it is sent to the cloud. Through the Cloud DLP UI  users can easily automate data protection schedules with features such as inspection templates inspection jobs and job triggers. Additionally Google is once again the only system which offers encryption at rest by default.

In the hybrid and multi-cloud world Google can help clients succeed through Anthos. Anthos is a different kind of hybrid cloud software that overcomes some of the trade-offs which keep IT from giving the business what it wants. This means that one doesn't have to compromise between agility and reliability or between choice and consistency. With Anthos one can manage applications across on-premise and cloud providers - without lock-in - and build applications once that can run anywhere.

Another benefit of Google Cloud is its machine learning software. Clients can gain access to the deep learning systems that power Google and integrate it seamlessly with their datasources in the cloud or on prem. Machine learning according to Google CEO Sundar Pichai is ""a core transformative way"" by which Google is rethinking how they're doing everything.

Moschi then introduces Google Cloud's strategy for Malta's ecosystem - a partnership with the joint venture between AmagisTech and Nohup. AmagisTech a Google Cloud Reference Partner in Malta have a deep understanding of the Maltese ecosystem having been active since 2013 and will thus be able to provide local players with the support they need. Nohup is a Google Cloud Premier Partner based in Italy that will fully support AmagisTech and Google Cloud in the digitalisation journey of Maltese companies. The importance of digital transformation in Malta has recently been highlighted by Nationalist party leader Bernard Grech who during the Independence Day rally said that Malta should aim to become a global technology hub.

Following the Google Cloud speakers was an engaging panel session about Cloud services and cyber risks. The panel was moderated by Antonio Giannino Managing Partner at AmagisTech. The five speakers at the panel were Diane Abela Director of Information Security at Gaming Innovation Group Donald Tabone Group Head of Information Security at Leo Vegas Matthew Sciberras Director of Information Security at Betsson Robert Rychlik Director of Technology at Tipico and Mr. Jason Farrugia Chief Technical Officer of the Malta Gaming Authority.

Thrush is no stranger to challenges. In 2012 under different ownership the company launched a new 500-gallon aircraft powered by the GE H80 turboprop engine. The airframe/engine combination was an instant success with a newly redesigned engine mount that extended the nose and provided exceptional balance in the flight envelope plus spar caps that had a 60000-hour life. However lack of support from the engine manufacturer proved difficult to overcome long term.

Fast forward a little under a decade – Thrush has been “reborn” and the company’s focus has been redefined. Thrush embraced the design success of the 510G airframe and has launched two new aircraft that utilize the existing airframe and its improved engineering – the P2 and the P2+. The aircraft will use the PT6A-34AG and PT6A-140AG turboprop engines boasting 750 and 867 shp respectively. Both aircraft come with a 4 blade prop designed for the application.

The Thrush 510P2/P2+ engines are positioned on slightly modified H80 engine mounts which extend the nose to improve stability and performance over the 510P model. Additional baggage/tool space is also available in the front of the aircraft. Other design changes in the 510P2/P2+ are improved air intake filter arrangements that provide quick access to the filter stainless steel and aluminum hard lines for fuel and oil (eliminating the need to replace hoses in service) and a new electrical harness in the engine compartment. A new air plenum sealing feature that uses “P” seals will provide improved and efficient intake sealing has also been added. The 510P2/P2+ will have new data plates and be available in single and dual-cockpit configurations. Certification and subsequent deliveries are expected in Q4 of 2021 for the single-cockpit versions and in Q1 of 2022 for the dual-cockpit.

Design concepts were well on the drawing board before the 2020 Ag Aviation Expo in Savannah when Thrush President Mark McDonald held a meeting with the array of Thrush dealers in attendance to garner general feedback and suggestions on the upcoming aircraft. Currently there are nine Thrush dealers around the globe: ASI Jet (US) Mid-Continent Aircraft (US) North Star Aviation (US) Yorkton Aircraft (Canada) Aerotec (Argentina) Thrush do Brasil (Brazil) Statewide Aviation (Australia) Orsmond Aviation (South Africa) and Africair (Africa). Final design of the new models began shortly after the convention followed by fabrication and assembly activities. Flight testing on the 510P2+ started in September of 2021. As of this writing over 32 firm orders and dealer slots have been reserved for the new airframes. Dealers are taking orders for those slots now. Thrush expects to increase production by 50% in 2022.

With this increase in production also comes an increase in support. Over the past 15 months wait times for parts have decreased from months to weeks on hard-to-source items. According to McDonald “The new Thrush Aircraft cares about your aircraft from the moment we begin to build it until you retire it.”

In addition to the two new airframe models Thrush Aircraft is also introducing a conversion program for owners of the 510G currently powered by the GE H80 turboprop. Owners will have the option of selecting a new PT6A-34AG engine or one that is owner-provided that must meet specific build specs and be within TBO. The conversion process will take approximately 60 – 75 days to complete. Airframe refurbishment and annual inspections are also available during this process. The conversions are scheduled to begin in November of 2021 with some orders already placed. In 2022 approved international Thrush Service Centers also will perform the conversions.

The 510P2/P2+ brings impressive performance data. Both aircraft have standard 228-gallon fuel tanks and boast a maximum takeoff weight of 10500 lbs. Maneuvering speeds for both airframes are 158 mph never-exceed speed is 186 mph and the maximum flap extension speed is 157 mph. The single-cockpit version has two baggage compartments rated at 100 lbs and 60 lbs. Both airframes’ useful load is approximately 5800 pounds depending on the configuration. The 510P2+ has 117 more horsepower than the earlier model 510P and lighter empty weight.

Thrush factory test pilot Terry Humphrey who has flown every model of Thrush aircraft comments “Pilots are going to be taken back by the performance of these airplanes. The abundance of power coupled with the overall balance of the extended airframe makes the 510P2/P2+ a sports car but with solid Thrush flying characteristics. It is one of the best aircraft I have flown.”

The 510P2/P2+ also have a newly debuted 4-blade Hartzell propeller. The 510P2+’s takeoff RPM is only 1900 and during general working conditions is reduced to 1700. This combined with an overall 103” diameter dramatically slows the prop’s tip speed and equates to a quieter airplane. The 510P2 with the PT6A-34AG is rated at 2080 RPM for takeoff and for working around 1900-1950 RPM. The props are the same for both aircraft.

Full FAA Certification for the new 510P2/P2+ is expected by the end of 2021 and with that will come additional published performance data. Thrush expects to begin delivery immediately upon certification. The company is hosting an open house on December 10th following NAAA’s 2021 Ag Aviation Expo in Savannah to commemorate the aircraft certification. There tours will be given and the opportunity to demo the aircraft will be available to qualified pilots.

The demands of obtaining two new aircraft certifications and rebuilding a company haven’t prevented Thrush Aircraft from focusing on its larger airframe product line the 710P. The 710P program is slated to have many improvements in the upcoming year..

With the ever-present “headwind” of a company rebirth and the refusal to just go along with the status quo Thrush Aircraft has undoubtedly taken off into the wind with the launch of two new aircraft that will indeed serve our industry for years to come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvc3BpY2VqZXQtbGF1bmNoLW1vam9ib3h4LXctaWZlLWVuLXJvdXRlLWFpcmxpbmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Following SpiceJet launch MojoBoxx W-IFE en route to more airlines -,"Last year Indian low-cost carrier SpiceJet began offering complimentary wireless entertainment to passengers’ own devices onboard ten Boeing 737NG aircraft. The solution was developed in partnership with local technology start-up VuLiv a company which has since rebranded as MojoBoxx. Now MojoBoxx founder Manoj Gupta tells Runway Girl Network that this portable W-IFE offering is in place on no fewer than 137 SpiceJet aircraft and will launch across 14 more airlines over the next six months.

“We see the device as a magical box which connects the unconnected at 36000ft above the ground. Mojo translates to magic and hence we changed the name to MojoBoxx: a magical box” Gupta explains in reference to VuLiv’s pivot to the new moniker. The extra “x” in the brand name he adds is for “the X factor” that MojoBoxx gives an airline that chooses to create a magical experience in the air with MojoBoxx.

The technology firm’s initial lightweight portable W-IFE — which launched on SpiceJet under the carrier’s SpiceScreen brand — uniquely features two off-the-shelf Android devices one in the forward galley and one at the rear of the aircraft. The solution is now known as MojoBoxx 1.0. Last year during lockdown Gupta’s team developed MojoBoxx 2.0 a unified single box solution featuring the server and two access points which can be placed in a central position in an aircraft.

In general says Gupta MojoBoxx 1.0 units are a perfect fit for regional and short-haul aircraft with 70-180 seats while MojoBoxx 2.0 units can support long-haul aircraft with 220-330 seats. When the latter box is fully exploited the battery lasts for 22 hours and can be recharged via USB-C to 100% within one hour according to Gupta. Airlines are responsible for charging the units.

Rather than being a cost-center MojoBoxx is programmed to generate ancillary revenues for airlines from Day 1 with Gupta declaring that the inflight experience is “100% CapEx free 100% OpEx free” the type of promise that attracted SpiceJet in the midst of the crushing COVID-19 crisis.

Indeed the MojoBoxx platform is being positioned as a full stack travel ancillary solution for airlines looking to bridge the gap between on-the-ground interactions and inflight interactions. It is monetized via strategic partnerships with travel vertical leaders “in the space of stay eat explore transit and shopping” — not just in-flight but right from the moment a passenger books a ticket at home until they return home according to Gupta. Promotional offers for passengers are a prominent feature.

Specific to SpiceJet the carrier’s pre-order and inflight food and beverage menu is made available on SpiceScreen he says and the application has seen strong take-up. “The adoption rate during the F&B launch touched up to 46% and we expect this to go even higher with the recent launch of [a] mid-air cab booking service or airport shopping and ‘buy now pay later’ services in the upcoming season.”

Indeed the mid-air cab booking service he references has been touted in the press and is the most popular feature on the platform. It allows passengers “to avoid standing in long queues in pandemic times and straight away move to the waiting car at [the] exit gate with zero waiting. The cabs are offered with no cancellation charges and with special fares to airline customers.” This amenity is provided without an inflight Internet connection.

Gupta explains that each unit is provisioned with four channels of cellular connectivity which can be activated when the aircraft lands. And the boxes can be updated “100% remotely for content and usage analytics in real time using our in-house content management system”.

MojoBoxx will compete with a variety of portable W-IFE platforms on the market. But the Northern India company is targeting a specific demographic right now — the large and largely unserved market of budget operators in India and other developing nations around India. Some 14 more airlines operating across India Southeast Asia Middle Eastern markets and countries in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) will deploy MojoBoxx in the next two quarters Gupta reveals.

But MojoBoxx also has legacy airlines and widebody aircraft in its sights with Gupta suggesting to RGN that MojoBoxx 2.0 “is a quick turn around solution to experiment with inflight experience revenues even the seatback entertainment airline can use MojoBoxx’s feather light solutions for second screen travel commerce solutions” such as providing destination information to passengers’ own devices.

The touchless nature of MojoBoxx’s streaming solution might also be particularly attractive to COVID-cautious passengers who may not want to touch a seatback screen.

Bollywood content is obviously a draw for passengers in India as are television programs stand-up routines OTT content children’s specials and travel-related channels — the type of content that SpiceJet now highlights as being part of SpiceScreen on its website. But MojoBoxx has also reached out to Hollywood studios and is “converging on closure with one of the world’s leading studios for our expansion beyond India” says Gupta.

The ""old money"" aesthetic is making a comeback in the new decade a reversal of 2010 new money trends.

The trend is showing up in fashion decor and hobbies among Gen Z and millennials.

It's aspirational and nostalgic and reflects an economy that changed a lot in a short amount of time.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Prep is back and it's bigger than ever.

Think WASPy dinner parties country clubs and summer sailboat vibes. Over the last year Gen Z and millennials have cultivated an ""old money"" aesthetic that romanticizes the aristocratic upper-crust lifestyle and a certain form of privilege untouchable for many.

It says a lot about what people disliked about the decade we just left behind – and what we want the next one to look like.

The aesthetic first gained a foothold among Gen Z who took to TikTok to share ""old money"" inspiration: polo croquet lush gardens and Italian villages. These scenes became inspiration for both fashion and decor: riding boots Gucci crossbody bags floral wallpaper and lots of vintage. Meanwhile millennials picked up leisure-class hobbies like sailing and golfing during the ""solitary leisure"" days of quarantine.

In some ways it's a rejection of the casual new money looks of the 2010s on display both by Instagram influencers and the hoodie-wearing millennial billionaire class. In other ways it's a practical consequence of how a supply shortage and a lockdown changed the economy in ways that will be permanent. And in still another sense it's an expression of escape: away from the traumatic events of the young 2020s and toward a nostalgia for another time.

Old money fashion is aspirational

Oxford shirts tennis skirts and tweed blazers are taking over social media. Gen Z is plastering Ralph Lauren campaign ads from the '90s and vintage tennis photos all over TikTok and Instagram – and they're spending big to recreate the looks.

Vox's Rebecca Jennings first reported on the ""old money"" aesthetic in fashion writing that Gen Z lusts after ""the unapologetically pretentious Ivy League-slash-Oxbridge fourth-cousin-of-a-Kennedy country club vibe.""

TikTok users have rediscovered prep and are driving the trend Morgane Le Caer content lead at Lyst told Insider. The fashion search platform has seen increasing demand for preppy styles. Over the week ending on September 24 searches for leather loafers were up by 28% pleated skirts by 16% Peter Pan collar shirts by 23% and pearl necklaces by 29%.





A post shared by Fashion & fit & OOTD (@phantasyy_)

The trend is also referred to as ""dark academia"" or ""light academia"" depending on the setting La Caer said. ""It embodies the socialite lifestyle represented in culture by shows and films such as 'Gossip Girl' and 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' and is the perfect opposite to the 'California Rich' aesthetic that was made popular by the Kardashian family"" she said.

It's also a response to the casual outfits that typifies the new millennial billionaire class: Dressing in the polished way of a northeastern socialite is ultimately a rejection of the tech CEO's hoodie and sneaker ensemble.

Old money on the walls

The old money aesthetic has also made its way inside homes.

The posh look first took root in form of the ""grandmillennial"" vibe that some millennials gravitated towards pre-pandemic rich in porcelain figurines English antiques chintz wallpaper and brocade curtains. They were seeking décor inspiration everywhere from English country houses to neo-preppy brands like Rodarte.

This maximalist vibe was a response to the minimalist neutral trends that have reigned over Instagram's early days. It picked up during the pandemic as millennials and Gen Z eschewed mass-market home decor for vintage furniture partly a result of supply chain issues and partly as a quest for sustainable and stylish items Insider's Avery Hartmans reported.

Vintage furniture is hot right now.

But the pandemic also morphed the desired look into one with old money vibes. Look no further than The Wall Street Journal's recent advice on decorating with ""old money tastefulness.""

Both trends have the same classic appeal said Alexandria Kochinsky who runs a grandmillennial inspo Instagram account as well as a home organization service but how they manifest in fashion and decor has an important distinction.

The grandmillennial aesthetic she told Insider carries the air of a sophisticated parent or grandparent whereas the old money aesthetic is slightly preppier and more appealing to a younger audience.

""Old money is about projecting an impressive born-into-it wealth whereas grandmillennial can be more sentimental and approachable"" she said. ""If I were to personify the two I'd say Blair Waldorf is a good example of the old money aesthetic and Zsa Zsa Gabor is grandmillennial.""

Old money leisure has taken over

Country clubs yacht clubs and old money hobbies like golfing and boating have enjoyed a pandemic boom.

During quarantine these pastimes replaced the group activities typical of social leisure like amusement parks concerts and crowded bars and restaurants. And they continued to remain popular even as the economy reopened especially as people grew wary of indoor activities again during the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant.

US boat sales hit a 13-year high last year per the National Marine Manufacturers Association with younger first-time boat buyers leading the way. Online resource Discover Boating saw site traffic increase by 90% year-over-year through May among those ages 18- to 24-years-old with millennials comprising the largest number of visitors overall. Experts expect the upswing in interest to last for a long time.

The old money sport of golfing is on the upswing.

A similar story is unfolding out on the green. Golf play in the US increased by 14% from 2019 to 2020 according to Golf Datatech the largest uptick since the industry market research company began tracking the data in 1998. Even spending on golf equipment is on the rise with retail sales up by nearly 50% in June July and August compared to those months two years prior per data from The NPD Group.

Millennials in particular are feeling the pull of the game. In a study by global consulting firm GGA Partners and Nextgengolf 60% of them said golf became more important to them during the pandemic. It found that millennials are also more willing to invest their time and money in the country club lifestyle favoring private clubs – a key part of the old money lifestyle.

The old money aesthetic is a search for nostalgia

The rise of the old money aesthetic is a tale of aspiration but at its roots is a desire for nostalgia. Research has shown that in moments of instability we are more likely to feel nostalgia.

It explains why nostalgia marketing has reached a fever pitch during the pandemic why the wealthy have turned to collectibles as a hobby and why Gen Z sent the world into a Y2K craze. The old money aesthetic is just the latest nostalgic trend reminiscent of a time when WASP culture dominated.

A return to these classic vibes is a backlash to everything that characterized the past decade: the tech billionaires the influencer class and even the experience economy.

But younger generations have lost the ability to escape the tech of the 2010s. They are taking this inspo to the same platforms that spawned the very trends they're rejecting. And ironically they're aspiring to the looks of inherited wealth while lambasting actual generational wealth as income inequality rises during the pandemic.

As author Kurt Andersen wrote in his 2020 book ""Evil Geniuses"" which explored how changes in the postwar economy increasingly encouraged a turn toward nostalgia after the 1960s ""It is ironic how digital technology – newness incarnate the essence of the present and future – has reinforced our fixed backward stare and helped mesmerize us into cultural stasis.""

At its core though the rise of the old money aesthetic signifies a search for a different time period than the one we were just in an escape from the trauma of an unprecedented time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9wc2EtZG8tbm90LWJ1eS1hbi14Ym94LXNlcmllcy1z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PSA: Do not buy an Xbox Series S,"Update: Microsoft might be about to fix the Xbox Series S's biggest problems and let you convert game discs into digital downloads





Last year I almost bought an Xbox Series S. I reserved the console during the first wave of pre-orders thinking it would be an excellent supplemental machine to sit alongside my PS5 but a few weeks from launch I canceled my order.

I ultimately decided not to part with my money because I was and still am unconvinced the entry-level console has a long-term future. The relatively affordable price tag makes it a tempting purchase but its significantly weaker GPU compared to its big brother the Xbox Series X is concerning.

After saving up some extra cash and chasing several restocks I managed to grab an Xbox Series X instead earlier this year. As more next-gen games have launched throughout 2021 my decision to not purchase the Xbox Series S and instead wait until I could afford its more powerful brother has been increasingly validated.

Right now the Xbox Series S makes for a nifty gaming machine but it’s already starting to show its weaknesses. Plus as we get further into this console generation these problems are only going to get worse.

The lesser of the two

To its credit Microsoft has always been extremely upfront when it comes to the Xbox Series S. The tech giant has never claimed the console is capable of the same performance levels as the more expensive Xbox Series X.

The table below lays out the full technical breakdown but the biggest discrepancy between the two machines is easily the GPU. The Xbox Series S sports an AMD RDNA 2 4 teraflops 1.6 GHz which is much less powerful than the beefy AMD RDNA 2 12 teraflops 1.8 GHz found with the Xbox Series X.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Row 0 - Cell 0 Xbox Series X Xbox Series S Price $500 $300 Processor Custom Zen 2 8-core 3.8 GHz Custom Zen 2 8-core 3.8 GHz GPU AMD RDNA 2 12 teraflops 1.8 GHz AMD RDNA 2 4 teraflops 1.6 GHz RAM 16 GB 10 GB Storage 1 TB 512 GB Display (Targeted) 4K 60 fps 1440p 60 fps Display (Max) 8K 120 fps 1440p 120 fps

The two consoles also differ when it comes to RAM and storage capacity. Of course the hard drive size doesn’t impact performance but it does mean the Xbox Series S can only hold a small handful of the best Xbox games before you’ll need to look at alternative storage options.

We’ve tested both consoles extensively found that the Xbox Series X trumps the Xbox Series S in terms of performance in basically all areas. Of course this is hardly surprising but the worrying thing is the performance gulf between the two consoles seems to be growing.

Not quite next-gen enough

Last November when the next-gen Xboxes launched the initial impressions of the Xbox Series S were fairly positive. Even our own Xbox Series S review called it a “surprisingly powerful little console” although we did wisely warn that “it’s not the most future proof gadget you can buy.” These words of warning are starting to ring very true.

While the console seemed to have no problem running early launch games like Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla with a stable 60 fps and in a respectable resolution more recent titles have started to perform pretty poorly on the system.

Most recently FIFA 22 players have been complaining that on Xbox Series S the game is a blurry mess. In fact the resolution is so low that some people can’t even make out the name and numbers on the back of player’s jerseys. The game is in such a bad state some owners have opted to play the Xbox One version instead.

This is far from the first title we’ve seen suffer from performance issues on the Xbox Series S. In April Resident Evil: Village was noted to offer a very poorly implemented ray-tracing mode on the console. The mode is such a CPU drain that the framerate frequently drops to below 30 fps on Xbox Series S.

F1 2021 is another game that had to make compromises on the Xbox Series S. The game targets 1080p on Xbox Series S instead of the 4K target like on PS5 and Xbox Series X. It also doesn’t offer a 120Hz mode on the less powerful console.

Performance issues have also been noted in games like No Man’s Sky Control and eFootball 2022 — although the latter is experiencing a rafter of issues on every platform.

Developers haven’t been shy to comment on the issues that arise when optimizing a game for the Xbox Series S. Last year an employee id Software (a team now actually owned by Microsoft) said “The much lower amount of memory and the split memory banks with drastically slower speeds will be a major issue.” They also noted that just lowering the resolution won’t make up for “the deficiencies.”

Similar comments have been made by a developer at Remedy who noted that optimizing a game for the Series S isn’t as simple as lowering the resolution and texture quality. 4A Games creators of Metro Exodus expressed similar concerns about the console’s weaker GPU.

If developers are having these concerns now imagine the problems that could arise in three or four years' time as games get even more complex and graphically demanding?

It’s only going to get worse

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)

The fact of the matter is that these issues are only going to get worse. Right now we’re still in that crossover period between generations with most flagship games still being released for the Xbox One as well as the new Xbox consoles. In the future that won’t be the case.

Titles like the upcoming Dead Space remake have already been confirmed to be next-gen exclusives which means they’ll push the boundaries of these consoles even further. If the Xbox Series S is already beginning to show cracks with games also playable on eight-year-old hardware will it cope with being pushed even further?

My concerns are that these performance issues will only become more and more common on the Xbox Series S. Right now the majority of games seem to perform admirably on the console with only a handful suffering issues but that pendulum may swing the other way over the next few years.

My advice would be to pony up the additional $200 (if you can afford to) and opt for an Xbox Series X. You might have to pay extra right now but in the long term you’ll be getting a better deal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vaGFja2FkYXkuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMDMvZm9yZ2V0LWRpZ2l0YWwtY29tcHV0aW5nLXlvdS1uZWVkLWFuLWFuYWxvZy1jb21wdXRlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Forget Digital Computing You Need An Analog Computer,"The analog computer of decades-gone-by is something many of us younger engineers never got the chance to experience first hand. It’s pretty much a case of reading about them on these fine pages or perhaps looking at a piece of one behind glass in one of the more interesting museums out there. But now there is another option (THAT) The Analog Thing. Developed by Berlin-based Analog computer-on-chip specialist Anabrid THAT is an Open Source analog computer you can build yourself (eventually) or buy from them fully assembled. At least that’s their plan.

From the 1970s onwards digital computers became powerful enough to replace analog computers in pretty much every area and with the increased accuracy this brought the old analog beasts became obsolete overnight. Now there seems to be a move to shift back a little with hybridized analog-digital approaches looking good for some applications especially where precision is not paramount. After all that pile of fatty grey matter between your ears is essentially a big analog computer and that’s pretty good at problem solving.

Looking over the project Wiki there are a few application examples and some explanatory notes. Schematics are shown albeit only images for now. We can’t find the PCB files either but the assembly instructions show many bodge wires so we guess they’re re-spinning the PCB to apply fixes before releasing them properly. This is clearly work-in-progress and as they say on the main site their focus is on chips for hybrid analog-digital computing with a focus on energy-efficient approximate methods. With that in mind we can forgive that the community-focused learning tools are still being worked on. All that said this is still a very interesting project and definitely would be a Christmas present this scribe would be more than happy to unwrap.

We’ve covered many aspects of analog computing lately like this story of restoration (and ultimately demise) a maritime astrolabe found in the Arabian Sea and even an FPGA simulating an analog computing architecture.

The video shows a simulation of a Lorenz attractor running on THAT slowed down 100x (by changing integrator settings) so that the simulation can run slow enough to be plotted by a mechanical X-Y plotter.",,,,,,

The General Dynamics Mission Systems will deliver a prototype of the Hammerhead system meant to detect and engage anti-submarine warfare targets the Department of Defense said Thursday September 30 2021.

The cost-plus-fixed-fee and firm-fixed-price contract which has a base value of $92.9 million also provides for articles and equipment associated with the Hammerhead technology.

Nearly half of contract work will be conducted at locations in Massachusetts with the remaining being done in Maryland Virginia North Carolina Connecticut Nebraska and Minnesota through September 2023. Efforts could continue up to September 2026 if all options are exercised.

Hammerhead also called an ""encapsulated effector"" is designed to destroy anti-submarine assets. It is designated both a middle-tier acquisition rapid prototyping program and a Navy maritime accelerated acquisition program according to the statement. Those designations grant the program certain authorities to streamline acquisition.



The new Hammerhead mine is designed to lie in wait on the seabed floor listening for the telltale signs of enemy submarines. Once a foe passes over Hammerhead unleashes a homing torpedo that hunts down and destroys the offending sub. Laid in the path of enemy ships sea mines can slow passage through vital areas or deny transit entirely.

America’s F-22 Raptor is one of the world’s most advanced warplanes. But it has several weaknesses. For one it’s blind in the infrared though several of its potential rivals have infrared-search-and-track sensors effectively allowing them to scan for enemy warplanes’ heat signatures.

The last U.S. fighter to have an IRST sensor built in during development was the F-14 Tomcat. The F/A-18 Super Hornet now has the option of carrying a centerline droptank with an IRST which will make it expensive to actually drop in combat.

The F-22 also lacks side-looking radars which allow an aircraft to fire a missile that requires mid-course updates from the aircraft’s radar while continuing to provide tracking data after turning more than 90 degrees away from the path of the missile.

Without such a radar an aircraft would have to keep pointing toward an enemy plane — and getting closer to any missiles an enemy might fire.

The reason for these shortcomings dates back to the Raptor’s origin.

The F-22 had its beginnings in the Advanced Tactical Fighter program which began in 1981. The U.S. Air Force awarded General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas contracts for initial design work for an air-to-ground fighter that could fly at Mach 2.5 at high to medium altitudes and carry standoff weapons to destroy tanks and other ground targets.

Nothing came of that program initially because the F-16 Fighting Falcon originally designed as an air-to-air fighter for daylight hours came in the back door and was repurposed to fill the air-to-ground role.

In late 1985 the U.S. Air Force made a number of changes to requirements as the program progressed including a greater emphasis on stealth. It also changed the selection process so that instead of four companies receiving approximately $100 million each two would be awarded contracts of $700 million each to produce flying prototypes.

One of the prototypes would be powered by Pratt & Whitney F119 engines and the other with General Electric F120 engines. At around the same time the U.S. Air Force sent out letters to the competing companies to encourage teaming.

The idea behind this was that the U.S. Air Force wanted as much talent as possible for such a large and expensive program. As a result Boeing Lockheed and General Dynamics formed one team and Northrop and McDonnell Douglas formed another. Rockwell and Grumman did not team.

On Oct. 31 1986 the Air Force announced Lockheed and Northrop as winners of that stage of the Advanced Tactical Fighter program. The teaming agreement among Boeing General Dynamics and Lockheed called for the winning company to be the team leader so Lockheed took that role. The winning teams were given four years to produce their flying prototypes.

Lockheed’s design at this stage had a large rotary weapon bay which pushed the engines and inlets outward in turn producing an excessive amount of wave drag. This is exactly what happened to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter with its vertical lift fan making the aircraft too wide and draggy. The vertical lift fan is the original sin of the F-35 design.

The Air Force initially required that eight missiles be carried internally within the F-22’s main weapon bay. That was reduced to six when both of the design teams concluded this could not be done effectively. Similarly the requirement for thrust reversers was dropped when it was determined that the capability was not worth the price in performance.

The F-22’s basic challenge was to integrate stealth supercruise highly integrated avionics and agility into an aircraft with a longer range than the one it was to replace the F-15 Eagle. It was also to have twice the reliability of the F-15 and half the support requirements. Although in practice the F-22’s mission availability has risen over the last few years to being close to that of the F-15 but its support requirement is over 50 percent higher.

Both the Lockheed and Northrop designs had diamond-shaped wings with a long root chord joining the wing to the fuselage providing a more distributed load path and more bulkheads carrying the bending loads. The large wings also provided more fuel volume.

But in January 1989 the U.S. Air Force put a cap on the cost of the F-22’s avionics at $9 million per aircraft in production. At that time Lockheed’s paper design had over $16 million of avionics in each aircraft.

Thus the IRST was dropped — as were a number of other systems including the side-looking cheek-mounted radars.

The processing power of electronics and the acuity of optics have improved in the last decade so the cost of avionics relative to the cost of the airframe has fallen. Nevertheless the reason why the F-22 doesn’t have an IRST dates from the avionics cost cap imposed in 1989. The U.S. Air Force didn’t prescribe which systems were to be dropped in order to meet the cap. The companies decided what would provide the best value for money.

And 27 years later the F-22’s main competition the Russian Su-35 Flanker-E has infrared-search-and-track and cheek-mounted radars.

It is also one of the most widespread as the General Dynamics (now Lockheed Martin) machine is presently fielded by the Air Forces of close to 30 nations.

Over the decades more than 4500 such airplanes were made and that means there are plenty of images and videos of the thing around. This however does not diminish in any way the appeal the F-16 continues to have and given U.S. Air Force (USAF) airmen’s talent for taking photos at just the right moment continues to impress every time it’s shown.The main photo of this piece was taken on a night back in August just as a single-seat F-16C variant of the plane was preparing to take off from the Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada for a Red Flag-Nellis 21-3 mission The airplane is deployed with the 64th Aggressor Squadron  a unit tasked with acting as sparring partners for other pilots during training.F-16 pilots like to call their planes Vipers partially on account of various associations with a starfighter featured in the Battlestar Galactica sci-fi series. It can’t leave Earth’s atmosphere of course but the single afterburning turbofan engine (either a General Electric or a Pratt & Whitney depending on configuration) is more than capable of taking these metal birds at speeds of Mach 2 and for distances of about 2620 miles (4217 km).Packing guns rockets missiles and a wide range of targeting systems the F-16s were involved over the years in over 13 million sorties and some 19.5 million flight hours. There is no exact figure on the number of kills the family is responsible for but it did see its share of action in the hottest places on the globe including in Iraq Afghanistan Libya or Syria."

Kurt Stiles knows all too well what it means when your business is your life.

And then it isn’t.

At one time he owned several Moosehopper Bakery Café locations. He also did consulting research and development for such brands as General Mills Sara Lee Marriot Subway Coca-Cola and Land O' Lakes. He served as director of research and development for Minnesota-based coffee chain Caribou Coffee in the early 2000s when the company went from 40 to 268 stores. In 2006 he started his own company Good for You Ingredients and launched a line of gluten-free bars and cookie mixes on December 1 2008.

Just 16 days later his life would be forever altered.

Stiles suffered a massive stroke on December 17 2008. He watched as all the things he built crumbled around him. “My wife Molly and I had a $450000 loan and lost it because of my stroke” Stiles recalls. “I ordered three truckloads of products for my mix. I had three employees and a warehouse and then it was gone—my house my car warehouse…all gone.”

Molly remembers that time all too well. “He was truly at the top of his game” she recalls. “He sat on three culinary boards was making products had a contract with QVC and was writing 26 episodes of a cooking show then had this massive stroke. We invested all this money thinking that between the TV show QVC and his consulting we’d make it all back.”

Starting from Scratch

“After my stroke I was slight paralyzed on my right side” Stiles says. “My job now and in the last five years is [working on] my speech. Every day. The doctor told me ‘Do not drive. Do not work.’... I researched online and started [learning about] Chinese medicine. I immediately changed my food plan to heavy fresh juice vegetables herbs several supplements no red meat and lower [amounts of] white meat.”

Stiles used several machines that he found through research including a hyperbaric chamber electrostatic therapy machine and a machine known as a BEMER which targets circulation within muscle tissue. “Stroke survivors don’t know about the resources out there for them"" he says ""and doctors can’t confidently stand behind taking alternative medicine and [using] machines and changing what you eat."" By adding these tools to his arsenal however Stiles says he began to recover.

Expand Courtesy Molly and Kurt Stiles Molly and Kurt Stiles in August 2020

""He did rehab every single day for the first five years"" recalls Molly. ""He just kept getting better and better.”

Though his speech was still limited he began introducing himself to farmers at local farmers’ markets via writing on a white board or using pictures to communicate. This led to some strong relationship-building that would serve him years later after some of his functions began to return.

While working on his speech he had to overcome another challenge: He forgot how to cook.

“He had to make a box of brownies [as part of his recovery] and they gave him a box mix” Molly recalls. “Even though he used to create recipes for box mixes like that when he first started out he could not make a box of brownies. The first meal he made me was spaghetti and he forgot to drain the grease off of it. It was awful. Then he made tacos. We could not eat them. He made them too spicy. He couldn’t taste spices. While other people have to learn to walk he had to learn how to do the thing he could do in his sleep: cook.”

Several of his friends who were peers in the Research Chefs Association taught Stiles how to cook again. “They brought all their pans and spices” Molly recalls. “The things he had been teaching to so many for so long they had to teach him to do again.”

Over time his ability to taste began to return. “He regained his speech and his ability to create"" says Molly. He wrote a cookbook that shared his journey Cooking to Save Your Life.

In 2018 he earned a master’s in nutrition and dietetics with an emphasis in food innovation and entrepreneurship from Saint Louis University. Still finding work proved difficult. “I was itching to work again” he says. “My stroke has made things difficult. Interviewing has been hard because of my stroke. I applied for over 300 jobs across the country and interviewed for 60 of them but wasn’t offered any.”

Then Stiles received a grant to launch a startup based on a novel idea: Pure Plant Jerky was born.

A New Chapter

To Stiles it made sense to create plant-based jerky a product that would teach others about using food as medicine and reducing meat consumption. Of the dozen or so companies that existed he says a few were using watermelon jackfruit and mushrooms but many were using soy products and chemicals.

Pure Plant Jerky uses no chemicals and is GMO- cholesterol- gluten- and allergy-free he says and it supports a healthy diet. Although his products aren’t certified organic Stiles says he uses such suppliers as O’Fallon Missouri–based Mushrooms Naturally which avoids chemicals and pesticides.

“I have three whole-foods jerky products"" he says. ""Mushrooms have over 100 antioxidants and umami which is an incredible flavor from the mushrooms. Shiitake is the best mushroom for flavor and protein. Plus it mirrors meat [in its texture].”

“Once people started tasting his plant jerky they were asking him to make it for them and encouraging him to sell it” says Molly who now serves as president of Chef Pure Foods the maker of Pure Plant Jerky which officially launched this April.

The Brussels sprouts jerky with Middle Eastern spice is his biggest seller and a labor of love: Stiles cuts each sprout by hand which takes him four hours on average to make enough for 48 small bags or 25 large bags. The second best-seller is smoked maple bacon-flavored eggplant jerky. He also offers shroomy pizza-flavored shiitake mushroom jerky and is excited to offer a new product: grilled zucchini with non-dairy cheese and dill. “Our 15-year-old loves the new flavor and he doesn’t like anything” Molly says with a laugh.

He also appreciates hearing from customers. “People come up"" he says ""and tell me ‘My dad has diabetes my mom had a stroke my cousin has cancer and my passion [now] is getting people to switch to plant-based products.'""

The jerky can currently be found at area farmers' markets and events. “We do the Lake St. Louis Farmers Market and have done Tuesdays at Tower Grove [Farmers' Market]” he says. “We have done local festivals and sold at a few breweries. We branched out to some markets in Minnesota this summer and had great response.” On October 24 he plans to attend St. Louis VegFest and then holiday markets later in the year.

Stiles eventually hopes to expand the business. For the moment he works out of a 100-square-foot FDA-approved commercial kitchen space in High Ridge which he rents from local company Two Men and a Garden. His culinary colleagues also share their slicer so Stiles can prepare the eggplant-based jerky.

By next January Stiles hopes to find funding to help purchase equipment which would allow him to offer six products. He plans to use the post-farmers’ market season to focus on growth. His dream is to one day sell Pure Plant Jerky at such places as Green Bean local co-ops and eventually Target.

“My wife thought this was just going to be a hobby” he says. “I always ask her ‘How’s my hobby doing for you?’”

Born in Brainerd Mills spent his formative years in the city and surrounding lakes area. While based here he and twin brother Henry “Hank” Mills II built over 61 years what would become a retail business empire sprawled across four states. His philanthropy boosted countless organizations and worthy causes in Brainerd and beyond the vast majority of his donations made anonymously. And on Sept. 24 surrounded by loved ones his life came to a close where it began in the community he so cherished.

“You just can’t say enough about that man and what he has done in his career what he did for his company what he’s done for this community and what he did for all the people that work with him” said Bruce Buxton a retired consultant with Widseth Smith Nolting whose business relationship with Mills evolved into a 35-year close friendship. “He’s special he’s one of the patriarchs of this community. He’s probably the last one that I know of in the area that’s been here and done as much for this community as anybody. So this community will miss him.”

Daughter Marisa Mills who worked closely with her father throughout her life and considered him her best friend said one of his most admirable traits was the ease with which he demonstrated what he expected from others around him including her and her two brothers Stewart and Travis both publicly and privately.

“He was kind compassionate. He was fair he was loving. But he was very firm and wasn’t going to tolerate us being any less than our best and wasn’t going to tolerate us not having a certain code of character and a certain code of conduct a certain code of values that we were to live by” Marisa said. “And I really embraced that. I deeply still and always will admire my dad. I always did since I was a little girl.

“The things that he told me and shared with me and the things that he demonstrated — forget just what he told me but the things that I witnessed — I had the great blessing of living my life very close to him for my 46 and a half years … and I got to see how he really was behind the scenes. He really acted out the great character that he was also wanting from others around him.”

Former Minnesota Vikings head coach Bud Grant 94 shared the love of football and the outdoors with Mills and together they went on a number of hunting and fishing trips while “solving the world’s problems” Grant said.

“He was a down-to-earth person and a really good person. I mean you have a lot of friends or acquaintances in your life and some of them they’re your friends or you work with them in spite of.

A strong foundation

Born Sept. 8 1928 to Stewart C. and Helen K. Mills in Brainerd Stewart C. Mills Jr.’s early years were defined by two foundational relationships — the one with his father who demonstrated the values of hard work and integrity after starting the Mills family dynasty in 1922 with auto dealerships in downtown Brainerd and the one with his grandmother Nana Mae who taught him to respect and thrive in the outdoors and set high expectations for her grandson he would later epitomize throughout his life.

The young Mills lived with Nana Mae for a period of time as a child splitting his time between Nisswa in the summers and during the school year in Brainerd where he attended Whittier Elementary School Franklin Junior High School and Brainerd High School.

“His family was so important to him and his heritage and knowing his family and being with his family and doing right by his family and carrying on a legacy for his family — all of that was so important” Marisa said. “ … He just loved and adored both of them and I think he truly just wanted to be the best he could be for them too.”

He was a talented Warriors football player but a self-admitted poor student skipping classes to go hunting and getting in trouble for pulling pranks. Buxton said Mills often regaled friends with amusing stories of his teenage years including the time he and some classmates placed an outhouse on the roof of a school building in honor of Halloween.

Despite his penchant for mischief he graduated from BHS in 1946 and continued his education graduating from Brainerd Junior College in 1948 and attending the University of Minnesota from 1948-49 before taking some time off to explore Alaska. He completed his college education at Hamline University graduating in 1951 with a major in business administration.

Carl Boberg of Nisswa who at 91 years old said he’s likely one of the few people left in the area who knew Mills and his brother as teenagers recalled Mills as a regular party host and purveyor of good old-fashioned fun. He was gregarious mesmerizing guests with his quick wit and magnetic personality. The two remained friends throughout the decades with Mills calling upon Boberg and his brothers to ride in a steamboat float in Nisswa parades and later serving as a pallbearer for both of Boberg’s brothers’ funerals.

“Everybody loved Stew. It didn’t make any difference if the ladies were 19 or 90 they just loved him” Boberg said. “He was the life of the party.”

Yet even in the midst of youth Mills remained focused. Boberg said no matter how much fun there was to be had Mills would be in bed by midnight ready for work the next day.

Mills was also a member of the 194th Tank Battalion and the Minnesota National Guard before enlisting in the Army where he served until 1959. He graduated from the U.S. Army Adjutant General School and was selected to represent enlisted men at the official lighting of the Christmas tree by President Harry Truman at the nation’s capital. He worked as an Army drill instructor in Fort Riley Kansas and spent two years stationed in Heidelberg Germany where he directly served a two star general.

In 1955 in pursuit of a business of their own the Mills brothers settled on farmers as their customer base and looked to the dairy mecca of Wisconsin as a starting point. After driving the countryside themselves and speaking directly to those tending their herds in Marshfield Wisconsin — home to the largest dairy cow population in the country at the time — the pair opened the first Fleet Wholesale Supply.

Mills told the Dispatch in 2016 that in the beginning they started buying and advertising merchandise farmers said they needed and went on to begin leasing stores. They were known for going out and jumping on tractors to learn what their customers used and what they wanted and needed.

In 1959 the business became Mills Fleet Farm and by the time the family sold it to global investment firm KKR in 2016 35 retail locations hummed along in Minnesota Wisconsin Iowa and North Dakota.

Business brilliance



While he earned a degree in business Mills attributed his acumen to what he learned by working for his father. Throughout his life Mills struggled to accept praise or take credit for his success. For him all roads led to Stewart Sr. In 2016 upon receiving recognition as the first recipient of the Brainerd Lakes Chamber Business Legacy Award Mills questioned whether he truly deserved the honor in an interview with the Dispatch.

“With my dad it had to be honesty and integrity and you will do what’s right” Mills said at the time. “I look back ... there is no story. I am no story because it’s my dad. The only thing I was was smart enough to listen to him and get to work.”

Stewart C. Mills Jr. Contributed

Friends and business associates of Mills’ would disagree with this personal assessment. Those who witnessed him in action pointed to an unmatched attention to detail and an uncanny intuition about what customers wanted.

“He was a hell of a retailer” said Bart Harmer who first met Mills as a young businessman and a member of the Brainerd Jaycees before he went on to work for the Mills Automotive Group. “You’d go to a convenience store and you’d spend two hours in the convenience store because he’d walk up and down every single aisle looking at what they have and what they’re selling and why they’re selling it and how they’re merchandising it. He just never ever stopped thinking about that kind of stuff.

“He was always trying to get better himself. It wasn’t just trying to make sure everybody else could be the best they could be he was well into his high 80s and he was still trying to be the best version of himself he could be.”

Buxton who spent countless hours on the road with Mills traveling to potential future store locations as well as visiting existing stores said he was a prolific note-taker who noticed even the smallest of details and was intimately involved in the designs of his buildings both the Fleet Farm locations and the auto dealerships.

“He’s a wonderful man when it comes to seeing things that nobody else will see” Buxton said. “When he built that store as an example in Baxter everybody said it was a tribute to his father and he was going to fail. Obviously it was a tribute to his father but he sure didn’t fail.”

Mills’ success in business didn’t stop at how he filled the shelves — it extended to the culture he cultivated. He set high standards and expected his employees to treat their customers with respect and fairness. He returned that respect and fairness to his employees as well listening to their ideas and recognizing their efforts.

During the 1997 Red River flood with generators and pumps at a premium in Fargo-Moorhead and other retailers raising their prices Mills refused to go with the flow. Buxton said Mills asked him to fill a van with merchandise from the Baxter store and drive it to the Fargo location where it remained at the typical prices.

“He sold it at exactly what he would have sold it anyway and in so doing he cemented his relationship with that town over there. Before it was just another store and they had many choices and everything but because he maintained his prices and didn’t try to gouge everybody he was fair” Buxton said. “And that’s what he always wanted to be was fair. He said ‘Be the best you can be. Always be fair and do what’s right.’ And that’s the way he was.”

Harmer said when he trains new employees at Mills Automotive Group Mills’ philosophies flow through the process from the beginning.

“I always talk about the responsibility and the accountability and the honesty and the integrity” Harmer said. “ … There’s just so many stories that can teach somebody a life lesson on how to operate not only personally but professionally. I don’t miss an opportunity to say what we call ‘Stew-isms’ around here. … He would always say ‘Get it done.’ ‘Do what’s right.’ ‘Be the best you could be.’”

More to the man

Outside of the office Mills was a regular Renaissance man. He voraciously consumed books on history especially those related to the military. He was excellent on a pair of skis whether by water or on the slopes. Hunting was a lifelong fascination that took him all over the world from hunting snow geese in Canada to big game in Africa. He served on the board of directors for the Green Bay Packers and Lambeau Field bore the Mills name on one of its gates.

His travels often focused on trips to historical sites including Civil War battlefields and a trip to the Philippines. There in 2007 he and daughter Marisa drove along the same route as his 194th Tank Battalion forebears did in the Bataan Death March. Marisa said her father took extra care to visit every one of the markers and gravestones of the Brainerd men and women involved in that dark chapter of World War II history.

“That’s how sensitive and passionate about those things he was and emotional about those things — he had to go and it was a way for him to also pay respect” Marisa said. “ … He grew up in that era where he saw what these people really did for our country and knew that some of them didn’t come back.

“ … My dad is like the equivalent of as far as age wise he waited until a lot later to have me. So he’s kind of like an equivalent age of a grandfather. What a blessing for me to know and to get all that history directly from my dad.”

“I can say this with some real authority — people here will never know how much he did in this community because he was quite a humble person really."" — Terry McCollough

Former Brainerd Dispatch Publisher Terry McCollough who grew up family friends with the Mills family and later became close friends with Stewart Mills Jr. himself pointed to Mills’ comfort with showing his emotion as a perhaps lesser-known facet of his personality.

This was especially the case when it came to honoring the troops. While handing out thousands of American flags during Fourth of July parades was a hallmark of Mills Fleet Farm’s presence and a number of Mills’ donations supported military-related endeavors that was just his public patriotism. At barbecues he hosted for friends and family the bonfire conversation would inevitably turn to storytelling of the heroism of his guest’s family members or even themselves. McCollough recalled sharing stories of his own parents’ service in World War II at these events.

“He would always say ‘Let’s talk about why we’re here. Let’s talk about the people that defended this country and made sure that we can celebrate the Fourth of July and that we’re speaking English rather than some other language — German Japanese whatever’” McCollough said. “ … He invariably would have tears running down his cheek when he would be talking about the military what they did and how important it was to him. So I think that was an emotional side that the average person might not have seen from this tough businessman — you know the ability to cry over something that was really important and really meant a lot.”

McCollough noted Mills reached out to him when his son Col. Bill McCollough was deployed to Afghanistan in 2009 asking what he and his battalion of 1200 Marines needed. When he learned a good pair of boot socks would be helpful Mills wasted no time dropping off 1200 pairs at the Dispatch offices. Mills’ longtime girlfriend Andre Margaux a businesswoman in her own right contributed to the effort as well providing 1200 neck coolers for the troops.

This was just one of perhaps hundreds of examples of Mills’ philanthropy for which he did not seek accolades.

“I can say this with some real authority — people here will never know how much he did in this community because he was quite a humble person really” McCollough said.

‘I owe everything to him and to God’

Of everything Mills was his role as a father stood out to his friends and associates — his love for his children was clear in how he went about his daily life.

Marisa who is carrying on the family business as an owner of Mills Automotive Group said she could never thank her father enough for his influence how he always treated her equally with her brothers and the example he set for how to conduct oneself in business and in life.

“When somebody does so much and gives so much — and I don’t mean external material things — when they give so much of themselves in teaching and values and foundation and thought processes and really sets you or orients you a different way than maybe you would’ve landed on your own you just have all of this debt of gratitude” Marisa said. “ … I owe everything to him and to God and I know my dad felt that way too. He owed everything to his dad his Nana and to God. He didn’t take a lot of credit even though he deserved it. He was the driving force behind all of it for all of those years and that’s just the truth.”

Mills is survived by his children Marisa Mae Mills (Gus); sons Stewart C. Mills III (Heather) and Travis D. Mills Sr.; grandchildren Travis D. Mills Jr. Christian S. Mills Stewart C. Mills IV and Jade D. Mills; longtime girlfriend Andre Margaux; and dog Max.

Memorials are preferred and appreciated to the Salvation Army or Shriner’s Children Hospital.

A celebration of life will be at a later date.

The city is a symbol of freedom and a center of culture finance media cuisine and fashion. Here you can walk the streets that double as movie sets. In 300 square miles you’ll find every imaginable nationality language and tradition. Status and romance lights and energy a place to make an impact and cement a legacy — New York is where you have everything in reach and you never miss out.

It can be easy to forget that New York is far more than the five boroughs. Just look at the Finger Lakes region. Stretching from Rochester and Syracuse in the north to Ithaca in the south the Finger Lakes is a mad mix of farmer’s markets wineries and festivals all surrounded by rolling hills picturesque paths and towering waterfalls. On the southern tip of Cayuga Lake you’ll find an Ivy League MBA powerhouse: Cornell University’s Johnson Graduate School of Management. Think of it as an Ivy that caters to MBAs who want to get away from it all…but is still just four hours from New York City. Away from being stacked and packed Cornell MBAs can focus explore learn and network supported by deep resources and world-class faculty.

“ITHACA HAS JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING I NEED”

Kielyn Jarvis re-located from big bad Boston to join the Cornell Johnson MBA Class of 2023. One reason he says is the Finger Lakes location. “The uninterrupted natural beauty of the Finger Lakes region is a welcome reprieve from all the brick and concrete the din of traffic and the light pollution of city living” he tells P&Q. “As an (amateur) photographer I’m most excited to capture as much of that natural beauty as possible. I plan to bring my camera on every hike to the waterfalls and hidden swimming holes and to the wineries during my time at Johnson.”

Jarvis isn’t the only one indulging in Ithaca’s charms. Growing up near Los Angeles Justin Liu became a U.S. Navy nuclear officer for a carrier ported in Japan. For him Cornell’s setting enables the class for forge deeper connections. “Going to school in a major city can lead to students scattering off on their own” he observes. “Ithaca has just about everything I need and the Finger Lakes and nearby mountains offer a perfect medium to spend quality time with the Johnson community. We have already taken advantage of the several hikes and visited wineries and breweries by the lakes.”

That doesn’t mean that Johnson MBAs are roughing it in the wilderness all alone. After all Ithaca is home to nearly 31000 people. That doesn’t count 23000 students with nearly 40% being graduate or professional students. The university itself employs over 1700 faculty members across 16 different schools. At the same time the MBA program maintains a dual campus model through its Cornell Tech campus. In this program which P&Q honored as its MBA Program of The Year in 2017 multidisciplinary teams partner with top firms in New York City.

“Cornell Tech’s incredible Roosevelt Island campus includes state-of-the-art resources and facilities for Johnson students. Its location means direct access to midtown for networking with peers alumni and top recruiters” notes Dean Mark Nelson in a 2020 interview.

THE PEOPLE AND CULTURE

Yes Cornell MBAs can ‘detox’ amid four distinct seasons and outdoor activities galore. However Johnson’s biggest calling card may be its culture. That was the two year takeaway from Ola Esho a 2021 MBA graduate and U.S. Army veteran who ultimately landed her dream job at Deloitte.

“Have you ever met an insanely brilliant person who expects great things from you but instead of feeling pressure or anxiety from their expectations you feel incredibly up to the task and capable” she asks. “That is what Johnson feels like. When I visited the school for the first time and interacted with the students faculty and staff I felt challenged to achieve more. At the same time I felt it was a place that would equip me to achieve my goals. Around Sage Hall there is palpable sense of passion excellence and community from everyone in the building. It was immediately apparent that this was a place where I could learn and grow and fail forward with the most supportive group of people. As cliché as it may sound I chose Johnson because of its people and its culture.”

That trend continues with the Class of 2023 who continue Cornell Johnson’s penchant for diverse and accomplished classes. Take Gabriella Del Río-Dávila a Puerto Rico native who took up ballet three years ago and can already dance on pointe. Before being a consultant for Nielsen IQ she led campaigns for some of the most prominent bands in the food industry.

“[I] was driving successful brand activations and surpassing sales targets for Haagen-Dazs Old El Paso Cheerios and other cereals in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean while being the youngest brand manager in General Mills LATAM team at the time” she tells P&Q. “If I had to choose just one moment it would be the launch of Lucky Charms Frosted Flakes cereal which disrupted the largest segment of the category and brought a 2pp value share increase to General Mills.”

FROM HARVARD TO CORNELL

In contrast Tommy Ott was a company commander in the U.S. Army where he flew UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters. However his first flight was far different than his day-to-day. That’s because he was an air medevac patient. “In my senior year of high school my carotid artery was severely torn during an ice hockey game and had to be flown to a regional hospital for immediate attention in a specialized neurological trauma center.”

Then again Kielyn Jarvis comes from competitors of Cornell Johnson in the MBA space. He spent 5 years with MIT Sloan and (more recently) 3 years with Harvard Business School. In his last role he served as the online learning manager for the Harvard Business Analytics program. Here he transformed the school’s three-day immersions where roughly 200 students head to Harvard’s campus for in-person learning and networking.

“The pandemic made an in-person experience impossible” he admits. “This forced many participants to defer which impacted our bottom line. Rather than mirror what we’d do on-campus I took it upon myself to structure a completely different experience around the core academic components more amenable to a virtual environment. I had to lean into my experience leading complex projects managing distributed teams and communicating effectively with multiple stakeholder groups (internal team faculty technical partners at 2U vendors and program participants). I was able lead six successful virtual immersions refining operations with each iteration.”

And the best part of this transition? “It was a particular joy that an immersion coincided with my last week at the Harvard Business Analytics Program” Jarvis adds “and that I prepared my team well enough to run the immersion seamlessly without me.”

PANDEMIC BECOMES A WAKE UP CALL

Natalia Rovira Rodrigues also left her mark in academia. She “spearheaded” the re-launch of Princeton in Asia’s fellowships for India which provided work experience to two cohorts of students. By the same token Sameer Jain established a maritime university that now trains over 300 cadets annually. At the same time Nicole de Ovin-Berenguer managed a $6 million dollar kitchen in a New York City landmark. While Dr. Vanessa Nwaokocha’s research has been honored by the American College of Physicians Oregon chapter she takes her greatest pride in her service as a practicing resident physician during COVID-19.

“To say that I was frontline and had a hand in saving many lives during what seems to be an unending pandemic is truly an achievement” she explains. “How many pandemics does one live through? I’d like to also highlight my co-residents at PPMC and really all resident physicians around the United States because such a sacrifice so early in our career where we are overworked and severely underpaid is not acknowledged nearly enough.

Indeed the Class of 2023 didn’t huddle at home to wait out the pandemic. Like Nwaokocha many sprang into action. Sameer Jain started a foundation to provide mobile devices to low income children so they could take online classes. When India went into lockdown Surbhi Vijay Bhavsar worked alongside a member of parliament to re-write his state’s Climate Change Action Plan. Still the pandemic also served as a time to reflect on the careers and values. Kielyn Jarvis for one vowed to embrace the ambiguous and unknown in his career rather than evading risks and seeking safety. For Gabriella Del Río-Dávila COVID-19 was a reminder that resting isn’t slacking.

“The first few months during quarantine I learned to savor slow weekend mornings where I could read novels and enjoy stress free time without the pressure of always having to do something or be somewhere” she writes. “Our society has taught us that being busy is good and that if you’re not then you’re lazy and wasting time. The pandemic has taught me that there is beauty and value in resting and disconnecting. I will carry this lesson with me as I begin my MBA journey. Career-wise it confirmed that I need to work for a company that is flexible empathetic respectful and understanding of their employees across all levels.”

GM,General Motors,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVlcC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvY2Fycy9nZW5lcmFsLW1vdG9ycy8yMDIxLzEwLzAzL2dtLXJlYWR5LXJlc29sdmUtbGF3c3VpdC1hZ2FpbnN0LWZvcmQtb3Zlci1ibHVlY3J1aXNlLW5hbWUvNTk4NTAyMzAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM ready to resolve lawsuit against Ford over BlueCruise name,"General Motors is ending its lawsuit against Ford Motor Co. over the use of a single word: cruise.

The battle started in July when GM sued Ford for copyright infringement saying Ford's name for its hands-free driving system BlueCruise too closely resembled GM's self-driving car subsidiary Cruise and GM's Super Cruise its hands-free driving system that it introduced in 2012 and launched in 2017.

On Sunday night GM told the Free Press the lawsuit had been resolved amicably but declined to release any final terms. A Ford spokesman said the settlement is still in process but made a comment that indicated future use of the word BlueCruise may continue on future Ford cars.

The comments come after lawyers for the automakers filed a notice of settlement with U.S. District Court Northern District California on Friday saying the parties are working out terms of a settlement. The notice requested a conditional dismissal and the two sides have 60 days to report back to the court if they’re unable to come to an agreement.

On Sunday evening GM spokesman Darryll Harrison told the Free Press ""The parties have resolved the case and related proceedings amicably and will have no further comment.”

Ford spokesman Mike Levine could not confirm that any settlement terms have been finalized and said ""We’re planning to settle the lawsuit with GM and have no further comment at this time.""

When asked to clarify GM's statement in light of the fact that the terms have not been fully finalized Harrison said ""Our on-the-record stands.""

But a clue that Ford will be keeping the use of the name BlueCruise as part of the settlement comes in Levine's comments to the Free Press that Ford will share more news at a later date about BlueCruise technology coming to additional Ford vehicles.

""In addition we recently announced that BlueCruise will be available for the new 2022 Ford Expedition and it is already available for Mustang Mach-E and F-150"" Levine said.

Ford announced BlueCruise in April soon a legal battle ignited in July when GM filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against Ford over the name.

In the complaint GM said it had been in “protracted discussions” with Ford over the name but were unable to come to agreement. GM's Cruise self-driving subsidiary has been in business since 2013.

In August Ford filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that the term “cruise” was “ubiquitous"" for driver-assist features a term that's been in use for 50 years and that consumers associate with many carmakers. Levine has called GM’s trademark claims “meritless and frivolous” and Ford petitioned the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office asking GM’s trademarks of “Cruise” and “SuperCruise” be rescinded.

On Sept. 10 U.S. District Judge Susan Illston cast doubt over GM's move to block Ford's use of the term BlueCruise during a hearing for GM's preliminary injunction blocking Ford from using BlueCruise.

""I feel like the likelihood of success on the merits is unclear to me at this point. It seems to me there are validity issues about the idea of using the Cruise designation and the mark Super Cruise since it was -- I think there is substantial evidence it was used before in a -- in a more generic framework and it seems to me that Super Cruise for example is far more generic or descriptive than anything else and ditto with Cruise"" Illston said according to a transcript from the hearing.

The judge said evidence of confusion over the word ""cruise"" is lacking.

""I'm unclear about likelihood of success on the merits and that's the primary thing that would incline me to deny the motion"" Illston said.

She also noted ""I personally take a jazz cruise every now and then and occasionally there is a blues cruise"" she said. ""I'm just saying the words you chose to use as your own are used by other people all the time.""

Ford and General Motors to settle trademark fight over hands-free driving

The tit-for-tat legal skirmish began in July when GM sued Ford for violating its trademarked driver-assist technology. It said it was taking action to protect its ""Super-Cruise"" brand and ""Cruise"" the name of its self-driving affiliate Cruise LLC after Ford in April renamed its Co-Pilot360 automated driving system as ""BlueCruise""...",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vamFsb3BuaWsuY29tLzM0LXllYXItb2xkLWxhdXJhLXdvbnRyb3Ata2xhdXNlci1pc250LWludGltaWRhdGVkLWJ5LWgtMTg0Nzc4OTg0MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,34-Year-Old Laura Wontrop Klauser Isn't Intimidated By Her Role As GM's Sports Car Racing Program Manager,"What were you doing when you turned 34? If you’re Laura Wontrop Klauser you’ve just been made Sports Car Racing Program Manager at General Motors which means you’re not only overseeing American-based motorsport efforts but you’re also about to start building a car capable of winning at Le Mans. That’s not a bad gig.

“Right about the age 13 I decided that I wanted to work for one of the big three GM Ford or Chrysler. And I wanted to be a part of working on cars” Klauser said during a recent interview with Jalopnik. She and her family grew up on a large piece of property in Maryland where she learned to love being around big machinery and began to understand the value of a car since it was the only way she could access things like grocery stores. There cars were a necessity.

She initially wanted to be a mechanic but her family wanted her to pursue a college education. She opted for mechanical engineering instead which fed right into her love of numbers and it was at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute that Klauser discovered Formula SAE and by proxy motorsport.

“I chose RPI for a couple reasons but one of them was actually you didn’t have to come in with loads of experience to be on the Formula SAE team” she said. “They were willing to take whoever was willing to put the work in and as soon as I got on campus freshman year I got right involved with it.

“In fact I remember a funny story. My parents came to visit me October of freshman year... and I had been at the race car shop. I had been working on the car and I’m just chattering away about how much fun I’m having. And they’re just looking at me. And finally they sat me down. They’re like are you having fun here? They’re like what about parties? Are you going to parties? You can tell us we don’t care. No race car mom and dad I’m at the shop building a race car! And they were all just like really?”

Soon after graduation Klauser achieved her childhood goal: she joined GM in a variety of production car roles that Klauser credits with helping her excel today. She started out working on the C7 Corvette before dipping into the Cadillac CT6 world. After that it was to the Sonic and the Spark.

During that time Klauser worked a variety of different roles. She was a design release engineer on the suspension side of things so she was well attuned to what it took to make a car comfortable and fast. She worked vehicle definition and balance where she says she took soft phrases like “fun” or “fast” and transformed them into identifiable metrics like 0-60 speed or the ability to handle a certain number of g forces.

“There were little things you could pull from each job that really had to do with working with balancing projects balancing expectations and then creating a network within GM that has helped me connect back to production as much as possible with the racing programs” Klauser told me of her time in production.

Crucially though she had a chance to get to know the mechanics and engineers who were building the production cars that would actually become race cars. Some of those engineers moved from the production car world to racing so when Klauser took on her role as Sports Car Racing Program Manager she had a network of people she already knew and who already respected her abilities.

Laughing Klauser also confessed that racing is enjoyable for something else: its relative simplicity.

“Production cars are in my opinion more challenging than race cars” she said. “Race cars we are pushing to the limit. But a production car needs to start at 120 [degrees Fahrenheit]. It needs to start a negative 20. It needs to meet all the government regulations. You’re handing it to anybody to drive whereas a race car has skill. There’s all these things that make production ridiculously challenging. Plus you have to meet your cost targets and all this stuff. The plant has to be able to build it. It’s a lot.”

It was almost a relief when she moved into racing in 2016 where she was in charge of the program running the Cadillac ATS-V.R in Pirelli World Challenge. There she was not only able to focus on going fast and winning races but she also began to forge relationships with mechanics and team members that would benefit her when she moved up the ranks.

Klauser moved into her new role in a time of flux. Not only was the COVID-19 pandemic raging in full force but she also took over from longtime Corvette Racing custodian Doug Fehan and immediately launched into the development of an LMDh to compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

“I don’t think it was probably too much of a surprise to the team when I came on board just because of the amount we’ve been working together” she said. “Plus we’ve been trying for the past couple years to make sure that whenever GM spoke whether that was through Corvette Cadillac or Camaro with the sanctioning body that we were consistently communicating because at the end of the day we are one company. So we wanted to make sure that we were portraying ourselves as such. And that meant that all of us had to get together and really operate one because we were trying to figure out our goals and all of those things.”

The hardest part Klauser admitted has been the fan interactions — or the lack thereof.

“When I started fans weren’t allowed in the paddock. We weren’t allowed in the corrals. We weren’t able to do any of that interacting. And I think it really left the door open for a lot of people to be confused as to what was happening and feeling like they didn’t have that touch point that they could come and talk to somebody. The good news is now we are able to interact with our fans more often. And I think that’s definitely helped allow them the opportunity to see that we’re still racing. We still want to win. The goals are all the same. We want to put on the best show that we can; we want people to be excited about the cars.”

Since then she’s found her transition into her various roles to be successful. As Sports Car Racing Program Manager Klauser and her assistant program manager Christie Bagne are the main points of contact between the teams the sanctioning body and their technical partners. So while they’re not the ones doing hands-on machining they’re the ones coordinating everyone within the team’s budget and making sure everything on the car corresponds to the series specs.

At the track Klauser is staying on top of the function of the team by checking in with everyone on the team to see if they need anything chatting with fans staying on top of balance of power changes and advising on strategies.

“I’ve always been good at the project management side” Klauser said when I asked what makes her such a good fit for her role. “I loved budgeting since I was little and figuring out how to be creative within constraints because you only have so much money to play with.

“But I think the thing that I’d like to think is my biggest strength is I really like working with people and I love it when I can bring two different groups of people or two different people together because they both want to do something similar and they just need it to meet each other and they need it to start to figure out how to connect and then magic starts to happen.

“I’m good at removing roadblocks. I’m good at listening understanding what people’s needs are and then pulling them together so that we can have ultimately all the goals are met because at the end of the day you’ll find especially racing’s easy because everyone has the same goal they want to win. We’re all going the same direction. It’s just that we all have different ideas maybe on a how to get there or maybe we don’t have all the information that we need. And really it’s making sure that we all kind of start moving together and showing how much stronger we are when we work as a group.”

Motorsport remains a male-dominated sphere even well into 2021 but Klauser has never been intimidated thanks to the female role models in her family.

“My grandmother she was the very first woman in the neighborhood that she lived in to wear pants” Klauser said. “She could do anything. She taught herself to drive. My grandfather after the Navy took a job on ships moving them back and forth across the Atlantic and she was at home with two kids running a farm. And then she was very loving and definitely she honored ‘respect thy neighbor.’

“My mom was a homemaker but she was the toughest person I still know to this day and a cancer survivor. Pushing to make sure that the household always had what we needed. All those things. And no shame to my father my grandfather. They were big parts of growing up too. My dad was an electrician. I thought that was neat. He could do everything. He did plumbing; he built a couple houses all that stuff. Really the ability to have that independence to do that stuff for yourself was neat. But it was great to have strong women to look up to in the family.”

She’s kept her family in mind as she’s led her teams to victory at the Rolex 24 in Daytona. Now Klauser is moving onto her next challenge: helping build an LMDh prototype capable of winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMS8xMC9yZWZyZXNoZWQtMjAyMi1zaWx2ZXJhZG8tZW5naW5lLWxpbmV1cC1jb21wbGV0ZS1kZXRhaWxzL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMS8xMC9yZWZyZXNoZWQtMjAyMi1zaWx2ZXJhZG8tZW5naW5lLWxpbmV1cC1jb21wbGV0ZS1kZXRhaWxzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Refreshed 2022 Silverado Engine Lineup: Complete Details,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/10/refreshed-2022-silverado-engine-lineup-complete-details/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMS8xMC9yZWZyZXNoZWQtMjAyMi1zaWx2ZXJhZG8tZW5naW5lLWxpbmV1cC1jb21wbGV0ZS1kZXRhaWxzL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMS8xMC9yZWZyZXNoZWQtMjAyMi1zaWx2ZXJhZG8tZW5naW5lLWxpbmV1cC1jb21wbGV0ZS1kZXRhaWxzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Life sciences company Schrödinger (SDGR -1.77%) has developed software that could help drug companies develop medicine using artificial intelligence and physics and it's already being used by a number of big-name pharma companies.

In this video from ""Beat & Raise"" on Motley Fool Live recorded on Sept. 23 tech healthcare and cannabis editor and analyst Olivia Zitkus and Fool.com contributor Brian Withers take a look at Schrödinger's technology recent earnings results and what makes it a stock to watch.

10 stocks we like better than Schrödinger Inc.

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.* They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Schrödinger Inc. wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of September 17 2021

Olivia Zitkus: Sure. I will take this home with Schrödinger before we hop over to some questions from Slido. This is a very complicated stock to end on so I'm going to do my best to explain what in the world it does. Schrödinger is a pharma software company and more. It basically runs computer simulations that work on AI-driven molecular design. Its platform is all AI and physics-based. It runs various chemical simulations to help companies find basically medicinal combinations that have higher probabilities of success. It's also developing its own medications off of this platform.

Their main idea is basically if you can compute all relevant molecular properties with high accuracy with the computer designing drugs and materials so not even just inside the pharma space but materials too would have a higher success rate be faster and they'd be cheaper. It's named Schrödinger after the Schrödinger's cat theory from physics which took me back to high school and yeah it applies to this stock because they're trying to observe how many possible outcomes that nature could fall to that could help produce a positive outcome. Go Google Schrödinger's cat we don't have time for that. That's a whole other rabbit hole.

But it's a very interesting company. Its priorities now it only IPO'd I think in February 2020 its priorities right now are investments to advance its own drug discovery pipeline using this AI- and physics-driven model and to drive the adoption of its software among other pharma businesses. I should mention it was actually founded in 1990 only went public in 2020. As investors in situations like this I want to look at several metrics and qualitative areas in both software. That's the first phase and the drug development spaces. R&D spending cash on-hand strength of the pipeline itself what actual drugs are they working on collaboration agreements annual contract value so you've got this awesome mix of both the software issues that we're used to looking at for SaaS companies and then also these healthcare and drug pipeline issues that I'm used to looking at for biotech.

Just quickly revenue in their second quarter that was released on Aug. 12 was up 23% year over year. It came in at $32 million and software revenue comprised $26.3 million of that and that segment grew 11% year over year. The business has a good bit of cash on hand. It has about $650 million in cash but that was as of March 31. A couple of its partners that have signed on to develop drugs with its platform they're pretty big. Bristol Myers Squibb Zai Lab Takeda Pharmaceuticals is one as well. Their software annual contract value was up 22% from 2019 to 2020 to about $91 million their annual contract value and customer retention for high-spending groups over $1 million in annual contract value. The compound annual growth rate for that group is 27%. The high spenders are spending a lot more so far year over year which is great news. Then for the customers who are paying just above $100000 a year their compound annual growth rate I think it's more around 13.

So far this year the stock is down about 25% year to date. They are expecting I think total revenues of about $130 million at the midpoint which would represent about 25$increase year over year. It's still a mid-cap company so there are going to be bigger swings on good and bad news like a lot of the companies we've talked about [laughs] over this past hour. But I think for Schrödinger it's the tech that's changing the game and the drug development is there as proof of that technological concept and as proof of that AI- and physics-driven concept. They sound like they're excited about recurring revenue they're high top-line visibility from their software sales that's what's going to drive growth through them. They've acknowledged that the drug discovery revenue is a little bit less predictable than the software revenue based on the timing of collaborative agreements and milestones as it relate to the development process. Their operations their expenses aren't done growing either. But if the concept works which it looks like it does we can discover new compounds in a fraction of the time it normally takes us and then a fraction of the cost. We can only imagine tapping into the drug discovery space for a lot less money and what a difference that would make. That's Schrödinger that might be the most complicated stock of the day. [laughs]

Brian Withers: Yeah that's a super interesting company. I love the use of software to help with shortening the drug discovery timeline. I'm surprised at some of the big pharma companies didn't invent a homegrown solution on their own here. Are these guys an independent neutral party for the industry and a first-mover?

Zitkus: Yeah that's a really good question. They are neutral party. They partnered with a lot of different big named pharma companies that you would think if there were a pharma company to move on something like this they would've done it. Gilead Takeda. I think Sanofi I believe Taylor might know as well. Sanofi I never say that one correctly. Those are big companies that didn't bring the effort under their own roof and decided to partner with Schrödinger to get it done instead. In 2016 Gilead bought a specialized system just for one treatment development of drugs for one indication rather for $1.2 billion and that was in 2016. You've either got these companies coming in and buying a very specific software that's tailored to that company's drug developing specialty or you've got partnerships like they have now with Bristol Myers Squibb when they're working in tandem to develop the software iterate together and do that thing instead they're paying for the computing services in the development process. I think it's a neutral party and definitely has its early mover advantage. I'm not totally sure if it's the first to attempt this type of work but like I said they've been around since 1990 and they rolled out their first predictor system in 2001. That's a long time definitely early mover advantage if not first.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwLzAyL3dvcmxkL3NjaWVuY2UtaGVhbHRoLXdvcmxkL21lcmNrLWNvcm9uYXZpcnVzLXRyZWF0bWVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck pill seen as 'huge advance' raises hope of preventing COVID-19 deaths,"An experimental antiviral pill developed by Merck & Co. could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalized for those most at risk of contracting severe COVID-19 according to data that experts hailed as a potential breakthrough in how the virus is treated.

The secret documents expose offshore dealings of the King of Jordan the presidents of Ukraine Kenya and Ecuador the prime minister of the Czech Republic and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The files also detail financial activities of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “unofficial minister of propaganda” and more than 130 billionaires from Russia the United States Turkey and other nations.

The leaked records reveal that many of the power players who could help bring an end to the offshore system instead benefit from it – stashing assets in covert companies and trusts while their governments do little to slow a global stream of illicit money that enriches criminals and impoverishes nations.

Among the hidden treasures revealed in the documents:

A $22 million chateau in the French Riviera – replete with a cinema and two swimming pools – purchased through offshore companies by the Czech Republic’s populist prime minister a billionaire who has railed against the corruption of economic and political elites.

More than $13 million tucked in a secrecy-shaded trust in the Great Plains of the United States by a scion of one of Guatemala’s most powerful families a dynasty that controls a soap and lipsticks conglomerate that’s been accused of harming workers and the earth.

Three beachfront mansions in Malibu purchased through three offshore companies for $68 million by the King of Jordan in the years after Jordanians filled the streets during Arab Spring to protest joblessness and corruption.

The secret records are known as the Pandora Papers.

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists obtained the trove of more than 11.9 million confidential files and led a team of more than 600 journalists from 150 news outlets that spent two years sifting through them tracking down hard-to-find sources and digging into court records and other public documents from dozens of countries.

The leaked records come from 14 offshore services firms from around the world that set up shell companies and other offshore nooks for clients often seeking to keep their financial activities in the shadows. The records include information about the dealings of nearly three times as many current and former country leaders as any previous leak of documents from offshore havens.

In an era of widening authoritarianism and inequality the Pandora Papers investigation provides an unequaled perspective on how money and power operate in the 21st century – and how the rule of law has been bent and broken around the world by a system of financial secrecy enabled by the U.S. and other wealthy nations.

The findings by ICIJ and its media partners spotlight how deeply secretive finance has infiltrated global politics – and offer insights into why governments and global organizations have made little headway in ending offshore financial abuses.

An ICIJ analysis of the secret documents identified 956 companies in offshore havens tied to 336 high-level politicians and public officials including country leaders cabinet ministers ambassadors and others. More than two-thirds of those companies were set up in the British Virgin Islands a jurisdiction long known as a key cog in the offshore system.

At least $11.3 trillion is held “offshore” according to a 2020 study by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Because of the complexity and secrecy of the offshore system it’s not possible to know how much of that wealth is tied to tax evasion and other crimes and how much of it involves funds that come from legitimate sources and have been reported to proper authorities.

The Pandora Papers investigation unmasks the covert owners of offshore companies incognito bank accounts private jets yachts mansions even artworks by Picasso Banksy and other masters – providing more information than what’s usually available to law enforcement agencies and cash-strapped governments.

People linked by the secret documents to offshore assets include India’s cricket superstar Sachin Tendulkar pop music diva Shakira supermodel Claudia Schiffer and an Italian mobster known as “Lell the Fat One.”

The mobster Raffaele Amato has been tied to at least a dozen killings. The documents provide details about a shell company registered in the United Kingdom that Amato used to buy land in Spain shortly before fleeing there from Italy to set up his own crime gang. Amato whose history helped inspire the highly praised movie “Gomorrah” is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

Amato’s attorney did not respond to ICIJ’s request for comment.

Tendulkar’s attorney said the cricket player’s investment is legitimate and has been declared to tax authorities. Shakira’s attorney said the singer declared her companies which the attorney said do not provide tax advantages. Schiffer’s representatives said the supermodel correctly pays her taxes in the U.K. where she lives.

In most countries it’s not illegal to have assets offshore or to use shell companies to do business across national borders. Businesspeople who operate internationally say they need offshore companies to conduct their financial affairs.

But these affairs often amount to shifting profits from high-tax countries where they are earned to companies that exist only on paper in low-tax jurisdictions. Using offshore shelters is especially controversial for political figures because they can be used to keep politically unpopular or even illicit activities from public view.

In popular imagination the offshore system is often seen as a far-flung cluster of palm-shaded islands. The Pandora Papers show that the offshore money machine operates in every corner of the planet including the world’s largest democracies. The key players in the system include elite institutions – multinational banks law firms and accounting practices – headquartered in the U.S. and Europe.

A document in the Pandora Papers shows that banks around the world helped their customers set up at least 3926 offshore companies with the assistance of Alemán Cordero Galindo & Lee a Panamanian law firm led by a former ambassador to the U.S. The document shows that the firm – also known as Alcogal – set up at least 312 companies in the British Virgin Islands for clients of the American financial services giant Morgan Stanley.

A Morgan Stanley spokesperson said: “We do not create offshore companies. . . . This process is independent of the firm and at the discretion and direction of the client.”

The Pandora Papers investigation also highlights how Baker McKenzie the largest law firm in the U.S. helped create the modern offshore system and continues to be a mainstay of this shadow economy.

Baker McKenzie and its global affiliates have used their lobbying and legislation-drafting know-how to shape financial laws around the world. They have also profited from work done for people tied to fraud and corruption reporting by ICIJ has found.

The people that the firm has done work for includes Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky who U.S. authorities allege laundered $5.5 billion through a tangle of shell companies purchasing factories and commercial properties across the U.S. heartland.

Baker McKenzie also did work for Jho Low a now-fugitive financier accused by authorities in multiple countries of masterminding the embezzlement of more than $4.5 billion from a Malaysian economic development fund known as 1MDB. ICIJ’s reporting found that Low relied on Baker McKenzie and its affiliates to help him and his associates build a web of companies in Malaysia and Hong Kong. U.S. authorities allege they used some of those companies to shift money looted from 1MDB.

A spokesperson for Baker McKenzie said the firm seeks to provide the best advice to its clients and strives “to ensure that our clients adhere to both the law and best practice.”

The spokesperson didn’t directly address many questions about Baker McKenzie’s role in the offshore economy citing client confidentiality and legal privilege. But he said the firm performs strict background checks on all potential clients.

‘You know who’

The Pandora Papers investigation is larger and more global than even ICIJ’s landmark Panama Papers investigation which rocked the world in 2016 spawning police raids and new laws in dozens of countries and the fall of prime ministers in Iceland and Pakistan.

The Panama Papers came from the files of a single offshore services provider: the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. The Pandora Papers shine a light on a far wider cross-section of the lawyers and middlemen who are at the heart of the offshore industry.

The Pandora Papers provide more than twice as much information about the ownership of offshore companies. In all the new leak of documents reveals the real owners of more than 29000 offshore companies. The owners come from more than 200 countries and territories with the largest contingents from Russia the U.K. Argentina and China.

The 150 news outlets that joined the investigative partnership include The Washington Post the BBC The Guardian Radio France Oštro Croatia the Indian Express Zimbabwe’s The Standard Morocco’s Le Desk and Ecuador’s Diario El Universo.

A global team was needed because the 14 offshore providers that are the sources of the leaked documents are headquartered around the globe from the Caribbean to the Persian Gulf to the South China Sea.

Three of the providers are owned by former senior government officials: a former government minister and presidential adviser in Panama and a former attorney general of Belize who controls two providers.

For a few hundred or a few thousand dollars offshore providers can help clients set up a company whose real owners remain hidden. Or for perhaps $2000 to $25000 they can set up a trust that in some instances allows its beneficiaries to control their money while embracing the legal fiction that they don’t control it – a bit of paper-shuffling creativity that helps shield assets from creditors law enforcement and ex-spouses.

Offshore operatives don’t work in isolation. They partner with other secrecy providers around the globe to create interlocking layers of companies and trusts. The more complex the arrangements the higher the fees – and the more secrecy and protection clients can expect.

The Pandora Papers show that an English accountant in Switzerland worked with lawyers in the British Virgin Islands to help Jordan’s monarch King Abdullah II secretly purchase 14 luxury homes worth more than $106 million in the U.S. and the U.K. The advisers helped him set up at least 36 shell companies from 1995 to 2017.

In 2017 the king bought a $23 million property overlooking a California surfing beach through a company in the BVI. The king paid extra to have another BVI company owned by his Swiss wealth managers act as the “nominee” director for the BVI company that bought the property.

In the offshore world nominee directors are people or companies paid to front for whoever is really behind a company. Application forms sent to clients by Alcogal the law firm working on the king’s behalf say that the use of nominee directors helps “preserve privacy by avoiding the identity of the ultimate principal . . . being publicly accessible.”

In emails offshore advisers used a code name for the king: “You know who.”

U.K. attorneys for the king said that he is not required to pay taxes under Jordanian law and that he has security and privacy reasons to hold property through offshore companies. They said the king has never misused public funds.

The attorneys also said that most of the companies and properties identified by ICIJ have no connection to the king or no longer exist but declined to provide details.

Experts say that as ruler of one of the Middle East’s poorest and most aid-dependent countries the king has reasons to avoid flaunting his wealth.

“If the Jordanian monarch were to display his wealth more publicly it wouldn’t only antagonize his people it would piss off Western donors who have given him money” Annelle Sheline an expert on political authority in the Middle East told ICIJ.

In neighboring Lebanon where similar questions about wealth and poverty have been playing out the Pandora Papers show top political and financial figures have also embraced offshore havens.

They include the current prime minister Najib Mikati and his predecessor Hassan Diab as well as Riad Salameh the governor of Lebanon’s central bank who is under investigation in France for alleged money laundering.

Marwan Kheireddine Lebanon’s former minister of state and the chairman of Al Mawarid Bank also appears in the secret files. In 2019 he scolded former parliamentary colleagues for inaction amid a dire economic crisis. Half the population was living in poverty struggling to find food as grocers and bakeries closed.

“There is tax evasion and the government needs to address that” Kheireddine said.

That same year the Pandora Papers reveal Kheireddine signed documents as owner of a BVI company that owns a $2 million yacht.

Al Mawarid Bank was one of many in the country that restricted customers’ U.S. dollar withdrawals to stem economic panic.

Wafaa Abou Hamdan a 57-year-old widow is among the regular Lebanese who remain angry at their country’s elites. Because of runaway inflation her life savings plummeted from the equivalent of $60000 to less than $5000 she told Daraj an ICIJ media partner.

“All my life’s efforts went in vain. I have been working continuously for the past three decades” she said. “We are still struggling on a daily basis to maintain our living” while “the politicians and the bankers” have “all transferred and invested their money abroad.”

Kheireddine and Diab did not respond to requests for comment. In a written response Salameh said he declares his assets and has complied with reporting obligations under Lebanese law. Mikati’s son Maher said it is common for people in Lebanon to use offshore companies “due to the easy process of incorporation” rather than a desire to evade taxes.

‘Coalition of the corrupt’

Imran Khan was elated when ICIJ’s Panama Papers investigation came out in April 2016.

“The leaks are God-sent” the Pakistani politician and former cricket superstar said.

The Panama Papers revealed that the children of Pakistan’s prime minister at the time Nawaz Sharif had ties to offshore companies. This gave Khan an opening to hammer Sharif his political rival on what Khan described as the “coalition of the corrupt” ravaging Pakistan.

“It is disgusting the way money is plundered in the developing world from people who are already deprived of basic amenities: health education justice and employment” Khan told ICIJ’s partner The Guardian in 2016. “This money is put into offshore accounts or even western countries western banks. The poor get poorer. Poor countries get poorer and rich countries get richer. Offshore accounts protect these crooks.”

Ultimately Pakistan’s top court removed Sharif from office as a result of an inquiry sparked by the Panama Papers. Khan swept in to replace him in the next national election.

ICIJ’s latest investigation the Pandora Papers brings renewed attention to the use of offshore companies by Pakistani political players. This time the offshore holdings of people close to Khan are being disclosed including his finance minister and a top financial backer.

The documents also show that Khan’s water resources minister Chaudhry Moonis Elahi contacted Asiaciti an Singapore-based offshore services provider in 2016 about setting up a trust to invest the profits from a family land deal that had been financed by what the lender later claimed was an illegal loan. The bank told Pakistani authorities that the loan had been approved due to the influence of Elahi’s father a former deputy prime minister.

Asiaciti records say that Elahi backed off from putting money into a trust in Singapore after the provider told him it would report the details to Pakistani tax authorities.

Elahi did not respond to ICIJ’s requests for comment. Hours before the release of Pandora Papers stories a family spokesman told ICIJ media partners that “misleading interpretations and data have been circulated in files for nefarious reasons.” The spokesman added that the family’s assets “are declared as per applicable law.”

Also today a spokesperson for Khan told a press conference that if any of his ministers or advisors had offshore companies “they will have to be held accountable.”

Other political figures have also spoken out against the offshore system while surrounded by appointees and other supporters who have assets stowed offshore. Some who have spoken out have used the system themselves.

“Every public servant’s assets must be declared publicly so that people can question and ask – what is legitimate?” Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta told the BBC in 2018. “If you can’t explain yourself including myself then I have a case to answer.”

The leaked records listed Kenyatta and his mother as beneficiaries of a secretive foundation in Panama. Other family members including his brother and two sisters own five offshore companies with assets worth more than $30 million the records show.

Kenyatta and his family did not reply to requests for comment.

Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis one of his country’s richest men rose to power promising to crack down on tax evasion and corruption. In 2011 as he became more involved in politics Babis told voters that he wanted to create a country “where entrepreneurs will do business and will be happy to pay taxes.”

The leaked records show that in 2009 Babis injected $22 million into a string of shell companies to buy a sprawling property known as Chateau Bigaud in a hilltop village in Mougins France near Cannes.

Babis has not disclosed the shell companies and the chateau in the asset declarations he’s required to file as a public official according to documents obtained by ICIJ’s Czech partner Investigace.cz. In 2018 a real estate conglomerate indirectly owned by Babis quietly bought the Monaco company that owned the chateau.

Babis didn’t respond to requests for comment.

A spokesman for the conglomerate told ICIJ that it complies with the law. He didn’t respond to questions about the acquisition of the chateau.

“Like any other business entity we have the right to protect our trade secrets” the spokesman wrote.

‘A haven of scams’

The secret files provide a layer of behind-the-curtain context to public pronouncements this year about wealth and offshore refuges — as governments around the world struggle with revenue crunches a pandemic climate change and public distrust.

In February a commentary from the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change urged policymakers to seek among other measures higher taxes on land and homes. Blair the institute’s founder and executive chairman talked about how the rich and well-connected shirk paying their share of taxes as far back as 1994 when he campaigned to become the leader of the U.K.’s Labour Party.

“For those who can employ the right accountants the tax system is a haven of scams perks … and profits” he said during a speech in England’s West Midlands. “We should not make our tax rules a playground for …. tax abusers who pay little or nothing while others pay more than their share.”

The Pandora Papers show that in 2017 Blair and his wife Cherie became the owners of a $8.8 million Victorian building by acquiring the British Virgin Islands company that held the property. The London building now hosts Cherie Blair’s law firm.

The records indicate that Cherie Blair and her husband who served as a diplomat in the Middle East after stepping down as prime minister in 2007 bought the offshore company that owned the building from the family of Bahrain’s industry and tourism minister Zayed bin Rashid al-Zayani.

By purchasing the company shares instead of the building the Blairs benefited from a legal arrangement that saved them from having to pay more than $400000 in property taxes.

The Blairs and the al-Zayanis said they didn’t initially know about each other’s involvement in the deal.

Cherie Blair said that her husband was not involved in the transaction and that its purpose was “bringing the company and the building back into the U.K. tax and regulatory regime.”

She also said that she “did not want to be the owner of a BVI company” and that the “seller for their own purposes only wanted to sell the company.” The company is now closed.

Through their lawyer the al-Zayanis said their companies “have complied with all U.K. laws past and present.”

“These are loopholes that are available to wealthy people but not available to others” Robert Palmer executive director of Tax Justice UK told The Guardian. “Politicians need to fix the tax system so that everyone pays their fair share.”

In June Brazil’s economics minister Paulo Guedes proposed a tax reform package that included a 30% tax on profits earned through offshore entities. Experts estimate that Brazil’s richest people hold almost $200 billion in untaxed funds outside the country.

“You cannot be ashamed of being rich” Guedes said. “You have to be ashamed of not paying taxes.”

After bankers and business leaders objected to tax hikes in the legislation Guedes a millionaire former banker agreed to remove the proposed tax on offshore profits. Negotiations over the legislation are continuing.

The Pandora Papers reveal that Guedes created Dreadnoughts International Group in 2014 in the British Virgin Islands.

In response to questions from an ICIJ partner in Brazil Revista Piauí a spokesperson for Guedes said the minister has disclosed the company to Brazilian authorities. The spokesperson did not answer a question about the removal of the offshore tax from the legislation.

‘Pandora’s box’

In December 2018 the Bahamas enacted legislation requiring companies and certain trusts to declare their real owners to a government registry. The island nation was under pressure from larger countries including the U.S. to do more to block tax dodgers and criminals from the financial system.

Some Bahamian politicians opposed the move. They complained the register would discourage Latin American clients from doing business in the Caribbean. “The winners of these new double standards are the U.S. states of Delaware Alaska and South Dakota” one local attorney said.

Months later a confidential document indicated that the family of the Dominican Republic’s former Vice President Carlos Morales Troncoso had abandoned the Bahamas as a go-to sanctuary for their wealth.

For their new refuge they chose a place 1600 miles away: Sioux Falls South Dakota.

The family set up South Dakota trusts leaked records show to lay away various assets including shares they’d held in a Dominican sugar company. The family did not respond to questions about the assets moved from the Bahamas to South Dakota.

The Pandora Papers provide details about tens of millions of dollars moved from offshore havens in the Caribbean and Europe into South Dakota a sparsely populated American state that has become a major destination for foreign assets.

Over the past decade South Dakota Nevada and more than a dozen other U.S. states have transformed themselves into leaders in the business of peddling financial secrecy. Meanwhile most of the policy and law enforcement efforts of the world’s most powerful nations have stayed focused on “traditional” offshore havens such as the Bahamas the Caymans and other island paradises.

The U.S. is one of the biggest players in the offshore world. It is also the country best situated to bring an end to offshore financial abuses thanks to the outsize role it plays in the international banking system. Because of the U.S. dollar’s status as the de facto global currency most international transactions flow in and out of New York-based banking operations.

U.S. authorities have taken action over the past two decades to force banks in Switzerland and other countries to turn over information about Americans with overseas accounts.

But the U.S. is more interested in forcing other countries to share information about Americans banking offshore than in sharing information about money moving through U.S. bank accounts companies and trusts.

The U.S. has refused to join a 2014 agreement supported by more than 100 jurisdictions including the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg that would require American financial institutions to share information they have about foreigners’ assets.

Year after year in South Dakota state lawmakers have approved legislation drafted by trust industry insiders providing more and more protections and other benefits for trust customers in the U.S. and abroad. Customer assets in South Dakota trusts have more than quadrupled over the past decade to $360 billion.

“As a citizen I’m so sad that my state was the state that opened Pandora’s box” Susan Wismer a former lawmaker told ICIJ.

By 2020 17 of the world’s 20 least-restrictive jurisdictions for trusts were American states according to a study by Israeli academic Adam Hofri-Winogradow. In many cases he said U.S. laws have made it more difficult for creditors to put their hands on what they are owed including child support payments from absent parents.

Using documents from the Pandora Papers ICIJ and The Washington Post identified nearly 30 U.S.-based trusts linked to foreigners personally accused of misconduct or whose companies were accused of wrongdoing.

Among them is Federico Kong Vielman whose family is one of Guatemala’s economic powerhouses.

In 2016 Kong Vielman moved $13.5 million into a trust in Sioux Falls. Some of the money came from his family’s company which makes floor waxes and other products.

Guatemalan media reported for decades on the family’s ties to politics. In the 1970s the family was identified as a key ally of Gen. Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio the former Guatemalan dictator known as the “Jackal of Zacapa.” In 2016 the family’s luxury hotel in Guatemala City made a gift of 100 free nights to then-President Jimmy Morales. Guatemalan media outlets reported that a possible payment for “political favors” was suspected.

In 2014 U.S. labor officials filed a complaint against Guatemala’s government that included allegations that the family’s palm oil company underpaid workers and exposed them to toxic chemicals. Company records show Kong Vielman was previously the company’s treasurer.

A year later U.S. environmental authorities providing technical assistance to Guatemala found that the company released pollutants into the Pasion River. The family company Nacional Agro Industrial SA known as Naisa was not charged.

Naisa told ICIJ that it followed the law and did not pollute the river. The labor complaint was resolved by an arbitration panel the company said.

Kong Vielman declined to respond to questions about the South Dakota trust.

Another wealthy Latin American who set up trusts in South Dakota is Guillermo Lasso a banker who was elected as Ecuador’s president in April. Leaked records show that Lasso moved assets into two trusts in South Dakota in December 2017 three months after Ecuador’s parliament passed a law prohibiting public officials from holding assets in tax havens. The records show that Lasso moved two offshore companies to the South Dakota trusts from two secretive foundations in Panama.

Lasso said that his past use of offshore entities was “legal and legitimate.” Lasso said he complies with Ecuadorian law.

Trusts set up in South Dakota and many other U.S. states remain cloaked in secrecy despite enactment this year of the federal Corporate Transparency Act which makes it harder for owners of certain types of companies to hide their identities.

The law is not expected to apply to trusts popular with non-U.S. citizens. Another glaring exemption financial crime experts say is that many lawyers who set up trusts and shell companies have no obligations to examine the sources of their clients’ wealth.

“Clearly the U.S. is a big big loophole in the world” said Yehuda Shaffer former head of the Israeli financial intelligence unit. “The U.S. is criticizing all the rest of the world but in their own backyard this is a very very serious issue.”

‘Extraordinary expenses’

Billionaire Erman Ilicak’s construction empire had a big year in 2014.

The Turkish mogul’s company Rönesans Holding finished building a 1150-room presidential palace for his country’s pugnacious leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan amid media rumblings about cost overruns and corruption and a court order attempting to stop the project.

Another notable event involving the Ilicak family took place in 2014 this time out of the public glare. The corporate titan’s 74-year-old mother Ayse Ilicak became the owner of two offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands according to the Pandora Papers.

Both companies were fronted by nominee directors and nominee shareholders. One of the companies Covar Trading Ltd. held assets from the family’s construction conglomerate the records say. During its first full year in operation Covar Trading earned $105.5 million in income from dividends according to confidential financial statements. The money was stashed in a Swiss account.

It didn’t stay long.

That same year the statements show the company paid almost the entire $105.5 million as a “donation” listed under “extraordinary expenses.” The statements do not describe who or what received the money.

Illiack did not reply to questions for this story.

Ilicak and the other billionaires in the Pandora Papers come from 45 countries with the largest number from Russia (52) Brazil (15) the U.K. (13) and Israel (10).

The American billionaires mentioned in the secret documents include two tech moguls Robert F. Smith and Robert T. Brockman whose trusts have been the targets of investigations by U.S. authorities. Both were clients of CILTrust an offshore provider in Belize operated by Glenn Godfrey a former attorney general of Belize.

Smith agreed last year to pay U.S. authorities $139 million to settle a tax probe and is cooperating with prosecutors. A U.S. grand jury indicted Brockman Smith’s mentor and financial backer in what prosecutors called the biggest tax fraud in U.S. history.

Smith declined to comment. Brockman has pleaded not guilty.

Neither CILTrust nor Godfrey have been accused of wrongdoing. Godfrey did not respond to requests for comment.

A law firm in Cyprus Nicos Chr. Anastasiades and Partners appears in the Pandora Papers as a key offshore go-between for wealthy Russians. The firm retains the name of its founder Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades and the president’s two daughters are partners there.

The records show that in 2015 a compliance manager at the Panama law firm Alcogal found that the Cypriot law firm helped a Russian billionaire and former senator Leonid Lebedev conceal ownership of four companies by listing law firm employees as owners of Lebedev’s entities.

Lebedev – an oil tycoon and movie producer with Hollywood connections – fled Russia in 2016 after authorities accused him of embezzling $220 million from an energy company. Lebedev did not respond to requests for comment. The status of the Russian case is unclear.

The Cypriot law firm also prepared reference letters for Russian steel magnate Alexander Abramov including one drafted days after the U.S. added the billionaire’s name to the list of oligarchs close to President Putin. Abramov didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Theophanis Philippou the law firm’s managing director told the BBC an ICIJ partner that it has never misled authorities or concealed the identity of a company owner. He declined to comment on clients citing attorney-client confidentiality.

Another Russian in the Pandora Papers who has ties to Putin is Konstantin Ernst a television executive and Oscar-nominated producer. He has been called Putin’s top image-maker a creative talent who sold the nation on the idea that the president is “Russia’s strong-willed savior.”

The Pandora Papers reveal that Ernst was given a chance to participate in a lucrative opportunity soon after producing the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics at Sochi creating a spectacle that boosted Putin’s reputation inside and outside the country.

Ernst became a silent partner hidden behind layers of offshore companies in a state-funded privatization contract – a deal to buy dozens of movie theaters and other property from the city of Moscow.

The leaked records show that by 2019 the value of Ernst’s personal stake in the property holdings topped $140 million.

Ernst told ICIJ that he has “never made a secret” of his involvement in the privatization deal and that the deal was not compensation for his work during the 2014 Olympics.

“I haven’t committed any illegal actions” he said. “Nor am I committing any now or about to. This is how my parents raised me.”

‘Our way of life’

As a human rights and anti-poverty activist Mae Buenaventura joined the fight to secure the return of billions of dollars the late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos his family and cronies concealed in Swiss accounts and other hard-to-trace locations.

Many in her home country Buenaventura said “know that the wealthy have ways and means to accumulate riches and also hide them in a way that ordinary people cannot get their hands on.”

The Marcos scandal also educated the world encouraging stepped-up efforts to discover illicit money and punish the people who hide it.

Over the last 20 years political leaders have vowed to “eradicate” tax havens. They’ve called shell companies and money laundering “threats to our security our democracy and our way of life.” They’ve passed new laws and inked international agreements.

But the offshore system is nothing if not adaptable and cross-border financial crime and tax dodging continue to thrive.

When an offshore provider or jurisdiction is exposed by a leak or comes under pressure from authorities others use its misfortune as a marketing opportunity snapping up clients fleeing for safer havens.

An ICIJ analysis identified hundreds of offshore companies that ended relationships with the scandal-tarred law firm Mossack Fonseca after the release of the Panama Papers investigation. Other providers took over as the companies’ offshore agents.

One of those companies was controlled by an offshore trust whose beneficiaries included the wife of Jacob Rees-Mogg a member of the British Conservative Party and current leader of the House of Commons.

The Pandora Papers indicate that a holding company and a trust benefiting his spouse Helena de Chair owned “pictures and paintings” worth $3.5 million.

Another company that moved away from Mossack Fonseca was a BVI entity controlled by the widow and two sons of Indian underworld figure Iqbal Memon. Memon has been identified in news reports as a major drug dealer with links to terrorists. His widow and sons are accused of laundering drug money and have been wanted since 2019 by authorities in New Delhi.

In the Philippines money being moved around in the shadows continues to be a problem despite the attention given to Marcos’ offshore loot. In recent years the U.S. has labeled the Philippines as a “major money laundering jurisdiction.”

Philippine political figures in the Pandora Papers include Juan Andres Donato Bautista. He served from 2010 to 2015 as the chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government – the panel established to track down Marcos’ billions.

A month after he was appointed to lead the commission Bautista created a shell company in the British Virgin Island that held a bank account in Singapore secret records show.

Bautista was later tapped to head the country’s election agency but lawmakers impeached him in 2017 after his wife claimed he’d hoarded millions of dollars in undeclared domestic and foreign accounts.

In a phone call and emails to ICIJ Bautista said he created his BVI company on the advice of bankers. The bank account was opened before he joined the government he said adding that it never received significant deposits and that he disclosed his interests to authorities. He denied wrongdoing and said there are no formal charges against him.

Despite failures by the Philippines and other nations to curb the flow of covert money Buenaventura and other reform advocates say there are reasons for hope.

Street protesters helped topple top leaders in Iceland and Pakistan after the Panama Papers. The Philippines has joined dozens of countries that now require companies to disclose their real owners. Philippine authorities have recovered roughly $4 billion stolen by Marcos and his circle using it to buy land for landless farmers and to compensate families of people targeted for murder or “enforced disappearance” by the Marcos regime.

Many obstacles remain. Big banks law firms and other powerful groups often oppose stronger transparency rules and tougher enforcement against offshore abuses. And in the Philippines and many other countries anti-corruption activists endure legal threats arrests and violence.

Last month police fired water cannons at protesters who marked the 49th anniversary of Marcos’ declaration of martial law by drawing attention to similarities with current President Rodrigo Duterte’s rule.

Buenaventura said she and other grass-roots activists will keep working to expose wealth that’s “deeply hidden.”

“Our slogan is: The truth will come out.”

There are several reasons for this. Most importantly private cryptocurrencies and so-called stablecoins are rapidly becoming popular rivals to traditional money; Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) would not only keep governments in the game but could help make payments and monetary policy more efficient and direct.

CBDCs have the potential to destabilize everything from traditional banking to the power of the U.S. dollar — and authorities are wary of too much disruption to global financial stability. There is a tricky trade-off: The more limits and oversight get built into state-backed cryptocoins the less likely they are to be used.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxL29jdC8wMy9wYW5kb3JhLXBhcGVycy1iaWdnZXN0LWV2ZXItbGVhay1vZi1vZmZzaG9yZS1kYXRhLWV4cG9zZXMtZmluYW5jaWFsLXNlY3JldHMtb2YtcmljaC1hbmQtcG93ZXJmdWzSAY0BaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS9vY3QvMDMvcGFuZG9yYS1wYXBlcnMtYmlnZ2VzdC1ldmVyLWxlYWstb2Ytb2Zmc2hvcmUtZGF0YS1leHBvc2VzLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1zZWNyZXRzLW9mLXJpY2gtYW5kLXBvd2VyZnVs?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pandora papers: biggest ever leak of offshore data exposes financial secrets of rich and powerful,"The secret deals and hidden assets of some of the world’s richest and most powerful people have been revealed in the biggest trove of leaked offshore data in history.

Branded the Pandora papers the cache includes 11.9m files from companies hired by wealthy clients to create offshore structures and trusts in tax havens such as Panama Dubai Monaco Switzerland and the Cayman Islands.

They expose the secret offshore affairs of 35 world leaders including current and former presidents prime ministers and heads of state. They also shine a light on the secret finances of more than 300 other public officials such as government ministers judges mayors and military generals in more than 90 countries.

The files include disclosures about major donors to the Conservative party raising difficult questions for Boris Johnson as his party meets for its annual conference.

More than 100 billionaires feature in the leaked data as well as celebrities rock stars and business leaders. Many use shell companies to hold luxury items such as property and yachts as well as incognito bank accounts. There is even art ranging from looted Cambodian antiquities to paintings by Picasso and murals by Banksy.

The Pandora papers reveal the inner workings of what is a shadow financial world providing a rare window into the hidden operations of a global offshore economy that enables some of the world’s richest people to hide their wealth and in some cases pay little or no tax.

Quick Guide What are the Pandora papers? Show The Pandora papers are the largest trove of leaked data exposing tax haven secrecy in history. They provide a rare window into the hidden world of offshore finance casting light on the financial secrets of some of the world’s richest people. The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) which shared access with the Guardian BBC and other media outlets around the world. In total the trove consists of 11.9m files leaked from a total of 14 offshore service providers totalling 2.94 terabytes of information. That makes it larger in volume than both the Panama papers (2016) and Paradise papers (2017) two previous offshore leaks. Where did the Pandora documents come from? The ICIJ a Washington DC-based journalism nonprofit is not identifying the source of the leaked documents. In order to facilitate a global investigation the ICIJ gave remote access to the documents to journalists in 117 countries including reporters at the Washington Post Le Monde El País Süddeutsche Zeitung PBS Frontline and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In the UK the investigation has been led by the Guardian and BBC Panorama. What is an offshore service provider? The 14 offshore service providers in the leak provide corporate services to individuals or companies seeking to do business offshore. Their clients are typically seeking to discreetly set up companies or trusts in lightly regulated tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands (BVI) Panama the Cook Islands and the US state of South Dakota. Companies registered offshore can be used to hold assets such as property aircraft yachts and investments in stocks and shares. By holding those assets in an offshore company it is possible to hide from the rest of the world the identity of the person they actually belong to or the “beneficial owner”. Why do people move money offshore? Usually for reasons of tax secrecy or regulation. Offshore jurisdictions tend to have no income or corporation taxes which makes them potentially attractive to wealthy individuals and companies who don’t want to pay taxes in their home countries. Although morally questionable this kind of tax avoidance can be legal. Offshore jurisdictions also tend to be highly secretive and publish little or no information about the companies or trusts incorporated there. This can make them useful to criminals such as tax evaders or money launderers who need to hide money from tax or law enforcement authorities. It is also true that people in corrupt or unstable countries may use offshore providers to put their assets beyond the reach of repressive governments or criminal adversaries who may try to seize them or to seek to circumvent hard currency restrictions. Others may go offshore for reasons of inheritance or estate planning. Has everyone named in the Pandora papers done something wrong? No. Moving money offshore is not in or of itself illegal and there are legitimate reasons why some people do it. Not everyone named in the Pandora papers is suspected of wrongdoing. Those who are may stand accused of a wide range of misbehaviour: from the morally questionable through to the potentially criminal. The Guardian is only publishing stories based on leaked documents after considering the public interest. That is a broad concept that may include furthering transparency by revealing the secret offshore owners of UK property even where those owners have done nothing wrong. Other articles might illuminate issues of important public debate raise moral questions shed light on how the offshore industry operates or help inform voters about politicians or donors in the interests of democratic accountability.

There are emails memos incorporation records share certificates compliance reports and complex diagrams showing labyrinthine corporate structures. Often they allow the true owners of opaque shell companies to be identified for the first time.

The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington. It shared access to the leaked data with select media partners including the Guardian BBC Panorama Le Monde and the Washington Post. More than 600 journalists have sifted through the files as part of a massive global investigation.

The Pandora papers represent the latest – and largest in terms of data volume – in a series of major leaks of financial data that have convulsed the offshore world since 2013.

Setting up or benefiting from offshore entities is not itself illegal and in some cases people may have legitimate reasons such as security for doing so. But the secrecy offered by tax havens has at times proven attractive to tax evaders fraudsters and money launderers some of whom are exposed in the files.

Other wealthy individuals and companies stash their assets offshore to avoid paying tax elsewhere a legal activity estimated to cost governments billions in lost revenues.

After more than 18 months analysing the data in the public interest the Guardian and other media outlets will publish their findings over the coming days beginning with revelations about the offshore financial affairs of some of the most powerful political leaders in the world.

They include the ruler of Jordan King Abdullah II who leaked documents reveal has amassed a secret $100m property empire spanning Malibu Washington and London. The king declined to answer specific questions but said there would be nothing improper about him owning properties via offshore companies. Jordan appeared to have blocked the ICIJ website on Sunday hours before the Pandora papers launched.

The files also show that Azerbaijan’s ruling Aliyev family has traded close to £400m of UK property in recent years. One of their properties was sold to the Queen’s crown estate which is now looking into how it came to pay £67m to a company that operated as a front for the family that runs a country routinely accused of corruption. The Aliyevs declined to comment.

The Pandora papers also threaten to cause political upsets for two European Union leaders. The prime minister of the Czech republic Andrej Babiš who is up for election this week is facing questions over why he used an offshore investment company to acquire a $22m chateau in the south of France. He too declined to comment.

And in Cyprus itself a controversial offshore centre the president Nicos Anastasiades may be asked to explain why a law firm he founded was accused of hiding the assets of a controversial Russian billionaire behind fake company owners. The firm denies any wrongdoing while the Cypriot president says he ceased having an active role in its affairs after becoming leader of the opposition in 1997.

Not everyone named in the Pandora papers is accused of wrongdoing. The leaked files reveals that Tony and Cherie Blair saved £312000 in property taxes when they purchased a London building partially owned by the family of a prominent Bahraini minister.

The former prime minister and his wife bought the £6.5m office in Marylebone by acquiring a British Virgin Islands (BVI) offshore company. While the move was not illegal and there is no evidence the Blairs proactively sought to avoid property taxes the deal highlights a loophole that has enabled wealthy property owners not to pay a tax that is commonplace for ordinary Britons.

The leaked records vividly illustrate the central coordinating role London plays in the murky offshore world. The UK capital is home to wealth managers law firms company formation agents and accountants. All exist to serve their ultra-rich clients. Many are foreign-born tycoons who enjoy “non-domicile” status which means they pay no tax on their overseas assets.

View image in fullscreen The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy is also named in the leak. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy who was elected in 2019 on a pledge to clean up his country’s notoriously corrupt and oligarch-influenced economy is also named in the leak. During the campaign Zelenskiy transferred his 25% stake in an offshore company to a close friend who now works as the president’s top adviser the files suggest. Zelenskiy declined to comment and it is unclear if he remains a beneficiary.

The Russian president Vladimir Putin whom the US suspects of having a secret fortune does not appear in the files by name. But numerous close associates do including his best friend from childhood – the late Petr Kolbin – whom critics have called a “wallet” for Putin’s own wealth and a woman the Russian leader was allegedly once romantically involved with. None responded to invitations to comment.

The Pandora papers also place a revealing spotlight on the offshore system itself. In a development likely to prove embarrassing for the US president Joe Biden who has pledged to lead efforts internationally to bring transparency to the global financial system the US emerges from the leak as a leading tax haven. The files suggest the state of South Dakota in particular is sheltering billions of dollars in wealth linked to individuals previously accused of serious financial crimes.

The offshore trail also stretches from Africa to Latin America to Asia and is likely to pose difficult questions for politicians across the world. In Pakistan Moonis Elahi a prominent minister in prime minister Imran Khan’s government contacted an offshore provider in Singapore about investing $33.7m.

In Kenya the president Uhuru Kenyatta has portrayed himself as an enemy of corruption. In 2018 Kenyatta told the BBC: “Every public servant’s assets must be declared publicly so that people can question and ask: what is legitimate?”

He will come under pressure to explain why he and his close relatives amassed more than $30m of offshore wealth including property in London. Kenyatta did not respond to enquiries about whether his family wealth was declared to relevant authorities in Kenya.

The Pandora papers also reveal some of the unseen repercussions of previous offshore leaks which spurred modest reforms in some parts of the world such as the BVI which now keeps a record of the real owners of companies registered there. However the newly leaked data shows money shifting around offshore destinations as wealthy clients and their advisers adjust to new realities.

Some clients of Mossack Fonseca the now defunct law firm at the heart of the 2016 Panama papers disclosures simply transferred their companies to rival providers such as another global trust and corporate administrator with a major office in London whose data is in the new trove of leaked files.

Asked why he was migrating the new company one customer wrote bluntly: “Business decision to exit following the Panama papers.” Another agent said the industry had always “adapted” to external pressure.

2:35 Pandora papers: senior Conservatives dodge questions about donors – video

Some leaked files appear to show some in the industry seeking to circumvent new privacy regulations. One Swiss lawyer refused to email the names of his high-value customers to a service provider in the BVI following new legislation. Instead he sent them by airmail with strict instructions they should not be processed in any “electronic way”. The identity of another beneficial owner was shared via WhatsApp.

“The purpose of this way to proceed is to enable you to comply with BVI rules” the lawyer wrote. Referring to Mossack Fonseca the lawyer added: “You are obliged to keep secrecy for our clients and to not make feasible at all a second ‘Panama papers’ story that happened to one of your competitors.”

Gerard Ryle the director of the ICIJ said leading politicians who organised their finances in tax havens had a stake in the status quo and were likely to be an obstacle to reform of the offshore economy. “When you have world leaders when you have politicians when you have public officials all using the secrecy and all using this world then I don’t think we’re going to see an end to it.”

He expected the Pandora papers to have a greater impact than previous leaks not least because they were arriving in the middle of a pandemic that had exacerbated inequalities and forced governments to borrow unprecedented amounts to be shouldered by ordinary taxpayers. “This is the Panama papers on steroids” Ryle said. “It’s broader richer and has more detail.”

At least $11.3tn in wealth is held offshore according to a 2020 study by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). “This is money that is being lost to treasuries around the world and money that could be used to recover from Covid” Ryle said. “We’re losing out because some people are gaining. It’s as simple as that. It’s a very simple transaction that’s going on here.”

Yu Chang homered for the Indians (80-82) who finished with their first losing season since 2012 before taking the field as the Guardians next season. That ended a streak of eight consecutive winning seasons matching the longest in the history of the franchise that was one of the American League's charter teams in 1901 and became the Indians in 1915.

Four relievers including right-hander Bryan Shaw in his 81st appearance to get into exactly half the games this season followed Civale (12-5) to close out Cleveland's ninth shutout. Shaw extended his franchise record to 459 career relief appearances.

Rangers rookie right-hander Dane Dunning (5-10) allowed four runs and five hits over three innings.

The Rangers were shut out for the 15th time and finished with their most losses since 105 in 1973 the franchise's second season in Texas after moving from Washington. It was their fifth consecutive losing season.

""Civale was really good. It was tough to see"" Rangers manager Chris Woodward said. ""He's really good at mixing up speeds especially with the curveball. After that they threw some really good arms at us. They were clearly hellbent on trying to win that game.""

Civale struck out four and walked one over his 82 pitches after going 1-3 in five September starts. The right-hander led the majors in wins with his 10-2 record before spraining the middle finger on his right hand while pitching against the Chicago Cubs on June 21 and didn't return until last month.

The Indians quickly jumped ahead to stay when Myles Straw led off the game with a single stole second and scored on Amed Rosario's single. It was 6-0 after Chang's ninth homer a two-run shot in the fifth off reliever Mike Foltynewicz who allowed 35 homers in 139 innings pitched this season. The only AL pitcher to give up more long balls was teammate Jordan Lyles at 38 in 180 innings.

CHANGING TO GUARDIANS

Now comes the changing to the Guardians for the Cleveland baseball team that played 107 seasons as the Indians.

""There's a lot of things being saved and treasured in this. … I hope the fans in the city embrace the Guardians as they come in in 2022"" acting manager DeMarlo Hale said.

""There's going to be a lot of keepsakes. Players I saw them collect balls and lineup cards and things like that. It's one for the memory bank for sure.""

""It's an honor for sure"" Civale said. ""What we've always done is always represented the city of Cleveland itself. So that's something we'll continue to do.""

The Indians wore their dark road jerseys with Cleveland across the front and no reference to the name that the team announced earlier this year it was changing in the wake of a nationwide reckoning over racist names and symbols.

Cleveland's new name was selected from over 1000 entries submitted during the renaming process. The new Guardians logo and uniforms were unveiled to mixed reviews in July.

Even before right fielder Bradley Zimmer caught the final out a small group of Indians fans chanted chanting ""Let's Go Tribe!"" Among those there for the Indians' last game were two men sitting right behind home plate after flying in from Las Vegas and Orlando Florida.

SOME QUICK HISTORY

Shoeless Joe Jackson was among the players in the starting lineup for the 1915 season opener when Cleveland played for the first time as the Indians. The franchise's first season was 1901 as the Blues then went by the Broncos in 1902 and the Naps from 1903-14. … Hall of Fame shortstop Lou Boudreau played the most games in an Indians uniform 1560 from 1938-50. There are two players in franchise history who played more games overall but Terry Turner played all but 342 of his 1619 games before 1915. Hall of Famer Nap Lajoie played all 1614 of his games from 1902-14.

On a sunny afternoon with the roof open there was an announced crowd of 28396 at Globe Life Field where the Rangers drew 2110258 fans this season. The NFL's Dallas Cowboys drew a crowd of 93262 for its victory over the Carolina Panthers across the street.

On this date in franchise history the first home of the Texas Rangers saw its final regular season game.

On October 3 1993 the Rangers played their final game at Arlington Stadium losing to the Kansas City Royals 4-1 before a crowd of 41039. The game ended the careers of both Rangers pitcher Nolan Ryan and Royals infielder George Brett both of whom would be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in the same class in 1999.

The Rangers had hoped that Ryan would be able to pitch in that final homestand. But an elbow injury on a road trip to Seattle in September ended his season and his career as Ryan had already announced his retirement after the 1993 season.

Brett and Ryan exchanged the lineup cards for that final game in place the teams’ managers. Brett was the Royals’ designated hitter and went 1-for-4.

The Rangers moved into The Ballpark in Arlington the following season. Arlington Stadium was eventually torn down and became parking for a new stadium. A plaque designating where home plate was at Arlington Stadium is in that parking lot.

The stadium opened as Turnpike Stadium in 1965 and hosted minor league baseball until the Rangers moved from Washington to Arlington for the 1972 season.

Also on this date …

October 3 1999: Rafael Palmeiro played in the Rangers’ final regular season game a 1-0 loss to Anaheim. With the game Palmeiro played his 1526th game of the 1990s the most of any Major League player. Also catcher Iván ‘Pudge’ Rodríguez finished the season with a .332 batting average. In doing so he became the first Rangers player to have five seasons of .300 batting or better.

October 3 2004: With the conclusion of the 2004 season Michael Young finished the season with what was a team record 216 hits.

October 3 2011: The Rangers win Game 3 of the American League Division Series against Tampa Bay as Mike Napoli’s two-run home run and Josh Hamilton’s two-run single fueled the 4-3 victory.

October 3 2012: The Rangers claimed an AL Wild Card berth despite being swept by the Oakland Athletics to end the season.

Open this photo in gallery: Illustration by April Dela Noche Milne

One of my favourite cartoons shows a spouse asking her retired husband what he’s doing today. “Nothing.”

“You did that yesterday” she says and he replies “I haven’t finished yet.”

In retirement I have spent some time researching how to manage things and how to get as comfortable as the man in the cartoon with my new lifestyle. I have had some success and would like to share some advice for those in a similar situation.

If you have a partner at home you have to get used to having a new boss. Chances are your spouse will have a different management style to your former boss in the workplace. To my knowledge there are no training courses to deal with this new regime. Much of your partner’s goal is to stamp out laziness and so I would like to step into this management vacuum to illustrate how I combat this unfair strike against the condition. It is one of the qualities of which I am now most proud. It takes vigilance and effort to feel comfortable – even proud – of having “lazy” thrown at you as an insult.

My wife and I during most of our lives looked down on laziness as a severe character flaw. We were brought up with the good old Victorian ethic of hard work being necessary for salvation; the brainwashing was and is effective.

After I retired it took me some time to get used to not being gainfully employed. I slowly realized that far from laziness being a sin it could be my best friend. Part of the assumption is a lack of motivation. However in my case it is not a lack of motivation but rather a different view of what is important. I know what I want to do – not much in fact – and have begun to use laziness as a shield to avoid what I don’t want. For example while once a social gadfly I have little interest now in social gatherings; this avoidance has been facilitated by COVID-19. Also I rarely answer the phone on the assumption that no friend of mine would call me.

A first tool and friend of laziness is a well-developed skill to “not do things right.” For example I can’t be trusted to do any serious shopping as I’ve been known to forget items and worse pick up the wrong things entirely. In my own interest however I have adjusted how I make the coffee run. I now ask my wife to write down her request these four or five words that make no sense to me when handed to a barista are understood perfectly. This way if the end product is wrong I cannot be blamed.

My wife and I were born in a time and place where women did all the cooking. She long since realized the inequity of this and taught our three sons to cook but she never got around to me. One of the reasons I never learned to cook was not entirely conventional laziness. While I like food I see it as a functional necessity rather than something to be worshipped and I have successfully resisted the temptation to get interested. I am allowed however to manage the dishwasher and clean the pots and pans although I’m told I sometimes don’t clean them properly.

Another enhancement to the laziness strategy is a willingness to execute the “shortcut.” I developed this skill while I was still working. There were many situations where a project was expected to take so many hours; I never felt guilty if I found a way to shave off time using a shortcut. Sometimes the shortcut result was not quite as elegant but I had long since realized the evils of perfectionism. The shortcut is an important asset in the portfolio. There is every chance your new boss will shoot down shortcut work and thus judge you unsuitable for similar tasks.

Also taking initiative outside of instructions has a high chance of being shot down. Taking the initiative when shopping for example has a high chance of being shot down both as “not doing the right thing” and “not doing things right.” This inevitably leads to you being relieved of the task in the future.

I do take care of some chores like taking out the garbage plunging the toilets replacing light bulbs and so on. I have already dispensed with the grass so there is no more cutting in that department. Our last dog was not replaced and so that is another project finished off. It has not escaped my notice that my traditional tasks are fairly menial and have little scope for “not doing the things right” My proviso is that I accept these responsibilities so long as I can do them in my own time and my own way. There is nothing more annoying than to be interrupted in the middle of the important task of reading the newspaper with a request to get some avocados and an expectation that I go to the store immediately.

This summer at short notice I was asked to take the grandchildren swimming. Was I going to go to the bedroom and put on my swimsuit? No too much trouble! I decided I’d use my underpants instead. When my wife decided at the last minute to come along I feared a critique of my sartorial choice. I’d thought the underpants in a patterned blue were a design that could also be interpreted as swimwear. When I came out of the pool however she told me I displayed a nice wedgie my backside was transparent and the Joe Fresh tag on the outside advertised my trunks’s true function to the gathered citizenry. So my point is that you will also need a thick skin when following the chosen path of laziness.

In summary sloth is a high art form that needs constant burnishing. It thrives on “not doing the things right” which in turn is helped by using shortcuts and initiative and is wrapped up with a healthy disdain for perfectionism. I am working to ensure my skills for several activities remain deficient. It is one thing to be perceived as mediocre now and again but sustained mediocrity is an art form and a pinnacle reached by only a few. One of my last steps to combat the anti-laziness movement is to embrace that what other people think about me is none of my business.

GS,Goldman Sachs,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMjcvYnVzaW5lc3MvZGVhbGJvb2svb3p5LWdvbGRtYW4tc2FjaHMtaW52ZXN0bWVudC1jYWxsLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Strange Voice on the Phone,"A meeting gone wrong

“As he spoke however the man’s voice began to sound strange to the Goldman Sachs team as though it might have been digitally altered.” That is the eye-opening revelation in a new column by The Times’s Ben Smith about Ozy a digital media company that has raised tens of millions of dollars from investors like Laurene Powell Jobs Marc Lasry Ron Conway Axel Springer LionTree iHeart Media the Ford Foundation and others.

When Ozy was closing in on a $40 million investment from Goldman Sachs things got weird. On a conference call that Ozy arranged in February members of Goldman’s asset management division were expecting to hear from a YouTube executive about the media outlet’s extensive reach on the site. After the strange audio on the call the Goldman investors reached out to the YouTube executive. He said he wasn’t on the call.

Really weird: It turns out that Samir Rao the co-founder and C.O.O. of Ozy was impersonating the YouTube executive on the call according to four people who were briefed on the meeting. Carlos Watson the C.E.O. of Ozy attributed the incident to a mental health crisis. Rao took time off work after the call and is now back at Ozy. (Watson and Rao both once worked for Goldman.)

Ozy founded in 2013 has for years raised eyebrows over its claims about its audience size. “Trying to fool the world’s most famous bank even by the hype-ridden standards of the media business is way over the line” Ben writes. Watson told Ben in an email that he understood the skepticism but that Ozy’s growth “has been completely real.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDIxL29jdC8wMS9tZWRpYS1zdGFydHVwLW96eS1zaHV0cy1kb3duLWFmdGVyLW5ldy15b3JrLXRpbWVzLXJlcG9ydC1yYWlzZXMtY29uY2VybnPSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vbWVkaWEvMjAyMS9vY3QvMDEvbWVkaWEtc3RhcnR1cC1venktc2h1dHMtZG93bi1hZnRlci1uZXcteW9yay10aW1lcy1yZXBvcnQtcmFpc2VzLWNvbmNlcm5z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Media startup Ozy shuts down after New York Times report raises concerns,"Ozy a digital media startup is shutting down less than a week after a New York Times column raised questions about the organization’s claims of millions of viewers and readers while also pointing out a potential case of securities fraud.

The story triggered canceled shows an internal investigation investor concern and high-level departures at the company.

An emailed statement Friday from Ozy Media’s board called it a company with many “world-class journalists and experienced professionals to whom we owe tremendous gratitude”. It said it was “with the heaviest of hearts that we must announce today that we are closing Ozy’s doors”.

The board’s statement did not give the reason for shutting down the company based in Mountain View California. Ozy did not respond to questions about why it was shutting down now or how many employees it had.

Ozy’s CEO the former cable-news commentator and host Carlos Watson started Ozy in 2013. It published stories on its website made podcasts newsletters and shows and hosted the OzyFest festival. Its website remained up on Friday afternoon.

The Times story said Ozy’s chief operating officer and co-founder Samir Rao impersonated a YouTube executive on a call with Goldman Sachs while attempting to raise money from the investment bank. It also addressed long-held industry questions of whether Ozy was inflating its audience size.

In a tweet Watson claimed 25 million newsletter subscribers. The New York Times with a much bigger brand presence says it has 15 million newsletter readers and more than 30m views on YouTube. The Times said fewer than 500000 people went to Ozy’s website in June and July according to Comscore data.

On Thursday Marc Lasry the hedge-fund billionaire and Milwaukee Bucks co-owner who had been named Ozy’s chairman in September resigned citing Ozy’s need for someone experienced in crisis management and investigations. He remained an investor.

A high-profile employee former BBC anchor Katty Kay resigned earlier in the week and an early investor a venture capital firm gave up its Ozy shares. The board had reportedly hired a law firm to review Ozy’s business activities.

Cable network A&E pulled a special on mental health hosted by Watson that was scheduled for Monday night and Watson stepped down from hosting a documentary Emmys awards show on Wednesday night.

David Solomon who moonlights as a DJ in his spare time and is himself a collector of fine wine has been summoned by the family behind Don Simon sangria and faces the prospect of testifying as a witness in a Spanish criminal court.

John Waldron the bank’s chief operating officer has also been called to testify as a witness in the case.

The lawsuit relates to claims that the investment bank encouraged a former executive of J García Carrión to enter into unauthorised foreign exchange transactions.

The company claims that this former employee and one of their family members lined their pockets by entering into “a very large number of unauthorised transactions” with the “encouragement and/or pursuant to the recommendations” of Goldman Sachs.

The criminal proceedings are part of a broader scandal involving Goldman Sachs Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas with several Spanish companies claiming they were mis-sold foreign exchange instruments.

Goldman separately launched a legal challenge against the winemaker last year in an English court arguing that Garcia Carrion failed to make certain payments to the Wall Street behemoth.

Mr Solomon is himself a fine wine connoisseur with a huge collection at his home in East Hampton New York.

A spokesman for the bank said: “For years J Garcia Carrion profited without complaint from its use of FX derivatives with Goldman Sachs to manage its international currency exposure. It also published details of its derivatives activity in its audited accounts.

“The company’s refusal to make the payments due under the transactions in 2020 on the basis that these transactions were unknown to it and were beyond its capacity and authority was unjustifiable and left us with no option but to commence legal proceedings to recover the amount owed.”

A spokesman for J.Garcia Carrion said: “J.Garcia Carrion is determined to understand exactly what was going on within Goldman Sachs when these speculative and unauthorised trades were being conducted.

“We need to know who knew what and why this conduct was allowed to continue unchecked for so long. This is why we have asked the court in Spain to call senior management of the bank including David Solomon and John Waldron to give evidence in the case. We look forward to seeing them in court.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3Ivd3d3L2Jpei8yMDI0LzAxLzYwMl8zMTYzNTMuaHRtbNIBP2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYW1wLmFzcD9uZXdzSWR4PTMxNjM1Mw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Morgan Stanley maintains top position in local M&A advisory market,"Morgan Stanley's offices in New York / AP-Yonhap



By Anna J. Park



So far this year Morgan Stanley has been enjoying the top position among finance companies providing advisory services to local companies going through mergers and acquisitions (M&As).



Morgan Stanley is more than 3 trillion won ($2.5 billion) ahead of JPMorgan which has been in the second position in the M&A advisory market so far this year in terms of the total value of M&A deals they have made based on their advisory services. So it is highly likely that Morgan Stanley will maintain its top position until the end of this year.



The $4 billion acquisition deal for Korea's top food delivery app Baemin is the main reason Morgan Stanley has been the top player in the local M&A advisory market this year.



Morgan Stanley also advised on other major M&A deals including the sale of global communication platform Hyperconnect to U.S.-based Match Group the sale of Samsung Display's LCD factory in China to CSOT and the sale of Job Korea to Affinity Equity Partners. The global finance company also advised on another major deal here the sale of eBay Korea for 3.4 trillion won to retailer E-mart.



JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs follow in the top M&A advisory player list as they took the second and third positions in terms of cumulative deals in the first three quarters of this year.



JPMorgan in particular had been shut out of the top 10 list during the first quarter of this year. Yet it jumped to the top three in the second quarter with the completion of major deals including HYBE's acquisition of Ithaca Holdings and the sale of waste management firm Clenco.



The total amount of cumulative M&A deals during the first three quarters of this year reached 54.9 trillion won with 416 deals. This figure is a huge increase from the 35.6 trillion won made from 320 deals logged in the same period of last year.

By Ronni Newton

The lawn of what has become commonly known as the “Pumpkin Church” in West Hartford was devoid of its sea of orange gourds last year due to COVID-19 concerns but the “Pumpkin Patch” which has otherwise been held for more than 25 years has returned.

“We received our first delivery of over 2000 pumpkins and they are colorfully displayed on our front lawn” Larry Wilder chair of the West Hartford United Methodist Church said in an email. “They will be for sale for the entire month of October.”

The Pumpkin Patch includes a wide variety of gourds in an array of sizes shapes and textures. Included are bumpy pumpkins white and pink pumpkins mini “pumpkins” and “swan gourds” that can be dried and hollowed out to create bird houses.

All are “Pumpkins with a Mission” as the sign states supporting ministries of the church that includes the United Methodist Army South Park Inn Homeless Shelter the Friendship Service Center of New Britain and other organizations.

The Pumpkin Patch is open Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Saturdays from 9 a.m.-7 p.m. and Sundays from 10 a.m.-7 p.m. through the end of October.

Throughout the month of October the church is also holding a food drive to support the local food pantry. Non-perishable and unopened/unexpired donations can be left in the bin by the front door at any time of the day. Spaghetti pasta sauce peanut butter (16-18oz jars) canned fruit apple sauce tuna rice (1-2 lb. packages) and soups are the most critical items.

West Hartford United Methodist Church will also host its inaugural “Pumpkin Festival” on Oct. 23 from 11 a.m.-4 p.m. (Rain date is Oct. 24.) There will be baked goods and other vendors children’s games and activities and visit from the West Hartford Fire Department. A few spots are still available and anyone interested in registering as a vendor can call the church at 860-521-7766.

A silent auction is available online from Oct. 15-24 and more information can be found here.

The church is located at 1358 New Britain Ave. at the corner of Berkshire Road. Exit 40 off I-84 one block east of Westfarms and Corbins Corner.

Like the previous deluxe boxed figures it consists of ten items with premium deco and accessories at the upsale price of $26.49 per regular-sized figure plus some oversized items costing more. Presumably they will find a way to brand even more if this works out as it’s bringing some real fan-favorites to the table.

As we’ll see it’s also exposing some surprising inconsistencies. Most Superhero Hype toy reviews are based on samples sent directly from the company. But in this case we purchased five of the ten items ourselves to check out. Herewith a look at Surtur Odin Obadiah Stane with Iron Monger Captain Marvel with Rescue and Iron Man vs. Thanos.

The other five are MCU Quicksilver Iron Man Happy Hogan with Iron Man Endgame Thor and Infinity War Captain America. A less visually interesting bunch overall.

Surtur is the sort of character Hasbro would not have made at all twenty years ago. Recall that Toy Biz couldn’t make a Lord of the Rings Balrog because Walmart refused to sell a flaming demon. But now Marvel has its own version of that concept and he’s on Target shelves as well as major online retailers. (Note: This review contains links to Entertainment Earth who are affiliate partners with Superhero Hype. SHH may earn fees from purchases made through these links.)

Anyway Thor’s Ragnarok opponent stands around 13 inches tall costs $52.99 and is made entirely of translucent plastic. He’s mildly sticky to the touch at first which unfortunately could get worse over time. That said the deco is fantastic and speaking of the f-word this body could easily see re-use for a 12-inch Johnny Storm if need be. Articulation wise he differs from a standard ML figure only in having a mid-torso ball joint and an ab crunch. Though that mid-torso one is one of those “clicky” joints that always feels scarily like it might break. So far so good. And the horns have some flex so they won’t easily break.

He may appear gigantic but Surtur can work as a regular human-sized demon next to other 12-inch figures too. If that’s your thing. He comes with a massive sword and alternate right open hand and left fist.

The next biggest figure is Iron Monger who towers over his human counterpart Obadiah at around 9 inches. As a nifty custom feature he includes different gun barrel effects including smoke a flame blast or a firing-and-blast effect. The shoulder pads are held by separate pistons to allow for arm movement. And while it doesn’t open up for Obadiah to get inside…it does sport a universal neck peg so Obadiah’s head can swap out with the mask. On his regular body Obadiah features an ARC reactor he can hold and an opening suitcase that absolutely does not hold the ARC reactor inside.

Still ever since Hasbro announced an Obdadiah fans have considered another head swap. It is Jeff Bridges after all so why not put his head on “Lebowski” Thor? Well turns out the scales aren’t quite perfect there. Perhaps that’s just like our opinion man. But it’s a good likeness of the actor.

Scale issues also come into play with the Iron Man who comes with Thanos in a $62.99 two-pack. Actual Robert Downey Jr. likenesses come few and far between with Hasbro usually only in premium sets. So since we get two it might be nice to use an extra one on a different figure. Alas that doesn’t work out so easily.

Hence the additional neck peg created for this Iron Man LXXXV. It’s mostly a repaint of the previous carded version but with a new upper torso to allow for the new neck.

Even if he were bald that human head would be bigger than the helmet head. It’s a proportion cheat big-time:

Thanos comes with multiple heads only one of which is totally new — the “dusted” head disintegrating after Tony’s snap. The others included are the build-a-figure armored head build-a-figure smiling head and Amazon boxed set grim face. His armor sports other modifications from the BAF — a new skirt a missing shoulder pad and damaged chest armor that also appears ready to get dusted.

The Stark gauntlet hand includes a fist with all the gems and a snapping hand with none of them. Good attention to detail there. The helicopter blade is also all-new.

Tony includes a snap hand as well as repulsor hands for the blast effects. He also can equip with an energy blaster and shield.

Another actor whose likeness only comes in deluxe packs is Gwyneth Paltrow. Rescue comes with two new heads for her but the prior MCU 10th head (right) arguably still looks best. On the new ones however eyeshadow appears to make all the difference. That half-masked head fits the least well on the neck peg in our version.

Rescue features a construction that is tremendously difficult to guess so that’s what reviews like this are for. She includes two backpacks just like the single-carded version. One feature on the “open” version that some may never have noticed is the lower gray panels that lift up.

Okay so step one is to pop those panels off. And then you can pop in the bonus floating shields via the balls on the end of the translucent rods. Like so.

A buyer might never figure that construction out normally. But both floating shields feature fold out panels and make Rescue look far more formidable. It’s worth doing.

Rescue also includes repulsor blasts but no hands to hold them. With a flight stand they will go into her foot peg holes of course.

Captain Marvel comes in the same package — an Amazon exclusive — in her Endgame outfit. Compared to her previous figure there’s hardly any metallic paint with brighter more comic-book colors. She also has a waist sash that looks like it may inspire Kamala Khan later. The new color scheme makes the body look more different than it actually is.

Carol comes with multiple hands and a Stark gauntlet. To fit that on her requires popping off a hand and that makes her arm looks a little short. On the other hand doing that with a male figure like Odin feels closer to the right length.

Speaking of Odin his two heads look so similar as to be barely distinguishable. In closeup photography the facial expression differences become more clear.

The helmet which casual viewers may not have realized sports both Loki horns and Thor wings fits both heads. The other major accessory is his staff and he also has a bonus right fist and left open hand.

While many of the figures in this collection do reuse existing parts there’s a whole lot of new and many key characters in this set. Surtur and Iron Monger in particular seemed like real longshots at one point and indicate that the line can really go anywhere. The Iron Man and Rescue feature much-needed upgrades. But the exposure of the lack of consistent scale vis-a-vis the potential headswaps is a bummer. At least they look great on the bodies they belong to.

How do we cultivate a new generation that is better and brighter?

The answer is simple: Hasbro. Obviously.

The newest permutation of Hasbro’s multimedia goldmine is “My Little Pony: A New Generation” and it asks an age-old question: What if horses were prejudiced?

In the whimsical land of Equestria they are. In some distant past the three breeds of Equestria — unicorns pegasi earth ponies (read: regular ponies … except that they can y’know talk and stuff) — had a great schism and now live isolated from each other eternally stoking their mutual hatred. They make up stories about each other — earth ponies smell funny pegasi eat people unicorns fry brains with their horn-lasers. All except for Sunny Starscout (Vanessa Hudgens “The Princess Switch: Switched Again”) an earth pony raised in the homey little hamlet of Maretime Bay by a scholar of ponykind and inveterate anti-racist. When bubbly unicorn Izzy Moonbow (Kimiko Glenn “Over the Moon”) wanders into town Sunny is forced to embark on an epic quest to safeguard her new unicorn friend track down some magical gems and return magic to the land of Equestria.

There are a number of things askew with the world of “My Little Pony.” Maretime Bay for example is pretty much just a regular human town completely unaffected by the fact its inhabitants are hoofed and hirsute. They have cell phones and stoves and pencils and doorknobs and things … never mind their lack of hands or bipedalism.

But let’s hold our horses. This is “My Little Pony.” It’s about chromatic little horses powered by the magic of friendship. While it has perhaps unpredictably garnered a wide and diverse audience it is primarily intended for children. Spending time on things like “verisimilitude” and “fidelity to reality” completely misses the point. Never mind pondering how ponies produce and consume canned goods or operate heavy machinery — the power of friendship supersedes such trivialities goddammit.

Because y’know what? “My Little Pony: A New Generation” isn’t that bad. While the world of Equestria inexplicably mirrors our own in every architectural ergonomic and technological sense it’s likewise filled with clever and cutesy little touches that make the 90-minute runtime pass relatively smoothly. A pony rollerblades another pony descends into fascism and at another point ponies compete in something called “Prance Prance Revolution”; each is something of an absurdist delight. Songs (yes it’s got musical numbers) are pleasant if not entirely catchy jokes aren’t too sophisticated but well-executed and mercifully light on the horse puns and the world-building — from the crystalline woods of the unicorns to the art deco metropolis of the pegasi — is fun and varied if a tad elementary.

The film’s weakest point lies in its characters. As our equine heroine Sunny prances around Equestria in search of magic gems she picks a merry band of strays (as is the plot of all too many films). Except for their roles in advancing the plot and setting up the ultimate theme of ooey-gooey friendship and unity each character adds just about nothing to the group dynamic. The only bright spot is Hitch Trailblazer (James Marsden “Westworld”) who supplies a fair number of laughs and most satisfyingly allows for the theme of pony solidarity to shine through as you watch his steady conversion from earth pony sheriff to protector of ponykind.

“My Little Pony” isn’t for everyone. It isn’t for me for one. And “My Little Pony: A New Generation” isn’t the most breathtaking work Netflix has distributed — it’s largely unoriginal mostly unchallenging and possessed by woefully uninspired animation (every kids ’ movie has to have that soft rounded CGI style these days). But insofar as a movie about prejudiced ponies goes it’s light and cute and a reasonable introduction for our newest generation to some of the world’s headier problems. So y’know. Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth.

The video is the result of Make-A-Wish connecting 12-year-old Brooker with the stop motion team at Reckless Abandonment Pictures to create the short because that’s what Brooker’s wish was! Booker has a rare disease called Shwachman-Diamond.

The video came with the following details for the project:

Oklahoma studio Reckless Abandonment Pictures is back at it again with a ""Bat-Tastic"" stop motion to make a wish come true for a 12-year-old kid facing a rare disease by helping him create a Batman stop-motion animation. Happy Batman month y'all!

Reckless Abandonment creative director Kyle Roberts is known for his stop-motions animating commercial work for LEGO DreamWorks Disney Hasbro Mattel etc.

“Make-A-Wish contacted me and told me that they have a 12-year-old kid that loves animation and our stop motions” Roberts said.

Booker who has a rare disease called Shwachman-Diamond has a passion for stop-motion animation and wanted to check out the Reckless Abandonment studio for his wish.

“I felt honored they even thought of us but wanted to level up Booker's wish by actually producing a STOP MOTION ANIMATION with him! So the wish was set for Booker to produce a stop motion with our team” Roberts said.

“Starting pre-production we asked Booker who his favorite superheroes are. First up Batman then Superman Joker Harley Quinn Wonder Woman and Robin. Our team crafted a short story with Booker and once we got the story locked in began storyboarding and animating the stop motion” Roberts said. Booker's take on why he loves Batman; ""Three main reasons. Because he is good with tech (Batarangs). He is trained as a Ninja. His costume and personality are scary but he is good."" All fair points!

Booker came to the studio for one of the animating days and also made a live action cameo with his dad! After 1200 individual photos and 3 weeks of work the stop motion animation part of the production was wrapped. Booker also came to the studio for a day during post production where the team walked through tricks and tips in compositing and rotoscoping. ""I liked getting to hang out with people who like stop motion as much as I do. I'm thankful for the Reckless team for explaining how it works. It was a dream come true to make this stop motion with them"" Booker said.

""I am very thankful that the Reckless and Make-A-Wish looks out for kids like me who have an illness"" Booker Said.

“Booker is such a radical dude” Roberts said. “I was amazed how quickly he picked up animating with the toys. Booker is also a pretty incredible artist. Our team took one of his drawings and 3D Printed/Painted it! Meet Papalo a teenage mutant plant dude! Booker had a whole back story on Papalo. I asked him if he was a Hero or Villain... and Booker said ‘He's a little of both.’”",,,

Female optimised training is something athletes have long been adept at but it has the potential to positively impact anyone’s physical and mental health whether involving intensive exercise or not.

“Your menstrual cycle can have an extremely beneficial impact on your exercise and vice versa” explains Dr Ajai Seth consultant in sport and exercise medicine at London Bridge Hospital part of HCA Healthcare UK. “Hormonal fluctuations during the cycle can positively influence your energy levels and performance. In addition the endorphin and serotonin release during and after exercise has an antidepressant and mood-elevating effect helping us through menstrual symptoms. These hormones can also alleviate pain such as cramping and bloating by aiding digestion.”

However he notes that it’s important to remember that everyone's body is different and we don't all respond to hormonal fluctuations in the same way. In addition menstrual cycle lengths can vary drastically – so a ‘one size fits all’ approach can’t be taken to cycle synching.

Hailing from New York dynamic fitness method has plugged into the zeitgeist with its new clinically-backed cycle-syncing programme named .

With a crack team of experts behind it – from certified trainers to an obstetrician-gynaecologist nutritionist health coach and more – the virtual series intends to match your movement meals and mindset to the ebb and flow of your hormones.

Personalised to you (tracked via details about the timings and length of your period and cycle) it provides an individualised workout and nutrition plan as well as expert-led education for the four phases of the menstrual cycle; menstrual follicular ovulatory and luteal. The results can mean reduced PMS increased energy and performance plus improved weight management.

If you’re interested in exploring the idea without commitment Dr Seth explains the basics of aligning your exercise programme to your cycle.

When and how to work out around your cycle

Note: day one of your cycle is the first day of your period. “During your period at the start of your cycle progesterone and oestrogen levels are at their lowest which can cause low energy and mood fluctuations” explains Dr Seth. “However during the first 14 days of your cycle (the follicular phase) your body adapts and responds to strength training better than in the later stages of your cycle. It is easier to build and gain strength and muscle mass during this time.” Therefore he suggests incorporating strength routines (such as Pilates and weight training) with light cardio during this time to maximise this affect.

“Around the time of ovulation (day 14) there is a surge in oestrogen and testosterone levels” Dr Seth confirms. “Many athletes time their performances and are exertional training for this time to maximise their results.” Higher training intensity and volumes may be more achievable mid-cycle he advises.

“In the last 14 days of the cycle – the luteal phase – progesterone levels start to rise and can have more of a depressant effect. This is the time where women should be boosting serotonin and endorphin levels to alleviate these symptoms but recognising there may be a slight dip in performance.” He suggests “steady training with slightly lower intensity may be more suitable during this time”.

Of course as well as the benefits of exercise on your cycle always be mindful of potential negative effects. “If you feel that exercise is negatively affecting your cycle and you experience missing periods this certainly needs further investigation to make sure your metabolic balance is correct” Dr Seth notes.

Diet and your cycle

Within P.volve’s programme meals are where much of the personalised experience comes into play. Registered dietician Vanessa Rissetto who designed the nutrition portion of ‘Phase & Function’ explains that she curated nutritional options that complement the workouts “to properly fuel your body in accordance with your hormones”.

Indeed a bespoke approach is always advised when cycle-syncing your diet. “Calorie expenditure​ throughout the menstrual cycle is very individualised” explains Dr Seth. “There are so many variables that affect our metabolic activity and calorie expenditure in day-to-day life.” Having said that he notes there is some evidence to suggest that women are more likely to crave high-fat and sweet foods during the later stages of their period (luteal phase) pre-menstruating “which could suggest a natural response to increased calorie burn during this phase”.

He says the key is to listen to your body's requirements with regards to appetite fatigue and mood and respond with the appropriate exercise plan. “Keeping a balanced diet throughout your cycle but also matching your calorie intake to your exercise volume and intensity will always ensure you get the adequate amount of energy.”",,,,,,,,,

The seasonal beer debuted in 2019 and has been hitting shelves every fall since. It is now available in bottles and on draft in more than 22 states.

""It's year three of the most epic chocolate and beer collaboration and this year we're combining the return of the Yuengling Hershey's Chocolate Porter with our favorite holiday Halloween"" Ernie Savo senior director global licensing for The Hershey Company said.

The limited-run release porter is based on Yuengling's Dark Brewed Porter recipe. Hershey's cocoa powder and chocolate nibs are added during the brewing process according to the description on the brewery's website.

When the Yuengling Hershey's Chocolate Porter debuted in 2019 the plan had been for the beer to be available through Valentine's Day but it sold out within weeks PennLive reported. While many breweries make chocolate beers this was Yuengling's first attempt.

The brew has an ABV of 4.7% and pairs well with chocolate barbecue and cheeses the brewery says.

Police officers in this quiet little town raked up more overtime last year than any police department in Dauphin County except Harrisburg. And despite the recent arrest of a man with explosives in his home crime in Middletown is no where near what police have to deal with in Harrisburg.

A police incident shuts down streets in Middletown. September 8 2021. Dan Gleiter | dgleiter@pennlive.com

The average police officer in Dauphin County made $4000 in overtime. In Middletown the average police officer netted $23435.

Sgt. Scott Yoder logged in more than 1000 hours of overtime last year the second-highest amount on the force –increasing his salary from $93910 to $169107. Despite the long hours on his main job Yoder had enough time and energy to work part-time at the Milton Hershey School. Incredible.

But Yoder’s hours take second place to what the acting police chief logged. Police chiefs are usually salaried employees without overtime but Middletown Acting Chief Dennis Morris logged a total of 3667 overtime hours last year.

From left Middletown police Sgt. Scott Yoder Sgt. Dennis Morris Chief George Mouchette and Patrolman Tyler Zehring in a photo from Aug. 7 2017.Dan Miller Middletown Press & Journal

If the numbers are right Morris was able to accrue pay for 10-hour days every day of the week -- for the whole year.

Something is clearly wrong.

Let’s be honest either these police officers aren’t working all of those hours or they’re dogged tired -- all of the time. And no one wants a dogged tired police officer pulling him over in the middle of the night.

The Middletown Police Department is suffering from grave mismanagement and it impacts many more people than just residents of Middletown home to the region’s international airport. It affects every person who drives through the little borough including students on the campus of Penn State Harrisburg.

As one expert noted there are serious repercussions when a police officer repeatedly works excessive amounts of overtime. The short list includes:

Heightened “implicit bias” among sleep-deprived officers– of particular concern to Black and Brown students on the Penn State Harrisburg campus.

More complaints filed against police officers who work excessive overtime.

More car crashes among officers who work long hours and an inconsistent schedule.

There’s also the issue of officers too burned out to do their jobs.

Vendel’s in-depth investigation into the extraordinary police overtime in Middletown should compel authorities to immediately audit the department’s records. First we need to know if the unbelievable number of hours officers claim to work is true.

And if the records are accurate it’s a dangerous situation with potentially tragic repercussions. Residents should demand officials better manage their tax dollars and reign in police overtime. If every other police department in the county can do it what’s wrong with Middletown?

The building is the tallest in the area.

A BCP Council planning officer report said the changes being requested would mainly have been to the rear of the main Hilton Hotel and sought to add two floors to the Hampton by Hilton building also extending the lift shaft and stairwell.

The original design concept of the building was for the blocks to progressively decrease in height as they step up the hill to respect the scale of the listed buildings in Upper Terrace Road and to fit in with the corner of Exeter Road and Cranborne Road by locating the majority of the height at that point.

A report into the application concluded that the changes would “create an uncomfortable anomaly which would detract from the appearance of the existing development and consequently the character and appearance of the wider area” included the terraced buildings diagonally across the road from the site: “The original hotel design includes a clear set back to only present four storeys immediate adjacent to the listed terrace however enlarging this to six storeys across from the three (above ground) storeys of the (listed) domestic terrace is deemed overly dominant and a retrograde step.”

The report concludes that while there would be economic benefits of having additional bedrooms at the hotel the impact on the listed terrace buildings was not justified and would harm the character and appearance of the area.

In giving eight reasons for refusal the planning reports says: “It is considered that by reason of the siting scale and design of the extension the development would represent a bulky and poor design which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the area and to the setting of the Grade II Listed terrace at 1-9 Upper Terrace Road.”"

Not only is the frightening creature back for the 2021 holiday but it brought a friend: The 12-Foot Giant-Sized Inferno Pumpkin Skeleton With LifeEyes.

Last year The Home Depot introduced a skeleton so big so creepy that it became the viral sensation of Halloween. Not only is the frightening creature back for the 2021 holiday but it brought a friend: The 12-Foot Giant-Sized Inferno Pumpkin Skeleton With LifeEyes.

Trick-or-treaters just might be too scared to get their candy when you have the Inferno Pumpkin Skeleton in your front yard. Standing at 12 feet tall and 5.83 feet wide it has posable arms LCD glowing eyes and a flame light chest to add to the terrifying decoration. Instead of the classic bone color these skeleton has rotten-looking bones to add to the chilling vibe. The power adapter will make sure that it glows throughout the night.

If you didn’t get a chance to snag the 12-Foot Giant-Sized Skeleton With LifeEyes last year — it did sell out after all — here’s your chance to get it for your lawn. At 12 feet tall and 6.41 feet wide no other Halloween decoration could possibly compare. It starts with a durable metal frame that’s covered in “bones.” The battery- and adaptor-operated piece has LCD glowing eyes and has a 6-hours-on 18-hours-off time function. It was designed for indoor or outdoor use you know if you happen to have super high ceilings.

Both of the Inferno Pumpkin Skeleton and Skeleton are available to order from The Home Depot for $349 and $299 respectively. They each come with stakes to secure them to the ground. Since the regular skeleton was around last year the reviews are in and out of over 350 of them it has an average of 4.8 out of 5 stars. So you won’t be disappointed with this standout decoration.

Just like the Skeleton was can’t-miss Halloween decoration of 2020 it’s very possible that the Inferno Pumpkin Skeleton will take that spot this year. Both are officially available beginning July 16 so it’s only a matter of time until they’re all bought up!

Mr. Stanley died after being hit by a car less than a week ago on Pulaski Highway.

He touched many hearts in his 68-years of life.

A Home Depot parking lot was transformed into a service filled with singing glowing candles and heavy hearts to him Sunday evening.

“I’ve seen Mr. Stanley for the last 10 years walking up and down Route 40. My heart went out to him and his family when I found out the tragic news” said Scott Wilson who attended candle light vigil.

RELATED: Mr. Stanley's final steps

Wilson and his wife are among the hundreds walking away with memories of Mr. Stanley that will live long beyond his years.

“It’s overwhelming I’ll tell you that. I wasn't expecting this” said Frank Vingsen Stanley’s brother. “He was just a quiet guy in his own little world who did what he wanted to do.""

Folks who traveled up and down Pulaski Highway cherish the man they knew as “Pulaski Pete” “The Walking Man” and “That Guy.""

“The stories I hear about people he was in contact with it was… I just can’t get a handle on it. All of the people that wanted to help him and he didn’t want it. People wanted to give him money. He didn’t want it” Vingsen said.

The youngest of five a lover of all things outdoors especially fishing and hunting Stanley suffered from mental health issues sometimes battling them alone…but never unnoticed.

“I’m hoping the share of love of everybody around here can maybe uplift this whole world so we can love each other a lot more than what we are now” Wilson said.

His family established the Stanley Vingsen Memorial Fund to provide training and trauma informed-care to first responders dispatched to mental crisis emergencies.

Kylie Jenner and Kourtney Kardashian both showed off their fall decor as October kicked off.

Kardashian 42 is big on skeletons for Halloween this year as she showed off the massive outdoor skeletons greeting all of her visitors. TikTok has made Home Depot’s 12-foot skeletons very trendy and the Poosh founder managed to snag two of the frequently sold-out lawn ornaments. The duo appeared to be more than 10 feet tall extending well above the door and the bone-y decor continued inside.

In addition to skeleton loungewear and pumpkins shaped into skeleton heads the Keeping Up With the Kardashians alum also showed a glimpse of a dining room where a skeleton sat at a table covered in cobwebs and fake spiders. The black and white theme carried over into the mini pumpkins candles and other decor.

Kardashian included photos from her spooky season celebrations that took her outside of her home too. She posted a snap of The Spadena House also known as The Witch’s House a storybook home in Beverly Hills that looks like something out of The Nightmare Before Christmas as well as jack-o-lantern cotton candy.

Jenner 24 meanwhile is keeping her decor a little brighter for daughter Stormi 3. The Kylie Cosmetics founder showed off a bowl full of orange mini pumpkins a fuzzy decorative spider and an Amazon Handmade candle in the scent “Hello Fall” from Sweet Water Decor.

She even brought some Halloween spirit to the kitchen sharing a couple photos of seasonal cupcakes decorated with eyeball sprinkles and candy corn. While the first photo of baked goods clearly had the touch of a seasoned baker Stormi also got have some fun making a mess while icing her own cupcakes.

Jenner’s daughter who she shares with rapper Travis Scott is a big fan of October 31. “Stormi loves Halloween” Jenner told James Charles during a 2020 Halloween makeup tutorial. “She’s been talking about it for the last two months. She was so excited.”

Jenner who is expecting her second child with Scott and Kardashian who shares Mason 11 Penelope 9 and Reign 6 with ex Scott Disick got together with their other siblings for the holiday last year. They did a private family party with their nieces and nephews to allow the children to celebrate together since normal gatherings were called off due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Since Halloween is ‘canceled’ we can’t trick or treat or anything. We — me and [my sister] Kim [Kardashian] — decided to do something really special at her house” Jenner told the makeup guru. “We’re gonna have all the cousins over and I think we’re gonna do like fake little houses in our backyard so they can like trick or treat.”

""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

While we have already taken a ride in a Lucid Air very few people outside of the company have had the opportunity to actually get behind the wheel of one making this a special event indeed.

Interestingly the day we were at the factory Lucid announced that the start of series production for the all-electric luxury sedan had begun adding another layer of excitement at the facility while we were visiting. We were not told about that before arrival.

Lucid's path to production wasn't a direct one as there was a time when we openly wondered if the startup would ever make it to production. However led by former Tesla Model S chief engineer Peter Rawlinson Lucid secured the funding necessary finished development built out the factory and will be delivering vehicles to customers before the end of this month.

Quick Stats Lucid Air Dream Edition Motor: Two (One front & one rear) Dual ActiveCore OutPut: 1111 hp (Performance); 933 hp (Range) Drive Type: Full-time AWD (Both) 0-60: 2.5 sec. (Performance); 2.7 sec. (Range) Top Speed: 168-mph (Both) Range: 481 mi (Performance); 520 mi (Range) Price as tested: $169000 (Before incentives)

Both versions of the Dream Edition cost $169000 while the Air Grand Touring starts at $139000. The Air Touring will set you back $95000 and the entry-level Air Pure (RWD with available AWD) will have a starting price of $77400 before incentives.

Inside AMP-1

We toured both Lucid’s powertrain manufacturing facility as well as its Advanced Manufacturing Plant called AMP-1. There were workers as well as robots working diligently in both facilities but it was obvious that production had just begun as everything was moving much slower than what we're used to seeing in manufacturing plants.

But we've never actually been in a manufacturing facility on day one of production and the slow deliberate process was most certainly taking place to ensure quality. Lucid has previously talked about the fact that build quality is its top priority. We'd love to go back in a couple of months to compare the assembly line pace to what we saw at the start of production.

Lucid has only completed phase one of its production facility which is positioned on a 590-acre site in less than a year. Phase one will allow the company to produce up to 30000 vehicles per year. However Lucid plans to produce only 578 Air in 2021 and didn't give an exact prediction for total 2022 production.

Phase two of the facility is already under construction and once complete Lucid will have the ability to produce up to 90000 vehicles per year. The company then plans to begin phase three which will fully build out the site and give Lucid a manufacturing capacity of 400000 vehicles per year.

At the heart of Lucid's exceptionally efficient powertrain is the compact motor

Efficiency Deep Dive With Eric Bach

Lucid has its engineers available to answer questions and provide interviews and we were quick to schedule time with the Air's Chief Engineer Eric Bach. If I had a dollar for every time I've heard a Lucid representative say ""efficiency"" I could...well I couldn't exactly buy a Lucid Air but I may be able to take my wife out for dinner. The point is they say it all the time and credit the company's obsession with efficiency as the reason they were able to create such a powerful vehicle that can also deliver an EPA-rated 520 miles of driving range.

Powertrain efficiency is one of the things that Tesla does best. The legacy OEMs (with perhaps Hyundai as the exception) just can't seem to match Tesla's miles-per kWh efficiency. But Lucid has and in fact exceeded Tesla when comparing the Air against the Model S. The Air's battery pack is 112 kWh which is 12% larger than the Model S's 100 kWh pack.

However the longest-range Air delivers 28.5% more EPA-rated range than the longest-range Model S 520 miles to 405 miles respectively. We should point out that the Model S Long Range costs nearly half that of the Lucid Air Dream Edition Range $89990 to $169000. But regardless of the price Lucid accomplished something that nobody else has so far; they produced a desirable luxury EV that can compete performance-wise with the Model S has more interior and cargo space and is even more efficient.

We had recorded a long interview with Bach and originally considered cutting it down a bit. However we decided to run it in its full entirety because Bach offers a masterful explanation of what he and his team had to work on to deliver world-class efficiency in the Air. You could tell Bach loves what he does and would gladly talk about powertrain efficiency all night if given the opportunity.

He breaks down their work into four categories: aero rolling resistance auxiliary systems and powertrain efficiency. We provided timestamps in the description of the video for those that prefer to skip some of the conversations - not that we recommend that though.

Driving The Air Dream Edition Performance

Lucid had a lineup of both the Dream Edition Performance and Dream Edition Range versions and we waited for a 1111 hp Performance version to become available because hey the 933 hp offered in the Dream Edition Range just wouldn't be enough. <sarcasm>

We had a set route that included a driver swap at the turnaround point and Kyle Conner was my partner. Conner produced a fascinating first drive video of his own which can be viewed on the Out Of Spec Reviews YouTube channel.

We only had about 15 minutes of drive time so we'll have to wait until we get an Air for an extended period to conduct a proper full driving review. However the time we had was enough to learn a few things.

First off even though Lucid claims the Air Dream Edition Performance can run a quarter-mile in about 10 seconds (9.9 seconds to be exact) it's clear this is a premium luxury vehicle above all. You notice the feeling of openness and spaciousness as soon as you get in especially in the back seating area.

Upfront the seats are both supportive and stiff like how the seats in most premium German brands feel. There are adequate side bolsters but they aren't overly constrictive and allow the driver to move a bit.

The Air will offer three drive modes: Smooth Swift and Sprint. In Smooth and Swift mode the Dream Edition Performance puts out 804 hp with the full 1111 hp reserved for Sprint mode. The Dream Edition Range has 670 hp in Smooth and Sprint modes and increases to 966 hp in Sprint.

We did a few acceleration runs in Sprint mode and the 1111 hp powertrain didn't disappoint firmly planting all four passengers into their seats every time we punched the accelerator. From a standstill and at low speeds the Air didn't feel quite as potent as the 2021 Model S Long Range that I recently drove but from 30-mph on when I floored it the vehicle offered that same visceral feeling I remember from driving the Model S - like this is just too fast. Additionally I was alone in the Model S and there were four of us in the Air.

Cruising along at highway speeds all you need to do is tap the accelerator and you reach triple-digits in two or three seconds. It's hard to imagine any more than a handful of cars currently in production that can outrun a Dream Edition Performance from 50-mph to 100-mph.

The suspension was perfectly calibrated as far as I could tell for a short driving experience. While we were cruising along the highway it felt like we were gliding along effortlessly almost as if we were floating on - well air. Yet when you want to hit a turn at highway speeds the suspension system with semi-active dampers combine to offer precise handling and the steering is direct well-weighted.

We tried out the Air's ADAS called DreamDrive and the adaptive cruise control and lane-centering worked very well. There's a driver monitoring system that's meant to alert the driver if they aren't looking forward and paying attention but our car wasn't too keen on that. Both Kyle and I tried to get the system to warn us that we weren't paying enough attention but it didn't do so. Perhaps adjustments still need to be made to the monitoring system or it's possible the vehicle we were driving didn't have the final production software.

Wanting More

The small taste of driving the Air simply wasn't enough and left us wanting more. Besides a more comprehensive driving report we're anxious to conduct the InsideEVs 70-mph highway range test as well as full DC fast charge recordings. We're actively working with Lucid for more access and hope to have something to report on that front soon.

The Lucid Air is finally here despite the setbacks the company faced and that's a good thing - not only for investors but for the entire EV industry. Startups like Tesla and now Lucid and Rivian are helping to advance electrification at a pace that the legacy OEMs either can't or are unwilling to match. The Lucid Air moves the needle. It's not only a legitimate Tesla competitor but it will also take sales from Mercedes and BMW as well as the other premium sedan manufacturers both electric and ICE.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXJ5bGF1bmNoZXMuY29tL3RyYW5zcG9ydC9mYXJub3ZhLW90aGVsbG8taHlwZXJjYXIucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More powerful than the Bugatti Chiron this ultra-sleek 1810 hp electric hypercar is not from Italy or Germany but from ...,"

Yet another limited-production battery-electric hypercar has been announced and this time it’s from China. The electric hypercar is the creation of a company called Farnova Automotive that was founded in 2019. Strangely the automaker decided to name the hypercar after Shakespeare’s famous story Othello. Nevertheless Farnova plans on building 200 examples of the Othello hypercar from next year itself and with a price tag of 1.86 million yuan ($287578) which is in the same ballpark as the Tesla Roadster.





The detail of the Chinese electric hypercar are far and few between. However the little information we could find suggests the Othello will feature a chassis borrowed from the Qiantu K50 sportscar. The K50 is an electric two-door sports car also from China that was showcased in 2018. But Qiantu Motors has been struggling to keep afloat and the deal between the two brands could help in bringing new cash flow.



In terms of design the Othello doesn’t look bad but then prototypes and concepts rarely do! The hypercar has sharp lines and creases along with flared arches giving it a sporty muscular stance. One of the pictures also shows a massive wing at the back which could be active and also work as air brakes. It also comes with gullwing doors which immediately excites the child in me.



The Othello is fitted with two electric motors that can produce a combined output of 1810 hp and 12000 Nm of torque. We aren’t sure of the layout of the two motors but we are presuming that the two motors are placed at each axle giving the hypercar all-wheel drive. The performance figures quoted by the company are impressive and quite optimistic. Farnova claims the electric hypercar will be able to sprint from 0 to 62mph in just 1.8 seconds and hit a top speed of 261mph. The battery will be sourced from Swedish company Northvolt. The battery pack will have a capacity of 75 kWh and Farnova says the hypercar will have a range of 311 miles which is hard to believe.

Porsche first introduced the 912 back in the 1960s as a more affordable alternative to the 911 but Zelectric have removed its standard 90 hp engine and replaced it with the rear drive unit of a Tesla Model S. This motor pumps out 536 hp and is coupled to a 32 kWh battery pack. The car also features a brake regeneration system just like most EVs on the market and also allows for one-pedal driving.

Watch Also: Porsche Doesn’t Want To Build An Electric 911 So What’s This Electromodded 964 From Everrati Like?

As you would imagine the Tesla drive unit and battery pack aren’t light and weight around 620 lbs. By comparison the 912’s standard engine transmission and exhaust combine to weigh around 375 lbs so this electric-converted car is much heavier than when it left the Porsche factory. However with nearly 540 hp that extra weight is not an issue.

The compact 32 kWh battery pack allows the car to travel up to 140 miles (225 km) when the car is driven gingerly or 120 miles (193 km) when it is driven the way that a Porsche should. During this review Zelectric mentions that it is working on a 45 kWh variant that will offer more range.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYWN0b3JqdW5jdGlvbi5jb20vYmxvZy90b3AtMTAtYWMtY2FiaW4tdHJhY3RvcnMtaW4taW5kaWEtYWMtdHJhY3Rvci1wcmljZS1saXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 AC Cabin Tractor in India | AC Tractor Price List Tractor AC Cabin Price,"AC cabin tractors increase productivity provides you with extra mileage provides driver comfort etc. Technologically advanced Indian modern farmers Used AC Cabin Tractor for their ease.

During the 2016 Australian eCensus the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) conflated buying controls with shifting risk to another organization.

When a small DDoS disabled the eCensus and IBM the major technology partner was unable to mitigate the attack the ABS then doubled down and then tried to shift its responsibilities to the Australian Signals Directorate.

Buying tools and services should never be confused with absolving you of your technology risks.

In 2016 the Australian eCensus experienced a series of relatively minor DDoS events. In response IBM ABS’s outsourcing partner initiated its fortress Australia strategy and geo-blocked non-Australian web traffic. Unfortunately a router in Singapore was overlooked and the DDoS traffic continued to flood in.

When the DDoS finally stopped on its own IBM’s network performance monitoring system indicated outbound traffic from the census system that the company couldn’t identify. IBM and the ABS were therefore unable to confidently say whether this traffic was malicious or not.

At 8:09pm on Census Day with a growing sense of panic the ABS closed the eCensus for fear that it may have lost confidential information and called in the Australian Signal Directorate (ASD) to investigate.

Technically it was a series of unfortunate events: IBM overlooked a router in its planning couldn’t reach key routers due to congestion and one of its routers rebooted into a default configuration. Additionally network monitoring was based on the unreliable simple network management protocol (SNMP) which is designed to be dropped during congestion. So when everything eventually reconnected monitoring showed a large jump in the cumulative packet counters and this jump was incorrectly interpreted as data exfiltration.

However the biggest misstep of all came from the naïve assumptions made by the ABS. After engaging IBM the ABS essentially stopped thinking about the technical threats to the eCensus including the possibility of DDoS attack. They had engaged a world-leading company. They no longer had to worry about technical issues.

The ABS thought that it could pay IBM to take on its risk obligations. Instead the ABS conflated purchasing technology controls with shifting responsibility to another entity. This mindset continued when the ABS then tried to shift its responsibilities to the ASD. Two days later when the eCensus was eventually reinstated the damage was done and the reputation of the ABS and public confidence in the Australian Government’s ability to deliver online services was irreparably damaged.

Investing in buying controls mitigations and other tools and services is a great idea but it never absolves you of risk that is yours alone.

For me the lesson in the 2016 Census is that cybersecurity can be illusory. For those who find comfort in buying tools and services no amount of outsourcing will absolve you of your ownership of these risks and the inescapable accountability that comes when it all goes wrong. It’s a much safer strategy to go back to basics on risk and then pick the best solution for the problem.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zYWNiZWUvbmFtZS9kYWxlLW1pbGxlci1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xODgzOTMxNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dale Miller Obituary (1942 - 2021) - Sacramento CA - The Sacramento Bee,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/sacbee/name/dale-miller-obituary?id=18839316 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zYWNiZWUvbmFtZS9kYWxlLW1pbGxlci1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xODgzOTMxNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vaGFja2FkYXkuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMDMvc29tZS1wbGVhc2luZy1leHBlcmltZW50cy1pbi04LWJpdC12aWRlby1jYXJkcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Some Pleasing Experiments In 8-Bit Video Cards,"These days supply chain factors and high demand have made it incredibly difficult to lay one’s hands on a GPU. However if you’re into older computers you might find it hard to source old-school video cards too. Fear not for [Dave’s Dev Lab] has been cooking up some experiments with a goal of eventually producing a new 8-bit ISA video card from scratch.

The long term goal is to recreate the original design of early IBM hardware namely the MDA and CGA video cards of decades past. The experiments center around the venerable Motorola 6845 which was widely used in computers in the 1980s. However [Dave] intends to make them suitable for outputting to modern screens using typical VGA and DVI outputs as well as those expected by modern TFT LCDs.

Thus far [Dave] has achieved successful VGA output in a 40×35 text mode. With an 8×16 font and the display running at 640×480 resolution at 60 Hz everything hums along nicely. Similar experiments with a modern 480×272 LCD display have also worked well.

There’s a long way to go before [Dave’s] hardware is playing Commander Keen but it’s great to see such effort being put into the platform. It could yet serve as a great upgrade for those wishing to use their vintage IBM metal without having to source a tired old CGA monitor.

We’ve seen similar work before too with the Graphics Gremlin from [Tube Time] achieving a similar task.

While working in IT Felix Ayque began compiling cyclone reports and sending them as email alerts to communities. His work evolved into environmental intelligence platform Komunidad which collects data from government and private sources and turns it into customizable analytics to help clients react quickly to potential disasters.

The Manila and Singapore-based startup announced it has raised $1 million in seed funding led by Wavemaker Partners with participation from ADB Ventures the Asian Development Bank’s venture arm to expand in Asia and add features to its platform including a self-serve version that is slated for release in January 2022.

Founded in 2019 Komunidad has clients in the Philippines India Cambodia and Vietnam and serves multiple sectors including utilities agriculture mining education local governments and business outsourcing centers. Before launching the startup Ayque worked as an IT developer at several weather agencies including the state-owned New Zealand MetService. He began creating cyclone reports on his own as a consultant after Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 also known as Super Typhoon Yolanda which killed at least 6300 people in the Philippines.

The reports were meant to help businesses respond more quickly to natural disasters. Typhoon Haiyan hit at a time when the business outsourcing sector was growing rapidly in the Philippines with many foreign companies setting up multiple offices in the country. During a typhoon businesses typically transfer workload to offices in areas that are not affected. Ayque’s first emails contained manual analysis of potential cyclones.

Demand for his reports grew as companies including energy providers needed to respond to climate change. Komunidad began earning enough revenue to expand and for Ayque to hire employees including meteorologists data scientists software developers and business development teams based in India and Southeast Asia. Its new investment will be used to build a scalable platform.

Komunidad’s data sources include major players like The Weather Company acquired by IBM in 2015 weather intelligence platform Tomorrow.io and several smaller environmental and weather data providers.

The platform turns data into dashboards relevant to their customers’ needs like severe weather solar marine soil moisture or air quality. “We act as a system integrator that only brings the relevant data and tells customers that this is the most important data” said Ayque. Komunidad also enables its customers to build their own alert systems. For example in the Philippines many customers send alerts through Viber one of the country’s most popular messaging apps or SMS to reach areas with unstable internet connections.

For customers in the energy sector Komunidad’s tools help them predict things like power usage based on temperature. It’s also been used by local governments to decide school cancellations. During the pandemic Komunidad helped cities monitor people density so they can decide what areas need more crowd control.

One of Komunidad’s competitive advantages is understanding what data is important in different areas. For example it recently closed a deal with the Assam State Disaster Management Agency (ASDMA) to focus on lighting and thunderstorm alerts because Assam is the one of the most lightning-prone states in India.

“Every country has a different profile and we understand that our approach has to really focus on community and then extend to business” Ayque said.

Since Komunidad’s customers have to react quickly it creates easy-to-understand visualizations from raw data reports which are often incomprehensible to people without technical backgrounds. For example that might be a simple bar graph warnings in green yellow and red or maps that turn red if a major weather or environmental event is expected to occur within the next six hours.

Part of Komunidad’s funding will be used to launch self-service customizable dashboards next year that will allow clients to drag-and-drop widgets similar to creating a website in Wix or WordPress. The seed round will also help Komunidad take on new business opportunities in India Thailand Cambodia and other markets grow its sales teams and pay for more data sources."

ASML (ASML 1.83%) and Intel (INTC -0.80%) are two of the most important semiconductor companies in the world. ASML is the top supplier of photolithography systems which are used to etch circuit patterns into silicon wafers. Intel is the top producer of CPUs for PCs and data centers.

ASML is also the world's only provider of high-end EUV (extreme ultraviolet) systems which are used to manufacture the world's smallest chips. That's why it's a key partner for Intel which owns a small stake in ASML as well as its top foundry competitors TSMC and Samsung.

ASML and Intel both attracted a lot of attention throughout the global chip shortage which started in late 2019 and worsened throughout the pandemic. But over the past three years ASML's stock surged about 300% as Intel's stock rose less than 15%.

ASML benefited from the market's insatiable appetite for new photolithography systems while Intel struggled with ongoing shortages delays and manufacturing issues. Let's take a fresh look at both companies and see if ASML remains a stronger investment than Intel.

ASML continues to fire on all cylinders

ASML's revenue rose just 8% in 2019 as the global glut in memory chips curbed the market's appetite for new systems. However its revenue increased 18% in 2020 as the memory market stabilized and the top foundries boosted their capacity to cope with the surging demand for new chips.

ASML's earnings per share increased just 1% in 2019 but jumped 38% in 2020 as it sold more higher-margin EUV systems. Its total EUV sales rose 60% and accounted for 32% of its full-year revenues.

In the first half of 2021 ASML's revenue rose 45% year over year as its EPS soared 110%. Analysts expect its full-year revenue and earnings to grow 35% and 58% respectively as TSMC Samsung and Intel install more EUV systems. All three foundries are spending billions of dollars on building new plants and a lot of that money will flow to ASML.

Next year analysts expect ASML's revenue and earnings to increase 15% and 22% respectively. Its growth will likely decelerate as the chip shortage ends but its business should keep expanding over the long term as it rolls out its next generation of high-NA EUV systems -- which will be used to manufacture chips that are even smaller than today's tiniest chips.

Intel prepares for a painful turnaround

Intel's revenue grew just 2% in 2019 but rose 8% in 2020 as it shipped more PC and data center chips throughout the pandemic. The shift to remote work boosted demand for new PCs while the heavier usage of online services forced data centers to upgrade their hardware.

Intel's adjusted EPS rose 6% in 2019 and grew 9% in 2020. However it boosted its EPS with billions of dollars in buybacks throughout both years instead of allocating that cash toward improving its R&D and manufacturing capabilities. That trend worried investors since Intel had already fallen behind TSMC and Samsung in the ""process race"" to create smaller and more advanced chips.

In the first half of 2021 Intel's revenue dipped 1% year over year as its EPS fell 18%. Those declines can be attributed to its market-share losses to AMD (AMD -0.31%) in the PC and data center markets as well as tough comparisons to the pandemic's initial impact a year ago.

Analysts expect Intel's revenue and earnings to decline 6% and 10% respectively this year. Intel's new CEO Pat Gelsinger who took the helm in February plans to aggressively expand Intel's manufacturing plants to reclaim the process lead from TSMC by 2025. That's an ambitious goal but there's no guarantee that it will succeed and reverse its market losses to AMD -- which currently outsources the production of its chips to TSMC's superior foundries.

The obvious winner: ASML

ASML trades at 47 times forward earnings while Intel has a much lower forward P/E ratio of 11. However ASML's near-monopoly in photolithography systems its role as a linchpin of the global semiconductor market and its robust growth rates all justify that higher valuation. Meanwhile Intel's stock deserves a lower valuation because it faces a grueling uphill battle against TSMC and AMD.

Intel's downside potential could be limited at these levels but ASML has a lot more upside potential -- especially as the global chip shortage drags on and highlights the importance of its EUV systems.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vaG90aGFyZHdhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaW50ZWwtYWxkZXItbGFrZS1wLW1vYmlsaXR5LWNwdS1yb2FkbWFwLWxlYWtz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alleged Intel Alder Lake Mobile CPU Roadmap Leaks With 14-Core Flagship,"





There is an ever-so-slight chance we could see laptops running on Alder Lake hardware before the end of the year accordingly to a supposedly leaked roadmap that has surfaced. More likely actual systems with mobile Alder Lake hardware inside will debut in early 2022 but if the roadmap is accurate the wait will not be very long either way.





Intel has already go on the record saying it plans to release Alder Lake this year though the initial launch is expected to be entirely focused on consumer desktop SKUs. In the past it has been suggested by the rumor mill that the first batch of Alder Lake CPUs will be higher end models including Intel's upcoming flagship the Core i9-12900K





Rumor also has it that Intel will announce Alder Lake sometime this month and then release the chips to retail in November . So where does that leave the inevitable mobile stack that will follow? Here's a look at the leaked roadmap...







Click to Enlarge (Source: WCCFTech)







If the roadmap is to be believed Intel's system integrator partners will begin production of higher end mobile Alder Lake-P processors in week 45 which falls in early November. Depending on supply and other factors it is possible that laptop makers could be ready to go by the end of the year but our hunch is the mobile lineup won't be announced that soon—perhaps an unveiling at CES in January is in the cards.





According to the roadmap obtained by WCCFTech Alder Lake-P will span 12-45W solutions with up to 14 cores. If going by past leaks the top SKUs will feature six high performance Golden Cove cores and eight power efficient Gracemont cores. So we'd be looking at 14-core/20-thread chips at the top of the stack.





It's also noted that Alder Lake-P will feature Xe graphics with up to 96 execution units as well as support for Thunderbolt 4  Wi-Fi 6E DDR5 and LPDDR5 and PCI Express 5.0. The way Alder Lake-P is positioned on the roadmap the lineup will overlaps previous (well current) generation H-series and U-series products essentially serving as replacements for both high performance and lower power mobile lineups.





Then there is Alder Lake-M a mobile series that will take the baton from Intel's ultra-low power Tiger Lake-U series (UP4 models). Alder Lake-M will manifest in 7-15W solutions just like the lineup it is replace and be offered with up to 10 cores.





Alder Lake-M will also feature Xe graphics with up to 96 execution units and support Thunderbolt 4 and Wi-Fi 6E. But on the memory side it will be paired with LPDDR5 and LPDDR4 solutions. It will also hitch its wagon to a narrower bus that being PCI Express 4.0 instead of 5.0. Production by laptop makers will commence in January 2022.

Intel's 12th Gen Alder Lake-P Rocks 14 Cores Alder Lake-M Rock 10 Cores First Laptop CPU Platform To Support DDR5 Memory

The roadmap that has leaked out shows the specific timeframe when system integrators will have their mobility products such as laptops and notebooks ready for launch. The two platforms we are going to focus on are the Intel 12th Gen Alder Lake-P and Alder Lake-M series.

Intel Alder Lake-P Series SKUs

The Intel Alder Lake-P series will be replacing the entire Tiger Lake-H45 H35 and UP3 portfolio of chips. It will max out at 14 cores in the top SKU which will comprise 6 Golden Cove cores & 8 Grace Mont cores. The parts replacing the Tiger Lake-UP3 series will feature 2 Golden Cove cores and 8 Gracemont cores. The chips will pack both GT2 and GT3 Xe configurations with up to 96 Execution units.

Intel Alder Lake-P 2 Big Cores + 8 Small Cores with a GT2/GT3 GPU 6 Big Cores + 8 Small Cores with a GT2/GT3 GPU



Other features of the platform will include support for Thunderbolt 4 PCIe Gen 5.0 lanes & WiFi 6E. When it comes to memory support the Intel Alder Lake-P chips will get both LPDDR5 and DDR5 configurations. It is likely that Intel will release Alder Lake-P first with LPDDR5 variants while the higher-end Tiger Lake-H successors will come outfitted with DDR5 memory.

Intel Alder Lake-M Series SKUs

Moving over to the Alder Lake-M lineup these chips will replace the Intel Tiger Lake-UP4 platform and max out at 10 cores comprising 2 Golden Cove cores and 8 Gracemont cores. The chips will be equipped with up to 96 EU Xe integrated graphics Thunderbolt 4 WiFi 6E but PCIe capabilities will still be limited to PCIe Gen 4. As for memory the laptops featuring Intel Alder Lake-M chips will be available in both LPDDR4X and LPDDR5 flavors.

Intel Alder Lake-M 2 Big Cores + 8 Small Cores with a GT2/GT3 GPU



The power limits and configurations for Intel's Alder Lake-P and Alder Lake-M chips also leaked out a while back which you can see below:

Tiger Lake-U Tiger Lake-H Alder Lake-P Alder Lake-M PL1 UP3: <=

28W UP4: <= 9W <= 45W (2 + 8 + 2): <= 15W

Now the roadmap is fairly new from what we have been told and according to the production window guideline for system integrators Intel Alder Lake-P CPUs will hit production between November 2021 - March 2022 while Alder Lake-M CPUs will hit production by January 2022 - April 2022. We would definitely hear Intel talk about its mobility chips in its upcoming 'ON' & CES 2022 event showcases.

YuuKi_AnS purchased one of the engineering samples that are now being offered on the Chinese second-hand market.

Intel Core i9-12900K ES2 Source: YuuKi_AnS

The QX7H is a pre-release engineering sample known as ES2 with clock speeds from 3.5 GHz to 4.5 GHz according to YuuKi himself. This processor is actually the flagship Core i9-12900K model except it is not shown in the system as such but probably shows up as something like Intel 0000.

This sample is actually an identical model which was posted by Linus Tech Tips on social media. The photo has already been taken down as it might have revealed the source. Those samples are obtained through the black market where people working for system integrators OEMs and motherboard makers are putting unused samples on sale.

It should be noted that ES2 is the second-stage sample. Intel Alder Lake had gone through the ES3 stage and has now switched to QS (qualification sample) models which are more or less what the end product will look like. The problem with ES2 samples is that their microcode cannot be updated which renders them useless at this point (they are a few months old). This is not the case with ES3 samples though. Thus the ES2 units will now become obsolete and it is a good opportunity to sell them except not in a fully legal way.

Intel Core i9-12900K will feature 16 cores and 24 threads. It is a heterogeneous design with small and big cores on a single die. YuuKi expressed interested in taking a die shot photo of the sample which is why we might see a high-resolution photo from him soon.

Intel Alder Lake has a new Z-height which is one of many reasons why it requires new cooling compatibility kits from CPU cooler makers.

The secret documents expose offshore dealings of the King of Jordan the presidents of Ukraine Kenya and Ecuador the prime minister of the Czech Republic and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The files also detail financial activities of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “unofficial minister of propaganda” and more than 130 billionaires from Russia the United States Turkey and other nations.

The leaked records reveal that many of the power players who could help bring an end to the offshore system instead benefit from it – stashing assets in covert companies and trusts while their governments do little to slow a global stream of illicit money that enriches criminals and impoverishes nations.

Among the hidden treasures revealed in the documents:

A $22 million chateau in the French Riviera – replete with a cinema and two swimming pools – purchased through offshore companies by the Czech Republic’s populist prime minister a billionaire who has railed against the corruption of economic and political elites.

More than $13 million tucked in a secrecy-shaded trust in the Great Plains of the United States by a scion of one of Guatemala’s most powerful families a dynasty that controls a soap and lipsticks conglomerate that’s been accused of harming workers and the earth.

Three beachfront mansions in Malibu purchased through three offshore companies for $68 million by the King of Jordan in the years after Jordanians filled the streets during Arab Spring to protest joblessness and corruption.

The secret records are known as the Pandora Papers.

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists obtained the trove of more than 11.9 million confidential files and led a team of more than 600 journalists from 150 news outlets that spent two years sifting through them tracking down hard-to-find sources and digging into court records and other public documents from dozens of countries.

The leaked records come from 14 offshore services firms from around the world that set up shell companies and other offshore nooks for clients often seeking to keep their financial activities in the shadows. The records include information about the dealings of nearly three times as many current and former country leaders as any previous leak of documents from offshore havens.

In an era of widening authoritarianism and inequality the Pandora Papers investigation provides an unequaled perspective on how money and power operate in the 21st century – and how the rule of law has been bent and broken around the world by a system of financial secrecy enabled by the U.S. and other wealthy nations.

The findings by ICIJ and its media partners spotlight how deeply secretive finance has infiltrated global politics – and offer insights into why governments and global organizations have made little headway in ending offshore financial abuses.

An ICIJ analysis of the secret documents identified 956 companies in offshore havens tied to 336 high-level politicians and public officials including country leaders cabinet ministers ambassadors and others. More than two-thirds of those companies were set up in the British Virgin Islands a jurisdiction long known as a key cog in the offshore system.

At least $11.3 trillion is held “offshore” according to a 2020 study by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Because of the complexity and secrecy of the offshore system it’s not possible to know how much of that wealth is tied to tax evasion and other crimes and how much of it involves funds that come from legitimate sources and have been reported to proper authorities.

Every corner of the world

The Pandora Papers investigation unmasks the covert owners of offshore companies incognito bank accounts private jets yachts mansions even artworks by Picasso Banksy and other masters – providing more information than what’s usually available to law enforcement agencies and cash-strapped governments.

People linked by the secret documents to offshore assets include India’s cricket superstar Sachin Tendulkar pop music diva Shakira supermodel Claudia Schiffer and an Italian mobster known as “Lell the Fat One.”

The mobster Raffaele Amato has been tied to at least a dozen killings. The documents provide details about a shell company registered in the United Kingdom that Amato used to buy land in Spain shortly before fleeing there from Italy to set up his own crime gang. Amato whose history helped inspire the highly praised movie “Gomorrah” is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

Amato’s attorney did not respond to ICIJ’s request for comment.

Tendulkar’s attorney said the cricket player’s investment is legitimate and has been declared to tax authorities. Shakira’s attorney said the singer declared her companies which the attorney said do not provide tax advantages. Schiffer’s representatives said the supermodel correctly pays her taxes in the U.K. where she lives.

In most countries it’s not illegal to have assets offshore or to use shell companies to do business across national borders. Businesspeople who operate internationally say they need offshore companies to conduct their financial affairs.

But these affairs often amount to shifting profits from high-tax countries where they are earned to companies that exist only on paper in low-tax jurisdictions. Using offshore shelters is especially controversial for political figures because they can be used to keep politically unpopular or even illicit activities from public view.

In popular imagination the offshore system is often seen as a far-flung cluster of palm-shaded islands. The Pandora Papers show that the offshore money machine operates in every corner of the planet including the world’s largest democracies. The key players in the system include elite institutions – multinational banks law firms and accounting practices – headquartered in the U.S. and Europe.

A document in the Pandora Papers shows that banks around the world helped their customers set up at least 3926 offshore companies with the assistance of Alemán Cordero Galindo & Lee a Panamanian law firm led by a former ambassador to the U.S. The document shows that the firm – also known as Alcogal – set up at least 312 companies in the British Virgin Islands for clients of the American financial services giant Morgan Stanley.

A Morgan Stanley spokesperson said: “We do not create offshore companies. . . . This process is independent of the firm and at the discretion and direction of the client.”

The Pandora Papers investigation also highlights how Baker McKenzie the largest law firm in the U.S. helped create the modern offshore system and continues to be a mainstay of this shadow economy.

Baker McKenzie and its global affiliates have used their lobbying and legislation-drafting know-how to shape financial laws around the world. They have also profited from work done for people tied to fraud and corruption reporting by ICIJ has found.

The people that the firm has done work for includes Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky who U.S. authorities allege laundered $5.5 billion through a tangle of shell companies purchasing factories and commercial properties across the U.S. heartland.

Baker McKenzie also did work for Jho Low a now-fugitive financier accused by authorities in multiple countries of masterminding the embezzlement of more than $4.5 billion from a Malaysian economic development fund known as 1MDB. ICIJ’s reporting found that Low relied on Baker McKenzie and its affiliates to help him and his associates build a web of companies in Malaysia and Hong Kong. U.S. authorities allege they used some of those companies to shift money looted from 1MDB.

A spokesperson for Baker McKenzie said the firm seeks to provide the best advice to its clients and strives “to ensure that our clients adhere to both the law and best practice.”

The spokesperson didn’t directly address many questions about Baker McKenzie’s role in the offshore economy citing client confidentiality and legal privilege. But he said the firm performs strict background checks on all potential clients.

‘You know who’

The Pandora Papers investigation is larger and more global than even ICIJ’s landmark Panama Papers investigation which rocked the world in 2016 spawning police raids and new laws in dozens of countries and the fall of prime ministers in Iceland and Pakistan.

The Panama Papers came from the files of a single offshore services provider: the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. The Pandora Papers shine a light on a far wider cross-section of the lawyers and middlemen who are at the heart of the offshore industry.

The Pandora Papers provide more than twice as much information about the ownership of offshore companies. In all the new leak of documents reveals the real owners of more than 29000 offshore companies. The owners come from more than 200 countries and territories with the largest contingents from Russia the U.K. Argentina and China.

The 150 news outlets that joined the investigative partnership include The Washington Post the BBC The Guardian Radio France Oštro Croatia the Indian Express Zimbabwe’s The Standard Morocco’s Le Desk and Ecuador’s Diario El Universo.

A global team was needed because the 14 offshore providers that are the sources of the leaked documents are headquartered around the globe from the Caribbean to the Persian Gulf to the South China Sea.

Three of the providers are owned by former senior government officials: a former government minister and presidential adviser in Panama and a former attorney general of Belize who controls two providers.

For a few hundred or a few thousand dollars offshore providers can help clients set up a company whose real owners remain hidden. Or for perhaps $2000 to $25000 they can set up a trust that in some instances allows its beneficiaries to control their money while embracing the legal fiction that they don’t control it – a bit of paper-shuffling creativity that helps shield assets from creditors law enforcement and ex-spouses.

Offshore operatives don’t work in isolation. They partner with other secrecy providers around the globe to create interlocking layers of companies and trusts. The more complex the arrangements the higher the fees – and the more secrecy and protection clients can expect.

The Pandora Papers show that an English accountant in Switzerland worked with lawyers in the British Virgin Islands to help Jordan’s monarch King Abdullah II secretly purchase 14 luxury homes worth more than $106 million in the U.S. and the U.K. The advisers helped him set up at least 36 shell companies from 1995 to 2017.

In 2017 the king bought a $23 million property overlooking a California surfing beach through a company in the BVI. The king paid extra to have another BVI company owned by his Swiss wealth managers act as the “nominee” director for the BVI company that bought the property.

In the offshore world nominee directors are people or companies paid to front for whoever is really behind a company. Application forms sent to clients by Alcogal the law firm working on the king’s behalf say that the use of nominee directors helps “preserve privacy by avoiding the identity of the ultimate principal . . . being publicly accessible.”

In emails offshore advisers used a code name for the king: “You know who.”

U.K. attorneys for the king said that he is not required to pay taxes under Jordanian law and that he has security and privacy reasons to hold property through offshore companies. They said the king has never misused public funds.

The attorneys also said that most of the companies and properties identified by ICIJ have no connection to the king or no longer exist but declined to provide details.

Experts say that as ruler of one of the Middle East’s poorest and most aid-dependent countries the king has reasons to avoid flaunting his wealth.

“If the Jordanian monarch were to display his wealth more publicly it wouldn’t only antagonize his people it would piss off Western donors who have given him money” Annelle Sheline an expert on political authority in the Middle East told ICIJ.

In neighboring Lebanon where similar questions about wealth and poverty have been playing out the Pandora Papers show top political and financial figures have also embraced offshore havens.

They include the current prime minister Najib Mikati and his predecessor Hassan Diab as well as Riad Salameh the governor of Lebanon’s central bank who is under investigation in France for alleged money laundering.

Marwan Kheireddine Lebanon’s former minister of state and the chairman of Al Mawarid Bank also appears in the secret files. In 2019 he scolded former parliamentary colleagues for inaction amid a dire economic crisis. Half the population was living in poverty struggling to find food as grocers and bakeries closed.

“There is tax evasion and the government needs to address that” Kheireddine said.

That same year the Pandora Papers reveal Kheireddine signed documents as owner of a BVI company that owns a $2 million yacht.

Al Mawarid Bank was one of many in the country that restricted customers’ U.S. dollar withdrawals to stem economic panic.

Wafaa Abou Hamdan a 57-year-old widow is among the regular Lebanese who remain angry at their country’s elites. Because of runaway inflation her life savings plummeted from the equivalent of $60000 to less than $5000 she told Daraj an ICIJ media partner.

“All my life’s efforts went in vain. I have been working continuously for the past three decades” she said. “We are still struggling on a daily basis to maintain our living” while “the politicians and the bankers” have “all transferred and invested their money abroad.”

Kheireddine and Diab did not respond to requests for comment. In a written response Salameh said he declares his assets and has complied with reporting obligations under Lebanese law. Mikati’s son Maher said it is common for people in Lebanon to use offshore companies “due to the easy process of incorporation” rather than a desire to evade taxes.

‘Coalition of the corrupt’

Imran Khan was elated when ICIJ’s Panama Papers investigation came out in April 2016.

“The leaks are God-sent” the Pakistani politician and former cricket superstar said.

The Panama Papers revealed that the children of Pakistan’s prime minister at the time Nawaz Sharif had ties to offshore companies. This gave Khan an opening to hammer Sharif his political rival on what Khan described as the “coalition of the corrupt” ravaging Pakistan.

“It is disgusting the way money is plundered in the developing world from people who are already deprived of basic amenities: health education justice and employment” Khan told ICIJ’s partner The Guardian in 2016. “This money is put into offshore accounts or even western countries western banks. The poor get poorer. Poor countries get poorer and rich countries get richer. Offshore accounts protect these crooks.”

Ultimately Pakistan’s top court removed Sharif from office as a result of an inquiry sparked by the Panama Papers. Khan swept in to replace him in the next national election.

ICIJ’s latest investigation the Pandora Papers brings renewed attention to the use of offshore companies by Pakistani political players. This time the offshore holdings of people close to Khan are being disclosed including his finance minister and a top financial backer.

The documents also show that Khan’s water resources minister Chaudhry Moonis Elahi contacted Asiaciti an Singapore-based offshore services provider in 2016 about setting up a trust to invest the profits from a family land deal that had been financed by what the lender later claimed was an illegal loan. The bank told Pakistani authorities that the loan had been approved due to the influence of Elahi’s father a former deputy prime minister.

Asiaciti records say that Elahi backed off from putting money into a trust in Singapore after the provider told him it would report the details to Pakistani tax authorities.

Elahi did not respond to ICIJ’s requests for comment. Hours before the release of Pandora Papers stories a family spokesman told ICIJ media partners that “misleading interpretations and data have been circulated in files for nefarious reasons.” The spokesman added that the family’s assets “are declared as per applicable law.”

Also today a spokesperson for Khan told a press conference that if any of his ministers or advisors had offshore companies “they will have to be held accountable.”

Other political figures have also spoken out against the offshore system while surrounded by appointees and other supporters who have assets stowed offshore. Some who have spoken out have used the system themselves.

“Every public servant’s assets must be declared publicly so that people can question and ask – what is legitimate?” Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta told the BBC in 2018. “If you can’t explain yourself including myself then I have a case to answer.”

The leaked records listed Kenyatta and his mother as beneficiaries of a secretive foundation in Panama. Other family members including his brother and two sisters own five offshore companies with assets worth more than $30 million the records show.

Kenyatta and his family did not reply to requests for comment.

Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis one of his country’s richest men rose to power promising to crack down on tax evasion and corruption. In 2011 as he became more involved in politics Babis told voters that he wanted to create a country “where entrepreneurs will do business and will be happy to pay taxes.”

The leaked records show that in 2009 Babis injected $22 million into a string of shell companies to buy a sprawling property known as Chateau Bigaud in a hilltop village in Mougins France near Cannes.

Babis has not disclosed the shell companies and the chateau in the asset declarations he’s required to file as a public official according to documents obtained by ICIJ’s Czech partner Investigace.cz. In 2018 a real estate conglomerate indirectly owned by Babis quietly bought the Monaco company that owned the chateau.

Babis didn’t respond to requests for comment.

A spokesman for the conglomerate told ICIJ that it complies with the law. He didn’t respond to questions about the acquisition of the chateau.

“Like any other business entity we have the right to protect our trade secrets” the spokesman wrote.

‘A haven of scams’

The secret files provide a layer of behind-the-curtain context to public pronouncements this year about wealth and offshore refuges — as governments around the world struggle with revenue crunches a pandemic climate change and public distrust.

In February a commentary from the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change urged policymakers to seek among other measures higher taxes on land and homes. Blair the institute’s founder and executive chairman talked about how the rich and well-connected shirk paying their share of taxes as far back as 1994 when he campaigned to become the leader of the U.K.’s Labour Party.

“For those who can employ the right accountants the tax system is a haven of scams perks … and profits” he said during a speech in England’s West Midlands. “We should not make our tax rules a playground for …. tax abusers who pay little or nothing while others pay more than their share.”

The Pandora Papers show that in 2017 Blair and his wife Cherie became the owners of a $8.8 million Victorian building by acquiring the British Virgin Islands company that held the property. The London building now hosts Cherie Blair’s law firm.

The records indicate that Cherie Blair and her husband who served as a diplomat in the Middle East after stepping down as prime minister in 2007 bought the offshore company that owned the building from the family of Bahrain’s industry and tourism minister Zayed bin Rashid al-Zayani.

By purchasing the company shares instead of the building the Blairs benefited from a legal arrangement that saved them from having to pay more than $400000 in property taxes.

The Blairs and the al-Zayanis said they didn’t initially know about each other’s involvement in the deal.

Cherie Blair said that her husband was not involved in the transaction and that its purpose was “bringing the company and the building back into the U.K. tax and regulatory regime.”

She also said that she “did not want to be the owner of a BVI company” and that the “seller for their own purposes only wanted to sell the company.” The company is now closed.

Through their lawyer the al-Zayanis said their companies “have complied with all U.K. laws past and present.”

“These are loopholes that are available to wealthy people but not available to others” Robert Palmer executive director of Tax Justice UK told The Guardian. “Politicians need to fix the tax system so that everyone pays their fair share.”

In June Brazil’s economics minister Paulo Guedes proposed a tax reform package that included a 30% tax on profits earned through offshore entities. Experts estimate that Brazil’s richest people hold almost $200 billion in untaxed funds outside the country.

“You cannot be ashamed of being rich” Guedes said. “You have to be ashamed of not paying taxes.”

After bankers and business leaders objected to tax hikes in the legislation Guedes a millionaire former banker agreed to remove the proposed tax on offshore profits. Negotiations over the legislation are continuing.

The Pandora Papers reveal that Guedes created Dreadnoughts International Group in 2014 in the British Virgin Islands.

In response to questions from an ICIJ partner in Brazil Revista Piauí a spokesperson for Guedes said the minister has disclosed the company to Brazilian authorities. The spokesperson did not answer a question about the removal of the offshore tax from the legislation.

‘Pandora’s box’

In December 2018 the Bahamas enacted legislation requiring companies and certain trusts to declare their real owners to a government registry. The island nation was under pressure from larger countries including the U.S. to do more to block tax dodgers and criminals from the financial system.

Some Bahamian politicians opposed the move. They complained the register would discourage Latin American clients from doing business in the Caribbean. “The winners of these new double standards are the U.S. states of Delaware Alaska and South Dakota” one local attorney said.

Months later a confidential document indicated that the family of the Dominican Republic’s former Vice President Carlos Morales Troncoso had abandoned the Bahamas as a go-to sanctuary for their wealth.

For their new refuge they chose a place 1600 miles away: Sioux Falls South Dakota.

The family set up South Dakota trusts leaked records show to lay away various assets including shares they’d held in a Dominican sugar company. The family did not respond to questions about the assets moved from the Bahamas to South Dakota.

The Pandora Papers provide details about tens of millions of dollars moved from offshore havens in the Caribbean and Europe into South Dakota a sparsely populated American state that has become a major destination for foreign assets.

Over the past decade South Dakota Nevada and more than a dozen other U.S. states have transformed themselves into leaders in the business of peddling financial secrecy. Meanwhile most of the policy and law enforcement efforts of the world’s most powerful nations have stayed focused on “traditional” offshore havens such as the Bahamas the Caymans and other island paradises.

The U.S. is one of the biggest players in the offshore world. It is also the country best situated to bring an end to offshore financial abuses thanks to the outsize role it plays in the international banking system. Because of the U.S. dollar’s status as the de facto global currency most international transactions flow in and out of New York-based banking operations.

U.S. authorities have taken action over the past two decades to force banks in Switzerland and other countries to turn over information about Americans with overseas accounts.

But the U.S. is more interested in forcing other countries to share information about Americans banking offshore than in sharing information about money moving through U.S. bank accounts companies and trusts.

The U.S. has refused to join a 2014 agreement supported by more than 100 jurisdictions including the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg that would require American financial institutions to share information they have about foreigners’ assets.

Year after year in South Dakota state lawmakers have approved legislation drafted by trust industry insiders providing more and more protections and other benefits for trust customers in the U.S. and abroad. Customer assets in South Dakota trusts have more than quadrupled over the past decade to $360 billion.

“As a citizen I’m so sad that my state was the state that opened Pandora’s box” Susan Wismer a former lawmaker told ICIJ.

By 2020 17 of the world’s 20 least-restrictive jurisdictions for trusts were American states according to a study by Israeli academic Adam Hofri-Winogradow. In many cases he said U.S. laws have made it more difficult for creditors to put their hands on what they are owed including child support payments from absent parents.

Using documents from the Pandora Papers ICIJ and The Washington Post identified nearly 30 U.S.-based trusts linked to foreigners personally accused of misconduct or whose companies were accused of wrongdoing.

Among them is Federico Kong Vielman whose family is one of Guatemala’s economic powerhouses.

In 2016 Kong Vielman moved $13.5 million into a trust in Sioux Falls. Some of the money came from his family’s company which makes floor waxes and other products.

Guatemalan media reported for decades on the family’s ties to politics. In the 1970s the family was identified as a key ally of Gen. Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio the former Guatemalan dictator known as the “Jackal of Zacapa.” In 2016 the family’s luxury hotel in Guatemala City made a gift of 100 free nights to then-President Jimmy Morales. Guatemalan media outlets reported that a possible payment for “political favors” was suspected.

In 2014 U.S. labor officials filed a complaint against Guatemala’s government that included allegations that the family’s palm oil company underpaid workers and exposed them to toxic chemicals. Company records show Kong Vielman was previously the company’s treasurer.

A year later U.S. environmental authorities providing technical assistance to Guatemala found that the company released pollutants into the Pasion River. The family company Nacional Agro Industrial SA known as Naisa was not charged.

Naisa told ICIJ that it followed the law and did not pollute the river. The labor complaint was resolved by an arbitration panel the company said.

Kong Vielman declined to respond to questions about the South Dakota trust.

Another wealthy Latin American who set up trusts in South Dakota is Guillermo Lasso a banker who was elected as Ecuador’s president in April. Leaked records show that Lasso moved assets into two trusts in South Dakota in December 2017 three months after Ecuador’s parliament passed a law prohibiting public officials from holding assets in tax havens. The records show that Lasso moved two offshore companies to the South Dakota trusts from two secretive foundations in Panama.

Lasso said that his past use of offshore entities was “legal and legitimate.” Lasso said he complies with Ecuadorian law.

Trusts set up in South Dakota and many other U.S. states remain cloaked in secrecy despite enactment this year of the federal Corporate Transparency Act which makes it harder for owners of certain types of companies to hide their identities.

The law is not expected to apply to trusts popular with non-U.S. citizens. Another glaring exemption financial crime experts say is that many lawyers who set up trusts and shell companies have no obligations to examine the sources of their clients’ wealth.

“Clearly the U.S. is a big big loophole in the world” said Yehuda Shaffer former head of the Israeli financial intelligence unit. “The U.S. is criticizing all the rest of the world but in their own backyard this is a very very serious issue.”

‘Extraordinary expenses’

Billionaire Erman Ilicak’s construction empire had a big year in 2014.

The Turkish mogul’s company Rönesans Holding finished building a 1150-room presidential palace for his country’s pugnacious leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan amid media rumblings about cost overruns and corruption and a court order attempting to stop the project.

Another notable event involving the Ilicak family took place in 2014 this time out of the public glare. The corporate titan’s 74-year-old mother Ayse Ilicak became the owner of two offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands according to the Pandora Papers.

Both companies were fronted by nominee directors and nominee shareholders. One of the companies Covar Trading Ltd. held assets from the family’s construction conglomerate the records say. During its first full year in operation Covar Trading earned $105.5 million in income from dividends according to confidential financial statements. The money was stashed in a Swiss account.

It didn’t stay long.

That same year the statements show the company paid almost the entire $105.5 million as a “donation” listed under “extraordinary expenses.” The statements do not describe who or what received the money.

Illiack did not reply to questions for this story.

Ilicak and the other billionaires in the Pandora Papers come from 45 countries with the largest number from Russia (52) Brazil (15) the U.K. (13) and Israel (10).

The American billionaires mentioned in the secret documents include two tech moguls Robert F. Smith and Robert T. Brockman whose trusts have been the targets of investigations by U.S. authorities. Both were clients of CILTrust an offshore provider in Belize operated by Glenn Godfrey a former attorney general of Belize.

Smith agreed last year to pay U.S. authorities $139 million to settle a tax probe and is cooperating with prosecutors. A U.S. grand jury indicted Brockman Smith’s mentor and financial backer in what prosecutors called the biggest tax fraud in U.S. history.

Smith declined to comment. Brockman has pleaded not guilty.

Neither CILTrust nor Godfrey have been accused of wrongdoing. Godfrey did not respond to requests for comment.

A law firm in Cyprus Nicos Chr. Anastasiades and Partners appears in the Pandora Papers as a key offshore go-between for wealthy Russians. The firm retains the name of its founder Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades and the president’s two daughters are partners there.

The records show that in 2015 a compliance manager at the Panama law firm Alcogal found that the Cypriot law firm helped a Russian billionaire and former senator Leonid Lebedev conceal ownership of four companies by listing law firm employees as owners of Lebedev’s entities.

Lebedev – an oil tycoon and movie producer with Hollywood connections – fled Russia in 2016 after authorities accused him of embezzling $220 million from an energy company. Lebedev did not respond to requests for comment. The status of the Russian case is unclear.

The Cypriot law firm also prepared reference letters for Russian steel magnate Alexander Abramov including one drafted days after the U.S. added the billionaire’s name to the list of oligarchs close to President Putin. Abramov didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Theophanis Philippou the law firm’s managing director told the BBC an ICIJ partner that it has never misled authorities or concealed the identity of a company owner. He declined to comment on clients citing attorney-client confidentiality.

Another Russian in the Pandora Papers who has ties to Putin is Konstantin Ernst a television executive and Oscar-nominated producer. He has been called Putin’s top image-maker a creative talent who sold the nation on the idea that the president is “Russia’s strong-willed savior.”

The Pandora Papers reveal that Ernst was given a chance to participate in a lucrative opportunity soon after producing the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics at Sochi creating a spectacle that boosted Putin’s reputation inside and outside the country.

Ernst became a silent partner hidden behind layers of offshore companies in a state-funded privatization contract – a deal to buy dozens of movie theaters and other property from the city of Moscow.

The leaked records show that by 2019 the value of Ernst’s personal stake in the property holdings topped $140 million.

Ernst told ICIJ that he has “never made a secret” of his involvement in the privatization deal and that the deal was not compensation for his work during the 2014 Olympics.

“I haven’t committed any illegal actions” he said. “Nor am I committing any now or about to. This is how my parents raised me.”

‘Our way of life’

As a human rights and anti-poverty activist Mae Buenaventura joined the fight to secure the return of billions of dollars the late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos his family and cronies concealed in Swiss accounts and other hard-to-trace locations.

Many in her home country Buenaventura said “know that the wealthy have ways and means to accumulate riches and also hide them in a way that ordinary people cannot get their hands on.”

The Marcos scandal also educated the world encouraging stepped-up efforts to discover illicit money and punish the people who hide it.

Over the last 20 years political leaders have vowed to “eradicate” tax havens. They’ve called shell companies and money laundering “threats to our security our democracy and our way of life.” They’ve passed new laws and inked international agreements.

But the offshore system is nothing if not adaptable and cross-border financial crime and tax dodging continue to thrive.

When an offshore provider or jurisdiction is exposed by a leak or comes under pressure from authorities others use its misfortune as a marketing opportunity snapping up clients fleeing for safer havens.

An ICIJ analysis identified hundreds of offshore companies that ended relationships with the scandal-tarred law firm Mossack Fonseca after the release of the Panama Papers investigation. Other providers took over as the companies’ offshore agents.

Leak to us

One of those companies was controlled by an offshore trust whose beneficiaries included the wife of Jacob Rees-Mogg a member of the British Conservative Party and current leader of the House of Commons.

The Pandora Papers indicate that a holding company and a trust benefiting his spouse Helena de Chair owned “pictures and paintings” worth $3.5 million.

Another company that moved away from Mossack Fonseca was a BVI entity controlled by the widow and two sons of Indian underworld figure Iqbal Memon. Memon has been identified in news reports as a major drug dealer with links to terrorists. His widow and sons are accused of laundering drug money and have been wanted since 2019 by authorities in New Delhi.

In the Philippines money being moved around in the shadows continues to be a problem despite the attention given to Marcos’ offshore loot. In recent years the U.S. has labeled the Philippines as a “major money laundering jurisdiction.”

Philippine political figures in the Pandora Papers include Juan Andres Donato Bautista. He served from 2010 to 2015 as the chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government – the panel established to track down Marcos’ billions.

A month after he was appointed to lead the commission Bautista created a shell company in the British Virgin Island that held a bank account in Singapore secret records show.

Bautista was later tapped to head the country’s election agency but lawmakers impeached him in 2017 after his wife claimed he’d hoarded millions of dollars in undeclared domestic and foreign accounts.

In a phone call and emails to ICIJ Bautista said he created his BVI company on the advice of bankers. The bank account was opened before he joined the government he said adding that it never received significant deposits and that he disclosed his interests to authorities. He denied wrongdoing and said there are no formal charges against him.

Despite failures by the Philippines and other nations to curb the flow of covert money Buenaventura and other reform advocates say there are reasons for hope.

Street protesters helped topple top leaders in Iceland and Pakistan after the Panama Papers. The Philippines has joined dozens of countries that now require companies to disclose their real owners. Philippine authorities have recovered roughly $4 billion stolen by Marcos and his circle using it to buy land for landless farmers and to compensate families of people targeted for murder or “enforced disappearance” by the Marcos regime.

Many obstacles remain. Big banks law firms and other powerful groups often oppose stronger transparency rules and tougher enforcement against offshore abuses. And in the Philippines and many other countries anti-corruption activists endure legal threats arrests and violence.

Last month police fired water cannons at protesters who marked the 49th anniversary of Marcos’ declaration of martial law by drawing attention to similarities with current President Rodrigo Duterte’s rule.

Buenaventura said she and other grass-roots activists will keep working to expose wealth that’s “deeply hidden.”

“Our slogan is: The truth will come out.”

About this project

Dear Reader

Today The Washington Post is joining news organizations around the globe to bring you the first in a series of important stories. These are the product of nearly a year of reporting at The Post focused on a vast trove of documents that expose a secretive financial universe that benefits the wealthy and powerful.

The project known as the Pandora Papers was conceived and organized by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists which obtained the records and shared them with The Post and other partners. The documents — more than 11.9 million records from 14 offshore entities including law and wealth-management firms — illuminate a hidden world that has allowed government leaders a monarch billionaires and criminals to shield their assets.

The Post decided to join this project because we felt certain that the breadth of records obtained by the ICIJ would shine a light on aspects of the international financial system that have operated with little or no oversight. A similar but narrower ICIJ investigation known as the Panama Papers and published in 2016 revealed hidden wealth that ignited protests in several countries forcing two world leaders from power.

The sheer scope of the records was too large for effective review by any single news organization. The partnership with the ICIJ allowed The Post the BBC the Guardian PBS Frontline and others to work together in scouring the documents validating the material and conducting the additional reporting needed to place key findings in context.

In closely examining thousands of documents over many months The Post and its partners have found no indication of inaccuracy or that the papers’ release was targeted at any specific individual or government.

We have sought to provide every person and company identified in stories with the opportunity to review and comment on our findings. No one has challenged the authenticity of the documents. We are confident that our reporting meets The Post’s standards for accuracy and fairness. To minimize unnecessary harm to individuals and institutions we have removed account numbers metadata and other identifying information from documents before they are published.

The Post is proud to have taken part in reporting that has brought the Pandora Papers to light.

More than 330 politicians from 90 countries 35 current or former heads of state (14 in Latin America alone) 133 Forbes billionaires whose combined fortunes exceed €500 billion and 46 Russian oligarchs. This is just the tip of the iceberg from an investigation that has been analyzing nearly 12 million documents from a total of 14 offshore service providers in opaque jurisdictions. The Pandora Papers reveal new information and prove that the offshore sector remains in rude health despite the Great Recession and the toll that the most recent crises have caused to Western welfare states which have been decimated by a series of law firms that are specialized in taking advantage of the opacity of tax havens the world over.

Their clients could sell shares in a mining company as the family of Chilean President Sebastián Piñera did or get paid for consulting work from disreputable companies without paying tax as is the case of former International Monetary Fund (IMF) director Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Another option was to use the British Virgin Islands to set up a real estate empire on Miami’s Indian Creek Island aka the “Billionaire Bunker” as Spanish crooner Julio Iglesias has done or try to hide an account in Andorra like soccer manager Pep Guardiola did.

More information What are the Pandora Papers? Ten key points to explain the investigation into tax havens

Over the course of two years more than 600 reporters from 117 countries have worked on the Pandora Papers an international journalistic investigation coordinated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and set up to analyze 11.9 million internal files from 14 offshore service providers such as Alemán Cordero Galindo & Lee (Alcogal) Trident Trust and Asiaciti all specialized in opening companies in opaque jurisdictions. Prior to the investigation the names of some of these firms were already under the scrutiny of several national tax authorities for their role in fomenting tax fraud and money laundering schemes around the world. The corporate tangle that according to the Spanish Treasury was used by Shakira to avoid paying €14.5 million in taxes and the companies that are at the root of Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti’s problems with the taxman are among the 29700 offshore companies exposed by this data leak.

Five decades of records between the 1970s and 2020 have made it possible to reconstruct the financial dealings of politicians billionaires criminals and elite athletes in countries and territories that afford anonymity and low tax rates to foreign capital.

In Spain a team from EL PAÍS and La Sexta TV network has analyzed the leak to flag up Spaniards in the public eye who have taken advantage of the most opaque jurisdictions in the world. The data throws up 601 people with Spanish nationality and 751 offshore companies linked to either individuals or companies with addresses in Spanish territory. In addition to dozens of public personalities there are at least 54 linked to ongoing court cases. In most instances they have used Andorran and Spanish lawyers as intermediaries to create opaque corporate vehicles in the most secretive tax havens in the world including Belize the British Virgin Islands the Bahamas and the Cook Islands.

Using an offshore company is legal as long as the owner declares it to the tax authorities in the country where they reside. These companies benefit from low taxation anonymity and the absence of records of the accounts or the real owners in the jurisdictions where they are registered and have no real activity.

In the eyes of the authorities the problem is what is being hidden behind them. According to an estimate by the European Commission EU citizens alone divert the equivalent of 10% of Europe’s gross domestic product (GDP) through these corporate vehicles amounting to €46 billion a year in lost revenue – that’s eight times the annual budget of the Education Ministry in Spain. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates that at least €9.7 trillion is stashed offshore worldwide.

As Christoph Trautvetter a tax expert who has advised both governments and multinationals explains “the laws that allow it are not democratically approved laws but created under the influence of an industry of lawyers and service providers who benefit from the secrecy of countries where they operate and where it is legal.” The actions of that industry are reflected in the Pandora Papers documents. The Alcogal firm helped banks around the world create at least 3926 offshore companies for their clients in various countries. In the case of financial services giant Morgan Stanley it set up another 312. Based in Panama Alcogal sent more than 5400 letters to the specific addresses of lawyers around the world containing corporate documents: the country that received the most letters was Andorra which with 2245 pieces of correspondence had more than half the total.

Law firms: the key to accessing the offshore world

The offshore service providers at the center of this investigation represent the main cog in the machinery that moves money outside conventional circuits. According to Spanish tax inspector José María Pealáez “they are essential intermediaries for tax havens to function: without them and the banks it would be unthinkable to take money to the Bahamas and the Virgin Islands.” Without them it would not be so easy to hide assets such as those unearthed in the Pandora Papers: bank accounts private jets yachts mansions and works of art by Picasso or Banksy.

The Alcogal firm is where most references to Spanish and Latin American citizens can be found. Based in Panama it contains at least 253 companies linked to Spain either because the client themselves or their intermediary is Spanish – that is the firm that is in contact with Alcogal. Among its top-level clients are the ruler of Jordan King Abdullah II and the prime minister of the Czech Republic Andrej Babiš. In the case of the Jordanian King the investigation has identified a link between him and more than 30 companies; in the case of the Czech premier it has revealed a trust he set up to pay $20 million (€17.2 million) for a villa in a French village near Cannes. There are also a number of Spaniards whom EL PAÍS and La Sexta will be putting under the spotlight in the coming days.

Alcogal’s internal files also afford an insight into the lack of control that this kind of firm has over the companies it helps set up. Between 2007 and 2018 its employees filled out 109 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs). These are reports that law firms have to submit to a country’s authorities when they detect something unusual or something that suggests illegal activity. Seventy-four of these reports were made because the offshore company or its client was involved in a high-profile judicial investigation. Two out of three reports (72) were completed after the 2016 publication of the Panama Papers a similar leak of documents that shed light on the illicit activities of thousands of companies previously unknown to the public.

Among other cases to be published by EL PAÍS this new investigation has uncovered the ghost company that the Neapolitan Camorra mafia boss Raffaele Amato used to buy land in Spain. It has also revealed details about the network of companies that the Malaysian financier Jho Low created with the help of leading US law firm Baker McKenzie for the embezzlement of more than $4.5 billion (€3.89 billion) from a Malaysian economic development fund.

But the entity the Pandora Papers has most information on is Trident Trust a service provider that opened its first offices in the Channel Islands in 1978. Its name recently became familiar to Spaniards when the Madrid public prosecutor accused Real Madrid soccer club coach Carlo Ancelotti of failing to pay just over €1 million in taxes in 2014. The two companies through which the Italian former soccer player’s image rights abroad were paid were part of a structure set up by Trident employees. Trident also created a family trust for Javier Trias former mayor of Barcelona as exposed in another ICIJ investigation. These types of trusts are particularly opaque because there is usually no public record of their existence and because they add an additional layer of obscurity that conceals the true owner of the company’s assets.

In Latin America the king of these offshore service providers is a company based in Panama called OMC Group which is less well known in Europe. Chilean President Sebastián Piñera and Luis Abinader his counterpart in the Dominican Republic are among its elite clients. The company was also used by the Colombian singer Shakira to set up at least three of her offshore companies firms that the Spanish Tax Agency has been tracking for years.

The fallout from the Panama Papers

Based on the 2016 investigation of internal files belonging to the world’s fourth-biggest offshore law firm Panama-based Mossack Fonseca the Panama Papers represented an inside look at the system of shell companies in tax havens for the first time. The Pandora Papers are now the box that when opened reveals all the evils of that world as was the case in Greek mythology when Pandora the first human woman created on the instructions of Zeus was unable to resist temptation and opened the box entrusted to her. Tax avoidance is no longer about just one rotten apple; it is systemic. In this new leak the investigation involves more political leaders and public figures than the Panama Papers and provides more than twice as much information on the ownership of offshore companies.

The Panama Papers ended up changing the whole concept of tax havens. As if to confirm this a partner of a large tax advisory firm in the center of Madrid says they are now the first to avoid suspicious corporate vehicles. “Nowadays when a client comes to us and says ‘I have a trust a foundation a company that is offshore’ we tell them to regularize that structure before there are problems” he says.

An a priori refusal such as this used to be far less frequent. When in 2012 the Finance Ministry obliged taxpayers with income or assets abroad exceeding €50000 to file an informative declaration €2 out of every €3 of that first batch of declarations entered the Spanish coffers from territories considered tax havens by Spain or the European Union.

It was after the Panama Papers scandal that Panama agreed to sign the protocols that allow tax authorities in the rest of the world access to its tax and corporate data. “They were singled out at an international level to embrace the automatic exchange of information” says Alfredo García an expert in tax law at the University of Valencia. “It had already been clear since the financial crisis that secrecy could not be maintained and a window had to be opened onto the public treasuries.” A study on these financial-data-exchange protocols estimates that they have reduced international deposits in tax havens by 11.5%. The Panamanian government itself has explained that as part of its efforts to reduce tax evasion and money laundering it has suspended 385415 of the 762709 companies that figured on its Public Registry.

In the new files it can be seen how in the wake of the Panama Papers Trident Trust incorporated nearly a hundred clients who opted to transfer their companies from Mossack Fonseca to this new supplier. In a statement Trident added that “the numbers ultimately accepted by Trident represented less than 5% of the Mossack Fonseca book of registered office and registered agent (’RORA’) business in the BVI.”

A year after the publication of this information Spain’s financial intelligence unit Sepblac was able to access information on 209 Panama companies that had been kept under lock and key until then including those that allowed the diversion of public funds in the Defex case when the Spanish state-owned firm was hauled up over bribery for arms contracts. The Spanish tax authorities were able to recover at least €140 million after opening inspections on 244 taxpayers; worldwide at least €1.2 billion was recovered. In all of these cases companies that were not in fact illegal in principle were used. As former US president Barack Obama noted in 2016 when calling world leaders to action in the wake of the Panama Papers “That’s the problem – a lot of this stuff is legal.”

The version of the providers The service providers that have been contacted as part of this investigation all agree on their main message: a commitment to the laws of the country in which they operate. That was the statement from Alcogal which was very similar to that sent by Trident Trust which also underlined that ""Trident routinely cooperates with any competent authority which requests information"". OMC meanwhile points to its “robust” program of compliance with the laws which includes due diligence policies and procedures. And Asiaciti which says it has similar processes admits that there is a margin for error. “No compliance program is foolproof” the company says. “When we identify a problem we take the measures necessary for our relationship with the client and we notify the regulatory agencies.”

Errata In an earlier version of the article two statements by Trident were not reported correctly. They have now been added to reflect Trident‘s position on the matter.

Masked police broke up the demonstrations and jailed critics of the country’s leaders.

Still the people chanted for change.

Finally in a bid to defuse the crisis Jordanian authorities in June 2020 trumpeted a crackdown on hidden wealth designed to help stanch the flow of an estimated $800 million a year out of the country.

Then-Prime Minister Omar al-Razzaz said the crackdown was especially needed to respond to COVID-19’s impact on the state’s finances. Jordan would track every last dinar that citizens had hidden in tax havens the prime minister said; No offshore wealth was beyond scrutiny.

None it seems except the king’s.

A trove of leaked documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists shows that the country’s long-ruling monarch King Abdullah II has secretly owned 14 luxury homes in the United Kingdom and the United States purchased between 2003 and 2017 through front companies registered in tax havens. Their value totals more than $106 million.

The homes include a house in Ascot one of England’s most expensive towns; multimillion-dollar apartments in central London and three luxury apartments in a complex in Washington D.C. with panoramic views of the Potomac River.

Also included are three adjoining beachfront homes under reconstruction at Point Dume a posh enclave near Los Angeles. One a seven-bedroom mansion on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean was bought in 2014 through one of the king’s shell companies Nabisco Holdings (no connection to the cookie company) for $33.5 million.

Advisers to the 59-year-old monarch who awards an annual prize for transparency in his name spared no effort to conceal his real estate holdings the records show. Accountants and lawyers in Switzerland and the British Virgin Islands formed shell companies on the king’s behalf and concocted plans to shield his name from public and even confidential government registries.

On two documents BVI corporate administrators at the firm Alemán Cordero Galindo & Lee better known as Alcogal checked boxes to declare that no one connected to one of the king’s companies was involved in politics – even though the king has the power to appoint governments dissolve Parliament and approve legislation.

Writing to ICIJ on the king’s behalf attorneys denied anything improper about owning homes through offshore companies. The king is not required to pay taxes under Jordanian law the attorneys said.

Experts familiar with the region say the timing of the purchases if made public would likely have alienated many Jordanians and the tribal leaders who help keep Abdullah in power. Most of the U.S. and U.K. real estate deals – and six of those for more than $5 million – took place since 2011 after Arab Spring protests that toppled governments in Egypt Libya and Tunisia and posed the first serious threat to the Jordanian monarchy in generations.

Jordan is one of the poorest countries in the region. It has almost no oil of its own and precious little water. The kingdom depends on foreign aid to support its own people and to house and care for millions of refugees. Last year alone the United States gave Jordan more than $1.5 billion in aid and military funding and the European Union agreed to provide the kingdom with more than $218 million to soften the blow of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Jordan doesn’t have the kind of money that other Middle Eastern monarchies like Saudi Arabia have to allow a king to flaunt his wealth” Dr. Annelle Sheline an expert on religious and political authority in the Middle East said in an interview with ICIJ. Sheline a research fellow with the Quincy Institute in Washington D.C. added “If the Jordanian monarch were to display his wealth more publicly it wouldn’t only antagonize his people it would piss off Western donors who have given him money.”

Experts say Abdullah whose subjects mock the way he speaks Arabic with an English accent has little room for error.

This year Jordanian police detained 16 people including a member of the royal family over an alleged plot to oust Abdullah. Prince Hamzah the king’s younger half brother was temporarily placed under house arrest for his alleged role in the coup attempt. In a furtive video issued after a visit from the country’s intelligence services Hamzah denied being part of any conspiracy.

“I am not the person responsible for the breakdown in governance for the corruption and for the incompetence that has been prevalent in our governing structure for the last 15 to 20 years and has been getting worse by the year” Prince Hamzah said. “A ruling system has decided that its personal interests that its financial interests that its corruption is more important than the lives and dignity and futures of the 10 million people that live here.”

Jordanian officials accused Hamzah of a conspiracy that threatened national security. Hamzah did not accuse Abdullah of wrongdoing.

U.K. attorneys for the king said Abdullah has crucial legitimate security and privacy reasons for holding property in offshore corporations that have nothing to do with tax evasion or any other improper purpose. The king has never misused public monies or foreign aid the attorneys wrote adding Abdullah’s wealth comes from personal sources. Abdullah cares deeply for Jordan and its people and acts with integrity and in the best interests of his country and its citizens at all times the attorneys said.

The attorneys said that most of the offshore companies either no longer exist or are not related to the king and that some of the properties identified by ICIJ as belonging to him did not. Attorneys declined to explain what the king considers inaccurate due to alleged privacy and security concerns for him and his family.

All the king’s (offshore) men

Abdullah has long cultivated an image as a moderate and modernizing figure. A motorbike-riding peace-prize-winning sovereign Abdullah was educated at the United Kingdom’s Royal Military Academy and the University of Oxford among other institutions. He assumed the crown in 1999 upon the death of his father Hussein. The king and his Kuwaiti-born Palestinian wife Rania are often described as the Middle East’s most “modern” ruling pair; they met at a dinner party in Amman Jordan’s capital city when the future queen and Instagram influencer was working for Apple.

Bordered by war-torn Syria and Iraq to the north and east and the Israeli-occupied West Bank to the west Abdullah’s Jordan is viewed – at least from the outside – as an island of relative stability. The country of 10 million people is an important U.S. ally and hosted allied military bases during the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Jordan receives billions of dollars each year in aid from the U.S. the European Union and other nations much of it destined for the millions of Palestinian and Syrian refugees in Jordanian camps.

Pro-democracy demonstrations in Jordan have tended to be more peaceful and smaller than those in Tunisia and Egypt during the 2011 Arab Spring. But a stagnant economy and large numbers of refugees have fueled discontent.

In 2012 the year the king bought one of his high-end Washington properties thousands of his subjects swarmed the streets of cities and towns across Jordan to protest the removal of a fuel subsidy – a decision that many Jordanians feared would plunge them into poverty. They danced and sang rhymes. They compared Abdullah to Ali Baba the poor man in “The Thousand and One Nights” (or “The Arabian Nights”) who became rich by intoning “Open sesame” and then looting the 40 thieves’ cave full of gold and gems.

For the first time protesters directed their ire at King Abdullah himself.

People chanted in the streets: “Oh Abdullah son of Hussien where did the people’s money go?

There are those stealing millions and the rest eating plain bread.”

The Pandora Papers investigation reveals that Abdullah has owned at least 36 front companies in secretive tax havens.

Email exchanges found among the leaked files show that for Abdullah’s financial advisers concealing the king’s links to the companies and the properties they acquired was Job One.

One of the the king’s guides into the offshore world was Victoria Loraine a British lawyer living on the shores of Lake Geneva who owned a Swiss wealth-management company Sansa Suisse SA. Sansa Suisse helped Abdullah form one of his earliest shell companies Guinevere Enterprises Ltd. created in 1995 in the British Virgin Islands according to records which don’t say what it was for.

Another guide was Loraine’s business partner Andrew Evans a British accountant. Evans spent more than two decades with the branch office of accounting giant PwC in the United Arab Emirates according to his LinkedIn profile before launching two wealth-management firms in Switzerland Khalij Fiduciaire SA and FidiGere SA. Loraine and Evans were president and secretary respectively of Khalij Fiduciaire SA according to Swiss company records.

Through his companies Evans acted as one of the king’s primary wealth managers and keeper of records according to correspondence between him and Alcogal.

Names of a few of the king’s offshore companies appear to have geographic or religious references: Quba Ltd. to one of Islam’s oldest mosques and Zayer Ltd. to a word for tourists who visit holy places.

While the leaked documents don’t list the king’s individual properties their location details and value can be found by matching shell company names to public property records. Reporters identified 12 of the king’s companies as owners of real estate including a $6.5 million condominium in Washington’s chic Georgetown neighborhood purchased in 2012 by Zayer Ltd. In 2016 the king’s son Crown Prince Hussein graduated with a diploma in international history from Georgetown University a 10 minute walk from the luxury apartments.

The documents don’t reveal the exact purpose or assets of other shell companies owned by the king. Some are described as owning unspecified investments in the U.S. and Europe.

Two of the king’s three Malibu mansions are undergoing major changes according to California planning records. One will be demolished and rebuilt at twice the size. The other on a lot next to a state beach will soon have a new swimming pool a steel pergola and an imposing outdoor barbecue.

On a recent visit by reporters the houses appeared empty. “Building a garage for the owner” one workman on a break shouted over the fence as six of them sat inside the wooden shell of a future carport.

To the sound of weed wackers and barking sea lions surfers in wetsuits walked past the king’s western-most home on their way to Big Dume Beach. “This is an amazing street” said one neighbor on a morning walk.

‘You know who’

Alcogal’s office took charge of the king’s affairs in Panama and the British Virgin Islands from as early as 2007 according to records. It was a natural choice for a sovereign seeking secrecy.

A cluster of more than 50 Caribbean islands and cays east of Puerto Rico the BVI has grown rich thanks to its financial sector. Creating and administering hundreds of thousands of shell companies for foreigners employs huddles of lawyers accountants and others. Strict privacy laws and a top-down commitment to the offshore industry draw not only celebrities and politicians but also criminals.

Since the 1990s Alcogal’s BVI office has helped customers create and operate front companies according to ICIJ’s analysis of the law firm’s records. Founded by the son of a Panamanian ambassador to the U.S. and other elite lawyers Alcogal has become a leading provider of offshore and legal services for multinationals and global elites of all stripes.

Alcogal employees and Evans Abdullah’s adviser understood the importance of discretion. Alcogal employees referred to the king as a “final beneficiary” living in Jordan. Evans preferred “you know who.”

The laws of the BVI and many other jurisdictions including the U.S. require professional services firms like Alcogal to identify the possibility of money-laundering and other violations by their customers. Politicians and government officials are deemed “politically exposed” and especially susceptible to bribery and related crimes. BVI law provides for fines of up to $75000 for each failure to identify or disclose such risks.

Yet in February 2017 Alcogal checked “NO” next to a question on an internal Alcogal risk-assessment document that asked if anyone connected to any of the king’s companies was a politically exposed person in other words a politician or related to one. The same document listed the king’s full name date of birth and his residence as Amman’s sprawling marble-floored Raghadan Palace.

Evans went to great lengths to ensure the king’s ownership of the front companies remained a secret.

In a 2016 draft business agreement with Alcogal Evans’s FidiGere questioned when where and to whom the sovereign’s name and offshore activities would be disclosed according to a review of tracked changes and comments on the document.

As written by Alcogal the agreement required the offshore firm to share information about the king’s ownership with BVI authorities in the event that foreign countries requested such information as part of criminal investigations. Evans demurred wanting to know exactly who in the BVI could be told the whole truth: “Please would you define who is covered by the ‘authorities’” he asked.

Evans modified the agreement to require that Alcogal further shield his “unusually sensitive clients.” According to his modification Alcogal must store information received about such clients in hard-copy form only making it less vulnerable to data leaks or human error and provide access “only on a need-to-know basis.” The leaked documents do not say whether Alcogal accepted the modifications; the law firm continued to work with Evans and FidiGere after the agreement was discussed.

“Currently we only have one client who fits this category” of unusually sensitive clients Evans wrote in the 2016 draft document. While he did not name the king or his companies directly other documents sent around the same time mention Abdullah.

Evans was particularly worried about what could happen to the king’s passport. Evans agreed to provide Alcogal with an electronic copy but asked the firm to restrict access and secure it with a password. Alcogal complied.

With document-handling issues resolved Alcogal and Evans confronted a thorny question: whether to declare to BVI authorities that the companies’ owner was the king of Jordan.

The BVI stepped up disclosure requirements in the wake of bombshell exposés of offshore secrecy including ICIJ’s 2016 Panama Papers investigation. Under new laws firms that help clients create BVI companies must provide authorities with the names of the actual owners – known as “ultimate beneficial owners.” The information is recorded on a confidential BVI government registry. Under BVI law Alcogal must record such information even for companies that are later transferred to other tax havens like Panama as were a number of the king’s.

According to the leaked documents Evans in emails asked Alcogal to list on the confidential register one of Evans’ firms — Khalij Fiduciaire or FidiGere – instead of the king.

Alcogal’s compliance officer in the BVI found that recording one of Evans’ companies as the beneficial owner of the king’s shell businesses was possible according to an email from 2017. But the compliance officer also declared that doing so flouted at least the spirit of the new law which sought to clean up the island’s reputation as a haven for dirty money. The law also required Alcogal to provide ownership information “without delay” the compliance officer wrote and listing Khalij or FidiGere “does not facilitate the ‘without delay’ part” of the law.

Hakim Creque an attorney at prominent BVI law firm Martin Kenney & Co. told ICIJ that a sovereign acting in a personal capacity “should be reported as the beneficial owner.”

Alcogal’s files do not record the final decision. In a response to ICIJ Alcogal declined to comment on individual cases but said it accurately recorded BVI company owners in line with applicable law. The firm said that it conducts enhanced background checks on all politically-connected individuals. Due diligence laws have changed over time in countries where Alcogal operates it said.

Evans told ICIJ media partner in Switzerland online and print publisher Tamedia and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that he is retired and no longer works for the king. He did not answer questions. The king’s attorneys told ICIJ that professionals manage the king’s companies to ensure compliance with relevant legal and financial obligations.

In 2018 after the email exchange Abdullah was still grappling with the anti-tax protests that had gripped the country where the median yearly salary is $7620. After appointing al-Razzaz as Jordan’s new prime minister the king held a public meeting with palace-approved newspaper editors and journalists.

At his annual State of the Nation address last fall President Uhuru Kenyatta mounted the podium at Kenya’s Parliament to acknowledge that too many Kenyans live in poverty and too many officials loot the country’s public resources.

The son of Kenya’s first president and leader of one of Africa’s largest economies the 59-year-old Kenyatta urged lawmakers to join him in fighting corruption and yet again declared “the centrality of transparency accountability and good governance as the anchors of sustainable development.”

But a massive cache of newly leaked documents show that Kenyatta’s family has for years been secretly accumulating a personal fortune behind offshore corporate veils.

Kenyatta along with his mother sisters and brother have for decades shielded wealth from public scrutiny through foundations and companies in tax havens including Panama with assets worth more than $30 million according to records obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and shared with more than 600 reporters and media organizations around the world.

The records – from the Panamanian law firm Aleman Cordero Galindo & Lee (Alcogal) – show that the family owned at least seven such entities two registered anonymously in Panama and five in the British Virgin Islands. One BVI company owned a home in central London according to the records and two other companies held investment portfolios worth tens of millions of dollars. The Kenyattas’ offshore wealth revealed here for the first time represents part of an estimated half-billion-dollar family fortune amassed in a country where the average annual salary is less than $8000 a year.

The family began to accumulate much of its offshore wealth while Uhuru Kenyatta was a rising political star. Two offshore companies were created during an investigation into alleged looting of the public treasury during the watch of President Daniel arap Moi Kenyatta’s former political patron.

Under Kenyan law the president must provide a list of financial interests to the Ministry of Finance each year. Kenyatta and his family members did not respond to requests for comment including whether he declared any offshore interests or was required to do so.

Details of the Kenyatta family’s offshore wealth have been brought to light by the Pandora Papers a collection of more than 11.9 million records from 14 law firms and other service providers based in the United Arab Emirates the Seychelles Panama Singapore and other tax havens.

The investigation has revealed assets of 35 current or former world leaders including the king of Jordan the prime minister of the Czech Republic and Kenyatta’s fellow African leaders Ali Bongo Ondimba of Gabon and Denis Sassou-Nguesso of the Republic of Congo.

The discovery that Kenyatta and his family owned Panamanian foundations and a string of shell companies provides a jarring contrast to Kenyatta’s projected image as a transparency advocate. Documents show that the expansion of the Kenyattas’ offshore holdings coincided with Uhuru Kenyatta’s political rise with increasing the layers of secrecy to shield the family’s wealth from scrutiny even as Uhuru solidified his role as a man of the people.

The ‘burning spear’

The story of the Kenyatta family fortune with its various companies and foundations in tax havens begins with an ambitious tribal scion who would become one of post-colonial Africa’s most iconic leaders: Jomo Kenyatta.

Uhuru Kenyatta’s father was born Kamau Ngengi circa 1894 in the fertile Central Highlands of what was then known as British East Africa. Kamau’s father was a village chief in the powerful Kikuyu tribe in a country where tribal affiliation often determines the outcome of elections. Educated at a Christian mission school the young Kamau signaled his ambitions by taking the name Jomo Kenyatta a local word for “burning spear.”

At the start of the 20th century a British colonial government tightened its grip on the region’s non-white population. A “hut tax” was imposed on people with little or no money many of whom depended on their crops and livestock for survival. Some were driven to prostitution or consigned to forced labor.

Like many of his contemporaries Jomo Kenyatta rebelled.

“Nothing is more important than a correct grasp of the question of land tenure” Kenyatta wrote in 1938 while attending university in London. “For it is the key to the people’s life.”

Jomo Kenyatta returned home to lead a pro-independence party and was quickly imprisoned by the British on unfounded and politically motivated charges that he led the nationwide rebellion then underway. When he left prison nearly nine years later Jomo took charge of independence negotiations and in 1963 Kenya gained independence with Kenyatta as prime minister. In 1964 he became the country’s first president and he presided over an economic boom that burnished the country’s reputation as a post-colonial model.

But instead of building democracy Kenyatta turned the fledgling nation into a one-party state marked by arbitrary detention torture and political assassination. Promised land reform became a land grab: Kenyans found that property had simply changed hands from European elites to Kenyatta cronies.

A United Nations-backed commission would later find that in two years one-sixth of all properties previously held by Europeans including “vast farms” and valuable coastal real estate were “cheaply sold” to Kenyatta his family and his allies. According to the final 2013 report of Kenya’s Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission beneficiaries included Kenyatta’s fourth and most influential wife Ngina their children including Uhuru and Moi Kenya’s vice president at the time.

“Throughout the years of his administration both land grabbing and irregular land allocations were perpetrated by and for the benefit of the president himself members of his immediate family his relatives and friends” the report declared.

Following Jomo Kenyatta’s death in 1978 in his 80s (his date of birth is unknown) Moi took over as president as a result of complex negotiations designed to head off tribal feuds.

After an attempted 1982 military coup Moi plunged Kenya deeper into authoritarianism and over more than two decades he looted more than $2 billion a government-commissioned investigation would find.

Protected by their ties to Moi and by Jomo Kenyatta’s aura as father of the nation the Kenyattas thrived.

Uhuru’s mother Ngina popularly known as “Mama Ngina” was given 264 acres over decades according to a later government probe which recommended that the landholdings be revoked.

With vast landholdings and backing from international investors the family built a business empire acquiring large stakes in well-known Kenyan enterprises including a media conglomeratea major bank and upscale hotels.

In 1993 the family founded Brookside Dairy which expanded across East Africa and is now Kenya’s largest milk producer. One of Jomo and Ngina’s daughters Kristina Wambui-Pratt became a shareholder in a company that builds housing from polystyrene panels. Another Anna Nyokabi Muthama Kenyatta married a gem-mining magnate and managed the Kenyatta family’s beachfront hotel. A discreet and camera-shy son Muhoho now controls the family’s finances according to local media reports.

But none of Jomo and Ngina Kenyatta’s children rose faster or farther than Uhuru.

Named after the Swahili word for freedom Uhuru played rugby (and socialized with Moi’s eldest son Gideon) at a Nairobi private school. He graduated from Amherst College an elite U.S. liberal arts institution in 1985 and returned home to launch an agricultural business and enter politics. He became the chairman of a local political party in 1997 and Moi named him to lead the country’s tourist board.

Uhuru burnished his everyman bona fides by dancing in public while managing to indulge an equally public taste for expensive watches.

In 2001 Moi appointed Uhuru Kenyatta to a vacant seat in Parliament and a month later to the cabinet. Under increasing internal and international pressure to retire at the end of his second term as required by the Kenyan constitution Moi tapped Kenyatta to run as his successor in the 2002 election betting on the Kenyatta name and tribal connections. But a coalition of reformist opposition parties crushed the Moi-Kenyatta alliance relegating the 41-year-old Kenyatta and his party to the opposition .

The new president Mwai Kibaki ordered a probe of the Moi administration and the insiders who had helped spirit money out of East Africa. He appointed Kroll Inc. – the private investigation firm that had unearthed the financial secrets of Iraq’s Saddam Hussein and Haiti’s Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier among others – to lead the inquiry.

Kenyatta was on the front lines of those who rallied to Moi’s defense.”The government should stop digging into the past” Kenyatta told a rally of Moi supporters in western Kenya’s verdant Rift Valley near Lake Victoria.

But within a year a leaked version of the Kroll report spilled into the headlines with blockbuster allegations: Moi and his inner circle had embezzled as much as $2 billion – more than twice what Kenya was receiving in foreign aid in a year — and stashed hundreds of millions of dollars in bank accounts overseas. The report alleged that Moi and his associates “laundered” and “parked” perhaps $400 million in accounts at Geneva’s Union Bancaire Privée and elsewhere. Kenyatta was not named in the report.

According to the report the looting peaked in late 2003 after the new government took power. “A marked flurry of activity has been reported among ex-President Moi’s family and their close associates to pre-empt any possibility of losing their wealth to the government” Kroll reported.

Moi denied wrongdoing and officials quickly announced that he would face no charges in exchange for a smooth transition of power. But the Kroll investigation’s linking ill-gotten wealth to Switzerland and Panama devastated his political legacy and it raised questions about who else may have benefited from the regime’s looting.

Client 13173

One of the largest private banks in Switzerland Union Bancaire Privée advises some of the world’s wealthiest people on how to manage their money. Its eight-story glass headquarters overlooks Lake Geneva and the nearby Prada Versace and Mont Blanc storefronts.

Like other private banks Union Bancaire Privée often works with law firms in the British Virgin Islands the Seychelles and other secrecy jurisdictions to create register and maintain shell companies – which are without real operations and which list paid stand-ins as corporate officers on official paperwork – and similar entities that help clients conceal their ownership and wealth.

Some “offshore” clients are private citizens seeking to avoid taxes in the country where they live or acquire their wealth. Other clients are politicians and public officials who are called “politically exposed persons” in the trade because their wealth is deemed more likely to stem from bribery or other forms of corruption.

In July 2003 the same month that Kenyatta defended Moi in public records show that a Union Bancaire Privée lawyer Othmane Naïm asked Panama offshore specialists to help register a new foundation to be known as the Varies Foundation. The foundation like a trust was designed to manage and shelter wealth for its beneficiaries.

Draft bylaws also from July 2003 name the foundation’s beneficiaries: Uhuru Kenyatta and his mother. Later records show Union Bancaire Privée helped manage a foundation for Uhuru’s brother Muhoho.

Invoices from Alcogal in Panama to the bank show that the Swiss advisers referred to the Kenyattas with a code: “client 13173.”

As with trusts and foundations offered elsewhere including Belize (also South Dakota and Nevada) Panama foundations can be designed to allow families to transfer wealth from one generation to another tax free. Typically an individual or “founder” transfers assets such as a bank account or real estate to the foundation which becomes the assets’ legal owner.

Panamanian foundations are prized like trusts because those who create them the true owners of the assets are not required to register their names with the Panamanian government. That secret remains with their lawyers. Any breach of confidentiality laws carries a jail sentence of up to six months the same sentence imposed in Panama for certain categories of child abuse.

According to a World Bank study foundations are a common tool to mask dirty money. Ferdinand Marcos autocratic president of the Philippines is alleged to have stolen billions of dollars while he ruled the country from 1966 to 1986 funneling millions through a Panamanian foundation.

Alcogal said that it complies with requirements where it operates and “performs enhanced due diligence on a client who is determined to be a high-risk customer.” It told ICIJ’s media partner Finance Uncovered that it has not provided services to the Kenyattas’ foundations since 2014.The foundations were eligible for suspension under Panamanian law for failing to pay annual taxes Algocal said.

Naim told ICIJ that he could not respond to specific questions but said “we always complied with all applicable legislations and regulations.”

The Pandora Papers reveal the Kenyattas also secretly owned offshore shell companies.

Muhoho Kenyatta owned three registered in the BVI according to records: One had a bank account that held an investment portfolio worth $31.6 million in 2016; another had unspecified investments at a bank in London.

From 1999 to 2004 Ngina Kenyatta and her two daughters held shares in a BVI company Milrun International Ltd. The sisters used the company to buy a London apartment in the upscale Westminster neighborhood according to records.

Similar apartments in the modern brick building now sell for more than $1 million. The apartment was rented until July by an English member of parliament Emma Hardy according to public records. Hardy’s attorney said that she signed an ordinary rental agreement and had never heard of the company involved.

Return to power

Following elections in 2007 a sharply divided Kenya was under another coalition government and with part of the family fortune secreted offshore Uhuru Kenyatta mounted a comeback assuming a new political persona. The populist had become an anti-corruption reformer.

In public Kenyatta vigorously espoused transparency and anti-corruption activists praised him for his fight against graft.

When he ran for president a second time in 2013 he toured the country repeating seven “key pledges” including food water and electricity for all. He also promised security on the nation’s restive border with Somalia and stringent anti-corruption measures including new laws and agencies to probe and punish wrongdoers.

“It is time to get tough on those who seek to use their positions of power for their own personal gain” a coalition of four political parties including Kenyatta’s declared in their coalition manifesto.

That year at the age of 51 and after decades of grooming Uhuru Kenyatta was elected president.

In his first State of the Nation address Kenyatta promised honest government and offered to forgo 20% of his salary.

Meanwhile Forbes magazine in 2011 ranked Kenyatta as Kenya’s richest person and the 26th wealthiest in Africa estimating the family fortune at about half a billion dollars. And Kenyatta as president fought to keep some things secret.

Two months after Uhuru Kenyatta won the 2013 election the same commission that examined corruption as far back as his father’s presidency reported testimony that Jomo Kenyatta had acquired vast tracts of land through illegal means. The commission also found that the elder Kenyatta had “interfered in the investigation” of the assassination of a political rival.

A furious Uhuru Kenyatta demanded a retraction albeit only about land deals that cast suspicion on the origins of the family’s empire. After a heated debate in which several commissioners refused to comply with Kenyatta’s demand the majority retracted references to the deals and issued a revised report.

“Protecting the wealth and economic power of the family today seemed more important to the Kenyatta family than the implication than their father was involved in the cover-up of a murder” Ronald Slye one of the dissenting commissioners recalled in an interview with ICIJ.

As Kenyatta approaches his constitutional two-term limit next year He increasingly has staked his legacy on transparency.

“What we own what we have is open to the public” Kenyatta told the BBC in 2018 referring to his family’s wealth. “If there is an instance where somebody can say that what we have done has not been legitimate – say so.”

He continued: “Every public servant’s assets must be declared publicly so that people can question and ask what is legitimate? If you can’t explain yourself including myself then I have a case to answer. If you want to continue serving you must make it public. Period.”

While Paul George didn't need to state his loyalty again after signing a four-year contract he wanted to reiterate it during training camp.

""I really wanted to continue on growing with these guys"" Paul George said. ""I'm here and I wanna be here long-term. By that it's just continuing and establishing relationships.""

The Clippers have a long-term plan over the next three seasons as they build their new Intuit Dome arena. The arena is scheduled for opening at the start of the 2024-25 season with both Kawhi Leonard and Paul George signing long-term deals. In an ideal world the Clippers would have a championship banner already raised going into that arena. They were closer than they've ever been in franchise history last season and likely would have raised a banner if Kawhi Leonard didn't get injured. Regardless of the bittersweet ending Paul George and the team loved the fight that the Clippers showed.

""I didn't love how we ended but I love how close we got towards the end of the season from last year"" George said. ""Mainly it was I just genuinely wanted to be around my guys.""

There are no expectations for how far the Clippers will go during the 2021-22 NBA season. This team will go wherever Kawhi Leonard and Paul George's health will take them.

The board’s decision comes a day after the National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) directed it to consider Invesco’s request to hold an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to remove Goenka and appoint multiple independent directors.On Friday Zee said its board decided not to hold an EGM because Invesco’s demand suffered from multiple legal infirmities. “The board has arrived at this decision by referring to various non-compliances under multiple laws... after taking into account the interests of all the company’s shareholders.”Zee said the board’s decision was based on the legal advice it received from experts including retired Supreme Court judges. The seven-member board comprises one non-independent director (Goenka) and six independent directors. Since Goenka was an interested party he did not participate in Friday’s board meeting the company said.Zee will submit the board’s reply to the petition filed by Invesco in NCLT which will hear the matter on October 4. Explaining the reasons for rejecting Invesco’s request Zee said the US fund’s proposal to appoint 50% of the company’s board would result in “it effecting a change in control of the company without making an open offer”.However a lawyer said Invesco has sought the appointment of “independent directors” on Zee board and “not their nominee directors” raising doubts whether this would tantamount to change in control. Besides according to Invesco’s governing guidelines the US fund cannot hold more than 20% in any stock which means it cannot make an open offer.Zee further said that its Articles of Association (AoA) does not allow more than 12 directors on the board. Since the proposal to remove Goenka cannot be legally effectuated and the proposal to appoint six independent directors are effected the Zee board would consist of 13 members which would be contrary to its (AoA) it said. Zee also said that the I&B ministry requires that to effect any change in the CEO and the board of a company their permission needs to be taken in advance.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2NhbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3Mvb3R0LXBsYXRmb3Jtcy1zdHJ1Z2dsZS1mb3ItcmV2ZW51ZS1kZXNwaXRlLW1pbGxpb25zLW9mLXN1YnNjcmliZXJzLTEwMzY5NzAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OTT platforms struggle for revenue despite millions of subscribers,As per Statista’s recent research the average revenue per user is likely to be flat in the pay-per-view segment OTT advertising and video downloads.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's Zee Entertainment Enterprises said on Saturday it had filed a petition in court against a notice issued by two institutional investors pushing the media company to call for a meeting of shareholders.

Zee's board on Friday rejected calls from Invesco Developing Markets Fund and OFI Global China Fund LLC for an extraordinary general meeting citing the lack of approvals required from India's capital markets regulator and the federal broadcasting ministry for initiating changes to a company's board.

Invesco and OFI which together own 17.88% of Zee want its chief executive Punit Goenka to be removed and a board revamp.

The two investors filed a petition at India's companies court after Zee last week signed a merger deal with Sony Group Corp's India unit to create the country's largest broadcaster.

Goenka is set to become head of the new venture.

The next hearing for the case is scheduled for Oct. 4.

For several months U.S. Army Soldiers from Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa have trained alongside Kenya Defence Forces to improve Soldier skills while building partner capacity necessary to counter violent extremists and address other security and stability threats in the region.

The U.S. Army Soldiers assigned to C Company 1-102nd Infantry Regiment (Mountain) Task Force Iron Gray CJTF-HOA most recently completed urban rifle marksmanship training with Rangers assigned to the KDF in Manda Bay Kenya Oct. 2 2021.

“The training consisted of zeroing weapons and conducting the urban rifle marksmanship table of fire” said U.S. Army Sgt. Alexander Poling 1st Platoon squad leader who instructed the integrated marksmanship training. “The table of fire consists of advanced marksmanship skills such as quickly engaging a target and walking while shooting targets. The goal of the training is to teach more advanced marksmanship tactics and develop a Soldier’s ability to move and shoot in combat with quick reaction time.”

In August Ranger instructors with the KDF integrated U.S. Army Soldiers from C Co. into their jungle warfare techniques training. The training consisted of jungle survivability movement techniques in jungle terrain how to mitigate wildlife and environmental hazards and the tactics techniques and procedures of violent extremist organizations in the area of operations.

“Over the course of a few days the Kenya Defence Forces Ranger instructors took us into the jungle and taught us tactics on operating in their environment and how to best conduct patrols in this region” Poling said.

In addition to the urban rifle marksmanship and jungle warfare training C Co. Soldiers and KDF conducted non-combat skills training. Soldiers with C Co.’s logistics team conducted wheeled mechanic sustainment training and armorer training while company medics conducted multiple iterations of tactical combat casualty care training and the company’s communication specialist instructed multiple classes on the basics of radio communications. The training was mutually beneficial for U.S. and Kenyan service members alike.

U.S. Army Capt. John Collias company commander said that because the KDF are integrated into the defensive posture of Camp Simba Kenya having a good working relationship with our allies is key to mission success.

“Working with the Kenya Defence Forces on training events like these builds trust and interoperability” Collias said. “Without a strong relationship with the Kenya Defence Forces our mission set would be much more difficult.”

Training with allied partners not only improves the relationship between the U.S. military and KDF but also gives U.S. Soldiers a unique view into the culture of Kenya Collias added. The partnership gives both sets of service members’ opportunities to increase leadership skills by training alongside allied country partners sharing tactics standard operating procedures and cultures.

CJTF-HOA operating from Camp Lemonnier Djibouti builds and strengthens partnerships to contribute to security and stability in East Africa. The task force’s efforts as part of a comprehensive whole-of-government approach aims to increase African partner nations’ capacity to maintain a stable environment with an effective government that provides a degree of economic and social advancement to its citizens.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vZ3VpZGVkLm5ld3MvZW4vZ3VpZGVzL25ldy13b3JsZC1pcm9uLWd1aWRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New World: Finding and Mining Iron and what you need it for,"German English

If you want to increase your mining skill in the MMORPG New World or want to manufacture better weapons tools and equipment you cannot ignore iron. The ore can be mined at the beginning of the game we tell you what you need and where to find iron veins.

How to Identify Iron Ore: Iron ore is easy to find in New World. Look out for black-brownish rocks especially on mountain areas. These can either be larger than you or smaller. Often two to three iron veins are located together in a pile or at a short distance from one another. Always grab the biggest first!

This is how you mine iron ore: To mine iron ore all you need is a pickaxe and mining level 0. With a higher area reputation in the course of the game you can also choose bonuses that give you more raw materials. Your pickaxe itself can also receive bonuses at a higher level to make mining for ores easier.

The ore veins respawn after about 10 to 15 minutes.

This is where you can find iron ore in New World

Basically you can find iron ore in highland areas especially in the launch zones of New World. If you look at your own map you will see some gray areas. These are mountains in the game world near or directly on top of which ores can often be found.

Attention: But ore veins can also appear in the middle of the forest or in the meadow. So always keep your eyes open. There is no particularly good farm spot directly because the ores are heavily farmed especially on full servers.

On the interactive map you can also filter for all possible iron ore spots and go on a farming run ingame.

What do you need iron ore in New World for?

For this you need the ore directly: The iron ore can be melted down directly into iron bars in a melting furnace. You can also use the ore at a forge to make armor kits for city-building project quests.

For this you need iron bars: You can do a lot more with the iron bars that are produced.

Weapons rank 2

Tools rank 2

Heavy armor rank 2

Medium armor rank 2

Light armor rank 2

Steel bars

That is why iron is an important raw material: you will not be able to avoid iron later either. Because even steel with which you then produce rank 3 weapons armor and tools needs iron. And the next step the production of star metal for rank 4 requires steel including iron. So the need of iron run through the entire game.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdncmVjb24uY29tL2d1aWRlcy9iZXN0LXRpbWJlcmJvcm4tbWFwcy1saXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Timberborn Maps: Types Sizes and Layout,"Your beaver city building journey starts with finding the best Timberborn maps. If you've not been caught up with the latest early access trend Timberborn is a lumberpunk city builder where you control a colony of beavers trying to survive increasingly severe droughts. Depending on your preference there are various regions on offer to test your ecosystem engineering skills. These are all of the Timberborn maps including those best for beginners where our Timberborn power guide also may come in handy.

Timberborn Maps: Plains (256 x 256)

Click to enlarge Click to enlarge

The plains is the recommended map for first time players. A large flat and relatively simple map that offers the easiest start available in Timberborn it has a single river that flows into a large lake. The starting location is well stocked with resources and comes with plenty of arable land and a relatively narrow shallow river. This gives you an early boon to agriculture and a few dams along the river can ensure a reliable water supply even in longer droughts. Smart beavers will even dam the river leading out of the lake giving you a permanent body of water to build around.

Timberborn Maps: Canyon (128 x 128)

Click to enlarge Click to enlarge

A medium size map that offers slightly more of a challenge the Canyon features a single river flowing through the bottom of a steep valley. The initial starting area offers a fairly large amount of arable land but the steep canyon sides mean that this map will require a lot of vertical building. A strategic dam at the first waterfall can give you a large reservoir keeping your water supply well stocked and opening plenty of options for terraforming with dynamite or canals.

Timberborn Maps: Diorama (50 x 50)

Click to enlarge Click to enlarge

The smallest map in Timberborn offers a challenge of a different kind - limited space. While you start with easy access to every resource including steel the small map size means that each square is vital. You’ll need careful planning and plenty of vertical building to make use of every inch. The key to this tiny map is using levees to create a large reservoir around the base of the waterfall.

Timberborn Maps: Lakes (258 x 258)

Click to enlarge Click to enlarge

A large map that shows off everything Timberborn has to offer. A river snakes through and splits to form multiple lakes across the map while the starting area has plenty of arable land and is close to a small lake but you’ll need to start multiple districts and expand in order to reach the larger bodies of water. Each lake can be dammed and the variations in terrain in this map present plenty of opportunities for terraforming.

Timberborn Maps: Meander (128 x 128)

Click to enlarge Click to enlarge

A medium map that best suits the steel-hungry Iron Teeth faction and players who like to expand. The starting location has easy access to steel meaning you can make use of Iron Teeth’s unique buildings. Thanks to the large river meandering through the map there is plenty of arable land with nearby steel deposits enabling multiple completely self-sufficient beaver cities. The terrain variation also gives plenty of areas to build some impressive structures.

Timberborn Maps: Mountain Range (196 x 196)

Click to enlarge Click to enlarge

A slightly-bigger-than-medium map that presents a real challenge for more experienced beavers. With a small river cutting through a large mountain range this map offers very little initial arable land. This means that you will be limited on space until you can start some serious terraforming. You will also need to travel a fair distance before you can even begin to start collecting any steel. Some well placed levees around the starting area waterfalls can give you two sizeable reservoirs to farm around but creative building will be needed to make the most of the space on offer.

Timberborn Maps: Terraces (256 x 256)

Click to enlarge Click to enlarge

A large map with a series of plateaus and a single snaking river that flows through the lower parts of the map. A slightly easier version of the mountain range map with a similar level of verticality but way more arable land available. The plateaus do give the perfect opportunity for some seriously impressive builds - picture mega dams connecting plateaus.

Timberborn Maps: Thousand Islands (256 x 256)

Click to enlarge Click to enlarge

A large archipelago that offers one of the most interesting challenges in Timberborn - this map is essentially a large sea with several barely connected islands and features the most water of any map. The Thousand Islands map also features the most impressive drought transformation in the game. The amount of water means that at least during the wet season you’ll have plenty of arable land however you’ll need to get creative with platforms and bridges if you want to claim more islands and expand. The key here is to dam around the deeper sections of water and build your structures on the water with platforms to save space.

Timberborn Maps: Waterfalls (128 x 128)

Click to enlarge

A relatively easy medium size map that offers an interesting mix of terrain with a large impressive waterfall. The starting area has a large amount of flat arable land giving you plenty of space to grow food. While the map has limited terraforming chances the two large waterfalls would make the perfect backdrop for some impressive builds which is perfect for those who want to play a map slightly more interesting than the Plains.

Each map in Timberborn is unique with different sizes and layouts there are plenty of options for players of varying skill levels. If you are just starting out stick to the Plains and Waterfalls - these maps should give you a good feel for the game and help you get the basics down. If you are looking for something more challenging then give Canyon or Terraces a try. For something unique try Thousand Islands or Diorama. If you just want to see everything that Timberborn has to offer in one playthrough then Lakes is your best bet and if you are really looking to flex your beaver skills then give Mountain Range a go."

The Northwest Arkansas Council and allies launched an ad campaign Monday in three cities after a test run in Austin Texas. The campaign wants to draw people who have technical talent or are starting a business -- or both -- to Northwest Arkansas. The effort will continue in Austin and expand into Denver Minneapolis and Seattle.

""It sounds like you're trying to do to us what we did to California"" said Bryan Poppe spokesman for the Austin mayor's office when asked Wednesday about the Northwest Arkansas effort.

The campaign – ""Life Works Here"" – grew out of last year's incentive-based relocation campaign created by the council with the same name. That campaign offered $10000 and a mountain bike to professionals working from home in other parts of the country who moved to Northwest Arkansas.

To date 53 of those professionals received grants -- and 34243 applications were received. Those applications had addresses on them said Frances Webster co-founder and chief executive officer of Walrus. The New York-based advertising agency implemented the next phase of the program along with St. Louis-based public relations agency FleishmanHillard.

The ad agencies used research data showing where top-tier technical talent lives as the top criteria to select the four cities Webster said. The applications for the cash awards and the mountain bikes shed light on where people who are interested in Northwest Arkansas live she said. Every one of those 34243 applications contained an address. That helped with city selection she said.

The campaign received money from the Alice L. Walton Foundation J.B. Hunt Transport Services Simmons Foods Tyson Foods Walmart and the Walton Family Foundation said Nelson Peacock president and chief executive of the Northwest Arkansas Council. The council is coordinating the campaign and announced it Monday.

""It's an expensive proposition"" Peacock said when asked about the effort's cost. He declined to give specifics.

This effort isn't trying to spur growth where there is no demand for it he said.

""We have 10381 jobs we could fill right now"" he said.

The Austin mayor's office had no further comment and the Austin Chamber of Commerce declined comment.

Mention New York City Chicago Los Angeles – or Austin Seattle Denver and Minneapolis – and a definite mental picture springs to mind for most people Webster said. People who have never seen one of those cities still have impressions of each.

Northwest Arkansas isn't so set in the public mind she said.

""The product is amazing but people have to come and see it"" Webster said.

One reason the region lacks a conspicuous national profile is also one of its strengths Webster said. The region is a work in progress. The still-growing aspect is a strong draw among people who inquire about it she said. People considering a move there like the idea of helping to shape the community.

""You can have an impact on what's happening in the region"" she said. And the region has strong leadership working to make sure success doesn't spoil the quality of life she said.

Other cities made mistakes during their periods of rapid growth mistakes Northwest Arkansas wants to avoid Peacock said. Traffic congestion and runaway housing prices for instance are the consequences of growth without careful planning.

Getting a grip on such problems won't be easy but Northwest Arkansas groups such as the council its allies and cities within the region are making a coordinated effort at it according to Webster.

""This will be a model for urban planners for decades to come"" she said of the region's efforts.

The advantages Northwest Arkansas has over other congested urban centers are things the region should want to keep Peacock said.

""We have a cost calculator that compares cities and find a lot of differences in costs where Northwest Arkansas has an advantage"" Peacock said. ""Things like housing prices and cost of living are big components but we're also finding things like the time spent commuting in other cities is an advantage for us.

""The market does not take care of these things on its own"" Peacock said. Regional effort on housing transportation workforce development and quality of life issues like trails and preserving the local environment are all needed he said.

BALANCING ACT

Choosing to live in a bigger more-developed city often requires sacrifices in family considerations Webster said. Northwest Arkansas keeps a balance she said. The region is a good place to build a career and raise a family.

The potential for family was one consideration in her decision to move there said Kim Bryden founder and chief executive of Cureate. Her business helps market local sources advising producers and retailers.

""If you have a business on the side making ice cream or salsa and would like to leave your day job and do that full time we help you"" she said. Likewise if you're a grocer cafeteria coffee shop or other business offering food and would like to connect with local suppliers Cureate will make those arrangements.

Bryden's business succeeded in the mid-Atlantic states from the company's base in Washington D.C. according to Bryden and news accounts. She wanted to expand the business and decided the best way to pick a new location was to go take a look -- driving from Washington and scouting locations from West Virginia to New Mexico.

Northwest Arkansas appealed to her before she knew the $10000 reward and mountain bike prize was available. She applied won and moved to the region in July.

Bryden doesn't have children but wants them in the future she said. That was a factor in choosing this location with its attractions and access to still-unspoiled nature. But it was only one factor. The entrepreneurial outlook of local suppliers and merchants; the support received from local chambers the council and others; the room to grow the business; and other factors made the decision she said.

""Everything just clicked"" she added.

""If you had asked me about Northwest Arkansas before I came here I would have said 'What?'"" Bryden said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(NASDAQ:JKHY) After Its Third-Quarter ...,"It's been a good week for Jack Henry & Associates Inc. (NASDAQ:JKHY) shareholders because the company has just released its latest quarterly results and the shares gained 4.0% to US$169. It was a credible result overall with revenues of US$539m and statutory earnings per share of US$1.19 both in line with analyst estimates showing that Jack Henry & Associates is executing in line with expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.

Check out our latest analysis for Jack Henry & Associates

Taking into account the latest results the current consensus from Jack Henry & Associates' 15 analysts is for revenues of US$2.37b in 2025. This would reflect a solid 8.4% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to ascend 11% to US$5.75. Before this earnings report the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$2.38b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.74 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that although the analysts have updated their estimates there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.

The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$181 showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Jack Henry & Associates analyst has a price target of US$200 per share while the most pessimistic values it at US$170. Even so with a relatively close grouping of estimates it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations suggesting Jack Henry & Associates is an easy business to forecast or the the analysts are all using similar assumptions.

Taking a look at the bigger picture now one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same according to the analysts with revenue forecast to display 6.7% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 7.1% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 3.6% per year. So it's pretty clear that Jack Henry & Associates is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.

The Bottom Line

The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady in line with previous estimates.

Additionally our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry.

Jacob grew up in poverty and often experienced homelessness moving more than 14 times across three states with his mother. This childhood experience helped him “understand the critical role that the government can play in improving the lives of our residents” he said and would come to shape his work as a policymaker and community activist.

Jacob’s platform focuses on finding climate-centered solutions to issues ranging from affordable housing to racial justice. For example “homelessness in Rhode Island is a solvable challenge if we strategically spend the ($1.1 billion) in federal aid from the American Rescue Plan Act to build green affordable housing” Jacob said. “Our kids can receive quality education if we invest in equipping them with 21st-century workforce development opportunities that attract high-paying union green jobs.”

Jacob hopes to fund these projects through increased taxes on the rich. “The top 1% of earners need to pay their fair share in taxes” he said.

While in the mayor’s office Jacob worked on the creation of a behavioral health response program in which trained specialists respond to 911 calls rather than traditional law enforcement. He also led the design of a program set to launch in October that aims to alleviate fiscal burdens that prevent Providence residents from regaining their driver’s licenses helping to reduce “a key barrier to stable employment” Jacob said.

Jacob additionally helped launch Providence’s Truth-Telling Reconciliation and Municipals Reparations process by drafting an executive order that committed the City to acknowledging and redressing the atrocities committed against Black Indigenous and people of color in Providence. The project will secure a $100000 grant and facilitate “a process to determine what reconciliation in Providence could look like.”

“As a biracial person I am extremely proud to have been involved in this groundbreaking work” Jacob said. “I am committed to continuing to press for action on racial inequities in our state.”

Jacob’s work on this project is in part what led Rhode Island State Representative Leonela Felix to endorse him.

“I’ve worked with Bret and I’ve seen his dedication to the city of Providence” Felix said. “I’ve seen his work and commitment to doing what needs to be done in order to support our communities and in order to be able to move the city forward.”

Felix also praised Jacob’s collaboration with others saying the City and District 3 need leaders who “can bring innovative ideas to really help support our communities in need.”

To effect change the government needs candidates who can build community and push for consensus according to Felix. “That’s what I really see him bringing that collaboration that collaborative approach to government to make a difference.”

Jacob is also supported by the Rhode Island Working Families Party which works “to elect candidates committed to economic racial social and environmental justice and hold elected officials accountable to these core values” according to its website.

Zack Mezera ’13 the party’s organizing director explained that both WFP and Jacob have worked to expand wages for low-income residents increase taxes on the wealthy and provide protections for workers women immigrants and people of color.

“We got really excited about feeling confident that when Bret goes into the State House he’s going to stick to his progressive values” Mezera said. “He’s had those his whole life and has worked on them his whole life.”

“We feel like Bret has a record of working on WFP issues and working in the community for a long time on WFP issues” Mezera added. “He’s an organizer on his own and we think he’ll be an organizer in the State House too.”

Jeff Levy chair of the District 3 Senate Endorsement Committee and husband of former District 3 State Senator Gayle Goldin endorsed Jacob noting his “great ideas and positive energy.” Levy believes Jacob will bring a different perspective to District 3 after the state government has been “dominated by people with very similar backgrounds for a very long time.”

“To have somebody up there who grew up in poverty who’s experienced homelessness who’s queer and is a person of color will help Bret contribute to policymaking in the state in a way other people can’t” Levy said.

In running for District 3 State Senate Jacob hopes to “uphold (the district’s) legacy of electing progressive leaders with records of bringing people together to implement policies that forward our values.”

Tavernier led the institution for nearly four decades and worked closely with Thierry Fremaux the Lumière Institute’s managing director and Cannes Festival’s general delegate to host the annual Lumière Festival a star-studded celebration of heritage films and cinema masters. Lyon is actually the birthplace of the Cinematograph and its creators the Lumiere brothers.

Kicking off on Oct. 9 the event’s 13th edition will pay homage to Tavernier with a special tribute on Oct. 10.

Jacob who is originally from Switzerland is the granddaughter of Maurice Jacob a scientist and humanist who lived in Lyon all his life and has a street named after him in the city. A passionate film buff Jacob has been involved with the Lumière Festival since its inception introducing films and meeting moviegoers in cinemas and hospitals among other places.

“Helping guide the future of the Lumière Institute in a city I love is an exciting and inspiring mission” said Jacob who was unanimously elected by the board of directors of the Lumière Institute at its meeting on Sept. 30.

“Very touched and well-aware of the honor that has been bestowed upon me I will do all I can to live up to this commitment” said Jacob adding that she also had an “immense consideration for Bertrand Tavernier whose work at the head of the Institute has been significant.”

Jacob won the prestigious best actress prize at Cannes in 1991 for her part in Krzysztof Kieslowski’s “The Double Life of Véronique.” Kieslowski also directed Jacob in “Three Colours: Red” one of her best-known films along with Louis Malle’s “Au revoir les enfants” which marked her debut.

Besides Kieslowski and Malle Jacob has worked with multiple French and international auteurs including Michelangelo Antonioni Wim Wenders Theo Angelopoulos Agnieszka Holland Paul Auster Jonathan Nossiter and Hugh Hudson. She has also worked with Nadine Trintignant Claude Lelouch Serge Le Péron Pascal Thomas Riad Sattouf and Jacques Deray. The prolific talent has also acted in many plays most recently “Retour à Reims directed by Thomas Ostermeier.

At the head of the Lumiere Institute Jacob will continue to “ensure the existence of a public place that preserves and honours the history of cinema” spearhead the programming of classics heritage conservation and promotion publishing and image education said the Institute. She will also lead the board of directors.

Along with the special tribute honoring Tavernier’s legacy the anticipated highlights of this 13th edition include the Oct. 15 celebration of Jane Campion who will receive the honorary Lumière Award following in the footsteps of Martin Scorsese Clint Eastwood and Quentin Tarantino among others.

Campion’s latest film “The Power of the Dog” will also have its French world premiere at the festival. A Netflix movie it will not be released in theaters in France. Another high-profile Netflix film which opened at Venice and will have its French premiere at the Lumiere fest is Paolo Sorrentino’s “Hand of God.”

Several other films which played at Cannes and Venice will play in Lyon notably Catherine Corsini ‘s “La Fracture” Joachim Trier’s “The Worst Person in the World” Todd Haynes’s “The Velvet Underground” Gaspar Noé’s “Vortex” and Maggie Gyllenhaal’s “The Lost Daughter.” Other French premieres slated for the Lumiere Festival include Clint Eastwood’s “Cry Macho.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ncmVlbGV5dHJpYnVuZS9uYW1lL2phY29iLWR1cmFuLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTE4ODE5MzUw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jacob Duran Obituary (1967 - 2021) - Greeley CO - Greeley Tribune,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/greeleytribune/name/jacob-duran-obituary?id=18819350 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ncmVlbGV5dHJpYnVuZS9uYW1lL2phY29iLWR1cmFuLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTE4ODE5MzUw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jb21tZW50aXNmcmVlLzIwMjEvb2N0LzAzL3Jlc3BvbnNpYmlsaXR5LXBvbGljZS10cnVzdC1wcm90ZWN0LXdvbWVuLWRvbWVzdGljLXNleHVhbC12aW9sZW5jZS1iaWxs0gF9aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2NvbW1lbnRpc2ZyZWUvMjAyMS9vY3QvMDMvcmVzcG9uc2liaWxpdHktcG9saWNlLXRydXN0LXByb3RlY3Qtd29tZW4tZG9tZXN0aWMtc2V4dWFsLXZpb2xlbmNlLWJpbGw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The responsibility is on police to restore trust in their ability to protect women,"Being a police officer comes with a badge of trust. That trust was ruthlessly abused and betrayed by Wayne Couzens leaving us all reeling with horror rage and sadness. Despite some protestations this is not about one bad apple but instead about institutional misogyny within our police forces and a wider failure to tackle violence and domestic abuse against women and girls.

As the domestic abuse commissioner I hear from survivors every day who feel let down by the police and criminal justice system. Even before recent events there was a persistent lack of confidence among women who have experienced domestic abuse and sexual assault to come forward to report and to support prosecutions to bring offenders to justice.

Hundreds of reports of domestic abuse are made against serving police officers every year but the number who face criminal action or misconduct hearings is far far too small. In total the Bureau of Investigative Journalism uncovered nearly 700 reports of domestic abuse by police officers across the UK in the three years to 2018 – averaging more than four a week. Fewer than one in 10 reports resulted in a dismissal or warning. Only 3.9% in England and Wales resulted in a conviction – that’s compared to 6.2% among the general public which is itself deeply problematic. Figures from the Femicide Census show that at least 15 serving or former police officers have killed women in the UK since 2009.

Senior officers say this type of conduct has absolutely no place within policing. It is abundantly clear that we need to see a zero-tolerance approach to domestic abuse within police ranks and that no perpetrator should be a serving police officer. Clearly there are far more good officers than bad but it’s plain that many abusers aren’t being dealt with properly and we have heard reports of officers closing ranks and ignoring victims’ needs.

That problem can only be overcome by having a system in place that protects victim confidentiality and where investigations are handled externally. Unless there is a very good reason when an allegation is made against an officer it should immediately be sent to a neighbouring force to investigate – independent enough to do a proper investigation and near enough to facilitate local support services for the complainant.

More broadly there is no doubt the police must rebuild trust with women and girls who don’t feel safe on the streets or in their homes. But how can the police do this? Asking people to challenge lone plain-clothed police officers is not the answer. The onus should never be on the public to keep themselves safe from those in positions of power. Instead what we need is action. The police need to take responsibility for building trust with the public and demonstrate clearly that these crimes are a top priority.

The police have ample recommendations to work from. A recent report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services couldn’t have been clearer about the epidemic of violence against women and girls. It called for it to be treated as seriously as terrorism. The report written by Zoe Billingham outlined the need for urgent improvements in policing but also for far-reaching fundamental and radical change.

The police crime sentencing and courts bill going through the Lords provides the perfect opportunity to do this. It contains a proposed new serious violence prevention duty which requires a range of public bodies such as the police health authorities and probation services to work together to prevent and tackle serious violence.

This could provide a concrete chance to implement an early intervention public health focused approach to tackling serious violent crime rather than relying on traditional criminal justice solutions which only come into play after an offence has been committed. But as the bill currently stands the definition of serious violence in the prevention duty does not explicitly include domestic abuse domestic homicide or sexual violence.

Instead local areas are left to decide whether to include these crimes in their new serious violence prevention strategies resulting in a postcode lottery for women and girls. If the government does accept Gabby Bertin’s amendment to explicitly include domestic abuse domestic homicide and sexual violence it will be sending out a clear message to the public and the police that violence against women and girls is not acceptable and won’t be tolerated.

Trust in the police has been badly damaged. Now we need to see swift action. The safety of women and girls depends on it."

An Arizona woman accused of attempting to kill her husband by poisoning his coffee has been sentenced to three years probation.

Melody Felicano Johnson was initially charged with attempted first-degree murder and pleaded guilty to two counts of the lesser felony charge of adding poison or a harmful substance to food or drink in April.

Johnson could have faced a maximum of 2 years in prison for each count.

Her attorney requested the sentence be time served saying Johnson had already been in custody for nearly a year due to her inability to post a $250000 bond. Her sentence also included mental health treatment.

Judge Javier Chon-Lopez noted even the victim her estranged husband Roby Johnson had told the court he did not want Johnson to end up in prison.

The defendant’s husband told investigators he “believes she was trying to kill him to collect death benefits” according to a criminal report obtained last year by CNN affiliate KVOA. Roby Johnson said he first noticed a foul taste to his coffee in March 2023 while he was an airman stationed in Germany the document says.

The Johnsons were still living together with their child but were in the process of getting divorced. Roby and Melody Johnson’s divorce is still pending her attorney said.

Roby Johnson told detectives he used pool testing strips to determine his coffee pot “showed high levels of chlorine” and set up hidden cameras that reportedly caught Melody Johnson pouring bleach into a container and pouring the contents of that container into the coffee maker investigators said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d0b3AuY29tL2xvY2FsLXNwb3J0cy8yMDI0LzA1L2luY3JlZGlibHktc3BlY2lhbC1yYXJlLTE5MjAtamVyc2V5LXdvcm4tYnktd2FsdGVyLWpvaG5zb24td2hlbi10aGUtc2VuYXRvcnMtYmVhdC1iYWJlLXJ1dGgtaXMtbm93LXVwLWZvci1hdWN0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Incredibly special’: Rare 1920 jersey worn by Walter Johnson when the Senators beat Babe Ruth is now up for auction,"A piece of D.C. baseball history is up for sale and for sports memorabilia collectors its rarity is bringing up…

A piece of D.C. baseball history is up for sale and for sports memorabilia collectors its rarity is bringing up its value.

A game-worn jersey that belonged to Washington Senators pitcher and Baseball Hall of Famer Walter Johnson is currently at auction. Heritage House which is hosting the auction says the unique uniform is over a century old and valued at $3 million.

Production Manager Mike Provenzale told WTOP in the 20 years he’s worked for Heritage House Johnson’s jersey ranks at the top of all the items they’ve ever sold.

“It’s one of the most impressive items we’ve ever offered” he said calling the right-hander “one of the greatest sportsmen of all time.”

Using photo-matching the auction house traced the jersey back to April 29 1920 when the Washington Senators defeated the New York Yankees 2-1 at the Polo Grounds. It was the first time Johnson faced legendary hitter Babe Ruth. According to Provenzale Johnson earned his 299th career win while Ruth was only able to get a an RBI off a sacrifice fly.

“Through that photo-matching you’re able to identify the exact moment he was wearing it and when you can do that and it’s an important game with a lot of significant notes like that that just really piques the interest of high level collectors” he said.

This jersey was gifted by Johnson to teammate Eric “Swat” Erickson as a retirement gift after the 1920 season. Provenzale said Erickson brought a ranch in New York and had a barn where he kept all his sports collectibles including Johnson’s jersey.

“Decades later his granddaughter discovered it in the barn” Provenzale said adding that she was the one who initially sold it to a private seller.

Johnson’s legacy added an additional element that makes the jersey extremely valuable.

Known as “The Big Train” Johnson helped the Senators win its only World Series championship in 1924. He spent his entire 20-year playing career in Washington earning a record of 417-279 with a 2.17 ERA. For more than 50 years his 3509 strikeouts were the most thrown by a pitcher in the majors. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1936 prior to his death 10 years later.

“He was the most dominant pitcher. He holds numerous records. He has the most scoreless games the most consecutive years leading the league in strikeouts” Provenzale said. “Essentially it’s him and Cy Young who are considered … the greatest pitchers of all time.”

Unlike modern jerseys which teams and players hold on to due to their value at the time uniforms were not seen with much significance other than being work clothes. The fact that Johnson’s gift survived is “a miracle” Provenzale said.

“Jerseys in that era were considered disposable” he said. “They were worn and worn and repaired until they could no longer be repaired.”

There is only one other known jersey worn by Johnson that exists and it is sitting in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown New York. Combined with the disposable nature of uniforms in the past it is unlikely that another game-worn Johnson jersey will surface Provenzale said.

“So if you’re interested” he said. “This is the opportunity to get it”

The auction ends on May 17.

Johnson was placed on the 15-day injured list during the last road trip due to elbow inflammation.

Pierce Johnson is doing well Brian Snitker said. He was scheduled to throw a touch-and-feel off the bullpen mound today.



No update on Tyler Matzek. He’s been shut down from throwing for a brief period. — Justin Toscano (@JustinCToscano) May 10 2024

Brian Snitker had previously said that they didn’t think the situation with Johnson’s elbow was serious but they wanted to get ahead of it. Johnson has been a key piece of the Braves’ bullpen since he was acquired at the trade deadline last season. Johnson has appeared in 13 games and has a 3.00 ERA and a 2.83 FIP in 12 innings.

Per Toscano there was no update on Tyler Matzek who was also placed on the 15-day injured list with his own bout of elbow inflammation. Matzek has been shut down from throwing.

Matzek missed all of the 2022 season while recovering from Tommy John surgery. There was initially talk of him beginning the season on the injured list but he showed enough during the spring to earn a spot on the Opening Day roster. Things haven’t gone well for Matzek though as he has allowed 11 runs in 10 innings across 11 appearances. He’s been hit particularly hard of late allowing six earned runs in his last three innings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWxtYmVhY2hwb3N0LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvcGdhLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvd2h5LWR1c3Rpbi1qb2huc29uLXNheXMtbGl2LXBsYXllcnMtc2hvdWxkLWJlLXJld2FyZGVkLWluLXBnYS10b3VyLW1lcmdlci83MzYyOTg3NTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Dustin Johnson says LIV players should be rewarded in PGA Tour merger,"Dustin Johnson has a completely different take on those who shunned the PGA Tour for LIV Golf and those who are being hailed as loyalists for remaining on the tour.

Speaking on the second second season of the Netflix series ""Full Swing"" Johnson believes those golfers who were handed tens and some hundreds of millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund are the ones who ""took the risk."" One reason is the criticism those golfers received from joining a league financed by a country with atrocious human rights violations.

Johnson who lives in Jupiter also wonders why those who remained on the tour — many turning down those multimillions — should be compensated if the two sides one day unite.

""No I don't"" Johnson said on the episode when asked whether PGA Tour players were owed compensation if LIV players returned to the tour.

""The guys that went to LIV we took a lot of criticism. We're the ones that took the risk for everything. So why should they be compensated? Obviously if this merger comes along there's gonna be a lot of guys who wish they would've signed.""

With no final deal since the framework agreement was announced 11 months ago one heavily discussed aspect is how PGA Tour players are rewarded and LIV golfers penalized for their decisions.

PGA Tour players are being promised very large sums of money through the enterprises' equity share plan. Large as in a reported $100 million for Tiger Woods $50 million for Rory McIlroy and $30 million for players like Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth according to the The Telegraph.

When it comes to legacy reputation and their safety Johnson is correct. These players have made sacrifices.

Paulina Gretzky Johnson's wife revealed that the couple received death threats after her husband joined LIV.

""People sending death threats and awful awful awful things"" she said. ""People were aggressive that’s for sure. But that’s when I shut it down for a little bit. I was like I don’t need to look at this. Everyone has an opinion on it. Fine.”

But financially … Jon Rahm's sacrifice will earn him a reported $550 million including bonuses for joining LIV while Johnson Phil Mickelson Bryson DeChambeau Brooks Koepka and Cam Smith reportedly all signed with LIV for more than $100 million.

And many others will earn tens of millions such as Tyrrell Hatton who reportedly signed for around $65 million.

Johnson Controls a technology company has chosen Ava Robotics a developer of intelligent robots for improved productivity and safety to power its new Tyco Security Robot.

The fully autonomous robot which made its debut at the Global Security Exchange (GSX) Conference in Orlando includes sensors touchscreens and integrates two Tyco Illustra cameras to streamline security operations maximize staffing automate processes and increase operational efficiency says the company.

“Ava’s mobile autonomous and innovative robotics technology helped close the loop of solutions we needed to increase and streamline security operations. The robots observe monitor and notify staff so they can focus more on taking the right action in real-time” said Jason Ouellette Johnson Control’s director of technology and business innovation.

The security robot is said to deliver enhanced deterrence and high-quality evidence for investigations managing repeatable security tasks and enabling security personnel to focus on other priorities.

The Security Robot further offers:

People detection to determine when people are present at unexpected times or locations

to determine when people are present at unexpected times or locations Incident prevention to limit potentially harmful incidents and minimize negative or dangerous interactions

Plans for the placement were revealed in a filing earlier in September.

According to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Wedbush and Maxim Group ""have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to arrange for the sale"" of shares being offered. Hall of Fame Resort isn't obligated under the agreement to sell any shares.

Wedbush is a privately held investment firm based in Los Angeles. Maxim Group is a dealer broker based in New York.

Eric Hess director for investor relations said the recent SEC filings are a process that give Hall of Fame Resort the opportunity to sell additional shares if it decides to make that move.

""It's a nice tool to have in place when we need it"" he said.

The company has about 95.2 million shares of common stock traded on the NASDAQ market. The number of shares could exceed 114 million if the additional $50 million shares are sold at a price of $2.65 per share. The stock closed at $2.65 on Wednesday and Thursday then rose to close at $2.66 on Friday.

Earlier in the week Hall of Fame Resort announced it issued 900 shares of preferred stock to American Capital Center LLC priced at $1000 per share for a $900000 investment. American Capital already invests in Hall of Fame Resort and is affiliated with Stuart Lichter a member of the company's board.

Hall of Fame Resort formed in July 2020 to develop Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls. The Hall of Fame Village project started in 2014 with construction of Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium and youth athletic fields.

The company is in the midst of the second phase of the project. The $300 million investment included the purchase and renovation of the DoubleTree by Hilton hotel in downtown Canton and construction of the Constellation Center for Excellence west of the stadium.

Work is underway to prepare for construction of two retail centers a Tapestry by Hilton hotel an NFL-themed water park and a performance center.

The retail center will include a Don Shula restaurant a Helix eSports complex operated by Esports Entertainment Group and craft brewery The Brew Kettle tied in with a Topgolf Swing Suite.

The features were outlined as part of a recent Xbox Accessibility Showcase which also announced wider improvements to accessibility across the Xbox platform. Paige Johnson UX/UI producer at 343 Industries explained that when it comes to accessibility in Halo Infinite the team at 343 “knew we needed to be intentional about including the gaming and disability community so that we weren’t being unintentionally exclusive.”

“Inclusion is core to the Halo Infinite experience” 343 Industries writes in an Xbox Wire post “and in recognition of that the team built in new features to enable people to customize their Halo Infinite gameplay experience.”

The features are wide-ranging and include subtitles that are on by default with adjustable font sizes options to change background opacity and to enable color-coding per speaker in dialogue. Adjustable font size is not limited to the game’s subtitles and can be controlled across the game’s menus which also have a new menu narration feature with adjustable speed and volume.

A linear navigation feature will allow players to move through the UI without needing to visually see how controls are positioned on screen and HUD opacity adjustments have been added to make elements more visible for low-vision players. For color blind players there’ll be more options than just red and blue when it comes to friendly and enemy colors.

Players will also have more control over their audio experience in the game with a range of volume sliders as well as new text-to-speech and speech-to-text options for those participating in voice chat.

When it comes to controls Johnson says there’s “a ton of customizability for both controller and keyboard and mouse.” This includes key rebinding sensitivity adjustments and movement-assisted steering which adds additional controls when driving wheeled vehicles in the game.

Johnson identified Halo Infinite’s new sensory settings which have been created to improve cognitive accessibility as being among her favorite additions. These sensory settings will give players control over things like radial blur screen shake during high-intensity moments and the transparency of full-screen effects like shield recharges.

(Image credit: 343 Industries/Xbox)

Beyond settings 343 is taking steps to improve representation in Halo Infinite. Johnson revealed that the developer has been working with organizations such as Warfighter Engaged to offer new prosthetic options for Spartan customization.

“Accessibility is a journey” 343 writes “and 343 Industries will continue to update Halo Infinite in ways that empower as many people as possible to battle alongside the Master Chief.”

As far as wider improvements to the Xbox platform are concerned Microsoft announced new accessibility feature tags for the Microsoft Store on Xbox. These tags will make it easier for gamers to identify whether or not a game has the accessibility features they want prior to purchase.

Members of the Xbox Accessibility Insiders League (XAIL) currently have access to the tags and will provide feedback for refinement and improvement. The post states that there are 20 tags at the moment with the intention of having more in the future. Microsoft is also applying a degree of quality control to the features. For example for a developer to say that their game has subtitles the text must meet a specific font size and be resizable by up to 200 percent.

Microsoft has more plans to improve accessibility on Xbox over the coming months with features such as quick settings new and improved color filters night mode and globalization of speech-to-text / text-to-speech chat settings. You can see these detailed in full over on the Xbox Wire post.

Analysis: Accessibility is key

While there’s undoubtedly still a great deal more to do it’s good to see Xbox and 343 Industries making positive considered efforts to make games and the Xbox platform generally more accessible to players both in terms of settings and overall representation.

A lot of the time discussions around the future of gaming focus on the improved graphics framerates and game libraries that a new generation of consoles is expected to bring. It’s exciting to see that accessibility is increasingly part of those discussions and we can only hope it goes further. The future of gaming ought to be more inclusive. As the new Xbox Series consoles launched late last year Xbox invited players to “power your dreams with a new generation of Xbox”. It’s the kind of slogan that puts players at the center and promises empowerment without limits so it’d ring hollow if Xbox didn’t take steps to include everyone in the gaming community. “Power (some of) your dreams” doesn’t really work does it?

Xbox has been notable for its steps to improve accessibility in recent years with the customizable Xbox Adaptive Controller and the creation of its Xbox Accessibility Guidelines as well as the Xbox Accessibility Insiders League (XAIL) which was set up to provide “a simple streamlined way to provide accessibility feedback directly to Xbox engineering or game development teams.” This recent showcase shows that Xbox intends to go further and that can only be a good thing.

Colleagues became irritable when she asked a lot of questions and called her unreasonable when she’d ask them to not play music because it made it tough for her to focus. Sometimes Austin would cry when she felt overstimulated or overwhelmed only to be told that she shouldn’t take work so personally.

“I would hide anything that was hard and when I failed at things I just kept apologizing and repeating what [colleagues] told me that I had no excuse to be doing poorly at my job” Austin said.

Two years ago Austin discovered she was autistic. “It changed my life in all kinds of ways” including realizing why the office proved so uncomfortable. Equipped with this knowledge Austin began looking for a new job. The search led her to JPMorgan Chase and its Autism at Work program launched in 2015 — a program focused on hiring and supporting employees with autism.

Six months ago Austin began working at the bank’s Chicago office in its operations support department. She feels supported by her bosses and colleagues and by Rangam the organization that helps JPMorgan Chase with its Autism at Work program. (Austin is a Rangam employee contracted to work at JPMorgan Chase.)

“I am not ‘tolerated’” Austin said of her new workplace. “I am accepted and thought of as a person who like every other person on the planet has some challenges.”

And her boss loves her. “Heather is extremely focused and shares with us how much she enjoys her role” said Nuvia Vega operations manager. “Her focus allows her to provide high-quality work which is priceless to our business” Vega said adding that Austin consistently meets productivity rates.

This is the first in a three-part series on building a stronger tech workforce.

An Untapped Workforce

JPMorgan Chase’s Autism at Work program taps a hidden workforce: People who are neurodivergent. Their diagnoses include but are not limited to autism attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) dyslexia and social anxiety disorders. As many as 90 percent of adults with autism or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are unemployed or underemployed and 77 percent who are unemployed say they want to work according to 2016 National Autistic Society research.

Definitions Neurotypical: This refers to a person who is considered part of the normal variation in the human population. Essentially it is used to describe people who are not on the autism spectrum or have a developmental difference.

Neurodivergent: This describes a person who differs from what is considered typical thought patterns and behaviors. It can include diagnoses like autism ADHD social anxiety and dyslexia.

Neurodiversity: A descriptor for a group of people ranging from neurotypical and neurodivergent. As a relatively new term it is not preferred by everyone within the autism community.

Adults with ADHD or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder are 42 percent less likely to be employed full time than adults without the disorder according to a National Institutes of Health white paper on the subject.

Faced with a labor shortage and a desire to build a stronger tech workforce companies ranging from Google Cloud to SAP to Microsoft have launched programs to harness this underused talent. “Many companies are seeking out [neurodivergent] employees because of their unique skill sets and analytical skills” said Scott Allen a licensed clinical psychologist at Just Mind Counseling in Austin Texas who works with tech professionals who are affected by autism spectrum ADHD and related disorders.

Neurodivergent people “often have strengths that are paramount to the industry” Allen said. Among them: The ability to continue with a redundant task over time the need for predictability and rules central to coding ‘outside of the box’ thinking and the ability to focus on small details without being distracted by other stimuli.

“I am fully convinced that individuals with ASD will likely help solve many of our world’s problems” Allen said. “There is a level of pragmatism that helps take the emotions and stress out of decision making and also a level of creativity that leads to new and often better approaches.”

A Question of Disclosure

“It’s a different way of thinking” said Dawn Sizer owner of 3rd Element Consulting an IT consultancy based in Mechanicsburg Pennsylvania. “The average person might think in a linear fashion: If A plus B equals C then the outcome is going to be D” she said. People who are neurodivergent “don’t necessarily think that the outcome will be D” she explained. “That out-of-the-box thinking is really amazing in the IoT world.”

Two of Sizer’s 10 employees have autism and one has ADHD. The key idea here is that the employees feel comfortable enough to share their diagnoses. A neurodivergent person might well apply for and receive a position without the hiring manager ever knowing — and federal law prohibits hiring managers from asking any question around disabilities.

“I am not ‘tolerated.’ I am accepted and thought of as a person who like every other person on the planet has some challenges.”

Sizer ends initial interviews with this question: “Is there something that makes you unique or different that you’d like to share?” The question can give candidates the opportunity to disclose information about a diagnosis “and gives you the opportunity to change how you’re interviewing to suit that person and potentially get a really good employee” she said.

Self disclosure and self advocacy are “a huge theme” in working with adults on the autism spectrum said Allen of Just Mind. “It’s important for individuals to know when and whether to disclose keeping in mind that not disclosing also means that the worker may not be eligible for accommodations at work” he said.

Individuals who do share this information during interviews might fear discrimination (in the form of no job offer). Even so he considers it “especially vital” for people with ASD. “ASD or Asperger’s are often considered ‘hidden disabilities’ because they are often not immediately observable” he said.

Beyond the interview process tech companies must accept the soft-skill challenges that hires who are neurodivergent sometimes bring to the workplace Allen said. “Neurodiverse individuals can be quite assertive with opinions and points of view often struggle with reading nonverbal cues and lose sight of the ‘big picture’ due to focus on details” he said.

A Stronger Cybersecurity Team

Over the past several years Bank of America has hired dozens of professionals who are neurodivergent into tech roles said Craig Froelich chief information security officer at the Charlotte North Carolina-based financial services firm. The group has the highest rate of job-offer acceptance and a near 100 percent retention rate Froelich said.

Cybersecurity needs the problem-solving skills of people who are neurodivergent he said. “You’re trying to anticipate the actions of an adversary and being able to do that means having the best and brightest minds around the table” he said.

He recalled a conversation some years back with a Bank of America cryptographer a “spectacular” employee who holds several security-related patents. One day in the middle of a casual chat she revealed to Froelich that she was neurodivergent. “I was taken aback because I didn’t even know what that meant” he said.

After that the cryptographer who is on the autism spectrum has dyslexia and ADHD asked Froelich to send information on topics for discussion in advance of a meeting; as a person who is neurodivergent it would help her better prepare for meetings.

The conversation made Froelich wonder how many employees identified as neurodivergent but not publicly. He brought up the topic at an all-hands meeting with his 3000 employees. After the meeting his inbox flooded with replies from people who were neurodivergent or had neurodivergent family members interested in cybersecurity as a career. “I realized pretty quickly that neurodivergent teammates were already part of our workforce” he said.

The cybersecurity sector as a whole he added needs two and a half to three million people to fill the skills gap by the end of this year. “I wanted to see if we could tap into this as a new pipeline for recruiting talent” Froelich said. “That’s where the journey began.”

Bank of America partners with Philadelphia-based Neurodiversity in the Workplace to recruit and hire neurodivergent people. Working with the organization Bank of America has adjusted some recruiting and interviewing practices to suit the needs of neurodivergent people. For instance interviewers ask clear close-ended questions (answered with a yes or no) in order to extract the best information from neurodivergent candidates “and really unlock the powers they bring to the table” Froelich said.

Over the course of a week neurodivergent candidates also complete a series of projects so hiring managers can see how they relate to peers and to the project. Some adjustments for instance training managers to frame and ask questions in a very specific way have improved the hiring process for all employees he said.

“I have an innate ability to understand extremely complex processes in a fraction of the time that it takes others.”

Once on board support for some include quiet places to work noise-cancelling headphones and an employee resource group to support neurodiversity.

Froelich envisions the program expanding to include career pathing for neurodivergent talent. “We’re always thinking about how to do more but I want to be thoughtful” he said. “We are talking about real people and their lives and I want to make sure that we are doing this right.”

Such supports have helped employees like Carly Ott forge stable and successful careers. Ott who has been diagnosed with autism has worked at Bank of America for 11 years. Prior to that her longest engagement at any company had been about 18 months. “I’d get hired identify all the process gaps improve them get bored then find an entirely different job in an entirely different industry” said Ott now vice president and senior operations project manager at Bank of America.

Ott credits her tenure to two factors one of which is her own talent. “I have an innate ability to understand extremely complex processes in a fraction of the time that it takes others” she said. “I can not only grasp the big picture but slice and dice requirements to cover all of the nuances” to the point where she has trouble separating strategy from tactics. “In my brain they’re the same” Ott said.

The other is Bank of America’s “incredibly supportive” leadership team. “They’re cognizant that communication differences may exist and we have a two-way open-door policy to bring up possible miscommunications openly” she said.

A Sense of Belonging

Out of New Relic’s 2200 global employees 10 percent or 235 people say they are neurodivergent or allies of the neurodiverse community said Tracy Williams chief people and diversity officer at the San Francisco-based developer of cloud-based software. “New Relic strives to embed belonging throughout the employee lifecycle” Williams said.

It starts with the job interview. New Relic’s HR people organize a “candidate’s choice” interview that connects candidates to an existing employee in a community for which they feel an affinity or whom they feel represents them. “The first people you meet are essential to fostering a sense of belonging” Williams said. “Through candidate choice interviews and other innovative practices we are working to ensure that talented candidates start to feel a sense of comfort and belonging even before their first day” she said.

Management touches to further that sense of belonging include a focus on micro-interactions. Employees can ask their managers for support in gaining the floor during a meeting taking time to process feedback or blocking out uninterrupted time to work.

Accommodations reinforcing the sense of belonging include large meetings enabled with closed captioning. Employees can request live captioning during video meetings. The company strives to make lighting adjustable wherever possible in work spaces conference rooms and drop-in spaces Williams said.

Different workspace configurations from collaborative areas with modular furniture to small spaces for quiet work meet the needs of all workers. Wellness rooms in many global offices also offer completely private spaces to take a break she said.

“Through candidate choice interviews and other innovative practices we are working to ensure that talented candidates start to feel a sense of comfort and belonging even before their first day.”

One of New Relic’s five employee resource groups Neu Relics was created in 2018 by neurodivergent employees to support the neurodiverse community and allies. The group hosts talks events and workshops for the entire company and plans bigger events for Mental Health Awareness Month each May. This year the group brought in a consultant to host a company-wide workshop on managing stress and burnout.

After listening and tuning into the conversations from the ERG New Relic management offered all employees a week off called Relic Recharge Week in early August. “The daily kindnesses that neurodiversity awareness brings are an important part of the experience at New Relic” Williams said.

JPMorgan Chase piloted Autism at Work in Delaware with four initial employees. By their sixth month of employment the four worked 48 percent faster and were as much as 92 percent more productive than their neurotypical peers said Ramon Heredia Autism at Work program lead for JPMorgan Chase’s Chicago market which has 20 employees who are neurodivergent. The four employees were also more likely to check in daily with their managers to chart progress and spot points for improvement.

That initial success prompted the bank to expand the program. The bank now employs about 250 people through the Autism at Work program a group that boasts a 90 percent annual retention rate. Their roles range from personal banker to managing director to equipment operators like Heather Austin.

“It all goes to their capabilities and what they’re interested in” said Heredia stressing that neurodiversity is a broad spectrum. “When you’ve met one person with autism you’ve met one person with autism” he said.

How to Accommodate Neurodivergent Employees “Be direct in communication. Provide agendas and presentations in advance for people to prepare for meetings. Make sure fonts contrast with backgrounds and the most important information is at least 18-point type. These small things make interactions easier for everyone and can make a huge difference for your colleagues who are on the outside edges of the neurodiversity bell curve.” — Carly Ott vice president and senior operations project manager Bank of America

“Look at your internal culture. Do you have training in place for all leaders to look at different abilities and differences as a benefit to your company? Also do you have a solid accommodations process that will assist those with differences to fulfill and meet their potential as opposed to discouraging them from even asking? Most disability accommodations cost a company less than $500 and for autism that drops to less than $100 if not free.” — Carly Ott Bank of America

“Much of the hiring comes down to the interview and job posting. Many job postings out there are tone-deaf as to what skills are needed and who should apply (i.e. those infamous “entry level” postings that require 3+ years’ experience). The interview process doesn’t have to be stressful either! If there aren’t five people watching your screen after you are hired you shouldn’t judge somebody on how they code in front of five people.” — Scott McKell software engineering consultant Salt Lake City Utah

Working with Rangam the bank has adjusted its interviewing and onboarding process for neurodiverse candidates. They first tour the working floor to observe the kind of work they would do and inspect the office environment to see if it might trigger sensitivity issues. “We have a conversation with the candidate about how they feel about the role and the environment” Heredia said. “We have a huge understanding of the importance of accommodations.”

Interview questions are trimmed down; for instance an interviewer might ask about a candidate’s last two years of experience rather than the broad “tell me about yourself” question. They also avoid hypothetical questions in favor of direct questions related to work experience education and transferable skills.

“Companies should really be looking at hiring a neurodiverse workforce. They’ll find an untapped pipeline of simply brilliant people — highly educated highly capable detail-oriented.”

Once hired on-the-job accommodations range from noise-cancelling headphones low lighting seating in low-traffic areas stress balls (palm-sized rubber balls that can alleviate stress when squeezed) and even a raccoon tail for employees to simulate petting of a housepet. During reviews representatives from Rangam might sit in to help talent understand what’s needed to progress. “Sometimes they feel more comfortable because of the relationship” with Rangam Heredia said.

Neurodivergent employees can quickly become subject-matter experts prompting colleagues to regard them as invaluable resources Heredia said. Their presence has encouraged some employees to speak openly about their own diagnoses too. “They come forward and say ‘I’ve been struggling with this because I’ve never felt comfortable about disclosing but I do now because of the shift I see in the culture’” Heradia said.

Eight thousand JPMorgan Chase employees and managers have completed an autism awareness course which trains managers on best management practices for neurodivergent employees. One example: Breaking down instructions and questions to basic components so they may be easily understood. “These things don’t require a massive change to the business and they end up being beneficial for everyone not just neurodivergent individuals” he said.

Neurodivergent employees also benefit from support circles consisting of a job coach a buddy or community mentor to help them navigate company culture as well as the larger neurodivergent community — either a formal cohort or other people who were previously hired through the program Heredia said.

“Companies should really be looking at hiring a neurodiverse workforce” Heredia said. “They’ll find an untapped pipeline of simply brilliant people — highly educated highly capable detail-oriented. With everything you read about companies struggling to find and keep great talent these days it just makes business sense.”

According to a Thursday report from the Las Vegas Review-Journal newspaper citing official information from the Nevada Gaming Control Board the 466 casinos in ‘The Silver State’ collected $1.166 billion from players in August while properties on the Las Vegas Strip recorded a swell of 97.2% year-on-year to $625.7 million. The source detailed that this six-month string of $1 billion totals is currently the state’s second-longest such streak and could equal the record of eight months set from November of 2006 should it continue through to the end of October.

Pinched pessimism:

The newspaper reported that the casino market in Clark County didn’t clear the $1 billion mark as it did in July but nevertheless posted an impressive August upturn of 67.3% year-on-year to $993.4 million. Elsewhere and the North Lake Tahoe purportedly area posted a comparable 9.3% surge while the tally in neighboring South Lake Tahoe grew by 8%.

Environmental effect:

The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that these latter areas were seriously impacted by the closure of US Route 50 which runs into the adjacent state of California as a result of large forest fires in the nearby Sierra Nevada Mountains. This situation purportedly forced several of the largest Lake Tahoe casinos to begin shutting up shop from the end of August although their counterparts in Las Vegas benefitted from the post-coronavirus return of several popular shows such as the Michael Jackson One production from Cirque Du Soleil at the Mandalay Bay.

Comprehensive correlation:

Looking at the August figures in comparison with the same month in 2019 and the newspaper reported that statewide casino win was up by 7.8% as only the Las Vegas Strip North Las Vegas and Laughlin areas tallied numbers that were inferior to two years ago. Conversely and analogous properties in downtown Las Vegas purportedly posted revenues that were 23.2% better while an improvement of 18.9% was seen by off-Strip venues.

Rugged revival:

Joseph Greff works as an analyst for financial services behemoth JPMorgan Chase and Company and reportedly declared that the year-to-date casino revenues in Nevada are indicative of a ‘robust recovery no matter how you cut it’ with tax collections for the current fiscal year up by 11.4% year-on-year to $263.9 million. He purportedly used a Thursday report to additionally show that slot win from casinos located along the Las Vegas Strip has risen by 38% since 2019 as associated handle escalated by 38%.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5ibG9vbWJlcmd0YXguY29tL3RheC1pbnNpZ2h0cy1hbmQtY29tbWVudGFyeS93ZWVrLWluLWluc2lnaHRzLW1vbmV5LW1ha2VzLXRoZS13b3JsZC1nby1yb3VuZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Week In Insights: Money Makes the World Go Round,"In a famous scene in the movie “Cabaret” Sally Bowles played by Liza Minnelli and the Master of Ceremonies played by Joel Grey belt out the showstopper “Money makes the world go around” noting “Of that we can be sure.”

It’s true. Despite the push in some sectors for a cashless society and a rise in the use of virtual currency cash and cash equivalent still play a crucial role in governments and in banking and financial sectors all over the globe. That’s become increasingly clear when it comes to transactions that impact tax reporting and compliance.

Not convinced? Just look at the push to stop a measure under consideration in Congress as part of the reconciliation package that would require banks to hand over some account information to the Internal Revenue Service. It made the rounds on social media and in water coolers as taxpayers worried about handing over their bank information.

Banks loans and financial deals have played major roles in other tax stories this week from planning to compliance. Questions about transparency self-dealing and funding necessarily impact tax policy. Fortunately our experts have the latest federal state and international tax analysis to keep you up to date.

Quick Numbers Trivia

In how many countries are the world’s 10 biggest banks—by assets—headquartered?

(Answer at the bottom.)

Our Roundup

This week our experts touched on a wide range of topics from self-dealing to the impact of the OECD proposals. For a look at what’s making news here’s our roundup:

The way that we bank is changing. Declining activity in the underlying unsecured bank funding market together with the attempted manipulation from interbank lending rate panel banks have resulted in global regulators working on a transition roadmap from interbank offered rates (IBORs) to alternative reference rates (ARRs). In Addressing the Challenges of the IBOR Transition Under the Arm’s-Length Principle Marco Striato of GPBL—Gatti Pavesi Bianchi Ludovici considers the potential transfer pricing impact of the transition from interbank offered rates and discusses what multinational enterprises should be aware of when addressing the transfer pricing challenges.

Not all loans are created equal. In September the IRS announced that it will no longer issue private letter rulings on whether someone with substantial ties to a foundation can “wrap” a note to the foundation in an LLC to avoid self-dealing penalties. In IRS Won’t Rule on Wrapping Disqualified Person’s Note to Foundation in LLC Richard L. Fox of Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney explains how wrapping a note works and advises caution in such a transaction unless certain conditions are met.

Cash may no longer be king. Retail stores have struggled as a result of Covid-19 making it more important for stores to find liquidity and new ways to engage customers and strengthen supply chains. In Can the Tax Code Help the Upended Retail Sector? Ajay Wanchoo and Gregory Bocchino of KPMG LLP highlight how the retail industry can take advantage of federal and state research and experimentation credits to rebound from the pandemic.

While cash in hand is nice planning for future revenues could pay off. The pandemic has created a price gap between optimistic sellers who believe the economic recovery is imminent and more pessimistic buyers according to Evan Levine and Nainesh Shah of Complete Advisors. In An Introduction to Earnout Structures For Your Next Deal they describe several aspects of earnouts—opportunities for sellers to receive additional payments based on future performance—-and how they affect valuation for estate and income tax purposes.

One goal of the second pillar of the OECD’s global tax reform proposals is to ensure that certain multinational businesses pay a minimum level of tax. But are taxpayers already thinking about ways to get around it? In Hybrid Financial Instruments Might Reduce Impact of Pillar Two Proposals Lee Hadnum of Bloomberg Tax & Accounting considers how hybrid financial instruments could potentially be used by multinational enterprises to manipulate their effective tax rate and significantly reduce the impact of the Pillar Two proposals.

The Pillar One and Pillar Two proposals are being pitched as global solutions but will certainly impact individual countries. In BEPS 2.0: Global Measures and Their Impact for Portugal Rogério M. Fernandes Ferreira of RFF & Associados looks at the potential impact for Portugal’s tax revenue and fiscal competitiveness.

What exactly constitutes presence for tax purposes continues to be a theme around the world. In European Court of Justice Clarifies Concept of VAT Fixed Establishment Aiki Kuldkepp of Grant Thornton Netherlands discusses recent significant decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union which have clarified the concept of a fixed establishment for VAT purposes.

And the U.S. isn’t the only country scrambling to pass a budget deal. In September the National Assembly of Ecuador took the first look at a proposal from President Guillermo Lasso. In Ecuador: Agreements and Reforms to Reactivate the Economy Diego Andrés Almeida and Cesar Molina of Almeida Guzmán & Asociados consider the measures already taken by the new government as well as proposed future tax reforms intended to make Ecuador more attractive to investment.



Opinion and Commentary

Banks have been speaking out against a congressional proposal that would increase reporting requirements. But is that a good idea? In Banks Are Wrong to Fight New IRS Disclosure Charles Ellis and Alexander Boyle write that the key to enforcement is better-targeted audits not just more of them. And the key to more effective audits they claim is information.

And speaking of Congress what else is in the spending bill? In Is Biden’s Economic Plan Actually a Good Idea? Tyler Cowen writes that there has been remarkably little policy debate about it and remarkably little attempt to persuade the American public that this spending is a good idea.

One of the pieces that didn’t make it into the congressional proposals is the stepped-up basis at death. In To Reform Stepped-Up Basis at Death Focus on Tax Shelter Recharge Gavin Landgraf talks about capital gains tax forgiveness and what he has labeled “tax shelter recharge.”

The plan to increase taxes for the wealthiest Americans includes limiting some juicy retirement tax breaks. In The High-Earner Tax Break That Democrats Forgot Alexis Leondis wonders why Congress isn’t targeting cash balance plans. For lawmakers who say they want to tighten the menu of tax breaks for well-off people who are already saving for retirement she says these plans would seem to be low-hanging fruit.

Five years later the job-search process for people with felony convictions remains a nearly impossible gauntlet — even in the weird post-COVID times of record hiring activity and not enough workers.



In an op-ed published this summer by The New York Times JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon implored companies to help formerly incarcerated people rejoin the workforce. “This group is ready to work and deserves a second chance — an opportunity to fill the millions of job openings across the country he wrote calling on public and private sectors to rectify the “moral outrage” of discrimination against people with criminal histories.



That Dimon has gotten behind the issue (he claims JPMorgan the country’s largest bank has hired thousands of people with criminal records) is a sign reform may be on the way. The most successful progressive wins from gay rights to pot legalization materialized when financial interests began to back movements for change.

But there’s no magic bullet. It would take a major concerted push to encourage the private sector to look past the stigma of a felony conviction far beyond the current patchwork of fair hiring laws in a handful of states and cities. Virtually the entire punitive system is stacked against people trying to rebuild their lives after prison.

According to a 2018 Prison Policy Initiative analysis there are more than 1.3 million formerly incarcerated people in the U.S. at any given time who are unemployed. “They want but they can’t get” says Wanda Bertram communications strategist at the Prison Policy Project.

Meanwhile job openings in the U.S. hit a record of 10.9 million in July as the post-pandemic economy heated up.



In an interview with us Jason Weitzner who spent six and a half years in prison for selling pills and got out early after completing a rehabilitation program said he doesn’t have high hopes for career success. “There’s nothing I can get right now that can qualify as a career” he said. “It would all be temporary for me at this point. People just don’t respond.”



Before he went to prison Weitzner ran a successful smoke shop. He says it went downhill while he was incarcerated and he had hoped to revive the business. But the terms of his parole prohibit him from working at any smoke shop. That leaves his best options as menial jobs which are neither the best use of his skills nor what he wants to be doing at the age of 52.



“It's definitely a harder transition than I anticipated” he said.

Job-search problems for former inmates start upon release. Case managers and transitional halfway houses are supposed to help people with reentry but many of their procedures actually impede people’s efforts to start productive lives. Former inmates are encouraged to work but they’re also under heavy surveillance. Try doing a job interview with an ankle bracelet on or explaining to a boss that you can’t work late because you’re on a strict curfew.

“It sucks with the bracelet on there’s no flexibility” Weitzner said. “It's restrictive no question about it.”

Relatives who own a business might want to give you a chance but it’s usually against the rules for the formerly incarcerated to work for family members.

Then there are the laws that ban the formerly incarcerated from virtually all career-track jobs from medicine to cosmetology. According to the National Inventory of Collateral Consequences of Conviction there are more than 15000 legal provisions in the U.S. that restrict access to occupational licenses for people with a criminal history.

One might assume these laws are needed to protect the public— for instance by forbidding a convicted child molester from getting a job at a preschool—but some of these restrictions seem arbitrary.



In South Carolina you can’t become an anesthesiologist if you’ve been convicted of a felony or crime involving “moral turpitude or drugs.” Connecticut won’t let those convicted of offenses “involving fraud larceny or deprivation or misappropriation of property” run car repair shops. Nevada law prohibits people convicted of a felony from operating a charter bus. And several states find that a drug crime makes one too high-risk to become a barber.



Until recently California prohibited former prisoners who had fought the state’s wildfires for a fraction of the minimum wage from applying to fire departments upon their release. (The policy still stands but inmates with firefighting experience can receive a special certificate that makes them eligible to apply).



America’s biggest employers have had a mixed response to efforts encouraging them to hire formerly incarcerated people. On the website Indeed one person claimed they weren’t hired because of a trespassing misdemeanor while others with felonies wrote they’d gotten jobs.



Despite its pledge in 2016 it’s unknown whether Facebook has ever hired people with felony convictions according to the advocacy organization Successful Release. The Menlo Park California-based social media giant didn’t respond to our request for comment.



Long the world’s largest retailer before it was recently dethroned by Amazon Walmart does hire people with criminal records but only with restrictions according to Successful Release.



“We hire felons as long as their timeline of conviction has fallen off” the company told the group. They’re also barred from positions that involve firearms. While the company does not include questions about criminal convictions on applications it does conduct background checks on prospective hires.

Some business groups have argued in favor of hiring restrictions that keep the formerly incarcerated out of the workforce noting that people with criminal records might endanger customers or employees because they are statistically more likely to have engaged in dishonest violent or antisocial behavior. Yet steady employment is key to helping prevent former convicts from re-offending reform advocates say. The more solid and satisfying the job is the better.



Talking with The Business of Business Daniel Egipciaco a formerly incarcerated 41-year-old said he’s not above manual labor. But a former straight-A student he always had bigger ambitions like running a business.



One big mistake blew up his dreams. When he was 25 Egipciaco was persuaded by a government informant to help steal what he thought was cocaine from a drug cartel. The plan turned out to be a sting.

Believing he was a victim of entrapment he went to trial and lost getting stuck with a mandatory minimum of 25 years in prison. He served about 14 years before in light of excellent conduct and a showing of reforming himself the government agreed to revise their sentencing request. He’s now home with his family.



Egipciaco used to run a t-shirt shop and a music studio. He still aspires to get a college degree and become an entrepreneur. “You're starting from scratch” he says. “You can’t go to a bank and ask for a business loan without them asking if you’re a felon. The bar is set so high you can't even get back to where you were before you went away much less move ahead.”

Lee got on board with Kimberly-Clark in 1977 fresh out of Michigan Technological University and retired in 2018 having focused his attention for decades on producing pull-up training pants and Huggies diapers. His schedule now has him circulating largely around Aiken – sometimes on his 2005 Suzuki Boulevard if the weather allows – to put his talents in gear for worthy causes.

""I'm 65. I am blessed to be healthy and blessed to serve"" he said during a visit at the ACTS facility in the heart of downtown Aiken. ""I think we were put here to help other people ... and I'm just very lucky that I'm healthy and financially set up so that I can walk in the door and not worry about things. I can just do the things they need here.""

He is learning plenty about ""the things they need here"" in terms of ACTS as he is on course to be the organization's next president stepping up to that role for a one-year term starting Jan. 1 2022.

His own congregation St. Paul Lutheran has him on the church council and the property committee helping keep the physical facilities in good shape.

Lee with ACTS ""is the property committee pretty much"" he explained noting that he spends plenty of time dealing with such challenges as light bulbs faulty equipment and building modifications. ""We've taken walls down. We've put walls up. We've moved things around"" he said.

Current topics of conversation include the possibility of getting a walk-in freezer and whether ACTS might move to another facility in the years ahead if an arrangement can be made to acquire property that would be appropriate for clients first of all and volunteers as well.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMDMvdXMvZGlhcGVyLW5lZWQtd2FsbWFydC1zaG9wbGlmdGluZy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Diapers Are the Latest Pandemic Shortage,"“Anyone recognize him?” the police in Winter Haven Fla. asked on Facebook last month.

“When your card is declined and you try another one with the same result that is NOT license to just walk out with the items anyway” read the Facebook post which was later deleted.

The Winter Haven Police Department drew swift criticism for the post from people wondering why the department had gone after a man who had stolen basic necessities for his children also pictured in the surveillance photos.

“That’s a good father in a hard spot” one Facebook user said in response to the department’s follow-up post. “Have some empathy.”",,,,,,,,,

Barbara Stowe is the daughter of Greenpeace co-founders Irving and Dorothy Stowe.

September 15 1971. My family of four is standing on Fisherman’s Wharf at Vancouver’s False Creek in an activist crowd heavily bolstered by supporters and camera crews watching history being made. Twelve men are about to set sail for Amchitka Island Alaska on the Phyllis Cormack an aged halibut longliner. My father has hammered a sign on the bow renaming the boat for the voyage and Elaine Decker’s flag with the same new name – a canvas rectangle she sewed after her boyfriend Bill Darnell put “green” and “peace” together – flaps furiously from the mast.

Amchitka born of volcanic fire is situated in one of the most seismologically unstable regions of the planet. This is the site the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission has chosen for the biggest underground nuclear blast in American history.

While Pacific Rim countries nervously debate how to persuade president Richard Nixon not to detonate an atomic bomb in basically Russia’s backyard and Indigenous and environmental groups launch lawsuits to halt Mr. Nixon’s nuclear bid the Don’t Make a Wave Committee a small Vancouver group prepares to launch the Greenpeace.

The media is here in full force: UPI ABC CBC the National Film Board of Canada and independent journalists have all flocked to Vancouver for this day and the pier is so thick with cables it’s hard to walk around without tripping. My teenage brother backs up carefully aiming his Super-8 movie camera at my father and as a reporter shoves a fuzzy mike in Dad’s face my mother and I move out of camera range.

Dad’s smile is a ghostly grimace. We’re all of us faking it wooden with dread. If the blast sparks an underwater quake which generates a tsunami the Greenpeace will be right in its path. Not to mention radiation exposure if the bomb shaft fractures freak fall “williwaw” storms or the questionable seaworthiness of the jury-rigged boat. The partners of the crew are having the worst time of it – for my family it’s “just” our friends going off to war. They’re pacifists but there’s no such expression as “going off to peace” and what else can it be called when the battle lines are so clearly drawn? We – a volunteer muddle of flower children journalists engineers Yippies artists community activists and students plus a teacher social worker lawyer and a doctor – are going up against them the U.S. military industrial complex.

There is a clear enemy.

Or so we think.

Until 15 days later when Commander Floyd Hunter of the U.S. Coast Guard cutter the Confidence boards the Greenpeace in Akutan Alaska. By going ashore in Akutan and failing to make formal entry with customs the crew is in violation of the Tariff Act of 1930. Captain John Cormack listens politely to Cdr. Hunter while behind his back three Coast Guardsmen pass a message to the Greenpeace crew:

“Due to the situation we are in we the crew of the CONFIDENCE feel that what you are doing is for the good of all mankind. If our hands weren’t tied by these military bonds we would be in the same position you are in if it were at all possible. GOOD LUCK. We are behind you 100%.”

On Sept. 15 of this year in muted pandemic fashion Greenpeace celebrated a milestone 50th anniversary. It was a profoundly bittersweet moment. With 3.3 million supporters worldwide and offices in more than 55 countries the little ragtag group has become arguably the biggest eco-justice organization on the planet a success story by any reasonable standards. On the other hand Jennifer Morgan executive director of Greenpeace International spoke for all of us when asked what lies ahead: “I guess the goal would be that Greenpeace doesn’t exist anymore.” As the world floods and burns there’s no joy in correctly predicting climate crisis – only a desperate desire to stop it.

In times like these it’s essential to reconsider any preconceived ideas about the enemy. This year the organization has been re-examining itself: revisiting the past considering the successes and failures of five decades and trying to plan for a future that no-one can predict. As I spin down memory lane with others from the founding days the voice of my late father booms in my ears: “The people must take back the power over their lives!”

Yadda yadda I used to think as a teenager. How could a group of pacifists fight the mighty U.S. military industrial complex? I’d shrink back against the wall of Birks jewelry store at Georgia and Granville in the hub of downtown as the rest of my family and fellow Quaker activists Jim and Marie Bohlen and Bill Darnell sallied forth to hand out petitions and sell buttons. Lance Bohlen my age shrank back with me and I sensed a kindred spirit with the same horror of approaching strangers on a street corner. But when we sold a few buttons and made a few dollars toward saving the world from nuclear madness the way he pulled himself up to his full six feet showed that he felt as chuffed as I did. At those times we were brave. I liked the feeling of being brave.

Our home in West Point Grey functioned as the first Greenpeace office but after my father died in 1974 of pancreatic cancer the organization moved out. My brother and I moved out too – Bobby went to Eastern Canada to study physics and I went to New York (where no one had ever heard of Greenpeace) to dance. I was trying to communicate something ineffable something that offered respite from the troubles of the world. I longed for that respite.

Then in 1986 when a friend drew me into the Vancouver Peace Flotilla and with fellow activists we witnessed the breakdown of the same boundaries between “them” – the military – and “us” a pacifist contingent. In kayaks canoes and sailboats we rode out to greet U.S. warships as they arrived in Vancouver and our signs proclaimed that while the navy was welcome nuclear missiles were not. The sailors resplendent in white uniforms stood on multiple decks in an impressive formation that brought to mind a well-disciplined corps de ballet. Many flashed us peace signs and as they came off the ship I approached one not without trepidation to ask why he flashed the “vee.” He grinned and spoke first: “We don’t want to be sailing with nuclear missiles either.”

In the summer of 2007 John Hocevar oceans campaigner for Greenpeace USA initiated the “Bering Witness” tour. Despite scant contact with Greenpeace since the early days I found myself joining a 26-person crew on the Esperanza for three weeks. The newest boat in the now-international organization’s fleet a former Russian navy ship with five Zodiacs and a helipad was a far cry from the rickety Phyllis Cormack with her lone dinghy.

This was just the beginning of the shocks in store. My deeply ingrained perception of “the enemy” was about to be challenged anew.

The mission took us to coastal communities to record locals’ experience of what factory fishing and bottom trawling were doing to the marine environment. Greenpeace wanted to work in partnership with these communities to pressure government to create marine heritage zones and institute other preservation measures.

Greenpeace Alaska campaigner George Pletnikoff – native to this territory and a former Russian Orthodox priest – came aboard at Dutch Harbour to lead the mission with John. It had taken Greenpeace a year to persuade George to take the job and as we sailed through the Unangan islands the Russians had renamed the “Aleutians” we’d soon see the reason for his reluctance.

At Adak a U.S. military base slated to be closed two young mothers brought seven children to “Open Boat.” With recreation facilities shutting down visiting our ship was a rare break from boredom and Greenpeace colouring books were welcomed. That parents whose livelihood depended on the armed forces would freely expose their children to pacifist influence surprised us. In the Boop café (named for Betty Boop) a Filipina working behind the counter asked “Are you with the Greenpeace boat? Do they have any job openings?” Servicemen stopped us on the street to invite us to a barbecue and ask if Greenpeace was hiring.

None of these people were the enemy.

We went to St. George one of the four Pribilof Islands that sit magnificently isolated in the middle of the Bering Sea and as we puttered to the dock in Zodiacs we caught a brief glimpse of the life of the roughly 120 humans who populated this place. An Unangan man stood on a green hillside smiling at Mr. Pletnikoff putting a closed fist over his heart and George responded in kind.

Meanwhile a boy running down the hill was shouting: “George! George!” He was so excited he tripped and fell but picked himself up and kept running as George waved back. A younger child on the shoreline plucked something from the water and the running boy reaching him tried to grab it. “I want that sea urchin for my crab traps!” he said.

A woman gently chastised him. George later introduced her as the boys’ mother but I was only half present still digesting that for children here sea creatures were no curiosity but an essential ingredient of their culture and daily survival.

A big bear of a man with curly black hair and the warm brown skin of the people who’d lived on these islands for thousands of years George had superb comic timing that kept us all laughing.

But as the hour of a tribal council meeting approached he turned sombre. The people of St. George were deeply suspicious of an organization that had campaigned hard against seal-hunting a mainstay of their culture and crucial to their survival. They were especially suspicious of their former parish priest-turned-environmentalist who was now considered by many to be “the enemy.”

After sitting through the tense tribal council meeting in the morning we went to an evening community assembly in a packed hall. The air was icy with hostility. George set up a big screen and showed video footage of the tracks the bottom trawlers had scraped into the ocean floor. A woman sitting beside me leaned over and whispered: “It looks like a road.”

Then George screened interviews the campaigners had shot in other coastal communities. In one clip an Indigenous woman spoke of how she knew from the quantity of fish her mother was drying and storing that the time was coming when “our people will starve.” She sobbed unable to continue. The room had been steeped in a mistrusting silence but now the energy shifted as a mutual empathy and grief began to break down the edges of the boundary between “them” and “us.” When the film finished George turned on the house lights and began a Q & A and the boy who’d run to greet him at the dock raised his hand. “Is our culture dying?” he asked.

George’s whole body sagged. “Don’t you worry about that” he said but it was obvious what it cost him. “You let us worry about that.”

As the Q & A progressed it seemed the community was beginning to believe that Greenpeace was not here to criticize Indigenous hunting practises but to support Indigenous culture and forge an alliance based on environmental preservation until a middle-aged man raised his hand. “What about me?” he asked. “I work on one of those bottom trawlers. It’s my livelihood.” He was looking at me. My insides roiled. George had introduced me as the daughter of Greenpeace founders and I stumbled through a lame response thinking there is no answer to this question.

The answer came after the meeting when he approached George to warn him to expect a difficult reception from the people of St. Paul the next island we’d stop at and suggest how to appeal to the community there. I realized he was supporting our campaign even though it threatened his livelihood. Years later still trying to process this I told a relative who put it in perspective: “He’s bigger than his job.”

Unfettered capitalism consumerism and a disconnect from nature has created the current climate crisis with its increasing catalogue of disasters. Naomi Klein nailed the necessary road ahead with a vision for a sustainable future when she said: “The task is clear: to create a culture of caretaking in which no one and nowhere is thrown away in which the inherent value of people and all life is foundational.”

The gap between where we need to be and the current road that if followed will destroy us was illustrated – along with a partial answer to the question “who is the enemy?” – by a sign we saw when Captain Pete Willcox brought the Esperanza alongside at Constantine Harbour on now-deserted Amchitka Island. This was our final destination the last port of call before heading back to Dutch Harbour.

The day before we’d dropped anchor on the other side of the island and beach-landed in an eerie silence. Where were the sea otters that once played around these shores in what used to be the only designated sea otter sanctuary in the world? Where were the puffins and red-legged kittiwakes the teeming colonies of fur seals and sea lions that populated the coasts of other islands we’d stopped at? Amchitka appeared deserted and not just by the military but all living breathing creatures.

We hiked through muskeg to the shores of Cannikin Lake – the 30-acre body of water the US Atomic Energy Commission accidentally created by exploding the bomb code-named “Cannikin” and as one fisherman at St. Paul had put it “blowing the chit out of Amchitka.” Six lakes on the island disappeared then only to reconfigure themselves by some strange dark magic reappearing in the deep cavity above the borehole where a substantial part of the island had imploded.

On the boggy shore of Cannikin Lake I knelt and peered into the ground cover – there was plenty of that true a thick green spongy carpet barring the occasional barren patch – and parted the vegetation with my fingers until finally I found something moving. It was small and black and I didn’t want to get too close.

“Look” I called to the ship’s doctor Clive a fervent naturalist. “What is that? A spider?”

He bent down. “Yes.” Several engineers crowded in to see. One Slava held out his wrist to the spider. “Bite me” he said referencing Spider-Man and we all laughed darkly.

Now the following day on the other side of the island we stood on a weather-worn dock looking at a small sign that announced: “Office of Legacy Management.” It had an atomic symbol on the left-hand side and two fir trees on the right. In the middle on a stylized image of a white winding road stood a man holding the hand of a small child. The implication was clear: The Department of Energy’s Office of Legacy Management was a caring protective arm of a government that had paved a safe and trustworthy path to the future.

Only something was wrong. This father was turned fully away from his child looking in another direction disconnected out of touch. His hold on the child’s hand appeared tenuous as if he was about to let go or had forgotten the child was even there. This was the true legacy of nuclear weapons that blow things people worlds apart. This was an institution going down the wrong road driven by a dangerous arrogant blind paternalistic patriarchal disregard.

In one of this summer’s global Zoom calls with Greenpeace staff Ana Toni former board chair of Greenpeace International spoke passionately about the need for the organization to work harder to engage with people whose work impacts climate change negatively to see if there’s anything Greenpeace can do for them.

Of course she was by no means implying that Greenpeace could possibly supply jobs for every worker who might want to change direction – whether they be military personnel such as those we’d met on Adak men toiling in the tar sands of Alberta or loggers of old growth forest in Vancouver Island’s Fairy Creek who might be conflicted about the effects of their work. Greenpeace supported by donations not governments doesn’t have the resources to offer many new jobs. But one thing the organization does do is to model another vision of “work.” Because as the effects of climate change hit home increasingly the public is willing to support environmental and social justice advocacy groups trusting them to employ campaigners and scientists and engineers to do what governments are not doing to create green technology and pressure industry to change before it’s too late. Creating “Greenfreeze” refrigerators training thousands of volunteer firefighters in Russia all this is now essential labour. Countries will always have armies. Greenpeace offers a different kind of defence work.

Sipping Alaskan Summer beer in a bar with my shipmates on St. Paul the island we stopped at after St. George we listened to a hulking fisherman bemoan the damage factory fishing and bottom trawling has done to the marine habitat. “Greenpeace is 20 years too late!” he roared pounding a meaty fist on the bar making glasses jump. A minute later he grunted “I may not always like what Greenpeace does but if it wasn’t for them there’d be no boreal forests in the Amazon.” Later still he added: “My buddies and me refused to work on Amchitka. It’s radioactive.”

When jobs destroy people and the environment (a false separation the two are inextricably linked) we need systemic change. And in 2021 the need for systemic change couldn’t be more urgent. As climate justice activist Aneesa Khan has pointed out: “Climate change isn’t something in the future. That narrative is fundamentally flawed because there are millions impacted and so many displaced already.”

My father’s words “The people must take back the power over their lives” reverberate ever more strongly as the climate crisis escalates. In 2014 on Burnaby Mountain I watched police arrest Bill Darnell – the man I call “Uncle Bill” the quiet man who sat in meetings in our living room when I was a teenager the man who greened peace – for non-violent protest against the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project. Two years later moved by the action he and his fellow arrestees – including a Canadian soldier and a 13-year-old girl – took and by the eloquent oratory of the Tsleil-Waututh elders and by the many reasons so many people were standing against this project – I zip-tied myself to the Kinder Morgan tank farm gate with Greenpeace founder Rex Weyler to oppose the same project.

My brother joined us. It was standing room only at our first court appearance the room packed with many more arrestees than there were seats. Bobby and I hadn’t held hands since we were children but as Justice Kenneth Affleck lectured us all for violating the injunction he’d awarded to Texas oil giant Kinder Morgan we instinctively reached out to support each other.

At our second appearance Indigenous defendant Kat Roivas schooled His Lordship in colonialism: “You may be a lord but you are not my lord” and defendants started rising hands in the air blessing her in the traditional First Nations manner. I rose too nervous and defiant knowing we might be cited for contempt. There are some things that even a reluctant radical will put that most valuable of all assets personal freedom on the line for.

This spring almost 50 years after the Phyllis Cormack sailed for Amchitka Island five of us from the founding days received an extraordinary e-mail. Robert Keziere – whose photographs in The Greenpeace to Amchitka (co-created with Robert Hunter) brought the crew’s experience vividly to life – had received permission to forward a narrative written by Steve Todd.

It was Mr. Todd we learned who’d initiated that subversive note of support in 1971. After a nudging from his youngest son he’d put his experience down on paper.

His sons knew the tale from bedtime stories Mr. Todd had culled from his Coast Guard career. All the stories had titles like “When Dad got sick” or “When Dad saved the Captain” and the longest and most requested story was: “Sometimes it’s okay to break the law.”

Mr. Todd’s reaction on seeing the boat gave us the moment through his eyes: “It was very exciting to finally see exactly what the highly tracked and much publicized vessel looked like. I was the officer of the deck on the anchor watch and knew that the Captain intended to board the Greenpeace by evening to deliver the customs warning.” He thought about sending the crew “a kind of a thank-you note so to speak. After all who could appreciate what they were doing more than us Coast Guards who had been in the Alaskan weather and out on these waters every day and knew the risks they were taking to make an honourable voyage.

“I turned to mention this to Ken Grushoff the first class ET and he said to me ‘Todder I will get right on that!’ ”

Crewmate Andy Hrizuk dictated the message that 18 men signed.

When Mr. Todd and his crewmates found out that the note had become international news “The high anxiety commenced for me! I left the Confidence and made my first and only phone call out of Alaska to my dad and said ‘I might be going to Portsmouth [naval prison].’”

His father had done something similar in the Second World War following his conscience and replied “You gotta do what you gotta do.” These were reassuring words.

Later that night over gin and tonic Mr. Todd and Mr. Grushoff agreed that if they had it to do over again no matter the outcome they would have made the same choice.

It was public knowledge that 17 of the men who’d signed the note had been fined $15 to $100 or received suspended busts. But it was news to hear that as the only officer to sign Mr. Todd had been punished more severely.

Found guilty of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman he received three days restriction and a Letter of Reprimand. “Pretty much a career-ending service record document.”

And after three days he was put back on the job. Which raises the question of subversive support from those higher up the chain of command. But the most startling revelation in Mr. Todd’s text was this. The day the Atomic Energy Commission exploded Cannikin “The seas came up 50 feet. ... We ran before the sea north for 50 miles plunging our bow into the mountainous waves ... the whole ship shuddering as we rose up rolling and burying the air castles and taking green water over the flight deck. I thought how providential that the Greenpeace was not in this sea.”

By serving Capt. Cormack with the violation order that forced him to turn back had the U.S. Coast Guard an arm of the U.S. military actually saved the lives of the entire Canadian Greenpeace crew?

Had the enemy saved its nemesis?

No. Not its nemesis. Because it was never “us against them.” There are hidden allies points of solidarity between apparent opposites. In 2021 it’s Greenpeace’s job to increase this solidarity. The fact is that the 3532 staff the organization employs would gladly seek other employment if only there were no need for the goals laid down in the original constitution goals Greenpeace is still pursuing today.

Progress has been made toward those goals. The first to stop nuclear testing worldwide was addressed in microcosm when the U.S. quietly cancelled the Amchitka test series several months after the Greenpeace set sail and in macrocosm on Jan. 22 2021 when the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons came into force. Credit for the latter landmark achievement goes to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons but groups like Greenpeace which have been campaigning against nuclear weapons for decades have had a significant impact. All hands are needed on deck. As for the second goal “preserve the environment” this too will come down to solidarity. Millions of young people led by Greta Thunberg have joined student strikes for climate action and as settlers join forces with Indigenous activists and get woke the combined resistance to the forces that are destroying us become stronger. Recently Bill Darnell on evacuation alert this summer as fires ravaged forests near his home town of Vernon B.C. patiently echoed once more the blindingly obvious: “There is no longer any ‘soon’ for climate action. There is only ‘now.’ ”

KHC,Kraft Heinz,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RidXNpbmVzc25ld3MubmV0L2FydGljbGVzLzE3OTIwLXNsaWRlc2hvdy10aGUtdHJlbmRzLWlnbml0aW5nLXZhbGVudGluZXMtZGF5LWlubm92YXRpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Slideshow: The trends igniting Valentine’s Day innovation | 2021-02-10,"KANSAS CITY — The COVID-19 pandemic has changed a lot of things in the past year but the role of chocolate and candy in Valentine’s Day is not one of them. According to a report from the National Confectioners Association 86% of Americans say they will share a gift of chocolate or candy this Valentine’s Day.

“Throughout the pandemic one thing that has remained consistent is that Americans appreciate chocolate and candy for the sense of comfort they bring during challenging times” said John Downs president and chief executive officer of the National Confectioners Association. “The confectionery category remains resilient as people find new and creative ways to incorporate chocolate and candy into their celebrations of holidays and special moments like Valentine’s Day.”

While consumers still plan to exchange confectionery for the holiday Valentine’s Day has nonetheless been altered by the restrictions of coronavirus. In light of this CPG manufacturers and foodservice operators alike are releasing new offerings driven by three trends that emerged in the midst of the pandemic: experimental products inclusive products and mindful products.

One experimental product debuting for Valentine’s Day is Candy Kraft Mac & Cheese from Kraft Heinz Co. The pasta includes a candy flavor packet to turn the macaroni and cheese pink and add hints of sweet candy flavor.

“Pre-COVID-19 brought us pink chocolate — a revolutionary innovation that took the industry by storm — and now after an unconventional year to say the least Kraft Heinz introduces us to pink mac and cheese” said Carmen Bryan consumer analyst at GlobalData. “Adding a sweet twist to this traditional dish has certainly raised some eyebrows worldwide but the novelty may just be what some people are looking for after a tough year of strict lockdowns.”

Sugar Lab is getting in on the experimental trend with a new line of 3D printed truffles bonbons and candies for Valentine’s Day. The Valentine's Day line features candies cupcake décor cocktail garnishes and pastry shells.

“According to GlobalData’s latest survey nearly two thirds (61%) of US consumers’ purchasing choices are always or often influenced by how enjoyable or unique a product is five percentile points higher than the global average (56%)” Ms. Bryan said. “Other manufacturers would be wise to emulate similar launches that leverage this ‘Instagrammability’ factor that can be achieved within the home space.”

Inclusive products that celebrate more than just romantic relationships also are trending for Valentine’s Day.

For example Insomnia Cookies is launching a Galentine’s Day menu for women to celebrate their friendship — with a new limited-time menu. The offerings include red velvet and chocolate covered strawberry classic and mini cookies red velvet and chocolate covered strawberry cookie dipper packs heart-shaped cookie cakes and more.

“Valentine’s Day is no longer just for significant others with the concept increasingly expanding to friendship groups and family” Ms. Bryan said.” The rise in Galentine’s Day is just one example of this.”

The Hershey Co. is introducing the Milk Chocolate Bear a limited-edition 5-oz hollow chocolate bear holding a heart that reads “beary best friends.”

“Two in five (40%) UK millennials — who largely grew up with the iconic love candy — are always or often influenced by how well a product aligns to their needs and personality” Ms. Bryan said. “Leveraging the ‘limited edition’ appeal while marketing beyond significant others makes the launch both exclusive and more inclusive tapping into consumers’ fear of missing out (FOMO) and a wider target base.”

Also popular for Valentine’s Day this year are mindful products focused on health and wellness.

Fortum & Mason brewed a special calming tea for Valentine’s Day. St Valentine’s Tea is a loose-leaf tea that marries soft white tea buds with scented rose petals and hibiscus.

“For those looking for a break from traditional tipsy celebrations Fortnum & Mason St Valentine’s Tea will make for a great sophisticated and calming occasion” Ms. Bryan said. “Consumers are increasingly demanding products that cater to both the body and mind with holistic health trends now more prominent within the industry.

“I want you to grieve but the manner of her death is irrelevant because the manner of her life was exemplary"" said Jason King Olivia King's oldest son. ""As my brother said she was at Mass that morning and every morning with our Lord and Blessed Sacrament receiving him body blood soul of our Lord and she died in a state of grace. I cannot think of a better way to go meet our Lord than my mom did. She was ready. She was prepared. And I know God will call her my good and faithful servant.”

The three brothers spoke Saturday at a funeral service for their mother at the Catholic Church of the Incarnation.

Olivia King a widowed mother of three grown sons was the only fatality out of 10 Kroger employees and 5 customers shot when a shooter began firing in a Collierville Kroger last week. The shooter also died due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

A longtime Collierville resident Olivia King had taught her children to pray and trust in God said Wes King one of her sons.

She taught them that ""family is one of the greatest gifts that God bestows on us"" he said.

Olivia King came from humble origins Wes King said born the 10th child on a ranch in Texas where her father helped oversee the work.

""They were rich in family and love and faith and a whole lot of tortillas"" he said. ""My mother was dedicated to her family growing up. Throughout her whole life she loved her brothers and sisters each one of them to the end and she loved her parents.”

She met her husband Greg when he was in flight school training and after a whirlwind yearlong romance they were married.

Her son Greg King was just 15 when his father died and Olivia King became a single mother. As he later matured and started his military career he began to realize how much he needed his mother in his life he said.

""She was always forgiving of me"" Greg King said. ""She was always patient and she was always loving.""

Sue Hornsby Oliva King's sister said she was happiest when she and her siblings could get together for dinner and share lots of laughs. She was well known for her enchiladas rice and tortillas Hornsby said.

“Her three sons were the loves of her life"" Hornsby said. ""She was extremely proud of their accomplishments and successes.""

On the day of the shooting Wes King received a phone call from a man in the Kroger who told him that his mother had been shot but was still breathing Jason King said during the funeral. The man who Jason King did not name had run to Olivia King during active gunfire and held her hand and prayed with her until the paramedics came.

Jason King asked the man to come find him saying he could think of ""no truer Christian act of charity.""

Olivia King was generous always willing to help a family member in need Hornsby said.

“May she rest in peace knowing her soul belongs to God and God only"" she said.

Progress is tracked growth is controlled and genetics are paramount. And once you've started you're hooked.

That's all according to Greg Kurkowski the new record holder for largest pumpkin grown in South Dakota.

The 65-year-old Watertown man's pumpkin weighed in at a whopping 1823 pounds on Saturday at the Great South Dakota Pumpkin Weigh-Off hosted by Riverview Tree Farm in Canton. The previous record was set in 2010 by Kevin Marsh with a pumpkin that weighed 1674 pounds.

A bit lumpier than your typical pumpkin the pale pink winner is nicknamed ""Spot.""

Stockyards Ag:T. Denny Sanford donates $1.5M for interactive plaza at Falls Park

""That's his baby"" Kirby Gardner said as he and his wife Myrna watched the giant pumpkin be weighed. The Gardeners are neighbors with Kurkowski and would often peak into the pumpkin patch during summer walks to check the massive pumpkin's progress.

But the weigh-off winner had stiff competition with other pumpkin growers also hitting high marks. They included a 1195-pound pumpkin from Watertown's Ryan Althoff. It was named ""Scarface"" for a sunburned spot on its back. Hartford's John Haar had a 688-pound pumpkin.

The smallest giant pumpkin was co-grown by Cade Kroger 3 and his sister Kate Kroger 2. It weighed 55 pounds. Instead of using the skid loader and ropes to carry their pumpkin they instead opted for their dad Travis as the pumpkin carrier.

Long-time pumpkin growing

Kurkowski grew his first giant pumpkin in 1996 and set that year's state record with a pumpkin of just 422 pounds. The next year he broke his own record with a pumpkin weighing more than 700 pounds. In 2003 Kurkowski hit 1000 pounds for the first time in his gardening career.

""From there it was fire"" he joked.

But growing a giant pumpkin isn't a feat accomplished by just any run-of-the-mill farmer. Kurkowski said it's a six-month process from start to finish.

This year the record-breaker used seeds from the Stillwater Minn. winner of the 2020 Giant Pumpkin Weigh-off which broke the Minnesota state record at 1990 pounds last year.

SD is divided by the Missouri:Drought has emphasized that for cattle ranchers.

Kurkowsi planted those Atlantic Giant pumpkin seeds on April 5 where they spent two weeks under grow lights. From there they spent about a month in a small backyard greenhouse before braving the outdoors fully.

While Kurkowski had two pumpkins growing at record pace the first split open around the 40-day mark after a hefty rain. Since you can't weigh a split pumpkin under Great Pumpkin Commonwealth rules he hauled it out of the field and focused all attention on Spot.

At its best rate of gain the pumpkin added about 45 pounds in a single day.

""Every seed — no matter what you do — is going to grow differently"" Kurkowski said. ""It's got a mind of its own.""

While each year becomes more difficult as giant pumpkin growers move more towards indoor growing Kurkowski hopes to grow three pumpkins in 2022 that weigh in at a total of at least 4000 pounds. The feat would earn him a spot in the Great Pumpkin Commonwealth's 4000-pound club and a snazzy jacket to commemorate the feat.

But until then Kurkowski plans to take this year's giant pumpkin back to Watertown where he'll haul it around town to different nursing homes and businesses for all to see.

International Game Technology Chief Operating Officer of Gaming for IGT Nick Khin and Senior Director of Core Product Roger Pettersson talk about what people can expect from their company at the Global Gaming Expo 2021 conference in Las Vegas.

If there ever was a slot machine supermarket it would be G2E.

Beginning this week gaming industry professionals will gather at The Venetian Expo to see hear and touch what gaming manufacturers say will be the next generation of casino gadgetry designed to keep players more engaged — and to spend more of their entertainment dollar.

Leaders of the American Gaming Association operators of G2E — the Global Gaming Expo — say quality not quantity will be the emphasis of this year’s show.

It’s the largest gaming trade show in the world and over the next four days buyers will be perusing the devices that promise to engage players through new technologies or experiences.

Smaller show

Knowing of the challenges of international travel during the coronavirus pandemic AGA President and CEO Bill Miller isn’t expecting that the 27000 people who usually attend G2E will all show up when the doors open Monday.

“My strong belief is that the mix of people that we have exhibiting and attending will be economically valuable and significant” Miller said in an interview.

“Measuring the success of this G2E based on numbers would not be important” he said. “What I’ve been encouraged by is that the exhibitors have been excited. It’s been two years since they’ve been able to show off in a live manner new technologies new platforms and new entertainment. That is something you can’t replicate in a Zoom call.”

And many participants agree.

“It’s a big deal this year given we didn’t have an in-person G2E last year” said Mike Gatten senior vice president of slot strategy for MGM Resorts International. “There’s something to be said for being able to have hands on and actually play the games and touch and feel and experience that stuff in a more physical environment. It is still the marquee gaming trade show and is the granddaddy of them.”

Gatten is one of those with the authority to make purchases and he and a contingent of MGM slot managers will be on the show floor that opens Tuesday seeking devices that will engage customers.

Among the features Gatten likes most about G2E is that he can comparison shop and that he also gets the chance to see offerings from smaller companies that might not be headquartered in Southern Nevada. It’s easy for him to see the newest buzzworthy machines by paying a visit to the showrooms of IGT Scientific Games Aristocrat and a host of others with a solid Las Vegas presence.

Return to normal

“It is important that G2E happen this year especially as the industry continues to be one of the leaders on health and safety measures for its guests and staff” said Brendan Bussmann director of government affairs for Las Vegas-based Global Market Advisors.

“It is time to start moving things back to normal and emerge from the great shutdown. I look forward to getting together with the colleagues that are able to make it to the show this year. It is however unfortunate that many of our international friends could not join us this year even though they were vaccinated and under the same protocols that we are here.”

Debating the issues

So G2E is a gaming industry shopping mall and a gathering place for professionals. What else?

Miller said it is an opportunity to debate industry issues and to bring in keynote speakers to discuss important topics.

“This is not a symbolic event” Miller said. “There will be conversations about industry growth including sports betting digital payments and payment modernization. The gaming industry is also a leader in inclusions and we’ll have a keynote panel dedicated to that.”

Tuesday afternoon there will be a panel on how casino companies can prioritize diversity. The three speakers are MGM Resorts International Chief People Inclusion and Sustainability Officer Jyoti Chopra; U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Suzanne Clark; and Marriott International Senior Vice President Multicultural Affairs Social Impact and Business Councils Apoorva Gandhi. MSNBC’s Contessa Brewer will moderate the discussion.

That same day Miller will deliver a state of the industry address and Gov. Steve Sisolak and Rep. Dina Titus D-Nev. will take the stage to discuss recovering from the pandemic.

A panel Wednesday will feature Brewer moderating a session with CEOs from three companies weighing in on several industry topics with MGM Resorts International’s Bill Hornbuckle and Wynn Resorts Ltd.’s Matt Maddox participating. Representing the tribal perspective will be Hard Rock International’s Jim Allen whose company is operated by Florida’s Seminole Indian Tribe.

The keynote parade will end Wednesday with Miller interacting with Arizona Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill.

“It’s a great lineup of speakers and I think it is because there’s a lot going on in the industry and clearly we’ve gone through a pretty tough 18 months” Miller said.

There may even be a celebrity or two.

“Wheel of Fortune” star Vanna White is scheduled to conduct a charity celebrity slot tournament where $15000 will go to several causes. It’s all part of IGT’s celebration of the “Wheel of Fortune” slot brand turning 25 years old this year.

‘It’s Game Time’

But in the end it’s mainly all about the massive display of new slots table games and other devices.

“Our theme is ‘It’s Game Time.’ I think it’s a really really appropriate theme for us because I think this is a really big year for products we’ll be showing” said Nick Khin IGT’s chief operating officer for gaming.

“This year’s a special year because a lot of the products and solutions we’re going to be showing are going to have a big impact on the marketplace in general over the next few years.”

Khin is expecting the company’s Diamond RS cabinet to be the talk of the show.

Diamond RS making its global debut at the show is a mechanical reel cabinet that retains player-favorite features including Diamond Glass which can overlay video elements onto the reel window.

Cabinets are a big part of IGT’s business — emphasis on “big” — with the company showing its Peak65 cabinet with a “Wheel of Fortune” game. It’s part of IGT’s Peak family of hardware in which the number represents the screen size in this case a 65-inch progressively curved display.

Meanwhile Scientific Games Corp. plans to emphasize the future of gaming with its display of iGaming content and platform with a mix of popular games its Mural and Kascada cabinets and its Player Boutique and iView player engagement systems.

“Excitement has been building for months now as our teams crafted a product lineup to showcase this year at G2E” said Barry Cottle president and CEO of Scientific. “After months of virtual gatherings we’re ready to get together safely and to show everyone what we’ve been working on.”

Company displays

Other companies have big plans.

Aristocrat Gaming will show new evolutions of its Mighty Cash Ultra 88 and Gold Stacks 88 and new innovations of Jackpot Catcher Triple Supreme and Wild Fireball Rumble.

JCM Global will show off guest experience enhancements with its DSS Flex and DSS Max R video walls secure bill validators its Gen5 thermal printers and an assortment of high-speed cash transaction systems.

Gary Platt Manufacturing will display its seating solutions to maximize guest comfort. The company delivered some of its most recent work to Resorts World Las Vegas.

“As they say ‘The show must go on.’” Bussmann said. “Now is not the time even with the current restrictions in place by the governor to push back G2E to not host meetings and conventions when they can be done in a safe environment. It’s a staple to the Las Vegas economy and the industry needs to continue its leadership to show how other sectors can follow.”

Simply sign up to the Exchange traded funds myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

Up to a quarter of the revenues generated by the constituent companies of exchange traded funds focused on US stocks are derived from sales to China according to research by Bank of America.

The analysis demonstrates how difficult it is for investors to avoid the fallout from Beijing’s crackdown on a swath of private sector activities.

“What happens in China doesn’t stay in China” BofA said with the correlation between earnings per share growth in the US S&P 500 and Chinese economic growth surging from zero in 2010 to 90 per cent exceeding the importance of US gross domestic product growth for US-listed stocks.

About 30 per cent of global GDP growth over the past two decades has come from China greater than the 21 per cent from the US while almost 80 per cent of the S&P 500’s margin expansion since 1990 has been driven by globalisation the bank added.

BofA found that 79 S&P 500 companies generate at least 5 per cent of their revenues from China a figure rising to 63 per cent for casino operator Las Vegas Sands and 70 per cent for rival Wynn Resorts both heavily focused on the Macau gaming market.

Next highest were chipmakers Qualcomm at 60 per cent and Texas Instruments (55 per cent) followed by laser developer IPG Photonics (42 per cent).

Globally it identified 303 listed companies with total market capitalisation in excess of $19tn that generate at least 5 per cent of their revenue from China.

Separate analysis by Jared Woodard head of the research investment committee at BofA found that — based on their holdings of these 303 companies — 138 of the 251 ETFs the bank covers generated at least 3 per cent of their underlying revenue from China.

Apart from China-focused funds emerging market ETFs were the most exposed with their constituents typically deriving between 25 and 45 per cent of their revenues from the country.

However even some ETFs focused purely on US-listed stocks were found to have high exposures led by the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) whose constituents generate 27.9 per cent of their revenues from China according to BofA’s numbers.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) is not far behind at 25.8 per cent with VanEck Low Carbon Energy ETF (SMOG) which tracks a global index at 19.1 per cent and the First Trust Nasdaq 100 Technology Sector Index fund (QTEC) at 16.6 per cent.

“A lot of US companies have built up quite a lot of dependence on revenues from China” Woodard said. “Investors may not be aware. People know the mandates of the funds they buy usually but what they might not know is that companies around the world have become increasingly dependent on China.”

The figures might even understate ETFs’ exposure to China. Some funds will hold companies that derive some revenue from China but less than the 5 per cent threshold used in BofA’s analysis meaning their contribution is missed. In addition not all companies disclose the full geographic breakdown of their sales Woodard said.

The research also only covered revenues emanating from China not other potential vulnerabilities such as supply chains.

“Revenue exposure is something we can measure [but] that is just one reflection of their relationship. [Via] broader trade labour pools there are a host of ways that means economies around the world are more connected than before” Woodard added.

His analysis found that some of the ETFs with little exposure to China have outperformed comparable China-centric funds by as much as 37 percentage points since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020.

The gaps are particularly large for consumer discretionary funds where some ETFs hold China-dependent casino education and luxury stocks while others do not.

The gaps are also notable for funds following an environmental social and governance mantra and those focused on emerging markets.

While every stock market has its ups and downs Woodard argued that China’s current combination of long-term concerns around issues such as demographics and potential growth cyclical headwinds such as tight monetary policy and “political interventions in the name of common prosperity” means “the risk may be greater than the rewards”.

Kenneth Lamont senior fund analyst for passive strategies at Morningstar said the analysis underscored the need for investors to be aware of what is in the funds they hold.

“The geographical location of a company is somewhat arbitrary. It’s not necessarily linked with where it makes its money. Shell and BP are listed in the UK but that’s not where the bulk of their revenues are coming from” Lamont said.

“American companies tend to have a fairly large domestic footprint because they have a large internal market but in a globalised world we are all dependent to some degree on how well China is doing.”

BofA also noted that since 2017 mutual funds had gone from having an equal weight position in the US companies with top decile exposure to China to being more than 10 percentage points underweight.

ETFs being overwhelmingly passive do not have the scope to follow suit even though these stocks trade at near-record 25 per cent premium to their peers according to BofA.

Rahul Sen Sharma managing partner of Indxx an index provider said “only time will tell” whether active managers’ decision to underweight US stocks heavily exposed to China pays off.

“We will have to see how the returns stack up over the long term. Passive investment usually wins out over active” he said.

Lamont agreed saying “next week something might change and these active managers will be caught off guard.

“Sometimes [active management] pays off and sometimes it doesn’t. Maybe it will pay off this time but most active managers don’t make enough calls right over time.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcG9ydHNrZWVkYS5jb20vcG9wLWN1bHR1cmUvc2V4LWxpZXMtbXVyZGVyLWZ1bGwtY2FzdC1saXN0LW1lZXQtbGluZHNheS1oYXJ0bGV5LWFuZHJldy1yb2dlcnMtb3RoZXJzLWxpZmV0aW1lLXRocmlsbGVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Sex Lies and Murder' full cast list: Meet Lindsay Hartley Andrew Rogers and others from Lifetime thriller,"Sex Lies and Murder is yet another gripping thriller from Lifetime that documents the repercussions of adultery. Designed to give viewers the creeps the film follows Maggie her fractured marriage and a torrid relationship outside of it.

Originally titled Deadly Seduction Sex Lies and Murder is as compelling and dramatic as some of its predecessors. Some of the binge-worthy titles include My Daughter's Deadly Date Killer Grades and Secret Life of a Student among others.

Lindsay Hartley as Maggie in Sex Lies and Murder

At 14 Hartley managed to land a theater role that springboarded her into the thick of acting. Two years later she moved to Las Vegas in hopes of making it big in showbiz. Instead she headlined as the lead vocalist at Las Vegas Sands Hotel's afternoon show Viva Las Vegas. However she made a move to New York City and performed in Broadway musicals.

Of Russian descent the actress has since dabbled in a wide range of roles - Arianna Hernandez in Days of Our Lives Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald in Passions Dr. Cara Castillo Martin in All My Children and Sam McCall in General Hospital among others.

Andrew Rogers as Kyle

Unlike his co-actor from Sex Lies and Murder Rogers is fairly new to the spotlight. Born to French and Italian parents this actor lived and grew up in between France and the US. He graduated from UC Berkeley and attended the Lycée Français La Pérouse.

He is known for his work in Dark Cycle Wicked and Mommy's Deadly Con Artist.

Sex Lies and Murder is scheduled to release on October 3 Sunday at 8:00 PM Eastern Time (ET). Directed and co-written by Tom Shell the Lifetime flick also stars Katie Jelly Brooks Ryan and Drew Pollock in key roles.

The official synopsis for Sex Lies and Murder reads:

""Maggie and her husband Richard are both college professors and have a daughter 17-year-old Jenny. Their marriage is falling apart and when Richard admits to having an affair with a student they separate. Maggie and best friend Alyssa intend to have a girls’ night out. At the bar meets Kyle handsome and charming and she revels in his attention.""

What follows next is anybody's guess. After a few drinks and a flirty sesh the two spend a night together only to realize it was a mistake. Especially Maggie who is left particularly stirred when Kyle attends one of her classes the following morning.

The building's top ten stories are earmarked for extensive public use and entertainment facilities including an observation deck and rooftop café.

The tower's uninterrupted curvature and gentle tapered form are reflective of Korean artistry. The seam that runs from top to bottom of the structure gestures toward the old center of the city.

Al-Masjid al-Ḥarām (The Forbidden Mosque) is the largest mosque in the world. Located in the city of Mecca it surrounds the Kaaba the place which Muslims worldwide turn towards while offering daily prayers and is Islam's holiest place. The mosque is also known as the Grand Mosque.

The current structure covers an area of 356800 square metres (88.2 acres) including the outdoor and indoor praying spaces and can accommodate up to four million Muslim worshippers during the Hajj period one of the largest annual gatherings of people in the world.

Islamic tradition holds that the Mosque was first built by the angels before the creation of mankind when God ordained a place of worship on Earth to reflect the house in heaven called al-Baytu l-Ma'mur (Arabic: البيت المعمور ""The Worship Place of Angels""). From time to time the Mosque was damaged by a storm (flood) and was rebuilt anew. According to Islamic belief it was built by Ibrahim (Abraham) with the help of his son Ismail (Ishmael). They were ordered by Allah to build the mosque and the Kaaba. The Black Stone is situated near the eastern corner of the Kaaba believed to be the only remnant of the original structure made by Abraham. The Kaaba is the direction for all the Muslims to pray across the globe thus signifying unity among all. The Islamic teaching specifically mentions that nothing is miraculous about the Grand Mosque except for the oasis Zamzam which has purportedly never dried ever since it was revealed.",,,

The indie rocker has released a cover of Bo Burnham's song ""That Funny Feeling"" from his Netflix special Inside which Bridgers has been performing on tour recently. The song is available to purchase exclusively on Bandcamp with proceeds supporting various Texas abortion funds.

""This one's for Greg Abbott"" Bridgers said in a statement referring to the Texas governor who signed the nation's most restrictive abortion legislation into law earlier this year. The law bans all abortions after six weeks and allows private citizens to sue abortion providers in Texas. Under the statue citizens can also sue anyone providing support for an abortion including family members and friends of a patient and even ride-share or taxi drivers who provide transportation to an abortion clinic.

""That Funny Feeling"" explores the feelings of anxiety and alienation created by modern society particularly the internet and online discourse. It's one of several songs Burnham penned and performed for Inside which he created entirely in self-isolation during the pandemic and released on Netflix to widespread acclaim in May.

Burnham recently won three Emmys for Inside including Outstanding Music Direction and Outstanding Writing and Directing for a Variety Special. Bridgers meanwhile is currently touring in support of her 2020 album Punisher which received a Grammy nomination for Best Alternative Music Album earlier this year.

The Pussycat Doll vocalist 43 opted for the strappy two-piece for her latest trip to the Caribbean.

6 The star drove fans wild with her latest snaps from her Caribbean holiday

In a trio of snaps she left her hair in loose waves and wore minimal make-up bar a pink gloss.

The star wrote on Instagram: ""Swipe for the full body experience 👌🏽☺️""

She also shared a racy TikTok video and mimed to fellow American popstar Taylor Swift's track Wildest Dreams before flashing a dramatic pout to the camera.

The Don't Cha singer then panned the camera around to capture the stunning seaside scenery in the background.

After posting the clip to her Instagram page she added the caption: ""Canouan I’m here 🏝✨ @trendingtravel.co.uk @mo_canouan #canouan.""

Canouan is an island in St Vincent and the Grenadines and if its anything like the star's other holidays fans will be able to keep up to date on her antics on her social media.

Nicole is often seen accompanied by boyfriend Thom Evans as they share their romantic sun-soaked adventures with the world.

LEGAL SPAT

Nicole announced in November 2019 that she was reuniting with Ashley Roberts 39 Jessica Sutta 39 Kimberly Wyatt 39 and Carmit Bachar 47 for a tour across the UK and Australia nine years after they split.

They also released single React which became their first Top 40 hit in 11 years.

But Nicole has now said the tour is “impossible” after a huge fall-out with the band’s founder Robin Antin 60 who is suing the singer for “extortion”.

She alleges that Nicole is refusing to take part in the reunion unless she gets a larger share in the group’s latest business venture PCD Worldwide.

The company was intended to manage the band’s brand into the future and could have included the launch of their own dance studio and a “next generation” spin-off version of the Dolls featuring new singers.

Robin claims Nicole is demanding her 49 per cent holding in the firm is increased to 75 per cent giving her creative control of the group and “final decision-making authority”.

'LUDICROUS AND FALSE'

According to the lawsuit filed by Robin Nicole said the “growth of her personal brand” and the “opportunities she would have to forego to engage in the partnership” was why she deserved an increased share.

However in a fiery retaliation yesterday former X Factor judge Nicole issued a statement through her lawyer Howard King in which she branded Robin’s claims as “ludicrous and false”.

The statement continued that the accusations “Are a desperate attempt to divert blame for her [Robin’s] own failures by trying to impose obligations on Nicole that simply do not exist”.

The Sun can reveal that at the centre of the row is a payment of $600000 (£435000) paid by concert promoter Live Nation to Robin.

The money is believed to have originally been handed to her to reunite the girls on stage for a series of concerts in Las Vegas — although it has been alleged that the group had not known about this deal before Robin agreed to it.

Those gigs never took place though the girls eventually agreed to a tour instead.

But with the tour now not happening Robin must return the £435000.

She is taking Nicole to court for the cash blaming her for the collapse of the deal.

Nicole says she was unaware of the payment when Robin first accepted it.

The singer’s lawyer said: “Robin will fail in her efforts to trade on Nicole’s hard-earned success to pull herself out of a deep financial hole she has created by her own poor business and professional decisions.

“Prior to Nicole’s involvement trading on Nicole’s name without her consent Robin borrowed (and spent) $600000 from Live Nation that she won’t or can’t repay.

“Nicole has invested her own funds in excess of $150000 in support of a potential Pussycat Dolls reunion that has now been made impossible by Robin’s actions (including the public release of the group members’ confidential financial information).

“Nicole loves and respects the Pussycat Dolls fans and hopes to one day be back on stage performing the group’s amazing hits for them.

“Sadly this will not happen under these circumstances.”

DOLL DRAMA

The other Dolls singers have so far stayed silent on the matter although they are believed to be upset about the fallout following hundreds of hours of preparation and build-up to the reunion and tour.

When the band announced their return they did performances on The X Factor and Ant & Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway to promote the tour which was due to kick off in May 2020.

That was then delayed to the autumn because of the pandemic and then again to May 2021 failing to take place for a third time due to the continuing restrictions.

But the gigs now appear doomed. Paying customers are expected to receive a refund because of the stalemate between Nicole and Robin who owns the rights to the group.

It also means planned new music which Nicole spent time working on last year will not be released by the group.

The singer who is dating former Scotland rugby player Thom Evans 36 had been due to bank the biggest amount from the reunion.

Legal documents show she stood to take a 32.5 per cent share of the net profits from the tour.

Founder Robin along with Dolls Ashley Jessica and Kimberly would each have received 12.5 per cent of the takings.

Final member Carmit who returned despite quitting the group in 2008 before their second album was in line to bank five per cent.

Robin founded the Pussycat Dolls as a burlesque troupe in 1995.

They evolved into a pop group almost a decade later. They burst into the charts in 2005 with debut single Don’t Cha going straight to No1. It stayed for three weeks.

They have since scored eight Top Ten hits sold more than 55million records worldwide and collaborated with the likes of Will.i.am Busta Rhymes Snoop Dogg and Missy Elliott.

Their success also helped launch Nicole’s solo career which has seen her have a string of hit singles star in the musical Cats on the West End bank millions as a judge on shows including The X Factor and The Masked Singer USA and voice a character in 2016 Disney movie Moana.

Since their split other members of the band have told about the difficult conditions they were made to work under.

Now they are moving forward with plans to construct another factory building near their offices and AstroTech.

Lockheed Martin built the STAR Center to support the production of Orion capsules for NASA‘s Artemis program. This facility is located just across the Indian River from Kennedy Space Center. A little further inland lies the Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company office building. Lockheed Martin is getting prepared to construct a new factory-type building just south of their office. Referred to as Building 819 this facility will sit next to an existing office building and warehouse.

The plans show this area being developed in two phases. The first phase involves creating a parking lot. Satellite imagery shows construction has already begun on the area for this phase; this looks to have started in late June.

Phase two will see the construction of the factory building alongside some additional parking.

It is not known what this facility will be used for at this time. Given its proximity to the Lockheed Space Systems office and the new STAR Center it could support Orion or other Lockheed Martin spacecraft. The new STAR Center will work directly with the Lockheed Martin operations going on at the Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Facility at KSC. The STAR Center will provide the following:

Assembly and test of Orion aeroshell heat shield and backshell panels

Crew module and crew module adapter wire harness fabrication and testing

Propulsion and environmental control and life support systems assembly and testing

Electrical ground support equipment protection

The STAR Center exists in what was previously the Astronaut Experience attraction. They gutted the building and outfitted it with the following:

Class 7 clean room

Proof pressure cell for testing spacecraft readiness

9k sqft high bay with overhead gantry crane

Newly constructed machine shop

Lockheed Martin's notoriously-secretive Skunk Works boss won't comment on a video that shows an enormous saucer-like object parked at a Lockheed testing facility.

A video posted on Twitter showed the sleek and aerodynamic object being pulled on the back of a flatbed trailer in the Mohave Desert.

It was likely spotted in Lockhead's Helendale Radar Cross Section Facility said Twitter user Ruben Hofs who analyzed the video.

Social media users went wild trying to solve the mystery but they weren't about to get any clues from Skunk Works general manager Jeff Babione who was asked to comment on it during a recent Defense One interview.

'I can't' speak about it Baboine said with a smile.

He added that the facility's security protocols were 'in good shape.'

A Twitter video showed a flatbed towing an object at a top-secret Lockheed Martin facility

It was likely spotted in Lockhead's Helendale Radar Cross Section Facility said Twitter user Ruben Hofs who posted and analyzed the video which he shared September 22

A video showing the apparent aircraft generated plenty of buzz on TikTok and Twitter where it was posted September 22.

'It's a demonstration model for the shape and/or possibly the skin material' said one user. 'Probably not functional or even final design. The giant pedestal mount bottom center will be where it's secured so that it can be tested for stealth capabilities.

'Looks cool.'

Hofs posted this composite image indicating where he believes the aircraft was spotted

Others wondered how someone managed to film the object in such a heavily-monitored military compound and questioned the wisdom of sharing it with the world.

'Someone so grossly in violation of [operational security] needs to be sent to Florence Colorado for an extended vacation' tweeted Ben Sharp.

'We used to call this espionage as in 20 to life.'

The poster might have been referring to a U.S. maximum state penitentiary near Florence Colorado which is classified as a super-maximum lockup.

Social media users were curious to learn how someone managed to film the object at the top-secret military compound

Sharp added: 'If this IS a top secret project why and how is the government allowing folks running around with cellphones to take photos of it and post them in the clear? I am as fascinated to see this as the next person but neither I nor anyone should see it so freely.'

At the CZM committee’s meeting on Aug. 31 attorney Kevin Rames representing Lockheed Martin expressed concerns about the modifications.

Trinity Austrie and Benjamin Keularts from Tysam Tech an environmental firm representing Diageo said the 10-acre lined evaporation pond will be a key component of the existing wash water treatment system. The pond will be used to responsibly manage any treated bio-condensate that is not re-used at the facility and a continuous small stream of wastewater resulting from the site’s reverse osmosis systems and unit blowdowns they said.

“Last time we left with CZM giving Diageo USVI some time in order to gather their corporate documents and since then they were able to incorporate some feedback received from CZM and Lockheed Martin” Austrie said.

Lockheed Martin has been remediating the St. Croix Renaissance Group LLC property under the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the district of St. Croix. The remediation was ordered as part of a lawsuit filed by the Department of Planning and Natural Resources against Lockheed Martin and others who Rames has defended.

One of the concerns was a six-foot separation between the berm in what is referenced as “Area B” and the berm to be constructed by Diageo. Lockheed Martin requested a 10-foot separation between Lockheed Martin’s berm and the evaporation pond. Austrie said that Diageo USVI has looked at the redesign and has considered the 10-foot spacing as Lockheed Martin requested.

“Consideration came with the redesign to make sure that we can still capture the 400 feet required for capturing the aeration from the sprayers” Austrie said.

Diageo USVI did decrease the size of the pond but said it was still able to maintain 400 feet.

To minimize the hydraulic retention time that would be required for evaporation 18 mechanical sprayers will be installed to enhance the evaporative process. The sprayer design chosen is the SMI Model 420F sprayer that disperses the aerated liquid up to 25 feet in the air and drift in worst-case conditions would be approximately 400 feet according to Tysam Tech.

The sprayer layout positioning and volume will allow drift control even during heavy winds. The pond design allows for the containment of a 1000-year storm as well as an additional freeboard of three feet. The liquid depth of Diageo’s process water is limited to no more than 4.6 feet. The system does not require water and can operate on a continuous basis to control odors from the pond according to Tysam Tech.

“The maximum flow rate to be discharged to the pond will be 210 gallons per minute” Austrie said.

The total evaporation system manages as much as 230 gallons per minute without increasing the depth of the liquid level in the pond Austrie said.

The CZM committee also requested the installation of infrastructure in the pipeline to have community access for material going off the pond for potential reuse and agriculture.

“Diageo is committed to installing an infrastructure along the pipeline leading to the pond so that farmers and others can have access to the non-hazardous material” Austrie said.

During the questions portion of Thursday’s meeting Kai Nielsen asked if anything would affect the slight decrease in the size to the pond. Austrie replied “No.”

A representative from Lockheed Martin was present but said that they were only there to observe.

Committee members present were Chairwoman Masserae Sprauve-Webster Kai Nielsen and Carl Simmonds Charles Peters was absent and excused.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL3VzLW5hdnktYXdhcmRzLWxvY2toZWVkLW1hcnRpbi10cmlkZW50LWlpLXN1Yi1iYWxsaXN0aWMtbWlzc2lsZXMv0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXVyYXNpYW50aW1lcy5jb20vdXMtbmF2eS1hd2FyZHMtbG9ja2hlZWQtbWFydGluLXRyaWRlbnQtaWktc3ViLWJhbGxpc3RpYy1taXNzaWxlcy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gone ‘Berserk’ In 2016 US Navy Awards Lockheed Martin Contract To Produce Trident II Sub-Launched Ballistic Missiles,"The US Navy has awarded Lockheed Martin Space a $445 million contract to produce Trident II submarine-launched nuclear ballistic missiles the US Defense Department said in a press release.

“Lockheed Martin Space Titusville Florida is awarded a $445488793 fixed-price incentive cost-plus-incentive-fee and cost-plus-fixed-fee modification to a previously awarded and announced unpriced letter contract for Trident II missile production and deployed systems support” the release said on Friday.

Work on the contract is expected to be completed by September 2026 the release said. The release did not detail the number of Trident II missiles that will be built.

Earlier this year the US had successfully tested an unarmed life-extended Trident II (D5LE) ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead the US Navy said. According to the statement the missile was launched from the Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine USS Maine (SSBN-741) off the coast of San Diego California.

“Today’s scheduled test validated performance expectations of the life-extended Trident II (D5LE) Strategic Weapon System (SWS) and gathered additional data on the SWS’ reliability accuracy and performance factors. This launch marks 178 successful missile launches of the Trident II (D5 &D5LE) strategic weapon system” the statement said.

Trident II Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles

The Trident II strategic weapon system originally designed with a life span to 2024 recently underwent a life extension that will keep it operational through the late 2040s according to the US Navy.

Submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) – Trident II comprise about 70 percent of the US nuclear deterrent which also includes the US Air Force’s intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear-capable bombers.

In 2016 the missile test was in the ‘line of fire’ as it failed and went wayward. Instead of its intended route towards the US mainland the missile went in the completely opposite direction and was blown up midair using the self-destruct feature.

The test was conducted by the British Royal Navy. The issue is that when HMS Vengeance test-fired the missile off the coast of Florida the missile was not out by a few meters but several thousand miles. It had been targeted at the southern Atlantic off the coast of West Africa. Instead it was traveling in the opposite direction over the US British media – The Guardian reported.

The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) for many years has been struggling to develop technology that can find track target and explode an incoming intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) traveling through space. It has been focused on achieving this feat because America's potential adversaries employ sophisticated decoys and countermeasures.

An ICBM can travel with phony missile decoys or travel amid space debris and clutter. These factors can disrupt the targeting sensors of a kill vehicle sent to intercept and destroy an ICBM. This is why the MDA and defense industry have been redesigning seekers kill vehicles guidance technology and targeting systems to ensure that an ICBM's interceptors can make discernments that allow them to find and eliminate the correct target.

These factors form the essential conceptual basis upon which the MDA has launched its Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) program a technical effort to engineer new missile defense systems capable of replacing and moving beyond the existing Ground-Based Interceptor. The program has been underway for several years. It calls for a next-generation technology better positioned to track and destroy incoming ICBM threats expected in 2030 and beyond.

The MDA has awarded several developmental deals to various defense industry teams including a Lockheed Martin-Aerojet team and a Northrop Grumman-Raytheon team. Both are competing for the opportunity to produce and deliver the NGI. While much of the specifics are likely proprietary or unavailable for security reasons new NGIs are likely to operate with multiple kill vehicles meaning a single interceptor will operate and release several actual interceptors that collide with and destroy multiple threats. This technique which defense industry contractors have been developing over the years enables a weapon to detect threats from decoys and countermeasures while firing multiple interceptors at a volley of enemy ICBMs traveling through the air.

A Lockheed Martin press statement highlights some of the challenges associated with the existing Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system. It notes that the existing GBI is obsolete and as with any weapon there is a limit or point at which a legacy system can no longer be upgraded to keep pace with existing threats.

“While recent tests demonstrate the promise of the system the interceptor has reached a point where it can no longer be simply updated to meet the demand” according to the Lockheed press statement.

“There’s a feeling that perhaps justice will be served” said Lowe’s older brother Christopher Jackson. “We are still at a loss as to why.”

READ: SLC Police arrest suspect in Aaron Lowe murder

Regardless of the major step in Lowe’s case Jackson said an arrest won’t bring his little brother back.

“We want to get to a place where our hearts are not hurting or hardened” he said.

Jackson is 16 years older than Lowe. He’s been by his side through it all.

“It’s almost as if Aaron’s my child” he said. “It really has affected me. It’s as if a part of me is gone.”

Jackson said the news of the arrest initially angered him but once he learned of Buk M. Buk’s criminal past he’s now left feeling “ambivalent.”

“It just left me to ask a lot of questions in terms of what types of intervention were in place that could have prevented his from happening” he said.

As the investigation continues the family hopes to learn more about what led up to the shooting and why Lowe.

“We know the type of individual that Aaron was and he wasn’t deserving of that” said Jackson. “I think we’ll always have the question of ‘Why?’”

Instead of getting caught up in questions that may never get answered Jackson said he plans to direct his energy toward remembering the good and advocating against violence.

“When I tell you he was one of the purest spirits you would ever meet… We are proud that when he left our community he continued to show forth the things that he was taught” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL2NvbGxlZ2UtZm9vdGJhbGwvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zMjMyOTg5NS9tYW4tY2hhcmdlZC1tdXJkZXItc2hvb3RpbmctZGVhdGgtdXRhaC1mb290YmFsbC1wbGF5ZXItYWFyb24tbG93ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man charged with murder in shooting death of Utah football player Aaron Lowe,"A 22-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the shooting death of Utah football player Aaron Lowe Salt Lake City police announced Sunday.

Buk M. Buk has been charged with aggravated murder attempted murder and felony discharge of a firearm.

Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown did not discuss a motive and declined to answer questions from reporters during a news conference Sunday. But he did say the shooting was not a targeted attack on the university its athletic department or Lowe nor was it gang-related.

Lowe 21 was shot early on Sept. 26 at a house party in the Sugar House neighborhood of Salt Lake City. A 20-year-old woman also shot in the incident remains in critical condition after undergoing extensive surgery.

Police arrested Buk in Draper Utah early Sunday.

""In a time of need we turned to our community"" Brown said in a statement prior to the news conference. ""We asked people to come forward and to share the information they had. Because of those tips and the unrelenting pursuit of justice from our homicide detectives we have arrested the person accused of murdering Aaron Lowe. So many lives have been impacted from this senseless shooting.""

Lowe was a sophomore cornerback from Mesquite Texas. He was close with Utah running back Ty Jordan who died in an accidental shooting in December and in August became the first recipient of the Ty Jordan Memorial Scholarship.

Utah Jazz star Donovan Mitchell wore No. 22 at practice Saturday in honor of Lowe and Jordan.

With a chance to pitch his team into the postseason Yankees starter Jordan Montgomery instead was rocked for a career-worst seven earned runs in 2 2/3 innings. He gave up a pair of three-run homers to Lowe who also went deep in the seventh against Michael King.

Even with the embarrassing defeat before a booing Yankee Stadium crowd of 41648 New York could still punch its postseason ticket Saturday with losses by Toronto and Seattle. By the time the Yankees had finished their postgame interviews though the Blue Jays had built a huge lead late in their game against last-place Baltimore.

A victory in the scheduled regular-season finale Sunday against Tampa Bay would guarantee the streaky Yankees an AL wild card.

“We’ve got to win. It’s as simple as that” veteran outfielder Brett Gardner said. “Here we are going into Game 162 not knowing what the future is.

“It’s not ideal. But it’s nice knowing that we still have a chance” he added. “The way the season has gone it kind of makes sense that it would come down to the very last day. Seems about right.”

New York is assured at least a tiebreaker game Monday that could put the team in the playoffs for the fifth straight season. But after dropping the first two games of this series the Yankees no longer control their own destiny to host the wild-card game. Now they need a Boston loss to do so.

New York began the day with a one-game lead over the Red Sox for the league’s top wild card. Boston was playing at Washington.

“Just a bad day for us and we’ve got to get over it quickly” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.

Lowe batted in the eighth with an opportunity to match the major league record of four home runs in a game. He evaded a 93 mph fastball from Joely Rodriguez that was way inside then grounded out to first base.

Lowe and Mike Zunino homered back-to-back off Montgomery (6-7) in the third to make it 7-1. Austin Meadows added a three-run shot in the seventh as the AL East champion Rays (100-61) reached 100 wins for the first time in team history.

Tampa Bay which has already wrapped up home-field advantage throughout the American League playoffs had never before been 39 games over .500.

Zunino Randy Arozarena and Wander Franco had three hits apiece for the Rays who outhit New York 19-4.

Luis Patino (5-3) worked two hitless innings for the win.

Montgomery’s shortest outing this season marked an untimely end to a strong stretch.

The left-hander had permitted no more than one run in three straight starts and nine of his past 11 going 3-1 with a 2.26 ERA during that span. He was 1-0 with a 1.65 ERA and 22 strikeouts over 16 1/3 innings in his past three outings and had allowed three earned runs or fewer in 15 of his last 16 starts since June 20.

“Nobody’s perfect. They’re going to happen” he said. “Just got to be better next time.”

Lowe has gone deep in his past three games and his career-high seven RBIs gave him 99 this season. He increased his career-best total to a team-leading 39 homers with his first three-homer game in the majors. It was his sixth career multihomer game and fourth this year.

Anthony Rizzo homered for the Yankees and Gio Urshela had an RBI triple.

TRAINER’S ROOM

Rays: With manager Kevin Cash looking to rest 1B Ji-Man Choi and INF Joey Wendle catcher Francisco Mejía made his first career start at first base.

Yankees: 3B DJ LeMahieu missed his second consecutive game with a sports hernia that will require offseason surgery but the two-time batting champion will attempt to play through the injury in October. He received a cortisone injection Friday and the team hopes he can return to the lineup Sunday ... 1B Luke Voit probably will be sidelined for at least a couple of weeks with left knee inflammation. Voit placed on the 10-day injured list Thursday could potentially return later in October if the Yankees advance deep enough in the postseason Boone said.

ROSTER MOVES

Rays: Recalled RHP Chris Mazza from Triple-A Durham and optioned RHP Louis Head who stayed with the big league team on the taxi squad.

Yankees: Recalled infielder Andrew Velazquez from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and optioned reliever Albert Abreu to their top farm club. Velazquez started at shortstop and Urshela shifted back to third base his natural position.

UP NEXT

RHP Michael Wacha (3-5 5.26 ERA) pitches the regular-season finale Sunday for Tampa Bay. New York had not announced a starter — Jameson Taillon (right ankle) is an option after throwing a successful bullpen Friday. Gerrit Cole on three days’ rest could also be in the mix. “I don’t know. We’ll talk about it” Boone said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8va3V0di5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9wb2xpY2UtYXJyZXN0LXN1c3BlY3QtaW4tbXVyZGVyLW9mLXUtb2YtdS1mb290YmFsbC1wbGF5ZXItYWFyb24tbG93ZdIBZGh0dHBzOi8va3V0di5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvcG9saWNlLWFycmVzdC1zdXNwZWN0LWluLW11cmRlci1vZi11LW9mLXUtZm9vdGJhbGwtcGxheWVyLWFhcm9uLWxvd2U?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Police arrest suspect in murder of U of U football player Aaron Lowe,"Salt Lake Police arrested a suspect for the murder of University of Utah football player Aaron Lowe.

Good Knights of Lorain County partnered with Lowe’s Hero to build fifty beds to benefit local children.

The construction took place on Oct. 2 from 10 a.m. until 1 p.m. in Lowe’s parking lot 646 Midway Blvd. in Elyria

Although Good Knights of Lorain County has only been an official organization since August 2020 they have provided approximately 350 beds for youngsters between ages 3 and eighteen.

Roger Dorsey Executive Director of Good Knights says Lowe’s sponsored this specific bed build project.

“These beds are being sponsored by Lowe’s here in Elyria so the majority of them will go to kids that actually live in the city” he said. “They have helped us beyond measure.”

Brittany Roberts Manager of Lowe’s Elyria says they look forward to positively impacting the community.

“Lowe’s of Elyria is happy to fund another bed build event for our community” Roberts said. “We are thankful for the partnership with Good Knights of Lorain County and look forward to helping local families in need.”

The volunteer crew assisted building the bed frames which would then be supplemented with mattresses sheets and pillows.

Dorsey says the amount of community assistance shows the heart of the people.

“It shows the desire of the general citizens in Lorain County to want to help” he said. “We have volunteers from businesses churches and some people saw us out here and wanted to join.”

As a child Dorsey said when he moved to Ohio from West Virginia he experienced being bedless as well.

“I was one of these kids who had to sleep on the floor” Dorsey said. “We lived with nine people in a three bedroom house and generally every night my bed was in the closet on a pile of clothes.

“I know what these kids go through and want to give them a foundation for a good night’s rest.”

Dorsey says the mission is more important now than ever in the wake of novel coronavirus pandemic.

“We want to get as many kids in beds so that no matter what happens they have a safe space in their homes” he said.

The beds constructed will be delivered within a week or so Dorsey said.

“We will continue going forward until we end child bedlessness here in Lorain County.”

LULU,Lululemon Athletica,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvd2h5LXlvdXJlLXNtYXJ0LXRvLWJ1eS1sdWx1bGVtb24tMjAyMS0xMC0wMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why You're Smart to Buy Lululemon,"Having pioneered the popular athleisure category Lululemon (NASDAQ: LULU) has become a name synonymous with high-quality comfortable and aesthetically pleasing clothing. So it's no surprise the stock has been a major winner too crushing the S&P 500's performance over the past five years

But investors who are still on the sidelines have nothing to worry about. Thanks to its steady momentum and some key advantages this leading apparel stock still has lots of room to run. Read on to find out why Lululemon still makes a solid investment today.

Strong momentum

During the fiscal second quarter Lululemon's revenue grew 61% year over year to $1.45 billion and operating income jumped 134% to $291 million. The business was adversely affected in 2020 by temporary store closures due to the coronavirus pandemic. But Lululemon has since recovered as consumers seek out comfortable and stylish clothing to wear not just at home but as they return to the office as well.

Lululemon's original target market was women. However its men's business is booming registering annualized revenue growth of 31% over the past two years outpacing the women's category during that period. And as part of its international expansion Lululemon plans to open 35 to 40 new stores this fiscal year and this push remains a huge focus for management. For all of fiscal 2020 just 14% of revenue came from outside North America.

""This year we will likely achieve the goal we set to double our men's business and we remain on track to quadruple our international business by 2023 if not sooner"" CEO Calvin McDonald said on the second-quarter earnings call. Since it can tap into new customer groups and new geographies it's clear Lululemon's growth is far from over. Plus the $500 million purchase of Mirror last year gives the company access to the burgeoning at-home fitness market.

Management raised its full-year fiscal 2021 guidance which now calls for sales and earnings to hit $6.23 billion and $7.21 per share at the midpoints of their respective ranges. The market was very pleased with the second-quarter results as shares popped more than 10% following the report. The business has a lot going for it so it's not out of the question that Lululemon continues surprising the market which will only propel the stock higher.

Distinct advantages

Lululemon's remarkable success can be attributed to two main factors.

First the company sells its merchandise primarily on its own website or through its global footprint of 534 stores. Direct-to-consumer (e-commerce) revenue represented 41% of total sales in the most recent quarter down from 61% in the year-ago period. This distribution strategy allows Lululemon to avoid costly markdowns further supporting the strength of the brand with consumers. It's also why Lululemon has consistently produced a higher gross margin than bigger rivals like Nike.

And when it comes to marketing Lululemon doesn't pursue expensive endorsement deals with superstar athletes. Instead it focuses on something called community-based marketing.

The company recruits ambassadors usually fitness or yoga instructors from communities where its stores are located. These ambassadors gain access to new product releases and help create valuable word-of-mouth advertising using a bottom-up localized approach. It's clearly working wonders as evidenced by the fact Lululemon has some of the highest sales-per-square-foot numbers in the retail industry.

If you're worried that you might be late to the Lululemon party think again. This fast-growing consumer brand is shaking things up in the crowded apparel market by doing things its own way. Buying the stock now could be a very smart move.

The Phoenix Suns have filled their coaching vacancy.

Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium reported that the franchise has agreed to a five-year deal worth more than $50 million with Mike Budenholzer.

Budenholzer has been named NBA Coach of the Year twice in his career and has an overall record of 484-317. The Suns will be his third spot as he previously spent time with the Milwaukee Bucks and Atlanta Hawks.

In that role with Milwaukee he saw Giannis Antetokounmpo win two MVP awards and saw other players like Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday play major roles on contending teams. In Phoenix he will have a similar situation to handle.

VA improperly approved almost $11M in bonuses to senior executives watchdog says

Department of Veterans Affairs officials improperly approved nearly $11 million in bonuses to senior executives intended for other workers a department watchdog said in a new report.

The money was recently allocated by Congress and intended to be used to recruit ""critical skill"" employees but ended up in the hands of senior executives in the VA's central Washington office according to an inspector general's report posted Thursday.

The funds authorized by the Pact Act were meant to be incentives in hiring and retaining specialists needed to process billion in new benefits for veterans dealing with health issues from being exposed to burn pits. Agent Orange and other toxic hazards.

The IG report said the money was paid instead as bonuses to more than 180 senior executives last year with several taking home more than $100000.

The average bonus paid out was over $55000 the report said.

The Washington Post first reported the results of the inspector general's investigation.

The IG said the improperly approved bonuses were due in part to breakdowns in leadership and controls at multiple levels of the VA.

The IG recommended the ""Secretary of Veterans Affairs or his designee takes appropriate action to determine whether individuals involved in the decision-making process ... had any actual or apparent conflicts of interest and develop a process to ensure all decision-makers are free from conflicts when awarding future incentives.""

When Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough in September ordered the executives to return the money most did or agreed to do so but 19 have challenged having to repay the bonuses the IG report said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS9leHhvbm1vYmlsLXBoaWxhZGVscGhpYS1qdXJ5LWJlbnplbmUtYXdhcmQtMjAyNDA1MTAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philadelphia jury awards former mechanic $725.5M in Exxon Mobil case,"A Philadelphia jury sided against Exxon Mobil Corp. and awarded $725.5 million on Thursday to a former Pennsylvania man who contended he suffered from leukemia due to benzene exposure during his work starting in the 1970s as an auto mechanic and gas station attendant.

The award in Common Pleas Court was sizable for a suit filed by a single plaintiff not part of a class-action suit.

“The jury recognized that it was a wrong thing for Mobil Oil to knowingly have what they knew to cause cancer in a product that people had to use in the workplace in their vehicles and just in their daily lives and not tell the public” said Andrew DuPont attorney for Paul and Diane Gill who filed suit against Texas-based Exxon Mobil in 2020.

Exxon Mobil said it would appeal the verdict.

“This is an irrational verdict that we will ask the court to reverse before it becomes final” the company said in a statement e-mailed to The Inquirer. “Beyond that request we plan to exhaust all available appeals and are confident an appellate court will see the verdict for what it is. We are reviewing our next steps.”

DuPont an attorney with Philadelphia-based Locks Law Firm said Paul Gill’s work exposed him to benzene-containing products such as solvents degreasers oils and gasoline.

According to the suit Gill worked at an ARCO station in Painted Post N.Y. in 1974; an auto garage in Hamilton Valley Pa. from 1975 to 1980; and at a dairy farm in Lindley N.Y. from 1986 to 1994. Those jobs took place before Exxon and Mobil merged in 1999.

The suit said Gill worked directly and indirectly on a near daily basis with those products exposing him to benzene xylene toluene and other chemical compounds.

Gill now 67 was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 2019. He suffered multiple symptoms and side effects as the result of the AML and treatments. The suit said the cancer was the “proximate result of his exposure to the defendants’ benzene-containing products and the defendants’ wrongful conduct.”

AML starts in the bone marrow and often quickly moves into the blood according to the American Cancer Society. It can spread to other parts of the body including the lymph nodes liver spleen central nervous system and testicles.

The suit said that benzene had been known to cause cancer before 1964 and that there is no safe level of exposure. It accused Exxon Mobil of gross negligence saying the company knew or should have known that people working with or in close proximity to benzene-related products could suffer from “blood and bone marrow poisoning and damage damage to DNA chromosome damage cancer leukemia and other blood and bone marrow disease and damage.”

The suit also said that Gill did not know the “nature and extent of danger” he had exposed himself to over decades working as a mechanic or at service stations. But it said Exxon Mobil was aware and continued to make market and sell products with benzene without warning people who used those products or put controls in place. Benzene-containing products should have come with warnings instructions and training the suit said.

Gill’s illness “caused him pain suffering disability disfigurement deformity impairment mental anguish anxiety humiliation and increased susceptibility to infection” the suit said preventing him “from engaging in those activities from which he derives life’s pleasures.”

Gill’s wife Diane was awarded $500000.

Other attorneys representing Gill during the trial included Patrick Wigle and Rajeev Mittal of Dallas-based Waters Kraus Paul & Siegel.

In a similar case in Connecticut last year a jury reached the opposite conclusion and ruled in favor of Exxon Mobil in a lawsuit brought by a widow who sought $40 million for her husband’s injuries and eventual death from AML according to the Hartford Business Journal. The husband Nicholas Yoranidis owned an Exxon Mobil gas station. Jurors there found his widow had failed to prove the products were defective or establish a connection to Nicholas Yoranidis’ condition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2F0aGxldGljcy9kb2hhLWRpYW1vbmQtbGVhZ3VlLTIwMjQtbmVlcmFqLWNob3ByYS1saXZlLWtpc2hvcmUtamVuYS1saXZlLXVwZGF0ZXMtNTYzMzE0M9IBdWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2F0aGxldGljcy9kb2hhLWRpYW1vbmQtbGVhZ3VlLTIwMjQtbmVlcmFqLWNob3ByYS1saXZlLWtpc2hvcmUtamVuYS1saXZlLXVwZGF0ZXMtNTYzMzE0My9hbXAvMQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Doha Diamond League 2024 Highlights: Neeraj Chopra Finishes 2nd With 88.36m Throw,"Live Updates: Neeraj Chopra to compete in India after this

Qu Jing a vice president at Chinese search giant Baidu was seen shouting at a colleague struggling with a recent breakup: “I’m not your mother-in-law. I’m not your mom. I only care about your results” The Wall Street Journal earlier reported.

In other videos — most of them posted on TikTok’s sister platform in China Douyin — Qu bashed a subordinate for not wanting to work weekends and dismissed a complaint that her late-night work messages kept up one of her employee’s crying children.

4 Qu Jing a vice president at Baidu was fired after a series of viral social media videos showed her bashing a subordinate for not wanting to work weekends. Baidu

“Why should it be my business that your child was crying?” she said in another highly circulated clip seen by The Journal.

In yet another bizarre video posted to X Qu — who previously headed public relations for fellow Chinese tech giant Huawei — was seen beating a paper cutout of a person with a white piece of rope.

The stick figure donned the letters “SCMP” below drawings of knives allegedly representing the China Morning Post — which had posted a piece of negative news about the exec according to the account that posted the footage Asia Tech.

As the footage went viral and Qu faced a tide of backlash she replaced the videos on her own Douyin account with an apology video saying she had tried to do a good job but lacked patience and therefore failed to adopt “a proper approach” at managing others according to The Journal.

Baidu’s chief executive Robin Li has reportedly been furious at Qu since Thursday when public outrage skyrocketed The Journal reported.

He has since fired Qu.

Qu’s comments in the workplace were “inappropriate and didn’t represent and reflect the real culture and values of Baidu” people familiar with the matter told The Journal noting that the company’s management has since agreed to review its corporate culture.

In a statement released Friday Baidu’s head of human resources admitted that the firm has its internal problems — including pressures for staffers to work overtime — but insisted that it would continue bettering itself.

A lot of the backlash Qu received came from Gen Z workers in China who are increasingly moving away from the nation’s hard-charging workplace culture.

In 2019 for example Alibaba co-founder endorsed a “996” trend coined by Chinese tech workers meaning people work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.

Ma called the concept a “huge blessing” but younger employees entering the workforce are no longer having it.

“The capitalists don’t even bother to pretend now” wrote one user of Chinese social-media platform Weibo in a response to Qu’s videos according to The Journal. “They just handed down their bloody rules to the public like a rapacious aggressor.”

Even the Communist Party-controlled Youth Daily called the incident an example of “wolf culture” and was the byproduct of the country’s market economy in a Thursday editorial reviewed by The Journal.

The backlash against Qu according to the state media platform “was a counterattack on wolf culture by human nature.”

As Baidu struggled from the negative press Baidu’s shares dropped by more than 6% in the US and 3% in Hong Kong this week.

Representatives for Baidu did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment."

Joe Manchin D-W.Va. was the key obstacle to reaching a deal this week on passing both the Democratic infrastructure bill that passed the Senate last month and the broader bill to address climate change and provide $3.5 trillion over 10 years for a vast range of spending that would impact the lives of poor and middle-income people. As a result House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed back the House infrastructure vote suggesting it might come on Friday. (At publication time that had not yet happened.)

Progressives in the House so far have held fast against passing the infrastructure bill — which they support — without also getting the Senate including Manchin to approve the broader bill with the measures that Biden campaigned on. That bill would create universal pre-K saving the average family an estimated $13000 annually; lower the costs of some child care; give free school meals to 9 million children; add dental eye and hearing coverage to Medicare; lower costs for Obamacare enrollees; lower drug prices; invest in climate-change measures that would reduce carbon emissions lower energy bills create thousands of conservation jobs and mitigate wildfires; and fund both school repairs and construction of new schools.

The White House says the investment of $3.5 trillion will be funded by raising taxes on the rich and slightly boosting corporate taxes (though still far below historic rates). The bill's investments will generate much more in revenues than they cost by slowing the impact of climate change improving education and so on.

Manchin however has consistently balked at the initial price tag and refused to vote for anything over $1.5 trillion. He has also objected to the bill's climate-change measures calling some of them ""very very disturbing.""

This comes despite the recent and very troubling UN climate report that said some climate change effects are already here and will be irreversible for centuries at least.

But why is Manchin who chairs the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources — a key position in ensuring the country pursues more climate-friendly policies — so adamantly against taking the proper steps to address or at least curb the effects of climate change?

Manchin has a vested and longstanding interest in the coal industry as a senator from West Virginia. The state is second in the nation in coal production and coal is part of its identity. Between 2011 the year covered by his first Senate disclosure filing and 2020 Manchin raked in a total of $5211154 in dividend income from Enersystems a coal and energy resource company he founded in 1988 before entering the public sector according to annual financial disclosures. The senator earned $491949 in dividends last year alone as journalist Alex Kotch reported this summer.

The filings show that Manchin has made an average of $521115 more than half a million dollars every year from Enersystems. Dividend income from before Manchin took office isn't public but since he joined the Senate the least he has made from Enersystems is $243663 in 2015. The most was $865065 in 2012.

Enersystems represents a staggering 71 percent of Manchin's investment income according to FinePrint. It accounts for 30 percent of his net worth. His stake in the company is worth as much as $5 million. Manchin in other words has a vested interest in creating policies to keep coal profitable.

And the family business isn't Manchin's only conflict of interest. He rakes in cash from other big names in the fossil fuel industry.

It's no surprise Manchin has scoffed at legislation to address climate change. In 2019 he slammed the Green New Deal telling CNN's Chris Cuomo ""I've got to work with the realities and I've got to work with the practical.""

In reality climate change action is not only necessary it is very practical. In fact some of the world's biggest automakers have already ramped up efforts to phase out gas-powered vehicles in exchange for electric-vehicle fleets in line with Biden's plan for a national framework of EV charging stations.

Earlier this year Unearthed Greenpeace U.K.'s investigative unit obtained video of now-former Exxon lobbyist Keith McCoy discussing 11 senators he called crucial to Exxon's interests referring to Manchin in particular as ""the kingmaker.""

McCoy bragged about speaking with Manchin's office on a weekly basis. Environmental groups based outside Manchin's home state however reportedly said they enjoy far less access than Exxon has.

According to FEC filings Manchin has taken a combined $12500 in campaign contributions from ExxonMobil's PAC since 2012. The most recent contributions came during Manchin's last race in 2018 and totaled a combined $5000.

Manchin took in donations from several other big names in the oil and gas business as recently as April when he accepted $5000 from Marathon Oil's PAC. The list goes on and on. According to data compiled by OpenSecrets the senator has taken more money from the fossil fuel industry in the current election cycle than any other Democrat.

Marriott Jr. School of Hospitality and Tourism Management.

In Friday's announcement the Union Club Hotel will also be designated an ""Autographed"" property.

""I hope Bruce and Beth (White) know that there is just no way we can express how important they've been to Purdue University even before today"" Mitch Daniels president of Purdue said. ""It's yet another great announcement I get to make.""

Bruce and Beth White's and the Dean and Barbara White Family Foundation's $5 million pledge will allow for the development of an honors program in hospitality.

The Union Club Hotel was built on the West Lafayette campus at Purdue University from 1929-1953. White Lodging founded by Bruce White partnered with Purdue in 2019 to completely renovate Union Club Hotel to include a new restaurant bar and coffee counter according to White Lodging's website.

""Marriott and White Lodging have had a wonderful relationship throughout the years"" Liam Brown Marriot Group president said. ""And Mr. Marriott and the entire Marriott family is humbled by this recognition.""

Marriot Group has worked with Purdue over many years including on Marriott Hall which according to Brown has been supported by the Marriott Family Foundation for nearly a decade.

The Union Club Hotel was also announced to be an Autograph property.

""Autograph Collection hotels are a group of more than 200 independent hotels around the world"" Brown explained. ""Hand selected for their distinct perspectives on design and hospitality.""

The Union Club Hotel is more than a newly renovated lodging space as it also serves as the ""hands-on"" learning laboratory for hospitality students at Purdue where they have first-hand experiences working in the hospitality industry according to a Purdue release.

Marriott Jr.,"Purdue University named its hospitality school after Merrillville-based White Lodging and hotelier J.W. “Bill” Marriott Jr.

Indiana's West Lafayette-based land-grant university named its School of Hospitality and Tourism Management the White Lodging – J.W. Marriott Jr. School of Hospitality and Tourism Management because of the White family's significant and ongoing financial support. Purdue jointly named it in honor of J.W. “Bill” Marriott Jr. the executive chairman and chairman of the board of Marriott International at the request of Bruce White.

White Lodging the hospitality company White founded and built a national footprint for was Marriott's first-ever franchisee.

“I am delighted and humbled by this incredible recognition"" Marriott said. ""We have had a wonderful relationship with White Lodging and Bruce and Beth White for decades. The relationship with Purdue is also a longstanding one and I am grateful to be part of this initiative preparing future hospitality leaders.”

Bruce and Beth White and the Dean and Barbara White Family Foundation invested $30 million to modernize the historic Union Club Hotel which is expected to now be designated an Autograph Collection Hotel. They also are pledging $5 million to fund a hospitality honors program a named headship at the school and a scholarship for top hospitality students.

“Our goal is to create an environment that allows associates to be their best selves and grow through training development and mentorship” Bruce White said. “This goal stands as a foundation that Bill and the Marriott team built for the hospitality industry and continue to support at all levels. I’m very appreciative of Bill’s support throughout our time together and proud that we can play a role in creating the next generation of hospitalitarians at Purdue — at a time when it’s needed more than ever.”

Purdue's hospitality school considered one of the best in the country teaches students all aspects of the business including sales retail management and financial planning.

“While the definition of hospitality hasn’t changed the business of hospitality has evolved greatly — even before the COVID-19 pandemic” Bruce White said. “The industry is complex and the key to thrive like we have in the past is by developing a generation of college graduates with advanced critical thinking financial business AND service skills. There’s no question that hospitality remains an incredible career choice.”

White Lodging which operates 90 hotels and 40 restaurants nationwide employs many graduates of Purdue's School of Hospitality and Tourism Management.

“The generous endowment to support a named headship will allow the College of Health and Human Sciences to attract a creative visionary and transformative leader of the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management” Dean Marion Underwood said. “The gift also provides vitally important support for exceptional students to pursue an education in finance and hospitality.”

White Lodging recently helped renovate the 92-year-old 182-room Union Club Hotel adding three new restaurants and giving a facelift to the public spaces and all the guest rooms. It serves as a learning lab for hospitality students who earn college credits while learning firsthand about hotel and restaurant operations by working there.

Early next year Purdue's Union Club Hotel is expected to be designated as an Autograph Collection Hotel a collection of more than 200 independent hotels with distinguished design and hospitality. The selective designation will let people book stays there through marriott.com and earn and redeem Marriott Bonvoy points there.

“The continued involvement of Marriott the Marriott family and White Lodging have helped accelerate our hospitality program to international recognition and their latest endeavors on campus – today and in recent years – further position us as one of the top hospitality programs in the country” Purdue President Mitch Daniels said. “Our students will have support and learning opportunities from the top hospitality company in the world and one of America’s leading hotel owners developers and management companies – a combination no other university has.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdHJhdmVsbGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy10cmF2ZWwvMjAyMS8xMC8wMy9tb3h5LXRvLW9wZW4tdHdvLW5ldy15b3JrLWhvdGVscy1pbi0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moxy to open two New York hotels in 2022 – Business Traveller,"Marriott is to open two New York properties under its lifestyle Moxy hotels brand next year.

A peek inside the newest location of Pax & Beneficia Coffee at the base of Fort Worth's new AC Marriott Hotel.

Pax & Beneficia Coffee opened the doors to its first coffee shop in August of 2019 in Las Colinas. Now it’s opening a second coffee shop — with plans for more. The second Pax & Beneficia is at the base of the stylish new AC Marriott Hotel located at the intersection of Main Street and 5th Street in downtown Fort Worth.

Pax & Beneficia owners Mouyyad Abdulhadi and Mamdouh Khayat are both Palestinian Americans bringing an international sensibility to the North Texas coffee scene. The idea for the Pax & Beneficia Coffee was born while the duo was traveling on a train trip through snowy Norway. They are all about connecting people and cultures.

“Our coffee shops have an Andalusian/Arabesque/Turkish vibe” Mamdouh Khayat tells PaperCity Fort Worth.

Homey finishes like natural woods and design details including both Turkish and Moroccan tiles present a distinct vibe. The new Fort Worth Pax & Beneficia in the AC Marriott is spacious measuring in at around 1400 square feet.

“The idea is that we want it to feel like an extension of your home with Persian rugs sofas and comfortable chairs to relax in” Mouyyad Abdulhadi says.

The name Pax & Beneficia actually means “Peace and Blessings” in Latin and that’s what these international owners hope the chic spaces bring.

The company logo includes two doves swirling around an olive branch. “It’s a symbolic extension of our brand” Khayat tells PaperCity. “We want it to be a place to bring people together and engender comradery amongst our staff and our patrons.”

Everybody loves a quality cup of coffee or tea in a luxe setting but it’s Pax & Beneficia’s attention to detail that truly sets it apart.

At Pax & Beneficia you can enjoy a Mediterranean avocado toast ― topped with mashed avocado feta cheese grape tomatoes and micro greens. Or for a decidedly Middle Eastern spin on breakfast you can also nosh on tangy labneh and za’atar toast or a za’atar seasoned feta toast.

In an unexpected twist you can even get a crunchy Belgian liege waffle with traditional caramelized sugar pearls in the dough.

Specialty drinks include one dubbed Sunshine in a Cup. This is as an espresso-based drink with lavender and vanilla syrups brightened by a bit of lemon rind. There is also Rosella Iced Tea (which can be enjoyed hot as well) a delightful herbal blend of hibiscus tea lemongrass and licorice.

Pax & Beneficia’s traditional Turkish coffee infused with a touch of cardamom is still something of a rare treat in North Texas. It is served sans sugar but you can certainly sweeten yours.

The house beans at Pax & Beneficia are sourced from Texas-based Merit Coffee Co. and many of its specialty syrups like the rosemary lavender clove cardamom cinnamon and mint are made in-house.

Dallas will get a taste next. Pax & Beneficia plans to open its third location in Dallas’ Victory Park soon. It will hold court at 1700 Cedar Springs just blocks from Klyde Warren Park. This will be a smaller format shop at around 500 square feet.

It will have the same full menu located inside a soon-to-open primary care center called Well Health. The new construction timeline should allow for an opening in the next two or three months.

Pax & Beneficia’s distinctive coffee is spreading. That’s win for bean lovers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MyNC5jb20vbmV3czI0L2JpLWFyY2hpdmUvY2FwaXRhbC0xNS1vbi1vcmFuZ2UtY2FwZS10b3duLWhvdGVsLTIwMjEtMTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TAKE A LOOK | Iconic Cape Town hotel gets R20m revamp turning suites into apartments,"This article forms part of the archives of Business Insider South Africa which was published as a partnership between News24 and Insider Inc between 2018 and 2023.

The iconic 15 on Orange hotel has been given a R20 million makeover.

Now the Capital 15 on Orange taking over from Marriott International's African Pride the 129-room property offers luxury hotel suites and serviced apartments.

It's just one of the latest investments undertaken by Capital Hotels and Apartments which looks to capitalise on the post-pandemic boom in tourism and business.

The one- and two-bedroom apartments up to 120 square-metres in size feature spacious living rooms dining areas and fully equipped kitchens.

Cape Town's 15 on Orange Hotel now run by Capital Hotels and Apartments has officially relaunched following the completion of a R20 million makeover aimed at attracting long-term occupation.

The Capital 15 on Orange located in the heart of Cape Town has a new look and vision. The hotel reopened its doors in August after three months of renovations. Prior to Capital Hotels and Apartments taking over the hotel was part of Marriott International's African Pride collection.

Following months of poor occupancy rates in the wake of a total halt on operations due to the coronavirus-induced hard lockdown in March 2020 Marriott threw in the towel. Capital Hotels and Apartments which operates 11 properties throughout the country stepped in.



Founded by Marc Wachsberger in 2008 Capital's business model was unique and at the time a rarity within the hospitality sector. With owner-managed fully serviced luxury apartments and hotel rooms under one roof the Capital has managed to attract tourists and long-term tenants alike. It's this symbiosis between the two business streams which according to Wachsberger has allowed Capital to weather the Covid-19 storm.

""The hotel room and apartment in our group is always designed to be synergistic and provide flexibility to our guests. From a business perspective flexibility is what got us through Covid-19"" Wachsberger tells Business Insider South Africa.

""We ran an average occupancy of through Covid of 65% and the reason why we did that is when Covid hit hard we were able to take these hotel rooms and apartments and connect them to each other and put them into other markets like long-stay quarantine.""

Adding new hotels to the portfolio during a global pandemic – Capital also recently took over the Zimbali Resort on KwaZulu-Natal's north coast and construction has begun on the new 150-room property in Mpumalanga – is risky. But Covid-19 like the global financial crisis in Capital's founding year has provided opportunity.

""I'd been trying and trying to get another hotel in Cape Town [Capital also has the 70-room Mirage in De Waterkant] but Cape Town is such an exuberant city where when things are going well you can't get in"" says Wachsberger. ""You have to get in when times are bad like they've been with Covid.""

""We were born from the global financial crisis. We've seen bad times.""

And Wachsberger believes these bad Covid times are turning with Capital's recent investment spree primed to take advantage of the post-pandemic travel and business boom. Capital 15 on Orange which launched to much fanfare on Thursday 30 October stands poised to benefit from Cape Town's allure to tourists and international film crews alike.

Much of the R20 million used to revamp the 129-room property has been spent on converting hotel suites to apartments. These one- and two-bedroom apartments up to 120 square-metres in size feature spacious living rooms dining areas and fully equipped kitchens. High-speed uncapped Wi-Fi air conditioning and 55-inch TVs come standard.

""We converted 21 rooms into apartments so that was a big part of the renovation"" says Wachsberger.

""The rooms here were the original rooms from 2009 this hotel originally opened for the 2010 World Cup and they hadn't been renovated. So they were the best rooms in town in 2010 and all of a sudden they're some of the worst rooms in town in 2021. So we brought it back with furniture fittings new carpets new décor. That was really the biggest part of the upgrade.""

The Capital 15 on Orange also features the Emerald Lounge Restaurant and Bar which offers an all-day menu and 24-hour in room dining. A designer spa cafè fitness centre and pool and deck are also open to all guests."

Some online-based groups are laundering a large amount of money from Bangladesh through their ‘e-gift card’ businesses by attracting unsuspecting people mostly the young and adolescents.

These groups are illegally creating e-money under the pretext of virtual gift cards to pay subscription fees for services such as watching movies or boosting content on YouTube and Facebook.

They also help customers transfer money to services like PayPal debit Visa or MasterCard. During this process the operators receive payments in local currency and convert them to US dollars.

These service providers include Daraz.com bd.techtreek.com Ecard.com.bd Gift card bd ecard.com.bd giftcardszonebd.com and gift card house.

They receive money from local customers through mobile financial services (MFS) such as bKash Nagad and Rocket against virtual cards or products and pay the international service providers or companies through illegal channels.

Many people in Bangladesh purchase products from online shopping sites like Amazon Alibaba through virtual PayPal debit Visa or MasterCard. Google Play Apple iTunes Xbox & PlayStation Nintendo Steam and many more gift cards are available in the country.

Several virtual card providers told The Business Post that anyone from Bangladesh could send any amount to a PayPal account and buy anything from an international e-commerce company.

When this reporter posed as a customer and contacted e-gift card store ‘bd.techtreek.com’ owner Zahid Hasan Biswas he told that it is possible to transfer any amount to a PayPal account in the USA from Bangladesh without any extra charge.

“If a customer wants to send money to any country other than the US she/he will have to pay an extra fee. They will have to pay through MFS” Biswas said.

“It’s more like a hundi system.”

Hundi is an illegal money transfer system that deprives the government of tax.

bd.techtreek.com offers gift cards worth $50-100. Zahid said they were not laundering money.

He told The Business Post that they use Payoneer for exchanging any amount above $200 claiming that the service is approved by Bangladesh Bank. “We use gift cards for payments below $50” he said.

Joy Mahmud owner of ‘Gift card bd’ also said that some Bangladeshis living abroad especially in the USA are involved with this transaction system.

Bangladesh Bank’s Executive Director and spokesperson Md Serajul Islam told The Business Post that only banks or financial institutions approved by the central bank can send money aboard and issue MasterCard or Visa Card.

“People should be careful about those who are offering international financial services such as PayPal debit Visa and MasterCard in Bangladesh without BB’s approval” Islam said.

DarazMall a flagship store of Daraz online shopping sells virtual Google play store gift cards. It is trying to woo Bangladeshi customers with a paid campaign on Facebook.

Daraz’s terms and conditions say customers must be over 13 years of age and US residents to avail their services. But anyone from Bangladesh can buy their virtual gift cards by paying through MFS in local currencies.

One of the customers Md Farhad Molla told The Business Post that he bought several gift cards from DarazMall this month. “Anyone can buy virtual gift cards from this platform without hassle” he said.

Daraz declined to comment on the issue.

In Bangladesh financial crime investigators say that young adolescents who play online games on smartphones or electronic devices buy these virtual gift cards.

Bangladeshi merchants who sell goods on e-commerce sites or Facebook and promote video clips on YouTube are using virtual cards to avoid banking system hassle and evade the government’s 15 per cent VAT.

For gift cards Card House is charging Tk 58 against $1 while the current exchange rate is around Tk 85.

Its owner Mohammad Saif said it is part of their strategy to boost business.

‘‘PayPal bitcoin transactions are done in various clandestine ways in Bangladesh. We are getting these facilities” Saif said without elaborating.

Gift Card House located on Khulna’s Belayet Hossain Road sells virtual gift cards with a trade license from the city corporation. They are charging Tk 65 against $1. Its owner Ibrahim Khalil said he had a good stock of gift cards.

“Just buy the gift cards if you need them. Don’t bother about the payment system” he said.

Ecard.com.bd sells ‘Vanilla VISA Gift Card and Vanilla Master Card’ for Facebook or YouTube boosting. The company’s website says it is an easy payment method with ‘instant email delivery’. They have multiple payment options like bKash Rocket Nagad and Bank Transfer and there is no service charge or extra fee on payment.

One of the owners of Ecard told The Business Post that they did not bother to have Bangladesh Bank’s permission to provide financial card services.

Md Mesbaul Haque General Manager of the Payment Systems Department of Bangladesh Bank said all foreign gift card wallet services include Payoneer and lottery are illegal in Bangladesh. The central bank published two public notices between 2019 and 2021 in this regard.

He said BB had sought opinion from the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission. They too said the payment services were illegal in Bangladesh.

Criminal Investigation Department’s Special Police Superintendent for Financial Crime Humayun Kabir said laundering money through virtual transactions is easy. “It’s a kind of hundi” he said.

“We are aware of the online virtual card businesses that are laundering money. Our team is working on the issue” Kabir said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFvbmUuY29tL21vbmV5L2NpbWItd29ybGQtbWFzdGVyY2FyZC1yZXZpZXctMjAyMS11bmxpbWl0ZWQtY2FzaGJhY2stMi10aGVyZXMtY2F0Y2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CIMB World Mastercard review 2021: Unlimited cashback of up to 2% but there's a catch,"Cashback credit cards are some of the most worthwhile cards to sign up for because they’re essentially giving you free money. Seeing as even McDonald’s charges for sauce these days we’ll take whatever free stuff we can get.

But most cashback cards require you to satisfy minimum spending requirements and impose a cap on the amount of cashback you can earn each month — meaning you have to work for that “free” money.

Not so for CIMB World Mastercard which professes to offer unlimited cashback of up to 2 per cent.

But is it really as good as it sounds? Let’s find out.

CIMB World Mastercard terms & conditions

CIMB World Mastercard Annual fee & waiver Free Supplementary annual fee Free Interest free period 23 days Annual interest rate 25.9 per cent Late payment fee $100 Minimum monthly repayment 3 per cent or $50 whichever is higher Foreign currency transaction fee 3 per cent Cash advance transaction fee 6 per cent or $15 whichever is higher Overlimit fee $50 or 5 per cent of excess whichever is higher Minimum income $30000 Card association MasterCard Wireless payment MasterCard PayPass

How the CIMB World Mastercard works

CIMB World Mastercard has declared itself the most generous unlimited cashback card in Singapore offering cashback of 2 per cent with no minimum spending requirement and no cashback cap.

2 per cent is certainly generous when you consider that the next best unlimited cashback cards are only offering 1.5per cent to 1.7 per cent cashback. But alas reality doesn’t quite match up to the advertising.

First of all unlimited cashback cards in Singapore usually offer cashback on all spending. By contrast the CIMB World Mastercard only offers 2 per cent cashback on spending in certain categories namely: drinking dining and online food delivery movies and digital entertainment taxis and automobile and luxury goods.

There is another catch. You only qualify for the 2 per cent cashback on these spending categories when you spend $1000 and above in a statement month. If you don’t manage to spend $1000 you get only 1 per cent cashback.

What about miscellaneous spending outside of these above-mentioned categories? You can get 1per cent cashback… but only if you spend at least $500 in a statement month.

Who is the CIMB World Mastercard best for?

Unlimited cashback cards tend to be useful because they let you spend on those big-ticket miscellaneous purchases that no other card will be able to reward you adequately for. Things like wedding dinners and home renovations.

But you wouldn’t be able to do that with the CIMB World Mastercard which limits the 2 per cent cashback to a few categories.

Those who can benefit most from this card are high spenders who have no problem hitting at least $1000 a month in the eligible categories.

The problem is that some of these categories like dining and/or transport already enjoy more generous cashback through other cards like Citi Cash Back Card and CIMB’s own Visa Signature Card with less onerous minimum spending requirements.

So in the end people who would truly benefit from this card would probably be high rollers who have busted the cashback caps on their other cards and are looking for an alternative way to earn cashback on spending in the eligible categories… and who are still able to meet the card’s $1000 spending requirement.

For instance if you’re looking to buy a $20000 Hermes handbag you could get 2 per cent cashback or $400 back by using the card to pay since one of the eligible categories is luxury goods. In this case it’d be hard to find another card that would be willing to pay $400 worth of cashback in a single month.

What’s the card’s biggest plus? It is free for life. So there’s no harm in just applying for it and keeping it on hand in case you too decide to buy a $20000 Hermes handbag someday.

Other unlimited cashback cards to consider

Truth be told the newly-revamped CIMB World Mastercard isn’t for everyone. It’s really for a specific kind of person who spends a lot on drinking dining and luxury shopping. That probably applies to a significant chunk of Singaporeans though.

However if this credit card unfortunately doesn’t suit you there are plenty of other unlimited cashback cards to choose from. Here are some of the best.

Citi Cash Back+ Card – 1.6 per cent cashback on all spending with no cashback cap and no minimum spend. What’s more in your first three months with the card you get 4.5 per cent cashback on up to $5000 worth of spending.

Standard Chartered Unlimited Cashback Card – 1.5 per cent cashback on all spending with no cashback cap and no minimum spend. New sign-ups get cashback upon hitting the minimum spend requirement and six free months of Disney+.

UOB Absolute Cashback Card – 1.7 per cent cashback on all spending with no cashback cap and no minimum spend. Just note that it’s an American Express card and some merchants don’t accept it.

Tourism Council of Bhutan (TCB) has been declared one of the Most Innovative Organisations in Tourism Policy 2021.

Bhutan is among 75 Most Innovative Organisations and the ranking list was announced by Apolitical a profit company in partnership with the United Nations World Tourism Organisation ( UNWTO) and Mastercard during UNWTO’s celebration of World Tourism Day on September 27.

Organisations were nominated through an open nominations process that included recommendations from individuals NGOs organizations governments and global leaders. Organisations were ranked and selected by a team of expert reviewers.

Tourism Council of Bhutan (TCB) attributes the recognition to the visionary policy and practice of “ High-value Low volume” which have guided the country’s approach to tourism long before sustainable and responsible tourism concepts were introduced in the global tourism sphere.

TCB Director General Dorji Dhradhul said high-value low-volume regulated and managed tourism over mass tourism and quality over quantity. “Therefore with utmost humility and deepest gratitude we would like to dedicate this honour to the visionary leadership of our extraordinary Kings.”

He said the pandemic had made it necessary to rethink tourism and TCB strived to come back to rebuild lives and livelihoods through a more sustainable resilient and inclusive tourism economy.

Dorji Dhradhul said that the country was taking steps forward to become a global model ecotourism destination by launching plans to mainstream biodiversity conservations into tourism development. “ It is another milestone in achieving high-value tourism goals.”

While online classes have become the norm amid the COVID-19 pandemic academics from Japan and Hong Kong believe that online classes cannot truly be a substitute for face-to-face learning despite the merits of technology in communicating with students.

""Learning does not take place in the classroom it happens outside the classroom on campus where students can interact"" among themselves and with teachers Oussouby Sacko president of Kyoto Seika University said in a recent webinar.

The webinar on the future of education was organized by the Awaji Youth Federation an educational group in Japan as the academic world faces the challenges posed by online learning.

Sacko said professors at his university in western Japan have struggled to teach for example art-related courses online and students were also losing their interest in attending classes.

To motivate the students Sacko who hails from Mali has introduced a hybrid system of direct interactive sessions between teachers and students once a week and online classes on other days.

Recognizing the challenges teachers face in holding virtual classes he said there is a need to develop a program for the faculty to train them to become accustomed to the new teaching style.

An online survey by the National Federation of University Co-operative Associations in July has shown that 44.7 percent of students do not find their lives fulfilling amid the pandemic citing the limitations of online classes as one of the factors.

Baniel Cheung adjunct assistant professor at Hong Kong University's Faculty of Business and Economics shared the sentiments of Sacko on the benefits of face-to-face learning even as he recognized the benefits of speed of information and knowledge sharing via online classes.

""It is difficult to teach without seeing the students' faces and body language to really know what the other person thinks"" Cheung said adding that while teaching could be ""hybrid"" in the post-COVID era ""digital cannot replace humans.""

Representing the students' voice Fuka Chida a sophomore at Chiba University said the pandemic has reinforced the importance of campus learning.

""University is not just about studies but a place where I can learn about myself through interactions with others and grow"" said Chida Japan ambassador of the Youth and United Nations Global Alliance a group created in partnership among U.N. agencies and civic groups dedicated to children and youth.

Sacko said the pandemic has made it easier for students to communicate through the social messaging app Line and noted how shy students are more actively participating in classes than before.

Cheung said he uses messaging platform WhatsApp to communicate with students having created different groups for different purposes. The tool is used to narrow what he calls ""the psychological distance.""

Looking ahead he underscored the vital role of technology for future inter-university collaboration.

Cheung said online collaborations among universities have become more prevalent during the pandemic and called for continuing such efforts especially between universities in Asia.

""Students have become more competitive during the pandemic and want to learn more skills to survive in the companies so inter-Asia exchanges should be held"" he said at the webinar by the federation founded by Japanese staffing firm Pasona Group Inc.

He added he hopes Japanese universities will offer more courses in English that are popular with students in Asia such as manga and animation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3ZpZXcvMjAyMS13b3JsZC13b21lbnMtdGVhbS1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 World Women's Team Championship: All The Information,"2021 World Women's Team Championship: All The Information

And it’s not like Juve hasn’t had big games already this season.

So now it’s the game after the latest big game.

And it just so happens there’s another big game on the horizon.

It’s not the Champions League or against one of the best teams in Europe — or even Serie A for that matter — but after an emotional roller coaster Wednesday there is bound to be more of the same come Saturday night.

The season’s first edition of the Derby della Mole is almost upon us with big brother facing little brother at the stadium that Juventus used to call home. It is a game one that almost always have a close scoreline no matter what kind of form either of the two teams are in that will either continue the good times coming out of the Chelsea win or leave a rather sour feeling heading into the second international break of the season. With the situation Juventus is in when it comes to Serie A — sitting level on eight points with you guessed it Torino — those are really the only two options. You know what I mean right?

A win which would be nice.

Dropping points which would come with more frustration and pain.

You know Juve played well when Allegri goes on to describe as a match that “filled me with joy.” That’s not something he says often with an eye always toward what’s to come rather than a good Champions League result in late-September no matter how important it is at the time.

This is what the Turin derby is all about: Winning yes but also trying to continue the positive signs that we’ve seen over the last couple of weeks. Juventus has been good in some areas but bad in others. Juve’s been winning but it hasn’t necessarily been the overwhelming success against mid-table teams that you might hope for. Torino is just like Sampdoria was last weekend sitting in the middle of the pack just like Juventus. Statistically they’ve been better than Juve in a few areas which is a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it.

But as we know so many times in the Derby della Mole it’s pretty convenient to just throw out the form of the last few weeks and just hope Juventus survive it. This is Torino’s Champions League final. This is the game they circle on the calendar every single year and want to do anything possible to make sure Juventus doesn’t win it. And with fans back in the stands you gotta think that the Torino players are going to have even more of a desire to try and beat Juventus for the first time in their last 15 meetings.

Juventus can’t afford to see that happen knowing that points are so precious these days even though we’re just now hitting the first weekend of October. And with there being some pretty big fixtures happening throughout the weekend between clubs that are above Juventus in the standings there’s a very good chance to make a nice jump up the standings if those aforementioned games go a certain way.

No matter what though as the first Derby della Mole arrives I think we can feel comfortable in saying that if Juve play anywhere close to how they did midweek against Chelsea when they make the trip across Turin this weekend then it will be a pretty good vibe going around the club heading into the international break.

TEAM NEWS

Paulo Dybala — still out injured.

Alvaro Morata — still out injured.

Aaron Ramsey — still out injured.

“Wojciech Szczesny and Giorgio Chiellini will both start tomorrow” according to Allegri at his pre-match press conference. The rest of the starting lineup will be determined Saturday morning and be based on how players are doing fatigue-wiese.

Allegri said that Arthur and Kaio Jorge could be on the bench for the Turin derby. Arthur returned to training earlier this week falling right in line with his three-month timetable.

JUVENTUS PLAYER TO WATCH

So I swung and completely missed midweek. It happens it’s part of the game. (And let’s be honest if you thought it was going to be the two Fedes at the two forward spots then you’re wasting your time here and need to start playing the lottery instead.)

Therefore I will go with an easy-as-hell kind of pick. I mean it this time.

Ah Freddie Church. You wonderful wonderful person. You jolly fella who dribbles the ball like you want to destroy the defender(s) who is standing in front of you trying to take the ball away. He’s good really freakin’ good — and he’s only getting better.

The difference between what Chiesa has been doing of late as compared to say what he was doing over the summer with the Italian national team is the simple fact of where he’s being played. Just like in Wednesday’s win over Chelsea Chiesa is — essentially by need — playing as a striker rather than out on the wing and doing damage there.

That looks like it will continue for at least one more game with Dybala and Morata out injured.

The rumors as of this writing is that Chiesa will start with Moise Kean up front against Torino. (So in a way I could have just copy and pasted some of what I wrote about Kean earlier in the week right? But I am better than that and will bring you some brand new words for you to consume.) As good as it will be to see Kean get some real playing time — and don’t you go saying that cameo appearances off the bench are the same type of deal — watching Chiesa continue to do what he’s been doing for much of the calendar year is simply fun as hell to think about.

Basically Chiesa isn’t necessarily being spotlighted here because he’s suddenly going to be crucial to Juventus’ success. Nah it’s been like that for months now. But he’s here because he’s so damn good already and he’s only continuing to be the go-to guy in the biggest of matches.

And while this final game before the October international break doesn’t have the same kind of headline-grabbing levels that the one that Juventus just played did it’s still an important game Chiesa and Co. look to try and rebound after their rocky start.

By Anna J. Park



So far this year Morgan Stanley has been enjoying the top position among finance companies providing advisory services to local companies going through mergers and acquisitions (M&As).



Morgan Stanley is more than 3 trillion won ($2.5 billion) ahead of JPMorgan which has been in the second position in the M&A advisory market so far this year in terms of the total value of M&A deals they have made based on their advisory services. So it is highly likely that Morgan Stanley will maintain its top position until the end of this year.



The $4 billion acquisition deal for Korea's top food delivery app Baemin is the main reason Morgan Stanley has been the top player in the local M&A advisory market this year.



Morgan Stanley also advised on other major M&A deals including the sale of global communication platform Hyperconnect to U.S.-based Match Group the sale of Samsung Display's LCD factory in China to CSOT and the sale of Job Korea to Affinity Equity Partners. The global finance company also advised on another major deal here the sale of eBay Korea for 3.4 trillion won to retailer E-mart.



JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs follow in the top M&A advisory player list as they took the second and third positions in terms of cumulative deals in the first three quarters of this year.



JPMorgan in particular had been shut out of the top 10 list during the first quarter of this year. Yet it jumped to the top three in the second quarter with the completion of major deals including HYBE's acquisition of Ithaca Holdings and the sale of waste management firm Clenco.



The total amount of cumulative M&A deals during the first three quarters of this year reached 54.9 trillion won with 416 deals. This figure is a huge increase from the 35.6 trillion won made from 320 deals logged in the same period of last year.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy1zaWduLWRyYWZ0LXBpY2tzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtdG8tcm9va2llLWNvbnRyYWN0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers sign draft picks Mason McCormick Logan Lee to rookie contracts,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://triblive.com/sports/steelers-sign-draft-picks-mason-mccormick-logan-lee-to-rookie-contracts/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy1zaWduLWRyYWZ0LXBpY2tzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtdG8tcm9va2llLWNvbnRyYWN0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0LWdhemV0dGUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL25mbC1kcmFmdC1uZXdzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1zb3V0aC1kYWtvdGEtc3RhdGUtbWF0dC16aW1tZXIvc3Rvcmllcy8yMDI0MDUxMDAwMDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Mason McCormick contribute to the Steelers' OL in 2024?,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtbmV3cy8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM5MzYvc3RlZWxlcnMtc2lnbi1yb29raWVzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtY29udHJhY3QtdGVybXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers officially sign rookies Mason McCormick Logan Lee,"The Pittsburgh Steelers officially signed two members of their 2024 NFL Draft class Friday including fourth-round guard Mason McCormick and sixth-round DL Logan Lee.

McCormick in particular could be in a position to earn some significant playing time in the 2024 season with several question marks remaining regarding the current configuration of players on the offensive line.

Daniels is in the final year of his contract with the Steelers with a 2024 cap hit of just under $11.2 million. By trading or releasing Daniels the Steelers can save $8.25 million against the salary cap in 2024.

Related Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024

Though McCormick might afford the Steelers the flexibility to make that decision on the roster It would still be a surprise to see them do so especially given the fact that they’ve got two other rookies presumably starting on the offensive line this year including OT Troy Fautanu and C Zach Frazier.

The Steelers have 43 players on their 2024 Rookie Minicamp Roster with 12 of them being rookies in this class including five undrafted free agents who received contracts. That leaves five drafted rookies remaining with whom the team will need to finalize a deal ahead of training camp including first-round OT Troy Fautanu second-round center Zach Frazier third-rounders WR Roman Wilson and LB Payton Wilson as well as sixth-round DB Ryan Watts."

She justified her actions by saying she has diabetes and her “blood sugar is low.”

@still.bad.decisions the TikToker who posted the video is seen helping the McDonald’s employees pick up the materials that the woman knocked over.

“I lost my Karen virginity today” wrote @still.bad.decisions in the overlay text of the video. The TikToker also clarified that the woman was waiting on a cup of coffee.

Many TikTokers who identified themselves as diabetics in the comments explained that having low blood sugar is no excuse for the woman’s behavior.

“As a diabetic when my blood sugar is low I sit down and ask for help” commented @troopermoo. “Not destroy a store.”

“My dad is a diabetic & when his sugar gets low he gets sleepy. When mine gets low I sweat & get shaky” wrote @maryv.campbell. “Not throw a tantrum.”

“I’m a type one diabetic” commented @mommabearhugs. “We do not claim her.”

Others joked about the woman’s exaggerated behavior.

“I mean I totally get it” commented @dumpsterdivingfreegan. “The last time my blood sugar got low I set multiple buildings on fire. It just affects everyone differently!”

“Why can’t people behave like adults” commented @user3504954322212.

Attention fans of big burgers: we have some news.

McDonald’s is bringing back the Double Big Mac after diehard fans begged the brand to return the feast to their menu.

For those not already on the Double Big Mac hype train let us explain.

This is a burger that’s a lot like the Big Mac but with double the meat.

So while a regular Big Mac has two patties with an extra bun in between the Double has a bun two patties another bun then two more patties followed by that final bun.

Plus there’s a slice of cheese some lettuce onion and pickles and the classic Big Mac sauce.

It’s a bit like the Grand Mac except you don’t need to get your measuring tape out to know it’s larger than the standard – you can clearly see the double meat serving.

Anyway the Double Big Mac was on UK menus for a bit then got removed – much to the rage of its fans.

So now from October 6 McDonald’s is bringing it back. But it’s not all good news – the menu item will only be available for six weeks. You’ll need to act fast.

It’ll cost £4.19 for just the burger or you can get a medium meal for £5.69.

Along with the mega burger the fast food brand is also restoring order with a few other much-loved dishes.

The Nacho Cheese Wedges are making a return too (Picture: McDonald’s)

The Crunchie McFlurry is also making a comeback plus Nacho Cheese Wedges – nacho cheese and spicy jalapeños covered in crunchy coating and served with a sour cream and chive dip.

While lovers of these specific items will be overjoyed this menu shake-up does come at a cost.

These three items will be replacing the Big Tasty the Chicken BBQ Smokehouse and Mozzarella Dippers.

If you’ll miss any of those bits dearly we’d suggest getting a move on and feasting upon them for their final few days.

One of the interesting points was when she told viewers that they got McDonald’s delivered to the villa.

One follower asked if this was true and Kaz said;

“Yeah a lot… and everyone would order twenty chicken nuggets my McDonald’s order in the villa was actually embarrassing.

“I used to get a Big Mac meal or a quarter pounder meal large with extra fries and then I’d get twenty chicken nuggets and then I’d get a McFlurry. And I would eat like half of it.”

On the show we very rarely see the Islanders eating meals unless they’ve had to cook it as a challenge or it’s a melon in the shape of their name made by an Islander trying to woo then (shout out to Toby).

So for some reason the idea of the Islander’s sitting around eating McDonald’s is so entertaining. Was it like one big sleepover? Sounds fun tbh.

Kaz also let viewers know how long the girls actually had to get ready for their evenings and the answer might surprise you…

“Sometimes we had like half an hour to get ready sometimes like 45 minutes sometimes it was two hours sometimes it was 15 minutes It just depended. But more often than not I kind of took longer than we were supposed to but they did also give me a little bit of leeway.

“I feel like the producers were actually quite good to me in the sense that they gave me extra time a lot of the time.”

Wow 15 minutes? The girls always look stunning in the villa that is very impressive for their short time scale especially because Kaz confirmed that they did all of their hair and makeup themselves.

Kaz also opened up about the therapist on hand in the villa when asked about it she replied;

“Yes. [There was a psychotherapist to talk to] 24/7 to be honest because if you were struggling you could literally be like I need to speak to somebody right now and there was always someone for you to speak to.

“So there was the welfare team and the psych so yeah there was always someone to speak to and sometimes you would just get sent to the psych.

“That happened to me yeah… I think they thought that I was unhinged at some points…I was I needed it and I’m glad they did that because I found it really helpful. I think most of us did.”"

Organizers said about 4500 people signed up to compete in the full marathon Sunday. About 8500 were expected in the 10-miler with another 4500 taking on Saturday events.

""It's very comforting to be back here and see all our friends and the community"" said Virginia Brophy Achman the executive director of Twin Cities in Motion. ""The fall tradition is back. That's what feels good.""

Key changes to the event included half-capacity races and taller fencing at the finish line to prevent people from gathering in big groups.

""To be able to come back even at half-capacity is big. We are allowed to be running on the roads which is a big deal. That means that's more normal and what we're all used to"" Brophy Achman said ""and it allows the community to come watch.""

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-treatment-type-uterus-cancer-fails-trial-2024-05-09/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnZlc3RvcnMtaGVhdmlseS1zZWFyY2gtbWVyY2stY28tMTMwMDE2MjkzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investors Heavily Search Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK): Here is What You Need to Know,"Merck (MRK) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +2.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry to which Merck belongs has gained 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

Merck is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share for the current quarter representing a year-over-year change of +202.9%. Over the last 30 days the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +8.3%.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $8.66 points to a change of +473.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.3%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $9.91 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.7%.

With an impressive externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Merck.

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

For Merck the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.91 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.8%. For the current and next fiscal years $64.28 billion and $68.81 billion estimates indicate +6.9% and +7.1% changes respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Merck reported revenues of $15.78 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +8.9%. EPS of $2.07 for the same period compares with $1.40 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.32 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.95%. The EPS surprise was +6.7%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples such as price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on) is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

Merck is graded C on this front indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

""We continue to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content. To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.""

Facebook has since said that the Journal's reporting cherry-picked data and that even headlines on its own internal presentations ignored potentially positive interpretations of the data like that many users found positive impacts from engagement with their products.

The documents first reported by the Journal  revealed that Facebook executives had been aware of negative impacts of its platforms on some young users among other findings. For example the Journal reported that one internal document found that of teens reporting suicidal thoughts 6% of American users traced the urge to kill themselves to Instagram.

Jeff Horwitz the Journal reporter who wrote the series of articles based on the leaked documents also shared Haugen's identity on Twitter on Sunday night revealing her as the key source behind the stories.

""I've seen a bunch of social networks and it was substantially worse at Facebook than anything I'd seen before"" Haugen told ""60 Minutes.""

Haugen previously worked as a product manager at Pinterest  Yelp and Google  according to her LinkedIn profile . She also lists herself as the technical co-founder behind the dating app Hinge saying she took its precursor Secret Agent Cupid to market.

Frances Haugen  a former product manager on Facebook's civic misinformation team according to her website revealed herself as the source behind a trove of leaked documents. On her personal website she shared that during her time at the company she ""became increasingly alarmed by the choices the company makes prioritizing their own profits over public safety — putting people's lives at risk. As a last resort and at great personal risk Frances made the courageous act to blow the whistle on Facebook.""

A Facebook whistleblower who brought internal documents detailing the company's research to The Wall Street Journal and the U.S. Congress unmasked herself ahead of an interview she gave to ""60 Minutes"" which aired Sunday night.

Facebook VP of Content Policy Monika Bickert addressed the research in an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Monday.

""If we were a company who didn't care about safety if we were about trying to prioritize profit over safety we wouldn't do this kind of research"" Bickert said. ""The whole point is understanding how we can be better and make a better experience.""

Haugen said she decided this year to make Facebook's internal communications public saying she realized she would need to do so ""in a systemic way"" and ""get out enough that no one can question that this is real.""

Haugen in turn copied and released tens of thousands of pages of documents ""60 Minutes"" reported.

Haugen pointed to the 2020 election as a turning point at Facebook. She said Facebook had announced it was dissolving the ""Civic Integrity"" team to which she was assigned after the election. Just a few months later social media communications would be a key focus in the wake of the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.

""When they got rid of Civic Integrity it was the moment where I was like 'I don't trust that they're willing to actually invest what needs to be invested to keep Facebook from being dangerous'"" Haugen told ""60 Minutes.""

Facebook told the news program that it had distributed the work of the Civic Integrity team to other units.

Haugen pointed to Facebook's algorithm as the element that pushes misinformation onto users. She said Facebook recognized the risk of misinformation to the 2020 election and therefore added safety systems to reduce that risk. But she said Facebook loosened those safety measures once again after the election.

""As soon as the election was over they turned them back off or they changed the settings back to what they were before to prioritize growth over safety"" Haugen said. ""And that really feels like a betrayal of democracy to me.""

In an interview with the Journal published shortly after the ""60 Minutes"" piece began to air Haugen said she had found much of the research she took with her in Facebook's internal employee forum which she said was accessible to virtually all Facebook employees. She looked for research from colleagues she admired according to the Journal which she often found in goodbye posts calling out Facebook's alleged failures.

Haugen also told the Journal that she openly questioned why Facebook didn't hire more workers to tackle its issues with human exploitation on its platforms among other things.

""Facebook acted like it was powerless to staff these teams"" she told the Journal.

Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone told the Journal that it has ""invested heavily in people and technology to keep our platform safe and have made fighting misinformation and providing authoritative information a priority.""

Lawmakers have appeared unmoved by Facebook's responses to the Journal's reporting based on Haugen's disclosures. During a hearing before the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection Thursday senators on both sides of the aisle lambasted the company urging it to make its temporary pause on building an Instagram platform for kids permanent. The lawmakers said they did not have faith Facebook could be a good steward of such a platform based on the reports and past behavior.

The whistleblower is scheduled to testify before the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection on Tuesday. Facebook's Global Head of Safety Antigone Davis told lawmakers on Thursday that Facebook would not retaliate against the whistleblower for her disclosures to the Senate.

Still Bickert would not commit that Facebook would refrain from suing Haugen during her ""Squawk Box"" interview.

""Facebook's actions make clear that we cannot trust it to police itself"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal D-Conn. who chairs the subcommittee said in a statement Sunday night. ""We must consider stronger oversight effective protections for children and tools for parents among the needed reforms.""

Haugen said she has ""empathy"" for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying he ""has never set out to make a hateful platform. But he has allowed choices to be made where the side effects of those choices are that hateful polarizing content gets more distribution and more reach.""

She called for more regulations over the company to keep it in check.

""Facebook has demonstrated they cannot act independently Facebook over and over again has shown it chooses profit over safety"" Haugen told ""60 Minutes."" ""It is subsidizing it is paying for its profits with our safety. I'm hoping that this will have had a big enough impact on the world that they get the fortitude and the motivation to actually go put those regulations into place. That's my hope.""

That is a fact that Facebook has been anxious to know since last month when an anonymous former employee filed complaints with federal law enforcement. The complaints say Facebook's own research shows that it amplifies hate misinformation and political unrest—but the company hides what it knows. One complaint alleges that Facebook's Instagram harms teenage girls. What makes Haugen's complaints unprecedented is the trove of private Facebook research she took when she quit in May. The documents appeared first last month in the Wall Street Journal. But tonight Frances Haugen is revealing her identity to explain why she became the Facebook whistleblower.

Frances Haugen: The thing I saw at Facebook over and over again was there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook. And Facebook over and over again chose to optimize for its own interests like making more money.

Frances Haugen is 37 a data scientist from Iowa with a degree in computer engineering and a Harvard master's degree in business. For 15 years she's worked for companies including Google and Pinterest.

Frances Haugen: I've seen a bunch of social networks and it was substantially worse at Facebook than anything I'd seen before.

Scott Pelley: You know someone else might have just quit and moved on. And I wonder why you take this stand.

Frances Haugen: Imagine you know what's going on inside of Facebook and you know no one on the outside knows. I knew what my future looked like if I continued to stay inside of Facebook which is person after person after person has tackled this inside of Facebook and ground themselves to the ground.

Scott Pelley: When and how did it occur to you to take all of these documents out of the company?

Frances Haugen: At some point in 2021 I realized ""Okay I'm gonna have to do this in a systemic way and I have to get out enough that no one can question that this is real.""

Frances Haugen

She secretly copied tens of thousands of pages of Facebook internal research. She says evidence shows that the company is lying to the public about making significant progress against hate violence and misinformation. One study she found from this year says ""we estimate that we may action as little as 3-5% of hate and about 6-tenths of 1% of V & I [violence and incitement] on Facebook despite being the best in the world at it.""

Scott Pelley: To quote from another one of the documents you brought out ""We have evidence from a variety of sources that hate speech divisive political speech and misinformation on Facebook and the family of apps are affecting societies around the world.""

Frances Haugen: When we live in an information environment that is full of angry hateful polarizing content it erodes our civic trust it erodes our faith in each other it erodes our ability to want to care for each other the version of Facebook that exists today is tearing our societies apart and causing ethnic violence around the world.

'Ethnic violence' including Myanmar in 2018 when the military used Facebook to launch a genocide.

Frances Haugen told us she was recruited by Facebook in 2019. She says she agreed to take the job only if she could work against misinformation because she had lost a friend to online conspiracy theories.

Frances Haugen: I never wanted anyone to feel the pain that I had felt. And I had seen how high the stakes were in terms of making sure there was high quality information on Facebook.

At headquarters she was assigned to Civic Integrity which worked on risks to elections including misinformation. But after this past election there was a turning point.

Frances Haugen: They told us ""We're dissolving Civic Integrity."" Like they basically said ""Oh good we made it through the election. There wasn't riots. We can get rid of Civic Integrity now."" Fast forward a couple months we got the insurrection. And when they got rid of Civic Integrity it was the moment where I was like ""I don't trust that they're willing to actually invest what needs to be invested to keep Facebook from being dangerous.""

Facebook says the work of Civic Integrity was distributed to other units. Haugen told us the root of Facebook's problem is in a change that it made in 2018 to its algorithms—the programming that decides what you see on your Facebook news feed.

Frances Haugen: So you know you have your phone. You might see only 100 pieces of content if you sit and scroll on for you know five minutes. But Facebook has thousands of options it could show you.

The algorithm picks from those options based on the kind of content you've engaged with the most in the past.

Frances Haugen: And one of the consequences of how Facebook is picking out that content today is it is -- optimizing for content that gets engagement or reaction. But its own research is showing that content that is hateful that is divisive that is polarizing it's easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions.

Scott Pelley: Misinformation angry content-- is enticing to people and keep--

Frances Haugen: Very enticing.

Scott Pelley:--keeps them on the platform.

Frances Haugen: Yes. Facebook has realized that if they change the algorithm to be safer people will spend less time on the site they'll click on less ads they'll make less money.

Haugen says Facebook understood the danger to the 2020 Election. So it turned on safety systems to reduce misinformation—but many of those changes she says were temporary.

Frances Haugen: And as soon as the election was over they turned them back off or they changed the settings back to what they were before to prioritize growth over safety.

And that really feels like a betrayal of democracy to me.

Facebook says some of the safety systems remained. But after the election Facebook was used by some to organize the January 6th insurrection. Prosecutors cite Facebook posts as evidence--photos of armed partisans and text including ""by bullet or ballot restoration of the republic is coming!"" Extremists used many platforms but Facebook is a recurring theme.

After the attack Facebook employees raged on an internal message board copied by Haugen. ""…Haven't we had enough time to figure out how to manage discourse without enabling violence?"" We looked for positive comments and found this ""I don't think our leadership team ignores data ignores dissent ignores truth…"" but that drew this reply ""welcome to Facebook! I see you just joined in November 2020… we have been watching… wishy-washy actions of company leadership for years now."" ""…Colleagues… cannot conscience working for a company that does not do more to mitigate the negative effects of its platform.""

Scott Pelley: Facebook essentially amplifies the worst of human nature.

Frances Haugen: It's one of these unfortunate consequences right? No one at Facebook is malevolent but the incentives are misaligned right? Like Facebook makes more money when you consume more content. People enjoy engaging with things that elicit an emotional reaction. And the more anger that they get exposed to the more they interact and the more they consume.

That dynamic led to a complaint to Facebook by major political parties across Europe. This 2019 internal report obtained by Haugen says that the parties ""…feel strongly that the change to the algorithm has forced them to skew negative in their communications on Facebook… leading them into more extreme policy positions.""

Scott Pelley: The European political parties were essentially saying to Facebook the way you've written your algorithm is changing the way we lead our countries.

Frances Haugen: Yes. You are forcing us to take positions that we don't like that we know are bad for society. We know if we don't take those positions we won't win in the marketplace of social media.

Evidence of harm she says extends to Facebook's Instagram app.

Scott Pelley: One of the Facebook internal studies that you found talks about how Instagram harms teenage girls. One study says 13.5% of teen girls say Instagram makes thoughts of suicide worse; 17% of teen girls say Instagram makes eating disorders worse.

Frances Haugen: And what's super tragic is Facebook's own research says as these young women begin to consume this-- this eating disorder content they get more and more depressed. And it actually makes them use the app more. And so they end up in this feedback cycle where they hate their bodies more and more. Facebook's own research says it is not just the Instagram is dangerous for teenagers that it harms teenagers it's that it is distinctly worse than other forms of social media.

Facebook said just last week it would postpone plans to create an Instagram for younger children.

Last month Haugen's lawyers filed at least 8 complaints with the Securities and Exchange Commission which enforces the law in financial markets. The complaints compare the internal research with the company's public face—often that of CEO Mark Zuckerberg—who testified remotely to Congress last March.

Mark Zuckerberg testimony on March 25:

We have removed content that could lead to imminent real-world harm. We have built an unprecedented third-party fact checking program. The system isn't perfect. But it is the best approach that we have found to address misinformation in line with our country's values.

One of Frances Haugen's lawyers is John Tye. He's the founder of a Washington legal group called ""Whistleblower Aid.""

Scott Pelley: What is the legal theory behind going to the SEC? What laws are you alleging have been broken?

John Tye: As a publicly-traded company Facebook is required to not lie to its investors or even withhold material information. So the SEC regularly brings enforcement actions alleging that companies like Facebook and others are making material misstatements and omissions that affect investors adversely.

Scott Pelley: One of the things that Facebook might allege is that she stole company documents.

John Tye: The Dodd-Frank Act passed over ten years ago at this point created an Office of the Whistleblower inside the SEC. And one of the provisions of that law says that no company can prohibit its employees from communicating with the SEC and sharing internal corporate documents with the SEC.

Frances Haugen: I have a lot of empathy for Mark. and Mark has never set out to make a hateful platform. But he has allowed choices to be made where the side effects of those choices are that hateful polarizing content gets more distribution and more reach.

Facebook declined an interview. But in a written statement to 60 Minutes it said ""every day our teams have to balance protecting the right of billions of people to express themselves openly with the need to keep our platform a safe and positive place. We continue to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content. To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.""

""If any research had identified an exact solution to these complex challenges the tech industry governments and society would have solved them a long time ago.""

Facebook is a $1 trillion company. Just 17 years old it has 2.8 billion users which is 60% of all internet-connected people on Earth. Frances Haugen plans to testify before Congress this week. She believes the federal government should impose regulations.

Frances Haugen: Facebook has demonstrated they cannot act independently Facebook over and over again has shown it chooses profit over safety. It is subsidizing it is paying for its profits with our safety. I'm hoping that this will have had a big enough impact on the world that they get the fortitude and the motivation to actually go put those regulations into place. That's my hope.

It looks like the Tennessee Titans are bringing the southern heat up north with them.

The New York Jets are expected to play their hottest October home game in franchise history when the Titans pay them a visit at MetLife Stadium this afternoon (1 p.m. ET CBS).

According to The Weather Channel temperatures in East Rutherford N.J. are expected to reach 76 degrees by kickoff and climb to a peak of 78 degrees by 2 p.m. That would be the highest temperature recorded at a Jets home game in the month of October – the current record is 77 degrees set during a game against the Broncos in Week 5 of the 2018 season.

It is expected to be a cloudy and fairly muggy one in New Jersey although there is no threat of precipitation. Partly cloudy skies are anticipated at kickoff which should transition to mostly cloudy skies by the game’s conclusion. Humidity is projected to range from 47 to 49 percent. The chance of precipitation currently sits at zero percent throughout the game.

The winds will be light coming from the southwest at 6 mph to begin the game and increasing to 7 mph by the fourth quarter.

Since moving to MetLife Stadium in 2010 the Jets have a 6-4 record in home games played at a temperature of 75 degrees or higher. Four of the six wins were by double-digits and all four of the losses were by one score.

New York is looking to build upon its 3-0 home record over Tennessee since the franchise moved from Houston to Nashville in 1997.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtqZXRzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2pldHMtdGl0YW5zLTMtdGFrZWF3YXlzLXphY2gtd2lsc29uLWNvbWVzLW9mLWFnZS1pbi1vdC13aW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jets-Titans 3 Takeaways | Zach Wilson Comes of Age in OT Win,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vYmRuZXdzMjQuY29tL2hlYWx0aC9tZXRsaWZlLWxhdW5jaGVzLWluc3VyYW5jZS1wbGFuLW9mZmVyaW5nLXByb3RlY3Rpb24tZm9yLTUyLWNyaXRpY2FsLWlsbG5lc3Nlc9IBdWh0dHBzOi8vYmRuZXdzMjQuY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9oZWFsdGglMkZtZXRsaWZlLWxhdW5jaGVzLWluc3VyYW5jZS1wbGFuLW9mZmVyaW5nLXByb3RlY3Rpb24tZm9yLTUyLWNyaXRpY2FsLWlsbG5lc3Nlcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MetLife launches insurance plan offering protection for 52 'critical' illnesses,"The insurance plan will provide financial protection until the age of 80 for 52 critical illnesses including heart attacks stroke cancer kidney disease respiratory diseases and dengue the company said in a statement on Sunday.

MetLife notes those diseases are the leading causes of death in Bangladesh.

This is the only health insurance plan in the country that provides financial protection of up to Tk 10 million till the age of 80 years against the highest number of critical illnesses the company said.

“By paying premiums for a relatively shorter period of time (maximum 20 years from the date of purchase) customers and their families can receive insurance coverage for medical treatment or unfortunate death of the policyholder from critical illnesses or any other causes till the age of 80 years” MetLife said.

If a policyholder reaches the age of 80 years without making any claim they will receive up to 100 percent coverage amount of the policy it added.

Though Bangladesh’s average life expectancy has increased to approximately 73 years today’s busy lifestyle and increased stress levels coupled with poor diet and lack of exercise is contributing to the growing prominence of critical illnesses such as heart attack cancer and stroke MetLife said.

Data from the World Health Organization estimates that non-communicable diseases like cancer cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases account for 67 percent of deaths in Bangladesh.

In many cases early intervention and treatment of critical illnesses can lead to improved outcomes however the cost of treatment can severely impact people’s savings and quality of life in the process."

In a burst of multibillion-dollar deals Las Vegas has seen investors pay mountains of money the past few years to own high-profile casino-resorts.

Those sales have also shown what casino operators — well one in particular — are willing to pay to rent these properties.

MGM Resorts International has reached deals since fall 2019 to lease Bellagio MGM Grand Mandalay Bay Aria Vdara and as announced this week The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.

Its initial annual rent ranges from $200 million for The Cosmopolitan to $292 million for MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay.

All but one of the deals involved sale-leasebacks that netted MGM a fortune in proceeds including more than $4 billion for Bellagio alone. Moreover all of the deals involved the same company on the other side of the table New York financial giant Blackstone which has been gobbling up real estate in Southern Nevada for years.

Still the nine-figure rental rates show what MGM is willing to pay to keep running its properties and to take over another towering resort on the Strip The Cosmopolitan without buying its real estate.

A landlord and tenant determine a casino-resort’s rental rate based on a property’s earnings stability market and possible corporate guarantee according to Truist Securities analyst Barry Jonas.

When MGM announced in July that it was selling Aria and Vdara to Blackstone for nearly $3.9 billion in cash and renting them back it noted the sales price was a little over 18 times its rent which initially is $215 million a year.

At the time Tyler Henritze head of real estate acquisitions in the Americas for Blackstone said such deals were attractive for several reasons including “long-term leases with stable cash flows and no capital expenditure obligations and in this case a full corporate guaranty of rent payments from a best-in-class operator.”

After Blackstone purchased multiple MGM-operated properties on the Strip it’s now selling The Cosmopolitan for $5.65 billion. As part of the deal MGM is acquiring the resort’s operations side for more than $1.6 billion and leasing the property from a group of owners.

MGM did not respond to a request for comment Friday on its rental rates.

The casino chain has made a fortune selling its real estate as part of its “asset-light” strategy though as with any deal there are risks to leasing a resort rather than owning the property outright.

Jonas for one noted there is a “finality” to selling a building and losing control over it.

Plus as Macquarie Capital analyst Chad Beynon pointed out tenants “always owe that rent” and have to set aside money every year to pay their landlord.

Even after the coronavirus pandemic sparked catastrophic job losses and led to nationwide casino closures turning the Strip into a ghost town for a while casino landlords came out OK.

One major landlord is now buying another in a $17 billion-plus deal.

Caesars Entertainment spinoff Vici Properties announced in August that it was acquiring MGM Resorts spinoff MGM Growth Properties putting real estate ownership of many of Las Vegas’ biggest hotel-casinos under one company.

After the deal was announced Vici chief executive Edward Pitoniak said the two casino landlords had collected “100 percent of our rent so far through COVID on time and in cash.”

Say hello to curling the next competitive sport in Las Vegas

Shrewd move MGM.

Last week the largest employer on the Strip made the surprise announcement that it’s acquiring the operations of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for $1.625 billion.

It’s part of a larger $5.65 billion real estate deal for Blackstone with a method in vogue in the gaming industry these days: A group of investors is buying the real estate beneath The Cosmopolitan and MGM is getting the operations piece.

In turn under the 30-year contract that has three 10-year options MGM would pay $200 million annual rent to the investment group which includes a Blackstone real estate investment trust and the family trust of the founders of Panda Express.

The Blackstone Group picked up The Cosmopolitan seven years ago for $1.73 billion so it’s netting a nice profit. Former MGM CEO Jim Murren pitched the idea of buying The Cosmopolitan years ago but nothing came of it until last week.

The deal still has to pass regulatory muster probably in early 2022 but Brendan Bussmann director of government affairs for Las Vegas-based Global Market Advisors thinks it will happen.

“The average visitor saw Cosmo as part of the CityCenter complex” Bussmann said. “Now you will be able to create some true synergies between this side of the Strip from Bellagio south.”

A clever deal

The deal is smart on so many levels.

MGM gets to maintain its “assets-light” strategy that the company initiated five years ago. The company has to pay annual rent and generate revenue from the casino the hotel and all of the other assets in the building.

Once The Cosmopolitan deal is done MGM would have only one property — MGM Springfield in Massachusetts — that the company would own. But in regulatory hearings company officials have said a real estate company would buy Springfield by the end of the year which would make MGM the tenant at 100 percent of its resorts.

MGM gets its fair share of customer traffic from the mature well-established baby boomer. Now the company can mine a younger generation as The Cosmopolitan since it opened in 2010 has become a hipster haven.

While The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas is considered a luxury hotel there’s no doubt MGM could persuade some of its new younger customers to move up to the likes of Bellagio through loyalty programs.

Check out the geography of the deal.

From north to south MGM’s holdings down Las Vegas Boulevard would include Bellagio Cosmopolitan CityCenter — Aria and the nongaming Vdara — Park MGM New York-New York Excalibur Luxor and Mandalay Bay.

Everything is pretty much side by side on the west side of the Strip except for one isolated property The Mirage.

The company’s lone property on the east side of the boulevard: MGM Grand.

The Caesars lineup

Now look at its biggest competitor Caesars Entertainment Inc. It’s established the same way on the east side of the Strip with Harrah’s Las Vegas The Linq Flamingo The Cromwell Bally’s Paris Las Vegas and Planet Hollywood.

The lone property on the west side of the Strip: Caesars Palace the company’s flagship and best-known asset.

Caesars also has the advantage of easy access to a transit system it didn’t have to build the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority-owned Las Vegas Monorail. If a major portion of the gaming industry’s future is in group sales for conventions and trade shows Caesars is all set: There’s a Monorail stop at the massive Las Vegas Convention Center and the company’s not-even-broken-in Caesars Forum.

MGM’s acquisition of The Cosmopolitan gives it 3000 recently renovated rooms right near where MGM had envisioned another hotel tower.

Remember the Harmon Hotel the 400-room building with an additional 267 condominium residences and a spa?

It was the last planned property at CityCenter but it was doomed by construction defects and unceremoniously dismantled instead of being imploded like so many classic Vegas resorts. A court case in a civil lawsuit relieved both MGM and its contractor of paying what probably would have been a nine-figure settlement.

One other outcome of MGM’s purchase is that it blocked a potential new Strip competitor. It’s been well-reported that a potential buyer for a place on the Strip is Hard Rock International a gaming company owned by Florida’s Seminole Indian Tribe.

The Seminoles are looking to make a bid to be the third tribal entity to take up residency in Las Vegas but they want to be on Las Vegas Boulevard unlike the off-Strip Virgin Hotels Las Vegas — casino operated by Mohegan Gaming and Entertainment — and the Palms being purchased by the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians of California. Incidentally the San Manuel group made a big move this month hiring a former MGM executive Cynthia Kiser Murphey as its general manager once that transaction closes later this year.

As luck would have it the CEOs of Hard Rock International Jim Allen and MGM Bill Hornbuckle will join Wynn Resorts Ltd. CEO Matt Maddox on the same stage Wednesday for a panel discussion on gaming issues at the Global Gaming Expo.

Here’s hoping they talk about some of these deals that are transforming the Strip.

“I was wounded. Those physical wounds have healed” said Dee Ann Hyatt whose daughter also was hurt and whose brother died in the Oct. 1 2017 shooting. “But the lasting scars for our family remain.”

Hyatt spoke to several hundred people during a sunrise ceremony at the Clark County Government Center in Las Vegas.

She remembered her slain brother Kurt von Tillow a trucker from Northern California before a screen at an outdoor amphitheater that displayed photos of the dead. Fifty-eight people were killed that night and two others died later. More than 850 were injured.

“We continue to live the impact of all that happened that night four years later” Hyatt said. “People thrive and people struggle to live with the physical and mental pain and our lives are forever changed.”

The morning memorial featured a song “Four Years After” sung by Matt Sky that was composed for the anniversary by Mark R. Johnson and released with multi-Grammy award winner Alan Parsons.

The event was the first of several scheduled Friday in Las Vegas and elsewhere including a livestream to California’s Ventura County hosted by a support group called “So Cal Route 91 Heals.” The group also planned a ceremony at a Thousand Oaks park.

Tennille Pereira director of the Vegas Strong Resiliency Center a Las Vegas program set up to support those affected by the shooting noted that about 60% of tickets sold to the fateful concert were purchased by California residents.

The names of the dead will be read beginning at 10:05 p.m. the time the shooting started at a downtown Las Vegas Community Healing Garden.

Pereira also is chairwoman of a Clark County committee developing plans for a permanent memorial. She said next year’s fifth anniversary may feature a dedication of the memorial at a corner of the former concert venue across Las Vegas Boulevard from the Mandalay Bay resort. That’s where the shooter spent several days gathering an arsenal of assault-style rifles before breaking out windows of his 32nd floor suite and unleashing carnage.

Jill Winter of Nashville Tennessee remembers the nearly 10-minute barrage of rapid-fire gunshots into the open-air concert crowd.

Like many around her Winter thought at first it was fireworks. Then people fell dead and wounded. Winter ducked for cover until police SWAT officers arrived and told her to run. She remembers yelling “Make him stop! Make him stop!”

Winter now 49 counsels others she calls the “Router family” who experienced the deadly night at the Route 91 Harvest Festival. “Router” sounds better than “survivor” she explained.

“There is a lot of healing taking place” she said in a telephone interview this week. “There are 22000 of us that were there. That doesn’t even include other people that were impacted … first responders hospital employees average citizens who were driving down the Strip. All those people and all those different stories.”

The gunman Stephen Paddock a 64-year-old retired postal service worker accountant and real estate investor who became a high-stakes casino video poker player killed himself before police reached him. Local and federal investigators concluded he meticulously planned the attack and appeared to seek notoriety but they said they could not identify a clear motive.

Authorities including police elected and government officials and people involved with the resiliency center refuse now to use his name.

MGM Resorts International owner of the hotel and the concert venue is donating 2 acres (0.8 hectare) for the memorial — just off the Strip at a spot near a church where people sought refuge and medical help during the shooting.

The company and its insurers have almost finished paying $800 million to more than 4000 claimants in an out-of-court settlement reached a year ago that avoided negligence trials in several states. The company acknowledged no liability.

“It’s good for the community and the victims that the case is resolved” Robert Eglet a Las Vegas attorney who spent a year arranging the settlement said Thursday. “And it was the right thing for MGM to do.”

Pereira said this week that she felt a softening of emotions around the anniversary.

“Maybe it’s because we just came out of this (coronavirus) pandemic and we’re starting to feel a regular pace again” Pereira said. “We still remember we still respect we still honor. But it’s not raw like it was and jarring. It just feels more hopeful and peaceful.”

This was the first year since the shooting that Winter wasn’t in Las Vegas to mark the anniversary. She said she would gather Friday with other Routers at a friend’s restaurant in Memphis Tennessee.

“It’s always emotional. But it’s also really heartwarming” she said. “The fact that we’ve come together and not let evil win is so amazing.”

Hyatt speaking at the memorial said four years have taught her that some things can’t be fixed.

“All you can do is be there for each other” she said. “Listen cry hug love and support one another. You just need to be patient and loving and caring to everyone you meet because you don’t know what they’re going through.”

International Game Technology Chief Operating Officer of Gaming for IGT Nick Khin and Senior Director of Core Product Roger Pettersson talk about what people can expect from their company at the Global Gaming Expo 2021 conference in Las Vegas.

If there ever was a slot machine supermarket it would be G2E.

Beginning this week gaming industry professionals will gather at The Venetian Expo to see hear and touch what gaming manufacturers say will be the next generation of casino gadgetry designed to keep players more engaged — and to spend more of their entertainment dollar.

Leaders of the American Gaming Association operators of G2E — the Global Gaming Expo — say quality not quantity will be the emphasis of this year’s show.

It’s the largest gaming trade show in the world and over the next four days buyers will be perusing the devices that promise to engage players through new technologies or experiences.

Smaller show

Knowing of the challenges of international travel during the coronavirus pandemic AGA President and CEO Bill Miller isn’t expecting that the 27000 people who usually attend G2E will all show up when the doors open Monday.

“My strong belief is that the mix of people that we have exhibiting and attending will be economically valuable and significant” Miller said in an interview.

“Measuring the success of this G2E based on numbers would not be important” he said. “What I’ve been encouraged by is that the exhibitors have been excited. It’s been two years since they’ve been able to show off in a live manner new technologies new platforms and new entertainment. That is something you can’t replicate in a Zoom call.”

And many participants agree.

“It’s a big deal this year given we didn’t have an in-person G2E last year” said Mike Gatten senior vice president of slot strategy for MGM Resorts International. “There’s something to be said for being able to have hands on and actually play the games and touch and feel and experience that stuff in a more physical environment. It is still the marquee gaming trade show and is the granddaddy of them.”

Gatten is one of those with the authority to make purchases and he and a contingent of MGM slot managers will be on the show floor that opens Tuesday seeking devices that will engage customers.

Among the features Gatten likes most about G2E is that he can comparison shop and that he also gets the chance to see offerings from smaller companies that might not be headquartered in Southern Nevada. It’s easy for him to see the newest buzzworthy machines by paying a visit to the showrooms of IGT Scientific Games Aristocrat and a host of others with a solid Las Vegas presence.

Return to normal

“It is important that G2E happen this year especially as the industry continues to be one of the leaders on health and safety measures for its guests and staff” said Brendan Bussmann director of government affairs for Las Vegas-based Global Market Advisors.

“It is time to start moving things back to normal and emerge from the great shutdown. I look forward to getting together with the colleagues that are able to make it to the show this year. It is however unfortunate that many of our international friends could not join us this year even though they were vaccinated and under the same protocols that we are here.”

Debating the issues

So G2E is a gaming industry shopping mall and a gathering place for professionals. What else?

Miller said it is an opportunity to debate industry issues and to bring in keynote speakers to discuss important topics.

“This is not a symbolic event” Miller said. “There will be conversations about industry growth including sports betting digital payments and payment modernization. The gaming industry is also a leader in inclusions and we’ll have a keynote panel dedicated to that.”

Tuesday afternoon there will be a panel on how casino companies can prioritize diversity. The three speakers are MGM Resorts International Chief People Inclusion and Sustainability Officer Jyoti Chopra; U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Suzanne Clark; and Marriott International Senior Vice President Multicultural Affairs Social Impact and Business Councils Apoorva Gandhi. MSNBC’s Contessa Brewer will moderate the discussion.

That same day Miller will deliver a state of the industry address and Gov. Steve Sisolak and Rep. Dina Titus D-Nev. will take the stage to discuss recovering from the pandemic.

A panel Wednesday will feature Brewer moderating a session with CEOs from three companies weighing in on several industry topics with MGM Resorts International’s Bill Hornbuckle and Wynn Resorts Ltd.’s Matt Maddox participating. Representing the tribal perspective will be Hard Rock International’s Jim Allen whose company is operated by Florida’s Seminole Indian Tribe.

The keynote parade will end Wednesday with Miller interacting with Arizona Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill.

“It’s a great lineup of speakers and I think it is because there’s a lot going on in the industry and clearly we’ve gone through a pretty tough 18 months” Miller said.

There may even be a celebrity or two.

“Wheel of Fortune” star Vanna White is scheduled to conduct a charity celebrity slot tournament where $15000 will go to several causes. It’s all part of IGT’s celebration of the “Wheel of Fortune” slot brand turning 25 years old this year.

‘It’s Game Time’

But in the end it’s mainly all about the massive display of new slots table games and other devices.

“Our theme is ‘It’s Game Time.’ I think it’s a really really appropriate theme for us because I think this is a really big year for products we’ll be showing” said Nick Khin IGT’s chief operating officer for gaming.

“This year’s a special year because a lot of the products and solutions we’re going to be showing are going to have a big impact on the marketplace in general over the next few years.”

Khin is expecting the company’s Diamond RS cabinet to be the talk of the show.

Diamond RS making its global debut at the show is a mechanical reel cabinet that retains player-favorite features including Diamond Glass which can overlay video elements onto the reel window.

Cabinets are a big part of IGT’s business — emphasis on “big” — with the company showing its Peak65 cabinet with a “Wheel of Fortune” game. It’s part of IGT’s Peak family of hardware in which the number represents the screen size in this case a 65-inch progressively curved display.

Meanwhile Scientific Games Corp. plans to emphasize the future of gaming with its display of iGaming content and platform with a mix of popular games its Mural and Kascada cabinets and its Player Boutique and iView player engagement systems.

“Excitement has been building for months now as our teams crafted a product lineup to showcase this year at G2E” said Barry Cottle president and CEO of Scientific. “After months of virtual gatherings we’re ready to get together safely and to show everyone what we’ve been working on.”

Company displays

Other companies have big plans.

Aristocrat Gaming will show new evolutions of its Mighty Cash Ultra 88 and Gold Stacks 88 and new innovations of Jackpot Catcher Triple Supreme and Wild Fireball Rumble.

JCM Global will show off guest experience enhancements with its DSS Flex and DSS Max R video walls secure bill validators its Gen5 thermal printers and an assortment of high-speed cash transaction systems.

Gary Platt Manufacturing will display its seating solutions to maximize guest comfort. The company delivered some of its most recent work to Resorts World Las Vegas.

“As they say ‘The show must go on.’” Bussmann said. “Now is not the time even with the current restrictions in place by the governor to push back G2E to not host meetings and conventions when they can be done in a safe environment. It’s a staple to the Las Vegas economy and the industry needs to continue its leadership to show how other sectors can follow.”

Each of these risks must be addressed but their roots and remedies are entirely different.

Defense and national security

Beginning several decades ago two things transformed the semiconductor industry and have put the defense and aerospace sectors at risk. First semiconductor manufacturers by the dozens abandoned these markets to pursue the higher volumes of commercially-driven consumer applications. Then to more cost-effectively support these higher volumes they transitioned to subcontracted overseas manufacturing mainly in Taiwan and China.

The first issue is as concerning as the second. Simultaneous with the U.S. share of global semiconductor manufacturing dropping from 37% in 1990 to 12% today there has been equally alarming drop in the number of the U.S. companies who design and supply these mission-critical semiconductors.

Industry consolidation accounted for some of the decline. Most of this consolidation has led to a de-emphasis of Department of Defense (DoD) NASA and other government engagements since accretive acquisitions typically result in cuts to these generally peripheral portions of the acquiring company’s business. Microelectronics suppliers were also being lured to more lucrative commercial state-of-the-art (SOTA) opportunities and today the number of semiconductor companies with a meaningful defense sector businesses has shrunk dramatically.

This dearth of suppliers is as much of a risk to the U.S. defense and aerospace sector as the offshoring of so much U.S. semiconductor manufacturing to China and Taiwan which became an even greater concern after he trade war with China began. This was followed by increasing aggression in the South China Sea and Hong Kong and the actions and statements made by the Chinese Communist Party in the early stages of the pandemic. U.S. policy needs to address both the commercial and DoD sector issues by creating an environment that incentivizes private investment for onshore manufacturing – not just of SOTA components but also mission-critical semiconductors.

An important first step is the bi-partisan American Foundries Act and its successful addition in July 2020 as an amendment to the Senate’s Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which also includes provisions of the original bipartisan CHIPS for America Act for semiconductor incentive and R&D programs that was authorized but never funded. Also important is the Endless Frontier Act that was expanded in May 2021 and renamed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA). It includes $52 billion in emergency funding to implement the CHIPS Act and allocates $2 billion to “solely focus on legacy chip production to advance economic and national security interests as these chips are essential to the auto industry the military and other critical industries.” The price tag on the bill at one point ballooned to over $250 billion which has caused it to slow down for further debate prior to being passed in the Senate.

The next step is to change the NDAA language so that it also includes the mission-critical and integration-level semiconductors required for military and aerospace applications. This addition would better support the fragile global supply chain for Pentagon-military and space qualified semiconductor manufacturing applications and integration. This qualification process is substantially more rigorous than that in the commercial sector. For instance devices like field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) used in for onboard satellite payload processing need to be qualified to reliability specifications geared to extremely harsh space environments. The same is true of military and space-qualified discrete semiconductors that are the staples of weapons and space system platforms. In some cases they are 60 years old but still desperately needed by both prime and sub-prime contractors.

Fewer and fewer companies supply these products or are even capable of meeting their qualification requirements which creates the potential for looming capacity and capability constraints. In short the military and aerospace market simply does not have the sales volumes to support the continuing technology investment required to attract suppliers. U.S. policymakers must address the massive resulting gaps that have created today’s shrinking military and aerospace electronics supply chain.

Commercial sector

The commercial sector shortage has continued to worsen and the current order rate is outpacing the capacity that semiconductor companies can bring on board. It is a constraint the industry will likely see through the rest of the year most likely into 2022.

The issues that created this crisis have been brewing for some time dating back to late 2018 and early 2019 when tariffs started to create headwinds for many customers. They could not absorb the tariffs and their end consumers could not bear the prices so demand went down in 2019. And then as things began to improve and supply chains realigned so that products destined for the United States could be built outside of China the industry was hit by the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic through the first half of 2020. It added to the demand slide especially in the automotive industrial and consumer sectors. Everyone stopped buying.

As the slowdown happened companies leaned out inventories and started to idle factories to run less than what they could normally produce. Moving forward through the slowdown manufacturers could not get a demand signal from their customers that provided enough warning to start up manufacturing again. This is problematic for an industry where it takes six months of cycle time from when there is a “go” signal as there was in September 2020 to when factories can be ramped up and/or capital investments can be made to expand capacity and production can begin to return to full force again. The industry has had to catch up from where it was back in late 2019 and early 2020.

Today’s supply issues are exacerbated by manufacturers who compete over the same fab capacity. This can be tracked back to the transition from vertical integration to predominately fabless manufacturing. As fab construction costs skyrocketed many semiconductor companies moved to a “fab-lite” model shifting their resources to chip design. They produced some chips in their own fabs while outsourcing some production to foundries. Some went fabless or they exited the business. Then the 2001 recession hastened an industry contraction which launched a consolidation chapter while also accelerating offshoring. The result has been a much weaker industry ecosystem today that was far more vulnerable to the whipsaw impact of the recent pandemic.

Policy priorities

The commercial sector will continue to see supply and demand imbalances resulting from normal economic cycles. But there are also policy initiatives in the medium to long term that will be important to support a stronger U.S. semiconductor infrastructure including both R&D and manufacturing capability. The biggest issue is the manufacturing side which will likely take at least three years to address once government initiatives are launched. Meanwhile it will likely take at least 6-8 quarters to resolve the commercial shortage not just in automotive but across all end markets.

To ensure availability of microelectronics for U.S. defense aerospace and homeland security needs policymakers need to consider the special circumstances of this increasingly fragile dedicated supply chain. Modifying the NDAA bill to include support specifically for mission-critical and integration-level semiconductor suppliers is a first step toward shoring up a shrinking supplier base so it can continue to provide components that pass the rigorous qualification tests that ensure they can be used in much harsher environments for much longer periods of time than the typical commercial semiconductor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDIxLTEwLWdyYXBoZW5lLW1pcmFjbGUtbWF0ZXJpYWwtc2luZ2xlZC1jb3ZpZC5odG1s0gFJaHR0cHM6Ly9waHlzLm9yZy9uZXdzLzIwMjEtMTAtZ3JhcGhlbmUtbWlyYWNsZS1tYXRlcmlhbC1zaW5nbGVkLWNvdmlkLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Graphene: 'Miracle material' singled out for COVID conspiracies,"Graphic on the characteristics of graphene the material of the future?

Graphene a Nobel Prize-awarded material with promising applications for greener energy and nanomedicine has been the topic of much disinformation by coronavirus anti-vaxxers claiming it can be used to ""magnetize"" and ""control"" people.

What is graphene?

Often referred to as a ""miracle material"" graphene is one of the world's strongest materials and one of the lightest.

A form of carbon just one atom thick—many times thinner than a human hair—graphene is transparent but stronger than steel.

It was aired as a theoretical substance in 1947 but for decades physicists thought it would be impossible to isolate.

The problem was resolved in 2004 by scientists Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov who used ordinary sticky tape to lift a layer from a piece of graphite—the stuff in pencil lead.

That layer was itself pulled apart using more tape and the process repeated until just the thinnest of layers remained—a graphene sheet.

In 2010 the pair received the Nobel Physics Prize for their efforts.

Graphene a super conductor of heat and electric energy is ""among the most promising materials for technologies of the future"" Argentine chemistry researcher Marcelo Mariscal a specialist in nanotechnology told AFP.

It is the focus of research into the manufacturing of ultra-strong but lightweight and flexible electronic devices satellites airplanes and cars greener alternatives to batteries and a delivery vehicle for gene or molecular therapy—potentially also for use in vaccines.

What is the link to COVID-19 vaccines?

As has been the case with 5G and microchip technology graphene has been the subject of several ""trojan horse"" conspiracy theories according to which governments or powerful individuals are supposedly seeking to remotely ""control"" people who receive some sort of mini device through coronavirus vaccines or track their whereabouts through GPS.

This control could be exercised from 5G towers transmitting signals to people supposedly carrying graphene particles one theory goes.

In another widely-disseminated claim social media users alleged they had been ""magnetized"" by the vaccine posting images of magnets coins or cutlery allegedly attached to the arm in which they received the jab.

Some conspiracy theorists have claimed that vaccines containing graphene have altered people's ""electromagnetic field"" and that this can be fatal.

What is the truth?

To start with none of the vaccines approved for use by the World Health Organization contain graphene or its derivative graphene oxide.

Conspiracies were fueled when Canada in April recalled certain anti-coronavirus facemasks with a graphene layer over concerns that inhaled particles inhaled could cause asbestos-like lung damage.

In July their sale was resumed after a review found that ""biomass graphene particles are not shed from these masks in quantities that are likely to cause adverse lung effects.""

Experts also dispute the alleged magnetizing properties of graphene.

The material ""is magnetic only in very specific laboratory conditions"" Diego Pena of the Spanish Research Centre for Biological Chemistry and Molecular Materials told AFP.

A video of a brain autopsy widely circulated on social media as evidence of the alleged lethal effects of graphene in a vaccinated person was in fact from a patient with bleeding on the brain and filmed before COVID-19 was even identified.

Experts say the hype about graphene's promising applications—most of them still in the research phase—have contributed to it being a popular target for disinformation.

""The material is known everyone knows it's real but not everyone understand how it works"" said Ester Vazquez Fernandez-Pacheco director of the Regional Institute for Applied Scientific Research (IRICA) in Spain.

It is therefore ""very easy to make people believe things that have no scientific basis.""

Now a new video shows that it’s possible to replace the screen and make facial recognition work but it’s not simple.

When we covered the original Phone Repair Guru video he said that even when you replace your iPhone 13 screen for another original display a message saying “Unable to verify this iPhone has a genuine Apple display” appeared.

He then suggested that there are some workarounds like other parts to the new screen but that most repair shops wouldn’t do that because it’s “too sophisticated.”

With that in mind iCorrect a UK third-party repair shop proved that it’s possible to replace the iPhone 13 screen without losing Face ID but indeed it’s a very sophisticated process.

In a blog post iCorrect explains why Face ID is disabled on the iPhone 13 when replacing the screen and also gives context ever since Apple introduce this technology with the iPhone X:

“From our research the iPhone communicates with the screen through a microchip embedded on the screen. This screen microchip is an integrated circuit (an assembly of electronic components fabricated into a single unit) responsible for translating your analog touch (your finger pressing on your screen creating an analog signal) to a digital signal (for your iPhone to understand as your iPhone is a mini-computer and doesn’t understand analog signals) (…) The iPhone 13’s screen IC now not only acts as a ADC enables True Tone carries a ROM for the non-genuine message but also now communicates with Face ID. We believe this communication with Face ID is a bug in iOS15. But it shows us a glimpse of how much more complex the screen IC is going to be in the future. We expect the next generations of iPhone to contain 2 biometrics in Face ID & in screen Touch ID. We expect when replacing a screen in future will disable the in screen Touch ID.“

Although our last take about Apple’s doing this was regarding the controversy about the Right to Repair law iCorrect has a different perspective of why the Cupertino company is so picky about third-party repair shops:

“In my opinion and something which I can’t comment on for the whole industry is that this is not a fight with third party repair this is Apple’s fight with China. We as consumers and repairers are just caught in the middle. Apple designs beautiful technology outside and in they have it produced in China who then disassemble the technology and manufacture alternative parts. Apple is using their own genius against the Chinese by blocking aftermarket parts. Unfortunately it also means that they also block the usage of their own parts. That genius by big tech manufacturers can be seen as control through serialisation of parts as discussed today. This move to disable Face ID was originally seen as a checkmate move by Apple but today I’m happy to be reporting that this is only check.“

You can watch his seven-minute video showing the same as Phone Repair Guru and then how to replace the screen while maintaining Face ID on the iPhone 13:",,,,,,

""Right now every single end market for semiconductors is up simultaneously; I've been in this industry 27 years I've never seen that happen"" said Marvell CEO Matt Murphy during a CNBC Technology Executive Council event on Thursday. ""If it stays business as usual and everything's up and to the right this is going to be a very painful period including in 2022 for the duration of the year.""

While several chip producers have announced plans to expand factory capacity Murphy who noted his firm is fabless and works with contract manufacturers on its designs said ""that's not going to kick in until 2023 and 2024 — so there's this painful period.""

That is a more pessimistic view than some of Murphy's chip industry peers who have recently said they expect the shortage to wane next year as new factories open.

""We've always gone through cycles of ups and downs where demand has exceeded supply or vice versa"" AMD CEO Lisa Su said Monday at the Code Conference in Beverly Hills California. ""This time it's different.""

Su said that while she expects the first half of 2022 to be ""likely tight"" the second half will be less severe as manufacturing capacity opens.

""It might take you know 18 to 24 months to put on a new plant and in some cases even longer than that"" Su said. ""These investments were started perhaps a year ago.""

AMD rival Intel is one of the companies that has looked to double down on manufacturing announcing in March that it would invest $20 billion in two new chip factories in Arizona.

TSMC  which is the biggest manufacturer of semiconductors on contract and works with companies including Marvell is also building a $12 billion factory in Arizona. The company announced in April that it would invest $100 billion over the next three years to increase factory capacity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm9sb2d5Lm5ld3MveHR1cmEtaW50ZWdyYXRlcy10YXJnZXRsZXNzLXBob3RvZ3JhbW1ldHJ5LXNjYW5uZXItdG8ta3VrYS1yb2JvdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,XTURA Integrates Targetless Photogrammetry Scanner To KUKA Robot – Metrology and Quality News - Online ...,"Robots have been integrated with inspection systems for many years where automated repetitive inspection is required typically in-line production environments.

One of the historical challenges however for these combined technologies has been the lack of accuracy of the industrial robot. While industrial robot accuracy is absolutely fine for general assembly automation process needs metrology by definition operates on a different scale all together.

What this can mean in practice is that highly accurate measurement systems attached to the end of a less accurate industrial robot inevitably lose some of their potential capability unless additional components are brought into the system. Perhaps this could mean tracking of the scanner head applying surface mounted targets to the subject being captured or limiting the inspection to single ‘disconnected’ viewpoints rather than the whole part all combined.

Other surface capture (targetless) photogrammetry solutions do exist. These are however predominantly used for creating 3D models for ‘CGI’ visualisation purposes or perhaps measurement at the scale of multiple mm perhaps good enough for building survey or stock-pile volume measurement but certainly not suitable for engineering inspection which requires micron level accuracy.

GigaScan Technologies (Xtura’s R&D dept.) has resolved this final challenge through its proprietary calibration process combined with unique processing algorithms. XTURA have been developing GigaScan for over 8 years with the intent to create a highly flexible automated inspection 3D scanning technology based on Photogrammetry not only offering improved accuracy when compared to other metrology solutions but also including all the advantages that targetless photogrammetry provides.

“GigaScan Technologies produce highly accurate automated measurements from photographs that enable the precise calculation of the geometry of an object. Photography is the projection of a 3D scene onto a 2D plane which results in the loss of depth information. The goal of GigaScan technologies is to reverse this process.” states Patrik Folkesson founder of Xtura AB.

On a recent test project with KUKA GigaScan blended and applied the capabilities of the two respective technologies to industrial inspection application by successfully integrating the XT series 3D Scanner onto a KUKA industrial robot.

Overall the Surface Pro 8 is the better choice for most people thanks to its cutting-edge CPUs capable integrated graphics LTE option better ports and lower price. With that said don't overlook the Surface Book 3 if you're in need of a device with lots of GPU power. It may not have the best processors or ports but it's got enough juice in the graphics department to power everything from gaming to advanced 3D rendering.

Surface Pro 8 vs. Book 3: Processing or graphics?

Source: Microsoft (Image credit: Source: Microsoft)

The main difference between the Surface Pro 8 and the Surface Book 3 is that the former has top-of-the-line processors while the latter can be outfitted with some beefy graphics horsepower. The Surface Pro 8 has a wide range of 11th Gen Intel CPUs available that outperform the Book 3's 10th Gen options but the Book 3 can be configured with powerful GPUs like the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti and the NVIDIA Quadro RTX 3000. The integrated Intel Xe Graphics in the Surface Pro 8 are better than the Book 3's aging Intel Iris Plus integrated graphics but if you're serious about getting a strong GPU for gaming video editing or 3D rendering work the Surface Book 3 is the clear winner. Both devices can be configured with up to 32GB of RAM and both have excellent touch displays with high resolutions and quality color gamuts.

Outside of the CPU and GPU department the Surface Pro 8 comes out on top with its modern ports which notably includes Thunderbolt 4. The Pro 8 can also be outfitted with LTE connectivity for more effective mobile usage and it also has a considerably lower price tag overall. The Surface Book 3 has a few advantages too — namely an option for a 2TB SSD and a slightly better battery life — but we ultimately feel that unless you have a specific need for a powerful dedicated GPU in your laptop you should get the Surface Pro 8.

Surface Pro 8 vs. Book 3: Which should you buy?

Source: Daniel Rubino / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Daniel Rubino / Windows Central)

Both the Surface Pro 8 and the Surface Book 3 are incredibly attractive devices that are sure to make anyone happy but between them we think that the Surface Pro 8 will be the better choice for most people since the improved performance of its 11th Gen Intel processors will be very valuable for productivity and recreation. It also has Intel's advanced Xe integrated graphics available which are strong enough to handle everything from the basics to light gaming and media editing. It's also got modern Thunderbolt 4 ports and a lower price too.

Don't overlook the Surface Book 3 if you need a specialized Surface that packs lots of GPU horsepower however. Its 10th Gen Intel CPUs aren't as good as the 11th Gen ones found in the Surface Pro 8 but its various NVIDIA GPU options crush the Surface Pro 8's Intel Xe integrated graphics when it comes to serious gaming and advanced video editing or 3D rendering tasks. It can also be configured with more storage and has a slightly better battery life as well.

That’s a little less common but it’s happening.

Microsoft Office 2021 is due for release on October 5 for Windows and macOS systems. Among the (many) new features Microsoft is talking about is Office 2021’s support for the OpenDocument Format (ODF) 1.3.

“The ODF 1.3 format (using the file extensions .odt .ods and .odp) is supported in Word Excel and PowerPoint alongside the Office Open XML (OOXML) format (which uses file extensions .docx .xlsx and .pptx)” Microsoft’s Alfred Hellstern explains:

He adds: “This change means that Office apps will now save to the ODF 1.3 format only. ODF 1.2 and earlier files can be opened but will be saved as 1.3. Products that only support the 1.2 format such as older versions of Office can open a file saved in the 1.3 format but won’t support the new features when saved”.

Office 2021 includes many new features

OpenDocument formats are (finally) becoming more ubiquitous in everyday life — Microsoft going out of its way to support the latest spec in its latest office suite is evidence to that.

Why? Well it is isn’t solely down to millions of desktop Ubuntu tapping away in LibreOffice et al. While home user’s activities are important the surge in use of open file formats in businesses organisations and governmental bodies around the world is a factor.

We’ve all heard tales of councils and municipalities switching away from closed-source (and pricey) proprietary file formats in favour of cheaper equivalent open standards.

Better support for open file formats in Office doesn’t just give Office users a hand but helps ensure those using ODF files don’t hit hurdles in sharing files with companies or organisations that do rely on Microsoft products.

Get Office 2021

FOSS-friendly file formats

Office Home and Student 2021 costs from $149.99 (US) for macOS and Windows 10 and the newly released Windows 11. It includes Word Excel PowerPoint OneNote and Microsoft Teams for PC and Mac.

Office Home and Business 2021 costs from $249.99 (US) and includes all of the above plus Outlook for PC and Mac and ‘the right to use the apps for business purposes’.

Both versions are available to buy worldwide from October 5 2021 direct from Microsoft and other online retailers.

It comes with plenty of fantastic features especially for those using Microsoft apps. It isn't perfect however so we'll break down the full service to help you decide if it's right for you.

As a leading brand in the tech space Microsoft puts its fingers in many digital pies. One of those pies is cloud storage with Microsoft offering the world OneDrive. The software has evolved a lot over the years. As features advance we want to keep you up to speed — and that’s exactly what we’re going to do in this extensive OneDrive review. Key Takeaways: OneDrive is a fast and reliable cloud storage solution.

It’s the perfect option for those already using other Microsoft apps.

Privacy is where OneDrive drops the ball with the lack of zero-knowledge encryption.

Overall Microsoft OneDrive is a good choice for both students and professionals. In a world filled with options for cloud storage what makes OneDrive an attractive option for consumers? It has plenty of useful features which we will get into; however the main selling point is the level of integration. Services like Office Skype OneNote and Outlook are integrated into the OneDrive platform. This allows you to create documents and have team calls without having to leave OneDrive. Although Microsoft OneDrive has fast reliable performance and plenty of features it does have a major flaw: privacy. The service is lacking zero-knowledge encryption which opens the door to unwanted access. That said Microsoft is slowly implementing features that make accounts more secure and man-in-the-middle attacks more difficult (more on that later). Despite its flaws OneDrive still makes it onto our list of best cloud storage services and there are plenty of reasons why. Let’s take a look. Show all Meet the experts Learn more about our editorial team and our research process.

Strengths & Weaknesses Pros: Office 365 integration

Good document collaboration

Large variety of features

Fast file syncing Cons: No zero-knowledge security

Limited file versioning

Limited customer support

Features 90 % – Excellent If you use Office tools such as Word and Excel you’ll appreciate having the ability to create and edit documents directly in OneDrive which automatically saves those files to the cloud. Gaining access to these productivity tools make OneDrive one of the best cloud storage for students and professionals. There’s one slight downside: the number of tools at your disposal depends on the plan you’re on: the more you pay the more you get. You’ll need a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family subscription to be able to download Office and use it with OneDrive on your PC but standard OneDrive users have free access to the mobile and web apps. Similar services are available if you’re using another operating system such as macOS with OneDrive for Mac users getting a similar experience. If you’re a business user you can combine OneDrive with other Microsoft tools like Microsoft SharePoint to become a one-stop shop for all of your essential business documents. It’s also why OneDrive is one of the top recommendations on our best cloud storage for collaboration short list. Read our SharePoint vs OneDrive guide to learn how the two differ. Aiming to separate itself from the pack OneDrive offers what it calls a “personal vault.” You can add your most precious files to your vault and access them only with a unique code or your fingerprint. It’s an extra step for you but an added layer of security when fending off cyberattacks. Free OneDrive users as well as users with 100GB of storage space can save up to three files in their personal vault. You’ll need to purchase a better subscription to store more files up to your standard space limit. Microsoft OneDrive PC Backups To keep your files safe and updated OneDrive allows you to automatically backup your desktop folders documents and pictures. While it’s a great feature it doesn’t provide a full system backup. Those looking to backup everything on their system should consider Backblaze which you can learn more about in our full Backblaze review. Beyond automatic backups you can also sync and share files from your desktop by simply adding them to your OneDrive folder. Doing so allows you to access your files on different devices as long as you have access to your OneDrive account. File Restore If you do lose access to your account you can take advantage of OneDrive’s “files restore” recovery feature. This was previously limited to OneDrive for Business users but it’s now been expanded to all users with a paid OneDrive or Microsoft 365 subscription. OneDrive Files on Demand OneDrive’s “files on-demand” allows users to keep files in the cloud to free up space on their hard drive. This gives you the option to download and access files only when you need them which you can do through the desktop app. It’s a valuable feature especially if you find that you’re jumping between devices a lot while you’re working (such as between home and work). With OneDrive’s files-on-demand feature you can edit files from your PC as if they were stored locally picking up where you left off on another device with ease. Real-Time Collaboration All OneDrive subscribers can take advantage of document collaboration — after all it’s OneDrive’s winning feature. However other services such as Google Drive and Google Docs offer similar collaboration features as our Google Drive review will explain. Using OneDrive you and your collaborators can edit a compatible document together in real time. Any changes you make will be seen immediately by everyone looking at the file. It’s a great tool for reviewing documents or going over notes and you can keep track of what edits are made and by whom. Features like these make OneDrive a sensible cloud storage solution for document creation whether it’s for work or school. Built-In Image Scanner Lastly a cool feature we like is the built-in image scanner. Users simply tap the camera tab to scan documents business cards and photos. This feature is not unique to OneDrive but it’s good that Microsoft recognizes the usefulness of this simple feature.

Ease of Use 90 % – Excellent The best word to describe OneDrive is “polished.” For Windows users OneDrive aims to edge past its cloud storage competition by having it preinstalled on your computer. While there’s nothing to prevent you from installing a different provider having it ready to go makes it easier to get set up. On both Windows and MacOS operating systems Microsoft OneDrive exists as a folder on your computer. You’ll be prompted to log in with your Microsoft account on first use but from there you can upload files simply by adding or saving them to your OneDrive folder. Like Dropbox and other major cloud storage services OneDrive uses a single-sync directory with its own subfolders and files on Windows PCs. The contents of this directory are then stored online and require no extra effort to backup. Your OneDrive files automatically take up space on your hard drive. However this is where you can implement the files-on-demand feature and select which files you want to exist only in the cloud. The downside is that if you lose your internet connection you won’t be able to access any files that you haven’t set up to be accessible offline. The OneDrive web app is a good option for those who don’t wish to use the desktop app. The web user interface is simple and easy to navigate and it will offer no surprises to Microsoft users. You can drag files onto the page to upload them and download files you need by right-clicking the file. You can also use the web interface to quickly change your settings start Skype calls and access OneDrive’s help menu. Like other Microsoft web products you can easily access other services like Office 365 or Outlook from the top-left menu icon. OneDrive Mobile Cloud Storage Solution OneDrive for mobile is available on Android and iOS. It comes with most of the features included in the web and desktop applications. However Microsoft has done well to keep it as simple as possible for mobile users. You can quickly view your recent files or see a full overview of your stored files and folders allowing you to download files for an offline view. Additionally the mobile apps for OneDrive give you the option to automatically upload the photos and videos that you take. This is handy especially if you lose your phone because your content will be safely backed up for you to restore elsewhere. You can also switch to the “shared” tab to set up or view content you’ve shared with other OneDrive users.

File Sharing & Sync 85 % – Very Good File syncing and sharing is important for any cloud storage provider and it’s something that OneDrive does particularly well (though we do have a guide for if OneDrive is not syncing). The sync folder functions similarly to Dropbox offering a specific location for files and folders on your hard drive that are synced with Microsoft’s servers. If you’re curious check out our Dropbox review to learn a little more about how that service works and the similarities it shares with OneDrive. If you have a file that exists outside the locations that OneDrive natively selects you can right-click on that file and click the “move to OneDrive” option. This works only with files though. If you want to move a folder you will need to manually cut and paste that folder into the sync location that’s automatically created with OneDrive. Sharing a file in OneDrive is as easy as right-clicking on the file and pressing “share” to get started. From there OneDrive will open a menu allowing you to select who you want to share your files with or you can copy the link to your clipboard to share elsewhere. The web application also has the same sharing functionality. You can create shareable links and add user permissions and Premium users can set link expiration dates for added security. Some may prefer Google Drive for sharing files especially if they use Google’s productivity tools. However OneDrive works perfectly well as a solution for file and folder sharing.

Speed 90 % – Excellent OneDrive has impressive upload and download speeds. Although it doesn’t perform as well as Dropbox its performance times are nothing to scoff at. We uploaded a 5GB unzipped folder filled with various file types. Our internet speed was 100 Mbps from a virtual Windows machine based in Ireland. Overall our experience with the speed of syncing files was very positive as indicated by the data transfer times below. 1st attempt: 2nd attempt: Average: Upload 0:09:25 0:09:00 0:09:12 Download 0:07:20 0:07:18 0:07:19 OneDrive does support block-level file copying (which it calls “differential sync”) to make it easier to quickly edit files without fully uploading them again. It was once reserved only for Microsoft Office file types such as DOCX but it now supports all file types. However it is only available to those on a business plan.

Security 70 % – Decent To keep your files safe OneDrive uses 256-bit encryption both in transit and at rest. Unfortunately OneDrive loses points because it is not a zero-knowledge provider meaning it can access users’ encryption keys; OneDrive employees middle-men and the authorities all have the potential to view your files. In the event of a data breach OneDrive has an automated notification service to alert you which is a useful feature. Once notified you can use any connected device to restore compromised files change your password and activate additional OneDrive security features. The addition of two-factor authentication also helps keep your data secured from unauthorized logins. It’s a nice inclusion and — as with all of the features of OneDrive — it’s easy to set up and use especially if you’re already using the Microsoft Authenticator app to secure your account. Microsoft is slowly implementing passwordless access to user accounts across all its platforms. Rather than input a password (that hackers can potentially access) users can log in with a unique code each time they access their account. The long term goal is to move away from passwords and two-step authentication. How well it will work is yet to be determined. We briefly covered OneDrive’s personal vault feature earlier in this review offering a way for users to add extra security and protection to their files. It’s a nice idea but don’t be fooled: it doesn’t encrypt your files. However it can add additional layers of protection such as two-factor authentication to sensitive documents to stop hackers from gaining access to them so easily.

Privacy 70 % – Decent Ideas like the OneDrive personal vault are clever but they mask a fairly middling focus on privacy from one of the world’s largest technology firms. Microsoft talks a big talk but the truth is a little murkier. U.S.-based firms have a distinct disadvantage when it comes to privacy. Companies like Microsoft have a legal requirement to engage with law enforcement if asked to do so with laws like the CLOUD Act making it impossible for a U.S. service to refuse the request. If the United States government wants your data it’s going to get it. With that in mind you need to remember that it doesn’t matter what features OneDrive has to help keep your data private because Microsoft will hand it all over if the law directs it to do so. You have some control over your data though with the Microsoft privacy dashboard letting you view and clear certain content such as your browsing data. However for OneDrive users there isn’t a huge amount to offer here. You could delete your account but Microsoft will keep your data for up to 180 days. The options are pretty limited for direct control over your data but you can opt out of some Microsoft privacy tracking including the ability to stop personalized ads across your account. You may be able to tweak your Windows 10 privacy settings to further limit this level of data tracking. Overall if you’re really worried about privacy you probably don’t want to host your data with services that are based in one of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing nations such as the United States.

Customer Service 70 % – Decent OneDrive has an underwhelming support service for its users. There’s a general support line but getting to the right person for a quick solution is cumbersome. There’s also no live chat which is disappointing considering other cloud storage providers offer this feature. Users can access community forums and check out how-to articles. However if the answer you’re looking for isn’t there your only option is to email OneDrive. Response times were fairly quick but took longer than two hours. That’s no good for anyone needing immediate support. The company’s community forums offer a useful resource for users. This vault of question-and-answer posts covers a number of unusual queries and issues but it isn’t as active as you might think. However it is staffed by helpful support agents and volunteers with relatively quick response times. If the forum doesn’t help Microsoft does offer a chatbot that can guide you to common answers support articles or links to different parts of the site that you may have missed. If this doesn’t answer your query you can request to speak to a live support agent but you may need to wait in a queue before you can speak to someone.

The Verdict As far as cloud storage goes there’s little to complain about with Microsoft OneDrive. The price is reasonable the performance is impressive and the ease of using Microsoft apps makes it an attractive choice. When it comes to finding a space to store your files sync collaborate and share OneDrive hangs with the best of them. It’s an ideal option for students professionals and business users. Privacy and customer support are the two areas that make us consider looking elsewhere. If you want only the best privacy for your files OneDrive isn’t for you; you should instead check out pCloud Sync.com Icedrive or MEGA all which rank about OneDrive in our best cloud storage article. However if you don’t mind potential eyes on your files and just need a reliable fast feature-stacked cloud service OneDrive gives you everything you need. What did you think of our Microsoft OneDrive review? Do you use OneDrive and do you think our assessment is fair? What other cloud solutions do you currently have your eye on? We would love to hear about it. Let us know in the comments below. Thanks for reading. FAQ Is OneDrive Any Good? Microsoft OneDrive is an excellent option for all types of users. Beyond cloud storage OneDrive also excels at document creation and collaboration plus it’s pretty affordable.

What Are the Disadvantages of Using OneDrive? The main disadvantage of using OneDrive is the lack of privacy. While your files are kept safe through encryption that lack of zero-knowledge means Microsoft can access and share your data should it deem it justifiable.

Which Is Better: Dropbox or OneDrive? For those already familiar with the Microsoft ecosystem OneDrive is the way to go especially if you use Office. However Dropbox offers plenty of integrated third-party applications that some users may find more attractive. For a more in-depth breakdown check out our OneDrive vs Dropbox head-to-head."

Getting more people vaccinated is critical to any hope of ending the pandemic’s hold over us. And helping more people with diabetes keep their symptoms under control is essential to improving their quality of life and lowering health care costs for everyone.

Ohio’s Medicaid Managed Care plans have put a high priority on both of these issues and those efforts have taught an important lesson: Tackling persistent hard-to-budge public health problems is a team sport. By working together the six private insurance companies that handle most of Ohio’s Medicaid business are having more success than they could working alone.

On the COVID-19 front the plans have agreed on a broad suite of outreach efforts to encourage more Medicaid members to get the vaccination. The most prominent feature is a $100 gift card available to any member who receives the first vaccination shot by Dec. 31.

Dr. Melissa Li-Ng is an endocrinologist and medical director for international operations and medical operations at the Cleveland Clinic.

At the Cleveland Clinic we’re adding to this with our own initiatives — encouraging patients face-to-face or virtually to get vaccinated; spreading the message in printed materials and online; hosting town halls; and providing on-site vaccination clinics for some large employers.

Regarding diabetes the plans have agreed on a common strategy: Teaching members how to manage their disease and making it easier to get the supplies to do so. Underlying all this is a decision by the Ohio Department of Medicaid to cover the expense of Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) — instruction and counseling on healthy eating and weight management as well as using a glucose meter insulin pen and other tools.

There are gift card programs for selected diabetes patients and providers too centered on the twin goals of more blood sugar testing by patients and better results for those tests. A Medicaid patient with diabetes who has no such test (called the A1c) on record will receive a $25 gift card for getting a test by Dec. 31.

Diabetic patients whose previous A1c test had a reading higher than 9% will receive a $50 gift card if they have another test before Dec. 31 and their reading improves to below 9.

The two conditions are undoubtedly linked. We know that diabetic patients who contract COVID-19 are more likely to be hospitalized and their recovery is much more difficult. The infection can cause drastic fluctuations in blood sugar.

Getting more Medicaid members vaccinated and enabling more to control their diabetes will bring a meaningful improvement in the quality of life for these patients.

Dr. Kimberly Chen is chief medical officer for Molina Healthcare of Ohio.

It’s too early to measure results of the diabetes push but we’re encouraged by the vaccination campaign. Gov. Mike DeWine urged the Medicaid plans in June to ramp up their efforts. The Department of Medicaid later said that between then and Aug. 8 the number of adult Medicaid members who had completed vaccination grew by 57%.

There’s still a long way to go; as of Sept. 21 according to the Department of Medicaid only 29% of Ohioans in the Medicaid Managed Care plans were fully vaccinated. But that number is significantly higher than the 24% of Medicaid Ohioans overall — a clear sign that the Managed Care plans’ efforts have worked.

Given the difficulty all communities are having with encouraging COVID vaccinations this success is real. Ohio faces plenty of public health challenges including obesity heart disease and smoking that COVID makes worse.

To move the needle on those and others collaboration among health care plans providers and the state clearly is a model worth following.

gentle monster continues to redefine the idea of conventional commercial spaces with their new store in shanghai. dubbed haus shanghai the new vision encompasses more than a commercial experience by delivering a provocative cultural approach which continues with the brand’s evolution blending retail exhibition and experimentation spaces.

encompassing a total of 3270 square meters divided among four floors the complex features gentle monster’s largest store to date together with its fragrance brand tamburin and their surreal dessert brand called nudake.

HAUS SHANGHAI IS A MULTIBRAND CONCEPT STORE BY GENTLE MONSTER

following haus dossan in seoul (read more on designboom here) gentle monster has opened its second flagship store — haus shanghai. here visitors are welcomed by the brand’s signature the probe – a six-legged walking robot which has been created by their own robotic lab. the tarantula-like automaton is joined by an installation of horses with mechanical tails that move from side to side which capture nudake’s spirit of experimentation and fantasy. the food and beverage experience is enhanced through the addition of collage media art and monochromatic furniture that contrasts with warm wood tones.

ART DESIGN AND RETAIL ARE COMBINED INTO AN EXPERIMENTAL & PROVOCATIVE EXPERIENCE

on the second floor visitors encounter gentle monster’s largest store to date. a blue interior mixed with oversized pictures and tenacious artworks create an unexpected circulation inside the space. and in fact gentle monster defies the traditional layouts of commercial spaces which prioritize efficiency and function by exemplifying here their idea of what retail should be in the future. aptly called circulation the theme of the space brings together different installations and artworks that result in both visual and auditory stimulations which create tension and rhythm throughout the space.

the third floor has been dedicated to a large exhibition space featuring the brand’s curated media art exhibitions and collaboration pop-ups. set within the center of the floor a gigantic robot face expands the giant who arrived at the bird village theme. the somehow eerie oversize face robot sculpture depicts the bird village together with other sculptures and installations.

By Anna J. Park



So far this year Morgan Stanley has been enjoying the top position among finance companies providing advisory services to local companies going through mergers and acquisitions (M&As).



Morgan Stanley is more than 3 trillion won ($2.5 billion) ahead of JPMorgan which has been in the second position in the M&A advisory market so far this year in terms of the total value of M&A deals they have made based on their advisory services. So it is highly likely that Morgan Stanley will maintain its top position until the end of this year.



The $4 billion acquisition deal for Korea's top food delivery app Baemin is the main reason Morgan Stanley has been the top player in the local M&A advisory market this year.



Morgan Stanley also advised on other major M&A deals including the sale of global communication platform Hyperconnect to U.S.-based Match Group the sale of Samsung Display's LCD factory in China to CSOT and the sale of Job Korea to Affinity Equity Partners. The global finance company also advised on another major deal here the sale of eBay Korea for 3.4 trillion won to retailer E-mart.



JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs follow in the top M&A advisory player list as they took the second and third positions in terms of cumulative deals in the first three quarters of this year.



JPMorgan in particular had been shut out of the top 10 list during the first quarter of this year. Yet it jumped to the top three in the second quarter with the completion of major deals including HYBE's acquisition of Ithaca Holdings and the sale of waste management firm Clenco.



The total amount of cumulative M&A deals during the first three quarters of this year reached 54.9 trillion won with 416 deals. This figure is a huge increase from the 35.6 trillion won made from 320 deals logged in the same period of last year.

The secret documents expose offshore dealings of the King of Jordan the presidents of Ukraine Kenya and Ecuador the prime minister of the Czech Republic and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The files also detail financial activities of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “unofficial minister of propaganda” and more than 130 billionaires from Russia the United States Turkey and other nations.

The leaked records reveal that many of the power players who could help bring an end to the offshore system instead benefit from it – stashing assets in covert companies and trusts while their governments do little to slow a global stream of illicit money that enriches criminals and impoverishes nations.

Among the hidden treasures revealed in the documents:

A $22 million chateau in the French Riviera – replete with a cinema and two swimming pools – purchased through offshore companies by the Czech Republic’s populist prime minister a billionaire who has railed against the corruption of economic and political elites.

More than $13 million tucked in a secrecy-shaded trust in the Great Plains of the United States by a scion of one of Guatemala’s most powerful families a dynasty that controls a soap and lipsticks conglomerate that’s been accused of harming workers and the earth.

Three beachfront mansions in Malibu purchased through three offshore companies for $68 million by the King of Jordan in the years after Jordanians filled the streets during Arab Spring to protest joblessness and corruption.

The secret records are known as the Pandora Papers.

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists obtained the trove of more than 11.9 million confidential files and led a team of more than 600 journalists from 150 news outlets that spent two years sifting through them tracking down hard-to-find sources and digging into court records and other public documents from dozens of countries.

The leaked records come from 14 offshore services firms from around the world that set up shell companies and other offshore nooks for clients often seeking to keep their financial activities in the shadows. The records include information about the dealings of nearly three times as many current and former country leaders as any previous leak of documents from offshore havens.

In an era of widening authoritarianism and inequality the Pandora Papers investigation provides an unequaled perspective on how money and power operate in the 21st century – and how the rule of law has been bent and broken around the world by a system of financial secrecy enabled by the U.S. and other wealthy nations.

The findings by ICIJ and its media partners spotlight how deeply secretive finance has infiltrated global politics – and offer insights into why governments and global organizations have made little headway in ending offshore financial abuses.

An ICIJ analysis of the secret documents identified 956 companies in offshore havens tied to 336 high-level politicians and public officials including country leaders cabinet ministers ambassadors and others. More than two-thirds of those companies were set up in the British Virgin Islands a jurisdiction long known as a key cog in the offshore system.

At least $11.3 trillion is held “offshore” according to a 2020 study by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Because of the complexity and secrecy of the offshore system it’s not possible to know how much of that wealth is tied to tax evasion and other crimes and how much of it involves funds that come from legitimate sources and have been reported to proper authorities.

Every corner of the world

The Pandora Papers investigation unmasks the covert owners of offshore companies incognito bank accounts private jets yachts mansions even artworks by Picasso Banksy and other masters – providing more information than what’s usually available to law enforcement agencies and cash-strapped governments.

People linked by the secret documents to offshore assets include India’s cricket superstar Sachin Tendulkar pop music diva Shakira supermodel Claudia Schiffer and an Italian mobster known as “Lell the Fat One.”

The mobster Raffaele Amato has been tied to at least a dozen killings. The documents provide details about a shell company registered in the United Kingdom that Amato used to buy land in Spain shortly before fleeing there from Italy to set up his own crime gang. Amato whose history helped inspire the highly praised movie “Gomorrah” is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

Amato’s attorney did not respond to ICIJ’s request for comment.

Tendulkar’s attorney said the cricket player’s investment is legitimate and has been declared to tax authorities. Shakira’s attorney said the singer declared her companies which the attorney said do not provide tax advantages. Schiffer’s representatives said the supermodel correctly pays her taxes in the U.K. where she lives.

In most countries it’s not illegal to have assets offshore or to use shell companies to do business across national borders. Businesspeople who operate internationally say they need offshore companies to conduct their financial affairs.

But these affairs often amount to shifting profits from high-tax countries where they are earned to companies that exist only on paper in low-tax jurisdictions. Using offshore shelters is especially controversial for political figures because they can be used to keep politically unpopular or even illicit activities from public view.

In popular imagination the offshore system is often seen as a far-flung cluster of palm-shaded islands. The Pandora Papers show that the offshore money machine operates in every corner of the planet including the world’s largest democracies. The key players in the system include elite institutions – multinational banks law firms and accounting practices – headquartered in the U.S. and Europe.

A document in the Pandora Papers shows that banks around the world helped their customers set up at least 3926 offshore companies with the assistance of Alemán Cordero Galindo & Lee a Panamanian law firm led by a former ambassador to the U.S. The document shows that the firm – also known as Alcogal – set up at least 312 companies in the British Virgin Islands for clients of the American financial services giant Morgan Stanley.

A Morgan Stanley spokesperson said: “We do not create offshore companies. . . . This process is independent of the firm and at the discretion and direction of the client.”

The Pandora Papers investigation also highlights how Baker McKenzie the largest law firm in the U.S. helped create the modern offshore system and continues to be a mainstay of this shadow economy.

Baker McKenzie and its global affiliates have used their lobbying and legislation-drafting know-how to shape financial laws around the world. They have also profited from work done for people tied to fraud and corruption reporting by ICIJ has found.

The people that the firm has done work for includes Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky who U.S. authorities allege laundered $5.5 billion through a tangle of shell companies purchasing factories and commercial properties across the U.S. heartland.

Baker McKenzie also did work for Jho Low a now-fugitive financier accused by authorities in multiple countries of masterminding the embezzlement of more than $4.5 billion from a Malaysian economic development fund known as 1MDB. ICIJ’s reporting found that Low relied on Baker McKenzie and its affiliates to help him and his associates build a web of companies in Malaysia and Hong Kong. U.S. authorities allege they used some of those companies to shift money looted from 1MDB.

A spokesperson for Baker McKenzie said the firm seeks to provide the best advice to its clients and strives “to ensure that our clients adhere to both the law and best practice.”

The spokesperson didn’t directly address many questions about Baker McKenzie’s role in the offshore economy citing client confidentiality and legal privilege. But he said the firm performs strict background checks on all potential clients.

‘You know who’

The Pandora Papers investigation is larger and more global than even ICIJ’s landmark Panama Papers investigation which rocked the world in 2016 spawning police raids and new laws in dozens of countries and the fall of prime ministers in Iceland and Pakistan.

The Panama Papers came from the files of a single offshore services provider: the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. The Pandora Papers shine a light on a far wider cross-section of the lawyers and middlemen who are at the heart of the offshore industry.

The Pandora Papers provide more than twice as much information about the ownership of offshore companies. In all the new leak of documents reveals the real owners of more than 29000 offshore companies. The owners come from more than 200 countries and territories with the largest contingents from Russia the U.K. Argentina and China.

The 150 news outlets that joined the investigative partnership include The Washington Post the BBC The Guardian Radio France Oštro Croatia the Indian Express Zimbabwe’s The Standard Morocco’s Le Desk and Ecuador’s Diario El Universo.

A global team was needed because the 14 offshore providers that are the sources of the leaked documents are headquartered around the globe from the Caribbean to the Persian Gulf to the South China Sea.

Three of the providers are owned by former senior government officials: a former government minister and presidential adviser in Panama and a former attorney general of Belize who controls two providers.

For a few hundred or a few thousand dollars offshore providers can help clients set up a company whose real owners remain hidden. Or for perhaps $2000 to $25000 they can set up a trust that in some instances allows its beneficiaries to control their money while embracing the legal fiction that they don’t control it – a bit of paper-shuffling creativity that helps shield assets from creditors law enforcement and ex-spouses.

Offshore operatives don’t work in isolation. They partner with other secrecy providers around the globe to create interlocking layers of companies and trusts. The more complex the arrangements the higher the fees – and the more secrecy and protection clients can expect.

The Pandora Papers show that an English accountant in Switzerland worked with lawyers in the British Virgin Islands to help Jordan’s monarch King Abdullah II secretly purchase 14 luxury homes worth more than $106 million in the U.S. and the U.K. The advisers helped him set up at least 36 shell companies from 1995 to 2017.

In 2017 the king bought a $23 million property overlooking a California surfing beach through a company in the BVI. The king paid extra to have another BVI company owned by his Swiss wealth managers act as the “nominee” director for the BVI company that bought the property.

In the offshore world nominee directors are people or companies paid to front for whoever is really behind a company. Application forms sent to clients by Alcogal the law firm working on the king’s behalf say that the use of nominee directors helps “preserve privacy by avoiding the identity of the ultimate principal . . . being publicly accessible.”

In emails offshore advisers used a code name for the king: “You know who.”

U.K. attorneys for the king said that he is not required to pay taxes under Jordanian law and that he has security and privacy reasons to hold property through offshore companies. They said the king has never misused public funds.

The attorneys also said that most of the companies and properties identified by ICIJ have no connection to the king or no longer exist but declined to provide details.

Experts say that as ruler of one of the Middle East’s poorest and most aid-dependent countries the king has reasons to avoid flaunting his wealth.

“If the Jordanian monarch were to display his wealth more publicly it wouldn’t only antagonize his people it would piss off Western donors who have given him money” Annelle Sheline an expert on political authority in the Middle East told ICIJ.

In neighboring Lebanon where similar questions about wealth and poverty have been playing out the Pandora Papers show top political and financial figures have also embraced offshore havens.

They include the current prime minister Najib Mikati and his predecessor Hassan Diab as well as Riad Salameh the governor of Lebanon’s central bank who is under investigation in France for alleged money laundering.

Marwan Kheireddine Lebanon’s former minister of state and the chairman of Al Mawarid Bank also appears in the secret files. In 2019 he scolded former parliamentary colleagues for inaction amid a dire economic crisis. Half the population was living in poverty struggling to find food as grocers and bakeries closed.

“There is tax evasion and the government needs to address that” Kheireddine said.

That same year the Pandora Papers reveal Kheireddine signed documents as owner of a BVI company that owns a $2 million yacht.

Al Mawarid Bank was one of many in the country that restricted customers’ U.S. dollar withdrawals to stem economic panic.

Wafaa Abou Hamdan a 57-year-old widow is among the regular Lebanese who remain angry at their country’s elites. Because of runaway inflation her life savings plummeted from the equivalent of $60000 to less than $5000 she told Daraj an ICIJ media partner.

“All my life’s efforts went in vain. I have been working continuously for the past three decades” she said. “We are still struggling on a daily basis to maintain our living” while “the politicians and the bankers” have “all transferred and invested their money abroad.”

Kheireddine and Diab did not respond to requests for comment. In a written response Salameh said he declares his assets and has complied with reporting obligations under Lebanese law. Mikati’s son Maher said it is common for people in Lebanon to use offshore companies “due to the easy process of incorporation” rather than a desire to evade taxes.

‘Coalition of the corrupt’

Imran Khan was elated when ICIJ’s Panama Papers investigation came out in April 2016.

“The leaks are God-sent” the Pakistani politician and former cricket superstar said.

The Panama Papers revealed that the children of Pakistan’s prime minister at the time Nawaz Sharif had ties to offshore companies. This gave Khan an opening to hammer Sharif his political rival on what Khan described as the “coalition of the corrupt” ravaging Pakistan.

“It is disgusting the way money is plundered in the developing world from people who are already deprived of basic amenities: health education justice and employment” Khan told ICIJ’s partner The Guardian in 2016. “This money is put into offshore accounts or even western countries western banks. The poor get poorer. Poor countries get poorer and rich countries get richer. Offshore accounts protect these crooks.”

Ultimately Pakistan’s top court removed Sharif from office as a result of an inquiry sparked by the Panama Papers. Khan swept in to replace him in the next national election.

ICIJ’s latest investigation the Pandora Papers brings renewed attention to the use of offshore companies by Pakistani political players. This time the offshore holdings of people close to Khan are being disclosed including his finance minister and a top financial backer.

The documents also show that Khan’s water resources minister Chaudhry Moonis Elahi contacted Asiaciti an Singapore-based offshore services provider in 2016 about setting up a trust to invest the profits from a family land deal that had been financed by what the lender later claimed was an illegal loan. The bank told Pakistani authorities that the loan had been approved due to the influence of Elahi’s father a former deputy prime minister.

Asiaciti records say that Elahi backed off from putting money into a trust in Singapore after the provider told him it would report the details to Pakistani tax authorities.

Elahi did not respond to ICIJ’s requests for comment. Hours before the release of Pandora Papers stories a family spokesman told ICIJ media partners that “misleading interpretations and data have been circulated in files for nefarious reasons.” The spokesman added that the family’s assets “are declared as per applicable law.”

Also today a spokesperson for Khan told a press conference that if any of his ministers or advisors had offshore companies “they will have to be held accountable.”

Other political figures have also spoken out against the offshore system while surrounded by appointees and other supporters who have assets stowed offshore. Some who have spoken out have used the system themselves.

“Every public servant’s assets must be declared publicly so that people can question and ask – what is legitimate?” Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta told the BBC in 2018. “If you can’t explain yourself including myself then I have a case to answer.”

The leaked records listed Kenyatta and his mother as beneficiaries of a secretive foundation in Panama. Other family members including his brother and two sisters own five offshore companies with assets worth more than $30 million the records show.

Kenyatta and his family did not reply to requests for comment.

Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis one of his country’s richest men rose to power promising to crack down on tax evasion and corruption. In 2011 as he became more involved in politics Babis told voters that he wanted to create a country “where entrepreneurs will do business and will be happy to pay taxes.”

The leaked records show that in 2009 Babis injected $22 million into a string of shell companies to buy a sprawling property known as Chateau Bigaud in a hilltop village in Mougins France near Cannes.

Babis has not disclosed the shell companies and the chateau in the asset declarations he’s required to file as a public official according to documents obtained by ICIJ’s Czech partner Investigace.cz. In 2018 a real estate conglomerate indirectly owned by Babis quietly bought the Monaco company that owned the chateau.

Babis didn’t respond to requests for comment.

A spokesman for the conglomerate told ICIJ that it complies with the law. He didn’t respond to questions about the acquisition of the chateau.

“Like any other business entity we have the right to protect our trade secrets” the spokesman wrote.

‘A haven of scams’

The secret files provide a layer of behind-the-curtain context to public pronouncements this year about wealth and offshore refuges — as governments around the world struggle with revenue crunches a pandemic climate change and public distrust.

In February a commentary from the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change urged policymakers to seek among other measures higher taxes on land and homes. Blair the institute’s founder and executive chairman talked about how the rich and well-connected shirk paying their share of taxes as far back as 1994 when he campaigned to become the leader of the U.K.’s Labour Party.

“For those who can employ the right accountants the tax system is a haven of scams perks … and profits” he said during a speech in England’s West Midlands. “We should not make our tax rules a playground for …. tax abusers who pay little or nothing while others pay more than their share.”

The Pandora Papers show that in 2017 Blair and his wife Cherie became the owners of a $8.8 million Victorian building by acquiring the British Virgin Islands company that held the property. The London building now hosts Cherie Blair’s law firm.

The records indicate that Cherie Blair and her husband who served as a diplomat in the Middle East after stepping down as prime minister in 2007 bought the offshore company that owned the building from the family of Bahrain’s industry and tourism minister Zayed bin Rashid al-Zayani.

By purchasing the company shares instead of the building the Blairs benefited from a legal arrangement that saved them from having to pay more than $400000 in property taxes.

The Blairs and the al-Zayanis said they didn’t initially know about each other’s involvement in the deal.

Cherie Blair said that her husband was not involved in the transaction and that its purpose was “bringing the company and the building back into the U.K. tax and regulatory regime.”

She also said that she “did not want to be the owner of a BVI company” and that the “seller for their own purposes only wanted to sell the company.” The company is now closed.

Through their lawyer the al-Zayanis said their companies “have complied with all U.K. laws past and present.”

“These are loopholes that are available to wealthy people but not available to others” Robert Palmer executive director of Tax Justice UK told The Guardian. “Politicians need to fix the tax system so that everyone pays their fair share.”

In June Brazil’s economics minister Paulo Guedes proposed a tax reform package that included a 30% tax on profits earned through offshore entities. Experts estimate that Brazil’s richest people hold almost $200 billion in untaxed funds outside the country.

“You cannot be ashamed of being rich” Guedes said. “You have to be ashamed of not paying taxes.”

After bankers and business leaders objected to tax hikes in the legislation Guedes a millionaire former banker agreed to remove the proposed tax on offshore profits. Negotiations over the legislation are continuing.

The Pandora Papers reveal that Guedes created Dreadnoughts International Group in 2014 in the British Virgin Islands.

In response to questions from an ICIJ partner in Brazil Revista Piauí a spokesperson for Guedes said the minister has disclosed the company to Brazilian authorities. The spokesperson did not answer a question about the removal of the offshore tax from the legislation.

‘Pandora’s box’

In December 2018 the Bahamas enacted legislation requiring companies and certain trusts to declare their real owners to a government registry. The island nation was under pressure from larger countries including the U.S. to do more to block tax dodgers and criminals from the financial system.

Some Bahamian politicians opposed the move. They complained the register would discourage Latin American clients from doing business in the Caribbean. “The winners of these new double standards are the U.S. states of Delaware Alaska and South Dakota” one local attorney said.

Months later a confidential document indicated that the family of the Dominican Republic’s former Vice President Carlos Morales Troncoso had abandoned the Bahamas as a go-to sanctuary for their wealth.

For their new refuge they chose a place 1600 miles away: Sioux Falls South Dakota.

The family set up South Dakota trusts leaked records show to lay away various assets including shares they’d held in a Dominican sugar company. The family did not respond to questions about the assets moved from the Bahamas to South Dakota.

The Pandora Papers provide details about tens of millions of dollars moved from offshore havens in the Caribbean and Europe into South Dakota a sparsely populated American state that has become a major destination for foreign assets.

Over the past decade South Dakota Nevada and more than a dozen other U.S. states have transformed themselves into leaders in the business of peddling financial secrecy. Meanwhile most of the policy and law enforcement efforts of the world’s most powerful nations have stayed focused on “traditional” offshore havens such as the Bahamas the Caymans and other island paradises.

The U.S. is one of the biggest players in the offshore world. It is also the country best situated to bring an end to offshore financial abuses thanks to the outsize role it plays in the international banking system. Because of the U.S. dollar’s status as the de facto global currency most international transactions flow in and out of New York-based banking operations.

U.S. authorities have taken action over the past two decades to force banks in Switzerland and other countries to turn over information about Americans with overseas accounts.

But the U.S. is more interested in forcing other countries to share information about Americans banking offshore than in sharing information about money moving through U.S. bank accounts companies and trusts.

The U.S. has refused to join a 2014 agreement supported by more than 100 jurisdictions including the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg that would require American financial institutions to share information they have about foreigners’ assets.

Year after year in South Dakota state lawmakers have approved legislation drafted by trust industry insiders providing more and more protections and other benefits for trust customers in the U.S. and abroad. Customer assets in South Dakota trusts have more than quadrupled over the past decade to $360 billion.

“As a citizen I’m so sad that my state was the state that opened Pandora’s box” Susan Wismer a former lawmaker told ICIJ.

By 2020 17 of the world’s 20 least-restrictive jurisdictions for trusts were American states according to a study by Israeli academic Adam Hofri-Winogradow. In many cases he said U.S. laws have made it more difficult for creditors to put their hands on what they are owed including child support payments from absent parents.

Using documents from the Pandora Papers ICIJ and The Washington Post identified nearly 30 U.S.-based trusts linked to foreigners personally accused of misconduct or whose companies were accused of wrongdoing.

Among them is Federico Kong Vielman whose family is one of Guatemala’s economic powerhouses.

In 2016 Kong Vielman moved $13.5 million into a trust in Sioux Falls. Some of the money came from his family’s company which makes floor waxes and other products.

Guatemalan media reported for decades on the family’s ties to politics. In the 1970s the family was identified as a key ally of Gen. Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio the former Guatemalan dictator known as the “Jackal of Zacapa.” In 2016 the family’s luxury hotel in Guatemala City made a gift of 100 free nights to then-President Jimmy Morales. Guatemalan media outlets reported that a possible payment for “political favors” was suspected.

In 2014 U.S. labor officials filed a complaint against Guatemala’s government that included allegations that the family’s palm oil company underpaid workers and exposed them to toxic chemicals. Company records show Kong Vielman was previously the company’s treasurer.

A year later U.S. environmental authorities providing technical assistance to Guatemala found that the company released pollutants into the Pasion River. The family company Nacional Agro Industrial SA known as Naisa was not charged.

Naisa told ICIJ that it followed the law and did not pollute the river. The labor complaint was resolved by an arbitration panel the company said.

Kong Vielman declined to respond to questions about the South Dakota trust.

Another wealthy Latin American who set up trusts in South Dakota is Guillermo Lasso a banker who was elected as Ecuador’s president in April. Leaked records show that Lasso moved assets into two trusts in South Dakota in December 2017 three months after Ecuador’s parliament passed a law prohibiting public officials from holding assets in tax havens. The records show that Lasso moved two offshore companies to the South Dakota trusts from two secretive foundations in Panama.

Lasso said that his past use of offshore entities was “legal and legitimate.” Lasso said he complies with Ecuadorian law.

Trusts set up in South Dakota and many other U.S. states remain cloaked in secrecy despite enactment this year of the federal Corporate Transparency Act which makes it harder for owners of certain types of companies to hide their identities.

The law is not expected to apply to trusts popular with non-U.S. citizens. Another glaring exemption financial crime experts say is that many lawyers who set up trusts and shell companies have no obligations to examine the sources of their clients’ wealth.

“Clearly the U.S. is a big big loophole in the world” said Yehuda Shaffer former head of the Israeli financial intelligence unit. “The U.S. is criticizing all the rest of the world but in their own backyard this is a very very serious issue.”

‘Extraordinary expenses’

Billionaire Erman Ilicak’s construction empire had a big year in 2014.

The Turkish mogul’s company Rönesans Holding finished building a 1150-room presidential palace for his country’s pugnacious leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan amid media rumblings about cost overruns and corruption and a court order attempting to stop the project.

Another notable event involving the Ilicak family took place in 2014 this time out of the public glare. The corporate titan’s 74-year-old mother Ayse Ilicak became the owner of two offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands according to the Pandora Papers.

Both companies were fronted by nominee directors and nominee shareholders. One of the companies Covar Trading Ltd. held assets from the family’s construction conglomerate the records say. During its first full year in operation Covar Trading earned $105.5 million in income from dividends according to confidential financial statements. The money was stashed in a Swiss account.

It didn’t stay long.

That same year the statements show the company paid almost the entire $105.5 million as a “donation” listed under “extraordinary expenses.” The statements do not describe who or what received the money.

Illiack did not reply to questions for this story.

Ilicak and the other billionaires in the Pandora Papers come from 45 countries with the largest number from Russia (52) Brazil (15) the U.K. (13) and Israel (10).

The American billionaires mentioned in the secret documents include two tech moguls Robert F. Smith and Robert T. Brockman whose trusts have been the targets of investigations by U.S. authorities. Both were clients of CILTrust an offshore provider in Belize operated by Glenn Godfrey a former attorney general of Belize.

Sign up for a special guided tour of the Pandora Papers investigation delivered straight to your inbox.

Smith agreed last year to pay U.S. authorities $139 million to settle a tax probe and is cooperating with prosecutors. A U.S. grand jury indicted Brockman Smith’s mentor and financial backer in what prosecutors called the biggest tax fraud in U.S. history.

Smith declined to comment. Brockman has pleaded not guilty.

Neither CILTrust nor Godfrey have been accused of wrongdoing. Godfrey did not respond to requests for comment.

A law firm in Cyprus Nicos Chr. Anastasiades and Partners appears in the Pandora Papers as a key offshore go-between for wealthy Russians. The firm retains the name of its founder Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades and the president’s two daughters are partners there.

The records show that in 2015 a compliance manager at the Panama law firm Alcogal found that the Cypriot law firm helped a Russian billionaire and former senator Leonid Lebedev conceal ownership of four companies by listing law firm employees as owners of Lebedev’s entities.

Lebedev – an oil tycoon and movie producer with Hollywood connections – fled Russia in 2016 after authorities accused him of embezzling $220 million from an energy company. Lebedev did not respond to requests for comment. The status of the Russian case is unclear.

The Cypriot law firm also prepared reference letters for Russian steel magnate Alexander Abramov including one drafted days after the U.S. added the billionaire’s name to the list of oligarchs close to President Putin. Abramov didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Theophanis Philippou the law firm’s managing director told the BBC an ICIJ partner that it has never misled authorities or concealed the identity of a company owner. He declined to comment on clients citing attorney-client confidentiality.

Another Russian in the Pandora Papers who has ties to Putin is Konstantin Ernst a television executive and Oscar-nominated producer. He has been called Putin’s top image-maker a creative talent who sold the nation on the idea that the president is “Russia’s strong-willed savior.”

The Pandora Papers reveal that Ernst was given a chance to participate in a lucrative opportunity soon after producing the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics at Sochi creating a spectacle that boosted Putin’s reputation inside and outside the country.

Ernst became a silent partner hidden behind layers of offshore companies in a state-funded privatization contract – a deal to buy dozens of movie theaters and other property from the city of Moscow.

The leaked records show that by 2019 the value of Ernst’s personal stake in the property holdings topped $140 million.

Ernst told ICIJ that he has “never made a secret” of his involvement in the privatization deal and that the deal was not compensation for his work during the 2014 Olympics.

“I haven’t committed any illegal actions” he said. “Nor am I committing any now or about to. This is how my parents raised me.”

‘Our way of life’

As a human rights and anti-poverty activist Mae Buenaventura joined the fight to secure the return of billions of dollars the late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos his family and cronies concealed in Swiss accounts and other hard-to-trace locations.

Many in her home country Buenaventura said “know that the wealthy have ways and means to accumulate riches and also hide them in a way that ordinary people cannot get their hands on.”

The Marcos scandal also educated the world encouraging stepped-up efforts to discover illicit money and punish the people who hide it.

Over the last 20 years political leaders have vowed to “eradicate” tax havens. They’ve called shell companies and money laundering “threats to our security our democracy and our way of life.” They’ve passed new laws and inked international agreements.

But the offshore system is nothing if not adaptable and cross-border financial crime and tax dodging continue to thrive.

When an offshore provider or jurisdiction is exposed by a leak or comes under pressure from authorities others use its misfortune as a marketing opportunity snapping up clients fleeing for safer havens.

An ICIJ analysis identified hundreds of offshore companies that ended relationships with the scandal-tarred law firm Mossack Fonseca after the release of the Panama Papers investigation. Other providers took over as the companies’ offshore agents.

One of those companies was controlled by an offshore trust whose beneficiaries included the wife of Jacob Rees-Mogg a member of the British Conservative Party and current leader of the House of Commons.

The Pandora Papers indicate that a holding company and a trust benefiting his spouse Helena de Chair owned “pictures and paintings” worth $3.5 million.

Another company that moved away from Mossack Fonseca was a BVI entity controlled by the widow and two sons of Indian underworld figure Iqbal Memon. Memon has been identified in news reports as a major drug dealer with links to terrorists. His widow and sons are accused of laundering drug money and have been wanted since 2019 by authorities in New Delhi.

In the Philippines money being moved around in the shadows continues to be a problem despite the attention given to Marcos’ offshore loot. In recent years the U.S. has labeled the Philippines as a “major money laundering jurisdiction.”

Philippine political figures in the Pandora Papers include Juan Andres Donato Bautista. He served from 2010 to 2015 as the chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government – the panel established to track down Marcos’ billions.

A month after he was appointed to lead the commission Bautista created a shell company in the British Virgin Island that held a bank account in Singapore secret records show.

Bautista was later tapped to head the country’s election agency but lawmakers impeached him in 2017 after his wife claimed he’d hoarded millions of dollars in undeclared domestic and foreign accounts.

In a phone call and emails to ICIJ Bautista said he created his BVI company on the advice of bankers. The bank account was opened before he joined the government he said adding that it never received significant deposits and that he disclosed his interests to authorities. He denied wrongdoing and said there are no formal charges against him.

Despite failures by the Philippines and other nations to curb the flow of covert money Buenaventura and other reform advocates say there are reasons for hope.

Street protesters helped topple top leaders in Iceland and Pakistan after the Panama Papers. The Philippines has joined dozens of countries that now require companies to disclose their real owners. Philippine authorities have recovered roughly $4 billion stolen by Marcos and his circle using it to buy land for landless farmers and to compensate families of people targeted for murder or “enforced disappearance” by the Marcos regime.

Many obstacles remain. Big banks law firms and other powerful groups often oppose stronger transparency rules and tougher enforcement against offshore abuses. And in the Philippines and many other countries anti-corruption activists endure legal threats arrests and violence.

Last month police fired water cannons at protesters who marked the 49th anniversary of Marcos’ declaration of martial law by drawing attention to similarities with current President Rodrigo Duterte’s rule.

Buenaventura said she and other grass-roots activists will keep working to expose wealth that’s “deeply hidden.”

“Our slogan is: The truth will come out.”

Call it the new currency of investment. Consciousness about Environment ESG ) factors in running companies has been rising steadily. Growing inequalities need for social justice better disclosure requirements and extreme weather conditions playing out around us have all led to a call for action in more ways than one. It has also catalysed investments into companies that pay special attention to environmental social and governance issues.Simply put analysts study a company’s ‘Environmental Social and Governance’ framework and measure growth opportunities and risks faced by them which are typically not part of regular financial reporting. More and more companies in India today are making ESG disclosures in their annual reports and some are even developing standalone ESG or sustainability reports. These reports showcase the initiatives taken to reduce the carbon footprint water and air pollution and include fair labour practices human rights and ethical business practices.ESG first came to the fore in the United Nations Global Compact report issued in 2005. The report established the need to integrate ESG factors into capital markets to profit both companies and investors. Since then ESG is no longer regarded as a niche concept. As an investor using the ESG criteria can help you determine the future financial performance of a business.The future of our environment has become a priority among communities governments and economies. Issues such as climate change carbon emissions and deforestation have detrimental implications. Hence to tackle these issues there is an urgent need to generate social change political action and financial support. To drive the overall ESG agenda regulators have been nudging companies towards better disclosures and reporting.Typically businesses profit from economic rise higher consumption and globalisation. These factors have always supported and reinforced the role of businesses as providers of products services careers and infrastructure. But in recent times a company’s contribution to critical sustainability concerns such as climate change biodiversity human rights and inclusion have also risen.Synchronously the rise of technology has enabled stakeholders and shareholders to question the manner in which businesses act. All these have brought about a greater need for transparent measurement and disclosure of sustainability performance. For instance through corporate reporting you can identify and measure the company’s performance in the same manner as it uses the ESG report to make the right decisions.ESG strategies are sustainable and have proven they can offer good returns. According to the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing February 2021 Sustainable Funds outperformed their traditional peers. The report also revealed how monies invested in sustainable businesses offer lower market risk.As per Bloomberg data the MSCI India ESG Index has consistently outperformed its benchmark i.e. MSCI India from May 2011 to March 2021. The Nifty 100 ESG Index too has outperformed the Nifty50 and Nifty100 across both one and five-year time frames.Retail investors always have the option to evaluate the ESG initiatives of companies and make direct investments. This could however be time consuming and tedious and therefore should be left to experienced fund managers. They have the necessary expertise and tools to analyse the financial performance and ESG initiatives together to make appropriate investment decisions.Investing in an ESG fund offered by retail money managers or life insurance companies can give you the opportunity to seek good returns and make a positive environmental and social impact. Such funds use ESG principles and invest in companies that are making efforts to protect the environment be equitable and have high standards of governance. Through rigorous research fund managers identify companies with the right ESG values and invest your money in these companies to generate returns.Most money managers today have a clearly articulated ‘Responsible Investing Framework’. Such a framework specifies how they choose to invest in companies that have better ESG practices with a focus on governance which is then monitored through their stewardship policies exclusion principles and external ESG ratings along with internal evaluation.With more asset managers offering ESG funds as an investment option to retail investors companies are being directly impacted. Becoming ESG-compliant not only increases their relevance as an investment option but also enables them to make a positive impact for the betterment of society. With investors progressively gravitating towards investing in ESG-oriented funds they are making a difference in the way corporations function.In fact international investors investing in India-listed entities very closely scrutinise their ESG initiatives and base their investment decisions accordingly. Globally assets under management (AUM) by ESG funds exceed $35 trillion. While the concept of ESG Funds is relatively new in India as of July 2021 the total AUM stood at approximately Rs 115 billion.A vast majority of millennials today are conscious of environmental concerns ensuring social equity and proper governance which is likely to drive their investment decisions. It is a win-win situation as not only does it provide them with returns but also serves as a route for them to positively contribute to the society.Given the millennial activism and spurt in sustainable investing it is time for every generation to consider the ESG investment option. As more and more companies regulate their strategies and establish good corporate social responsibility ESG investing will pave the trail for a sustainable and profitable tomorrow.If you’re an investor that values the principles of ESG it’s time to embrace responsible investing. ESG investing can be an excellent way of complimenting your portfolio with funds that reflect your standards and ethics while providing good returns.(Jitendra Arora is Executive Vice President for Investments at ICICI Prudential Life Insurance.

Now the super-luxury car brand has showcased its latest coachbuilt vehicle the Boat Tail at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este on the Mosaic Lawn within the grounds of the Grand Hotel Villa d'Este on the shores of Lake Como Italy. The car is being exhibited four years after the first coachbuilt Rolls-Royce the Sweptail was launched at the same event in 2017.

The car was unveiled on the Mosaic Lawn by Torsten Muller-Otvos Chief Executive Officer Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.

This is the first time Boat Tail has been displayed in public for two days offering a unique opportunity to examine the car's remarkable coachbuilt construction and extraordinary Bespoke detailing which are designed and hand-built at the Home of Rolls-Royce in a highly demanding technical and creative project lasting almost four years.

The company had previously confirmed that coachbuilding will be a permanent part of the company' future portfolio. Taking inspiration from a sailing boat and a yacht and the original 1932 Rolls-Royce Phantom II Continental Boattail Tourer the new-age Boat Tail is a soft-top convertible that is nearly 5800 mm long featuring the brand's iconic pantheon grille and classic circular lights along with LED DRLs.

At the press of a button the rear deck opens in a sweeping butterfly gesture to reveal an intricate and generous hosting suite

Torsten Muller-Otvos Chief Executive Officer Rolls-Royce Motor Cars said ""It is a wonderful privilege to reveal this unique Rolls-Royce to the world for the very first time. Although images have been widely shared the car itself has not been displayed in public before. The Villa d'Este Concorso d'Eleganza is the perfect occasion bringing together leading international media alongside knowledgeable motoring experts and discerning luxury aficionados on the glamorous shores of Lake Como. There is also a pleasing symmetry in that we launched the first coachbuilt Rolls-Royce of the modern era Sweptail at the 2017 event.""

He further added ""It is a truly historic moment for the marque. We are leading a modern coachbuilding movement that takes the wider luxury industry into an entirely different space where hyper-personalisation and contemporary patronage provide essentially limitless possibilities.""

A Montblanc pen resides in a discretely placed hand-crafted case of aluminium and leather in the car's glove box.

The exterior of Rolls-Royce Boat Tail is treated in a complex dual tone of blue and black with matching multi-spoke alloy wheels. In fact for the first time Rolls-Royce is offering a hand-painted gradated bonnet. The nautical references at the rear become more apparent thanks to the aft deck which incorporates large swathes of wood. The deck opens in a sweeping butterfly gesture at the press of a button to reveal an intricate and generous hosting suite. The cabin comes with a leather interior that matches the bonnet's colour tone with the front seats swathed in the darker blue hue recognising Boat Tail's driver-focused intent while the rear seats are finished in the lighter tone. The car also comes with unique BOVET 1822 timepieces 15-speaker Bespoke Rolls-Royce Audio System signature Rolls-Royce umbrellas and more.",,,,,,,,,,,,

During a welcome and oath-swearing ceremony for nearly 100 new police recruits Commissioner of Police Paul Rolle told the men and women that his executive team was present with the exceptions of two assistant commissioner’s including Assistant Commissioner Zhavargo Dames “who’s representing me in another meeting trying to get some technology additional technology for the Royal Bahamas Police Force”.

When contacted for specifics Rolle told Eyewitness News: “We are doing some exploration with artificial intelligence.”

He did not expound on what area the AI technology could be used in or what it could potentially achieve in its use in The Bahamas.

The use of AI in law enforcement is not uncommon in other jurisdictions with significant advances in recent years.

A Motorola Solutions and research team at Goldsmiths University of London published a report public this week that found an overwhelming majority of people in the United Kingdom wanted to see technology such as data analytics and artificial intelligence used to increase public safety.

More than three quarters of the 12000 citizens surveyed wished to see emergency services use advanced technologies to predict risk and around the same numbers believe technologies such as video cameras data analytics cybersecurity and the cloud are needed to address challenges in the modern world.

In The Bahamas with cybercrime including hacking extortion computer misuse and threats increasing 33 percent in the year ending 2020 compared to the year prior and a consistent number of complaints against police from members of the public (149 matters in 2020 compared to 152 in 2019) law enforcement officials turned to new technology such as body-worn cameras and dash-cams as part of the organization’s innovation to increase public safety and fight crime.

The RBPF has seen numerous technology innovations in recent years.

These included a $17 million unmanned drone program which is still en-train; a $2 million long-range coastal radar system; a $3 million expansion of closed-circuit television; a $1.9 million ShotSpotter program; and nearly $1 million worth of body-worn cameras and dash cameras; among others.

In Australia a trial is expected to begin using AI to determine the future risk posed by known domestic violence perpetrators according to a September 16 publication in ‘The Conversation’.

In Bengaluru a pilot project introducing artificial intelligence on the police force’s closed-circuit television network of 75000 cameras in the capital is expected to facilitate face-recognition technology and machine-learning-based video monitoring.

In the United Kingdom police officers use algorithms such as facial-recognition tools to carry out law enforcement comparing live camera feeds against a pre-determined watchlist.

The program has not been introduced without criticism.

In the 2021 policing plan the commissioner noted that the Financial Crime Investigations Branch will use “cutting edge investigative tools and procedures” to disrupt the increased prevalence of financial crimes.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Large-cap bias explains the popularity of funds linked to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and comparable benchmarks.

However that bias isn’t paying off this year. Due to China’s regulatory crackdown that’s ensnared mostly large-cap companies the MSCI Emerging Markets Index closed the third quarter with a 3.3% year-to-date loss.

That dour showing may prompt investors to assume that emerging markets small-caps are performing even worse than large-cap counterparts. Actually the opposite is true. Just look at the WisdomTree Emerging Markets SmallCap Dividend Fund (NYSEArca: DGS) which is higher by more than 15% year-to-date as of Friday. Investors may be missing out on this opportunity.

“Investors can be forgiven for not realizing how well the asset class has done” says WisdomTree asset allocation director Joseph Tenaglia. “There is currently $750 billion invested in U.S.-listed EM mutual funds and ETFs. Of those assets less than 2% of all EM fund assets are in dedicated small-cap funds.”

As its name implies DGS is a dividend exchange traded fund and it delivers the goods on that front. The WisdomTree ETF yields 3.77% compared to 0.83% to the domestic-focused Russell 2000 Index and nearly 200 basis points above the yield on the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. DGS offers other benefits.

“As opposed to small-cap stocks in the developed world EM small-cap dividend payers have historically been less volatile than their large-cap peers (DGS beta since inception vs. MSCI EM Index: 0.94)” adds Tenaglia. “Lastly EM small caps are showing in today’s environment exactly how great of a diversifier they can be alongside large-cap EM companies.”

The $2.26 billion DGS which turns 14 years old later this month debunks another myth associated with emerging markets stocks: that China dominates the small-cap space.

It’s a reasonable assumption given China’s status as the world’s second-largest economy. As is seen in the U.S. and China the larger an economy and equity market the more vibrant a small-cap realm can be.

However Chinese stocks account for just 13.44% of DGS’s roster placing the country third well behind Taiwan and South Korea — a pair of high quality tech-heavy markets with big dividend growth potential. In other words at a time when investors are looking to generate equity income and limit risk in China while remaining engaged with emerging markets stocks DGS is an ideal ETF to consider.

However the global video game industry is almost a $200 billion market surpassing traditional entertainment venues like movies and music.

In this clip from Backstage Pass recorded on Sept. 13 the Motley Fool's Sanmeet Deo Clay Bruning and Jon Quast give investors an overview of this important industry including the fastest growing segment of the market.

10 stocks we like better than DraftKings Inc.

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.*

They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now… and DraftKings Inc. wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.

See the 10 stocks

*Stock Advisor returns as of September 17 2021

Sanmeet Deo: The total global games market how are these video games played? It breaks down essentially between mobile PC and consoles. Mobile is the fastest and biggest growing segment of the industry your tablet game your smartphone games and it comprises almost 52% of that projected about a $180 billion of gaming revenue for 2021. This is according to Newzoo. PCs are about $36 billion 20% and then consoles are about 28% things like Xbox and PlayStation and all those other things.

Mobile is really where the fastest growing segment of the business is and it makes a lot of sense. Our phones are essentially a gaming device right in our hands and I think I was joking about it with Clay is that I don't know if this is also included in those mobile gamings but I did a fantasy DraftKings game this weekend just for fun yesterday actually and just did a fantasy lineup and participated in that. I wanted to try it out and just see how it was going. That was kind of fun. I won like $10. That was cool. That too it's almost like you can imagine different areas being gamified essentially.

Clay Bruning: Yeah I think it's another thing to consider there is within that not just on sports betting but gambling as a whole you also have this whole segment it's called simulated gaming. But it's the same as gambling except instead of trying to actually win money for example you put in $50 you know that $50 can't win you anything else but you're playing because you enjoy playing the game and having that adrenaline rush without having real money on the line. That'll be interesting to see if there's more expansion in terms of simulated gaming whether it's with these gambling companies or some of these gaming companies that we'll talk about in a little bit as well.

Deo: Yeah and then like what Jon was asking about earlier video game is bigger than just the direct revenues that we talked about. Accenture estimates that direct and indirect video game revenues will reach almost $300 billion.

Now indirect revenues are things such as gaming video content Esports accessories hardware mobile devices. Also like anything that's periphery to just gaming and gaming itself for example the chips that go into basically everything that runs these PCs and the mobiles and these devices that too can be an indirect revenue beneficiaries. Indirect revenue is essentially anything that benefits from this core direct revenue of gaming.

That's a bit of a quick overview on the industry itself and just a couple of quick notes too about the industry that I had come across. You know in 2020 the US video game industry grew about 27% to almost $57 billion in revenue which was surpassing movies and music combined which was according to NPD Group. It's a large business that is growing that's expanding that's almost encompassing more than just the traditional mode of gaming and what gaming is. I feel like there's going to be a blur of what's gaming and what's not gaming especially when we started delving into that metaverse realm.

That's overview of the industry. I don't know if you guys have any thoughts on the industry based on what you guys have researched before what you've seen from your experience?

Jon Quast: Well I'll just say real fast it's so tempting and I'm not a gamer anymore personally but for me as an outsider it's so tempting to just think of your Nintendo consoles your PlayStation consoles your Xbox consoles as what we're talking about with gaming but in reality and I think it was up there and one of those slides the disproportionate size of the mobile gaming industry is on your smartphone. The size of that compared to traditional consoles mobile gaming is a very big part of what we're talking about.

This article first appeared on Simply Wall St News.

InMode (NASDAQ: INMD) is having a breakthrough year. After a parabolic run-up the market is starting to question its valuation. Yet the company continues innovating and delivering value without even using any debt.

See our latest analysis for InMode.

Following a big run-up InMode opted for a 2:1 share split. Although not a necessity in the times of fractional share ownership share splits are still seen as bullish signs. Upon the announcement shares jumped 2% in the premarket.

Meanwhile the company launched EvolveX – a body contouring system. Chief Medical Officer Spero Theodorou called it a revolutionary system for non-invasive body contouring praising the ability to adjust the procedures for individual patients in real-time. InMode is succeeding because it struck the gold on the middle ground. Finding the demographic that wants results that look comparable to plastic surgery but without the full surgical procedure.

According to Grand View Research the non-invasive aesthetic treatment market is expected to grow at a 13.9% compound annual growth rate from 2021 to 2028.

Examining the Profitability

ROE or return on equity is a valuable tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it receives from its shareholders. In other words it is a profitability ratio that measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.

How Is ROE Calculated?

The formula for ROE is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So based on the above formula the ROE for InMode is:

39% = US$128m ÷ US$331m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2021).

The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity the company generated $0.39 in profit.

What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?

Thus far we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"" we can evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits.

Assuming everything else remains unchanged the higher the ROE and profit retention the higher the company's growth rate compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.

InMode's Earnings Growth And 39% ROE

To begin with InMode has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 11% also doesn't go unnoticed.

So the substantial 55% net income growth seen by InMode over the past five years isn't overly surprising.

We then compared InMode's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher than the industry which has a growth rate of 14% in the same period.

Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings is priced in whichever the case may be. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about InMode's valuation check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio as compared to its industry.

Is InMode Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?

InMode doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.

Conclusion

InMode currently has many traits of a high-quality business:

High growth

High margins

Pristine balance sheet

High Insider ownership

In particular it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business along with a high rate of return.

Although no company can dominate the market forever as competitors eventually pressure the margins down InMode has patents and a highly competent management team to keep the pole position in this market.

So it's no surprise the stock has been a major winner too crushing the S&P 500's performance over the past five years

But investors who are still on the sidelines have nothing to worry about. Thanks to its steady momentum and some key advantages this leading apparel stock still has lots of room to run. Read on to find out why Lululemon still makes a solid investment today.

Strong momentum

During the fiscal second quarter Lululemon's revenue grew 61% year over year to $1.45 billion and operating income jumped 134% to $291 million. The business was adversely affected in 2020 by temporary store closures due to the coronavirus pandemic. But Lululemon has since recovered as consumers seek out comfortable and stylish clothing to wear not just at home but as they return to the office as well.

Lululemon's original target market was women. However its men's business is booming registering annualized revenue growth of 31% over the past two years outpacing the women's category during that period. And as part of its international expansion Lululemon plans to open 35 to 40 new stores this fiscal year and this push remains a huge focus for management. For all of fiscal 2020 just 14% of revenue came from outside North America.

""This year we will likely achieve the goal we set to double our men's business and we remain on track to quadruple our international business by 2023 if not sooner"" CEO Calvin McDonald said on the second-quarter earnings call. Since it can tap into new customer groups and new geographies it's clear Lululemon's growth is far from over. Plus the $500 million purchase of Mirror last year gives the company access to the burgeoning at-home fitness market.

Management raised its full-year fiscal 2021 guidance which now calls for sales and earnings to hit $6.23 billion and $7.21 per share at the midpoints of their respective ranges. The market was very pleased with the second-quarter results as shares popped more than 10% following the report. The business has a lot going for it so it's not out of the question that Lululemon continues surprising the market which will only propel the stock higher.

Distinct advantages

Lululemon's remarkable success can be attributed to two main factors.

First the company sells its merchandise primarily on its own website or through its global footprint of 534 stores. Direct-to-consumer (e-commerce) revenue represented 41% of total sales in the most recent quarter down from 61% in the year-ago period. This distribution strategy allows Lululemon to avoid costly markdowns further supporting the strength of the brand with consumers. It's also why Lululemon has consistently produced a higher gross margin than bigger rivals like Nike.

And when it comes to marketing Lululemon doesn't pursue expensive endorsement deals with superstar athletes. Instead it focuses on something called community-based marketing.

The company recruits ambassadors usually fitness or yoga instructors from communities where its stores are located. These ambassadors gain access to new product releases and help create valuable word-of-mouth advertising using a bottom-up localized approach. It's clearly working wonders as evidenced by the fact Lululemon has some of the highest sales-per-square-foot numbers in the retail industry.

If you're worried that you might be late to the Lululemon party think again. This fast-growing consumer brand is shaking things up in the crowded apparel market by doing things its own way. Buying the stock now could be a very smart move.

SEOUL South Korea -- In just nine episodes ""Squid Game"" a survival drama has won over Netflix viewers worldwide.

The Netflix Korea original drama series premiered on Sept. 17 2021 and topped Netflix's drama charts in all 83 countries Netflix provides its streaming services.

Ted Sarandos co-CEO of Netflix said Monday during Code 2021 an annual technology conference hosted in California that ""Squid Game"" is on track to become the biggest show in Netflix's history in any language.

A scene from ""Honeycomb Cookie"" Game in ""Squid Game."" Oct 2021. The irony of grown-up adults risking their lives to win money to repay their debts by playing kids' games has attracted global viewers. Netflix

""Squid Game""'s premise is that of a classic survival death game except each game is based on Korean children's games. Over 400 individuals revealed to be in enormous debt are invited to participate in a mysterious game where they are forced to risk their lives in a series of survival-of-the-fittest rounds for the opportunity to win a $38.5 million prize.

The premise has been compared to those of popular movies including ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Battle Royale.""

""I've watched other survival death game genre movies but there is something more about Squid Game"" 27-year-old content creator Gaga who binge-watched the show told ABC News. ""There are surrounding connections between the characters which makes it even more intriguing"" Gaga added.

Dong-hyuk Hwang director and writer of ""Squid Game"" revealed at the online roundtable interview hosted by Netflix Korea on Tuesday that the secret to ""Squid Game"" is its ""simplicity.""

""Viewers can focus more on the complexities of the characters and be fully immersed in the story when the rules of the games are simple"" Hwang said. ""People are attracted to the chilling irony of grown-up adults risking their lives to win money to repay their debts by playing kids' games.""

A scene from the ""Red Light Green Light"" game in ""Squid Game."" Oct 2021. The director of ""Squid Game"" says that the secret to ""Squid Game"" lies in its 'simplicity.' Netflix

Meanwhile experts surmise that part of the show's surge in popularity comes from adopting particular elements of Korean culture to make a marked and critical statement about society.

""'Squid Game' succeeded in balancing out the intricacies of cultural differences against global issues"" Duk-hyun Jung a Korean cultural critic told ABC News. ""Though the specific Korean childhood games presented in the story may be unfamiliar to global viewers the series managed to present the universal issues of capitalism and an ever-competitive society in a way that's easy to understand."" Jung also added that ""Squid Game's"" success follows that of the immensely popular South Korean movie ""Parasite"" which won the best picture Academy Award in 2020. That film also made significant social commentary on similar issues surrounding capitalism and how it impacts society at all levels Jung said.

Hwang said that he first developed the story for ""Squid Game"" 14 years ago in 2008. He said the plot of ""Squid Game"" was harshly criticized by people then for twisting the nostalgia of Korean childhood games into vehicles of survival-death scenarios adding that the theme now is being praised as ""realistic.""

A scene where participants and operators of Squid Game are looking up at the prize. Oct 2021. 456 individuals in enormous debt are invited to participate in a mysterious children's game where they are forced to risk their lives to win a $38.5 million prize. Netflix

Hwang said he fully understands Netflix's part in the show's success. ""A great advantage is that 'Squid Game' was released simultaneously for all audiences around the world. That's why it was possible to get such an unimaginable response in a single week. It was a great decision to work with Netflix"" Hwang said.

Netflix launched its streaming service in Korea in 2016 and so far has generated 5.6 trillion won ($4.7B USD) and has created 16000 jobs in the nation according to a September 2021 report by Deloitte.

""These (original intellectual property content) have all led to increased sales and employment in linked industries in line with the globalization of the Korean Wave"" a Netflix Korea spokesperson told ABC News.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGxpbmdzdG9uZS5jb20vdHYtbW92aWVzL3R2LW1vdmllLW5ld3Mvc2VpbmZlbGQtbmV0ZmxpeC1hc3BlY3QtcmF0aW8tMTIzNjExMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Seinfeld' Fans Upset That Netflix's Aspect Ratio Cuts Out Jokes Literally,"Seinfeld finally arrived on Netflix Friday and while all 180 episodes are now available on the streaming service some jokes didn’t make the cut literally.

As noted on social media some of the visual gags from the series have been cropped out due to the series’ now-16:9 aspect ratio that updates the picture for HD televisions as opposed to its original and boxier 4:3 ratio from when the series first broadcast on TV.

The cropping is most visible in the episode “The Pothole” where instead of searching for his keys in the now-paved street George Costanza is instead seen lashing out at an otherwise unblemished pavement.

As Slate notes Jerry Seinfeld’s iconic sneaker collection was also sacrificed in many episodes due to the cropping which often just removes the lower portion of the screen.

Trending 'Word Salad': Andrew Huberman's Cannabis Claims Slammed by Experts Brian Wilson Placed in Conservatorship as Daughters Win Consultation Rights Hear the Journey Tune Steve Perry Rerecorded With Steve Lukather's Son Meet the Voice Behind Randy Travis's New Song

A similar situation occurred when Disney+ assumed the streaming rights to The Simpsons where many visual jokes were the victim to the hi-def cropping; however six months later Disney+ restored the episodes to their proper 4:3 ratio. It’s unclear whether Netflix also plans to reinstate the original aspect ratio for Seinfeld.

In other Seinfeld news Netflix promoted their huge acquisition with a new ad that drops Jerry Seinfeld in a Lego set based on his apartment on the show; Bryan Cranston also appears in the ad reprising his Seinfeld role of Tim Whatley:

“Seinfeld “ – Netflix Day!

All 180 episodes available everywhere.

Seinfeld also appeared on the Tonight Show Friday where he and host Jimmy Fallon similarly turned into Lego people for the interview:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlld2lyZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvZ2VuZXJhbC9zZWluZmVsZC1uZXRmbGl4LWFzcGVjdC1yYXRpby1wb3Rob2xlLWNyb3BwZWQtMTIzNDY2ODkzNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Seinfeld' Netflix Aspect Ratio Ticks Off Fans: Titular Pothole Cropped from Beloved Episode,"Another day another aspect ratio iring dogged fans of a beloved TV series. (That’s how the saying goes right?) As was the case when “The Simpsons” got the cropped treatment when it dropped on Disney+ the arrival of every episode of “Seinfeld” on Netflix is not without some rankles. A “Seinfeld” viewer on Twitter noted that one of the series’ crucial visual gags — namely the titular pothole in the Season 8 episode “The Pothole” — has gotten the short shrift due to Netflix’s 16:9 remastering of the iconic ’90s comedy series. Specifically that pothole (in which George Constanza believes his lost keys lie) is entirely cut out of the scene. Check it out below.

As legacy series make their transition to streaming platforms the aspect ratio of it all continues to be an issue for viewers. When “The Simpsons” plopped on Disney+ back in November 2019 the cropping to fit standard-sized televisions obscured some of the show’s best visual jokes.

The pothole is obviously well crucial in the “Seinfeld” episode “The Pothole” which is one of the series’ most appreciated episodes. It also features “Sex and the City” star Kristin Davis as Jerry’s girlfriend du jour whose toothbrush falls in the toilet and leaves Jerry in a serious pickle as to whether to ever kiss her again.

Jerry Seinfeld recently spoke to Deadline about how he may in hindsight like to fix some aspects of the NBC sitcom which ran for nine seasons from 1989 through 1998 on NBC.

“There’s a number of them that I would love to have a crack at but I don’t really believe philosophically in changing or even thinking about the past” he said. “My philosophy of life is that [it] happened the way it happened and we’re going to go from here. And that’s the best way to […] live.”

He added “I think regret is a philosophical position that I disagree with. It kind of assumes you could have changed the past so I wouldn’t even think of that. But if you forced me or you gave me a time machine yeah there’s a few — I would fix some things.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9pc3JhZWwtbmV3cy9jdWx0dXJlL25ldGZsaXgtdG8tYnJvYWRjYXN0LXNob3ctYWJvdXQtaXNyYWVsaS10ZWVuLWtpbGxlci02ODA5NDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix to broadcast show about Israeli teen killer,"Netflix has just purchased a true-crime documentary series created by Yes Docu The Motive. The series which is scheduled to begin streaming on Netflix on October 28 tells the grisly and baffling story of a 14-year-old boy who murdered his parents and two sisters with his father’s rifle in the Ein Kerem neighborhood of Jerusalem in 1986. The boy said a green creature entered his mind and told him to kill his family.

Tali Shemesh and Asaf Sudri who made the award-winning documentary Death in the Terminal created the four-part series.

The boy now an adult has never been identified in the media because he was a minor when he committed the crimes. Many psychiatrists from Israel and around the world tried to understand the motive for his horrific crime but no one reached a clear conclusion. The series creators interviewed Yossi Arnon the murderer’s lawyer who presents his version for the first time and admits that the boy made up the story about a green creature. There are also interviews with police judges doctors prosecutors counselors at the home for young offenders where he served six years and a journalist.

Following the broadcast of the series in Israel in December it was revealed that the killer is now married has children and works in finance in a senior position although Ynet reported that after the killer’s name circulated on social media he was fired from his job.

It is just the mysterious and gruesome kind of crime story that should draw a huge worldwide audience on Netflix."

The new Miami pad is 968 sqm compared to the 1207 sqm mansion in Los Angeles meaning the Hollywood couple has reduced their living space from nine bedrooms to six and 11 bathrooms to nine.

In addition their LA home was on an expansive 3600 sqm lot compared to the 1500 sqm one they now call home according to Realtor.com listings.

But the pop singer and “Game of Thrones” alum’s new Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired pad has its advantages — including nearly 30m of its own private beachfront.

The Miami mansion also features indoor gardens a koi pond 10m-high ceilings Calacatta marble baths a gym a sauna a steam room a spa two kitchens wine cellar bar and 3m-deep pool.

The Bay Point home was formerly owned by Cuban-American musician Willy Chirino.

OPINION:

Two or three years ago Australia's legacy pay TV network Foxtel looked as if it was on the path to obsolescence.

The traditional pay TV subscription model – locking subscribers into long-term contracts and delivering content via satellite or set top boxes – was becoming hopelessly out of date as low cost pay as you go internet steaming services like Netflix launched in Australia.

The subscription model still looks like a dinosaur but Foxtel is in the midst of a remarkable turnaround as it prepares for a sharemarket listing next year.

The company has transformed itself from the one product – Foxtel pay TV – of three or four years ago to a streaming company with several different offerings for viewers: Binge for TV shows and movies; Foxtel Now for premium TV and movies; Kayo for sports; and Flash for live news.

Foxtel has also set itself ambitious targets for the next three years including creating a subscriber base of five million and A$3 billion in annual revenue.

When we look at the current numbers it becomes apparent that Foxtel has set itself a high bar. It currently has fewer than four million subscribers and earns A$2 billion in revenue.

An extra A$1 billion in revenue equates to a rise of 50 per cent; achieving this would be quite remarkable.

Importantly for Foxtel's owners Rupert Murdoch's News Corp and Australian telco Telstra growth of that magnitude would have investors rethinking their attitude to the company perceiving it as a growth business rather than a legacy enterprise.

This is important because investors will pay more for a company – a higher multiple of its earnings – that they believe is growing than for one they believe is static.

Foxtel is busy talking up its prospects. At a strategy day for analysts and potential investors last week the company tried to position itself as a ""disruptor"".

""Our strategy briefing highlights today's Foxtel Group is a very different company to the one-product Foxtel of three or four years ago"" chief executive Patrick Delany said.

""The business has been repositioned as a technology-led streaming company with multiple sources of revenue growth from streaming a strengthened Foxtel Retail offering and growth in digital advertising.""

Delaney might like to position Foxtel as a technology-led streaming company but the reality is it still has a sizeable rump of traditional Foxtel subscribers connecting via set top boxes or satellites.

Nearly half – 1.9 million – of its subscribers are still on the traditional service with streaming making up the rest.

The big question facing Foxtel – and potential buyers in any share market float – is the extent to which it can manage the decline of the older service model and the extent to which it can make up for this decline with new subscriptions to lower-priced streaming services.

Now that it is streaming sport including the major drawcards of rugby league and Australian rules football the attractiveness of Foxtel's traditional service has declined.

Certainly it's hard to see why consumers will remain locked into an expensive service when they can pick and choose from cheaper streaming services they can quit at any time.

That's why New Corp and Telstra are holding off on the float most likely until some time next year.

They know investors will want to see sufficient subscriber growth in its new services to demonstrate the growth is sustainable. That will likely take at least two quarters.

Even with the risks there is considerable upside potential.

Foxtel has been stuck on a market share of about 30 per cent of the population for the past two decades. This is partly due to cost and partly because of its technology.

But delivery of content via the internet has hugely expanded its potential market and it has a lot of catching up to do.

According to a recent study Netflix has more than six million subscribers Amazon Prime 2.9 million and Disney 2.6 million. Foxtel's products by contrast have far fewer: Kayo Sports with 1.1 million subscribers and Binge with 827000 are its top performers.

A big advantage to the streaming services is that people don't limit themselves to just one. Starting at just A$6 per month for Amazon Prime they cost a lot less than the A$59 per month Foxtel charges even if consumers up take two or three.

And while viewers can cancel at any time the reality is that most don't.

The other big advantage for Foxtel in streaming is there are no hardware costs. Its traditional pay TV offerings came with a heavy capital expense associated with satellite installations and set top boxes. Content streaming requires nothing more than an app or a website from the streamer and an internet connection for the viewer.

If it does hit its revenue targets there is potential for much more of it to flow through to profit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9uYXRpb25hbC9maWdodGluZy1zcGlyaXQtcGhvdG9zLWFuZC1wb2Vtcy1zYWx1dGUtYXVzc2llLWNvbW11bml0aWVzLXNtYXNoZWQtYnktdGhlLWJsYWNrLXN1bW1lci9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzNiYTA0MGI1YTUxMDc5YzViZDVlNzMyMGVlODhjNzg50gGnAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY29tLmF1L25hdGlvbmFsL2ZpZ2h0aW5nLXNwaXJpdC1waG90b3MtYW5kLXBvZW1zLXNhbHV0ZS1hdXNzaWUtY29tbXVuaXRpZXMtc21hc2hlZC1ieS10aGUtYmxhY2stc3VtbWVyL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvM2JhMDQwYjVhNTEwNzljNWJkNWU3MzIwZWU4OGM3ODk_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Scary .. like a tornado’: Aussie kids’ haunting words,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.news.com.au/national/fighting-spirit-photos-and-poems-salute-aussie-communities-smashed-by-the-black-summer/news-story/3ba040b5a51079c5bd5e7320ee88c789 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9uYXRpb25hbC9maWdodGluZy1zcGlyaXQtcGhvdG9zLWFuZC1wb2Vtcy1zYWx1dGUtYXVzc2llLWNvbW11bml0aWVzLXNtYXNoZWQtYnktdGhlLWJsYWNrLXN1bW1lci9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzNiYTA0MGI1YTUxMDc5YzViZDVlNzMyMGVlODhjNzg50gGnAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY29tLmF1L25hdGlvbmFsL2ZpZ2h0aW5nLXNwaXJpdC1waG90b3MtYW5kLXBvZW1zLXNhbHV0ZS1hdXNzaWUtY29tbXVuaXRpZXMtc21hc2hlZC1ieS10aGUtYmxhY2stc3VtbWVyL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvM2JhMDQwYjVhNTEwNzljNWJkNWU3MzIwZWU4OGM3ODk_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVybWFpbC5jb20uYXUvc3BvcnQvbnJsL25ybC1ncmFuZC1maW5hbC0yMDIxLWNvdWxkLXJpc2luZy1jb3ZpZC1udW1iZXJzLWZvcmNlLXRoZS1tYXRjaC10by1iZS1tb3ZlZC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzcwZWIxYjA3MmUxNzY2OTZkODIxNzY2MGJkY2I3YzYx0gGkAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJpZXJtYWlsLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC9ucmwvbnJsLWdyYW5kLWZpbmFsLTIwMjEtY291bGQtcmlzaW5nLWNvdmlkLW51bWJlcnMtZm9yY2UtdGhlLW1hdGNoLXRvLWJlLW1vdmVkL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvNzBlYjFiMDcyZTE3NjY5NmQ4MjE3NjYwYmRjYjdjNjE_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No lockdown: NRL Grand Final is go for QLD,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/nrl-grand-final-2021-could-rising-covid-numbers-force-the-match-to-be-moved/news-story/70eb1b072e176696d8217660bdcb7c61 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVybWFpbC5jb20uYXUvc3BvcnQvbnJsL25ybC1ncmFuZC1maW5hbC0yMDIxLWNvdWxkLXJpc2luZy1jb3ZpZC1udW1iZXJzLWZvcmNlLXRoZS1tYXRjaC10by1iZS1tb3ZlZC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzcwZWIxYjA3MmUxNzY2OTZkODIxNzY2MGJkY2I3YzYx0gGkAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJpZXJtYWlsLmNvbS5hdS9zcG9ydC9ucmwvbnJsLWdyYW5kLWZpbmFsLTIwMjEtY291bGQtcmlzaW5nLWNvdmlkLW51bWJlcnMtZm9yY2UtdGhlLW1hdGNoLXRvLWJlLW1vdmVkL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvNzBlYjFiMDcyZTE3NjY5NmQ4MjE3NjYwYmRjYjdjNjE_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZXJ0aG5vdy5jb20uYXUvc3BvcnQvd2VpZ2h0bGlmdGluZy90cmFuc2dlbmRlci1hdGhsZXRlLWxhdXJlbC1odWJiYXJkLWNsYWltcy1zcG9ydHN3b21hbi1vZi10aGUteWVhci1ob25vdXItaW4tbmV3LXplYWxhbmQtYWZ0ZXItb2x5bXBpY3Mtc2hvd2luZy1uZy1iODgyMDI2ODkyetIBsQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZXJ0aG5vdy5jb20uYXUvc3BvcnQvd2VpZ2h0bGlmdGluZy90cmFuc2dlbmRlci1hdGhsZXRlLWxhdXJlbC1odWJiYXJkLWNsYWltcy1zcG9ydHN3b21hbi1vZi10aGUteWVhci1ob25vdXItaW4tbmV3LXplYWxhbmQtYWZ0ZXItb2x5bXBpY3Mtc2hvd2luZy1uZy1iODgyMDI2ODkyei5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Transgender athlete Laurel Hubbard claims sportswoman of the year honour in New Zealand after Olympics showing,"Kiwi weightlifter Laurel Hubbard has been named University of Otago sportswoman of the year.

The Dunedin-based uni awarded the 43-year-old the honour earlier this week.

Hubbard who is understood to be the first transgender athlete to win the award in its 113-year history said she was “grateful” for the support shown to her.

“It is not possible for athletes to complete at the Olympic level without the encouragement and aroha of friends family and supporters” she said in a statement to the Otago Daily Times.

“This award belongs to everyone who has been part of my Olympic journey.”

In August the trailblazer said she was looking forward to ""graceful obscurity"" after her stint at the Tokyo Games came to an end.

Competing in the women’s 87+kg category she bowed out having failed to register a result after missing all three of her snatch attempts.

Despite the anti-climactic showing the first transgender woman to compete at the Olympics said she left with memories as rewarding as any medal.

Hubbard had no excuses for her showing saying she enjoyed a perfect preparation.

Anti-trans activists criticised Hubbard and the IOC for her participation but the softly-spoken athlete met all regulations for her inclusion.

Hubbard competed as a man in junior weightlifting events and underwent hormone therapy transitioning at the age of 35.

Hubbard said she understood the debate and thanked the IOC for ""opening the door"" for trans inclusion in elite sport.

""I haven't come here to change the world. I've come here because sport is part of me"" she said.

""I haven't set out to look for special accommodation or treatment or anything else.

""The IOC has tried to put in place regulations that apply to all sports. I suspect over time there will be more refinement ... but it's not my area of expertise.""

Hubbard also the oldest member of the Kiwi team said she was at peace with her performance.

""I'm looking forward to my career as a pub quiz question or a trivial pursuit card"" she joked.

""I've never been involved in sport because I'm interested in publicity or profile.

""If it means that I now begin to descend into graceful obscurity I'm okay with that."""

The Dunedin-based uni awarded the 43-year-old the honour earlier this week.

Hubbard who is understood to be the first transgender athlete to win the award in its 113-year history said she was “grateful” for the support shown to her.

“It is not possible for athletes to complete at the Olympic level without the encouragement and aroha of friends family and supporters” she said in a statement to the Otago Daily Times.

“This award belongs to everyone who has been part of my Olympic journey.”

In August the trailblazer said she was looking forward to ""graceful obscurity"" after her stint at the Tokyo Games came to an end.

Competing in the women’s 87+kg category she bowed out having failed to register a result after missing all three of her snatch attempts.

Despite the anti-climactic showing the first transgender woman to compete at the Olympics said she left with memories as rewarding as any medal.

Hubbard had no excuses for her showing saying she enjoyed a perfect preparation.

Anti-trans activists criticised Hubbard and the IOC for her participation but the softly-spoken athlete met all regulations for her inclusion.

Hubbard competed as a man in junior weightlifting events and underwent hormone therapy transitioning at the age of 35.

Hubbard said she understood the debate and thanked the IOC for ""opening the door"" for trans inclusion in elite sport.

""I haven't come here to change the world. I've come here because sport is part of me"" she said.

""I haven't set out to look for special accommodation or treatment or anything else.

""The IOC has tried to put in place regulations that apply to all sports. I suspect over time there will be more refinement ... but it's not my area of expertise.""

Hubbard also the oldest member of the Kiwi team said she was at peace with her performance.

""I'm looking forward to my career as a pub quiz question or a trivial pursuit card"" she joked.

""I've never been involved in sport because I'm interested in publicity or profile.

""If it means that I now begin to descend into graceful obscurity I'm okay with that."""

Hence the Democratic effort to make the tax credits that wind and solar companies enjoy more generous push utilities to buy more of the electricity they produce and penalise any that do not. The administration believes the boost this would give to wind and solar firms would enable them to supply over half of the country’s electricity by 2030.

Surging shopper demand coupled with shipping container shortages and bottlenecks at ports have already triggered tighter supply of products from cars to shoes.

In particular some of America’s biggest sellers of clothing and shoes cite one catalyst that has compounded the pressure: factory closures in Vietnam stemming from a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak there. That’s led brands from PacSun to Nike to warn about the effects on their supply.

In late September Nike (NKE) cut its full-year sales outlook due to supply chain issues despite its CEO noting strong consumer demand.

Nike makes about three-quarters of its shoes in Southeast Asia with 51% and 24% of manufacturing in Vietnam and Indonesia respectively.

But as the Vietnam government imposed pandemic-related restrictions including a mandatory shutdown of factories for several weeks from July into September Nike said it incurred 10 weeks of lost production.

Even when factories start to reopen which the company expects to happen in phases beginning in October ramping up to full production could take several months Nike’s chief financial officer Matthew Friend said in a recent earnings call. Half of Nike’s clothing factories in Vietnam are currently closed company executives said during that call.

Vietnam accounts for a third of sports brand Under Armour (UA)’s footwear and clothing production. Under Armour (UA)’s CEO Patrik Frisk said during its most recent earnings call in August that it was closely monitoring impact of factory shutdowns there on its supply chain there calling it a “developing situation.”

Ugg Coach and Michael Kors have exposure

Vietnam is a crucial supplier to the US in particular for apparel and footwear.

“It’s a very big partner of the United States. It’s our second largest source of apparel and footwear” said Steve Lamar president and CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association an industry group. China is the largest supplier of clothing and shoes according to the AAFA.

In July Vietnam was caught in the throes of a coronavirus outbreak caused by a suspected new variant of the virus which Vietnam’s health minister said led to a fast spread of new infections in the nation’s industrial zones.

The government subsequently imposed strict lockdowns and temporarily shut factories there until mid-August then extended it into September. Some factories are still closed.

All of this means that production for everything from sneakers and sandals to jeans dresses T-shirts jackets and more is stalled.

In a research note last month BITG analyst Camilo Lyon said athletic footwear brands such as Nike and Adidas are most at risk of having serious supply chain disruptions because “Vietnam has served as a strong manufacturing alternative to China in recent years.”

Other brands that have significant manufacturing exposure to Vietnam he said include Ugg maker Deckers Outdoor (DECK) Columbia Sportswear Coach parent Tapestry (TPR) and Capri Holdings (which owns the Michael Kors brand).

Lyon estimates it may take five to six months for factories in Vietnam to be back up and running normally when the lockdown ends. And whenever they do come back on line he anticipates another issue: staffing.

“Vietnamese factories will also likely have trouble getting workers to come back to work post-lockdown” he said.

Teen retailer PacSun is expecting an impact to the holiday season.

Brieane Olson president of PacSun said in an interview in August with CNNBusiness that about 10% of its goods are sourced from Vietnam.

Olson said the retailer was already dealing with a two-to-four week delay for its back-to-school inventory this year because of the ongoing global supply chain delays.

Now she said new products for the winter and holiday season is likely to also face another four-week delay she said making it a challenge to get new fashions and styles in jeans tops sweaters and sweatshirts into stores in a timely manner.

And there’s an additional effect on the consumer Olson said: Having less product means the retailer will pull back on discounts “because there is no need for it” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcmJhcmRldHJvaXQuY29tL2Nsb3Qtc2FjYWktbmlrZS1sZHdhZmZsZS1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Clot Sacai Nike LDWaffle DH1347-100 DH3114-001 Release Date - SBD,"Aside from the Air Max 1 releases Clot will also be teaming up with Sacai to release a Nike LDWaffle collaboration for the fall season.

to rejuvenate the NIKE european headquarters in the netherlands rich holland has designed a skate landscape that connects all offices and sports facilities of the campus together. the project combines traditional and skateboard architecture to form an original inviting public space. the skate area is freely accessible daily while there’s also on-site skate school training for anyone interested.

a stimulating hybrid skate spot

rich holland (find more here) has designed this hybrid landscape as a public space that incorporates various skateable elements. this makes it feel more like a newly discovered skate spot rather than a traditional skatepark. all elements are based on shapes and objects that have shaped skateboarding over the past decades with the aalto wave serving as the centerpiece.

the area is characterized by its authentic and inviting appearance formed to stimulate skateboarders’ creativity. this new space is essentially built to welcome all audiences and a forward-thinking approach to public spaces which hopefully will lead to many more similar projects.

Members-only



You read Sole Mates week upon week because you appreciate — perhaps love — sneakers but are they in your blood? For Mike Packer shoes are more than a commodity more than hype more than just a piece of footwear because as his last name suggests he was born into one of the longest-running footwear institutions in the world — Packer.

Founded in 1907 by Mike Packer’s grandfather and great uncle the Yonkers-based imprint provided locals with shoes for all the family no matter the occasion. Fast-forward to 2021 and Packer is a New Jersey mainstay known for its far-reaching clientele and authentic collaborations two things that have cemented the company as one of the best in the business for those who truly love sneakers.

But aside from the company who is Mike Packer? In this installment of Sole Mates HYPEBEAST learns more about what it was like to work in a family-run business from the age of seven how the sneaker industry is laced into his DNA and how this has helped him to become the person — and the eponymous company — that’s he’s known as today while he speaks on his love for the Nike Air Trainer 1.

1 of 3 2 of 3 3 of 3

HYPEBEAST: We usually start with asking what got you into shoes. But as Packer was founded in 1907 I assume a passion for footwear runs in your veins?

Mike Packer: That’s literally true. I grew up in the business. It’s in your blood you have an affinity for things and you remember things it’s what brought me almost 20 years ago to open up the store in New Jersey to do what we do now. It’s in my blood… and I find myself lucky for that. It gives you an innate understanding of everything.

What was it like to grow up in a family-run business?

It was the true definition of a family business. I have great and talented people that work for me now but growing up in the business if your last name wasn’t Packer you didn’t work in the confines of that store. I don’t ever remember — until much later in my life — there being a stock person working in the store with my parents other than just family.

There are salespeople who are still in the industry now that probably know more about the inner fightings of my family because it was all out there in a little store. Every salesperson would come into the store with a bag and show their [shoes] so the family business was there for them to see.

My parents’ legendary fights over who’s going to get lunch they remember those!

What are the differences between the Packer of your youth and the Packer you run today?

The formula for the business that we’re in now is the formula of what makes a good shoe putting it down to its simplicity it’s about the game plan of how to put things to market social media and everything getting modern has changed things. But the core way of getting things out there is really the same: quality good design marketing in a way to organically grow things. Yes it was way different to how it is now but [core elements] of the business are the same.

My learning curve growing up those formative years of growing up [in the business] was the ‘80s and early ‘90s and that time paved the way for what we have today. Being in that realm — and I don’t know if kids today realize it but a lot of us who started the “boutique business” like UNDEFEATED or us Concepts anybody in those early stages that’s the era we grew up in. The formative part of the industry can be looked back on and I feel really lucky to have that as the jumping-off point and education for what paved the way for what Packer does today. Packer is at a point now [where we are] what we envisioned to be 20 years ago.

How did you become the caretaker of Packer?

It was only myself and my brother growing up and my parents retired about 18 years ago. It was something where if there was no one else around to take this further the door would have closed the key would have been turned they would retire to Florida and then nothing else. As I said I grew up in the business — as did my brother — but I ended up going to law school and after being in the venture capital world I had this epiphany after going back and forth between Asia — and because it never left my blood I’d always help my father with Nike meetings or adidas or anyone else we fortunately still work with today we have the same original account numbers from back then — I had this feeling but doing it in a different way to the store we had back in Yonkers.

That was a great education to work in the business since I was seven years old. Thankfully [Packer] has continued and grown.

1 of 2 2 of 2

With all of this in mind what really got you into shoes? Was there a specific moment or pair?

The business itself was everything from kid’s school shoes to church shoes men’s working shoes to sneakers to old lady’s shoes it was a full-family store. As it’s also a family business it’s not that we had hours to work that week and we were punching the clock we were there when we had to be there.

Myself and my brother we were the ones that took the sneaker part of it all — I was drawn to the sneakers — there was an innate [love for] design colors that’s what drew me into it. From my earliest memory of canvas PRO-Keds to canvas Chuck Taylors to then the Converse Weapon.

“Things came out things sold. But nothing was — which I now refer to as — that ‘Holy sh*t!’ moment.”

It’s a very hard thing to put your finger on because it was a 360-degree view of everything and it drew me in.

Out of all of the shoes that have come and gone in your life why are you specifically focusing on the Nike Air Trainer 1 for your issue of Sole Mates?

The Trainer 1. It was 1987. In 1988 right around my late teens working in the store thankfully having an affinity for everything. But I remember that block of time where things were kind of stale in the industry to be frank with you.

Things came out things sold. But nothing was — which I now refer to as — that “Holy sh*t!” moment. I distinctly remember that era of time. It was a time when and this was pre-Las Vegas trade shows you only saw things when a big bag of shoes came or it got leaked on Footwear News.

1987 ‘88 ‘89; Nike took what they had and flipped the script on everything. Visible Air Air Max 1 you had something called Performance Leather which is what they put into the Air Force 2 and the Air Revolution Air Ace Air Safari. That whole capsule when it came to market I don’t know if the market was ready for it because that [goes to show] what these were then and what they are now. If you were in the industry and saw that stuff you couldn’t help but say “Holy sh*t.” You couldn’t.

Admittedly I think it was the Air Max 1 and Air Safari that we saw first but the Trainer 1 was… Just opening up that shoe looking at it a few times I don’t know why and I still to this day can just articulate it but I’d never seen something like this before you didn’t know what it was but you knew it was something.

1 of 4 2 of 4 3 of 4 4 of 4

When Nike had Performance Leather it is still to this day the best leather that’s ever been used on any shoes I’ve ever seen in the industry. Before the Trainer 1 it was used on the AF2 and it was just great. The combination of leathers the suedes the colorway the gray with the chlorophyll and white that on top of the fact that when you look at it “I get it I don’t get it I love it.” There was no reason it just looked.

You had to appreciate it for what it was. Having that feeling and then seeing what John McEnroe did with that shoe for no other reason than him wearing it cemented it even further.

I appreciate being part of your series but when you ask me that question it’s probably the easiest answer to a question in the sneaker industry to give because it’s a very honest and pure answer. I could talk about multiple brands but when it comes to the core the Trainer 1 is it. Do I wear the Trainer 1 on the daily? No. I may wear other silhouettes more but when you ask the pure what why how it’s the easiest answer to give.

That’s what this is all about — authenticity. Moving on Tinker Hatfield designed the Trainer 1. Any words to say on this?

Well it was a crosstraining shoe. If you read the articles from back then it was a new category altogether. If you ask me what category I like best from that era it’s that. The Air Trainer 1 to me the Air Trainer 2 I thought it was a letdown but the Trainer 3 “Medicine Ball” would be in that top five. They had so many other crosstraining silhouettes that started with the Air Trainer 1’s DNA.

“Could you wear a pair of Air Force 1s to run in and UltraBOOST to play ball in? Sure you can. But you’ve gotta be idiotic to do it.”

I’ve never asked but I don’t think Tinker ever envisioned a guy like McEnroe wearing this shoe. They had a whole tennis line and he picked up that shoe and wore it and after that Agassi wore it a few times.

It was an all-purpose shoe.

I just don’t think they ever envisioned McEnroe one of their seminal athletes back then to wear it.

About two years ago I was at a Knicks game and I was sitting in the front row for the first time. I looked to my left and McEnroe is sitting right next to me. During Half Time I said “Can I ask you a question?” And you can see he’s like ah man I don’t want to do an autograph. Well I don’t want a picture I don’t want anything I asked him about the Air Trainer 1. We spoke for the whole third quarter about Trainer 1s.

I asked him out of curiosity why he went to that shoe and the stuff that came out of his mouth was amazing he really has a love for it.

1 of 2 2 of 2

As we’ve established the Air Trainer 1 was a shoe that did everything. Fast forward to today do you think there’s a design that’s as close to being as multifunctional as the Air Trainer 1?

I don’t think there’s ever been a shoe like that since. Once Nike created the category other brands started to do crosstraining models and wanted to build up crosstraining businesses. But as an original design — no there’s never been anything like that.

Theoretically could you wear a pair of Air Force 1s to run in and UltraBOOST to play ball in? Sure you can. But you’ve gotta be idiotic to do it. You’re going to hurt yourself.

For the purpose that it served and McEnroe using it alongside other tennis players I think that was the perfect sport for it because of the way it was constructed and the premium materials that it used. It was the perfect storm. Unless I am missing something I don’t see it happening before and maybe someone will make something better. But what the Trainer 1 embodies is what still excites me today — that “Holy sh*t” feeling.

When you do you know it’ll be a winner in the industry.

So nothing has come that close for you?

Nope.

But has something made you say “Holy sh*t!” since?

The Trainer 1 was the first one the one that hasn’t been topped. But when you see new silhouettes that have come out even back then the Air Safari spoke to me but not like that. The AM1 spoke to me like that Air Force 2 low-tops — which not a lot of people have an affinity for — and when you go to other brands there’s a whole bunch over the years.

In an era where we have so much thrown at us the thing that excites me the most is when you see a performance silhouette come out that speaks to you has some type of DNA and you can say to yourself that it’s wearable now and in 10 years.

When I saw the UltraBOOST 1.0 for the first time you had that same “Holy sh*t” feeling. But all of the shoes we are mentioning people that understand it and see it have that feeling but the greater public didn’t take on these shoes [for a few years]. It had to grow on them or like the UB 1.0 adidas had that magic moment with Kanye. That gave it the push and you could argue McEnroe gave that push to the Trainer 1.

What do you think of the current sneaker industry and the culture today?

From a business perspective it’s thankfully never been better.

[Talking about authenticity and purity] these young kids today would probably look at us and think “Ah you’re too old you don’t know what’s really it.” I’d argue that it’s the total opposite: at least back then at least by having an affinity for things that came out you did it because it was something that was inside you. With the growth of everything I wouldn’t trade it for the world but having the ability to balance that part of the business and stay quality pure organic it’s a hard thing to do.

Is it possible to put the genie back in the bottle and have customers who come in for sneakers because they have a love for things not because someone is telling them to or because a celebrity is wearing it? I hope so.

In the construct of what Packer is today I’m very blessed to have people who have that mindset of staying in our lane while being able to balance what is good and being able to get that out there. I am very proud of our products over the years.

But — if the Trainer 1 came out today — I don’t think it’d have the longevity that it has today because it’d get lost in the sauce.

But what about the rumored Travis Scott pair?

It’s going to be very interesting to me. The pictures have leaked: is a Travis Scott x Nike Air Trainer 1 coming out?

1 of 6 2 of 6 3 of 6 4 of 6 5 of 6 6 of 6

Is it going to be like the rest of the sneakers he touches?

Listen. Some have had a larger trajectory than others. The thing I appreciate most is I believe Travis or Chase B — Chase knows shoes. I don’t think they would touch something that they innately don’t like there’s no reason for Travis to be wearing the Nike Mac Attacks a couple of years ago I don’t know if Nike will ever bring that shoe back. You have to balance business with buzz at some point.

How is Packer going to continue to evolve with the industry?

When you’ve been in this as long as I have… you can’t be something you’re not. One thing that sticks in my head and I’m lucky to have continued it is that we’re an institution in this business. It’s not ego but [I should] embrace that and I feel lucky. But there’s also pressure in that — a good pressure that drives what we do — because being an institution means something greater than what we are.

We’re conduits to take our vision and creative but without these companies what do you really have? I’ve been very [aware] of that. If you keep this in mind striving to be better we change with the times.

Keeping true to what we do to the best of our ability whether it’s with a company like Nike or every other company we’ve been lucky to work with that’s what we put our hearts minds and souls into literally every day. It’s not just me it’s everybody who’s helped and that’s something I’m extremely proud of."

This article examines recent employment declines in rail transportation a small but important component of the transportation and warehousing industry. Although employment in rail transportation remained relatively stable for most of the past 25 years it declined by 40000 jobs from November 2018 to December 2020. This article provides an analysis of the recent employment declines in the rail transportation industry.

After remaining stable for over two decades employment in the rail transportation industry began to decrease in November 2018 according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey.1 By December 2020 the industry had lost 40000 jobs. (See chart 1.) Many sources including both the public media and rail industry experts attributed the beginning of the industry’s employment losses to three main factors: the decline of the reliance on coal as a natural resource an uncertain trade environment and a new method of operations adopted by railroads called Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR). In addition a fourth factor the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic further exacerbated job losses in the industry.

Within the transportation and warehousing industry rail transportation is one of the smallest component industries in terms of employment. In fact rail transportation made up only 3 percent of transportation and warehousing employment as of November 2018 but the industry accounted for 33 percent of the 121000 jobs lost between November 2018 and December 2020. (See table 1 and chart 2.) Employment in rail transportation declined consistently throughout 2019 and into the beginning of 2020 accelerated in April and May of that year and then leveled off through December.

Table 1. Industry composition of transportation and warehousing November 2018 Section Percent Air transportation 8.9 Rail transportation 3.3 Water transportation 1.2 Truck transportation 27.3 Transit and ground passenger transportation 8.9 Pipeline transportation 0.9 Scenic and sightseeing transportation 0.6 Support activities for transportation 13.5 Couriers and messengers 14.1 Warehousing and storage 21.1

The decline of coal

In 2019 U.S. railroads moved 4 million carloads of coal with each carrying enough coal to power 19 homes for an entire year. Five states accounted for approximately 71 percent of U.S. coal production in 2019 despite coal being consumed all over the country.2 However because of recent advances in natural gas extraction and the increased use of renewable resources to generate electricity the United States is becoming less reliant on coal as an energy source.3 In fact the movement of millions of coal carloads in 2019 actually represented a decline of 405000 or 9.2 percent over the year. According to Association of American Railroads (AAR) Vice President John T. Gray the number of coal carloads in 2019 were the lowest they had been in decades.4 With the United States relying less on coal the demand for rail cars that transport coal decreases. In turn there is a decrease in the need for rail cars overall as well as the need for employees to work on the railroads.

In 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic added to the decline in the use of coal as business closures shelter-in-place mandates and generally low demand from the public weakened the overall economy. In addition cheap natural gas prices prompted the increased use of natural gas instead of coal to generate electricity deepening the decline in the number of coal carloads further. As of April 25 2020 when the tightest of COVID-19 restrictions across the United States were still in effect coal was down 21.4 percent over the year.5 As shown in chart 3 the decline accelerated in the beginning of 2020.6 In fact the 2-month period (April and May 2020) in which the largest percentage declines in the number of coal carloads occurred corresponded with the rail industry’s largest over-the-month declines in employment. In addition once the country began to reopen in the summer the number of coal carloads began to increase and rail employment returned to smaller monthly declines. Although coal carloads do not correlate with rail employment on a month-by-month basis it is evident that reductions in coal carloads have a negative influence on rail employment.

An uncertain trade environment

Businesses strive to make efficient use of their time money and other resources and changes in the demand for rail transportation and impacts on their revenues as a result of trade uncertainties can impact the industry’s employment. Rail freight volumes and movement—how often trains are moving freight from one point to another—have recently been reduced by an uncertain trade environment involving the negotiations of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and trade relations between the United States and China. According to AAR economist Luisa Fernandez-Willey trade uncertainty and tariffs had a strong negative effect on the rail transportation industry in 2019 as 42 percent of rail carloads and intermodal units (units using two modes of freight such as truck and rail to transport goods) and 35 percent of annual rail revenue are associated with international trade.7 In addition about 50000 jobs worth over $5.5 billion in annual wages and benefits also depend on international trade.8 The relationship between rail carloads and international trade is strongly tied to employment as fewer carloads and lower revenue tied to international trade mean a reduced need for workers.

Even general uncertainty resulting from the United States’ trade relationships with other countries can lead to the hesitance of firms to hire and thus the USMCA and trade relations with China have been widely referenced in analyzing rail employment declines in 2019. Fernandez-Willey noted that clarity on trade would be vital for the rail industry to recover in 2020 stating that the ratification of the USMCA and the resolution of disputes with China would be the key factors to achieving this clarity.9

In 2019 uncertainty that is due to the ongoing disputes between the United States and China lowered demand for companies that move freight especially within the agriculture and manufacturing industries.10 These disputes included the United States and China imposing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other’s goods. Tensions ran especially high in 2019 with the two countries spending the last few months of the year threatening to impose new tariffs and increase existing tariffs against one another.11 Uncertainty appeared to grow out of the USMCA’s delayed ratification as well with the final outcome of the agreement relatively unclear for most of the year. In December 2019 the U.S. House of Representatives passed the USMCA which established key policy changes.12

In January 2020 it appeared trade uncertainty and its negative effect on rail employment may have started to fade once a phase-one trade deal with China was established and the USMCA was signed into law.13 However the positive outlook for trade and rail employment did not last long into 2020 once the COVID-19 pandemic began. Global trade and shipment volumes were disrupted throughout the year as people across the world stayed at home and quarantined in an effort to contain the virus. The Cass Freight Index for April 2020 released at the height of the U.S. stay-at-home orders is particularly revealing as it reported that shipment volumes dropped 22.7 percent and freight expenditures fell 18.2 percent year-over-year in North America.14 The COVID-19 recession appears to have held back improvements to trade uncertainty as little has changed regarding U.S. trade relations with China since the start of the pandemic.15 Recessions are also typically characterized by a surge in trade disputes and a slowdown in trade negotiations as rising unemployment heightens uncertainty.16

Precision Scheduled Railroading

Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) is a railroad strategy that uses departure schedules and point-to-point delivery methods to achieve low operating ratios (how much a company needs to spend to make a dollar) and consolidate railroad networks (the elimination of shorter less efficient lanes in favor of high-volume lanes).17 PSR may be the most widely accredited reason for the decrease in rail transportation employment. Before PSR was implemented the North American rail model which includes the United States and Canada focused on moving long trains with a single good in order to maximize capacity and yield the greatest efficiency. However this model was actually slowing down the rail network because trains would be late or canceled if they did not meet specific length requirements thus leaving customers unexpectedly without service. With the implementation of PSR the focus shifted to moving cars with mixed goods so that the trains are always moving and cars are picked up on schedule regardless of train length. Despite lower length requirements average train length increased because railroad companies were no longer discouraged from transporting multiple types of goods in a single train. As a result of PSR there is now more efficient timing and scheduling as well as an effective allocation of resources such as crews cars and locomotives in the places where they are needed on the rail network.18

North American railroads are divided by revenue into different classes. Class I railroads are the largest and have an annual operating revenue of at least $447621226 while Class II railroads are known as regional railroads and Class III railroads are known as short-line railroads.19 The practice of furloughing employees is rather common within the rail industry and usually depends on the volume of freight at a given point in time. After Class I railroads adopted PSR furloughs and layoffs in the industry increased. Rail companies including Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific have stated explicitly that they have furloughed or closed down certain operations because of PSR.20 Industry officials seem to hail the new efficiency PSR has brought to the railroads while union leaders have responded negatively because of its effect on employees. One article noted that reduced staffing is made possible by running longer trains as hitching two trains together allows one rail work crew to be cut. This coincides with a 25-percent increase in the average train length (1.4 miles) since 2008. In addition according to rail economist Jim Blaze seven major freight railroads idled nearly 30 percent of locomotives in 2019 alone as they aim to run fewer and longer trains.21

The North American Class I railroads that have adopted PSR as part of their operations include Canadian National Railway Canadian Pacific Railway Limited CSX Corporation Norfolk Southern Corporation Union Pacific Corporation and Kansas City Southern.22 The Surface Transportation Board (STB) regulates North American Class I railroads inside the United States and collects monthly data on employment and occupational composition. These data can be used to show changes in the occupational composition of some of the railroads that have implemented PSR while CES rail transportation employment data are not broken down by the specific type of job in which the workers perform. The STB breaks down the employment data into the following occupational classifications:

Executives officials and staff assistants

Professional and administrative

Maintenance of way and structures

Maintenance of equipment and stores

Transportation (other than train and engine)

Transportation (train and engine)

Thus the STB data show where in terms of types of jobs losses are occurring in the rail industry in a way that CES data do not. Chart 4 displays each of the STB’s occupational classifications and their employment since January 2018 showing little change from January 2018 to November 2018 as well as the changes in trend over the period from November 2018 to December 2020.23

The STB data show that the greatest job losses occurred in the occupational groups most directly involved with the actual operation and maintenance of trains on the railroads. Out of the 31000 jobs lost estimated by the STB transportation (train and engine) accounted for 46 percent of the losses from November 2018 to December 2020 despite representing less than 43 percent of all railroad jobs in November 2018. At the same time maintenance of equipment and stores jobs accounted for more than a quarter of the losses despite being less than a fifth of all employment in November 2018. In contrast the other classifications each contributed between 3 and 15 percent of the job losses over the same period. Although PSR appears to have altered the hiring and layoff decisions of rail establishments over the period employment in rail transportation began to flatten in the second half of 2020 indicating that railroads may have balanced out their employment levels with the new scheduling method.

Coronavirus delivers deeper losses

COVID-19 is discussed earlier in this article because the disease coincided and interacted with the other factors associated with the recent decline of employment in rail transportation. However the COVID-19 pandemic itself can be viewed as a fourth factor contributing to the decline of employment in rail transportation.

A national emergency regarding COVID-19 was declared on March 13 2020 as the virus began to rapidly spread throughout the United States. On March 15 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention discouraged gatherings of 50 or more people over the next 8 weeks prompting many business and school closures in a public health effort to slow the spread of the disease. By March 26 the United States led the world in confirmed coronavirus cases.24 As of April 20 over 316 million Americans in at least 42 states were being urged to stay home.25 COVID-19-related business closures during this period caused millions of Americans to lose their jobs and the rail transportation industry was no exception.26 Employment in rail transportation experienced two large monthly declines during the early months of the pandemic—April and May 2020—for a combined loss of 10000 jobs. This accounts for a quarter of the 40000 rail transportation jobs lost from November 2018 to December 2020 suggesting that the effects of the pandemic had a considerable impact on employment.

Chart 5 displays employment in rail transportation and the number of rail freight carloads over the period from January 2018 to December 2020.27 The two series moved similarly during April and May 2020 at the height of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and business closures. In fact both employment in rail transportation and rail freight carloads experienced notable contractions during those 2 months. However the two series have diverged since May 2020. After declining since January 2020 the number of rail freight carloads began to increase again in May which may be a result of the easing of state restrictions and businesses reopening in some capacity amid the pandemic. Despite the continuing spread of the virus every state had begun to at least partially reopen businesses by the end of May.28 From June to December employment in rail transportation began to level off while the volume of rail freight carloads continued to recover.

In addition news sources also recognized the negative effects of COVID-19 on railroads stating that the shelter-in-place mandates in April and May caused rail volume to be slashed. The COVID-19 pandemic had been predicted to result in a reduction in U.S. imports translating into less volume on the railroads.29 As a result Class I railroads had to deal with reduced demand by temporarily shutting down facilities with less rail traffic.30

In August a FreightWaves article stated that the STB and the Federal Railroad Administration who are responsible for enabling safe reliable and efficient movement of people and goods had asked the Class I railroads to resolve service issues that had arisen during the pandemic as a result of crew availability issues. At the same time labor unions questioned the railroads companies’ furlough practices stating that some recalled furloughed employees were being sidelined for a second time.31 This information suggests that railroads may have hired back workers earlier than they were needed which may explain the deceleration of rail transportation employment losses towards the end of 2020. However the pandemic is not over. New variants of COVID-19 could place further stress on the global economy and could make firms’ decisions regarding employment in the near future more uncertain.32

Summary

Rail transportation employment may be one of the smallest components of transportation and warehousing but recent job losses have been substantial with the industry losing 40000 jobs from November 2018 to December 2020. Rail industry experts and the public media speculate that the three main reasons for the job losses were the United States' decreased reliance on coal as a resource an uncertain trade environment and PSR—a new method of scheduling operations. The COVID-19 pandemic compounded these factors and affected rail transportation employment as a fourth factor. These factors suggest that some of these job losses may be permanent. Although we can acknowledge what led to the large declines in rail transportation employment over this period the future of the industry’s employment remains uncertain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvdGV4YXMtZGVwdXR5LWZpbmRzLWh1bW9yLXdpdGgtYm9ueS1leHByZXNzLXBhc3Nlbmdlci9hcnRpY2xlXzQ3ZjBhZDk0LTExMDgtNTJkYS05ZjE1LWRlMDE0YjJjNjAwNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas deputy finds humor with 'Bony Express' passenger,"Memphis TN (38111)

POTTSTOWN — Yes we said “bridges” so yes there is news here about the Keim Street bridge although it’s tentative.

Thursday night the Pottstown School Board and Pottstown Borough Council held a joint meeting and there were a broad number of initiatives and projects outlined. Today we’re looking at a series of bridge projects presented by Borough Manager Justin Keller.

Always on the tip of everyone’s tongue when the phrase “bridge” and “Pottstown” are mentioned in the same sentence Keller said “everybody loves to talk about the Keim Street bridge and how much of a pain it’s been for the last 12 years or so.”

The bridge was closed in 2010 after it was found to have structural deficiencies.

The good news is the $17 million project “is now fully funded” Keller told both boards. The design work is underway and construction on taking down the old bridge built in 1935 and declared a “historic bridge and replacing it with a new span is scheduled to begin in “late 2022.”

“Although I’ll believe it when I see it” Keller added quietly.

The engineers did look at building the bridge on an angle to align it with Keim Street’s intersection with Industrial Highway but that would have lengthened the span added significantly to the cost he said.

In fact it turned out to be not only too expensive but also more likely to worsen flooding. Although it’s just 100 feet away from the current intersection with Industrial Highway South Keim Street’s location is five or six feet lower than the bridge’s current entrance Daniel Bitterlich a designer from Traffic Planning and Design said during a public unveiling of the plans last year.

However work is planned to widen Industrial Highway between Keim Street and the bridge adding turn-lanes to make it easier for tractor-trailers to navigate the intersections.

As anyone who crossed the bridge before it closed knows it was very narrow only 20 feet wide curb to curb with a five-foot sidewalk on the outside of the northern line of steel trusses.

The new bridge will have two 11-foot driving lanes with two four-foot shoulders as well as a six-foot sidewalk.

King Street Bridge

Getting from or to Route 100 from downtown Pottstown has also been a pain since last year when PennDOT closed the King Street bridge over Manatawny Creek for a full replacement.

The $3.9 million project has a two-year time frame because of the infrastructure embedded in or beneath the bridge — as the water main break in March made clear for those who didn’t already know — and because of wildlife habitat.

“Everyone was shocked when we found out it will take two years” said Keller. “But there are construction restrictions during certain times of the year because of habitat so we can’t work for six months of the year so it took a year-long project and pushed it into two years.”

The good news said Keller is that the project is currently ahead of schedule.

“So there is a very very good chance I can’t promise anything but a very good chance that bridge will be open at least to vehicular traffic in the spring” Keller said. “We’re keeping our fingers crossed.”

When complete the King Street bridge will have a faux finish similar to the High Street bridge over the creek however rather than looking like stone it will look like brick “because it is so close to the historic district” he said.

The wall on the bridge will also be lower with black railings and ornamental light fixtures “similar to those on High Street” he said.

The bridge is being built higher than the current bridge and that combined with the open railings will hopefully allow floodwaters to pass beneath and over the bridge with less damage to the bridge and making it less of an obstruction that can cause increased flooding upstream.

In addition to ramps for wheelchair access the bridge will have eight-foot sidewalks on both sides. “That’s something we really pushed for because we have a lot of pedestrian activity between downtown and the park” Keller said.

Memorial Park Bridge

This time the borough plans to replace the bridge between the main section of Memorial Park and “the island” in a way so that it won’t get washed away in the next flood Keller told the joint meeting.

And no surprise that means it will cost more money — $425000.

The bridge which was only a few years old was wiped out during the flash flood that hit the Manatawny Creek watershed in July 2019.

The high price is due in part to the borough’s decision to conduct a hydrological study of the creek “to make sure when we put the bridge back we’ll be placing it in a location where it will be less likely to be wash away in the future” said Keller.

“There’s also the probability it will need to be elevated higher than it was so the water can pass under it” he said.

The borough is awaiting word on a $275000 state grant for the project which would be combined with $75000 of borough funding and another $75000 from federal COVID-19 rescue funding.

“The grants are expected to be announced in October. It’s almost election season so you can expect a lot of grants to be announced in October” he said.

Over the Tracks

There are three bridges carrying South Franklin Street South Evans Street and South Washington Street over the Norfolk-Southern train tracks that run through the borough. “All three have been degrading over the years in terms of their structural integrity” said Keller.

“They’re not structurally deficient yet but if we don’t start getting ready to replace them” there could be a big problem.

The borough estimates that replacing all three could cost as much as $20 million a cost that will only continue to climb as building material prices are currently skyrocketing.

“I mean $20 million the borough is not going to pay all that” said Keller. “This is where we really need the federal infrastructure bill to get passed. That would help these bridges and really go a long way.”

In addition to the cost a further complication is that “part of these bridges are owned by the borough and part is owned by Norfolk-Souther” said Keller. “So we have to get Norfolk-southern to the table to fork up half the cost of replacement.”

Keller said the borough hopes to obtain $16 million in grants “with an 80 percent federal match and we would need about $4 million in borough funding over the next 10 years.”

Moser Road Bridge

This project “is a little more manageable” said Keller. “It’s not a replacement just some maintenance. We need to replace the shoes the bridge sits on” he said.

The cost for that project is $300000 for which the borough is looking to obtain $200000 in grants putting its portion at $100000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvc25sLXBheXMtdHJpYnV0ZS10by1ub3JtLW1hY2RvbmFsZC1pbi1zZWFzb24tcHJlbWllcmUvYXJ0aWNsZV9lZmIyMGNhYS00NThlLTUxMDMtYTc1Yy0yNDE5ZjE4YWQ5ZTMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'SNL' pays tribute to Norm Macdonald in season premiere,"Memphis TN (38111)

Tiger Woods who is currently recovering from a solo car crash is one of the best golfers of all time. He has won 82 PGA Tour trophies and 15 major championships in his career. But his career so far was filled with plenty of injuries. However despite all these adversities Tiger has always made an emphatic comeback and even won tournaments. So let us have a look at the list of injuries Tiger has had so far.

List of all the injuries Tiger Woods has suffered in his career

1. Tumor scar tissue removal (December 1994)

Even before Woods turned pro he underwent surgery to remove two benign tumors and scar tissues from his left knee. This surgery took place just after what is believed to be the biggest comeback victory in U.S. Amateur history at Ponte Vedra Beach Florida.

2. Cyst removal fluid drain (December 2002)

Tiger Woods had an exceptional 2002 season with two major wins at Masters and U.S. Open. However later that year he had to undergo surgery to remove a cyst from his left knee. Additionally Tiger had fluid drained from around one of his ligaments.

3. Shoulder (September 2006)

It is believed that 2006 was Tiger’s best year on the PGA Tour. He won 8 PGA Tours two majors and ten top-5s in 15 starts. However after this success Tiger suffered an injury to his left shoulder blade.

4. Ruptured ACL (July 2007)

After failing to finish in the top 10 at the Open Championship Tiger 31 back then ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while running at home. However deciding against the surgery Tiger pushed through to win five of his next six events.

5. Knee Surgery (April 2008)

After finishing 2nd at Masters Tiger had arthroscopic knee surgery to clean out cartilage. And with almost two months of recovery Tiger made a comeback in the U.S. Open against his doctor’s advice. But still Tiger managed to clinch his 14th major title.

6. ACL repair (June 2008)

Just one week after winning the U.S. Open however Tiger underwent reconstructive surgery on the damaged ACL and missed the remaining 2008 season. Moreover he also announced that he suffered a double stress fracture in his left tibia while preparing for the U.S. Open.

7. Torn Achilles tendon (December 2008)

Woods did not reveal until the 2010 Masters that he had torn his right Achilles tendon in 2008. Which also explains why his season was cut short after winning the U.S. Open. But still Tiger managed to remain at the top of the OWGR.

8. Neck injury (May 2010)

In 2010 during the last round of the Players Championship Tiger withdrew from the event because of a neck injury. Notably the MRI later revealed that he had an inflamed facet joint in his neck.

9. MCL sprain Achilles tendon strain (April 2011)

In the third round of Masters Tiger suffered a grade 1 mild MCL sprain to his left knee and mild strain to his left Achilles tendon after hitting a difficult and awkward second shot. However Tiger proved his resilience and tied for fourth place.

10. Back surgery (April 2014 September 2015 October 2015 April 2017 and January 2021)

For several months Tiger had back pain and missed multiple PGA Tour events. He underwent surgery for a microdiscectomy for a pinched nerve. And this injury marked the beginning of Woods’ challenging year of back problems. He struggled to recover from the back injury and had to undergo a second microdiscectomy surgery in the hopes of getting relief from the pain.

However in October 2015 the problem surfaced again as he was still feeling discomfort in his back.

After that he was injury-free until 2017 where in April he had a spinal fusion which was the fourth surgery on his troublesome back. After this Tiger came back to golf within a year to win the Tour Championship of 2018 and Masters in 2019. Furthermore Woods underwent his fifth back operation and fourth microdiscectomy surgery to remove a bone fragment that was pinching a nerve in January 2021.

11. Right leg ankle (February 2021)

Though this injury didn’t occur on course yet it was the most horrifying one. Woods had a solo car crash where his right leg and ankle were severely broken. Moreover he is still recovering from this injury and hopefully will be back playing golf at the highest level as soon as possible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cnVzdC5jb20vcHJvZmVzc29yLWFkYW11LWJhaWtpZS1hLXRydWUtYmxvb2Qtbm9ydGhlcm5lci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Professor Adamu Baikie: A True-Blood Northerner,"Genres of historical writing like biographies and autobiographies are often just as much about the subject as about the wider social contexts within which they lived thrived or whittled. As the personal is also social as Marx said the life of one individual can tell the story of a nation or a part of it.

Professor Adamu Baikie who clocked 90 years today is well known as a world-class scholar educator and university administrator. But his life also offers a prism through which we can glean the crisis of collective identity that has engulfed northern Nigeria in the past two decades or so. This identity crisis has had devastating consequences for Northern Nigerians at home and in their relationship with the rest of Nigeria—a country where politics remains firmly regional.

Once the pivot of power in the country the fortunes of the north are in their lowest ebb since at least 1905 when following British conquest the region became first a separate and later in 1914 a constituent part of Nigeria. The region is right now fiercely at war with itself on three fronts: insurgency banditry and communal conflicts. In each northerners are both the victims and also the perpetrators.

On top of these today’s northern Nigeria is plagued by worsening poverty stratospheric unemployment drug abuse and just about the worst indices of human development ever devised. Many reasons have been adduced for this turn of fortunes but perhaps the most significant is cultural not political or economic. The North has simply its sense of self at least within Nigeria’s political economic milieu.

Baikie is thus a reminder of it all. His life encapsulates a particular mode of being a northerner where being Hausa was not at odds with being Christian and both perfectly harmonized into an ideal identity that was yet realized in everyday personal social and professional life of service to region country and God.

“In all the places I served as vice chancellor” he once told this newspaper “I put three things into my head namely God the North and my family. These were my guiding principles. I worked to make sure I did not disappoint the people who sent me there and the people I represented”.

How many ‘northerners’ in public service or not have the ‘north’ as Baikie conceives it here in their thoughts today? It is this aspect of being a northerner above all that his 90th birthday reminds us all.

Baikie was born in Wusasa Zaria in 1931 but grew up in the Sabon Gari area of Kano. Following primary education in this Kano in the late 1930s he attended the Middle School in Wusasa Zaria graduating in 1948. His illustrious teaching career began in Gusau in 1951 after three years of teacher-training education. Through a Northern Nigeria government scholarship in 1957 he returned to Zaria again for a five-year ‘diploma’ at the Nigerian College and upon graduation in 1962 was recruited by then newly created Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria. In between teaching and postgraduate study in the United States in the ensuing years he became the first professor of education in the North in 1971.

Most of Baikie’s life was therefore formed by two environments that were not only hubs for then still emerging regional colonial economy but also for forging that broader northern identity of old. Wusasa evolved first as a compromise settlement between the then Emir of Zaria and some of the early missionaries in northern Nigeria led by Dr Walter Miller who would also later set up in Kano.

The Zaria Emirate had initially accommodated Miller and the missions within the city walls and allowed them to continue their proselytizing activities among then adherents of traditional religions. But the Emirate soon frowned at Miller’s strategic targeting of Muslims for conversation to Christianity and in a demonstration of religious tolerance uncommon even in Britain of the day the Emirate gave the missionaries land outside of the city. Saint Bartholomew Anglican Church Wusasa the first ever of its in northern Nigeria grew out of that compromise in 1929 around the same time the first mosque was erected in London (1926).

Thus in the 1930s and beyond Wusasa flourished and would bequeath to the North and Nigeria such eminent sons and daughters as Aliyu Barau Dikko Yakubu Gowon Ishaya Audu Rhoda Mohammed among many others. Their Muslim or Hausa names were no coincidence either as this formed part of their very northern identity which for themselves and for the rest of society did not conflict with their Christian faith.

As Daily Trust columnist and former Executive Director of the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) Prof Jibrin Ibrahim describes it growing out of this setting was much the same as growing out of anywhere else in the North. “Now the church is what we call a Hausa Anglican church in which the language of worship is Hausa and the culture Is Hausa the religion is Christianity what that meant was we had a very open notion of what this northern Nigerian identity mean. Central to that identity for us was that it must be an inclusive northern Nigeria and that was our understanding of the NPC of the First Republic in terms of its approach to defining a northern Nigeria.”

Dikko in particular was a founding member of the Jam’iyyar Mutanen Arewa (JMA) a cultural association of northerners that soon morphed into the Northern People’s Congress (NPC) on the eve of self-government. But the ‘Mutanen Arewa’ in the JMA is instructive in itself: it was not just a name but an acceptance and expression of a common identity a common culture and a common destiny for all northerners of the day. That is why the JMA could swiftly metamorphose into the region’s foremost political organization in competition with others of its kind across the country.

And as Baikie himself recalls Sabon Gari too was formed through a similar process: “When the trains started going to Kano and there was influx of people from the South to the city the then Emir did not send them away. He carved a place for them; that is why we have Sabon Gari Kano largely dominated by southerners.

“Interestingly most of the Yoruba that went to Kano were Muslims and were also given another area. This is why we have Unguwan Ayagi in Kano today. So you can see how these people were accommodative without religious or ethnic discrimination. In fact the first deputy Wakilin Waje Kano was an Igbo man. His name was Mr. Egbe. He was turbaned by the Emir at the palace”.

Moreover it was in Kano that Baikie learned what it used to mean to be a northerner in the sense under consideration and from none other than his own father. As he retold it to the younger generations in the same interview above: “When my father joined the Kano Native Authority in the late 1920s he was known to be a Christian. He had his tribal marks and as such the people he was working with knew his tribe. Despite that he turned out to be one of the best workers the then Emir had.

“My father worked with Galadiman Kano and Emir Abdullahi Bayero. He was very well known and liked at the same time. They knew his religion but never discriminated against him… Whenever we went to see our father in the office nobody discriminated against us. Because of our visits to the palace we knew some of the Hakimai (district heads). In fact we even visited the Emir himself because our father usually sent us with Christmas cake to him. So he did not have any problem at all as a Christian working in the palace”.

In other words even though his father originally hailed from somewhere in present-day Borno State he and his children were accepted as Kanawa and Hausa itself a cultural marker that went much beyond any specific ‘tribe’ language or faith in the northern Nigeria of Baikie’s youth—and long after. His first encounter with the late Sardauna while at the Nigerian College brought this home and remained fresh in his mind. In his own words:

“We didn’t know any other person than Sardauna Ahmadu Bello the then Premier of the Northern Region. There was absolutely no issue of religion tribe or any other sentiment. When we were in the Nigerian College all the northern students irrespective of where they came from were on the northern Nigerian scholarship. I was the president Northern Students Association so I was responsible for ensuring that the allowances were paid.

“I was the one who checked the list and if I certified the list the payment would be effected. So there was no discrimination at all. I can remember that when there was a strike at the Nigerian College Sardauna came down to Zaria with his top ministers like Isa Kaita Makaman Bidda Ibrahim Gashash Abba Habeeb among others and asked for the leader of the northern students. And I was the one. We sat together and he asked us about our welfare and other things. He also advised us not to isolate ourselves from other students from other parts of the country.”

That northern sense of self was no accident of history or culture. It was adroitly devised and cultivated for most of the preceding century by far-sighted leaders of the region chief among them the late Sardauna of whom Baikie and nearly all northerners of his generation still talk about with both gush and regret in their voice.

What Sardauna and his associates did—and the northern Emirs before them—was to give everyone in the north a sense of self they could with pride claim as theirs; and share as one with others from Maiduguri to Ilorin and from Sokoto to Lokoja regardless of creed or tongue. After all social identity is primarily an ideological project which leaders with skill everywhere have used to hold disparate groups of people together as one.

That northern identity has all but vanished today. And yet Baikie’s life which we celebrate today teaches us that we must reclaim it if the region must remain at peace with itself within a wider Nigerian politics that has only grown much harsher. What changed along the way? How did the change happen? And how can the past be reclaimed to reshape the present and the future?

These are sociological questions for which no easy answers exist. But we must try. The north has always had its socio-economic disadvantages especially in the area of education which Baikie and others sacrificed their whole lives to redress. The region has also always been politically divided as exemplified by the fierce ideological battles between the Northern Elements Progressive Union (NEPU) and the Northern Peoples’ Congress (NPC) in both the regional capital in Kaduna and the federal centre in Lagos in the 1950s and early 60s.

But despite its socio-economic disadvantage and political division the idea of northern Nigeria that was handed down up to the 1980s and which generations of northerners before then strove all their lives to uphold always had ambition both for itself and in relation to the rest of Nigeria. That ambition was to remain one and build from the ground up.

A clear sense of self an identity is of course sine qua non for any social progress. The North’s real strength was always in its identity: its cultural harmony in diversity was a source pride at home and of envy beyond. If the north faces daunting challenges today across every facet of life and it does it is because that ambition that collective sense of a shared purpose has broken down and with it everything else. It simply no longer means the same to be a ‘northerner’ as it did only a generation or two ago.

But if this points towards what has changed it does not say much about how the change has occurred nor to a possible remedy. For these we may have to look farther. In his Stories Identities and Political Change (2002) the American Sociologist Charles Tilly makes the important point that a given social identity however long established can change quite quickly once political opportunities shift to a different direction.

This happens Tilly says because social and political identities are sustained or turn apart by what he calls “stories” that is the narratives members of a given collective—however large or small—tell themselves about ‘we’ and ‘them’. Once the stories change everything else changes with it and tonight’s brothers would suddenly turn strangers by morning. This is precisely what the philosopher and Nobel Laureate for Economics Amartya Sen calls ‘imagined singularity’ in his Identity and Violence: The Illusion of Destiny (2002).

As Sen recollects of his own 1940s India that he witnessed “with the bewildered eyes of a child—the massive identity shifts that followed divisive politics. A great many persons’ identities as Indians as Asians or as members of the human race seemed to give way—quite suddenly—to sectarian identification with Hindu Muslim or Sikh communities. The same people were suddenly different” as people were made to “discover” their new identities without much critical examination.

This process by which a broad-based social identity such as ‘Indian’ suddenly splinters—another sociological term—into several narrower identities occasioned by changing social and political narratives was replicated in many different parts of the world in the past century: Ireland Lebanon the former Yugoslavia and nearer home in Rwanda where the same social groups who had shared the same small parcel of land for centuries and were deeply linked by similar culture and intermarriage suddenly turned different people—and in each case with serious consequences.

With complicated local inflexions this is also the story of northern Nigeria in the past two decades or so. To be a northerner for much of the 20th century was to belong to a cultural and political community in which you were one with others across the entire region regardless of creed or tongue. By the late 1970s however and particularly in the 1990s onwards this broad-based northern identity began to crack and in the wake of the Sharia riots of the early 2000s it splintered into pieces.

Cultural categories such as ‘the core North’ ‘the Muslim North’ ‘the Middle Belt’ (read the Christian North) ‘Southern Kaduna’ ‘indigenes’ ‘settlers’ and so on began to float freely in everyday social and political discourses as new referents for the same people who only a generation ago ‘northerners’ or quite simply Hausa would suffice. The change in the stories about identity which these new referents suggest was not overnight or as dramatic as elsewhere but the outcomes have been much the same.

The sociological—and historical—lesson is clear. Whenever the stories that sustain a broad-based identity change the identities shift or splinter. And when a broad-based identity splinters violence follows. But in this case there was a further splintering of the splinted: Muslim was not enough: ‘Izala’ ‘Dariqa’ or ‘Shiite’ mattered too that is the further splintering of the splinted leading all the way to Boko Haram. The rest is history still present.

The precise moment at which this change occurred is difficult to locate and the factors which inform it rather quite complicated but recent work by Nigerian sociologist Ebenezer Obadare provides a few pointers. In Pentecostal Republic: Religion and the Struggle for State Power in Nigeria (2018) Obadare makes three interesting arguments beyond his overall point that there has a been a ‘Pentecostal domination’ of Nigerian politics since return to democracy in 1999.

First Obadare says Pentecostal Christianity in Nigeria saw the whole debate about Sharia in many northern states as a political and cultural affront and mobilized all rhetorical resources to cast Muslims off as a religious ‘Other’ to be kept at arm’s length. Second Obadare argues Muslims responded by adopting the same scaremongering tactics. All these he concludes “‘provided an impetus for Muslim revivalism and charismatisation” which strengthened Islamic politics but also pushed it towards uncharted waters like Boko Haram.

Obadare’s work suggests that Muslim clerics were responding to political action by Christian Pentecostalism. He would have been just as correct if he said it was the other way around. By the late 1980s and early 1990s in many northern towns and cities there had sprung up all sorts of Muslim religious revisionism that redefined who was a Muslim and who was not. The language of this debate was intense unguarded and often quite out-rightly dangerous and inciting. This was a wholly internal Muslim affair but it would alarm any neighbour. The adoption of Sharia by many northern states though coming out of a separate impulse became the high point of this Muslim revivalism.

In other words the ideological clash and subsequent changing narratives between what and how Christians and Muslims thought of each other in Nigeria during this period was the beginning of the end for the broad-based northern identity that Baikie and his generation knew. It was also what the late Sardauna strove all his political life to avoid because he knew and knew again that once you found a religious crack in the northern firewall all else would be lost. That crack is now a chasm which cities like Kaduna and Jos bring to sharp relief every day.

Can this wide chasm ever be bridged again? Could the north that Baikie and others knew and served ever be reclaimed? And how? As Professor Adamu Baikie enters into his tenth decade on earth no doubt these questions would trouble his mind. But perhaps they should trouble the minds of the younger generation more.",,,,,,,,,

The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) for many years has been struggling to develop technology that can find track target and explode an incoming intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) traveling through space. It has been focused on achieving this feat because America's potential adversaries employ sophisticated decoys and countermeasures.

An ICBM can travel with phony missile decoys or travel amid space debris and clutter. These factors can disrupt the targeting sensors of a kill vehicle sent to intercept and destroy an ICBM. This is why the MDA and defense industry have been redesigning seekers kill vehicles guidance technology and targeting systems to ensure that an ICBM's interceptors can make discernments that allow them to find and eliminate the correct target.

These factors form the essential conceptual basis upon which the MDA has launched its Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) program a technical effort to engineer new missile defense systems capable of replacing and moving beyond the existing Ground-Based Interceptor. The program has been underway for several years. It calls for a next-generation technology better positioned to track and destroy incoming ICBM threats expected in 2030 and beyond.

The MDA has awarded several developmental deals to various defense industry teams including a Lockheed Martin-Aerojet team and a Northrop Grumman-Raytheon team. Both are competing for the opportunity to produce and deliver the NGI. While much of the specifics are likely proprietary or unavailable for security reasons new NGIs are likely to operate with multiple kill vehicles meaning a single interceptor will operate and release several actual interceptors that collide with and destroy multiple threats. This technique which defense industry contractors have been developing over the years enables a weapon to detect threats from decoys and countermeasures while firing multiple interceptors at a volley of enemy ICBMs traveling through the air.

A Lockheed Martin press statement highlights some of the challenges associated with the existing Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system. It notes that the existing GBI is obsolete and as with any weapon there is a limit or point at which a legacy system can no longer be upgraded to keep pace with existing threats.

“While recent tests demonstrate the promise of the system the interceptor has reached a point where it can no longer be simply updated to meet the demand” according to the Lockheed press statement.

In an attempt to bridge this gap the US Air Force is planning to equip its Cold-War-era B-1 bombers with hypersonic weaponry until its super-advanced B-21 stealth bomber is ready for induction.

The B-1B Lancer is a multi-role long-range bomber. It can fly intercontinental missions without refueling and can also penetrate current and potential advanced enemy defenses.

This Cold War-era bomber was originally designed to carry nuclear weapons onboard. Throughout 1991 the B-1 was a part of the single integrated operational plan (SIOP) and served its nuclear deterrence role under the same.

The conversion of the B-1B to a conventional role was a gradual process that began in 1993. The conversion was completed in October 1997. The bomber is capable of performing a wide variety of missions including missions that require a conventional weapons carrier for theater operations.

The B-1B’s low radar cross-section is complemented by electronic jamming equipment infrared countermeasures radar location and warning systems. Together they form an integrated defense system for the aircraft.

The bomber’s swing-wing design and turbofan engines grant it greater range and high speed at low levels. Additionally they enhance the bomber’s survivability. Once the B-1B is airborne the wings are positioned for the greatest cruise distance or high-speed penetration.

The bomber has several world records for speed payload and distance to its credit.

Hypersonic Missile Test

The US plans to add hypersonic weapons to these mighty aircraft that are currently stationed at Dyess Air Force Base. This will essentially turn the B-1 into a ‘missile truck’.

The Cold War-era external weapons carriage capability of the bomber will be reactivated to accommodate the new munitions. Reportedly the work to reactivate the hardpoints of the B-1 has already begun. Six of the eight external hardpoints of the B-1 can be reinstated.

It has been confirmed that the modified B-1 bomber will act as the launch platform for boost-glide vehicles as well as air-breathing missiles. This hints towards the potential utilization of the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid-Response Weapon and the Hypersonic Air-Breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) respectively.

Boeing officials highlighted how the project will enhance the existing B-1 fleet keeping the B-1 mission active till the Air Force transitions to the B-21 Raider.

The bomber which was earlier equipped for conventional combat will not be dropping bombs like it used to but would send them at Mach speeds toward a distant target.

How the plan shapes us will depend on the funding of the project which won’t be cheap.

The USAF is simultaneously also continuing on with its plans to withdraw the B-1 from service. Most recently it sent 17 of the 60 remaining aircraft to the boneyard.

The planned weapons upgrades for the B-1 are increasingly being viewed not just as a means of keeping up with the rapid hypersonic weapons developments in Russia and China but also as a way of providing cover for the B-52H Stratofortress fleet.

This fleet is currently undergoing improvements which include an ambitious re-engining program that will see fleet availability reduced while it is underway.

With the B-21 slated to enter the service from the mid-2020s the B-1 might not actually have a lot of time left to serve.

The B-21 Raider

Frank Kendall the US Air Force Secretary recently announced that Northrop Grumman is producing five B-21 Raider stealth bomber test aircraft at its Palmdale facility in California the Eurasian Times had earlier reported.

The Raider program will utilize decades worth of experience gathered from the development and production of the B-2 stealth bomber. Open-source information regarding the program shows that the B-21 is likely to be a stealth aircraft.

It will probably have systems in place to allow manned as well as unmanned flight. As an Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) it could be armed with a wide variety of deadly weapons.

There is much speculation over the kind of sensors that will be onboard the Raider. It may come equipped with a sensor similar to the ones the F-35 boasts of. These are top-of-the-line electro-optical targeting systems that enhance the air-to-ground capabilities of the fighter.

The first operational examples of the B-21 are expected to enter service at the Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota sometime in the mid-2020s.

Until the development of the B-21 as well as the transition to this model is complete the B-1 bomber will be upgraded and lined up with hypersonic missiles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvbmF2eSVFMiU4MCU5OXMtbmV3LWFudGktcmFkaWF0aW9uLW1pc3NpbGUtYnJpbmctcnVzc2lhLWFuZC1jaGluYS10b2dldGhlci0xOTQ1NjbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Navy's New Anti-Radiation Missile Is Bring Russia and China Together,"No it’s not some doomsday weapon — but it will give the Navy a potent capability nonetheless.

Here's what you need to remember: Despite their awe-inspiring name in actuality anti-radiation missiles have nothing to do with nuclear power and radiation following nuclear explosions. Instead they are an anti-air defense weapon typically fired from the air at targets on the ground though in some cases they can also be fired at other aircraft.

No it’s not some doomsday weapon — but it will give the Navy a potent capability nonetheless.

The United States Navy will receive a new missile into service the AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile – Extended Range (AARGM-ER).

Northrop Grumman the AARGM-ER manufacturer explains that their missile is a “supersonic air-launched tactical missile system. It has the capability to perform Destruction of Enemy Air Defense missions and is an upgrade to the U.S. Navy AGM-88 HARM system. AARGM is able to rapidly engage traditional and advanced land- and sea-based air-defense threats as well as non-radar time-sensitive strike targets.”

Furthermore the company’s “next-generation AARGM Extended Range (AARGM-ER) program for the U.S. Navy is building upon AARGM currently in production. By leveraging AARGM sensors and electronics the addition of a new rocket motor and warhead AARGM-ER will provide advanced capability to detect and engage long-range adversary air defense systems.”

Anti-radiation

Despite their awe-inspiring name in actuality anti-radiation missiles have nothing to do with nuclear power and radiation following nuclear explosions. Instead they are an anti-air defense weapon typically fired from the air at targets on the ground though in some cases they can also be fired at other aircraft.

Anti-radiation missile’s mode of operation is simple: they home in on enemy radio emissions. Generally speaking they home in ground-based radar stations used to detect enemy aircraft and direct surface-to-air missiles. However fighter jets can also use anti-radiation missiles to take out smaller radio communication stations or radar jamming equipment.

The earliest anti-radiation missiles were quite simple. Programmed to follow or ‘ride’ radio waves to their source they would explode when close to a radio emission source. The best defense against these early missiles was turning off radio comms denying the missiles a path to follow. Once destroyed or no longer airborne air defense operators could again turn on their radio equipment.

More advanced anti-radiation missiles countered radio silence by incorporating an inertial guidance system into their flight guidance allowing the missile to ‘remember’ where the radio source had been. Once turned off a missile could use the radio signal’s last known location to plot a course to the target.

The most modern anti-radiation missiles can loiter in the air for extended periods of time moving closer to radio emission sources as they are activated even intermittently.

Postscript

Although the AARGM-ER’s range is difficult to determine definitively it is thought to be around double its predecessor. If true the AARGM-ER’s range would be greater than 222 kilometers or about 140 miles. Following a recent successful live-fire event the missile is slated for integration onto the Navy’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler and the Air Force F-35A Marine Corps F-35B and Navy and Marine Corps F-35C.

The Surface Laptop Studio features a brand-new design that enables the display to be pulled forward and laid flat over the keyboard when wanting to write or draw Microsoft calls this ""Studio mode"" and is great for creators or those who want to use the touchscreen flat. There's also a ""tent mode"" that props the display up between the trackpad and keyboard great for watching movies.

The design makes for a more elegant solution over the Surface Book series which features a detachable display breaking away from the keyboard into a standalone tablet. With the Studio Laptop occupying a similar space to the Surface Book 3 refreshed in early 2020 that detachable display is the main reason to still opt for the older device.

The Surface Laptop Studio is all about performance designed with creatives and power users in mind as reflected by the hardware under the hood. The range is expected to significantly outperform newly updated devices like the Surface Pro 8 and Surface Go 3 ideal for intensive software like Photoshop or 4K video editing.

Various long-requested hardware upgrades also help fortify the Surface Laptop Studio as its most powerful device to date aiding productivity while on the move. New Thunderbolt 4 support sees a significant leap in connectivity allowing for faster transfer rates and support for more external devices like multiple 4K displays. The onboard 120Hz refresh rate also improves on-device fluidity providing smoother interactivity for productivity and gaming.

Other new features include support for the Surface Slim Pen with a hidden charging cradle underneath the front of the laptop. Magnets will hold the pen in place while charging allowing you to store the pen and carry it with the device.

Also new to the Surface Laptop Studio is a new ""Precision Haptic"" touchpad which means the touchpad itself is static and no longer moves when clicked. Instead special haptic engines underneath the touchpad vibrate to make it feel as if you're clicking down similar to Apple's MacBook touchpads.

Microsoft also claims buyers can expect improvements in battery life with up to 19 hours available slightly surpassing the 17.5 hours seen with the latest Surface Book 3. The overall device dimensions and weight while larger than many existing Surface products also undercut the Surface Book 3 lineup.

The Surface Laptop Studio presents a new form factor in Microsoft's premium PC lineup suited to high-end productivity. While we'll need to wait until our full review for final impressions it's a promising option for creatives and power users with a need for speed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibmEuYmgvZW4vaG1raW5naXNzdWVzZGVjcmVlNDYvTlZUQ3BhcnRuZXJzd2l0aE5WSURJQURlZXBMZWFybmluZ0luc3RpdHV0ZXRvcHJvdmlkZW9ubGluZUFJY291cnNlcy5hc3B4P2Ntcz1xOEZtRkpnaXNjTDJmd0l6T04xJTJCRG9semhuTkFZVWtGdHRySE9FeGJPeG8lM0TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVTC partners with NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute to provide online AI courses,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bna.bh/en/hmkingissuesdecree46/NVTCpartnerswithNVIDIADeepLearningInstitutetoprovideonlineAIcourses.aspx?cms=q8FmFJgiscL2fwIzON1%2BDolzhnNAYUkFttrHOExbOxo%3D on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibmEuYmgvZW4vaG1raW5naXNzdWVzZGVjcmVlNDYvTlZUQ3BhcnRuZXJzd2l0aE5WSURJQURlZXBMZWFybmluZ0luc3RpdHV0ZXRvcHJvdmlkZW9ubGluZUFJY291cnNlcy5hc3B4P2Ntcz1xOEZtRkpnaXNjTDJmd0l6T04xJTJCRG9semhuTkFZVWtGdHRySE9FeGJPeG8lM0TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2Jlcy5jby5pbC9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUuYXNweD9kaWQ9MTAwMTM4NTg2MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Israel has major role to play in Intel revival,"Intel is at one of the lowest points it has ever known. It has lost its lead in the chip market to rivals who have overtaken it in both mobile and artificial intelligence and have figured out Intel’s sophisticated production methods. It has suffered ongoing CEO churn employee defection to competitors and criticism about a closed-off corporate culture. The share trails competitors like Nvidia and Qualcomm - even though Intel has more sales than any of them.

At the same time the US semiconductor giant is intensifying its hold on the Israeli technology industry. Its total chip exports from Israel last year reached an all-time high of $8 billion - double that of just six years ago - despite concerns among workers that the local plant’s expansion would be delayed under former CEO Bob Swan. Out of total tech exports Intel accounted for no less than 14% another record and at a time when Israeli tech is at a peak. Intel has also been critical to domestic product at a record rate of about 2%.

This is a reciprocal relationship. Intel's Israeli operations are at the heart of its recovery strategy. New CEO Pat Gelsinger who was appointed at the beginning of this year wants to bring Intel back to its heyday. Gelsinger has outlined the areas where Intel’s Israeli centers have an inherent advantage: computer and server chips fields led by Intel Haifa in the 1990s and early 2000s; artificial intelligence (AI) chips and automotive chips through massive investment in Habana Labs in Caesarea and Mobileye in Jerusalem; and reentering the competition for Israeli engineers who in the interim have been in fierce demand by giants like Amazon Nvidia and Facebook and young semiconductor startups.

How did the PC revolution flagship become a company forced to reinvent itself? Veteran staffers from Intel and other chip giants have some answers. Some see Intel's 'original sin' as not having identified the mobile revolution in time others think it fumbled the AI market and still others blame the management style of former CEO Brian Krzanich.

Missing out on the mobile revolution

Mobile chips have long outstripped computers and servers in terms of market size. Some believe that Intel's failure to identify the revolution served this sector on a silver platter to competitors like Qualcomm Samsung and TSMC.

In the mid-2000s Apple CEO Steve Jobs asked then-Intel CEO Paul Otellini to provide chips for the first iPhone. But Otellini thought the offer was too low and that adapting Intel's high-performance CPU to small phones would require a lot of effort. Jobs then turned to Samsung and the rest is history. A few years later Apple began to develop its own chips with production at the TSMC factory in Taiwan that competes head-to-head with Intel. Ironically the person who oversees all of Apple's semiconductor operations is Johny Srouji formerly of Intel Haifa.

Intel has made several failed attempts to gain a foothold in the smartphone market. It acquired Infineon’s mobile chip division for $1.4 billion and invested capital on customers like LG for them to make devices based on its chip. Nonetheless Qualcomm has maintained its lead. Intel’s preference has been computer and server chips - with sophisticated performance capabilities - over mobile chips where compromises must be made to extend battery life.

""Nvidia did an Intel on Intel""

AI and machine learning was another missed opportunity. Once perceived as a small niche market for robotics or computer game developers today these clearly form the infrastructure for countless fields including cybersecurity automotive smart speakers virtual reality and more.

""Artificial intelligence is ubiquitous today and Intel hasn’t devoted enough time and thought to the matter ""a former senior executive at the company tells ""Globes."" ""It was a gaming company Nvidia that developed the field. Up until then it was known as a graphics processing unit (GPU) developer for gamers who wanted to optimize their hardware to support high-performance computer games. Nvidia’s value soared on the strength of that achievement and today its market cap is double that of Intel even though Intel sells a lot more chips.""

Thanks to the software layer developed for its CUDA GPU Nvidia has become a monopoly holding 81% of the AI processor market according to research firm Omdia. Despite competition from higher quality chips designed by companies like Google AMD Xilinx and even Intel itself Nvidia continued to benefit from its supremacy in the market thanks to its proprietary software environment. ""Engineers won’t want to learn a new software language just to work with Intel hardware"" the former senior executive tells ""Globes."" ""Nvidia did to Intel what Intel had done to the world with its software monopoly that worked only on its own x86 microprocessor that unquestionably dominated the desktop laptop and server markets for years. In other words Nvidia did an Intel on Intel to beat it in the future.""

Intel can no longer be changed by fax

As mentioned some attribute the company's current situation to Krzanich’s management style. Krzanich who served as CEO from 2013 to 2018 was known for overreacting to criticism and strident arguments that sometimes devolved into ridicule and humiliation of others. The result: overlooked problems on the production line postponements delays and missed opportunities. During his tenure for the first time Intel failed in what it had always known how to do better than anyone else throughout its history: launch the most technologically advanced chips.

Intel was the first to launch a 14-nanometer production line in 2015 but the launch of its next technology 10-nanometers was delayed first by six months and then by three years with ramifications for the Kiryat Gat fab. The delay not only caused a great deal of embarrassment it also caused Dell one of Intel's major customers to cut its sales forecast by $1 billion last year according to research by Bloomberg. Those junior engineers who warned Krzanich were ignored.

In his new book Molikhim l’Hatzlakha ""Conducting to Success"" David ""Dadi"" Perlmutter the most senior Israeli ever to serve at Intel (as EVP and General Manager of the Intel Architecture Group and Chief Product Officer) tells of a time when the organizational culture was bottom-up. In 1992 junior employees in Israel sent a fax to CEO Andy Grove that changed the company's destiny. Perlmutter and two other engineers wanted to maintain good relations with Microsoft and did not want to rewrite the CPU’s core software. The move planned by the management they cautioned could harm the applications environment already developed on top of the Intel layer and thus harm its competitive advantage.

""The bottom line is that this fax resulted in the Pentium processor which changed the personal computing world by turning every IBM-compatible PC into a product found in every home"" writes Perlmutter (who refused comment for this article).

Krzanich’s term was eventually marked by a wave of departures of executives that included Perlmutter. Roni Friedman who led the development of the advanced PC semiconductors left for Apple. Shlomit Weiss who was general manager of the Data Center Group Silicon Development went to rival Nvidia; she recently returned to Intel as Senior Vice President and Co-General Manager of the Design Engineering group. A host of other VPs and senior executives at Intel's Santa Clara headquarters also resigned.

But it is possible that Krzanich’s appointment was only a symptom and not the cause. As one former Intel executive put it: ""You don’t get a heart attack in a day it’s the result of decades of unhealthy nutrition. The mobile division has suffered from a lack of investment for decades. Even a legend like Andy Grove decided not to invest there even though the first processor Nokia ever used was the famous 386 by Intel.""

Another former executive tells ""Globes"" that ""Intel was blinded by success. It refused to see what its competitors were seeing and in retrospect the CEOs it appointed in the last few decades made it a different company. It started out as a group of entrepreneurs with PhDs in engineering and chemistry but over the past 20 years it’s appointed CEOs from manufacturing or finance. These people had technical or financial understanding but no vision.""

Empires fall slowly

The loss of its advantage in manufacturing development and design of new chips has taken a toll on Intel’s prestige and market value. The considerable price gap between Intel’s share lagging far behind Nvidia and AMD has only widened since the outbreak of the Covid-19 global pandemic.

Nvidia as mentioned has become the AI chip market leader. It is also gaining the lead in the data center market with its super-processing GPU and is expected to acquire ARM an intellectual property (IP) titan for low-power CPUs.

At the same time AMD is nipping at Intel’s heels in chips for the home market desktops and laptops and has even overtaken it technologically with a more advanced generation (7-nanometers). Market experts believe that AMD’s new server chips outperform Intel’s and threaten its market hegemony.

Meanwhile tech giants including Google and Facebook are in the process of setting up chip development departments for their data centers and additional electronic products. Only a few months ago Uri Frank who was GM of Intel’s Core & Client Development Group moved to manage hardware development as VP Engineering at Google. Project manager Ofer Weissman today holds a similar position on Facebook and there are others.

In manufacturing too Intel lost the lead to TSMC which has overtaken it with advanced technologies. The Taiwanese giant has launched chips fabricated using 7- and 10-nanometer technology and is preparing to launch 3-nanometer chips next year. Meanwhile Intel is struggling to open 7-nanometer fabs with plans for a 4-nanometer factory in Arizona in a few years. TSMC grew under its partnership with Apple and now serves almost all chip developers without their own production facilities including Amazon Nvidia Qualcomm Broadcom and AMD. Apple has already unveiled its strategy to jettison Intel in favor of a range of new Mac chips manufactured by TSMC.

""Pentium Pat"" to the rescue

The half-dozen former Intel executives interviewed by ""Globes"" were unanimous: appointing new CEO Pat Gelsinger is a brilliant move. The right man at the right time. A symbol of the Intel of yesteryear. A protégé of legendary CEO Andy Grove in his first post-graduate job Gelsinger learned professional management tempered with humility. He is a technologist who was Intel's first VP technology. He then served as CEO at VMware as president and VP operations at EMC and at additional software companies where he experienced corporate cultures other than Intel. He is passionate about restoring Intel’s dominance in chip manufacture to the West chiefly the US.

In the Israeli context Gelsinger's appointment is good news too. Gelsinger gave his imprimatur to Intel's biggest brand of the 1980s the 486 chip. He advanced the next generation the Pentium whose development group included a great number of Israelis. Managers in Israel who knew him then still call him ""Pentium Pat."" During his tenure EMC and VMware expanded their operations in Israel and made local acquisitions.

As mentioned a large part of Intel's rehabilitation strategy depends on Israel: chips and components for AI automotive servers and PCs. Small wonder that Gelsinger visited Israel recently announcing his intention to recruit a thousand workers and open another development center. But unlike Krzanich Gelsinger understands Intel's limits knows where to invest and where to concede.

Last month Intel workers in Israel had a front-row seat to the company’s cutbacks. Smaller acquisitions made in Israel dealing in areas that have always been considered trivial and not part of Intel’s core activity - like sports imaging developer Replay Technologies and 3D sensor printed circuit board developer InVision Biometrics - were swiftly shut down by Gelsinger.

Giving up privilege - Focusing on the main thing

He is also willing to give up Intel’s privilege transferring manufacturing of the company's less significant chips to competitors like TSMC and repositioning Intel as a third-party manufacturer that will produce for others including the competition in addition to itself. This latest move achieves a principle coined by the legendary Andy Grove: ""Intel has one goal: our plants must always run at full capacity because a plant that doesn’t utilize 100% of its capabilities is a losing enterprise.""

At the same time Gelsinger will invest $100 billion in the construction and upgrade of new plants of which $20 billion this year is for construction of two new factories in Arizona and $3.5 billion to upgrade the New Mexico plant. It also sets into motion plans for the new Kiryat Gat fab which was delayed under former CEO Swan a $10 billion investment of which $4 billion are government grants. The new plant is expected to be operational in 2024.

Gelsinger has his sights set on Europe and has stated that Intel intends to spend about $100 billion on plants in Europe (assumed to be in Ireland Germany or Poland) including fabs for automotive chips designed in Israel. The goal is to return Intel to the forefront of global chip production using Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) - a technology that prints circuits thinner than a single hair. Intel is also examining a new business model that will enable it to compete with Apple partner ARM and sell its chip IP including to competitors.

By 2025 the company intends to launch the 18A chip whose electrical circuits are measured not in nanometers the currently accepted standard but in Angstrom (one-tenth of a nanometer). Intel not alone: TSMC has already announced that it will invest a similar amount in new plants in Taiwan Korea China and even near Intel’s Arizona factory.

In doing so Intel hopes to restore the glory days of its founder Gordon Moore whose Moore's Law predicted that the density of transistors in integrated circuits would double every year and a half to two years without increasing production costs. He assumed - and rightly so - that Intel would succeed in minimizing the size of its electronic circuits for each subsequent generation. That held true at least until the company began missing out allowing the Asian manufacturers to get around it.

Gelsinger plans to invest tens of billions more acquiring another chipmaker with GlobalFoundries reportedly the target. The $30 billion company an Intel competitor owned by a UAE-based fund manufactures chips in Europe. GlobalFoundries is currently indicating it is not interested in an acquisition and prefers going public instead.

Intel’s surprising geopolitical role

Two trends - economic and geopolitical - play in Intel’s favor increasing the West’s dependence on it and giving it a role it never dreamed it would take on. Intel may be the Western world’s last chipmaker a kind of ""Silicon Curtain"" should China invade Taiwan - which today seems more likely than ever before. Intel also benefits from the current chip market shortage where every manufacturer is critical to the continued production of vehicles phones and laptops.

Intel is encouraged by the huge demand for electronics and computer products that intensified with the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic which kept hundreds of millions of people at home. The company estimates this huge demand will increase a thousand-fold within four years - equaling Moore's Law times five.

This new spirit has brought senior executives back: Shlomit Weiss returned from Nvidia to co-manage the Design Engineering group alongside US-based Sunil Shenoy another leaver who returned as Senior VP. ""Gelsinger can be unusually aggressive and he won’t keep the company the way it is today"" a senior executive familiar with Gelsinger tells ""Globes."" ""He's a man of decision and action - which is how he can save it or kill it. It's intriguing to see which way Intel will go with him.""

The challenges for Intel Israel

Intel Israel in the Gelsinger era faces a dual challenge: reviving the corporate culture to make it once again the market’s most attractive employer and fulfilling an increasingly significant role in server and AI chips the strategic markets targeted by Intel HQ.

Although its workforce is gradually increasing Intel actually declined in the Israeli perception as an attractive place to work. In the BDiCode Best Companies to Work For list the company moved down the top ten ranking for 2019 and 2020 after many years of vying with Google for top spot.

The Intel employee profile has also changed. One senior chip development manager who hires hardware engineers [name withheld by request] says that Intel used to attract the best elite university graduates year after year with outstanding engineers traveling daily to Haifa from Tel Aviv and the central region.

Today he says long-standing employees are leaving Intel equipped with specific narrow expertise and without the tools to help them integrate into other companies. ""What people have absorbed there over 10-15 years doesn’t really match what can be absorbed at other companies for that time"" he says. Seniority among Intel employees for better or worse is also reflected in the data: According to LinkedIn Intel employees have a median seniority of 6.1 years the highest compared to its competitors; median seniority at Nvidia is 3.6 years and 3.3 years at Apple.

""There's a veteran ethos there folks who worked at Oregon HQ and 'lugged their transistors on their backs' - as they say in the lunchroom - tough quality engineers not like their competitors at Qualcomm who just know how to send an email to TSMC"" says one industry executive well-acquainted with the Intel workforce. ""But the sheer size of the company sometimes makes it difficult to move quickly and when one division head gets replaced by another it's like a body that’s had its head replaced.""

Intel has also suffered in recent years from employee attrition in favor of its rivals. Apparently the number of new employees has stagnated in the last two years.

Intel's makeover

The Gelsinger era indeed cut Intel's peripheral activities in Israel with more waves of cutbacks expected to rock the company in the near future. But Intel recruitment executives along with employees who know the company from the inside report a recent reversal in trend. ""Intel has begun battling to retain good employees and hermetically seal the talent drain. Likewise their proposed salaries to new hires are highly competitive."" One example obtained by ""Globes"" proposes a salary signing fee and bonus comparable to Amazon or Apple. In late August Intel recruited a senior hardware architect from Apple Israel.

Intel has hired about 1000 development workers this year and is still hiring staff for about 400 vacancies. Among the largest groups hired: server cloud and communications and a new AI driven WiFi group. Another new group formed to compete with Mellanox in data center processors is managed by Ilan Avital VP Engineering Network and Edge Group.

An employee familiar with Intel's hiring policy tells ""Globes"" that among potential recruits Intel has a very good image regarding work-life balance. ""Apple pays well but is considered a very rigid workplace without a good balance between leisure and work and work is a small part of Apple's hardware especially in communications"" he says. ""Amazon pays great but in the end you're a small cog in the machine without global impact. Anyone who goes to work at Google's hardware division in Israel deals with a very narrow aspect of cloud CPUs. Life at Intel is much more comfortable with a good balance between leisure family and work. Engineers can work on big projects and affect processor development in countless areas: PCs servers and AI.""

""Willenz and Shashua stood their ground""

Intel needed to change its approach to acquisitions well. To date Intel has closed or sold many of its Israeli acquisitions including Replay Technologies RealSense Oplus Technologies and DSPC. ""Their method was similar"" says a former Intel executive. ""The day after the acquisition all employees underwent a series of training sessions about Intel and its organization culture their work systems were replaced and ultimately they were put into uniform Intel cubicles. Then for months they’d ask themselves how they could maintain the same level of output they’d had before Intel acquired them. That’s why Amnon Shashua of Mobileye and Avigdor Willenz of Habana Labs stood their ground about maintaining their companies’ independence at least for the first few years.""

Habana Labs is a key asset for Intel - and the success of its Caesarea operations will greatly impact Gelsinger's AI strategy versus giants like Nvidia and AMD. As mentioned Intel entered the machine learning sector by acquiring the AI chip developer in late 2019. The deal was considered ‘Too little too late’ and very costly. Habana has not yet launched a product and it will take time for Intel to integrate the technology into its server motherboards. But Habana’s expanding collaboration and possible acquisition by Facebook led Intel to make a $2 billion takeover bid rather a high sum for a company with no sales. It may be that taking veteran chipmaker Avigdor Willenz - the man behind a number of chip companies sold to giants like Amazon and Marvell - and turning him into a one-day-a-week Intel employee and AI consultant was worth it.

Habana’s technology is different to Intel’s as its chips are based on the competing ARM technology but Intel believes that incorporating its Xeon server chips into any board with a Habana chip can accelerate data center activity. The data center sector and the move to the cloud in general has become the biggest competitive arena between Intel Nvidia and even rival AMD. Intel market’s share has been damaged by Nvidia which offers AI processors and GPUs that help accelerate all data center network communications and deliver higher capabilities. It’s possible that to regain market share Intel will continue to make Israeli acquisitions in the data center sector and benefit from the growing number of startups in this industry such as Pliops or Hailo Technologies by acquiring one or two.

Deliver the goods or pay the price

Recognizing Intel's past failures in mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) chips Gelsinger wants to take Intel back to its halcyon days of high-performance complex computing chips and focus on high-power PC and server chips that demand higher capacity and far higher performance than mobile phone chips. This division which is responsible for $40 billion in annual revenue is retaking center stage with an Israeli management team that includes Shlomit Weiss SVP and co-GM of Design Engineering; Ran Berenson VP and GM of the Core and Client Development group; and Adi Yoaz Core CPU Chief Architect of Intel's new Alder-Lake chip.

Mobileye remains a sort of island within Intel: Amnon Shashua and his executives run it independently and decide for themselves the way Mobileye will wear the Intel team colors. Although its revenue is only a small slice of Intel's revenue at ""just"" $1 billion per year Gelsinger views Mobileye as Intel's future in the smart vehicle semiconductor market and its foothold in the automotive world. Intel estimates that the vehicle chip market will account for about one-fifth of all premium car components by 2030 and will account for about one-tenth of the global chip market. Intel which is the only company among its competitors to own an automotive chip company has the chance to dominate this field to the benefit of its Jerusalem development center. Although autonomous vehicles are still far from being commercially available next year Intel together with Mobileye will launch an experimental autonomous taxi fleet branded under the Moovit app that will manage ride-hailing services.

Will Intel Israel eventually grow during the Gelsinger era? It all depends on Intel Israel. ""Pat has known Intel Israel for decades and appreciates its contribution but if there’s one thing you can say about his management style it’s that he’s a cool calculated CEO who as we all saw recently knows where to cut and where not to"" says one former Intel executive. ""If Israel doesn’t deliver the goods it will pay the price.""

Despite the announcement about building a new fab in Israel and recruiting hundreds of workers Intel Israel will face increasing challenges in the coming years. Europe today at the far end of the semiconductor industry is making huge efforts to attract chip giants and the US government is ramping up investments targeted at bringing chip manufacturing back to the US. All could affect Intel’s local activity. Israel is on the right side of the ""Silicon Curtain"" and its leanings towards the US or China in the coming years are also likely to impact Intel's preference.

Sector insiders said the trend of outflow of women workers abroad would continue in the remaining months of this year.

They said the demand for women domestic helps had increased in recent days in Middle Eastern (ME) countries as the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic eased there.

According to the data of the Bureau of Manpower Employment and Training (BMET) 41076 women workers had gone abroad for employments during the January-August period this year.

Among them 27472 went to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 7874 to Jordan 3667 workers to Oman 1291 to Qatar and 509 to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

On the other hand a total of 21934 women went to different job destination countries in the previous (2020).

The BMET data showed that the recruitment of overseas jobs remained halted for three months (April-June) in 2020 due to different measures taken by the governments of the destination countries as the Cobid-19 was spreading fast in those countries during the period.

However migrant rights activists stressed the need for ensuring safety and security for women migrant workers as pandemic makes them more vulnerable than the male workers in workplaces.

Sumaiya Islam executive director (ED) of Bangladesh Nari Sramik Kendra-BNSK said women workers are facing different types of problems at their workplaces amid the pandemic.

Referring to the women workers' problems abroad the rights activist said that the workload of women domestic helps had increased manifolds during the period.

""Another problem was wage theft"" she said noting that a significant number of returnee female migrant workers failed to bring home their arrear wages and other dues from employers.

""So they are facing acute economic hardship now"" she said adding the government should help the female workers to get back wages from their job destination countries.

""Besides many also could not return home following the expiry of tenure of their job contracts. Such workers are not getting regular salaries. The authorities concerned should take immediate steps to resolve these issues"" she observed.

According to the data of BMET more than 0.9 million Bangladeshi women workers went abroad with jobs during the 1991 and 2019 periods. Most of them were recruited by the Middle Eastern nations as domestic assistants.

The competition began with 68 nominees. There were 41700 votes cast in the first three rounds of public voting. The Western Star truck drove to the top spot earning 2725 votes in the final round.

“Thanks to the NC Chamber and Old Dominion for their support of the Coolest Thing Made in NC” Erik Johnson plant manager of Cleveland Truck Manufacturing Plant Daimler Trucks North America said in a news release. “We’re incredibly proud of the products we build including the Western Star 49X and we’re prouder still of our workforce in the state helping to build those trucks with precision with quality and with dedication. We appreciate the recognition provided by this valuable program and look forward to next year’s contest.”

The city held a street party and strategic branding of the streetscape and the promotion and recapping of the event has garnered the city national attention for its revitalization efforts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vb2R1c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMTAvMy9tZW5zLXNvY2Nlci12ZXJzdXMtbWFyc2hhbGwtdXBkYXRlcy5hc3B40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ODU Men's Soccer Team Plays Even With No. 5 Marshall Before Falling 1-0 on Sunday - Old Dominion University,"By Harry Minium



For the entire first half and much of the second the Old Dominion men's soccer team played more than even with the nation's fifth-ranked team and defending national champion.



But Marshall broke a scoreless tie 13 minutes into the second half when Pedro Dolabella a graduate student from Brasila Brazil knocked in the rebound of his own shot to give the Thundering Herd a 1-0 lead they made stand up.



It was the first Conference USA victory for Marshall (6-1-3 overall 1-0-2 C-USA). ODU meanwhile fell to 2-5-1 and 0-2-1.



ODU played a conservative defensive game in the first half clogging up their own end in an effort to negate Marshall's superior size and speed and it worked.



ODU's Eliot Goldthorp almost gave ODU a 1-0 lead with 2:40 left in the first half when his shot hit the cross box and ricocheted back.



With 36 minutes left in the second half emotions overflowed when ODU's Ettore Casadei a freshman from Italy fouled Marshall's Joao Souza in front of both benches. Marshall and ODU players converged and there was enough pushing and shoving to perhaps warrant several yellow cards.



Instead Casadei emerged with the only yellow card and the Herd seemed energized.



Four minutes later Dolabelia lobbed a shot that was saved by ODU goalie Dijbril Doumbia but the rebound came Dolebelia who booted it into the net.



ODU coach Alan Dawson said the series of plays that led to that goal was his team's only serious letdown. Too many of the Herd players were left open he said.



""There's not one or two guys who I could point to but several"" he said. ""When you make a mistake like that good teams national championship teams they punish you.""



ODU had its chances to tie. With 26 minutes to go Owen Ruddy a freshman from Virginia Beach hit a crossing pass inches away from Monarch players in front of the net.



Seconds later Eli Carr took a shot that landed on the side of the net – a foot or so short more to the right and it might have gone into the goal.



Doumbia kept ODU in the game by a leaping save of a high shot with 20 minutes left that he knocked it just over the net and then stuffed a shot from Milo Yosef right in front of the net with 9 minutes to go.



""We're very disappointed"" Dawson said. ""We executed our game plan in an very good manner and we had one letdown"" he said. ""We had our opportunities and when you get opportunities against a team like Marshall you've got to take advantage.""



Dawson said he could not fault his team's effort.



""We played very hard"" he said. ""I feel sorry for the team because we put a lot of effort out there today and left it on the pitch.""



ODU next plays at Charlotte Saturday at 7 p.m. The Monarchs host Kentucky in a Conference USA game Saturday Oct. 15 at 7 p.m.



""We talked right after the game to them and told them we have to keep fighting you can't out your heads down or start pointing fingers"" he said. ""We've got a good young team a very good young team.



""I don't think we're a 2-5-1 team. But that's what the record says and we've got to go out and change that.""

He joins Ira Errett Rodgers (21) Sam Huff (75) and Bruce Bosley (77) as current retired numbers showcased in the north end zone. Major Harris will have his No. 9 retired later this season during the Oklahoma State game Nov. 6.

Talley played for the Mountaineers from 1978-82 helping bring in a new era moving from Old Mountaineer Field to the new stadium in 1980 as well as helping coach Don Nehlen at the start of his tenure.

“The ’77 ’78 and ’79 classes were the three years I think actually turned West Virginia into West Virginia and those guys we all put it on the line for each other and did what we had to do for each other” Talley said.

He totaled 282 tackles 202 assisted tackles 28 tackles for loss and 19 sacks in his career eventually being drafted No. 39 overall to the Buffalo Bills where he had a 12-year NFL stint before ending his career with the Atlanta Falcons and Minnesota Vikings.

Known as a hard-nosed linebacker Talley was an all-pro twice and was also named to two Pro Bowls. He played in four Super Bowls though he never got the win.

He was inducted into the WVU Sports Hall of Fame in 1996 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2011.

“I’m just truly happy that I finally got to the summit of what it is in college and that’s what I consider this to be — the highest honor you can get” Talley said. “And I’m just very proud of it.”

Current defensive lineman Akheem Mesidor wears No. 90 and will finish out his career with it which head coach Neal Brown said is a stellar coincidence.

“I think its fitting that a guy that’s playing at an extremely high level will be the last one to wear 90 here” Brown said. “Akheem is wearing it now and he’ll continue to wear it as he finishes up his career. I think Darryl would be pretty proud of how Akheem has played in that number so far this year.”

Wright’s decision

On the Mountaineers’ final drive with 18 seconds left after Texas Tech took a 23-20 lead returner Winston Wright who had several long returns this season including a touchdown vs. Long Island took a knee at the 11-yard line.

In appeared to be an odd decision considering Wright’s ability but Brown said there is a method to the madness.

“You don’t want to return that when it’s on the ground. Once it’s squibbed you don’t have a really good chance to get it any further than the 30” Brown said. “You take a knee there to save time. That’s the thought process it’s a good play. You all can argue with me on other things but that’s a good play.”

The account will be run by an integrated WPP team with Wavemaker at the core. Beiersdorf will continue to work with incumbents Wavemaker Omnicom's OMD and Dentsu's Carat to plan and buy media in regional and local markets and coordiante strategies globally the company confirmed.

WPP will run communications strategy out of Beiersdorf's headquarters in Hamburg Germany to enable a ""stronger focus on embedding communication centricity"" Beiersdorf said in a statement.

""The assignment does not affect our local cooperation with our three media agencies which are responsible for Beiersdorf’s entire media volume via their respective local assignments"" a Beiersdorf spokesperson said.

Beiersdorf spends $500 million on media as tracked per COMvergence.

The pitch which lasted three months included Publicis Groupe WPP and Dentsu with a final round between Publicis and WPP according to sources.

In 2019 Publicis Groupe won the creative account for Nivea with a bespoke cross-discipline team called One Touch. One Touch will continue to run creative for Nivea according to sources. WPP won creative duties for Beiersdorf brands Eucerin and Hansaplast during the same pitch.

Prior to One Touch Nivea worked with Interpublic Group’s FCB until June of 2019 until allegations of a homophobic comment made on a call led to the demise of their relationship.

For Publicis the Beiersdorf comms strategy win would have clinched more of the business under the holding company’s roof in line with its Power of One strategy. Publicis Groupe recently lost the integrated Mercedes-Benz account which it ran under a bespoke team called Publicis Emil to Omnicom. However it picked up the Planet Fitness account with a custom group called Team Lift.

Beiersdorf has bounced back from the pandemic with revenues up 16.2% year over year to €3.9 billion ($4.5 billion) in Q3.

Publicis and WPP declined to comment.

According to the annual media agency rankings from RECMA a French research company that evaluates media agencies worldwide the top eleven media agencies in Pakistan are losing money year on year.

Featuring data on media agency revenues media agency headcount the ratio between earnings and number of employees and the share of revenues coming from nontraditional – digital and social – media the report shows a harrowing decline in advertising expenditure (AdEx) that all members of the Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) depend on.

In no particular order the top eleven media agencies in Pakistan profiled by RECMA are:

WPP’s Mindshare Wavemaker and Mediacom

Publicis affiliates Brainchild Communications Pakistan ( BCP) Blitz Advertising and Adcom Media

Omnicom affiliates Manhattan and Orient Communications

Dentsu affiliate Synchronise Carat

Havas Media affiliate Media Axis

Per RECMA the top five media agencies in 2017 and 2018 were ordered as Mindshare Starcom & MediaVest affiliate BCP Maxus OMD affiliate Manhattan and Spark affiliate Blitz Advertising. The research company reported that in 2019 the top five media agencies were BCP Mindshare Wavemaker Manhattan and Blitz Advertising. In 2020 this changed to BCP Mindshare Wavemaker Blitz Advertising and Adcom Media.

“Brainchild [grew] by 22%” said the 2020 RECMA media agency ranking report. “Activity is boosted by the organic increase of key existing clients (P&G Mondelez Friesland Campina and China Mobile) coupled with additional businesses in 2020 (Telenor GSM Easy Paisa Lotte Kolson and ARY Laguna).”

After over a decade at the very top from an individual agency rankings perspective Mindshare was dethroned by affiliate agencies under the Publicis Groupe. That said when considering revenues as a group – i.e. WPP vs Publicis vs Omnicom vs Dentsu vs Havas – the media agencies under WPP still come out on top even in the 2020 report.

When measured as a group WPP’s Mindshare Wavemaker and Mediacom are estimated to hold the market share leadership at 42.3% while Publicis affiliates BCP and Blitz Advertising under Z2C Limited only hold 37.5% market share.

“The group ranking is unchanged with GroupM at the top challenged by Brainchild” said the report. “Mindshare Wavemaker and Mediacom grew by an estimated 5% each.”

In a pure WPP and Publicis faceoff the latter comes out on top due to Adcom Media controlling 5.9% of the market bringing the Publicis market share to 43.4% and comparing three versus three media agencies.

In terms of growth rate the 2020 RECMA media agency ranking found that



Zenith affiliated Adcom Media grew by 26%

Starcom affiliated Brainchild grew by 22%

PHD affiliated Manhattan grew by 13%

Spark affiliated Blitz Advertising grew by 8%

There were of course those agencies that shrunk as well with Pakistan Broadcasters Association data on their clients’ list showing an inability to win as many new clients – possibly due to lacking relative media muscle sought by advertisers that commoditize media – including troubles with client retention and a focus on client categories that are historically suspended:

OMD affiliated Manhattan shrunk by 48%

Carat affiliated Synergy Dentsu shrunk by 23%

Havas affiliated Media Axis shrunk by 18%

And UM affiliated Orient Communications shrunk by 17%.

The $20 million Nestle media review will drastically change all of the above in the 2021 report from RECMA given that it makes up 40% of Wavemakers’ 2020 revenue and 11.6% of the overall 2020 revenue of GroupM which is still the market leader in Pakistan in terms of revenue and headcount.

Usurping a market leader while losing money #FunnyAndSad

The RECMA reports show that the combined earnings of all eleven agencies equaled $478 million in 2017 $397 million in 2018 $395 million in 2019 and $407 million in 2020. As reported numerous times by Profit the existence of self-serve advertising tools the nationwide trend of media in-housing the proliferation of influencer marketing ecosystems and the lowered barriers to entry for media buying mean that less than 25% of the $2 billion of the 2021 media and advertising industry in Pakistan is covered by media agencies.

It’s also worth noting that there are more than eleven agencies in Pakistan with media wings the bulk of which did not make the RECMA ranking such as The Brand Partnership Spectrum Communications the infamous Midas Pvt Ltd the rapidly growing Oktopus 360 Media former Maxus MD’s IG Square M&C Saatchi World Services and Wings Media to name a few.

According to the Pakistan Media Outlook 2021 report from Brainchild Communications Pakistan (BCP) AdEx in Q2 2020 declined sharply by 27% than Q2 2019 due to the pandemic induced recession. According to the report AdEx in 2021 is expected to outgrow previous years following normalization in Q3 2020 which was quantified by a 12% growth in AdEx directed at the TV inventory through Q4 2020.

Data from the annual Global Advertising Forecast (GAF) by Magna Global shows that linear and digital ad spend both grew by high-single digits to double-digits from 2013 until 2018 in Pakistan which was plagued with economic and political uncertainty.

“The Pakistani rupee depreciated by over -30% amidst a growing current account deficit and the media industry was hit hard by spending cuts from many major TV spending verticals including CPG/FMCG and communications” said Michelle Bovee Stange an associate director of Global Market Intelligence at Magna Global who studied the Pakistan media landscape for the GAF. “2019 saw a return to stability for the Pakistani economy and the advertising market bolstered by cyclical events like the 2019 Cricket World Cup.”

As reported by Profit when Pakistan went into COVID lockdown on the 24th of March 2020 the linear AdEx decline was relatively modest compared to many other APAC markets. The GAF suggests that AdEx declined in Pakistan by 6% in 2020 with cinema seeing the steepest decline of 15% from a very low base; OOH declined by 10% and television and radio declined by 5%. Analysis by GAF suggests that digital spend slowed significantly but still saw double-digit growth of 18% bringing total net digital ad revenues to $15 million—just 18% of total net advertising revenue.

“Digital video (+28%) and social (+23%) are the engines of growth followed by search (+11%) and finally display (+4%). 2021 should bring recovery for most media formats including radio (+3%) OOH (+4%) and magazines (+1%)” said Bovee Stange. “Television will see continued erosion -2% while digital will accelerate (+21%). Growth will continue in 2022 supported by improving macroeconomic fundamentals (real GDP: +4% following growth of +1% in 2021).”

If this is the case why are media investment companies such as GroupM and Z2C coughing up significant amounts of upfront revenue commitments towards sports such as the rating funeral that is the ICC games and motorsports for the elite? And aside from these 15 ways of stealing from marketers how are media agencies staying afloat – and getting fancier offices – when AdEx is on a decline?

The answer appears to reside with the race to become the largest and specialized sports marketing agency since pushing advertisers towards music platforms is proving to be a losing battle amid market saturation and the death of music channels in Pakistan. The leading example of a sports marketing agency in Pakistan is Blitz Advertising the only full-service agency to make the necessary upfront guarantees to the Pakistan Cricket Board which led to six seasons of the Pakistan Super League from 2016 to 2021.

As of October 2021 Blitz Advertising holds broadcast media rights for the Lanka Premier League Kashmir Premier League Pakistan Celebrity League (CLL) along with contracts with the Pakistan Hockey Federation Pakistan Volleyball Federation (PVF) and the Pakistan Kabaddi Federation (PKF). The full-service agency jointly holds rights for the CLL PVF and PKF games with the Trans Group.

There is a direct correlation between Blitz Advertising investing in securing media rights for mainstream and niche sports events and in its rise to the top five slots of the annual media agency rankings from RECMA. This appears to be the same strategy mirrored by both GroupM Pakistan and BCP.

Direct or indirect sports content ownership deep vertical integration and the drive towards owning influencer marketing ecosystems appear to be the survival strategy of the Big Three. For the remaining eight ignorance is bliss.

How are broadcasters reacting to this?

One would think that members of the Pakistan Broadcasters Association would be alarmed at the decline in AdEx year-on-year and perhaps attempt to maintain a semblance of relevance.

In an attempt to capture more of the AdEx pie ARY Digital Network has followed through on our last story by securing a license for A Sports its first sports-focused channel in the lead-up to broadcast the ICC games. It has also awarded exclusive live digital streaming rights to Daraz for its app with the Alibaba-owned marketplace capitalizing on the subsequent app downloads and promising no interruptions in the form of ads.

This could just refer to the absence of digital video commercials (DVCs) of advertisers that don’t stock products with Daraz while Profit speculates that ads for contextually relevant products – perhaps cricket merchandise – may still pop up while app users attempt to watch the ICC games.

This week advertisers and agencies received a proposal from ARY Digital Network for packages around sponsoring the 2021 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. The packages are categorized into six types of sponsors namely presenting main associate support exclusive and post-match exclusive features.

Across all six packages the total possible AdEx based on this proposal is Rs. 617.5 million ($3.625 million) of which 40% of profits will go to the GroupM and ARY consortium per their agreement with PTV. As reported by Profit there was no additional clarification sought by PTV to determine how it would safeguard itself from low profit created by exaggerated costs which benefit the consortium. Industry insiders also claim that rules of public procurement (PPRA) were also flouted by PTV while finalising this tri-party deal.

Given that PEMRA has rules to the number of licenses allowed per network the fine team at ARY Digital Network formed a completely new company called Horizon Communications (item 119) to secure a license of the forthcoming sports channel known as A Sports.

The SECP database shows that Horizon Communications is led by a CEO named Irfan Malik who just happens to be the SVP of ARY Films. When asked to comment on the connection between A Sports and ARY Digital Network Malik said that there was no connection between the two. He declined to answer further questions and was even shown visuals for the aforementioned sponsorship proposal which did not prompt a response.

Even If we ignore the proposal from ARY Digital Network for packages around sponsoring the 2021 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup one could have still argued that A Sports has nothing to do with the Pakistani pay television network. They could argue this point by saying Irfan Malik is operating a non-competing channel on his own independently having possibly severed his employment with ARY as a whole. This could very well be the case. But there’s more.

And there was light

The SECP database shows that the directors of Horizon Communications are:

Sabeen Salman – the wife of Salman Iqbal the CEO of ARY Digital Network

Mehak Yaqoob – the wife of Yaqoob Iqbal brother of Salman Iqbal

Tariq Wasi – the head of ops at ARY Digital Network

Muhammad Mohsin – the SVP of human resources at ARY Digital Network

and Ayesha Mehboob whose connection to ARY could not be verified at the time of publishing.

Sources confirmed that it was Irfan Malik that led the bid for the license around A Sports without PEMRA conducting any audit or even considering the possibility of an attempt to circumvent the rules of the media regulator which are framed as a vehicle to avoid monopolization but could very well also be a response to the limited on-air space and slots available on satellite and cable.

According to the amended PEMRA Ordinance 2002: the authority is meant to ensure that undue concentration of media ownership is not created in any city town or area and the country as a whole: Provided that if a licensee owns controls or operates more than one media enterprise he shall not indulge in any practice which may impede fair competition of the level playing field.

Perhaps by placing the new channel under a company owned by spouses the leaders of ARY Digital Network are overcoming this rule: the authority shall ensure that undue concentration of media ownership is not created by virtue of the applicant for a broadcast or CTV operation license already owning or operating as a sole or joint shareholder of any other broadcast or CTV station printed newspaper or magazine.

While this may work on paper there is no way the remaining members of the broadcast industry will stand for this and no one believes that spouses are actually competing with each other instead of colluding behind the scenes. This is Pakistan after all.

“Many paradoxically consider policies of PEMRA to actually be responsible for the unprecedented progress of the media industry in the country which ironically paved the way for the concentration of ownership and the unbridled political influence enjoyed by the owners of media organizations” said Sehar Raothar a seasoned media consultant. “In fact successive Pakistani governments have endeavored to revisit their previous policy vis-à-vis media regulation and licensing of electronic media in the country and an erstwhile inefficient PEMRA has recently been instructed by the government to reconsider a few policy initiatives related to the cross-media ownership and licensing of new television channels.”

She told Profit that the industry as a whole needs to duly explore the relationship between media regulation and concentration of ownership in Pakistan through the lens of the political economy of communication. She concluded that owner-friendly policies of PEMRA and its inefficiency in implementing its mandate have resulted in the concentration of ownership one way or the other which facilitated diagonal growth of a handful of companies that control the airwaves in the Pakistani media industry – whether they do it through nepotism by creating different channels under new ownerships.

“In developing countries such as Pakistan where privatization of electronic media and its regulation are nascent experiences communication regulation grows even more complex” she said. “With the introduction of advanced communication technologies new regulatory challenges emerge that require decision-making and regulatory policies that can best serve the interests of citizens – however loopholes in the PEMRA laws or the lack of fear of consequences for violating these laws are prevalent in the ARY/Horizon case.”

Less than a month ago several media agency leaders considered severing their ties with ARY based on concerns that the Pakistani pay television network would help GroupM steal its clients with undercutting rates. Amid industry pressure this did not come to pass. The deal with PTV was perhaps intended to strengthen GroupM’s chances of retaining the $20 million Nestle media review amid a senior replacement at Wavemaker.

Industry sources confirmed to Profit that the Starcom affiliate BCP has won the account on a local level. The incumbent Nestle media agency Wavemaker will lose 40% of its recurring revenue assuming the RECMA data from 2020 showing the media agency network earned $50 million in that year is correct.

When the watchmen are asleep

“PEMRA has failed to effectively check cross-media ownership and has not been able to exercise its authority to implement an efficient regulatory regime as enshrined in its mandate” said Azmat Rasul a faculty member at the Valdosta State University in a paper titled Regulation and Media Monopoly: A Case Study of Broadcast Regulation in Pakistan. “Prior to the PEMRA era these groups were monopolizing the print media market and the new regulatory body brought novel chances of expansion for these large media corporations.”

The sponsorship proposal for the 2021 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup was floated by ARY Digital Network despite sources at Star Middle East – the audio-visual rights holder for ICC games between 2015 and 2023 – stating that they had not received a bank guarantee from ARY Digital Network which GroupM cannot provide under its compliance rules.

Given that ARY Digital Network agreed to partner with GroupM on the condition of guaranteed business from the world’s largest media investment company it is unclear why the Pakistani pay television network is unable to provide Star Middle East with the bank guarantee.

Media and account managers across the country expressed confusion over the sponsorship proposal for the 2021 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup floated by ARY Digital Network given that there is no MediaLogic data to use to even extrapolate the potential reach and ratings of A Sports – which is yet to go on air.

While Ten Sports does air without a license media and account planners shared that there is MediaLogic data attached to the channel but no multinational client is willing to partake due to the illegal nature of the channel airing.

Meanwhile the ICC official broadcasters list states that only Ten Sports and PTV Sports are the respective satellite and terrestrial channels for Pakistan with no mention of A Sports by ARY Digital Network which makes the proposal from ARY Digital Network for packages around sponsoring the 2021 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup even more perplexing.

The Pakistani pay television network is reportedly working out a deal with the cable lobby to replace a relatively smaller competing network channel with A Sports while attempting to broadcast the channel in the areas suspected of being used by MediaLogic for PeopleMeter data collection.

This suspicion is founded on sources within the cable lobby PTCL and in the latest MediaLogic data showing an unusual spike in ratings for ARY Digital Network channels.

That’s right taking advantage of a legal system where one stay order after the other and a relationship with the powers that be can hold the media regulator back ad nauseam. We went from being told that no new licenses would be awarded by PEMRA to one being arranged in a matter of days.

“In all societies regulation of media organizations and the market has remained a contested area generating heated debates like mass media and other means of communication have traditionally run counter to the interests of elites in democratic societies” said Raothar. “Therefore communication policymaking and regulation have emerged as a challenge of great magnitude in transitional societies such as ours that are witnessing the rapid growth of electronic media. Policymaking in the field of communication is considered to be a measured intervention by the government in the structural designs and business plans of companies offering media and communication services.”",,,,,,

Each of these risks must be addressed but their roots and remedies are entirely different.

Defense and national security

Beginning several decades ago two things transformed the semiconductor industry and have put the defense and aerospace sectors at risk. First semiconductor manufacturers by the dozens abandoned these markets to pursue the higher volumes of commercially-driven consumer applications. Then to more cost-effectively support these higher volumes they transitioned to subcontracted overseas manufacturing mainly in Taiwan and China.

The first issue is as concerning as the second. Simultaneous with the U.S. share of global semiconductor manufacturing dropping from 37% in 1990 to 12% today there has been equally alarming drop in the number of the U.S. companies who design and supply these mission-critical semiconductors.

Industry consolidation accounted for some of the decline. Most of this consolidation has led to a de-emphasis of Department of Defense (DoD) NASA and other government engagements since accretive acquisitions typically result in cuts to these generally peripheral portions of the acquiring company’s business. Microelectronics suppliers were also being lured to more lucrative commercial state-of-the-art (SOTA) opportunities and today the number of semiconductor companies with a meaningful defense sector businesses has shrunk dramatically.

This dearth of suppliers is as much of a risk to the U.S. defense and aerospace sector as the offshoring of so much U.S. semiconductor manufacturing to China and Taiwan which became an even greater concern after he trade war with China began. This was followed by increasing aggression in the South China Sea and Hong Kong and the actions and statements made by the Chinese Communist Party in the early stages of the pandemic. U.S. policy needs to address both the commercial and DoD sector issues by creating an environment that incentivizes private investment for onshore manufacturing – not just of SOTA components but also mission-critical semiconductors.

An important first step is the bi-partisan American Foundries Act and its successful addition in July 2020 as an amendment to the Senate’s Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which also includes provisions of the original bipartisan CHIPS for America Act for semiconductor incentive and R&D programs that was authorized but never funded. Also important is the Endless Frontier Act that was expanded in May 2021 and renamed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA). It includes $52 billion in emergency funding to implement the CHIPS Act and allocates $2 billion to “solely focus on legacy chip production to advance economic and national security interests as these chips are essential to the auto industry the military and other critical industries.” The price tag on the bill at one point ballooned to over $250 billion which has caused it to slow down for further debate prior to being passed in the Senate.

The next step is to change the NDAA language so that it also includes the mission-critical and integration-level semiconductors required for military and aerospace applications. This addition would better support the fragile global supply chain for Pentagon-military and space qualified semiconductor manufacturing applications and integration. This qualification process is substantially more rigorous than that in the commercial sector. For instance devices like field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) used in for onboard satellite payload processing need to be qualified to reliability specifications geared to extremely harsh space environments. The same is true of military and space-qualified discrete semiconductors that are the staples of weapons and space system platforms. In some cases they are 60 years old but still desperately needed by both prime and sub-prime contractors.

Fewer and fewer companies supply these products or are even capable of meeting their qualification requirements which creates the potential for looming capacity and capability constraints. In short the military and aerospace market simply does not have the sales volumes to support the continuing technology investment required to attract suppliers. U.S. policymakers must address the massive resulting gaps that have created today’s shrinking military and aerospace electronics supply chain.

Commercial sector

The commercial sector shortage has continued to worsen and the current order rate is outpacing the capacity that semiconductor companies can bring on board. It is a constraint the industry will likely see through the rest of the year most likely into 2022.

The issues that created this crisis have been brewing for some time dating back to late 2018 and early 2019 when tariffs started to create headwinds for many customers. They could not absorb the tariffs and their end consumers could not bear the prices so demand went down in 2019. And then as things began to improve and supply chains realigned so that products destined for the United States could be built outside of China the industry was hit by the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic through the first half of 2020. It added to the demand slide especially in the automotive industrial and consumer sectors. Everyone stopped buying.

As the slowdown happened companies leaned out inventories and started to idle factories to run less than what they could normally produce. Moving forward through the slowdown manufacturers could not get a demand signal from their customers that provided enough warning to start up manufacturing again. This is problematic for an industry where it takes six months of cycle time from when there is a “go” signal as there was in September 2020 to when factories can be ramped up and/or capital investments can be made to expand capacity and production can begin to return to full force again. The industry has had to catch up from where it was back in late 2019 and early 2020.

Today’s supply issues are exacerbated by manufacturers who compete over the same fab capacity. This can be tracked back to the transition from vertical integration to predominately fabless manufacturing. As fab construction costs skyrocketed many semiconductor companies moved to a “fab-lite” model shifting their resources to chip design. They produced some chips in their own fabs while outsourcing some production to foundries. Some went fabless or they exited the business. Then the 2001 recession hastened an industry contraction which launched a consolidation chapter while also accelerating offshoring. The result has been a much weaker industry ecosystem today that was far more vulnerable to the whipsaw impact of the recent pandemic.

Policy priorities

The commercial sector will continue to see supply and demand imbalances resulting from normal economic cycles. But there are also policy initiatives in the medium to long term that will be important to support a stronger U.S. semiconductor infrastructure including both R&D and manufacturing capability. The biggest issue is the manufacturing side which will likely take at least three years to address once government initiatives are launched. Meanwhile it will likely take at least 6-8 quarters to resolve the commercial shortage not just in automotive but across all end markets.

To ensure availability of microelectronics for U.S. defense aerospace and homeland security needs policymakers need to consider the special circumstances of this increasingly fragile dedicated supply chain. Modifying the NDAA bill to include support specifically for mission-critical and integration-level semiconductor suppliers is a first step toward shoring up a shrinking supplier base so it can continue to provide components that pass the rigorous qualification tests that ensure they can be used in much harsher environments for much longer periods of time than the typical commercial semiconductor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMDMvc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1jaGlwLXNob3J0YWdlLWNvdWxkLWV4dGVuZC10aHJvdWdoLTIwMjItbWFydmVsbC1jZW8uaHRtbNIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzEwLzAzL3NlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItY2hpcC1zaG9ydGFnZS1jb3VsZC1leHRlbmQtdGhyb3VnaC0yMDIyLW1hcnZlbGwtY2VvLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Semiconductor chip shortage could extend through 2022 Marvell CEO says,"The semiconductor chip shortage that is hamstringing the production of products ranging from cars and computers to appliances and toothbrushes will extend into 2022 and potentially beyond that the CEO of semiconductor company Marvell Technology said.

""Right now every single end market for semiconductors is up simultaneously; I've been in this industry 27 years I've never seen that happen"" said Marvell CEO Matt Murphy during a CNBC Technology Executive Council event on Thursday. ""If it stays business as usual and everything's up and to the right this is going to be a very painful period including in 2022 for the duration of the year.""

While several chip producers have announced plans to expand factory capacity Murphy who noted his firm is fabless and works with contract manufacturers on its designs said ""that's not going to kick in until 2023 and 2024 — so there's this painful period.""

That is a more pessimistic view than some of Murphy's chip industry peers who have recently said they expect the shortage to wane next year as new factories open.

""We've always gone through cycles of ups and downs where demand has exceeded supply or vice versa"" AMD CEO Lisa Su said Monday at the Code Conference in Beverly Hills California. ""This time it's different.""

Su said that while she expects the first half of 2022 to be ""likely tight"" the second half will be less severe as manufacturing capacity opens.

""It might take you know 18 to 24 months to put on a new plant and in some cases even longer than that"" Su said. ""These investments were started perhaps a year ago.""

AMD rival Intel is one of the companies that has looked to double down on manufacturing announcing in March that it would invest $20 billion in two new chip factories in Arizona.

TSMC  which is the biggest manufacturer of semiconductors on contract and works with companies including Marvell is also building a $12 billion factory in Arizona. The company announced in April that it would invest $100 billion over the next three years to increase factory capacity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYXV0by5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvZ20tcmVwb3J0cy1iaWctZHJvcC1pbi0zcS11cy1zYWxlcy1vbi1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLXdvZXMvODY3MDk3NTfSAXRodHRwczovL2F1dG8uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9nbS1yZXBvcnRzLWJpZy1kcm9wLWluLTNxLXVzLXNhbGVzLW9uLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3Itd29lcy84NjcwOTc1Nw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM reports big drop in 3Q US sales on semiconductor woes,The No. 1 U.S. automaker has said it will talk on Wednesday about its growth strategy EV and software platform advantages its self-driving vehicle business and the related financial road map as it seeks to draw new investors and a valuation closer to that of EV market leader Tesla Inc.

90% of smartphone industry hit hard by semiconductor shortage: Counterpoint

02 Oct 2021: 90% of smartphone industry hit hard by semiconductor shortage: Counterpoint

Smartphone shipments will see a meager 6% growth in the second half of 2021 down from earlier predictions of 9% due to the ongoing global semiconductor shortage reported industry analysis firm Counterpoint Research. Total units shipped are now expected to grow to 1.41 billion instead of 1.45 billion. Nearly 90% of the smartphone industry—including players like Samsung OPPO and Xiaomi—has been affected said Counterpoint.

Getting worse: Smartphone makers receiving 70% of requested component volumes

Counterpoint noted the shortage was affecting other industries from late 2020 but the smartphone industry was relatively unaffected because of ""advanced planning and order placing."" However some smartphone makers are now getting only 70% of requested volumes on key components—down from 80% in Q2 2021. The smartphone industry was expected to rebound this year despite being hit by the pandemic. That seems unlikely now.

Impact: Samsung OPPO Xiaomi affected; Apple most resilient

Samsung OPPO and Xiaomi have been affected by the shortage of application processors one of the key elements of smartphones. Their demands were not met by application processor vendors like Qualcomm and Mediatek because of the lower yield rates of semiconductor fabrication plants. Apple however is in a good position because it is the ""most resilient"" in the face of the shortage reported Counterpoint.

Reason: Manufacturing complexities behind chip shortage

Chips are used in everything from cars mobiles and gaming devices to refrigerators and microwaves. Chip production involves 200mm or 300mm silicon wafers which are split into many tiny chips. Large wafers are expensive. So there has been an increase in the demand for the small ones. However there is a lack of the 200mm manufacturing equipment reports said causing a chip shortage.

Effects: Companies cancel defer smartphone launches

Samsung has reportedly canceled the launch of its Galaxy S21 FE smartphone and the move was triggered by semiconductor shortages. The launch of JioPhone Next—the 4G smartphone jointly developed by Reliance Jio and Google—has been delayed till Diwali due to concerns over the semiconductor shortage. On the other end smartphone prices are also likely to keep rising due to the global shortage of chips.

ASML (ASML 1.83%) and Intel (INTC -0.80%) are two of the most important semiconductor companies in the world. ASML is the top supplier of photolithography systems which are used to etch circuit patterns into silicon wafers. Intel is the top producer of CPUs for PCs and data centers.

ASML is also the world's only provider of high-end EUV (extreme ultraviolet) systems which are used to manufacture the world's smallest chips. That's why it's a key partner for Intel which owns a small stake in ASML as well as its top foundry competitors TSMC and Samsung.

ASML and Intel both attracted a lot of attention throughout the global chip shortage which started in late 2019 and worsened throughout the pandemic. But over the past three years ASML's stock surged about 300% as Intel's stock rose less than 15%.

ASML benefited from the market's insatiable appetite for new photolithography systems while Intel struggled with ongoing shortages delays and manufacturing issues. Let's take a fresh look at both companies and see if ASML remains a stronger investment than Intel.

ASML continues to fire on all cylinders

ASML's revenue rose just 8% in 2019 as the global glut in memory chips curbed the market's appetite for new systems. However its revenue increased 18% in 2020 as the memory market stabilized and the top foundries boosted their capacity to cope with the surging demand for new chips.

ASML's earnings per share increased just 1% in 2019 but jumped 38% in 2020 as it sold more higher-margin EUV systems. Its total EUV sales rose 60% and accounted for 32% of its full-year revenues.

In the first half of 2021 ASML's revenue rose 45% year over year as its EPS soared 110%. Analysts expect its full-year revenue and earnings to grow 35% and 58% respectively as TSMC Samsung and Intel install more EUV systems. All three foundries are spending billions of dollars on building new plants and a lot of that money will flow to ASML.

Next year analysts expect ASML's revenue and earnings to increase 15% and 22% respectively. Its growth will likely decelerate as the chip shortage ends but its business should keep expanding over the long term as it rolls out its next generation of high-NA EUV systems -- which will be used to manufacture chips that are even smaller than today's tiniest chips.

Intel prepares for a painful turnaround

Intel's revenue grew just 2% in 2019 but rose 8% in 2020 as it shipped more PC and data center chips throughout the pandemic. The shift to remote work boosted demand for new PCs while the heavier usage of online services forced data centers to upgrade their hardware.

Intel's adjusted EPS rose 6% in 2019 and grew 9% in 2020. However it boosted its EPS with billions of dollars in buybacks throughout both years instead of allocating that cash toward improving its R&D and manufacturing capabilities. That trend worried investors since Intel had already fallen behind TSMC and Samsung in the ""process race"" to create smaller and more advanced chips.

In the first half of 2021 Intel's revenue dipped 1% year over year as its EPS fell 18%. Those declines can be attributed to its market-share losses to AMD (AMD -0.31%) in the PC and data center markets as well as tough comparisons to the pandemic's initial impact a year ago.

Analysts expect Intel's revenue and earnings to decline 6% and 10% respectively this year. Intel's new CEO Pat Gelsinger who took the helm in February plans to aggressively expand Intel's manufacturing plants to reclaim the process lead from TSMC by 2025. That's an ambitious goal but there's no guarantee that it will succeed and reverse its market losses to AMD -- which currently outsources the production of its chips to TSMC's superior foundries.

The obvious winner: ASML

ASML trades at 47 times forward earnings while Intel has a much lower forward P/E ratio of 11. However ASML's near-monopoly in photolithography systems its role as a linchpin of the global semiconductor market and its robust growth rates all justify that higher valuation. Meanwhile Intel's stock deserves a lower valuation because it faces a grueling uphill battle against TSMC and AMD.

Intel's downside potential could be limited at these levels but ASML has a lot more upside potential -- especially as the global chip shortage drags on and highlights the importance of its EUV systems."

Hyderabad: For most of the day Giridhar Sripathi is a data scientist at Oracle Corporation in the city. In between he can be seen studying for a part-time PhD from National Institute of Technology Jamshedpur in Artificial Intelligence. And in his free time Sripathi is a numismatist whose collection according to him has over 2800 ancient coins spanning various rulers dynasties and kingdoms.

“When I was a teenager my grandmother gave me my first Victoria silver coin which belonged to East India Company and since then I developed the hobby of collecting coins” he says.

From that gifted coin the collection grew as Sripathi added early medieval period coins (500 – 1300 AD) late medieval period coins (1300 – 1700 AD) Mughal era coins (1526–1761) Mysore Kingdom coins Indian Princely States coins and so on all in gold silver and copper.

“We know very few Mughal rulers like Babur Humayun Shah Jahan and Akbar. But there are nearly 26 rulers in the dynasty. Previously whenever the ruler changed the coins would change accordingly with the ruler’s picture printed on it. Out of 26 rulers I managed to collect those of 24. The price of the remaining two coins goes into lakhs and is out of my budget” he says.

Sripathi who is also a member of the Rashtriya Mudra Parishad and the Indian Coins and Currency Group says “These groups exchange coins. I also save my salary to buy these coins from exhibitions and auctions across the country.”

He reaches out to the historians and other coin collectors who help him differentiate between fake and real coins. At present he is focusing on collecting Janapadas and Mahajanapadas known as Vedic period coins on the Indian subcontinent which are too rare and expensive.

“It’s very difficult to get the collection of Janapadas and Mahajanapadas as they date back to the 6th century BC. They are handmade too. Unlike other coins they have the elements of nature like water sun trees fire etc. and they are not round in shape like other coins” he points out.

The Miyapur resident is willing to display and explain about the coins to school children. Those interested can contact him over Ph. No. 95507 12233.

Who doesn’t? As of September 2021 there are reportedly 2755 billionaires on Earth with an approximated cumulative net value of $13.1 trillion. Of this amount the top 10 wealthiest people in the world account for $1153 billion or approximately 8.8 percent which is remarkable when you consider that they represent around 0.36 percent of the total billionaires. According to the Forbes World’s Billionaires List here are the 10 people currently estimated as the wealthiest as of September 2021.

1. Jeff Bezos Richest Person in the World

Age: 57

Residence: Seattle US

Founder and Executive Chair: Amazon

Net Worth: $177 billion

Amazon Ownership Stake: 11 percent ($178 billion)

Other Assets: The Washington Post ($250 million personal assets) Blue Origin ($7.15 billion private investments) and $13.4 billion in cash

Jeff Bezos in 1994 founded Amazon.com in a garage in Seattle soon after he quit from the hedge fund company D.E. Shaw. In fact he had initially started with the idea of an online bookstore to his former boss David E. Shaw who wasn’t interested.

Although Amazon.com primarily started by selling books it has since modified into a one-stop shop for almost everything under the sun and is considered the world’s largest retailer. At any time it is hard to contradict its self-description as the “Earth’s most customer-centric company.” Its pattern of constant modification is apparent in some of its stunning expansions including procuring Whole Foods in 2017 and starting its own branded over-the-counter drugs in August 2017.

In 2020 Amazon’s stock price skyrocketed on the intensified demand for online shopping as lockdowns urged people to stay home. On July 5 2021 Bezos stepped down as the CEO of the e-commerce company and shifted to his new role as its executive chairman.

Bezos for the first time took Amazon public in 1997 and became the first man since Bill Gates in 1999 to obtain a net worth of more than $100 billion. Bezos’s other successful projects are as follows:

Aerospace company Blue Origin.

The Washington Post which he purchased in 2013.

The 10000-year clock also known as the Long Now.

On July 20 2021 Bezos with his brother Mark aviation pioneer Wally Funk and Dutch student Oliver Daemen finished Blue Origin’s first successful crewed flight reaching an altitude of just above 62 miles before landing safely.

A part of the proceeds from this effort was then reinvested to create X.com an online payment system that later became PayPal. While both of these companies were eventually sold to other firms Musk has continued his status as the CEO and lead designer of his third project Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) which targets to make space exploration more affordable.

In 2004 Musk became a significant investor of Tesla Motors (now Tesla) which led to him being declared the co-founder and his current position as the CEO of the electric vehicle firm. In addition to its line of electric automobiles including sedans sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and the popular “Cybertruck” announced in 2019 Tesla also manufactures energy storage devices automobile accessories merchandise and through its takeover of SolarCity in 2016 solar power systems.

In 2016 Musk established two more companies Neuralink and The Boring Company serving as the CEO of Neuralink. Neuralink develops brain-machine interface devices to help individuals with paralysis and potentially allow users to interact with their computers and mobile devices mentally.

His shares in Christian Dior SE also an additional 6.2 percent in LVMH are held within his family-owned holding company Groupe Arnault SE.

Arnault remained Férinel’s chairman for another six years until he procured and reorganized luxury goods maker Financière Agache in 1984 ultimately selling all of its holdings other than Christian Dior and Le Bon Marché.

The most famous living value investor Warren Buffett filed his first tax return in 1944 at age 14 declaring his earnings from his boyhood paper route.

Popularly known as the “Oracle of Omaha” Buffett made the bulk of his fortune through purchasing shares in companies with easy-to-understand business operations. While many investors have been gathering into tech companies Buffett has opted for a more careful approach only buying from well-established companies that are easier to understand such as IBM and Apple. He is also a noted Bitcoin agnostic. Additionally Buffett has also entirely purchased a lengthy list of companies over the years including Dairy Queen Duracell GEICO and Kraft Heinz.

Outside of investing Buffett has donated much of his wealth toward humanitarian efforts.

Three years following Ellison joined Precision Instruments serving as the company’s vice president of research and development.

By 1977 Ellison had established Software Development Laboratories (SDL) along with Oates and Miner which two years later released Oracle the first commercial relational database program to utilize Structured Query Language. The database program proved so popular that SDL would change its name to Oracle Systems Corporation in 1982. Additionally Ellison joined Tesla’s board in December 2018.

Oracle is the second-largest software company and provides a wide variety of cloud computing programs and other software such as Java and Linux and the Oracle Exadata computing platform.

Age: 48

Residence: Palo Alto California

Co-founder and Board Member: Alphabet

Net Worth: $91.5 billion1

Alphabet Ownership Stake: 6 percent ($115 billion total)

Other Assets: $13.8 billion in cash

Like several tech billionaires on this list Larry Page’s claim to fame got its start in a college dorm room. While attending Stanford University in 1995 Page and his friend Sergey Brin came up with the idea of improving data extraction capabilities while accessing the Internet. The duo invented a new type of search engine technology they dubbed “Backrub” named after its ability to analyze “backing links.” From there Page and Brin went on to found Google in 1998 with the former serving as CEO of the company until he stepped down in 2001.

Google is one of the largest Internet search engines on the planet accounting for more than 70 percent of global online search requests. In 2006 Google (the company) expanded by acquiring YouTube the biggest platform for user-submitted videos. Then 2008 saw the release of the first mobile phone utilizing the Android operating system which Android Inc. originally developed prior to Google acquiring the company in 2005. Today Google is a subsidiary of Alphabet a holding company for which Page served as CEO from 2015 to 2019.

Page is also a founding investor of Planetary Resources a space exploration and asteroid-mining company. Initially established in 2009 the firm was acquired by blockchain firm ConsenSys in 2018 amid funding problems. He has also shown an interest in “flying car” companies having invested in Kitty Hawk and Opener.

9. Sergey Brin

Age: 48

Residence: Los Altos California

Co-founder and Board Member: Alphabet

Net Worth: $89 billion

Alphabet Ownership Stake: 5 percent ($110.1 billion total)

Other Assets: $13.9 billion in cash

Compared to the other companies featured on this list what makes Google unique is that its co-founders are relatively close in terms of total wealth. Sergey Brin’s engagement in Google follows a similar path to Page’s. After the duo founded the company in 1998 Brin served as co-president alongside Page until Eric Schmidt took over as CEO in 2001. Similarly after establishing Alphabet in 2015 Brin acted as the holding company’s president before stepping down in 2019 when Sundar Pichai took over as CEO.

In addition to being a top-rated search engine Google also offers a suite of online tools and services known as Google Workspace which includes Gmail Google Drive Google Calendar Google Meet Google Chat Google Docs Google Sheets Google Slides and more. In addition to software Google also deals in various electronic devices including its Pixel smartphones its Pixelbook computers and tablets its Nest smart home devices and its Stadia gaming platform.

Brin spent much of 2019 focusing on X Alphabet’s “moonshot” research laboratory responsible for innovative technologies like the Waymo self-driving cars and Google Glass smart glasses. He has also donated millions of dollars toward researching a cure for Parkinson’s and partnered with The Michael J. Fox Foundation to devise new drugs against LRRK2 one of the most significant genetic contributors to the disease.

10. Mukesh Ambani

Age: 64

Residence: Mumbai India

Chair and Managing Director: Reliance Industries

Net Worth: $84.5 billion

Reliance Industries Ownership Stake: 42 percent ($86.09 billion total)

Other Assets: Mumbai residential property ($410 million private assets) and $975 million in cash

Reliance Industries was initially founded as a small textile manufacturer by Dhirubhai Ambani in 1966. In 1979 Dhirubhai’s son Mukesh moved to Palo Alto California to attend Stanford Business School. A year later Mukesh returned home at his father’s command to oversee the construction of a new polyester mill during which time he also joined Reliance Industries’ board. Rather than moving back to the U.S. to finish his university program Mukesh remained in India to lead Reliance’s backward integration initiative. During the 1990s he initiated the company’s efforts to create and acquire multiple petrochemical plants and petroleum refineries.

In 2002 Dhirubhai suffered a stroke and passed away. The lack of a will resulted in a feud between Mukesh and his brother Anil over how their father’s empire would be distributed. Three years later due to a settlement brokered by their mother the siblings agreed to split the business with Mukesh retaining control over refining petrochemicals oil and gas and textile operations. This didn’t entirely ease the tension between the two brothers as they would neither settle a legal dispute over sharing natural gas nor dissolve their non-compete agreements until 2010.

In 2013 Mukesh and Anil seemingly buried the hatchet with the announcement of a $220 million pact to share a fiber-optic network between their two companies.

Reliance Industries has founded several highly successful subsidiaries under Mukesh’s leadership including Reliance Retail and telecommunications company Jio. He is also a member of The Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum an elected Foreign Member of the United States National Academy of Engineering a member of the Global Advisory Council of Bank of America and a member of the International Advisory Council of The Brookings Institution.

Key takeaway

If you want to get a little nearer to be among Forbe’s richest billionaires list you might need to become a technological innovator or a retail king. Or you can keep it simple and target on value investing. It also wouldn’t hurt to start by coming from wealth as Arnault Ambani and some other super-wealthy individuals did; think Jim Walton (#18 on Forbes’ list) and Charles Koch (#27). However the most exceptional fortunes on this decorated list started off as great ideas from people with the drive creativity and connections to make them take off."

Cisco relies on the hundreds of resellers in its partner program to win contracts with tens of thousands of clients globally ranging from large enterprises to small businesses. All told Cisco's partners account for 90% of the company's bookings which totalled $49.8 billion in the company's most recent fiscal year.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Insider has compiled a list of Cisco's most important partners as it aims to drive more revenue from software and subscriptions. The list which you can read in full below was drawn from Wall Street analysts conversations with Cisco executives and the company's previous public statements.

These companies handle some of Cisco's largest contracts and are leading the charge in its business transformation. Notably they span from tech titans like Amazon Web Services which has emerged as one of Cisco's most important allies down to relatively lower-profile firms like UK-based Logicalis which has been working with the firm over the better part of the last three decades.

Cisco is now leaning on its partners to spearhead the company's push beyond its core infrastructure business into newer lines of business around software and subscriptions. Earlier this year Cisco revamped its partner compensation structure to more heavily reward resellers for closing deals around its subscription-based products that generate recurring revenue.

""Partners enable Cisco to deliver the right business solutions to our customers"" Cisco chief customer and partner officer Gerri Elliot said during the company's investor day last month adding that partners are ""laser focused on continuing to transform how we go to market and continuing to put even more emphasis on driving recurring revenue.""

Analysts also say that the partner network gives Cisco an edge against a rising tide of competition including a crop of startups as well as more established firms like Microsoft Juniper Networks.

""Cisco's biggest competitive advantage is the fact that it has so many feet on the street and the fact that they own the relationship with the biggest channel partners out there"" Jim Fish director and senior research analyst at Piper Sandler told Insider.

Watching all of your favorite shows in one easy to navigate software solution is definitely easier to do now than it's ever been but that doesn't mean there aren't some sticking points here and there to ruin your binge-watching experience.

For instance some streaming companies will only air certain episodes at specific times. Other services only have specific seasons of a show with folks left twiddling their thumbs and watching other series in the interim (or torrenting them) until they become available. Some FBI fans signed up for Paramount Plus and wanted to know if all of the show's episodes are on the platform. We have good news for them!

Is 'FBI' on Paramount Plus?

ViacomCBS' own streaming service Paramount Plus combined with Showtime has managed to secure a whopping 42 million global subscribers. Many of those subscribers are due to the new platform quickly bolstering its offerings with a slew of popular series and movies. However due to the Viacom/CBS merger the content that ultimately gets selected for Paramount Plus isn't always what you'd expect (unlike it might be with other services such as Disney Plus).

That's mainly because the Mouse seemingly rules things with an iron fist. For the most part if Disney owns it then it's headed to their streaming platform. Obviously Marvel's Netflix properties complicate the matter somewhat and there are even reports of a Season 4 of Daredevil reportedly being developed for Disney with no word of what's happening to Seasons 1-3. This means that separate seasons of the show can exist on separate streaming platforms and FBI initially experienced a similar fate.

At first the FBI franchise's deal with Paramount Plus was a limited one. You would figure since Viacom and CBS are one in the same that there wouldn't be any impediment to getting the show on Paramount Plus then right? Well it's a little more complicated than that. The popular CBS crime drama is a joint venture between CBS and Universal Television.

Universal is owned by NBC so the initial deal for FBI on the streaming platform left out the first three seasons of the show. Now every season of FBI will be available for Paramount Plus customers to watch to their hearts' content but fans still have some questions.

Are 'FBI' spin-offs like 'International' going to appear on Paramount Plus as well?

If you head over to Paramount Plus you'll see that FBI: Most Wanted's third season is available to stream but not earlier episodes. FBI: International just debuted in 2021 and the first three episodes of the show are also featured on Paramount Plus so it looks like if that series gets greenlit for more seasons then they'll all find a home on Paramount Plus.

On Saturday the couple released a joint statement on their respective social media handles confirming their separation. “After much deliberation and thought Chay and I have decided to part ways as husband and wife to pursue our own paths. We are fortunate to have a friendship of over a decade that was the very core of our relationship which we believe will always hold a special bond between us. We request our fans well-wishers and the media to support us during this difficult time and give us the privacy we need to move on” wrote Samantha.

The couple's heart-breaking announcement has shocked their fans and colleagues alike. While several celebs including Khushbu and Kangana reacted to the statement it is actor Siddharth's tweet that is grabbing the eyeballs of many. The actor who was earlier in a relationship with Samantha penned a cryptic post hours after she announced her separation. ""One of the first lessons I learnt from a teacher in school...""Cheaters never prosper."" What's yours?"" He tweeted. Several netizens reacted to the actor's tweet and asked if he was referring to his rumoured former lover Samantha. Reportedly Siddharth and Samantha were in a relationship for over two-and-half-years before they broke up in 2015.

After a few years of dating Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Naga Chaitanya who worked together in several movies got married in 2017. Rumors of their break-up began doing the rounds after the actress dropped the Akkineni surname from her social media accounts and changed into ‘S’.

Peter Thiel is such a person and the strength of the field that surrounds him is so intense that it is difficult to believe anything that anyone writes about him.

So you approach journalist Max Chafkin’s book with a degree of scepticism. Has he succeeded in penetrating the hype of the “Thielverse” and drilled down to the heart of the riddle wrapped around an enigma that is Thiel? The answer is: perhaps. And if he has succeeded then the conclusion is that Thiel is nothing like as interesting as the media (and the political world) seem to think. He’s just a very rich and very strange human being.

He was born in 1967 in Frankfurt to pious Christian parents and came to the US as a one-year-old. His father was a mining expert and took the family to apartheid South Africa for a few years before returning to the US and settling in California. At school Thiel was a classic nerd and a formidable chess player (one of the best under-13 chess players in the US apparently). But even then he was perceived as “inscrutable distant and haughty”. Fifty years on he’s much the same.

In the Thielverse young rightwing single males worship their hero as someone gifted with godlike prescience and wisdom

Thiel then went to Stanford which he hated. What particularly infuriated him was the university’s supposedly liberal politically correct ethos and it led him to found the Stanford Review a scabrously neo-reactionary little journal designed to troll liberals and their detested values. In it one finds the seeds of Thiel’s victim mentality not at that stage as a gay man (that came later) but as a white conservative non-PC male.

Despite that though he stayed on at Stanford’s law school before leaving to embark on what looked like a standard legal career. While labouring in that arid wasteland he co-authored a book The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and Political Intolerance on Campus which brought him to the attention of the most poisonous segments of American conservatism and in a way launched him on the contrarian track that has since defined his life.

Abandoning his legal career he tried to use his growing political notoriety to set up a hedge fund. It didn’t work. But then he ran into Max Levchin who had an idea for software that would enable personal computers to communicate with banks’ mainframe systems. The idea was to use digital IOUs instead of dollars to buy stuff.

It was the idea that launched PayPal which grew rapidly because eBay users liked it and was the start of Thiel’s rise to billionaire-hood even though it lost money hand over fist and was rescued from insolvency by a “merger” with a similar outfit founded by Elon Musk. The company’s early employees and investors became what the media came to call “the PayPal mafia” because they have parlayed their windfall profits into a number of other successful tech companies (with Thiel taking a cut nearly every time). They have also provided their hero with a cadre of devoted followers who have helpfully burnished his myth as he climbed the greasy pole to his current obscene wealth.

Chafkin is a terrific journalist and he has provided a detailed impeccably researched account of this journey. In a way The Contrarian is a chronicle of the evolution of a weird personality cult: the Thielverse whose members overwhelmingly young rightwing single males worship their hero as someone gifted with godlike prescience and wisdom.

The strange thing is that the record doesn’t really support this hagiographical vision. Thiel isn’t a gifted geek just someone who is good at spotting an opportunity. His investment record is patchy although it shows that he has always been good at getting out before the peak. And although he masquerades as a visionary who derides liberal democracy as too slow and stupid to survive in practice he has devoted much of his career to building businesses that feed off its governments. In that sense his actual legacy is Palantir a supposedly omnipotent and omniscient corporation that can do magic with data analytics; in fact it is a humdrum government contractor like the rest of the aerospace and global consultancy firms. Think of it as Accenture with added halitosis.

The most interesting thought that emerges from Chafkin’s book is that Thiel isn’t really a visionary at all. That’s because he’s defined only by what he’s against – liberal democracy liberal elites multiculturalism and so on. But if you ask what is he for then only one answer can be extracted from this book: he’s for Peter Thiel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvdGhlLWNvbnRyYXJpYW4tcGV0ZXItdGhpZWwtc2lsaWNvbi12YWxsZXktcHVyc3VpdC1vZi1wb3dlci1yZXZpZXctZG9uYWxkLXRydW1wLTM1ZHNwNnJia9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Contrarian: Peter Thiel and Silicon Valley's Pursuit of Power review — a liberal-baiting tech-supervillain,"Peter Thiel?

Some online-based groups are laundering a large amount of money from Bangladesh through their ‘e-gift card’ businesses by attracting unsuspecting people mostly the young and adolescents.

These groups are illegally creating e-money under the pretext of virtual gift cards to pay subscription fees for services such as watching movies or boosting content on YouTube and Facebook.

They also help customers transfer money to services like PayPal debit Visa or MasterCard. During this process the operators receive payments in local currency and convert them to US dollars.

These service providers include Daraz.com bd.techtreek.com Ecard.com.bd Gift card bd ecard.com.bd giftcardszonebd.com and gift card house.

They receive money from local customers through mobile financial services (MFS) such as bKash Nagad and Rocket against virtual cards or products and pay the international service providers or companies through illegal channels.

Many people in Bangladesh purchase products from online shopping sites like Amazon Alibaba through virtual PayPal debit Visa or MasterCard. Google Play Apple iTunes Xbox & PlayStation Nintendo Steam and many more gift cards are available in the country.

Several virtual card providers told The Business Post that anyone from Bangladesh could send any amount to a PayPal account and buy anything from an international e-commerce company.

When this reporter posed as a customer and contacted e-gift card store ‘bd.techtreek.com’ owner Zahid Hasan Biswas he told that it is possible to transfer any amount to a PayPal account in the USA from Bangladesh without any extra charge.

“If a customer wants to send money to any country other than the US she/he will have to pay an extra fee. They will have to pay through MFS” Biswas said.

“It’s more like a hundi system.”

Hundi is an illegal money transfer system that deprives the government of tax.

bd.techtreek.com offers gift cards worth $50-100. Zahid said they were not laundering money.

He told The Business Post that they use Payoneer for exchanging any amount above $200 claiming that the service is approved by Bangladesh Bank. “We use gift cards for payments below $50” he said.

Joy Mahmud owner of ‘Gift card bd’ also said that some Bangladeshis living abroad especially in the USA are involved with this transaction system.

Bangladesh Bank’s Executive Director and spokesperson Md Serajul Islam told The Business Post that only banks or financial institutions approved by the central bank can send money aboard and issue MasterCard or Visa Card.

“People should be careful about those who are offering international financial services such as PayPal debit Visa and MasterCard in Bangladesh without BB’s approval” Islam said.

DarazMall a flagship store of Daraz online shopping sells virtual Google play store gift cards. It is trying to woo Bangladeshi customers with a paid campaign on Facebook.

Daraz’s terms and conditions say customers must be over 13 years of age and US residents to avail their services. But anyone from Bangladesh can buy their virtual gift cards by paying through MFS in local currencies.

One of the customers Md Farhad Molla told The Business Post that he bought several gift cards from DarazMall this month. “Anyone can buy virtual gift cards from this platform without hassle” he said.

Daraz declined to comment on the issue.

In Bangladesh financial crime investigators say that young adolescents who play online games on smartphones or electronic devices buy these virtual gift cards.

Bangladeshi merchants who sell goods on e-commerce sites or Facebook and promote video clips on YouTube are using virtual cards to avoid banking system hassle and evade the government’s 15 per cent VAT.

For gift cards Card House is charging Tk 58 against $1 while the current exchange rate is around Tk 85.

Its owner Mohammad Saif said it is part of their strategy to boost business.

‘‘PayPal bitcoin transactions are done in various clandestine ways in Bangladesh. We are getting these facilities” Saif said without elaborating.

Gift Card House located on Khulna’s Belayet Hossain Road sells virtual gift cards with a trade license from the city corporation. They are charging Tk 65 against $1. Its owner Ibrahim Khalil said he had a good stock of gift cards.

“Just buy the gift cards if you need them. Don’t bother about the payment system” he said.

Ecard.com.bd sells ‘Vanilla VISA Gift Card and Vanilla Master Card’ for Facebook or YouTube boosting. The company’s website says it is an easy payment method with ‘instant email delivery’. They have multiple payment options like bKash Rocket Nagad and Bank Transfer and there is no service charge or extra fee on payment.

One of the owners of Ecard told The Business Post that they did not bother to have Bangladesh Bank’s permission to provide financial card services.

Md Mesbaul Haque General Manager of the Payment Systems Department of Bangladesh Bank said all foreign gift card wallet services include Payoneer and lottery are illegal in Bangladesh. The central bank published two public notices between 2019 and 2021 in this regard.

He said BB had sought opinion from the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission. They too said the payment services were illegal in Bangladesh.

Criminal Investigation Department’s Special Police Superintendent for Financial Crime Humayun Kabir said laundering money through virtual transactions is easy. “It’s a kind of hundi” he said.

“We are aware of the online virtual card businesses that are laundering money. Our team is working on the issue” Kabir said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdW5kYXl3b3JsZC5jb20vY3JpbWUvaXJpc2gtY3JpbWUvYW5uZS1jb2xvbWluZXMtZmFtaWx5LXJldmVhbC1hYnVzZS1zaGUtZW5kdXJlZC1mcm9tLW11cmRlcmVyLWh1c2JhbmQvNDA5MTM5NDcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Anne Colomines' family reveal husband Renato Gehlen abused her before murder,"""He killed my daughter after six years of humiliating her""

Murdered PayPal worker Anne Colomines was subjected to six years of abuse by killer husband Renato Gehlen before he took her life by stabbing her in the heart her family have revealed.

They detail how control freak Gehlen who was found guilty of Anne's murder on Wednesday used psychological and verbal abuse to grind the 37-year-old down - making their formerly ""joyful"" daughter and sister ""a little less shiny each year"".

In a heartbreaking interview Anne's mum Danielle told us how just days after Gehlen knelt before her at the couple's 2014 wedding and vowed ""he would protect her all of his life"" friends heard him warn Anne: ""You belong to me now.""

And worse was to come over the course of their three-year-marriage as the Brazilian native:

Would not tolerate his more successful wife wearing make-up heels or dresses;

Constantly derided her as ""fat"" and ""ugly"";

Twisted her by the ear ""to correct her behaviour"";

And said he was ""wasting his life with her"" after the couple learned she would need in vitro fertilisation (IVF) to get pregnant.

""There is nothing more we can do for Anne"" heartbroken mum Danielle (75) said on Friday evening before flying home to France.

""All that is left for us now is to try and warn other women. To tell them if they are in a situation like Anne's are with a partner like him leave now.

""He killed my daughter after six years of humiliating her every day even though he was living at her expense because she was finally going to leave him. He was going to lose her his possession so he wanted to punish her.

""There was nothing but hate in that act.""

Anne Colomines

Danielle and Anne's sister Alexandra sat through the entirety of Gehlen's trial.

During the case graphic details emerged of her murder in the couple's Dorset Square apartment on October 24 2017 as well as the ludicrous excuses Gehlen offered in a vain attempt to escape justice.

Chief State Pathologist Dr Linda Mulligan testified that she found four stab wounds to Anne's torso a 22cm incised wound to her throat and six incisions on her hands consistent with defensive injuries. One of the stab wounds was 20cm deep and passed through the heart causing her death.

Arrested after the murder Gehlen claimed to gardaí that Anne had stabbed herself following a row over her decision to leave him and start a new life with a French boyfriend.

He claimed she fell as they struggled and that she then used the knife to stab herself in the abdomen and in the middle of the chest.

He told detectives that he then tried to kill himself because Anne was his family.

But his ""ridiculous and insulting"" excuses were rejected by the jury which agreed Gehlen had displayed the ""ultimate in toxic masculinity"" by stabbing his wife to death in an effort to control the end of their marriage.

""We knew he was going to smear her"" Danielle said.

""The joyful moment for me during the trial came when I knew that the judge and the jury saw the truth and recognised him for what he was.""

Murderer Renato Gehlen

Danielle and Alexandra told how Anne decided to move to Ireland in January of 2012 following the death of her best friend in a car accident in France.

""Anne was somebody who was so joyful and funny"" Danielle said sadly. ""She studied law had several diplomas and had run her own real estate agency.""

Tragically within an hour of landing in Ireland Anne met the man who would steal her confidence her sense of self-esteem and ultimately her life from her.

""Her friend's boyfriend came to collect her at the airport and Renato was in the car with him"" Danielle said.

Alexandra added: ""And Anne was vulnerable because of the tragedy with her friend - she was looking for someone nice and he came across as warm and caring.""

The couple took part in a civil union in Dublin in 2012 and in September of 2014 they celebrated their marriage in a religious ceremony in Courcoury in France - a stone's throw from Anne's family home in Saintes.

Recalling her daughter's wedding heartbroken Danielle said: ""At the end of the ceremony Renato came to kneel in front of me. He told me that he would always take care of Anne that he would protect her all his life.""

""Those were his words; he would protect her all of his life. I welcomed him as my own child and he betrayed me in the worst way possible.""

Just two days after the ceremony in Courcoury Gehlen exposed his true nature at a dinner with one of Anne's friends.

As Anne and her pal discussed former friends Gehlen angrily told her: ""The past is over - you belong to me now.""

Because Anne and Gehlen were living in Dublin Danielle and Alexandra say it was not until after her murder that they were able to piece together the extent of the abuse he inflicted on her in the following years.

Alexandra said: ""We noticed she was changing the way she dressed and was not as expressive as she once was - but I think she was trying to protect us from knowing about him.

""She mentioned sometimes that he was sulky and that he wouldn't speak to her for three or four days but it wasn't until after she died we found out the violent speech.

""He would say things to her like she was fat and ugly that she didn't need make-up because it wouldn't make things any better.

""If they were crossing the road and she strayed off the zebra crossing he would grab her by the ear and twist it like she was a child.""

The abuse only got worse after the couple learned Anne would have to go through IVF to have a child.

This was Alexandra said unbearable for Gehlen who told his wife he was wasting his life with her.

""He was very against her after that"" she said.

In the weeks before Anne's murder the French woman finally told Gehlen she was going to leave him. Anne spent the 14 days before her death in Charente-Maritime - on the south-west coast of France.

On Monday October 23 2017 Anne flew back to Dublin before resuming her work as a senior executive with PayPal. That evening she was stabbed to death by Gehlen.

The jury accepted the prosecution's contention that Gehlen displayed the ""ultimate in toxic masculinity"" by stabbing his wife to death.

Mr Justice Michael MacGrath will hand down the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment on October 22.

""I hope he spends the rest of his life in jail"" said Alexandra. ""Because if he gets out he may well do this to another woman."""

Since stepping down from PepsiCo in 2018 life hasn’t become entirely more relaxed. ‘I wasn’t finished trying to help the world’ she says.

Today she is a director of Philips and she is on the board of Amazon. She also looks after her elderly mother yet still finds time to play tennis takes ballroom dancing lessons and has returned to her favourite childhood sport cricket – she is the only female on the board of the International Cricket Council.

And then there is family time. That second soundtrack is still playing. ‘I’m not a parent who lets my children be. They have to talk to me every day otherwise there’s hell to pay!’ she says clearly relishing her new role as CEO of the Nooyi family.

‘The guilt of not being a full-time mother to my kids in their early years gnawed at me’

In this exclusive extract from her new memoir Indra Nooyi describes the period when she first joined PepsiCo (a decade before she was appointed CEO) and began climbing the greasy pole there while struggling with Mum guilt.

From 1994 to 1999 I worked and worked and worked. I’d go home at night take a shower put on my flannel nightgown to show the girls I wasn’t leaving put them to bed and sit up reading mail and reviewing documents until 1 or 2 a.m. I was almost never around for dinner.

I didn’t exercise. I barely slept.

At least twice a month I was traveling back and forth to our businesses around the world. I went to China at least eight times in this period—including several trips with Henry Kissinger whose firm Kissinger Associates was helping us overseas—to figure out how to invest in a market where Coke had three times Pepsi’s market share.

[I was once asked to go to] Asia for two weeks. We had business meetings from Monday to Thursday and spent long weekends bonding with local executives. I wanted to be home with my family. I did not stop.

My own work responsibilities were huge but I felt compelled to make sure everyone else’s work was up to par too. I coached and mentored and I reviewed and rewrote presentations for dozens of colleagues.

Of all the times I overdid it one day still stabs at me. Mary Waterman our lovely next-door neighbour died of breast cancer. But I skipped Mary’s funeral because I stayed back at work rewriting slides related to the restaurant spin-off for the board something that was really the responsibility of two others on our team. These men had just dropped the assignment on me saying ‘You do it so well.’

I should have just said no. I have never forgiven myself for prioritising my work that day over my dear friend Mary.

Whatever toll my work life took on my role at home I still had the lifeboat of Raj. He was now a partner at the consulting firm working and travelling like crazy yet a steady source of support. We also had a housekeeper who drove and cooked for us and a nanny and they kept the house running and the children safe.

My mother was spending more time with my sister’s and brother’s families in New York in these years although she was always available to step in to help when needed. Raj’s parents also helped out whenever we asked them to.

Tara started Montessori school before she was two years old and switched to preschool at Sacred Heart when she was three. She was busy and cared for during the day and also often came to PepsiCo in the evenings and hung out on the executive floor running around and chatting with whoever was there. No one seemed to mind. Sometimes she curled up and slept under my desk.

Preetha missed me a lot in these years. She was an adolescent and much of what she saw was a busy stressed-out mother. I was loving and present during difficult times but not really there day-to-day. Her angst was expressed by verbal outbursts and I struggled to cope with them.

Tara was a calmer quieter child who once wrote me a note which I still keep in my desk drawer that lays bare the emotions of these years. On a big sheet of construction paper decorated with flowers and butterflies she begs me to come home. “I will love you again if you would please come home” the note says. In her sweet crooked printing the word please is spelled out seven times.

For many years when I travelled I wrote notes and letters to Preetha and Tara and left them at home to open when I was away. I would grab time whenever possible to compose these missives—at my desk sitting in cars or on planes or at night in a hotel before I went to bed. I was always looking out in airport gift shops for stickers or little toys and knickknacks to include with the envelopes. We ended up with quite a collection of dolls in national dress—from Finland from Japan from Brazil.

These notes and keepsakes were an ongoing private little project for me as I carried on with my other duties. It kept me closer to my children although I know it was a poor substitute for actually being there.

For many years the guilt of not being a full-time mother to my kids in their early years

gnawed at me. In some ways I think of these days with great sadness. I often wondered why I kept going. The job was intellectually stimulating and I truly loved what I was doing. I was sure I’d be miserable if I quit and I wasn’t willing to step out totally.

Trump joined Yahoo Finance for a wide-ranging conversation covering topics such as the U.S. economy COVID-19 vaccines cryptocurrencies and his thinking on a third run for the presidency in 2024. The full interview will be released on Monday.

Former President Donald Trump has revealed which COVID-19 vaccine he received before leaving the White House.

""Well I got the Pfizer and I would have been very happy with any of them"" Trump told Yahoo Finance Live in a wide-ranging interview.

The Trump administration spent $18 billion dollars on Operation Warp Speed to develop and deliver multiple vaccine candidates from firms like Pfizer (PFE) Moderna (MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) although Pfizer developed its vaccine without any money from the U.S. government.

Trump contracted COVID last fall at the height of the 2020 presidential campaign.

""I had it recovered from it pretty well. I don't think I had it like the press like the media said you know they would try to make it difficult"" the former president said. ""It's not pleasant but I had it.""

He and his wife Melania who also recovered from COVID last fall received their vaccinations shortly before leaving Washington in January but waited until last March to disclose that.

'I thought it would have been gone'

On Friday deaths from COVID-19 in the United States topped 700000 a grim milestone that makes the outbreak more deadly than the pandemics of 1918 and 1919.

""I thought it would have been gone long before now"" the former president told Yahoo Finance.

The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently authorized COVID-19 vaccine booster shots for Americans 65 years and older to protect against deadly variants of the virus.

Trump said he might get one ""If I felt that it was necessary and let's see where this whole thing is going.""

Even though Trump's Operation Warp Speed is credited with advancing the vaccine's development and distribution in record time the former president's supporters have been among the most resistant to the vaccine. At a recent rally in Cullman Alabama attendees booed Trump when he recommended they get inoculated against COVID-19.

""I believe totally in your freedoms I do you've got to do what you've got to do but I recommend that you take the vaccines"" Trump said at the time.

A CDC study showed unvaccinated people are more likely to die from COVID-19 than those who get the vaccines. From April to June unvaccinated people accounted for 95% of all new cases and 92% of deaths from COVID. From June through July the unvaccinated accounted for 82% of cases 86% of hospitalizations and 84% of deaths.

Story continues

President Joe Biden's administration has issued new requirements for private businesses mandating their employees get vaccinated. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is still formulating ways to enforce the mandate.

In his interview the former president expressed opposition to mandates faulting Biden for anti-vaccine sentiment.

Donald Trump has revealed for the first time that he received the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine before he left the White House.

“Well I got the Pfizer and I would have been very happy with any of them” the former president told Yahoo Finance Live.

Operation Warp Speed established during the Trump administration developed several vaccines from companies such as Moderna Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer. The programme received $18billion in funding but Pfizer managed to develop its vaccine without government money.

Mr Trump contracted Covid-19 in the autumn of 2020 as the presidential campaign was at its peak.

“I had it recovered from it pretty well. I don’t think I had it like the press like the media said you know they would try to make it difficult” he said. “It’s not pleasant but I had it.”

Former first lady Melania Trump was also vaccinated in January before leaving the White House but the Trumps didn’t reveal their vaccination status to the public until March.

Ms Trump also contracted Covid-19 during last year’s election campaign.

The US passed 700000 Covid deaths on Friday making it the deadliest pandemic in US history after surpassing the estimated 675000 deaths caused by the Spanish Flu in 1918 and 1919.

“I thought it would have been gone long before now” Mr Trump told Yahoo about Covid-19.

The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have given the green light for booster shots of the Covid-19 vaccine for those over the age of 65.

Mr Trump said he would get a booster shot “if I felt that it was necessary and let’s see where this whole thing is going”.

Despite Operation Warp Speed developing the vaccines in record time during Mr Trump’s time in office many of his supporters remain hesitant to get vaccinated with some outright hostile to the idea.

At a rally in Cullman Alabama some attendees booed when Mr Trump said that they should get vaccinated.

“I believe totally in your freedoms I do you’ve got to do what you've got to do but I recommend that you take the vaccines” he told the crowd.

According to the CDC unvaccinated people made up 95 per cent of all new Covid-19 cases and 92 per cent of all deaths from the disease between April and June.

In June and July the unvaccinated made up 82 per cent of all new cases 86 per cent of hospitalizations and 84 per cent of deaths.

President Joe Biden has issued new vaccine mandates for private businesses saying last month that his patience with those still not jabbed is “wearing thin”.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is working out how to enforce the new rules governing vaccines.

Mr Trump told Yahoo that he was against mandates and argued that Mr Biden had caused an uptick in anti-vaccine sentiments.

“When I was president everybody wanted to get the vaccine” Mr Trump claimed. “There was a rush to get it. You didn’t hear anything about mandates you didn’t hear anything about people not wanting to take it.

“After I left people don’t want to take it ... and I think it’s because they don’t trust Biden.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzAyL2FsZXhhbmRyaWEtb2Nhc2lvLWNvcnRlei1nZXRzLXBmaXplci1ib29zdGVyLWphYi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez gets Pfizer booster jab,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez received a booster dose of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine Friday.

The congresswoman revealed the news in an Instagram story that same evening.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez received a booster dose of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine Friday. Instagram

“My side effects from the first 2 shots have largely been sore arm and day-after fatigue. Right now my arm is sore again” she wrote. “But I am not as tired as I was the last time. We’ll see tomorrow.”

The congresswoman also shared a smiling photo of herself highlighting a bandaid over where she received the injection.

So far the Food and Drug Administration has approved the Pfizer coronavirus booster shot for use in certain populations six months after receiving their initial vaccine.

Anyone 65 years and older is eligible as well as anyone over 18 whose “frequent institutional or occupational exposure” puts them at “high risk of serious complications.”

As a member of Congress AOC is eligible to receive the vaccine as the capitol is considered a “high risk” workplace.

“I consulted with the House Physician about whether I should take the booster now or wait. His recommendation was that due to the high levels of community and member exposure in my work and because I am over nine months from my second shot I should take the booster” AOC told The Post.

“Many people do not know yet that young people are eligible in these circumstances so it’s a good way to get the word out!” she added.

The coronavirus booster has proved popular among Washington’s gerontocratic class with President Biden 78 and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell 79 both taking the extra jab in recent days.

October 3 2021 – From the same pandemic that sent the jobless rate to 20.2% in Snohomish County last year and near record high unemployment nationally causing millions to leave the work force arose nine new billionaires after shares in companies producing vaccines soared. The nine new billionaires collectively are worth $19.3 billion enough to vaccinate approximately 780 million people in low-income countries according to People’s Vaccine Alliance.

While the largest vaccination campaign in history may have saved an estimated 140000 deaths in the U.S. COVID vaccines are emerging as a $100 billion-plus business Bloomberg reported leaving many to wonder how much is too much to pay for health and safety.

The 9 new vaccine billionaires in order of their net worth are:

Stéphane Bancel Moderna’s CEO (worth $4.3 billion) Ugur Sahin CEO and co-founder of BioNTech (worth $4 billion) Timothy Springer an immunologist and founding investor of Moderna (worth $2.2 billion) Noubar Afeyan Moderna’s Chairman (worth $1.9 billion) Juan Lopez-Belmonte Chairman of ROVI a company with a deal to manufacture and package the Moderna vaccine (worth $1.8 billion) Robert Langer a scientist and founding investor in Moderna (worth $1.6 billion) Zhu Tao co-founder and chief scientific officer at CanSino Biologics (worth $1.3 billion) Qiu Dongxu co-founder and senior vice president at CanSino Biologics (worth $1.2 billion) Mao Huinhoa also co-founder and senior vice president at CanSino Biologics (worth $1 billion)

Record Profits for Big Pharma

An analysis by the People’s Vaccine Alliance alleges that firms Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are charging governments as much as $41 billion above the estimated cost of production at least five times more expensive than they could be.

Moderna and Pfizer are benefitting the most with Stephan Bancel CEO of Moderna and Ugur Sahin CEO of BioNTech now worth around $4 billion each. Pfizer reported in May their vaccine has brought in $3.5 billion in revenue in the first few months of 2021 nearly a quarter of its total revenue. Although Pfizer did not publish their profits publicly Bloomberg reported profit margins from vaccine sales could be around 20%.

In its July 2021 second-quarter report Pfizer updated its first-quarter revenue assumptions for the BNT162b2 – Pfizer-BioNTech SE (BioNTech) COVID-19 – vaccine from approximately $26 billion to $33.5 billion. For its second-quarter revenue Pfizer posted $19.0 billion of which $7.8 billion (41%) was related to COVID vaccine sales.

For the first six months of 2021 Pfizer reported $33.56 billion in overall revenue a 68% increase compared to the same period in 2020 with a Net Income of $10.44 billion. The vaccine division reported revenue of $14.13 billion within the first six months of which $11.3 billion (80%) is attributed to its BNT162b2 – Pfizer-BioNTech SE (BioNTech) COVID-19 – vaccine.

Because of this strong operational growth Pfizer updated its 2021 expected annual revenue guidelines from a range between $70.5-72.5 billion to $78-80 billion.

Frank D’Amelio

Frank D’Amelio Pfizer’s Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Global Supply downplayed the influence of COVID operations to the company’s recent growth.

“Pfizer’s second quarter performance highlighted once again the underlying strength of our business with consistent and solid growth coming from multiple products and categories. It is important to point out that the 10% year-over-year operational revenue growth rate for our business excluding BNT162b2 comes on top of a strong 6% operational growth rate delivered by the comparable business in the second quarter of last year. As a result of updates to our expectations for our business both including and excluding BNT162b2 we are increasing our 2021 financial guidance ranges for revenues and Adjusted diluted EPS for the second quarter in a row.”

Pfizer’s third-quarter performance report is expected November 2.

Moderna’s share prices have raised 700% since February 2020 while BioNTech has surged 600% CNN reported.

Moderna grew from 930 employees as of June 2020 to approximately 1800 employees a year later. Stéphane Bancel Chief Executive Officer of Moderna was more forthright with the company’s recent growth tied to its COVID vaccine operation.

“I am proud of the progress our teams at Moderna have made in the past quarter in advancing our development pipeline while addressing a global pandemic and quickly establishing global manufacturing and commercial organizations” said Stéphane Bancel Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. “We now have mRNA candidates in clinical trials across five therapeutic areas including infectious diseases cardiovascular oncology rare disease and autoimmune disorders. We are pleased that our COVID-19 vaccine is showing durable efficacy of 93% through six months but recognize that the Delta variant is a significant new threat so we must remain vigilant.”

In its second-quarter report Moderna reported total revenue of $6.3 billion for the first six months of this year of which net income was $4.0 billion. Moderna performed at a net loss of $(241) million for the same period in 2020.

According to the report “Total revenue increased in 2021 resulting from commercial sales of the Company’s COVID-19 vaccine and to a lesser extent grant revenue.”

The company expects dose capacity for its COVID-19 vaccine in 2022 to be between 2-3 billion doses.

The Lack of Vaccine Equity

The People’s Vaccine Alliance states that Pfizer/BioNTeach and Moderna have sold over 90% of their vaccines to “rich” countries leaving as many as 70 countries with only one dose for every ten people BBC reported. Their analysis found that rich countries have bought enough doses to vaccinate their population three times over. Canada for example has bought enough to vaccinate each Canadian five times their report claims.

Since BBC’s report “rich” countries have begun to re-distribute a fraction of their excess doses to low-income countries but Ellen Johnson Sirleaf former president of Liberia and Helen Clark former Prime Minister of New Zealand expressed concerns in August that the rate is still slow-going.

While the profits made by the vaccines have made the CEO’s of BioNTech and Moderna billionaires less than one percent of people in low-income countries have received the vaccine as of July 2021.

Before the pandemic low-income countries paid a median price of $0.80 a dose for all non-COVID-19 vaccines according to the World Health Organization (WHO). While every vaccine is different even the most affordable COVID vaccines Oxford/AstraZeneca is nearly four times more expensive the Johnson and Johnson vaccine is 13 times higher and the most expensive vaccines Pfizer Moderna and the Chinese produced Sinopharm are almost 50 times higher.

In a briefing published July the People’s Vaccination Alliance noted how both “poor” and “rich” countries have been potentially overpaying which included the following points. According to the study Pfizer/BioNTech charges the African Union $6.75 per dose nearly 6 times it estimates more than the potential production cost of this vaccine. One dose of the vaccine costs the same as Uganda spends per citizen on health ($6.83) in a whole year.

The highest reported price paid for Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines was paid by Israel at $28 a dose ―nearly 24 times the potential production cost. The European Union may have overpaid for its Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines by as much as €31 billion.

South Africa turned down Moderna’s price tag of $42 per dose. Colombia allegedly paid double the US price for Moderna vaccines. For Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech combined the country has potentially overpaid by as much as $375 million.

Senegal a lower-income nation said it paid around $4 million for 200000 doses for the Chinese vaccine Sinopharm which equates to $20 per dose.

The United Kingdom alone has potentially paid £1.8 billion more than the cost of production for its Pfizer and Moderna vaccines ―enough money to pay every worker in its National Health Service (NHS) a bonus of more than £1000.

The Lown Institute in Boston gave Moderna one of its Shkreli Awards in January for the ”Blatantly greedy COVID vaccine prices.”

Government Funds that Paved COVID Vaccine Success

According to the Forbes article Which Companies Received The Most Covid-19 Vaccine R&D Funding? the United States and Germany have provided $2 billion and $1.5 billion respectively to pharmaceutical companies for COVID-19 vaccine research.

During a House Committee on Energy and Commerce hearing last summer vaccine manufacturers were asked if they would sell their product at cost. Dr. Stephan Hoge president of Moderna told lawmakers that they would not sell their vaccine at cost despite receiving $955 million in U.S. funding.

The Boston-based company said last August it would charge between $32 and $37 per dose but the price would be adjusted depending on the amount ordered which may explain why different countries are paying different prices for vaccines. Stephan Hoge

South Africa for example paid $5.25 per dose in January for 1.5 million doses of the Oxford and AstraZeneca vaccine more than twice what the European Union paid at $2.15 per dose a BMJ report states. As it stands governments around the world are the only purchasers of the COVID vaccines.

AstraZeneca like Moderna also received hundreds of millions in government funding upfront for millions of doses. However they made the promise last year not profit off their vaccine sales.

BioNTech who developed the first authorized COVID-19 vaccine in the United States received some $800 million in R&D funding.

Pfizer on the other hand did not receive any government funding stating that they wanted to move as quickly as possible to get their vaccine into clinics. At the congressional hearing last summer some House members raised concerns that Pfizer’s rejection of federal funds could lead to price-gouging and lack of transparency the New York Times reported.

COVID Vaccination Progress

As of October 2 a total of 6.33 billion doses of vaccine have been administered in 184 countries throughout the globe according to Bloomberg. This equates to 41.2% of the world’s population. Bloomberg reported 395 million doses of the vaccine have already been administered in the U.S. and 759656 have been given daily within the last week equating to 61.6% of the population covered.

According to the article “Population covered divides the doses administered for each vaccine type by the number of doses required for full vaccination.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9wdGktc3Rvcmllcy9wZml6ZXItdG8tc2VsbC11cGpvaG4tYnVzaW5lc3MtdG8tbXlsYW4tcGhhcm1hLWZvci1ycy0xODAtNDgtY3JvcmUtMTIxMTAwMTAxNTE2XzEuaHRtbNIBkAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvcHRpLXN0b3JpZXMvcGZpemVyLXRvLXNlbGwtdXBqb2huLWJ1c2luZXNzLXRvLW15bGFuLXBoYXJtYS1mb3ItcnMtMTgwLTQ4LWNyb3JlLTEyMTEwMDEwMTUxNl8xLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer to sell Upjohn business to Mylan Pharma for Rs 180.48 crore,"Drug firm Pfizer Ltd on Friday said it has entered into an agreement with Mylan Pharmaceuticals to sell its Upjohn business for Rs 180.48 crore.

The company has entered into a business transfer agreement with Mylan Pharmaceuticals to transfer certain primarily off-patent branded and generic established medicines (Upjohn business) as a going concern to Mylan for a consideration of Rs 180.48 crore Pfizer Ltd said in a regulatory filing.

The consideration for the transfer is supported by valuation reports issued by two independent valuers it added.

""The Upjohn Business comprises six brands which include Lyrica Viagra Celebrex Amlogard Daxid and Dilantin. These along with related business assets and liabilities will transition to Mylan"" the filing said.

The rationale for the transaction is that Pfizer Inc USA on July 29 2019 announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to combine its Upjohn business -- which consists of off-patented branded and generic established medicines -- with Mylan N.V. thereby creating a new global pharmaceutical company Viatris Inc.

The global transaction was closed in November 2020.

Under the global transaction six brands currently marketed by Pfizer Ltd in India viz. Lyrica Viagra Celebrex Amlogard Daxid and Dilantin will transition to Mylan Pharmaceuticals.

The transaction in India will be closed upon receipt of regulatory approvals Pfizer Ltd said."

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9jaW5jaW5uYXRpL25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWF0dG9ybmV5LXByaXNvbi1yZWxlYXNlLWFwcGVhbC5odG1s0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYml6am91cm5hbHMuY29tL2NpbmNpbm5hdGkvbmV3cy8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtYXR0b3JuZXktcHJpc29uLXJlbGVhc2UtYXBwZWFsLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League."

Ferrari and F1 fans have become accustomed to seeing the red cars on the grid for a long time. In recent years fans would have been familiar with the sight of a certain Mission Winnow. This has been present on the rear wings and its logo on the engine cover.

This particular sponsor has seen Ferrari get into a lot of trouble over the past few seasons due to its association with Philip Morris International(PMI). PMI is one of the leading producers of cigarettes in the world.

F1 has been looking to wean itself off the tobacco advertising as many of the countries in which the sport organizes races have strict anti-tobacco advertisement laws.

What is Mission Winnow?

Mission Winnow is a brand of PMI which according to its official website ‘is a communications platform that stands for progress transparency facts over preconceptions and the relentless search for improvement.’

The mission statement of the company on its official website states that it seeks to ‘drive change by constantly searching for better ways of doing things. And by committing to learning and knowing more it’s easier to make choices that improve the future for everyone.’

Why the partnership with Ferrari?

Ferrari have had a long-standing association with PMI. They were sponsored by Marlboro PMI’s most best-selling and well-recognized brand for a very long time.

This association saw the Italian team showcase the logo of Marlboro as their title sponsor on their rear wing for close to 14 years from 1997 to 2011. But since F1’s ban on tobacco advertising on livery since 2008 the Italian team has replaced it with a barcode after which the team went to having Scuderia Ferrari on the rear wing despite Marlboro staying on as a sponsor.

But this barcode has been cleverly used as a way of subliminal advertising.

In 2018 the Prancing Horses made the switch to Mission Winnow as a title sponsor. This saw them get featured on the car’s rear wing for certain races.

Why was Mission Winnow not featured on the livery of Ferrari at certain races?

This is largely due to the strict anti-tobacco advertising laws in certain countries. Over the past few years Ferrari have been unable to field the Mission Winnow branded car at certain races.

BY EVERSON MUSHAVA Experts have called for tobacco manufactures to develop safer solutions for people living in poor countries who constitute the majority of smokers.

Speaking at the Global Tobacco and Nicotine Forum held virtually last week the experts also implored governments to embark on evidence-based policy making in order to reduce the number of smokers worldwide.

“I would like to use this platform to request manufacturers to focus on developing safer solutions for people living in (low-to medium income countries) LMICs will account for 80% of the world’s tobacco users and who would benefit the most from risk reduction given that they have mere means to deal with the consequences of tobacco use” Indian tobacco harm reduction expert Samrat Chowdhery said.

Tobacco is a main revenue earner for southern African countries such as Zimbabwe and Malawi. The majority of farm workers in the two countries smoke untreated tobacco which has grave health consequences.

Laura Leigh Oyler a regulator at a US company said “policies have been designed to marginalise smokers making them invisible to the rest of society. I think this is a bad thing and don’t want more policies that stigmatize smokers—I believe we have too many of those in the US already.”

The experts noted that although the World Health Organisation has been promoting anti-smoking messages research has actually shown that few smokers are quitting smoking or transitioning to e-cigarettes that are nicotine free.

But another tobacco harm reduction expert James Glassman said it was possible to get smokers to switch to less harmful practices and eventually in many cases quit tobacco altogether.

“Certainly new technology is not the only means to ending smoking” Glassman said.

“Misinformation is as deadly for tobacco as it is for COVID-19. For companies to play an increased role they must show increased responsibility.”

He added: “There’s no greater global health challenge than the millions of deaths and the trillions of dollars wasted because of smoking. We can reignite the fight. The best evidence is about 70% of smokers say they want to quit and they are not able to do that.”

But Simon Clark director of a smokers lobby group Forest said a survey of over 600 smokers by the Centre for Substance Use Research in Glasgow found that 95% respondents to a recent survey gave pleasure as their primary reasons for smoking.

Many of those surveyed 77% expected to smoke for many years with only 5% envisaging a time in the near future when they could stop.

More than half the respondents 59% had used alternative nicotine delivery products such as e-cigarettes. Few however were persuaded to switch permanently from cigarettes to vaping.

South African doctor Delon Human who has a history of collaborating with British American Tobacco (BAT) on tobacco harm reduction said there was ‘absolute consensus’ that evidence-based policies was the way to go.

“We have just heard that the risk continuum is being confirmed and practiced within the FDA. And we would hope in most other countries who are members states of the world health organization” Human said.

Vice-president Global Scientific Engagement at Philip Morris International (PMI) Gizelle Baker said successful harm reduction requires that adult smokers have access to information and alternative products for them to be able to switch.

“When you have contradictory information conflicting findings an ever-changing evidence pool coming out there” Baker said.

“Anything that drives uncertainty it leads to a consumer base that is completely confused.

“And when you have confusion you drive indecision you drive in action and you drive ultimately people wondering what does it mean for these products and even more confusing what does it mean to me?”

PMI which has been conducting wide research on tobacco harm reduction has produced a reduced risk tobacco product the Iqos that allows for smokeless consumption.

“Well at PMI we started doing studies on this and we have a most recent study a multinational study that was just conducted looking at how does misinformation lead to misunderstandings? And we did it in tobacco world” Baker said.

“So let us look at misunderstandings of risk. In this multi-country over 29000-person survey we found that over 45% wrongly believed that smoke-free products are equally or more harmful than cigarettes.

“And actually when we broke it apart it was 45% for e-cigarettes 46% for heated tobacco products; almost 60% misunderstand what causes smoking related disease.”

Another expert Will Godfrey said there was need to reduce the harm directly caused by certain forms of drug use as well as that which is caused by bad drug policies.",,,,,,,,,

Branded the Pandora papers the cache includes 11.9m files from companies hired by wealthy clients to create offshore structures and trusts in tax havens such as Panama Dubai Monaco Switzerland and the Cayman Islands.

They expose the secret offshore affairs of 35 world leaders including current and former presidents prime ministers and heads of state. They also shine a light on the secret finances of more than 300 other public officials such as government ministers judges mayors and military generals in more than 90 countries.

The files include disclosures about major donors to the Conservative party raising difficult questions for Boris Johnson as his party meets for its annual conference.

More than 100 billionaires feature in the leaked data as well as celebrities rock stars and business leaders. Many use shell companies to hold luxury items such as property and yachts as well as incognito bank accounts. There is even art ranging from looted Cambodian antiquities to paintings by Picasso and murals by Banksy.

The Pandora papers reveal the inner workings of what is a shadow financial world providing a rare window into the hidden operations of a global offshore economy that enables some of the world’s richest people to hide their wealth and in some cases pay little or no tax.

Quick Guide What are the Pandora papers? Show The Pandora papers are the largest trove of leaked data exposing tax haven secrecy in history. They provide a rare window into the hidden world of offshore finance casting light on the financial secrets of some of the world’s richest people. The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) which shared access with the Guardian BBC and other media outlets around the world. In total the trove consists of 11.9m files leaked from a total of 14 offshore service providers totalling 2.94 terabytes of information. That makes it larger in volume than both the Panama papers (2016) and Paradise papers (2017) two previous offshore leaks. Where did the Pandora documents come from? The ICIJ a Washington DC-based journalism nonprofit is not identifying the source of the leaked documents. In order to facilitate a global investigation the ICIJ gave remote access to the documents to journalists in 117 countries including reporters at the Washington Post Le Monde El País Süddeutsche Zeitung PBS Frontline and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In the UK the investigation has been led by the Guardian and BBC Panorama. What is an offshore service provider? The 14 offshore service providers in the leak provide corporate services to individuals or companies seeking to do business offshore. Their clients are typically seeking to discreetly set up companies or trusts in lightly regulated tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands (BVI) Panama the Cook Islands and the US state of South Dakota. Companies registered offshore can be used to hold assets such as property aircraft yachts and investments in stocks and shares. By holding those assets in an offshore company it is possible to hide from the rest of the world the identity of the person they actually belong to or the “beneficial owner”. Why do people move money offshore? Usually for reasons of tax secrecy or regulation. Offshore jurisdictions tend to have no income or corporation taxes which makes them potentially attractive to wealthy individuals and companies who don’t want to pay taxes in their home countries. Although morally questionable this kind of tax avoidance can be legal. Offshore jurisdictions also tend to be highly secretive and publish little or no information about the companies or trusts incorporated there. This can make them useful to criminals such as tax evaders or money launderers who need to hide money from tax or law enforcement authorities. It is also true that people in corrupt or unstable countries may use offshore providers to put their assets beyond the reach of repressive governments or criminal adversaries who may try to seize them or to seek to circumvent hard currency restrictions. Others may go offshore for reasons of inheritance or estate planning. Has everyone named in the Pandora papers done something wrong? No. Moving money offshore is not in or of itself illegal and there are legitimate reasons why some people do it. Not everyone named in the Pandora papers is suspected of wrongdoing. Those who are may stand accused of a wide range of misbehaviour: from the morally questionable through to the potentially criminal. The Guardian is only publishing stories based on leaked documents after considering the public interest. That is a broad concept that may include furthering transparency by revealing the secret offshore owners of UK property even where those owners have done nothing wrong. Other articles might illuminate issues of important public debate raise moral questions shed light on how the offshore industry operates or help inform voters about politicians or donors in the interests of democratic accountability.

There are emails memos incorporation records share certificates compliance reports and complex diagrams showing labyrinthine corporate structures. Often they allow the true owners of opaque shell companies to be identified for the first time.

The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington. It shared access to the leaked data with select media partners including the Guardian BBC Panorama Le Monde and the Washington Post. More than 600 journalists have sifted through the files as part of a massive global investigation.

The Pandora papers represent the latest – and largest in terms of data volume – in a series of major leaks of financial data that have convulsed the offshore world since 2013.

Setting up or benefiting from offshore entities is not itself illegal and in some cases people may have legitimate reasons such as security for doing so. But the secrecy offered by tax havens has at times proven attractive to tax evaders fraudsters and money launderers some of whom are exposed in the files.

Other wealthy individuals and companies stash their assets offshore to avoid paying tax elsewhere a legal activity estimated to cost governments billions in lost revenues.

After more than 18 months analysing the data in the public interest the Guardian and other media outlets will publish their findings over the coming days beginning with revelations about the offshore financial affairs of some of the most powerful political leaders in the world.

They include the ruler of Jordan King Abdullah II who leaked documents reveal has amassed a secret $100m property empire spanning Malibu Washington and London. The king declined to answer specific questions but said there would be nothing improper about him owning properties via offshore companies. Jordan appeared to have blocked the ICIJ website on Sunday hours before the Pandora papers launched.

The files also show that Azerbaijan’s ruling Aliyev family has traded close to £400m of UK property in recent years. One of their properties was sold to the Queen’s crown estate which is now looking into how it came to pay £67m to a company that operated as a front for the family that runs a country routinely accused of corruption. The Aliyevs declined to comment.

The Pandora papers also threaten to cause political upsets for two European Union leaders. The prime minister of the Czech republic Andrej Babiš who is up for election this week is facing questions over why he used an offshore investment company to acquire a $22m chateau in the south of France. He too declined to comment.

And in Cyprus itself a controversial offshore centre the president Nicos Anastasiades may be asked to explain why a law firm he founded was accused of hiding the assets of a controversial Russian billionaire behind fake company owners. The firm denies any wrongdoing while the Cypriot president says he ceased having an active role in its affairs after becoming leader of the opposition in 1997.

Not everyone named in the Pandora papers is accused of wrongdoing. The leaked files reveals that Tony and Cherie Blair saved £312000 in property taxes when they purchased a London building partially owned by the family of a prominent Bahraini minister.

The former prime minister and his wife bought the £6.5m office in Marylebone by acquiring a British Virgin Islands (BVI) offshore company. While the move was not illegal and there is no evidence the Blairs proactively sought to avoid property taxes the deal highlights a loophole that has enabled wealthy property owners not to pay a tax that is commonplace for ordinary Britons.

The leaked records vividly illustrate the central coordinating role London plays in the murky offshore world. The UK capital is home to wealth managers law firms company formation agents and accountants. All exist to serve their ultra-rich clients. Many are foreign-born tycoons who enjoy “non-domicile” status which means they pay no tax on their overseas assets.

View image in fullscreen The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy is also named in the leak. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy who was elected in 2019 on a pledge to clean up his country’s notoriously corrupt and oligarch-influenced economy is also named in the leak. During the campaign Zelenskiy transferred his 25% stake in an offshore company to a close friend who now works as the president’s top adviser the files suggest. Zelenskiy declined to comment and it is unclear if he remains a beneficiary.

The Russian president Vladimir Putin whom the US suspects of having a secret fortune does not appear in the files by name. But numerous close associates do including his best friend from childhood – the late Petr Kolbin – whom critics have called a “wallet” for Putin’s own wealth and a woman the Russian leader was allegedly once romantically involved with. None responded to invitations to comment.

The Pandora papers also place a revealing spotlight on the offshore system itself. In a development likely to prove embarrassing for the US president Joe Biden who has pledged to lead efforts internationally to bring transparency to the global financial system the US emerges from the leak as a leading tax haven. The files suggest the state of South Dakota in particular is sheltering billions of dollars in wealth linked to individuals previously accused of serious financial crimes.

The offshore trail also stretches from Africa to Latin America to Asia and is likely to pose difficult questions for politicians across the world. In Pakistan Moonis Elahi a prominent minister in prime minister Imran Khan’s government contacted an offshore provider in Singapore about investing $33.7m.

In Kenya the president Uhuru Kenyatta has portrayed himself as an enemy of corruption. In 2018 Kenyatta told the BBC: “Every public servant’s assets must be declared publicly so that people can question and ask: what is legitimate?”

He will come under pressure to explain why he and his close relatives amassed more than $30m of offshore wealth including property in London. Kenyatta did not respond to enquiries about whether his family wealth was declared to relevant authorities in Kenya.

The Pandora papers also reveal some of the unseen repercussions of previous offshore leaks which spurred modest reforms in some parts of the world such as the BVI which now keeps a record of the real owners of companies registered there. However the newly leaked data shows money shifting around offshore destinations as wealthy clients and their advisers adjust to new realities.

Some clients of Mossack Fonseca the now defunct law firm at the heart of the 2016 Panama papers disclosures simply transferred their companies to rival providers such as another global trust and corporate administrator with a major office in London whose data is in the new trove of leaked files.

Asked why he was migrating the new company one customer wrote bluntly: “Business decision to exit following the Panama papers.” Another agent said the industry had always “adapted” to external pressure.

2:35 Pandora papers: senior Conservatives dodge questions about donors – video

Some leaked files appear to show some in the industry seeking to circumvent new privacy regulations. One Swiss lawyer refused to email the names of his high-value customers to a service provider in the BVI following new legislation. Instead he sent them by airmail with strict instructions they should not be processed in any “electronic way”. The identity of another beneficial owner was shared via WhatsApp.

“The purpose of this way to proceed is to enable you to comply with BVI rules” the lawyer wrote. Referring to Mossack Fonseca the lawyer added: “You are obliged to keep secrecy for our clients and to not make feasible at all a second ‘Panama papers’ story that happened to one of your competitors.”

Gerard Ryle the director of the ICIJ said leading politicians who organised their finances in tax havens had a stake in the status quo and were likely to be an obstacle to reform of the offshore economy. “When you have world leaders when you have politicians when you have public officials all using the secrecy and all using this world then I don’t think we’re going to see an end to it.”

He expected the Pandora papers to have a greater impact than previous leaks not least because they were arriving in the middle of a pandemic that had exacerbated inequalities and forced governments to borrow unprecedented amounts to be shouldered by ordinary taxpayers. “This is the Panama papers on steroids” Ryle said. “It’s broader richer and has more detail.”

At least $11.3tn in wealth is held offshore according to a 2020 study by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). “This is money that is being lost to treasuries around the world and money that could be used to recover from Covid” Ryle said. “We’re losing out because some people are gaining. It’s as simple as that. It’s a very simple transaction that’s going on here.”

Procter & Gamble is vacating its namesake Toronto office building.

The consumer goods company is downsizing from its 90000 sq ft office at 4711 Yonge Street. CBRE is marketing the concourse ground floor and second floor block at the Yonge and Sheppard tower which is owned by Menkes. P&G declined to comment on its move.

While pricing for the P&G office space was not available the asking net rent for the 15th floor is $21/sq ft on par with the average for the North Yonge submarket. Additional rent for the 23000 sq ft space is $23.61/sq ft. Suite 902 at 17000 sq ft asks the same.

As of the end of Q1 the office vacancy rate in the North York submarket was 24.7% higher than the Toronto North average of 19.3%.

The P&G block is available as of Feb 1 2025 and podium signage is offered. The space is being marketed towards life sciences companies and data centre operators. It offers 25 watts of power per sq ft.

The 16-storey Class-A office tower was built in 1987. It’s LEED platinum certified and has seven elevators car-charging stations and a café.

One underground unreserved parking space is available per 1000 rentable sq ft. Highway 401 and six GO Bus routes are nearby and there is direct underground access to the Yonge-Shephard subway station.

Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.

Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year.

ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

Dressed in a white apron with her brown hair tied back in a blue ribbon Flo is known for always having a smile on her face as she pitches insurance to the viewers of the over 100 commercials she's starred in but what about the woman behind the character? What does Flo look like in real life?

Flo is and has always been played by an actor named Stephanie Courtney who started out in improvisational comedy. She joined The Groundlings sketch comedy group before appearing in her first Progressive commercial in 2008 and the rest is advertising history. Read on to learn more about Courtney and what she's doing when she's not selling insurance.

RELATED: 12 Actors Who Look Exactly Like the Real People They Played.

In real life Courtney is a comedian and mom.

When she's not wearing her white apron Courtney is an actor wife and mother. Though she is no longer with the main company of The Groundlings—where famous comedians including Lisa Kudrow and Kristen Wiig also got their start—she has a recurring role as Essie Karp on the '80s-set sitcom The Goldbergs. Outside of her professional life Courtney is married to Scott Kolanach the lighting director for her former comedy group and together they have a son.

""Every crazy old lady character I ever walked out as on that stage had beautiful peachy gem lighting because he liked me"" she told People.

And though we've welcomed Flo into our homes via our TVs so many times over the years that it feels like we know her the performer behind her is much more private. Courtney seldom posts on her Instagram account and once told The Daily Beast that she lets her husband stay aware of all things internet-related when it comes to her famous onscreen personality. (Yes Flo has fan accounts.)

Courtney has said she feels like she lives a double life.

Flo has truly become such a major pop culture staple that you might assume Courtney would be stopped everywhere she goes but she told Cosmopolitan that without the costume and makeup she rarely gets recognized when she's out in public.ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb

""Sometimes I feel like I have a double life. I am made up so hardcore for Flo. My hair is teased to the heavens and I have tons of makeup on"" she said. ""But when I'm driving around in a ponytail rarely does anyone know who I am. I've never had a drink sent to my table.""

In fact in 2016 Courtney told Emmy Magazine that without ""all of Flo's crazy makeup"" she doesn't think she looks like her much at all. And that's probably saved her from some awkward encounters.

She made up her own backstory for Flo.

Courtney doesn't just star in the Progressive commercials she's also created a bit of a backstory for Flo as well. She started off by basing her character on her mom Jane Courtney and has kept filling in more details about Flo's life and where she lives. Learning how Courtney pictures her it's easier to understand why Flo is so happy all the time.

""When I picture Flo in life she drives her little Mini Cooper around town and it's basically like when Bob Hoskins drove into Toontown in Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" she told Cleveland.com. ""Basically all the buildings and the birds are singing in her mind. And little humming birds are like 'Hello Flo! Bye Flo!' So I think that's how she sees the world: just a great big Toontown. And I think she's just so excited for any good quality she sees in a person. She's just beyond happy for them; if it's a cute sweater or they picked a great insurance. She's just beside herself. It's made her day.""

You've probably seen her in TV shows and movies too.

Courtney's main gig might be playing Flo but it's not her only gig. Aside from her recurring role in The Goldbergs she's also scored parts in shows including 2 Broke Girls House and You're The Worst. You might also have spotted Courtney in the movies The Heartbreak Kid and Blades of Glory.

Courtney sees auditioning and rejection as just part of the business now which must be a little easier when you've been headlining one of the most popular ad campaigns for years.

""Originally I auditioned for Joan for Mad Men"" she told Cosmopolitan. ""They said 'You didn't get that but will you play a switchboard operator instead?' I said 'Sure!' Then I saw Christina Hendricks in that emerald dress and I went Oh I get it now. I also auditioned for Pam for The Office. I didn't get far in that audition but I was such a fan of the British Office I was just excited to be there.""

They’re both part of the president’s agenda. We are making sure we’re holding up the women who need child care the families who need child care and paid leave.

The Government of India has finally decided to dissolve the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) making way for seven new (wholly government-owned) corporate entities who shall now take over the running of the ordnance factories and other facilities.

The move is meant to help improve the abysmal quality of products that OFB has become notorious for. It has been consistently supplying overpriced sub-standard products to both its government buyers (military para-military police forces etc.) as well as to ordinary Indian civilian customers.

Advertisement

Most of the buzz is around the corporatisation of the OFB and focussed on how this may impact military supplies and job security of workers but few people are discussing the products they sell in the civilian market and how this move may impact potential civilian customers.

As many readers would not be conversant with the status of civilian gun ownership in India a little background may be appropriate here.

Civilian gun ownership in India

Prior to the advent of colonial rule in India arms of all manner and types were freely owned and carried by all sections of society. In those times it was unusual for anyone to venture out of their homes without being armed in some manner.

The British rulers with an ingrained distrust of their Indian subjects had passed numerous stringent laws with the sole objective of disarming and subjugating the Indian population. These laws exempted all Europeans while placing strict controls and penalties on Indians owning any type of weapon.

Advertisement

Post-Independence the Right to Keep and Bear Arms was recognised as a Legal Right through the Arms Act of 1959 which allows any Indian citizen not previously convicted of a violent crime or with any history of mental health issues to apply for and acquire an arms licence.

Like any other government-issued licence this process is highly subjective corrupt and humiliating and obviously geared towards dissuading ordinary applicants. The process ensures that unless the applicant is well-connected or willing to grease the right palms the application will invariably be turned down.

Advertisement

The only times when an ordinary citizen usually has any chance of getting a firearm license is if the applicant has inherited a firearm or has achievements to show in shooting sports. As a result in India it is rare for an ordinary middle-class citizen to have an arms licence.

OFB and civilian firearms

Advertisement

OFB has a long history of manufacturing firearms and ammunition specifically meant for sale to civilians in India. Initially starting out with the manufacture of sporting rifles chambered for the .315 cartridge (8x50R) these were the sporting version of the same Lee Enfield rifles being supplied to the government in .303 British and later in 7.62x51 calibres. Later on they also started supplying 12-bore double-barrel shotguns which were a copy of a Birmingham Small Arms design.

Till 1986 when the civilian import of all firearms was banned these OFB products were usually of acceptable quality and priced much lower than the imported firearms which were being sold here for up to three times their overseas price largely because of import duties and dealer profits. This direct competition with global manufacturers ensured that the OFB maintained a certain level of quality and price.

A few years ago a friend found some OFB made 12-bore cartridges in his store dating from the early 1980s. We took them to the range and tried them against those currently manufactured by OFB: the older lot was far superior in performance despite lying in storage for almost half a century!

After the 1986 ban on imports OFB got a virtual monopoly on the manufacture and sale of civilian firearms and ammunition in India. Monopolies are usually never good for customers or the market. This OFB monopoly led to a massive deterioration in quality as well as steady upward price increases of the weapons for civilian sale. The buyer had no other choice.

In the late 1980s the OFB began producing a copy of the Enfield No. 2 revolver (a simplified version of the century-old Webley design) chambered for the .32 S&W Long cartridge. Later on they also added to their product line a semi-automatic pistol a mish-mash copy of the Browning 1910 and Colt 1903 models. Both of these are currently priced at about a lakh rupees.

By comparison similar products made by any of the global manufacturers and of much superior quality retail overseas for a third or even less – this would include the profit margin of the manufacturer distributor as well as the retailer.

Take a long look

Will reforming the OFB make a difference? Before we begin to explore if and how corporatisation could help improve the quality of OFB’s products we should consider another big policy change that came into effect in 2016.

Beginning in 2016 the Government of India began accepting applications for licences for the manufacture of arms and ammunition from private companies. Prior to this only a few small-scale units had been allowed to manufacture small quantities of shotguns and antiquated muzzle-loaders and fresh licences for these had not been issued for several decades either.

Several Indian companies have been granted licence to manufacture arms and ammunition in India. However the focus of almost all of these companies is on government sales as that is where the big sales volumes lie. Most of these companies have tied up with foreign collaborators and are looking at bringing in their product lines here in order to bid for big military and police contracts.

The vision of the government is a vibrant eco-system of domestic manufacturers who should eventually be able to compete in global markets. The point to consider is that while all of these companies set up facilities in India and compete for a few government tenders what would happen to the huge investments of those that are unable to win the tender bids?

In countries with a vibrant firearms manufacturing industry a large part of the industry is sustained by (domestic and export) civilian sales. So even if a company loses one tender it continues research and development all the while staying in business with the support of civilian customers.

When OFB had a monopoly on government orders and a marginal business of civilian sales these considerations didn’t really matter. But with multiple companies setting up shop in India the government needs to also take a long and hard look at the policies being followed for the issuance of arms licences to ordinary law-abiding citizens.

All crime statistics underline the fact that licenced firearms do not contribute to crime; if anything they most often help prevent heinous crimes by offering citizens a real chance to defend themselves.

Without the support of a vibrant civilian firearms market it is hard to imagine how we can ever hope to become a hub for manufacturing or innovation in this field.

Trading the yen and the yuan structuring derivatives and providing the world’s financial plumbing are all money-spinners but they barely register in the public imagination. The exception is the stockmarket. Daily news bulletins report trading on the FTSE 100 index of leading London shares. Booms and busts are charted by its gyrations. The London Stock Exchange ( LSE ) is the stamping-ground of giant multinationals where city-slickers and corporate fat-cats thrash out huge deals to buy and sell the world’s companies.

Or at least it used to be. London’s high-flying stockmarket has spent the past decade tumbling back to earth. In 2006 the companies with shares listed in London were worth 10.4% of the global equity market. Today that figure is 3.6%. London has lagged behind even the laggards: its share of Europe’s total market value has declined from 36% to 22% over the same period. The denizens of the LSE that are left look geriatric. Less than one-fiftieth of the FTSE 100’s value comes from tech companies compared with almost 40% of the S&P 500 index of American firms.

Call it the new currency of investment. Consciousness about Environment ESG ) factors in running companies has been rising steadily. Growing inequalities need for social justice better disclosure requirements and extreme weather conditions playing out around us have all led to a call for action in more ways than one. It has also catalysed investments into companies that pay special attention to environmental social and governance issues.Simply put analysts study a company’s ‘Environmental Social and Governance’ framework and measure growth opportunities and risks faced by them which are typically not part of regular financial reporting. More and more companies in India today are making ESG disclosures in their annual reports and some are even developing standalone ESG or sustainability reports. These reports showcase the initiatives taken to reduce the carbon footprint water and air pollution and include fair labour practices human rights and ethical business practices.ESG first came to the fore in the United Nations Global Compact report issued in 2005. The report established the need to integrate ESG factors into capital markets to profit both companies and investors. Since then ESG is no longer regarded as a niche concept. As an investor using the ESG criteria can help you determine the future financial performance of a business.The future of our environment has become a priority among communities governments and economies. Issues such as climate change carbon emissions and deforestation have detrimental implications. Hence to tackle these issues there is an urgent need to generate social change political action and financial support. To drive the overall ESG agenda regulators have been nudging companies towards better disclosures and reporting.Typically businesses profit from economic rise higher consumption and globalisation. These factors have always supported and reinforced the role of businesses as providers of products services careers and infrastructure. But in recent times a company’s contribution to critical sustainability concerns such as climate change biodiversity human rights and inclusion have also risen.Synchronously the rise of technology has enabled stakeholders and shareholders to question the manner in which businesses act. All these have brought about a greater need for transparent measurement and disclosure of sustainability performance. For instance through corporate reporting you can identify and measure the company’s performance in the same manner as it uses the ESG report to make the right decisions.ESG strategies are sustainable and have proven they can offer good returns. According to the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing February 2021 Sustainable Funds outperformed their traditional peers. The report also revealed how monies invested in sustainable businesses offer lower market risk.As per Bloomberg data the MSCI India ESG Index has consistently outperformed its benchmark i.e. MSCI India from May 2011 to March 2021. The Nifty 100 ESG Index too has outperformed the Nifty50 and Nifty100 across both one and five-year time frames.Retail investors always have the option to evaluate the ESG initiatives of companies and make direct investments. This could however be time consuming and tedious and therefore should be left to experienced fund managers. They have the necessary expertise and tools to analyse the financial performance and ESG initiatives together to make appropriate investment decisions.Investing in an ESG fund offered by retail money managers or life insurance companies can give you the opportunity to seek good returns and make a positive environmental and social impact. Such funds use ESG principles and invest in companies that are making efforts to protect the environment be equitable and have high standards of governance. Through rigorous research fund managers identify companies with the right ESG values and invest your money in these companies to generate returns.Most money managers today have a clearly articulated ‘Responsible Investing Framework’. Such a framework specifies how they choose to invest in companies that have better ESG practices with a focus on governance which is then monitored through their stewardship policies exclusion principles and external ESG ratings along with internal evaluation.With more asset managers offering ESG funds as an investment option to retail investors companies are being directly impacted. Becoming ESG-compliant not only increases their relevance as an investment option but also enables them to make a positive impact for the betterment of society. With investors progressively gravitating towards investing in ESG-oriented funds they are making a difference in the way corporations function.In fact international investors investing in India-listed entities very closely scrutinise their ESG initiatives and base their investment decisions accordingly. Globally assets under management (AUM) by ESG funds exceed $35 trillion. While the concept of ESG Funds is relatively new in India as of July 2021 the total AUM stood at approximately Rs 115 billion.A vast majority of millennials today are conscious of environmental concerns ensuring social equity and proper governance which is likely to drive their investment decisions. It is a win-win situation as not only does it provide them with returns but also serves as a route for them to positively contribute to the society.Given the millennial activism and spurt in sustainable investing it is time for every generation to consider the ESG investment option. As more and more companies regulate their strategies and establish good corporate social responsibility ESG investing will pave the trail for a sustainable and profitable tomorrow.If you’re an investor that values the principles of ESG it’s time to embrace responsible investing. ESG investing can be an excellent way of complimenting your portfolio with funds that reflect your standards and ethics while providing good returns.(Jitendra Arora is Executive Vice President for Investments at ICICI Prudential Life Insurance.

Some will also recall it was on the Oregon and Chisholm trails was near Gill’s Pony Express Station and after the arrival of the Union Pacific Railroad in 1867 became a wild and untamed terminus for Texas cattle.

A very few will remember it as the home of Robert Goodall known by many worldwide as the Edison of the west though many histories of Keith County mention him only in passing and a couple of respected historians do not even mention him.

Henry E. Goodall was born in London in 1849. In 1872 he arrived in Nebraska vowing to go west “as far as the train would take him.” The rails ended at Howard Nebraska where he homesteaded and built a house probably of sod.

Henry was admitted to the Nebraska Bar in 1889 though he continued to operate a 950-acre ranch at Korty Nebraska. On Oct. 8 1891 his son Robert Aldrich Goodall was born at Grant Nebraska. Henry his wife Clarise and son Robert moved to Ogallala in 1897 where Henry began a law practice.

Around the turn of the century Anna Gray Clark bought the Democrat-leaning Keith County News from G. F. Cooper while Carrie Goodall purchased the Republican Argus. This led to friendly editorial competition between the two political factions and newspapers and also furnished readers a balance of opinions.

In 1909 Robert graduated from Ogallala High School received his bachelor's degree from Doane College in Crete in 1913 then attended the Omaha Horological Institute.

While still a student at Doane Robert obtained an electrician’s license and after completing the year-long Omaha course in only four months went to work at Jonathan Lucas’ jewelry store in Ogallala.

Scarcely a year later Robert purchased the store and began experimenting and inventing in the backroom. Within a short time he had perfected an electric watch and clock cleaning machine and a new type of soldering iron for detailed work. It is unclear exactly when the retail jewelry store closed but in 1927 Robert invented a non-synchronized talking machine designed to adapt silent films to sound. By the following year he had developed a commercial welder a walking lawn sprinkler a “cold light” for use by physicians and dentists and expanded into the area of sound equipment for movie theaters.

By World War II Goodall Electric Co. had not only introduced a spin casting fishing reel but with nearly 1000 employees at a point where Ogallala’s entire population was less than 3000 developed a new electrical rectifier and capacitor which he sold to the U.S. Navy for proximity fuses.

The company name changed slightly in 1944 to the Good-All Manufacturing Company and advertised “Good-All’s Goods are Always Good.” In businesses only tangentially related Robert had interests in oil and owned motion picture theaters in Grant Lyman North Platte Ong and Sutherland.

By the early 1950s Good-All’s major capacitor customer became Eastman Kodak. In 1953 Robert and Clarice donated the old American Legion building to the city becoming the Goodall Public Library. Later in 1953 Robert died leaving Clarice not only the beneficiary of the businesses but as “the first woman president of an oil company in the United States.” A separate corporation Ogallala Electronics began producing foil coils in 1961 and resumed making rectifiers in 1964.

The business was still healthy in 1984 when the sale of capacitors alone reached $8840000 but in that year Clarice Goodall died at the age of 93. At that point the Goodall family had donated the Goodall Science Building at Doane College the Redfern Boys' Ranch the Goodall Recreation Center in Ogallala and the city’s Goodall Public Library.

In 1987 most of the corporation was sold to TRW (Thompson-Ramo-Wooldridge) with the capacitor division ending up as Shizuki Electronics. The family name lives on as the Goodall Recreation Center and Goodall Drive in Ogallala but the Goodall Public Library at 203 W. A St. has been replaced by the Kathleen Lute Library.

The prime minister in a tweet on Friday described the launching of TTS by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) as more good news.

“It will boost additional revenue digitise the economy curb counterfeiting — all steps towards effective and transparent governance system” he maintained.

Earlier in the day Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin inaugurated the much-awaited TTS at the Pakistan Tobacco Company (PTC) Jhelum.

FBR chairman Ashfaq Ahmed along with Member Inland Revenue (Operations) Qaiser Iqbal TTS Project Director Tariq Sheikh and PTC CEO Ali Khan attended the meeting.

Tarin praises FBR for rolling out the project for tobacco sector

At the outset Mr Tarin praised the FBR for rolling out this significant project for the tobacco sector which would help prevent leakage of revenue under-reporting of production and sales of tobacco products and ensure proper payment of federal excise duty (FED) and sales tax on the manufacture and sale of the products.

The FBR is also preparing to implement TTS in sugar fertiliser and cement sectors in the near future.

“TTS is a very comprehensive and robust electronic monitoring system which is a paradigm shift from a conventional physical monitoring system. It is believed that installation of the TTS in the notified sectors would be a game-changer for improving revenue and curbing counterfeit products in the market” Mr Tarin said.

Mr Tarin said in an official announcement that it was heartening to see that the FBR had successfully issued a license and subsequently signed a contract with AJCL/Mittas/Authentix Consortium for installation of TTS on March 5 2021.

This system is to be developed operated and maintained by the licensee for notified sectors including tobacco products manufactured in and imported into Pakistan. For this purpose the FBR was striving hard to implement the system for past 12 years but unfortunately it resulted in five unsuccessful attempts. However in its sixth attempt the FBR has procured one of the best TTS available after strenuous efforts of over a decade.

Mr Tarin said: “Our prime objective was to take the tax-to-GDP ratio to 20 per cent in coming years which currently stood at 8-12pc.” He surmised that currently tax evasion of Rs70 billion was being done in the tobacco sector which made 37pc of market share.

The finance minister also stated that the Economic Advisory Council had been directed to identify more sectors where the TTS could be installed to increase revenue.

FBR Chairman Ashfaq Ahmed said that electronic monitoring of common-use products right from the entry-point into the supply chain that is production or import till the exit-point that is purchase by end-consumer — broadly referred to as TTS — is being viewed as a watershed development in maximising revenue potential in the notified sectors.

“TTS entails application of Unique Identification Marks (UIMs) or Tax Stamps carrying covert semi-covert overt forensic and digital features enabling electronic traceability of goods across the supply chain” he added.

He said that the UIMs applied on industrial products would help identify isolate and curb the production supply and movement of untaxed counterfeit and smuggled goods thereby strengthening governance and rule of law in Pakistan.

“Presently TTS is used in over 80 countries to apply about 10 trillion UIMs on various products across the globe” he added.

Mr Ahmed reaffirmed that this system would be further strengthened by vigilant efficient and fully equipped Inland Revenue Enforcement Network (IREN) and the federal government had already allocated Rs435 million for the purchase of vehicles state-of-the-art equipment and latest technology-driven gadgets for the enforcement network.

“The IREN will be able to combat evasion and leakages of taxes and duties payable on notified goods through the Enforcement Squads that shall patrol the designated routes on which specified goods are moving and check a vehicle or any place of storage wherein reportedly such specified goods are being transported stored or kept” he explained.

The first large commercial redevelopment has been completed at the site of Phoenix’s former Metrocenter Mall.

The former JCPenney store once filled with clothes appliances and other household items can now hold wine boats and RVs.

Denver-based Southwestern Property bought the former anchor store and turned it into a climate-controlled Life Storage facility. The 157000-square-foot building offers small lockers storage units and parking spaces.

Cecelia Martinez The JCPenney store at the former Metrocenter Mall in Phoenix was converted to a climate-controlled self-storage facility in September 2021.

In June 2019 the property manager for Metrocenter Mall Capital Asset Management was hopeful the mall could become a sports and entertainment hub.

Metrocenter Mall officially closed in June 2020 but the JCP store which was not part of mall ownership had closed earlier.

When Metrocenter opened in 1973 it was Arizona’s first two story mall and attracted shoppers from across the region. It was believed to be the first mall west of the Mississippi River to have five department stores.

It’s the second recent redevelopment for big box stores around Metrocenter.

Some may wonder exactly what performance differences exist between the two chipsets; answers are thankfully here.

Qualcomm released the Snapdragon 780G at the start of the year. For some reason however the Snapdragon 780G only ever found use on one phone Xiaomi's Mi 11 Lite 5G. Instead Qualcomm has replaced the chipset with the 6nm Snapdragon 778G. That SoC has now found wide application in the mid-range and sub-premium segments essentially sharing a space with MediaTek's Dimensity 1200. But how do those two compare to each other?

Starting off with Geekbench the MediaTek Dimensity 1200 hits hard with a score of 809. In comparison the Snapdragon 778G comes away with a single-core score of 771. In the multi-core tests the MediaTek chipset earns a score of 2463; the Snapdragon 778G records 2808. That's turning out to be a trend with MediaTek chipsets recently—better peak performance while lagging a bit behind in the multi-core segment. Those numbers translate to a 5% advantage to the Dimensity 1200 in the single-core test and a 14% disadvantage in the multi-core test.

The Snapdragon 778G crushes the Dimensity 1200 on PCMark Work 3.0 as well with a score of 12265 versus the MediaTek chipset's 8486. Interestingly though the Dimensity 1200 does better on AnTuTu's CPU test scoring 173352—about 7% better than the Snapdragon 778G's 161328. This just indicates that AnTuTu favors single-core performance with the Dimensity 1200 having an edge due to its higher-clocked Cortex A78 core (3.0 GHz vs 2.4 GHz)

Moving over to the GPU side of the fence the Dimensity 1200 and its Mali G77 records 58 fps in GFX 3.1's Manhattan ES Off-Screen test. The Snapdragon 778G and its Adreno 642 lag behind at 49 fps or about a 24% disadvantage. Those numbers are mirrored on AnTuTu's GPU test where the Dimensity 1200 (232145) destroys the Snapdragon 778G (156405)—a huge 48% advantage to the MediaTek chipset. 3DMark's WildLife Unlimited offers similar conclusions with the Dimensity 1200 scoring 4214 points versus the Snapdragon 778G's 2485.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9NZWRpYVRlay1pcy1mb3VuZC10by1oYXZlLXRha2VuLWl0cy1iaWdnZXN0LXNoYXJlLW9mLXRoZS1tb2JpbGUtU29DLW1hcmtldC1ldmVyLWZvci10aGUtc2Vjb25kLXF1YXJ0ZXItb2YtMjAyMS41Njg2MDUuMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MediaTek is found to have taken its biggest share of the mobile SoC market ever for the second quarter of 2021,"Counterpoint Research has announced the results of its analysis of the smartphone processor market during the second quarter of 2021 (2Q2021). They indicate that MediaTek ""dominated"" the space for those 3 months taking a share of over 40% for the first time. On the other hand Qualcomm did well out of the 5G baseband sector thanks to iPhone sales.

Counterpoint Research has now released its latest (August 2021) market-tracking report for the smartphone SoC (encompassing 5G baseband chipsets as well as application processors). It covers the second quarter of this year (2Q021) and indicates that MediaTek is proving earlier projections of unparalleled success in the same 12 months true thus far.

The Taiwanese company has posted a 43% share of this market up from 37% in 1Q2021 and 28% in the same quarter of 2020. Qualcomm came in second at 28% (or 4% less year-on-year (YoY)) with Apple in third with a flat YoY share of 14%.

The Cupertino giant was followed by a perhaps surprising entrant in 4th place: Unisoc which grew its share by 5% YoY to 9% thus taking the spot occupied by Samsung in 2Q2020. The South Korean's decline to 7% from (12% last year) looks better compared to that of HiSilicon however.

Huawei's mobile chipset-specific divison had a 16% share in 2Q2020; however it has dwindled to 3% in this latest report. MediaTek's happier results were attributed to the presence of its SoCs in the low- to mid-range 5G smartphone market although it is still doing business in the 4G/LTE space at present.

Nevertheless Qualcomm led the 5G baseband sector in 2Q2021 with a 55% share compared to 29% the previous year. Counterpoint also found that this OEM was generally more exposed to the ongoing supply-chain crisis than MediaTek for the latest quarter.

However the US company has responded by distributing more orders among a number of additional foundries (TSMC for example). These measures might pay off for Qualcomm in subsequent quarters as they may result in that many more chipsets it can ship in the near future.

HMD Global reportedly has a new budget 5G phone in the works. The upcoming Nokia G300 (a big jump in the new naming scheme) is a run-of-the-mill G series smartphone running the same chip as the still-recent Nokia G50. In typical Nokia fashion the G300 doesn't rock the most competitive specs on the market.





Courtesy of the publication NokiaPowerUser we learn the detailed specifications for the phone. The engine inside the Nokia G300 5G is the Snapdragon 480 processor. It's powered by a 4470mAh battery presumably without quick power delivery support. Nokia promises 14 hours of talk time out of a single charge.

Flip the phone over to find an unoriginal ring-shaped housing. Three lenses and an LED flash are embedded in this island.







For the specs the screen is an underwhelming 6.5"" TFT LCD. The lack of an IPS display makes for poor viewing angles and contrast ratio. Unsurprisingly it caps out at a 720P resolution.

It has lost its lead in the chip market to rivals who have overtaken it in both mobile and artificial intelligence and have figured out Intel’s sophisticated production methods. It has suffered ongoing CEO churn employee defection to competitors and criticism about a closed-off corporate culture. The share trails competitors like Nvidia and Qualcomm - even though Intel has more sales than any of them.

At the same time the US semiconductor giant is intensifying its hold on the Israeli technology industry. Its total chip exports from Israel last year reached an all-time high of $8 billion - double that of just six years ago - despite concerns among workers that the local plant’s expansion would be delayed under former CEO Bob Swan. Out of total tech exports Intel accounted for no less than 14% another record and at a time when Israeli tech is at a peak. Intel has also been critical to domestic product at a record rate of about 2%.

This is a reciprocal relationship. Intel's Israeli operations are at the heart of its recovery strategy. New CEO Pat Gelsinger who was appointed at the beginning of this year wants to bring Intel back to its heyday. Gelsinger has outlined the areas where Intel’s Israeli centers have an inherent advantage: computer and server chips fields led by Intel Haifa in the 1990s and early 2000s; artificial intelligence (AI) chips and automotive chips through massive investment in Habana Labs in Caesarea and Mobileye in Jerusalem; and reentering the competition for Israeli engineers who in the interim have been in fierce demand by giants like Amazon Nvidia and Facebook and young semiconductor startups.

How did the PC revolution flagship become a company forced to reinvent itself? Veteran staffers from Intel and other chip giants have some answers. Some see Intel's 'original sin' as not having identified the mobile revolution in time others think it fumbled the AI market and still others blame the management style of former CEO Brian Krzanich.

Missing out on the mobile revolution

Mobile chips have long outstripped computers and servers in terms of market size. Some believe that Intel's failure to identify the revolution served this sector on a silver platter to competitors like Qualcomm Samsung and TSMC.

In the mid-2000s Apple CEO Steve Jobs asked then-Intel CEO Paul Otellini to provide chips for the first iPhone. But Otellini thought the offer was too low and that adapting Intel's high-performance CPU to small phones would require a lot of effort. Jobs then turned to Samsung and the rest is history. A few years later Apple began to develop its own chips with production at the TSMC factory in Taiwan that competes head-to-head with Intel. Ironically the person who oversees all of Apple's semiconductor operations is Johny Srouji formerly of Intel Haifa.

Intel has made several failed attempts to gain a foothold in the smartphone market. It acquired Infineon’s mobile chip division for $1.4 billion and invested capital on customers like LG for them to make devices based on its chip. Nonetheless Qualcomm has maintained its lead. Intel’s preference has been computer and server chips - with sophisticated performance capabilities - over mobile chips where compromises must be made to extend battery life.

""Nvidia did an Intel on Intel""

AI and machine learning was another missed opportunity. Once perceived as a small niche market for robotics or computer game developers today these clearly form the infrastructure for countless fields including cybersecurity automotive smart speakers virtual reality and more.

""Artificial intelligence is ubiquitous today and Intel hasn’t devoted enough time and thought to the matter ""a former senior executive at the company tells ""Globes."" ""It was a gaming company Nvidia that developed the field. Up until then it was known as a graphics processing unit (GPU) developer for gamers who wanted to optimize their hardware to support high-performance computer games. Nvidia’s value soared on the strength of that achievement and today its market cap is double that of Intel even though Intel sells a lot more chips.""

Thanks to the software layer developed for its CUDA GPU Nvidia has become a monopoly holding 81% of the AI processor market according to research firm Omdia. Despite competition from higher quality chips designed by companies like Google AMD Xilinx and even Intel itself Nvidia continued to benefit from its supremacy in the market thanks to its proprietary software environment. ""Engineers won’t want to learn a new software language just to work with Intel hardware"" the former senior executive tells ""Globes."" ""Nvidia did to Intel what Intel had done to the world with its software monopoly that worked only on its own x86 microprocessor that unquestionably dominated the desktop laptop and server markets for years. In other words Nvidia did an Intel on Intel to beat it in the future.""

Intel can no longer be changed by fax

As mentioned some attribute the company's current situation to Krzanich’s management style. Krzanich who served as CEO from 2013 to 2018 was known for overreacting to criticism and strident arguments that sometimes devolved into ridicule and humiliation of others. The result: overlooked problems on the production line postponements delays and missed opportunities. During his tenure for the first time Intel failed in what it had always known how to do better than anyone else throughout its history: launch the most technologically advanced chips.

Intel was the first to launch a 14-nanometer production line in 2015 but the launch of its next technology 10-nanometers was delayed first by six months and then by three years with ramifications for the Kiryat Gat fab. The delay not only caused a great deal of embarrassment it also caused Dell one of Intel's major customers to cut its sales forecast by $1 billion last year according to research by Bloomberg. Those junior engineers who warned Krzanich were ignored.

In his new book Molikhim l’Hatzlakha ""Conducting to Success"" David ""Dadi"" Perlmutter the most senior Israeli ever to serve at Intel (as EVP and General Manager of the Intel Architecture Group and Chief Product Officer) tells of a time when the organizational culture was bottom-up. In 1992 junior employees in Israel sent a fax to CEO Andy Grove that changed the company's destiny. Perlmutter and two other engineers wanted to maintain good relations with Microsoft and did not want to rewrite the CPU’s core software. The move planned by the management they cautioned could harm the applications environment already developed on top of the Intel layer and thus harm its competitive advantage.

""The bottom line is that this fax resulted in the Pentium processor which changed the personal computing world by turning every IBM-compatible PC into a product found in every home"" writes Perlmutter (who refused comment for this article).

Krzanich’s term was eventually marked by a wave of departures of executives that included Perlmutter. Roni Friedman who led the development of the advanced PC semiconductors left for Apple. Shlomit Weiss who was general manager of the Data Center Group Silicon Development went to rival Nvidia; she recently returned to Intel as Senior Vice President and Co-General Manager of the Design Engineering group. A host of other VPs and senior executives at Intel's Santa Clara headquarters also resigned.

But it is possible that Krzanich’s appointment was only a symptom and not the cause. As one former Intel executive put it: ""You don’t get a heart attack in a day it’s the result of decades of unhealthy nutrition. The mobile division has suffered from a lack of investment for decades. Even a legend like Andy Grove decided not to invest there even though the first processor Nokia ever used was the famous 386 by Intel.""

Another former executive tells ""Globes"" that ""Intel was blinded by success. It refused to see what its competitors were seeing and in retrospect the CEOs it appointed in the last few decades made it a different company. It started out as a group of entrepreneurs with PhDs in engineering and chemistry but over the past 20 years it’s appointed CEOs from manufacturing or finance. These people had technical or financial understanding but no vision.""

Empires fall slowly

The loss of its advantage in manufacturing development and design of new chips has taken a toll on Intel’s prestige and market value. The considerable price gap between Intel’s share lagging far behind Nvidia and AMD has only widened since the outbreak of the Covid-19 global pandemic.

Nvidia as mentioned has become the AI chip market leader. It is also gaining the lead in the data center market with its super-processing GPU and is expected to acquire ARM an intellectual property (IP) titan for low-power CPUs.

At the same time AMD is nipping at Intel’s heels in chips for the home market desktops and laptops and has even overtaken it technologically with a more advanced generation (7-nanometers). Market experts believe that AMD’s new server chips outperform Intel’s and threaten its market hegemony.

Meanwhile tech giants including Google and Facebook are in the process of setting up chip development departments for their data centers and additional electronic products. Only a few months ago Uri Frank who was GM of Intel’s Core & Client Development Group moved to manage hardware development as VP Engineering at Google. Project manager Ofer Weissman today holds a similar position on Facebook and there are others.

In manufacturing too Intel lost the lead to TSMC which has overtaken it with advanced technologies. The Taiwanese giant has launched chips fabricated using 7- and 10-nanometer technology and is preparing to launch 3-nanometer chips next year. Meanwhile Intel is struggling to open 7-nanometer fabs with plans for a 4-nanometer factory in Arizona in a few years. TSMC grew under its partnership with Apple and now serves almost all chip developers without their own production facilities including Amazon Nvidia Qualcomm Broadcom and AMD. Apple has already unveiled its strategy to jettison Intel in favor of a range of new Mac chips manufactured by TSMC.

""Pentium Pat"" to the rescue

The half-dozen former Intel executives interviewed by ""Globes"" were unanimous: appointing new CEO Pat Gelsinger is a brilliant move. The right man at the right time. A symbol of the Intel of yesteryear. A protégé of legendary CEO Andy Grove in his first post-graduate job Gelsinger learned professional management tempered with humility. He is a technologist who was Intel's first VP technology. He then served as CEO at VMware as president and VP operations at EMC and at additional software companies where he experienced corporate cultures other than Intel. He is passionate about restoring Intel’s dominance in chip manufacture to the West chiefly the US.

In the Israeli context Gelsinger's appointment is good news too. Gelsinger gave his imprimatur to Intel's biggest brand of the 1980s the 486 chip. He advanced the next generation the Pentium whose development group included a great number of Israelis. Managers in Israel who knew him then still call him ""Pentium Pat."" During his tenure EMC and VMware expanded their operations in Israel and made local acquisitions.

As mentioned a large part of Intel's rehabilitation strategy depends on Israel: chips and components for AI automotive servers and PCs. Small wonder that Gelsinger visited Israel recently announcing his intention to recruit a thousand workers and open another development center. But unlike Krzanich Gelsinger understands Intel's limits knows where to invest and where to concede.

Last month Intel workers in Israel had a front-row seat to the company’s cutbacks. Smaller acquisitions made in Israel dealing in areas that have always been considered trivial and not part of Intel’s core activity - like sports imaging developer Replay Technologies and 3D sensor printed circuit board developer InVision Biometrics - were swiftly shut down by Gelsinger.

Giving up privilege - Focusing on the main thing

He is also willing to give up Intel’s privilege transferring manufacturing of the company's less significant chips to competitors like TSMC and repositioning Intel as a third-party manufacturer that will produce for others including the competition in addition to itself. This latest move achieves a principle coined by the legendary Andy Grove: ""Intel has one goal: our plants must always run at full capacity because a plant that doesn’t utilize 100% of its capabilities is a losing enterprise.""

At the same time Gelsinger will invest $100 billion in the construction and upgrade of new plants of which $20 billion this year is for construction of two new factories in Arizona and $3.5 billion to upgrade the New Mexico plant. It also sets into motion plans for the new Kiryat Gat fab which was delayed under former CEO Swan a $10 billion investment of which $4 billion are government grants. The new plant is expected to be operational in 2024.

Gelsinger has his sights set on Europe and has stated that Intel intends to spend about $100 billion on plants in Europe (assumed to be in Ireland Germany or Poland) including fabs for automotive chips designed in Israel. The goal is to return Intel to the forefront of global chip production using Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) - a technology that prints circuits thinner than a single hair. Intel is also examining a new business model that will enable it to compete with Apple partner ARM and sell its chip IP including to competitors.

By 2025 the company intends to launch the 18A chip whose electrical circuits are measured not in nanometers the currently accepted standard but in Angstrom (one-tenth of a nanometer). Intel not alone: TSMC has already announced that it will invest a similar amount in new plants in Taiwan Korea China and even near Intel’s Arizona factory.

In doing so Intel hopes to restore the glory days of its founder Gordon Moore whose Moore's Law predicted that the density of transistors in integrated circuits would double every year and a half to two years without increasing production costs. He assumed - and rightly so - that Intel would succeed in minimizing the size of its electronic circuits for each subsequent generation. That held true at least until the company began missing out allowing the Asian manufacturers to get around it.

Gelsinger plans to invest tens of billions more acquiring another chipmaker with GlobalFoundries reportedly the target. The $30 billion company an Intel competitor owned by a UAE-based fund manufactures chips in Europe. GlobalFoundries is currently indicating it is not interested in an acquisition and prefers going public instead.

Intel’s surprising geopolitical role

Two trends - economic and geopolitical - play in Intel’s favor increasing the West’s dependence on it and giving it a role it never dreamed it would take on. Intel may be the Western world’s last chipmaker a kind of ""Silicon Curtain"" should China invade Taiwan - which today seems more likely than ever before. Intel also benefits from the current chip market shortage where every manufacturer is critical to the continued production of vehicles phones and laptops.

Intel is encouraged by the huge demand for electronics and computer products that intensified with the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic which kept hundreds of millions of people at home. The company estimates this huge demand will increase a thousand-fold within four years - equaling Moore's Law times five.

This new spirit has brought senior executives back: Shlomit Weiss returned from Nvidia to co-manage the Design Engineering group alongside US-based Sunil Shenoy another leaver who returned as Senior VP. ""Gelsinger can be unusually aggressive and he won’t keep the company the way it is today"" a senior executive familiar with Gelsinger tells ""Globes."" ""He's a man of decision and action - which is how he can save it or kill it. It's intriguing to see which way Intel will go with him.""

The challenges for Intel Israel

Intel Israel in the Gelsinger era faces a dual challenge: reviving the corporate culture to make it once again the market’s most attractive employer and fulfilling an increasingly significant role in server and AI chips the strategic markets targeted by Intel HQ.

Although its workforce is gradually increasing Intel actually declined in the Israeli perception as an attractive place to work. In the BDiCode Best Companies to Work For list the company moved down the top ten ranking for 2019 and 2020 after many years of vying with Google for top spot.

The Intel employee profile has also changed. One senior chip development manager who hires hardware engineers [name withheld by request] says that Intel used to attract the best elite university graduates year after year with outstanding engineers traveling daily to Haifa from Tel Aviv and the central region.

Today he says long-standing employees are leaving Intel equipped with specific narrow expertise and without the tools to help them integrate into other companies. ""What people have absorbed there over 10-15 years doesn’t really match what can be absorbed at other companies for that time"" he says. Seniority among Intel employees for better or worse is also reflected in the data: According to LinkedIn Intel employees have a median seniority of 6.1 years the highest compared to its competitors; median seniority at Nvidia is 3.6 years and 3.3 years at Apple.

""There's a veteran ethos there folks who worked at Oregon HQ and 'lugged their transistors on their backs' - as they say in the lunchroom - tough quality engineers not like their competitors at Qualcomm who just know how to send an email to TSMC"" says one industry executive well-acquainted with the Intel workforce. ""But the sheer size of the company sometimes makes it difficult to move quickly and when one division head gets replaced by another it's like a body that’s had its head replaced.""

Intel has also suffered in recent years from employee attrition in favor of its rivals. Apparently the number of new employees has stagnated in the last two years.

Intel's makeover

The Gelsinger era indeed cut Intel's peripheral activities in Israel with more waves of cutbacks expected to rock the company in the near future. But Intel recruitment executives along with employees who know the company from the inside report a recent reversal in trend. ""Intel has begun battling to retain good employees and hermetically seal the talent drain. Likewise their proposed salaries to new hires are highly competitive."" One example obtained by ""Globes"" proposes a salary signing fee and bonus comparable to Amazon or Apple. In late August Intel recruited a senior hardware architect from Apple Israel.

Intel has hired about 1000 development workers this year and is still hiring staff for about 400 vacancies. Among the largest groups hired: server cloud and communications and a new AI driven WiFi group. Another new group formed to compete with Mellanox in data center processors is managed by Ilan Avital VP Engineering Network and Edge Group.

An employee familiar with Intel's hiring policy tells ""Globes"" that among potential recruits Intel has a very good image regarding work-life balance. ""Apple pays well but is considered a very rigid workplace without a good balance between leisure and work and work is a small part of Apple's hardware especially in communications"" he says. ""Amazon pays great but in the end you're a small cog in the machine without global impact. Anyone who goes to work at Google's hardware division in Israel deals with a very narrow aspect of cloud CPUs. Life at Intel is much more comfortable with a good balance between leisure family and work. Engineers can work on big projects and affect processor development in countless areas: PCs servers and AI.""

""Willenz and Shashua stood their ground""

Intel needed to change its approach to acquisitions well. To date Intel has closed or sold many of its Israeli acquisitions including Replay Technologies RealSense Oplus Technologies and DSPC. ""Their method was similar"" says a former Intel executive. ""The day after the acquisition all employees underwent a series of training sessions about Intel and its organization culture their work systems were replaced and ultimately they were put into uniform Intel cubicles. Then for months they’d ask themselves how they could maintain the same level of output they’d had before Intel acquired them. That’s why Amnon Shashua of Mobileye and Avigdor Willenz of Habana Labs stood their ground about maintaining their companies’ independence at least for the first few years.""

Habana Labs is a key asset for Intel - and the success of its Caesarea operations will greatly impact Gelsinger's AI strategy versus giants like Nvidia and AMD. As mentioned Intel entered the machine learning sector by acquiring the AI chip developer in late 2019. The deal was considered ‘Too little too late’ and very costly. Habana has not yet launched a product and it will take time for Intel to integrate the technology into its server motherboards. But Habana’s expanding collaboration and possible acquisition by Facebook led Intel to make a $2 billion takeover bid rather a high sum for a company with no sales. It may be that taking veteran chipmaker Avigdor Willenz - the man behind a number of chip companies sold to giants like Amazon and Marvell - and turning him into a one-day-a-week Intel employee and AI consultant was worth it.

Habana’s technology is different to Intel’s as its chips are based on the competing ARM technology but Intel believes that incorporating its Xeon server chips into any board with a Habana chip can accelerate data center activity. The data center sector and the move to the cloud in general has become the biggest competitive arena between Intel Nvidia and even rival AMD. Intel market’s share has been damaged by Nvidia which offers AI processors and GPUs that help accelerate all data center network communications and deliver higher capabilities. It’s possible that to regain market share Intel will continue to make Israeli acquisitions in the data center sector and benefit from the growing number of startups in this industry such as Pliops or Hailo Technologies by acquiring one or two.

Deliver the goods or pay the price

Recognizing Intel's past failures in mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) chips Gelsinger wants to take Intel back to its halcyon days of high-performance complex computing chips and focus on high-power PC and server chips that demand higher capacity and far higher performance than mobile phone chips. This division which is responsible for $40 billion in annual revenue is retaking center stage with an Israeli management team that includes Shlomit Weiss SVP and co-GM of Design Engineering; Ran Berenson VP and GM of the Core and Client Development group; and Adi Yoaz Core CPU Chief Architect of Intel's new Alder-Lake chip.

Mobileye remains a sort of island within Intel: Amnon Shashua and his executives run it independently and decide for themselves the way Mobileye will wear the Intel team colors. Although its revenue is only a small slice of Intel's revenue at ""just"" $1 billion per year Gelsinger views Mobileye as Intel's future in the smart vehicle semiconductor market and its foothold in the automotive world. Intel estimates that the vehicle chip market will account for about one-fifth of all premium car components by 2030 and will account for about one-tenth of the global chip market. Intel which is the only company among its competitors to own an automotive chip company has the chance to dominate this field to the benefit of its Jerusalem development center. Although autonomous vehicles are still far from being commercially available next year Intel together with Mobileye will launch an experimental autonomous taxi fleet branded under the Moovit app that will manage ride-hailing services.

Will Intel Israel eventually grow during the Gelsinger era? It all depends on Intel Israel. ""Pat has known Intel Israel for decades and appreciates its contribution but if there’s one thing you can say about his management style it’s that he’s a cool calculated CEO who as we all saw recently knows where to cut and where not to"" says one former Intel executive. ""If Israel doesn’t deliver the goods it will pay the price.""

Despite the announcement about building a new fab in Israel and recruiting hundreds of workers Intel Israel will face increasing challenges in the coming years. Europe today at the far end of the semiconductor industry is making huge efforts to attract chip giants and the US government is ramping up investments targeted at bringing chip manufacturing back to the US. All could affect Intel’s local activity. Israel is on the right side of the ""Silicon Curtain"" and its leanings towards the US or China in the coming years are also likely to impact Intel's preference.

A new national study published online this week in JAMA Pediatrics estimates that 82% of Missouri children under the age of 6 and 65% of Kansas children in that age range have detectable levels of lead in their blood.

Health experts have generally measured exposure through elevated blood-lead levels which can cause development and learning delays in children. But the study's authors say that children's health can be at risk even at the lower levels in their findings.

“The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization both state there is no lower limit — there is no safe level of lead for children” said study author Dr. Harvey Kaufman of Quest Diagnostics.

Only Nebraska had a higher percentage than Missouri of children with detectable blood lead levels.

Children in the U.S. are often exposed to lead within their homes through contact with old paint or pipes. The researchers found that lead in blood is more commonly found among children from lower-income households and who live in predominately Black non-Hispanic neighborhoods.

The study also showed that 4.5% of young Missouri children and 2.6% of young Kansas children had elevated blood lead levels.

The benchmark for elevated blood-lead levels was established by the CDC but was lowered in 2012 after experts stated that lead is not safe in any amount.

Kaufman acknowledges that the detrimental effects of lower blood-lead levels found in the study have not been proven as significant as elevated levels but he thinks the potential risks should be cause for concern.

Children’s Mercy Hospital medical director of environmental health Dr. Elizabeth Friedman agrees saying that low levels of lead can lead to behavioral developmental or learning difficulties.

“There’s evidence for harm even at really low levels of lead exposure” Friedman says.

The study involved researchers from Boston Children’s Hospital Quest Diagnostics and the University of Miami and included data taken from lab testing of over 1 million children under 6 years of age in every state from 2018 to early 2020.

After about 20 minutes police said two of the suspects tried to leave the store but were confronted by a lone store employee. One suspect then pulled a handgun and pointed it at the staff member before leaving the store with the third suspect.

All three suspects were seen fleeing the scene in a light blue Honda CRV with no license plates and heading north of Interstate 5.

Police confirmed that the suspects stole items from the store but did not specify what they took.

The armed suspect was described as a Hispanic or like-skinned African-American between 5-feet-4 and 5-feet-6 with a thin build. He was wearing red joggers a black Patagonia hoodie surgical face mask black beanie and black tennis shoes. He also had a heart-shaped or teardrop tattoo on his left cheek under his eye.

With 139 yards and two touchdowns he stood at the forefront of the offense.

The next two games were different.

Three catches in a Week 2 win. Three catches in a Week 3 win. Within the team’s facility Cooper moved to the forefront of something deeper as coaches and teammates observed a trend.

When wide receiver CeeDee Lamb vaulted for a 44-yard catch near the goal line last Monday against the Philadelphia Eagles Cooper was spotted 25 yards away his index finger pointed to the sky before Lamb left the ground to secure the catch. When Lamb celebrated Cooper ran downfield as the first to join him.

These images of him and others supporting teammates recurred play after play.

“I’ve played on some good teams with some great people in there but this is by far the most unselfish group there is” quarterback Dak Prescott said. “You see the way Coop celebrates when CeeDee catches the big bomb early in the game and the excitement they have. And it’s true. It’s not just on game day but it’s day in and day out at practice. It’s those receivers going and digging out the safeties for the run game to get going.

“It’s impressive and it’s the reason that we’re having success and it’ll be the reason that we continue to.”

The Cowboys have averaged 30 points per game this season while adapting their game plans to capitalize on how defenses attack them. Naturally this approach leads to inconsistent statistical production for individuals. That hasn’t created any locker-room tension entering Sunday against the Carolina Panthers.

Offensive coordinator Kellen Moore’s focus is winning.

He hasn’t needed to concern himself with how to keep running back Ezekiel Elliott happy when giving Tony Pollard an entire series of playing time or higher concentration of touches at different stages of games. Elliott appreciates Pollard’s strengths and understand that it’s a 17-game season.

Dalton Schultz has garnered more receiving targets than Blake Jarwin in two of three games. But the tight ends are close friends who by all indications treat each other’s wins like his own.

The same goes at wide receiver where Cooper is the offense’s highest-paid non-quarterback and wants to earn recognition as one of the NFL’s premiere players at his position. He needs numbers to earn that notoriety.

If having to choose Cooper prefers wins.

All this selfless camaraderie might sound campy or even inconsequential. But Prescott believes it’s a differentiator and an example of what a winning culture looks and feels like. He believes the shared attitude only helps when the Cowboys face a challenging test like the one on Sunday.

All hands are on deck. All players can do their part whatever it may be.

“We don’t have an ego” Prescott said. “We don’t have it individually but we’ve allowed it to come together and to be one ego one ego as this offense. It’s special. All those guys are special players but they’re special men with great attitudes. I think that’s the great underlying factor in all this.”

Carolina has allowed an NFC-low 30 points in three games. Its blitz package under defensive coordinator Phil Snow is highly aggressive targeting not only the passer but the running game. The Panthers have shown fewer two-high safety looks in coverage this season than the Cowboys’ previous two opponents the Eagles and Los Angeles Chargers.

That could mean opportunities for Cooper Lamb and the passing game.

Prescott threw 58 passes in the first game and 53 the next two combined.

“Hey we want everyone getting opportunities” Moore said. “We want to spread this ball around as much as we can. At the end of the day also we know there’s going to be ebbs and flows of games. Some guys maybe don’t get as many touches as we had anticipated. But we kind of talked about it: This is where our offense is at and really our whole team just the unselfishness.

“We understand this is a long season. Someone may have a big game today and that’s going to open up something next week for another guy.”

Cooper said Thursday he had “no problem” with his limited touches Monday. After all he said the Cowboys won by 20 points.

His lack of touches also shouldn’t be confused as a lack of involvement.

He attracted the attention from a safety on multiple occasions to create opportunities for teammates including on the 44-yard Lamb reception and a 19-yard Schultz touchdown. Those are the sort of contributions that don’t appear on stat sheets or win fantasy leagues.

Cooper is not complaining.

Teammates notice. Coaches notice. The scoreboard notices.

“I mean what did Amari have in the game?” Schultz said. “I don’t even know. … The guy can go off for 15 catches in a game if he wants to. The guy has a quiet game. Every time somebody else scored he was the first one to him. Nobody cares who gets the credit and I think that’s one of the good things an offense can have is when nobody cares who gets the credit. It’s all about the outcome.”

FOXBOROUGH Mass. (AP) — Tom Brady’s legacy is forever steeped in each of the six Super Bowl championship banners he had a part in hanging above New England’s Gillette Stadium.

Yet he might as well be playing in front of a mirror when he returns to face the Patriots.

Everything will be in reverse.

“I know that home locker room. I know that home tunnel. I know which way the wind blows. I know everything about that” Brady said this week. “So in some ways it’ll be unique. I’ve never had that experience. New England will be the first time for me being on the other sideline.”

Brady will be back in Foxborough on Sunday night to meet the Patriots for the first time since he left after 20 seasons to join the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He’ll be opposite not only former coach Bill Belichick but past teammates who have also never taken an NFL field and looked across at Brady wearing another team’s jersey let alone ever had a chance to tackle him.

“The opportunity is wonderful and I’m looking forward for the moment” Patriots defensive end Deatrich Wise Jr. said.

While they all have played against former teammates before the Patriots acknowledge this time is much different. None of those other players has the institutional knowledge Brady does of their defensive schemes or tendencies.

It makes the margin for error minute against a quarterback who is a master at getting the ball out quickly and reading and deceiving defenses with his eyes.

“It’s gonna be a guy that he’s gonna know a lot of what we do” said veteran safety Devin McCourty who won three Super Bowls with Brady. “So what we do we’ve gotta do a good job of. We have to play our best football.”

This 44-year-old version of Brady is still playing at a high level after taking the Bucs to a Super Bowl title last season. He leads the league this season with 10 touchdown passes and his 362.3 passing yards per game are second to Las Vegas’ Derek Carr.

Tampa Bay’s 34.3 points per game are also tied for tops in the NFL thanks largely to one of the most stacked offenses in the league that includes receivers Chris Godwin and Mike Evans.

“This is one of those weeks where we can’t have a bunch of ‘my bads’” McCourty said. “We gotta be on.”

At least New England won’t have to worry about Rob Gronkowski another old friend. The tight end who teamed with Brady on so many big plays over the years with the Patriots is out because of a rib injury.

As much as Brady knows the Patriots they also know him. But Belichick 8-11 since Brady’s departure said it doesn’t mean they will reinvent themselves this week.

“Certainly Tom has an intimate knowledge of everything that we do here more so than any other player in the league by far. So I’m sure he’ll use it to his advantage. I would expect him to” Belichick said. “I don’t think it would be in our best interest to go in there and do everything differently than we’ve done it all year. What we need to do is continue to do the things we do and do them better. That would help us more than anything else.”

ELITE CLUB

A victory would make Brady the fourth quarterback with wins against all 32 NFL teams joining Brett Favre Drew Brees and Peyton Manning. With 68 yards passing Brady will surpass Brees’ mark of 80358 yards most ever in the regular season. It would add to his long list of NFL records that already includes most TD passes (591) most wins as a starting quarterback (232) most Super Bowl titles (seven) and most conference championships (10).

SHAQ ATTACK

For all the talk about what Brady’s arrival in Tampa Bay did for the offense the defense has been a big part of the team’s success too. In addition to leading the league in rushing defense each of the past two seasons the Bucs have had one of the league’s most effective pass rushes since Todd Bowles was hired as coordinator in 2019.

Linebacker Shaquil Barrett topped the NFL with 19 1/2 sacks two years ago and finished with eight during the regular season in 2020. He has one through three games this year none the past two weeks.

As a team the Bucs are last in the league with three sacks.

“I think Todd knows and Shaq knows it’s time to get to the quarterback” coach Bruce Arians said. “Just one sack is not good enough.”

FIRST IMPRESSIONS

Arians is noted for his success working with quarterbacks over a long career as a NFL assistant and head coach. Manning Ben Roethlisberger Andrew Luck Carson Palmer and Jameis Winston are among the high draft picks Arians mentored over the years.

The coach who turns 69 on Sunday likes what he’s seen so far from New England rookie Mac Jones.

“I loved him coming out. He’s smart a pocket player who’s going to get the ball out and he’s very accurate” Arians said. “Obviously pressure doesn’t bother him. He played in some big games (at Alabama). He led his team to the championship so yeah he’s legit.”

NO GRONK

Gronkowski spent nine seasons with the Patriots and ended his tenure with 521 receptions for 7861 yards and 79 touchdowns the most receiving TDs in franchise history.

But a person familiar with the situation said Saturday that Gronk did not travel with the Super Bowl champions for his anticipated return to New England. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because Gronkowski’s status had not been updated by the team.

Gronkowski 32 was listed as doubtful on Friday. It’s the first game he has missed since he came out of retirement to play alongside Brady with the Buccaneers.

Gronkowski had 45 receptions for 623 yards and seven touchdowns in his first season with Tampa Bay and then caught four more TD passes from Brady during the team’s 2-1 start this year.

Grieve has been with the Washington Senators/Texas Rangers franchise for over 50 years in a variety of roles including as a player from 1970 1972-1977 general manager and broadcaster. During his nine seasons as an MLB player Grieve was primarily an outfielder and designated hitter.

Since 1995 Grieve has served as a color analyst on Rangers television broadcasts. Over the past few years Grieve has reduced the number of games he's called each season. In 2021 Grieve was only scheduled to call 25 games on the new Bally's Sports Southwest.

John Blake Rangers EVP of Communications says that 2022 will be Grieve's 28th and final season as a Rangers broadcaster.

While Grieve can get surly occasionally I do enjoy hearing him on Rangers games. He provides more insight than C.J. Nitkowski and works well with play-by-play voice Dave Raymond. Hopefully in 2022 Grieve will be on at least 25-35 home game broadcasts on Bally's Sports Southwest.

Grieve's post-playing career with the Rangers also includes front office roles starting in 1980. He was promoted to director of player development after the 1982 season and then rose to the role of Vice President and General Manager in September 1984.

In 10 seasons as the Rangers general manager (1985-1994) Grieve's teams finished second in the American League West Division twice in 1986 and 1993. In 1994 the Rangers were in first place in the AL West when the Players' Strike and subsequent Owners' Lockout ended the regular season in mid- August and forced the cancellation of the postseason.

Grieve was elected to the Texas Rangers team Hall of Fame in 2010 and was a part of the Rangers front office that built The Ballpark in Arlington.

The 31-year-old won around 375.000 dollars after betting on whether a pitch invader would make in onto the field during the NFL match.

Andrade told the WPEC-TV channel that the 15 seconds on the Raymond James Stadium pitch was the biggest adrenaline rush of his life.

After getting past the security he caught the attention of the crowd in the stadium and the millions of people who watched the Super Bowl on TV.

Andrade was arrested spent one night in jail and the next day he was released on a 500 dollar bail. He is now accused of trespassing on a place with prohibited access to the public.

The idea reportedly came from the famous YouTuber Vitaly Zdorovetskiy who acknowledged that this is the fifth time that he has managed to get a person onto the field during a Super Bowl the largest sporting event in the United States.

According to US media Andrade's garment featured the name of a pornographic website. However Andrade noted that he did not receive money to wear it although they did pay for his Super Bowl ticket."

On Sunday his service and sacrifice was honored at the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial in Emmitsburg Maryland.

On April 17 2019 Hudson a 73-year-old firefighter with the Argyle Volunteer Fire Department was dispatched to a fire south of Custer. While en route Hudson suffered a medical emergency.

Firefighters on his vehicle noticed he had fallen unconscious and requested an ambulance. Attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead at a Custer hospital.

A firefighter fatality notice published by the United States Fire Administration in July 2020 said Hudson suffered a heart attack as a result of overexertion and stress.

Hudson was named to the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation’s (NFFF) 2020 Roll of Honor commemorating and honoring the sacrifices of firefighters from across the United States who paid the ultimate price.

This year’s NFFF memorial ceremony — which took place Sunday at the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial in Maryland — paid homage to 215 American firefighters who have passed since 2019.

“That number is much higher than usual because the global pandemic forced the cancellation of last year’s memorial weekend” said Dave Statter a communications consultant for the foundation.

This year’s Roll of Honor also included firefighters who lost their battle with COVID-19.

“Today is a day of both great pain and great pride” Jan Gardner executive of Frederick County (Maryland) said at Sunday’s gathering. “We take comfort in knowing that the men and women we are honoring sacrificed themselves in service to others. That truly is the greatest expression of love — and it is love that brings us together.”

The memorial constructed in 1981 is a 7-foot-tall stone monument featuring a sculpted Maltese cross the traditional symbol of the fire service. The base of the monument is the Eternal Flame symbolizing the spirit of all firefighters — past present and future.

The names of fallen firefighters are engraved on plaques and bricks which surround the memorial.

“The names of the memorial not only memorialize those men and women but also represent the history of the American fire service” acting U.S. Fire Administrator Tonya Hoover said. “Behind every name is a story of service and sacrifice.”

Troy Markel chairman of the NFFF said the foundation’s mission goes beyond memorializing the names of fallen firefighters but also to help families in their time of grief.

Each family of a fallen firefighter was presented with a personalized badge a red rose and an American flag that was flown over the U.S. Capitol and the memorial.

Before he became a volunteer firefighter in Argyle Hudson served as a Florida state trooper and even had a stint with the Department of Homeland Security as a firearms instructor.

The commemoration came as Fire Prevention Week kicked off across the nation Sunday.

South Dakota State Fire Marshal Paul Merriman wants the public to focus on the sounds of fire safety this year encouraging individuals to familiarize themselves with the chirps of their fire and carbon monoxide alarms.

Congress created the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation to lead a nationwide effort to honor America’s fallen firefighters. Since 1992 the nonprofit has developed and expanded programs that fulfill that mandate. Their mission is to honor and remember America’s fallen fire heroes provide resources to assist their families in rebuilding their lives and work within the fire service community to reduce firefighter deaths and injuries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vaGVscC51bmhjci5vcmcvc291dGhhZnJpY2EvMjAyMS8xMC8wMi9kaGEtYW5ub3VuY2VzLXJlb3BlbmluZy1vZi1zZXJ2aWNlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DHA announces additional services at RRO's - UNHCR South Africa,"The Government of South Africa has officially extended the validity of asylum seeker and refugee permits until 30 April 2021 date until which all permits that expired on or after the national state of disaster was declared in March 2020 are considered valid and should be renewed through the Online Renewal System. UNHCR strongly encouraged those that have not yet done so to renew their permits over email until the deadline.

The Department for Home Affairs (DHA) has announced further reopening of selected services at the Refugee Reception Offices by appoitment and the expansion of the online systems.

DHA’s Message:

INTRODUCTION OF ADDITIONAL SERVICES AT REFUGEE RECEPTION OFFICES

The Refugee Reception offices (RROs) were closed since the 26th of March 2020 due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and subsequent lock down regulations. In April 2021 the Department introduced the Online System for extension of section 22 and section 24 visas and further undertook to introduce other services in a staggered manner.

In line with this approach the Department committed to introduce other category of services including new asylum applications and family joining for children born outside the Republic of South Africa. These services will now become available with effect from 3 May 2022.

In view of the termination of the national state of disaster the department is finalizing plans to allow “walk-ins”. Once the plan is finalized the refugee community will be informed through various mechanisms such as Public Notices and Stakeholder Engagements on how services can be accessed.

The online services will continue to be provided through the Online System and requests for appointment can be directed to the relevant RRO through the following contacts:

The Department is taking this approach in order to ensure that services are provided humanely and in a coordinated and efficient manner.

NEW APPLICATIONS FOR ASYLUM

The Department will start processing new asylum applications from the 3 May 2022. People who want to make applications for asylum in South Africa are urged to contact the Department by means of the following email address: [email protected] to send a request for asylum application.

Upon the receipt of email a client will be scheduled for appointment and notified to come to an office on a specific date. On the email a client must provide the following details: Full Names Surname Date of Birth Nationality / Country of Birth Dependents (if any) Date of arrival in South Africa Port of Entry into South Africa Current Residential Address where the person lives Contact details including Email Cellphone Number and Telephone Number where a person can be reached indicate a Language of preference and the Center where they want to make an application.

NB: An applicant must be within the borders of South Africa to send a request for asylum application. An applicant must also attach all the supporting documents such as a Passport identity document certificate of birth etc. This information will assist the Centre to start preparing the application record in advance.

It was a number that would quite literally make your head spin because it represented the percentage of tetrahydrocannabinol — or THC the main psychoactive chemical in marijuana — that one lab reported was contained in the cannabis flower from a Utah producer.

Even the strongest marijuana strains rarely break into the low 30% range and some believe the physical limit of the plant to be in the mid-30s. Indeed Sugar House Selects’ Ice Cream Cake Bud coming in at 45.13% to be precise might well have set a world record for the most potent weed on Earth.

The cultivator promoted the jaw-dropping report on its Instagram page as did one local dispensary.

But the numbers didn’t pass the smell test for Christine Stenquist a long-time patient advocate.

This Instagram post by Sugar House Selects touted a strain of cannabis that contained 45% THC a level well beyond the most potent plants. The product was later re-tested and found to have half that concentration.

“I knew the lab results were wrong” she said. “They were wrong and it goes against everything we’re trying to educate the public and community about. We’re not chasing highs we’re trying to get good medicine.”

So she contacted the grower and the lab Aromatic Plant Research Center — or APRC — who after some wrangling agreed to test a new sample. The result: 21.71% THC less than half the original result.

The discrepancy poses some serious questions for Utah’s fledgling medical marijuana program. After all we wouldn’t accept it if the labels on our prescription medications were off by that factor.

On an initial test the Ice Cream Cake Bud strain of cannabis showed an amazing 45% THC concentration. When it was re-tested it showed a concentration of 21% reflected in the report above.

So who ensures consumers are getting what the label says and not something much weaker or potentially much stronger?

Originally all of Utah’s medical cannabis plants and products were going to be tested at the state lab run by the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food — which also tests dairy products meat and crops — but it soon became apparent it couldn’t keep up. Backlogs were as long as five weeks so the state licensed APRC to increase testing capacity.

The APRC lab sits in a standard-issue business complex in Lehi where it got its start doing work for essential oils makers in the area running tests similar to those it now does on cannabis products.

State agents deliver unmarked samples chosen randomly from a crop of plants or processed products — like edibles and vape oils — to be tested. The samples are pulverized treated with a solvent and run through a series of tests to measure the cannabinoid profile detect residual solvents or microbes and detect moisture levels that might lead to mold.

(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Will Deutschman lab director at Aromatic Plant Research Center in Lehi on Thursday Sept. 30 2021.

The lab can also produce a flavor and aroma analysis. Products can also be sent out for tests to detect residual pesticides and metals.

Turnaround is usually a few days. Typically the team runs tests on 15 samples a day although with crops now being harvested they recently plowed through 44 in a single day.

As part of the state licensing process the state sends samples it has already tested to see if they get the same results said Will Deutschman who spent 20 years as a professor of biochemistry at Westminster College and took over running APRC’s lab in early June.

Deutschman said he can’t comment on the Ice Cream Cake results that Stenquist flagged because of client confidentiality and because he hadn’t yet joined the lab when the sample came through.

But since coming aboard he said he has been focused on putting protocols in place to identify results that are outliers and retest the samples.

“We certainly are trying to make sure that really strange things do not go out the door ever again” he said.

Cody James manager of the Industrial Hemp and Medical Cannabis program at the Department of Agriculture and Food said Utah has learned from how other states run their programs and believes there are adequate safeguards on the testing process.

The state monitors lab reports and can have tests rerun if something seems amiss. If consumers raise concerns the state can have tests run again to make sure it matches what’s on the label. Most importantly James said both the state and ARPC labs are in fact catching things like foreign matter pesticides mold and residual solvents in products.

“Because we’re seeing that” he said “I feel confident we are looking at everything we need to and they’re catching the things that need to be caught.”

Justin Arriola a cannabis industry consultant in Utah said he has been frustrated by some of the results he’s seen from the labs.

“We’ve worked with both of the testing facilities in Utah and we’ve had problems with the accuracy from both of the labs” he said. In some instances he said the results were off by as much as 30%.

Arriola said he’s had to pay for independent testing or to have products retested because it’s obvious some lab results were way off. Those extra tests can cost hundreds of dollars.

But it’s important he said especially when working with highly concentrated products where a discrepancy in testing can make a big difference in the dose a patient gets.

“We’re working with potent products and we want people to understand the amount of medicine they’re getting” Arriola told me.

Utah would not be the first state to encounter issues with cannabis labs.

In early 2019 a California lab was shut down for doctoring its data. Last October an Oklahoma lab surrendered its license after being accused of falsifying data. And in December a lab in Washington State was shut down after a whistleblower revealed it had been inflating the reported THC concentrations — since studies have shown plants with higher concentrations sell at a higher price.

I want to be clear that I am not suggesting that’s what is happening here. Deutschman struck me as sincere about ensuring the integrity and transparency of his lab. And frankly if someone was making up numbers they would’ve been better off to come up with something believable that wouldn’t raise red flags.

What seems to have happened is that someone made a mistake. And that mistake ended up on shelves promoted by dispensaries and consumed by patients. What we don’t know is how many other less obvious mistakes might have slipped through the cracks as well.

So how do we keep it from happening again?

Deutschman said part of it is building good communication a willingness of cultivators and processors to talk to the labs when they see something that doesn’t make sense.

But a tight-knit community of growers and labs won’t solve all the problems in Utah’s budding marijuana industry.

State regulators need to do a better job monitoring the lab reports. They should have caught this anomaly the mythical 45% and had the sample retested before it landed on dispensary shelves.

Also regular auditing of records could signal problems. In Nevada records monitoring detected THC creep — where THC concentrations in products steadily climbed — pointing regulators to a problematic lab. In 2018 California regulators noticed one lab was detecting pesticides at a much lower rate than others. The lab ultimately forfeited its license.

What the program really needs is more independent labs — something James said the state would love to have but none have stepped forward. More labs mean more capacity and the ability to rest random samples in different labs to see if they get the same results. If they don’t you might have a problem.

And that will come with a cost adding to Utah’s already expensive medical cannabis program.

But offering cheap products to patients doesn’t mean much if they can’t be assured that the medicine they’re actually getting is what’s on the label and if the doses they’re taking are going to be effective and most importantly safe.

Madison-Ridgeland Academy is making a habit of scoring a lot of points on Jackson Prep these days.

Defending MAIS Class 6A state champion MRA scored 50 points for the second time in two seasons on Prep in a 50-20 victory Friday night at Prep.

MRA senior wide receiver and Southern Miss commitment Davis Dalton set a Mississippi record with 388 receiving yards on 14 catches and scored three touchdowns and sophomore quarterback John White completed 28 of 40 passes for 521 yards and four TDs.

MRA improved to 5-3 and won its fourth straight game. Prep dropped to 4-3 and had a four-game winning streak snapped.

MRA which defeated Prep for the fourth consecutive time scored 50 points in a 50-24 victory last year. It is the most points ever allowed by a Prep team in school history.

. White completed TD passes of 41 67 and 64 yards to Dalton and 13 yards to senior wide receiver Street Toler in the first half as MRA jumped out to a 27-3 lead. Dalton – a member of the Priority One Bank/Mississippi Scoreboard Metro Jackson Preseason Elite Eleven – caught eight passes for 260 yards in the first half. Davis has now caught 26 passes for 679 yards and nine TDs in the past three games and has caught 56 passes for 1098 yards and 10 TDs this season.

“Davis really ran some great routes and made some incredible catches” MRA coach Herbert Davis said.

Said first-year Prep coach Tyler Turner: “Dalton is a great football player and we had trouble covering him tonight.”

MRA’s scoring habits on Prep goes back to the championship game in 2019 when Philip Short set a MAIS passing record with 593 yards in a 49-33 victory to end Prep’s seven-year state championship run.

White who transferred to MRA from Winona Christian came into the game ranked No. 8 in the nation with 1988 yards according to MaxPreps. White who has been offered by Liberty and Southern Miss will likely move up after Friday night’s performance.

“John really threw the ball where he was supposed to. It was the best he has all year” Davis said. “Our offensive line protected well and gave John time. We really executed in the passing game.”

Prep’s only points in the first half was from a 42-yard field by senior kicker Louie Gatlin. Prep junior quarterback Paxton Thompson completed TD passes to senior wide receiver Luke Williams and junior wide receiver Will Upton in the second half. Thompson completed 18 of 32 passes for 306 yards and two TDs. Upton caught five passes for 125 yards.

Turner replaced Mississippi Sports Hall of Famer and former National Football Coach of the Year Ricky Black who resigned this spring after winning 401 games – second winningest in Mississippi history – in his 40-year career and 263 games and 13 state titles at Prep in 24 seasons. Black was celebrated Friday night and many of his former players came to the event.

“Hats off to Madison-Ridgeland Academy on a well-played football game” Turner said. “Our guys played hard like they always do and I’m proud of them for that. We just missed some opportunities that could have given us a lot of momentum in the game. We had three dropped picks on drives they score on stopped them on third down back up and we rough the punter and we didn’t do a very good job on third down offensively and defensively. We just have to keep working and getting better as a team and get some players back healthy and take what we learned tonight and get better from it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL21pc3Npc3NpcHBpc2NvcmVib2FyZC5jb20vbmF0aW9uYWxseS1yYW5rZWQtZ3JlZW52aWxsZS1jaHJpc3RpYW4tZGVmZWF0cy1qYS0zMC05LXdpbnMtMTh0aC1zdHJhaWdodC13aW4tYWdhaW5zdC1taXNzaXNzaXBwaS10ZWFtcy1ieS1yb2JlcnQtd2lsc29uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NATIONALLY RANKED GREENVILLE CHRISTIAN DEFEATS JA 30-9 WINS 18TH STRAIGHT WIN AGAINST ...,"Photo gallery below

Greenville Christian ranked No. 58 in the nation by MaxPreps continued to stake its claim as the best team in Mississippi as the Saints became only in the second team in 21 years to defeat MAIS traditional Class 6A powers Madison-Ridgeland Academy Jackson Prep and now Jackson Academy in the same season.

Greenville Christian which defeated MHSAA Class 6A defending state champion Oak Grove two weeks jumped out to a 27-point halftime lead and defeated JA 30-9 Friday night at JA.

Defending MAIS Class 3A state champion Greenville Christian improved to 7-1 and won its 18th consecutive game against Mississippi competition. The Saints’ only loss is to 2020 Georgia public school Class 7A runner-up Collins Hill ranked No. 7 in the nation in the Freedom Bowl in Atlanta. Greenville Christian defeated two defending champions Oak Grove 48-41 and two-time defending MAIS Class 6A state champion MRA 58-32 in the season opener both on the road. The only other team to defeat MRA Prep and JA in the same season since 1999 is Presbyterian Christian in 2016.

2020 MAIS Class 6A runner-up JA playing without star running back Marcus Harris (ankle injury) dropped to 4-2.

Greenville Christian senior quarterback D.J. Smith completed 22 of 32 passes for 232 yards and three touchdowns most of those yards and all three TDs in the first half. Smith also ran for 66 yards on 14 carries. Smith completed a 27-yard TD pass to senior wide receiver and Southern Miss commit Chris Bell on the first drive of the game. Bell went up and made a great catch between two JA defenders in the end zone for the TD. Smith added the 2-point conversion for an 8-0 lead with 10:16 in the first quarter. Smith connected with senior running back Marlon Palmer for an 11-yard TD for a 14-0 lead with 11:42 to go in the second quarter. JA senior kicker Scott Swalley kicked a 29-yard field goal before Palmer scored on a 5-yard run for a 20-3 lead. Greenville Christian added a safety and Smith hit Bell for a 20-yard TD with 9 seconds to go before half for a 30-3 lead. Bell caught seven passes for 90 yards and two TDs and Palmer ran 14 times for 77 yards and one TD and caught four passes for 34 yards and one TD.

“I thought we really played well in the first half” Greenville Christian coach Jon Reed McLendon said. “D.J. made some big time plays in the face of some pressure. It was impressive how he was able to stay up and get the ball out and make something happen out of nothing. Chris and Marlon were good again. I thought defensively we were tough. We gave up some things here and there but got stops when we needed to.”

JA senior quarterback Tate Collins completed a 39-yard TD to senior wide receiver Dakota Jordan with 3:21 to go in the game for JA’s only TD. Jordan made a juggling grab around the 10-yard line and ran into the end zone for the score. Collins completed 10 of 16 passes for 135 yards and one TD. Jordan a Mississippi State football and baseball commit caught five passes for 88 yards and one TD.

Greenville Christian senior linebacker J.D. Stewart a Southern Miss commit had a team-high seven tackles and senior Daishun Scott had six. JA senior defensive back Kris Robinson had a team-high nine tackles and senior defensive back Porter Harrell and senior defensive back Trey Adams had six each.

Second-year JA head coach Lance Pogue knows all about nationally ranked teams. He coached several at South Panola. In fact in 2010 Pogue’s South Panola team finished No. 1 in the nation in the USA Today Super 25 poll. The Tigers went 15-0 won the Class 5A state title and defeated national powers Memphis University School and Colquitt County Ga. along the way. In Pogue’s second season at South Panola in 2008 Meridian ended South Panola’s nation-best 89-game winning streak with a 26-20 overtime victory for the 5A state title ending South Panola’s five-year string of state championships.

“I don’t know if I’ve ever been prouder of a group of kids” Pogue said. “Our kids fought. We’ve got guts. We’ve got heart. Greenville Christian is a great football team. They’ve wiped out the state of Mississippi and we played them tough. They are the 50th best team in the country. We could have come out in the second half and melted but we didn’t. We’ve got something to build on. We didn’t have this kind of heart and guts a few years ago. We are turning the tide. We are trying to g­­­­et this program to get to the level to win a championship.”",,,
ROK,Rockwell Automation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJvYm90cmVwb3J0LmNvbS9wYWNrZXhwby0yMDIxLXJlY2FwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PackExpo 2021 Recap,"Listen to this article

PackExpo 2021 returned as a live event this year in Las Vegas and judging from the participation by exhibitors and attendance by the industry the event was a huge success. Official numbers from the PackExpo website listed the number of exhibitors at 1500+ and the number of registrants at 23000+.

According to the Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies packaging machinery shipments could reach $12.8 billion in 2026 growing at a CAGR of 5.2 percent. The growth is accelerated in part by e-commerce.

I attended the first two days of this year’s event and I was impressed by the actual number of folks who showed up for the show. But this event is so huge and covers so much square footage that it felt like I had run a marathon at the end of those two days.

Palletizing and packoff are key applications

The automation stars of this show were robotic palletizers and conveyor picking/packoff robots. Delta style robots have evolved to be the mechanism of choice for conveyor picking applications and there were a number of delta robots on display.

For palletizing there are many solutions to choose from. This includes both industrial and collaborative robotic manipulators.

Industrial robots vs collaborative robots safety

When industrial robots are deployed into palletizing applications there are now a number of safety certified “safety zone” management solutions on the market. This enables the higher speeds and payloads of industrial robots while allowing the actual robots to remain unguarded. Compare this to the constraints in speed and payload of a collaborative palletizing solution.

The safety zone management solutions detect a human entering the space around the robot and slow or stop the robot motion so that the robot doesn’t injure the human.

The one vendor (at the show) with a universal safety solution is Veo Robotics. I had the opportunity to talk to CEO and co-founder Patrick Sobalvarro at the show about the solution. The solution is fully safety certified and includes a completely redundant safety processor that double checks on the state of the system process in real-time. There’s no other solution currently on the market with Veo’s level of safety design. The downside to Veo is that the Veo safety controller is larger than any robot controller currently on the market.

And the award goes to…

Over a dozen new robotic automation products debuted at the show. My pick for the most innovative product debut goes to the Robotiq Palletizing Solution. This solution wraps a complete palletizing solution around a UR10 robot. It mounts the UR 10 on a vertical linear axis that is integrated kinematically within the UR software. It is a $90K (USD) solution that provides palletizing for high-mix low-volume applications and is a great solution for small manufacturers.

Pack to the future

PMMI debuted a new historical packaging machinery exhibit for the first time at PackExpo 2021. This exhibit included several dozen permanent displays highlighting the evolution and innovation in packaging automation over the last two centuries.

Each year PMMI will bring the “Pack to the future” exhibit to the PackExpo event and will continue to grow the exhibit as it acquires new “old” equipment worthy of display.

Vendor updates

Let’s take a look at all of the various new products that were announced or launched at the show.

ABB Robotics

ABB had a variety of demos of their articulated robots performing pick and place and palletizing operations. However the star of the show for ABB was the new ABB IRB 390 Flexpacker Delta robot. The IRB 390 Flexpacker is an IP69 full washdown robot. The robot was on display in the Fallas Automation booth (an ABB integrator). The IRB 390 comes in two configurations: a 4 axis / 15 kg payload; a 5 axis / 10 kg payload.

CMES Robotics

Korea-based CMES Robotics demonstrated random item depalletization using 3D vision to identify box locations on the pallet. The solution can work with any articulated robot to depalletize items onto a conveyor. The company also demonstrated a “void filling” vision application that takes a picture of a filled order box and then determines how much filler product to dispense to accurately “fill the box void” without waste. This was the first time that the company has demonstrated its solution in North America.

Festo

Festo makes a complete line of gripper and gripping accessories. While grippers may be mundane Festo still finds new ways to innovate and improve gripping technology. This year Festo showed two new technologies:

New compliant gripper The compliant gripper technology uses a finger pad filled with beads to offer passive compliance as the gripper closes on an item. Then by pulling a vacuum on the finger pad the beads are locked into their pattern and can hold a tight custom fit. New multi item vacuum gripper Also on display was a new “multi-item” vacuum gripper designed for robotic e-commerce bin picking applications. The vacuum cup is designed to pick up all of the various packaging materials for e-commerce fulfillment. This includes thin plastic bags corrugated cardboard and bubble packs.

Kawasaki Robotics

Kawasaki Robotics showed both a palletizing demo and a delta robot packaging demo in their booth. For all of the major robotics manufacturers in attendance there was an unwritten rule that you needed to show off either palletizing and/or pack off with your robots. Kawasaki also displayed their new “fast compact” robots for the first time.

Here are some of the specs of the new robots:

RS007N/L 6-axis 7 kg payload Horizontal reach: 730 mm / 930 mm Vertical reach: 1356 mm / 1726 mm

RS013N 6-axis 13 kg payload Horizontal reach: 1460 mm Vertical reach: 1965 mm



Kuka Robotics

Kuka Robotics launched the new small form factor KRC5 micro controller at the show. This new robot controller will be the controls for all of the smaller robots coming from Kuka in the future. Kuka also launched their new KR3 delta robot a stainless steel IP69 4 axis packaging solution.

Kuka also introduced their newest tabletop SCARA robot the KR6. The new KR6 provides a 6-kg payload and positions at a repeatability of +/- .02 mm. It offers reach/radius options of 500 and 700 mm and Z-axis stroke of 200 mm.

Of course because this was a packaging show Kuka also demonstrated the CUBE Palletizing Cell from FOCUS Integration. CUBE features a KUKA KRC4 controller technology and flexible KR IONTEC robot.

Lastly Kuka had a stationary KMP1500 mobile robot on display in the booth. This 1500 kg payload capacity “tunneling” AMR uses omni move (mecanum) wheels and is designed for lineside replenishment and FGI movement.

Mujin Robotics

Another company making its US debut is Japanese robot company Mujin Robotics. You can read our recent news story about the Mujin product launch.

At PackExpo Mujin had one of the largest booths of any of the robotics companies in attendance and they demonstrated their model-driven palletizing/depalletizing solution. Mujin was also one of the few companies to have a moving mobile robot within their booth. The mobile robot was picking up and moving pallets from the palletizing robot workcell. I got a tour of the booth and an introduction to Mujin solutions from CEO Ross Diankov.

OSARO

OSARO demonstrated its first robotics solution for automated bagging. The system can use any articulated 6-axis robot to pick an item from a bin and place it into a bagger. This solves the multi-SKU poly bagging process for e-commerce operations and OSARO is looking to deploy the solution soon at several fulfillment providers.

OSARO’s drop-in replacement for manual bagging stations can package individual items at a rate of 350 pieces per hour with less overhead and superior ROI.

OSARO’s solution reads the product’s barcode and generates an appropriate shipping label. The system is designed for general e-commerce order fulfillment or specialized distribution like cosmetics pharmacy or manufactured parts.

Omron

Omron had a number of demos in its booth including a mini-factory. The mini-factory included a next-generation mobile manipulator (MoMa) collaborative robot mounted to the LD-250 mobile robot a pick and place robot a SCARA robot an AI-powered vision inspection system a palletizer cobot and other artificial intelligence and machine learning functionality.

In the mini-factory the hybrid robot was configured with an Omron TM14M robot manipulator arm mounted on an LD-250 autonomous mobile robot.

The Omron i4L SCARA robot arm in conjunction with Omron’s ACE programming software that contains built-in vision handled both primary and secondary packaging.

The Omron i4L SCARA robot arm is capable of lifting 5-kilogram loads including a wide range of parts packages or pouches of nearly any shape even in unstructured environments. A high degree of repeatability and fast cycle times expedite parts handling while allowing operators to focus on more critical tasks.

On display publicly for the first time was the new Omron i4L series tabletop SCARA robots. These robots feature the robot controller in the base of the robot and are programmed with Omron’s “Automation Control Environment” software package (ACE). The i4L robots are available in 350mm 450mm and 550mm reach versions.

Omron also had a Delta robot demo but it wasn’t the latest Omron Sysmac delta robot.

Robotiq

As mentioned already in the introduction Robotiq demonstrated its new Palletizing Solution featuring a UR10 collaborative robot. The solution includes everything to set up a palletizing station that picks from one or two infeed locations and can fill two complete pallets. The solution is easy to program as you only need to teach the pick locations and one corner of each pallet. The system is programmed entirely from the UR pendant.

Rockwell Automation

Rockwell has entered into a new relationship with Comau robots. All of the Comau robots can now be programmed within the Rockwell Automation Studio 5000 software. Rockwell has an existing relationship with Denso robots as well.

Users can completely build out a digital twin of the workcell or production line in Emulate3D. All of the components can be imported in as CAD files to ease the layout task. Within Emulate3D an entire line can be animated to view the assembly process.

Universal Robots

Universal Robots is very adept at sizing their booth and product demonstrations to the needs and expectations for the show. At PackExpo 2021 UR featured solution demonstrations from two of their UR+ partners. In the booth was the aforementioned Robotiq Palletizer demo (the sister demo was featured in the Robotiq booth).

UR also had a live demo of the new collaborative box erector box EZ from Flex-Line Automation Inc. By using a collaborative robot Flex-Line has reduced the footprint of traditional box erectors while allowing staff to work safely alongside the unit without excessive guarding. It can erect a variety of box sizes with one redeployable unit.

Vecna Robotics



Vecna Robotics was at the PackExpo for the first time. Vecna was the only “pure play” mobile robotics company at this show. The only other mobile robot products on the floor were the OMRON LD250 and the Kuka KMP1500. While Vecna didn’t have a moving robot they did bring an autonomous pallet loader for their booth. Vecna’s new CEO Craig Malloy was in attendance for his first trade show since taking the helm in July 2021.

Veo Robotics

Veo Robotics has one of the most unique safety solutions on the market. They have been an early innovator in what is described as “3D safeguarding”. This enables human-robot collaboration without guarding and it has taken the company five plus years to perfect the solution and receive the safety certifications necessary to support their vision.

With the Veo FreeMove solution a number of FreeMove sensors are deployed over the work envelope of an industrial robot. Using time-of-flight lasers and cameras the system is able to actively detect humans encroaching in a robot’s work area. The solution uses a completely redundant safety processor that double checks on the state of the system processes continually.

The result is a safety supervisor that watches the workspace around the robot and can slow or stop the robot motion when it detects a human entering the workspace.

The system can learn about the things that belong in the workspace like the moving robot arm boxes conveyors and even autonomous mobile robots. BUT if a human enters the robot workspace even if they crawl along the floor OR enter the workspace and try to hide under a table the system will detect them. Anything entering the work area will trip a safety violation.

VEO meets all relevant safety certifications and helps clients to complete the risk assessment during the deployment of the solution.

Wyzo Robotics

Wyzo Robotics is a Swiss company and it launched both the company and their unique collaborative delta robot into the US at PackExpo.

The new collaborative Wyzo Sidebot delta robot is the first of its kind. You read that correctly it’s a collaborative delta-style robot able to be moved around your facility where it’s needed and operate safely around other human workers without the need for guarding.

The Sidebot is made from carbon fiber and it is also the first robot (anywhere) to employ the novel Genesis direct drive motor.

The company is currently building out its North American sales channel and is recruiting new distributors and integrators in the US.

Yaskawa Robotics

Yaskawa had a number of solution demos in their booth including their impressive safety zoned palletizing demo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzLzgtMTYtY2Fnci0tdG8tYmUtcmVjb3JkZWQtaW4taG1pLW1hcmtldC1iZXR3ZWVuLTIwMjEtYW5kLTIwMjUtMTctMDAwLXRlY2huYXZpby1yZXNlYXJjaC1yZXBvcnRzLTMwMTM4OTY5NS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,8.16% CAGR to be Recorded in HMI Market between 2021 and 2025| 17000+ Technavio Research Reports,"Technavio offers in-depth market insights that assist global businesses to obtain growth opportunities.

WWE Hall of Famer Edge referenced AEW stars Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler aka FTR during a backstage segment on this week's SmackDown.

After Seth Rollins invaded the Copeland residence a frantic Edge could be seen calling his wife Beth Phoenix and asking her to go to her sister's place instead of returning home from grocery shopping. Edge said he had sought help from ""Daniel and David"" who were en route to their home to deal with Rollins. This was a reference to FTR; David is the real first name of Harwood and Daniel is Wheeler.

FTR and Edge are friends in real life and reside in the same neighborhood in Asheville NC.

Last year Edge revealed that FTR helped him get back to shape ahead of his in-ring return.

""The Revival they both live in Asheville so they'd come and they'd get in there with me and they'd put me through my paces"" Edge said [H/T Cultaholic]. ""I didn't want to come back and be anything less than what I was. I'm going to have to work differently. I'm going to have different limitations... I still want to be able to go in there and be able to go half an hour.""

Both Wheeler and Harwood took to Twitter to confirm that Edge was referring to them.

Harwood tweeted:

I'll go over there right now & beat his little bitchass.

On Tuesday Aug. 15 2017 the Commerce Department releases retail sales data for July. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)

TAMPA Fla. (WFLA) — Decorating and design enthusiasts can now get all the off-price goodness of a HomeGoods run without leaving their house.

With so many other companies focused on making it easier and faster to buy things online HomeGoods and other TJX stores Ross and Burlington have been known for doing the opposite – ditching e-commerce for a “treasure hunt”-style experience.

Now the retailer hopes that an online presence will only grow the company further with the launch of HomeGoods.com.

“We are excited to expand HomeGoods’ digital footprint so customers can shop whenever they’d like” said TJX Digital US President Mark DeOliveira in a press release. “HomeGoods.com will provide a complementary experience to our stores allowing shoppers to pair in-store purchases with online finds to bring their vision to life” DeOliveira said.

What remains to be seen however is if customers in 2021 will generously embrace the shipping policy which is a good bit pricier than people are used to with Amazon Prime.

HomeGoods.com is offering free shipping but only if you spend $119 or more. Failing to hit that threshold will result in a $14.99 shipping charge.

HomeGoods says shoppers can return eligible items for free at any one of the more than 820 HomeGoods locations across the U.S. or return by mail for a $14.99 fee.

The store said it plans to continue to expand its online merchandise after the initial launch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vbG9zc3ByZXZlbnRpb25tZWRpYS5jb20vbHAtcGVvcGxlLW9uLXRoZS1tb3ZlLXNlcHRlbWJlci0yMDIxL9IBS2h0dHBzOi8vbG9zc3ByZXZlbnRpb25tZWRpYS5jb20vbHAtcGVvcGxlLW9uLXRoZS1tb3ZlLXNlcHRlbWJlci0yMDIxLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LP People on the Move: September 2021,"September is back-to-school time for students and an opportunity for new growth for those heading off to experience the exciting adventures of college life for the first time.

A Memorandum of Understanding between the two organizations was signed by VIPA Executive Director Carlton Dowe and Royal Caribbean Group’s Vice President of Destination Development Joshua Carroll during a cruise event in Miami. The memorandum is a recommitment from Royal Caribbean Group to extend its existing 10-year pier-use agreement for preferential berthing at VIPA’s cruise facilities in Crown Bay St. Thomas and Frederiksted St. Croix.

The existing agreement was executed in June 2016 and by signing the memorandum VIPA and Royal Caribbean Group agree to collaborate on an extension of that agreement for an additional number of years.

Dowe also announced that in addition to guaranteed minimum revenues to VIPA and increased cruise visits to both St. Thomas and St. Croix Royal Caribbean Group has expressed an interest in developing enhancements to the cruise facility in Crown Bay and making “landside improvements” in the Crown Bay District and St. Croix to enhance the island’s tourism products.

Dowe stated that this development signals “an important boost for the territory’s economy and increased opportunities for businesses and entrepreneurs in the tourism sector in the USVI.”

“Royal Caribbean is the leading cruise company in the industry and it has committed to a major infusion of capital as well as guaranteed cruise visits to our islands. In this currently strained economic climate this substantial commitment indicates Royal Caribbean Group’s dedication to the people of this territory and our economy” he said.

Dowe added that VIPA is “pleased” to continue its working relationship with Royal Caribbean Group.

“This MOU extends what has been an exceedingly amicable reliable and beneficial arrangement for both parties. Our unified goal is to ensure that the U.S. Virgin Islands is a premier destination in the Caribbean” he noted.

VIPA will align with Royal Caribbean Group to expand the Austin “Babe” Monsanto Marine Facility in Crown Bay to allow the berthing that includes Icon- and Quantum-class ships and the development of a third berth. The vision for the Crown Bay District will complement the port authority’s plans to revitalize the district to appeal to residents and cruise visitors.

Royal Caribbean Group has also committed to partner with VIPA and the Government of the USVI to develop and enhance the overall visitor experience in St. Croix.

“The U.S. Virgin Islands is one of our best destination partners and the opportunity to continue innovating on ways to refine the guest experience helps guide our decision to expand our already strong relationship with the U.S. Virgin Islands” said Carroll. “We thank Governor Albert Bryan Jr. the VIPA Board of Governors Commissioner of Tourism Joseph Boschulte and Executive Director Carlton Dowe and his team for collaborating on this exciting opportunity to develop destination experiences that benefit tourists and citizens of the USVI.”

The U.S. Virgin Islands recently started receiving cruise visits to its islands following the halt of cruising in March 2020. Most of the territory’s cruise visits have been Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises vessels.

The Celebrity Edge was the first ship to call on St. Thomas on July 20 and in St. Croix the Celebrity Equinox was the first ship to berth since the pandemic on Aug. 8.

According to a press release VIPA has had 22991 cruise visitors to the territory since July 2021 making it one of the most visited cruise destinations in the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vQ3J1aXNlLVRyYXZlbC9TdGF0ZS1vZi10aGUtY3J1aXNlLWluZHVzdHJ5LUJhdHRlcmVkLWJ1dC1ib3VuY2luZy1iYWNr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,State of the cruise industry: Battered bouncing back,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 405 Client Error: Not Allowed for url: https://www.travelweekly.com/Cruise-Travel/State-of-the-cruise-industry-Battered-but-bouncing-back on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHdlZWtseS5jb20vQ3J1aXNlLVRyYXZlbC9TdGF0ZS1vZi10aGUtY3J1aXNlLWluZHVzdHJ5LUJhdHRlcmVkLWJ1dC1ib3VuY2luZy1iYWNr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL2NydWlzZS1uZXdzLXVwZGF0ZS1vY3RvYmVyLTItMjAyMS81NzI1MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruise News Update: October 2 2021,"We’ve got you covered with another cruise news update covering the major cruise lines. It’s been a busy one as more ships resume operations in the U.S. and a huge demand for a Carnival cruise to Greenland.

Here we go with another cruise news update and of course it’s just another busy week in the cruise industry. We’ve got updates on Disney Cruise Line resuming sailings from San Diego Winter protocols from MSC Cruises second Carnival cruise ship begins sailings from Long Beach limited testing at terminals from Royal Caribbean Carnival’s Halloween plan Norwegian Cruise Line resuming from New York City and those high up at Carnival listened as another Greenland cruise is added.

Disney Wonder Restarts from San Diego

Guests are once again enjoying the magic that happens onboard Disney Cruise Line’s Disney Wonder. The vessel is sailing on a 4-day round-trip Halloween On The High Seas cruise from San Diego calling in Cabo San Lucas along with two days at sea.

The vessel departed on Friday October 1 to restart operations. Disney Wonder became the final ship in the fleet to resume and the first in the fleet on the West Coast.

The ship will be sailing on this itinerary for the near future alternating between three and four-day cruises to Baja Mexico. Three-night voyages will stop at the popular port of Ensenada and have a day at sea. The four-night cruises feature two days at sea and a call at Cabo San Lucas.

For the Baja Mexico cruise onboard Wonder all guests age 12 and above must be fully vaccinated and take a test upon embarkation. On November 5 1754-passenger Disney Wonder will sail on a 14-night cruise through the Panama Canal; for this cruise all guests regardless of age must be fully vaccinated to be allowed onboard.

Carnival Miracle Sails from Long Beach

Carnival Miracle has become the second in the fleet to resume sailings out of Long Beach California and it comes after the ship has already been sailing from Seattle Washington to Alaska since the end of July 2021.

On September 27 guests were welcomed on board with a party atmosphere and dancing from the crew in the atrium. The event was hosted by popular cruise director Jen Baxter and attended by the ship’s captain.

Carnival Miracle kicked off its offerings from Long Beach with a four-day Mexican Riviera itinerary. The ship made calls at Avalon at Catalina Island and Ensenada in Mexico. The vessel then returned to its homeport on Friday October 1 2021. The Spirit-class vessel will offer three- and four-day cruises for the remainder of the year.

Carnival Miracle joins Carnival Panorama which became the first to resume from the Port of Long Beach on August 21 2021. The Vista-class vessel is offering week-long cruises to the Mexican Riviera.

MSC Cruises Protocols for Winter

MSC Cruises aims to keep its health and safety measures through the winter season to make sure everyone remains safe onboard. The protocols were first introduced in August 2020 as MSC Cruises was among the earliest cruise lines to resume operations during the pandemic.

So for Caribbean cruises out of Miami and Port Canaveral all guests 12 years and above need to be fully vaccinated. For U.S. residents they will need to provide proof of a negative antigen or PCR test taken within 48 hours of before the cruise departure whilst non-U.S. residents will need a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of their cruise departure.

All guests aged from two years to 11 years will need to provide proof of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of their cruise departure.

We’ve got all the protocols for the different regions MSC Cruises operates in over on the website including the Southern Caribbean Mediterranean Nothern Europe and the Middle East. The Winter season protocols for South America and South Africa are to be released soon.

Carnival Adds Second Greenland Voyage

With such a huge demand for Carnival’s Greenland voyage departing in September 2023 the cruise line has been able to add an additional sailing. The voyage that departs on September 2 from the Port of Baltimore sold out in just 24 hours.

Carnival Cruise Line has now decided to add a second Greenland voyage which departs even earlier on August 13 2023. Carnival Legend will depart on Sunday August 13 starting with five consecutive days at sea and arriving at Nanortalik in Greenland on August 19. The next day on August 20 the Carnival ship will visit Qaqortoq followed by another day at sea.

On August 22 the ship will make a call at St. Anthony in Newfoundland. There will also be a call at Corner Brook in Newfoundland on August 23 and Sydney in Nova Scotia on August 24 2023. There will be two final days at sea before Carnival Legend arrives back in Baltimore Maryland on August 27.

Carnival Legend is becoming the go-to ship in the fleet for cruises to Greenland. The Spirit-class vessel first made visits to the country in 2013 out of Dover in the UK. The ship is currently preparing to begin sailings and replace sister ship Carnival Pride out of Baltimore on November 14 2021.

Royal Caribbean Terminal Testing

Guests scrambling to make sure they can get tested within the correct timeframe before a cruise will be happy to know that Royal Caribbean has come up with a backup with the “Boarding Day Test” option. The cruise line now offers pre-cruise testing at the terminal but it’s limited and should only really be used if all else fails.

In the email that’s been sent the cruise line starts by saying “Pros: A last option if you simply can’t find a pre-cruise test or could not secure results in time.” it means that guests should only use the terminal testing option if all other testing arrangements don’t work out such as home test kits and at a specific test site.

Royal Caribbean goes on to say in the email “Cons: For vaccinated guests only. Limited availability by appointment only. Wait up to an hour for results outside of terminal. Positive result unknown until boarding day.”

It’s good to know that the cruise line does have an option there if needed and it’s advised by the cruise line to “search out other options first.” Guests can then book an appointment 24 hours in advance for 30-minutes before check-in time. The testing at the terminal will cost at least $99 per person along with waiting outside the terminal for up to an hour for the result.

Carnival Halloween Sailings

For October Carnival cruise ships will offer Halloween onboard with a range of “Frightfully Fun” expanded offerings. Guests can enjoy costume contests trick or treating and already popular activities that will become Halloween versions. Here is the list of activities that will take place:

Patch’s Halloween Deck Party

Costume Contest

Dive-In Movie Specials at Carnival Seaside Theater

Patch’s Halloween Pumpkin Hunt

Frightfully Fun themed trivia

Patch’s Spook-tacular Bingo

Frightfully Fun dance class

Guess That Frightful Song Line Up

Youth Activities include: Family Trick or Treat kids Costume Contest and Teen Halloween Party

13 Carnival cruise ships will offer the experience including the additional ships that will restart operations in October including Carnival Freedom from Miami and Carnival Elation out of Port Canaveral. Mardi Gras Carnival’s new flagship will also feature Halloween specials for the first time starting from October 2.

NCL Resumes From New York City

Norwegian Breakaway became the first in the fleet to resume sailings from New York City. Oasis of the Seas has been operating Bahamas cruises from Bayonne New Jersey since early September so cruise passengers in the region now have an even wider choice of epic cruise ships to choose from.

The 3963-passenger Breakaway-class ship restarted operations on September 26 and welcomed guests back on board for the first time in over a year. Norwegian Breakaway will sail on six week-long cruises to Bermuda with overnights to the Royal Navy DockYard. The ship will then embark on its repositioning 14-day voyage followed by the start of sailings from New Orleans on November 7.

Norwegian Breakaway is the sixth of the Company’s 17-ship fleet to redeploy since July 25 2021 when Norwegian Jade was the first to set sail with seven-day itineraries to the Greek Isles after a 500-day suspension. Norwegian Encore became the first ship in the NCL fleet to return to cruising from the U.S. on August 7 2021.

Russians to celebrate WWII victory on Vienna‘s streets. Ukraine asks authorities to ban events.

ADVERTISEMENT

Hundreds of Russians marched through Vienna to celebrate the victory over Nazi Germany. Ukraine had asked Austria's authorities to ban the anniversary celebrations without success. Some of the participants were highly critical of Europe and Ukraine.

Just like in previous years Ukraine was again unable to obtain a ban on this event in Vienna. According to the Ukrainian embassy this celebration is anti-democratic and a mockery of all Ukrainians who are currently dying in the Russian war in Ukraine.

A Ukrainian protest was held right next to the anniversary celebration. Tetiana Bilyk a Viennese resident from Ukraine said: ‘We must mourn but not celebrate. There is nothing to celebrate. We must remember the victims and not spread Putin's propaganda. This is Putin's propaganda. He is abusing this important day.’

For example although software-as-a-service business Salesforce.com lost money for years while it grew recurring revenue if you held shares since 2005 you'd have done very well indeed. Nonetheless only a fool would ignore the risk that a loss making company burns through its cash too quickly.

So the natural question for Beam Global (NASDAQ:BEEM) shareholders is whether they should be concerned by its rate of cash burn. In this article we define cash burn as its annual (negative) free cash flow which is the amount of money a company spends each year to fund its growth. Let's start with an examination of the business' cash relative to its cash burn.

See our latest analysis for Beam Global

How Long Is Beam Global's Cash Runway?

You can calculate a company's cash runway by dividing the amount of cash it has by the rate at which it is spending that cash. In June 2021 Beam Global had US$25m in cash and was debt-free. Looking at the last year the company burnt through US$5.9m. That means it had a cash runway of about 4.3 years as of June 2021. Importantly though analysts think that Beam Global will reach cashflow breakeven before then. If that happens then the length of its cash runway today would become a moot point. You can see how its cash balance has changed over time in the image below.

How Well Is Beam Global Growing?

Some investors might find it troubling that Beam Global is actually increasing its cash burn which is up 28% in the last year. The good news is that operating revenue increased by 37% in the last year indicating that the business is gaining some traction. Considering the factors above the company doesn’t fare badly when it comes to assessing how it is changing over time. While the past is always worth studying it is the future that matters most of all. For that reason it makes a lot of sense to take a look at our analyst forecasts for the company.

Can Beam Global Raise More Cash Easily?

While Beam Global seems to be in a decent position we reckon it is still worth thinking about how easily it could raise more cash if that proved desirable. Issuing new shares or taking on debt are the most common ways for a listed company to raise more money for its business. One of the main advantages held by publicly listed companies is that they can sell shares to investors to raise cash and fund growth. We can compare a company's cash burn to its market capitalisation to get a sense for how many new shares a company would have to issue to fund one year's operations.

Beam Global's cash burn of US$5.9m is about 2.3% of its US$252m market capitalisation. So it could almost certainly just borrow a little to fund another year's growth or else easily raise the cash by issuing a few shares.

How Risky Is Beam Global's Cash Burn Situation?

As you can probably tell by now we're not too worried about Beam Global's cash burn. For example we think its cash runway suggests that the company is on a good path. Although its increasing cash burn does give us reason for pause the other metrics we discussed in this article form a positive picture overall. One real positive is that analysts are forecasting that the company will reach breakeven. After taking into account the various metrics mentioned in this report we're pretty comfortable with how the company is spending its cash as it seems on track to meet its needs over the medium term. Taking an in-depth view of risks we've identified 2 warning signs for Beam Global that you should be aware of before investing.

Sonora.- Uno de los triunfos más recientes de la lucha Yaqui por defender su territorio empezó desde 2014 año en que los habitantes de la Loma de Bácum se opusieron a la construcción del Gasoducto Sonora que recorre desde Guaymas hasta el poblado de El Oro Sinaloa. De sus 331 kilómetros 90 se extendían a lo largo del territorio Yaqui.

A causa de los conflictos sociales que ha generado la construcción de los gasoductos Guaymas-El Oro y que va de Tuxpan Veracruz hacia Tula Hidalgo la Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) informó que se harán cambios de rutas para concluir las construcciones

Además la CFE indicó que se encuentra negociando para que sea ella quien concluya los tramos faltantes la cual se encargará de la inversión que podría superar los 300 millones de dólares para ambos tramos los cuales suman un total de 210 kilómetros.

La obra Guaymas-El Oro para distribuir gas natural está a cargo de la empresa IEnova y ha provocado constantes enfrentamientos con la Tribu Yaqui debido a que el gasoducto estaba planeado para que cruzara por su territorio y los habitantes alegaron que podría convertirse en un riesgo para ellos.

De acuerdo con Miguel Santiago Reyes director general de las filiales CF Energía y CFE Internacional en una reunión con el pueblo indígena el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador ofreció hacer un cambio de trazado de entre 70 y 90 kilómetros según la nueva ruta que se planee.

En el caso de Guaymas-El Oro es un problema con la comunidad Loma de Bácum a quién respetamos y ya estamos trabajando con ellos para que pueda cambiarse el trazo conforme a un acuerdo; este tramo lo va a construir CFE va a ser propiedad de la Comisión. Aún no se ha hecho nada pero ya estamos en un proceso de negociación"" dijo Miguel Santiago.

La estatal ha decidido modificar las rutas por donde pasarán los gasoductos para lograr que estos sean concluidos antes de 2024 cuando termine el actual sexenio detalló Reyes Hernández.

La historia del conflictivo proyecto

En la última década el mercado internacional y mexicano de gas natural se ha caracterizado por un mayor consumo resultado de los beneficios ecológicos y económicos que ofrece respecto a otros combustibles lo que lo ha llevado a convertirse en la tercera fuente de energía primaria más importante de consumo.

El transporte de gas natural a través del territorio nacional se efectúa por medio de un sistema integrado por gasoductos de diferentes diámetros y longitudes trampas de diablos válvulas de seccionamiento válvulas troncales pasos aéreos y cruces de ríos de carreteras y de ferrocarriles. La red de gasoductos del país está constituida por el Sistema Nacional de Gasoductos (SNG) y el sistema Naco-Hermosillo ambos pertenecientes a PEMEX Gas y Petroquímica Básica (PGPB). Asimismo lo integran gasoductos privados en algunos casos fronterizos interconectados con el sur de Estados Unidos otros conectados al SNG o aislados.

Hasta hace diez años la región noroeste del país se caracterizaba porque no se encontraba conectada al Sistema Nacional de Gasoductos (SNG) y por ende no tenía acceso a la producción nacional. Así el consumo regional total hasta 2007 había sido abastecido por importaciones provenientes del sur de EUA hacia Baja California y Sonora debido a que éstos cuentan con infraestructura de suministro del hidrocarburo. En 2008 la región diversifica su abastecimiento con la entrada en operación de la Terminal de GNL de Ensenada en el estado de Baja California.

En octubre de 2012 la división mexicana de Sempra International firmó un contrato por 25 años con la Comisión Federal de Electricidad de México para construir poseer y operar el proyecto Guaymas-El Oro. El gasoducto cuya construcción estuvo lista en gran parte para mayo de 2017 se interconecta con el de El Oro-Mazatlán y está trazado para ser un componente fundamental del sistema de distribución de gas natural para el norte-noroeste de México.

La construcción del gasoducto Guaymas-El Oro se basaba en el argumento de que el crecimiento de la demanda de gas natural en la región noroeste sería considerable. Según las estimaciones hechas por las autoridades en 2011 en el caso específico de Sonora la demanda de Gas Natural aumentará 10.6 por ciento promedio anual en el periodo 2011-2026. En Sinaloa que inició su consumo eléctrico de gas natural en 2015 mostrará una tasa media de crecimiento anual de 38.2 por ciento hasta el final del periodo.

EI proyecto original de gasoducto Guaymas-El Dorado tiene contemplado recorrer el trayecto entre Sonora y Sinaloa pasando por los municipios sonorenses de Guaymas Empalme Bacum Cajeme Navojoa Huatabampo y Álamos y El Fuerte en el estado de Sinaloa para el Trazo Guaymas

Tres meses después de que entrara en operaciones el primer tramo del gasoducto en agosto de 2017 su funcionamiento se detuvo luego de un sabotaje cometido por grupos del pueblo yaqui que se oponían a su operación.

El gasoducto Guaymas-El Oro estaba diseñado para medir 330 kilómetros 18 de los cuales atravesarán el territorio de la comunidad yaqui de Loma de Bácum. Este proyecto forma parte en realidad de uno mayor el Gasoducto Sonora de 835 kilómetros en total que contempla la construcción de otro tramo el de Guaymas-El Sásabe con una extensión de 505 kilómetros.

El territorio intocable

Si hay algo que se ha mantenido constante en la historia del pueblo Yaqui durante siglos es la lucha por la defensa de su territorio y recursos naturales. Los últimos tres lustros han sido de esa manera una batalla continúa por la sobrevivencia y el respeto a sus tierras.

Desde 2010 con el Acueducto Independencia en 2013 con el Gasoducto de Sonora hace cuatro años en 2017 cuando el consumo de drogas aumentó dentro de la etnia y ahora en 2021 luchan contra los proyectos de extracción de minerales y el asedio del crimen organizado.

Desde 2014 los habitantes de la Loma de Bácum se opusieron a la construcción del Gasoducto Sonora tramo Guaymas-El Oro de 90 kilómetros de largo en el territorio Yaqui administrado por la empresa IEnova la cual es filial de la transnacional Sempra Energy en Estados Unidos.

Durante seis años los habitantes de Loma de Bácum vivieron constantes amenazas por oponerse ejemplo de ello es el encarcelamiento de Fidencio Aldama. Hasta el 21 de octubre de 2016 cuando dos facciones se enfrentaron en la comunidad dejando como saldo dos muertos 10 heridos 11 vehículos quemados y una tubería arrancada una parte de la comunidad sustentaba que el proyecto gasífero amenazaba la vida de 20 mil personas para el otro grupo el ducto traería desarrollo.

En 2017 la etnia ganó un amparo ante el juzgado séptimo del distrito de Ciudad de Obregón la obra quedó suspendida hasta tener el consentimiento de los ocho pueblos.

Los integrantes del pueblo originario dicen que jamás acordaron la construcción de una sección de gasoducto que cruce por su territorio. En una protesta en agosto de 2017 los integrantes de la comunidad utilizaron una retroexcavadora para extraer 8 metros de la obra lo que interrumpió la operación y perpetuó la batalla legal en curso con IEnova.

El 14 de junio en base al Plan de Justicia para la Tribu Yaqui el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador ofreció desviar el gasoducto afirmando que tenían que llegar a acuerdos por el beneficio de México ya que “el presupuesto no es dinero del Gobierno es dinero del pueblo” y se comprometió a desviar el tramo del gasoducto para evitar el estancamiento del tramo Guaymas-El Oro.

¿Por qué hay protestas? Porque no se les consultó se tomaron acuerdos se hicieron negocios sobre todo empresas particulares aseguraron la venta de gas a la Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE)"" comentó el presidente sobre el gasoducto en su conferencia de prensa matutina del 7 de agosto desde Baja California Sur.

Ese mismo día López Obrador explicó que anteriormente se firmaron contratos entre empresas y la Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) para la compra de gas y la construcción de gasoductos cuyos contratos fueron leoninos porque fueron jugosos para las empresas.

Añadió que dichos contratos fueron malos para la hacienda pública puesto que al final cuando estos terminen los gasoductos no serán de la CFE sino que se los quedarán las empresas y le encargó a la comisión asuma la responsabilidad porque los yaquis ""no quieren nada con las empresas"" debido al trato que se le dio a la comunidad.

¿Qué sigue?

La tribu logró la cancelación del proyecto que será desviado por la Sierra del Bacatete pese a que solo faltaban siete kilómetros de interconexión lo que implica un elevadísimo costo que absorberá la CFE y las posibles demandas que vengan de la constructora.

Aunque faltaban seis kilómetros se proyecta que con la nueva ruta de Guaymas-El Oro se tendrán que construir entre 70 y 90 ligeramente abajo del rango de 90 y 120 kilómetros estimados para el gasoducto de Tuxpan-Tula.

El director de CFE Internacional y CFE Energía Miguel Santiago Reyes refirió que la construcción de un kilómetro de gasoducto ronda entre un millón y millón y medio de dólares. De esta forma la desviación del tramo Guaymas-El Oro podría salir hasta dos mil 500 millones de pesos más cara que siguiendo su ruta original.

Para la construcción de los tramos que restan de estos gasoductos la CFE busca asociarse con las empresas a cargo evaluación que ya autorizó su Consejo de Administración. Hasta ahora ninguna de las concesionarias se ha pronunciado contra las modificaciones anunciadas por la comisión.

Al anunciar la nueva ruta Miguel Alejandro López López subdirector de Contratación y Servicios de CFE detalló que cuando inició la presente administración había siete gasoductos para uso pendientes y se ha resuelto la problemática de cuatro.

Dijo que en la pasada administración hubo una falta de planeación significativa pues cuando se implementó el plan de infraestructura a partir de 2013 se hizo de forma masiva para comunicar las plantas de generación de electricidad. El proyecto denuncia se habría desarrollado sin cuidado ni con una planeación necesaria para utilizar de forma eficiente lo que sería la capacidad contratada.

También explicó que gracias a la renegociación de cinco contratos de transporte de gas natural se tuvo un ahorro por cuatro mil 342 millones de dólares; el gasoducto de IEnova 287 millones de dólares; Gaza con 33 millones de dólares; sistema TGNH con 839 millones de dólares; Terminal de Licuefacción de Altamira (TLA) con 370 millones de dólares; e ingresos adicionales por suministro de molécula con 300 millones de dólares.

In a few seconds its glory days were over and the place once known as the ‘wickedest city on Earth’ became a shadow of itself.

Across the harbour there was a swathe of land called Colonel Barry’s Hog Crawle a piggery to where some of the quake survivors fled. The place was covered with trees and grass pieces some of which was cleared for settlement. In 1703 a great fire consumed what was left of the buildings in Port Royal. Colonel Barry’s Hog Crawle was once again a refuge which was now marked off into streets and lanes.

That was the beginning of the establishment of the town of Kingston which became a city in 1803 and the permanent capital of Jamaica in 1873. It merged with St Andrew in 1923 to become the Kingston and St Andrew Corporation. This urban space is an architectural mélange. Most of the old buildings in the downtown area are from the art décor era.

These structures have been decaying for quite a long while. Some have collapsed/crumbled. Others are collapsing/crumbling. There are unsightly shells uncomely edifices and unwelcoming façades. Apart from the high-rises near the waterfront the buildings in downtown Kingston are really unsightly not a sight for sore eyes. And for years concerned stakeholders have been tooting the horn for the redevelopment of downtown Kingston but there seems to be much foot-dragging.

Kingston Creative (KC) is covering up some of the decay with sights murals for the sore eyes under its transformative Paint the City programme. “The organisation’s goals are the development of an art district and creative hub in downtown Kingston to transform the ‘old city’ into a regional and international focal point for arts and culture” revealed Andrea Dempster-Chung the executive director of KC.

The programme started in 2018 behind Swiss Stores along Water Lane between Church Street and Temple Lane. The project was funded by the Tourism Enhancement Fund in 2019 to create a “walkable cultural tour”. “The goal is to connect the iconic cultural spaces of the National Gallery of Art on Orange Street and the Institute of Jamaica and national museums on East Street” Dempster-Chung said.

MORE MURALS

More murals will be established between King and Orange streets and from Duke to East streets. The third phase of murals starts in the fourth quarter of this year and will commemorate Jamaican cultural icons in music dance literature film theatre and fashion. Paving lighting sidewalk rehabilitation art sculpture and other infrastructure are being implemented by the Duke Street Renewal Programme Kingston Restoration Company and the Kingston and St Andrew Municipal Corporation.

Dempster-Chung described the artistic/cultural thrust as a “ground-up approach in stark contrast to many of the top-down plans that have been proposed to redevelop Downtown”. “It is a process that starts with community sensitisation identifying artists from the communities to be a part of the process and then enrolling partners from the public sector private sector (businesses with a stake in downtown Kingston) and third-sector entities (foundations and NGOs). It is very important to have a broad base of support so that there is continuity and sustainability built in” she explained.

This broad-base support is essential for such a far-reaching undertaking as this requires much financing thus the challenge of raising funds. “But we do have funders that see the long-term vision and the transformation that is possible for Downtown and we are really grateful for their support” Dempster-Chung disclosed while revealing a list of sponsors. Also getting all the players on the same page and pulling in the same direction takes time and much effort. Even the fragmentation of the physical space is a factor “with invisible garrison lines dividing it into 20 discrete communities”.

There are plans to expand the project and embedded in this expansion is technology. The murals have an added Augmented Reality animation that use an app Artivive and a mobile device to deliver an enhanced experience to the visitor. A virtual reality tour (www.kingstoncreative.org/virtual-tour) has also been developed to allow remote visitors to the explore the Water Lane Artwalk destination and advertising the location.

The next phase is the development of a cultural app funded by the International Development Bank and the Development Bank of Jamaica and which allows for booking of tours ecommerce for creatives and easy navigation of the district. “Technology is going to be a key tool in driving our natural talent forward and in growing the visitors to Downtown. This will all be important to have in place post-COVID to propel the creative economy forward and support a diverse economic recovery” Dempster-Chung said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Details of the purchase are contained in the Pandora papers which reveal how a network of offshore companies linked to the family and associates of the Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev has traded close to £400m of UK property over the past 15 years.

The property purchases include one building acquired for £33.5m in 2009 by an offshore company beneficially owned by President Aliyev’s son Heydar who was then only 11 years old.

The revelations raise questions about potential loopholes in the UK’s property registration system and whether they prevent proper due diligence even by a body such as the crown estate nominally owned by the UK monarch and run by commissioners for the benefit of the nation’s finances.

Quick Guide What are the Pandora papers? Show The Pandora papers are the largest trove of leaked data exposing tax haven secrecy in history. They provide a rare window into the hidden world of offshore finance casting light on the financial secrets of some of the world’s richest people. The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) which shared access with the Guardian BBC and other media outlets around the world. In total the trove consists of 11.9m files leaked from a total of 14 offshore service providers totalling 2.94 terabytes of information. That makes it larger in volume than both the Panama papers (2016) and Paradise papers (2017) two previous offshore leaks. Where did the Pandora documents come from? The ICIJ a Washington DC-based journalism nonprofit is not identifying the source of the leaked documents. In order to facilitate a global investigation the ICIJ gave remote access to the documents to journalists in 117 countries including reporters at the Washington Post Le Monde El País Süddeutsche Zeitung PBS Frontline and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In the UK the investigation has been led by the Guardian and BBC Panorama. What is an offshore service provider? The 14 offshore service providers in the leak provide corporate services to individuals or companies seeking to do business offshore. Their clients are typically seeking to discreetly set up companies or trusts in lightly regulated tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands (BVI) Panama the Cook Islands and the US state of South Dakota. Companies registered offshore can be used to hold assets such as property aircraft yachts and investments in stocks and shares. By holding those assets in an offshore company it is possible to hide from the rest of the world the identity of the person they actually belong to or the “beneficial owner”. Why do people move money offshore? Usually for reasons of tax secrecy or regulation. Offshore jurisdictions tend to have no income or corporation taxes which makes them potentially attractive to wealthy individuals and companies who don’t want to pay taxes in their home countries. Although morally questionable this kind of tax avoidance can be legal. Offshore jurisdictions also tend to be highly secretive and publish little or no information about the companies or trusts incorporated there. This can make them useful to criminals such as tax evaders or money launderers who need to hide money from tax or law enforcement authorities. It is also true that people in corrupt or unstable countries may use offshore providers to put their assets beyond the reach of repressive governments or criminal adversaries who may try to seize them or to seek to circumvent hard currency restrictions. Others may go offshore for reasons of inheritance or estate planning. Has everyone named in the Pandora papers done something wrong? No. Moving money offshore is not in or of itself illegal and there are legitimate reasons why some people do it. Not everyone named in the Pandora papers is suspected of wrongdoing. Those who are may stand accused of a wide range of misbehaviour: from the morally questionable through to the potentially criminal. The Guardian is only publishing stories based on leaked documents after considering the public interest. That is a broad concept that may include furthering transparency by revealing the secret offshore owners of UK property even where those owners have done nothing wrong. Other articles might illuminate issues of important public debate raise moral questions shed light on how the offshore industry operates or help inform voters about politicians or donors in the interests of democratic accountability. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

A spokesperson for the estate which manages £15bn of property assets said: “Before our purchase of [the building] we conducted checks including those required by UK law. At the time we did not establish any reason why the transaction should not proceed. Given the potential concerns raised we are looking into the matter.”

Aliyev has ruled Azerbaijan since succeeding his father as president in 2003 and has presided over a country that is frequently accused of human rights abuses rigged elections and systemic corruption.

In 2015 a European parliament resolution called on “EU authorities to conduct a thorough investigation into the corruption allegations against President Aliyev and members of his family” following a series of stories by Azerbaijani investigative journalists accusing the first family of personally benefiting from state contracts and business deals.

In 2017 the human rights campaign group Freedom House also criticised the country for “widespread and pervasive” corruption in a report. “As long as the ruling elites continue to enrich themselves at the expense of the public purse government anti-corruption measures will have limited impact” it said.

In August 2018 the crown estate paid £66.5m for 56-60 Conduit Street an eight-storey office and retailing property in London’s Mayfair which it bought from a British Virgin Islands-based company called Hiniz Trade & Investment.

Hiniz had acquired the building for £35.5m in 2009 and the Pandora papers show how the ownership of the company was passed from the president’s daughter Arzu Aliyeva to her grandfather Arif Pashayev who then placed the company into a trust in 2015.

The leaked files do not show the source of the funds originally injected into Hiniz but disclosure of the company’s shareholders – and the manner in which ownership was switched between members of Azerbaijan’s first family – raises fresh questions about whether the transaction should be investigated on money-laundering concerns.

Dylan Kennedy a former UK law enforcement officer and director of the financial due diligence company Intelpool said: “The onward sale of any property that had originally been purchased with potentially dirty funds completes the money laundering cycle by providing a fresh paper trail that effectively legitimises the proceeds. In this case if the source of funds is shown to be questionable the sale of a property to the crown estate is the pinnacle of legitimisation.”

The crown estate said it had been “provided with details of the ultimate beneficial owner of Hiniz Trade and Investment Limited but no other ownership details”.

The deal is not the first time the Aliyev family’s London property investments have caused controversy.

In 2018 the Solicitors Regulation Authority fined a London solicitor £45000 for failings connected to the property investments of President Aliyev’s daughters Leyla and Arzu Aliyeva. The tribunal found the solicitor had failed to conduct enhanced due diligence in a case that should have raised money-laundering risks.

The UK government has repeatedly promised to introduce a compulsory register of overseas owners of property in the country amid concern that vast swathes of real estate are secretly held by owners who hide behind shell companies in tax havens.

The Pandora papers have removed some of that invisibility revealing for the first time how between 2006 and 2017 the Aliyevs and associates spent £389m secretly acquiring 27 properties using a network of offshore companies. Twelve of those properties have since been sold for a combined total of £374m.

Properties that the documents show the Aliyev-connected offshore companies still own include: a house in an exclusive new-build Kensington development where homes are advertised with features including a swimming pool Jacuzzi and a gym/cinema and which Land Registry records state was bought for £29.3m in 2012; and three apartments in an exclusive Knightsbridge block located within metres of the department store Harrods and Hyde Park which were acquired for about £5m in 2006.

The Aliyev family did not respond to efforts to contact them.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Kourtney Kardashian 42 and boyfriend Travis Barker 45 have been dubbed as 'embarrassing and crass' after posting a photo that hinted they had just had sex.

The loved-up couple who are prone to PDA appeared to hint that they had just had sex in a cryptic Instagram snap posted onto Travis' stories.

The 45-year-old Blink-182 drummer took to Instagram on Saturday to share a photo of what appeared to be his and his girlfriend's clothes strewn across the floor.

In the snap you could clearly see a black shirt on the floor a tiny white lace undergarment on the sofa and a few other items of clothing were draped over the back of the couch too.

Fans and critiques of the Kardashians rushed to social media sites to discuss the cryptic snap with many heading to Reddit to share their views.

One fan shared the photo and made a thread on the site named: We get it you guys love to f**k.

Within hours the thread was filled with criticism with many fans expressing how they believed the post to be unnecessary and 'crass'.

One said: ""I would be so embarrassed and sick if my parents acted like this on instagram like i would probably not be on social media.""

Another said: ""This is cringe and it would be no matter the age. It also feel very performative. Like trying to make a point...""

A third wrote: ""This is extremely weird and inappropriate. They’re always wanting privacy but yet here is Travis giving out pictures of very intimate moments. No one needs to see this.""

And a fourth chimed in: “That is just so immature and crass.”

While a fifth said: ""100% it’s like an obnoxious teen couple starving for attention.""

This comes as speculation continues to spiral surrounding rumours that the couple might be expecting their first child together.

Kourtney has recently fuelled the rumours when she and Megan Fox referred to their boyfriends as their 'future baby daddies' while attending the VMAs earlier on in the year.

The Keeping Up With The Kardashian's star continued to stir up the rumours when she documented receiving a delivery from Buy Buy Baby.

If the rumours are true and the couple are expecting this would be their first child together. But the pair do already have children from previous relationships.

CORONATION Street actress Georgia Taylor flashed a huge grin as she snuggled up to husband Mark Letheren for a chilly holiday snap.

The screen stars had taken a trip to the Lake District a short drive from the soap's Weatherfield set for some quality time together.

Georgia 41 whose happy demeanour was a stark contrast to that of her troubled Corrie character Toyah Battersby wore her hair in playful plait pig-tales and huge sunglasses for their sweet shot.

Staying snug in a black coat and matching handbag she wrapped her arm around the former Casualty actor 50 who wore a dark leather jacket.

They posed for a series of shots at Ullswater in the stunning Lakes with the glistening water and tree scenery behind them.

Georgia added a few extra snaps of their staycation and wrote in the caption: ""All of the weather and all of the walks. With my one @markletheren 💜#thelakes.""

Mark is familiar to telly fans from his stint in ITV's The Bill and BBC's Casualty where the couple met.

LOVED UP

Georgia and Mark who juggles his acting job with being a photographer met on the Casualty set in 2008.

The northern screen star had joined the medical drama a year earlier as Ruth Winters while Mark played Ben Harding.

They then married shortly after their romance blossomed.

HOW OLD?

Georgia recently stunned Corrie fans as she revealed her real age.

The Cobbles legend had been chatting online about a vile remark directed at her character Toyah Battersby about how she dressed in 1997 when she first entered the soap.

The offensive tweet has since been deleted but it left Georgia fuming.

She branded the user a ""pervert"" before she blocked them as she said: ""In Classic Corrie I was playing a 15 year old schoolgirl but hey whatever floats your massive pervy boat.""

Dozens of followers praised her for calling out the troll as Georgia went on to reveal her actual age.

She added: ""I’m 41 tmrw hun and I’ve had enough of this s**t""

Hearing the number surprised many of her followers with one writing on the Twitter thread: ""You go legend.

""Also how the HELL are you 41? I will order you some birthday flapjack.""

Another raved: ""defo would never have guessed you were 41 now @RealGeorgiaT wow!! Love you and @RealJaneDanson and personally think you've both only got better with age :) its been fab seeing you both on classic Corrie ep's again and always loved your characters""

Toyah Battersby first came to the Street in 1997 with the rest of her family Leanne Les and Janice.

She was a bit of a wild child but won over fans hearts.

In 2001 Georgia won the Best Dramatic Performance award at the British Soap Awards following her character’s horrific rape storyline.

In 2016 it was announced that Georgia would be reprising her role as Toyah and she returned to the cobbles on Christmas Day 2016.

In true Holly Willoughby fashion she can't upload a picture to ‘the gram’ without the comments section descending into chaos.

Fans were much more interested in the lovely nature she was surrounded by.

One follower wrote: “Shame that your team didn’t realise that you can clearly see vehicles passing by on a road that’s behind your set position !! And why talk negatives when you have nature all around you silence & listen to the woodland sounds & smell just breathe in the fresh air good innit!!!!”

(AP) -- Crude was no longer leaking from a Southern California pipeline believed to be the source of a massive oil spill that closed miles of popular beaches on Sunday according to the head of the company that owns the facility.

Divers were still trying to determine where and why the leak occurred but the flow of oil was stopped late Saturday from the line that runs under the ocean off Huntington Beach said Amplify Energy CEO Martyn Willsher.

At least 126000 gallons (572807 liters) of crude spilled into the waters off Orange County starting late Friday or early Saturday when boaters began reporting a sheen in the water officials said.

""I don't expect it to be more. That's the capacity of the entire pipeline"" Willsher said at a Sunday news conference. He said the pipeline was suctioned out and dozens of nearby oil platforms operated by Amplify were shut down.

It was one of the largest oil spills in recent Southern California history fouling the strand in Huntington Beach the town known as Surf City USA. Crews scrambled to contain the crude before it spread further into protected wetlands.

Huntington Beach Mayor Kim Carr said the city's famous beaches could remain closed for weeks or even months.

""This oil spill constitutes one of the most devastating situations that our community has dealt with in decades"" Carr said.

The oil created a miles-wide sheen in the ocean and washed ashore in sticky black globules along with dead birds and fish officials said. Crews led by the U.S. Coast Guard deployed skimmers and floating barriers known as booms to try to stop further incursion into the wetlands and the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve.

A petroleum stench permeated the air throughout the area said Orange County Supervisor Katrina Foley.

""You get the taste in the mouth just from the vapors in the air"" she said.

The closure included all of Huntington Beach about 6 miles (9.66 kilometers) south to the Santa Ana River jetty amid summerlike weather that would have brought big crowds to the wide strand for volleyball swimming and surfing. Yellow caution tape was strung between lifeguard towers to keep people away.

Officials canceled the final day of the annual Pacific Air Show that typically draws thousands of spectators to Huntington Beach a city of about 199000 residents about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of downtown Los Angeles. The show featured flyovers by the U.S. Navy Blue Angels and the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds.

The oil slick originated from a broken pipeline connected to an offshore oil platform known as Elly Foley said on Twitter. Elly is connected by walkway to another platform Ellen located just over 8.5 miles (about 14 kilometers) off Long Beach according to the federal Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.

Foley said Newport Beach Mayor Brad Avery told her that he encountered the oil slick while in a boat traveling back to the mainland from Santa Catalina Island. ""He saw dolphins swimming thru the oil"" Foley tweeted.

Huntington Beach resident David Rapchun said he's worried about the impact of the spill on the beaches where he grew up as well as the local economy.

""For the amount of oil these things produce I don't think it's worth the risk"" Rapchun said. ""I'm sure they have long leases but push come to shove these things can change.""

He questioned whether drilling for oil was a wise idea along some of Southern California's most scenic beaches noting the loss of the final day of the air show could deal a blow to the local economy.

""We need oil but there's always a question: Do we need it there?"" he wondered.

The spill comes three decades after a massive oil leak hit the same stretch of Orange County coast. On Feb. 7 1990 the oil tanker American Trader ran over its anchor off Huntington Beach spilling nearly 417000 gallons (1.6 million liters) of crude. Fish and about 3400 birds were killed.

In 2015 a ruptured pipeline north of Santa Barbara sent 143000 gallons (541313 liters) of crude oil gushing onto Refugio State Beach.

At a news conference Saturday night Orange County officials expressed concern about the environmental impacts of the spill and hoped crews could stop the oil before it flowed into sensitive wetlands.

""We've been working with our federal state and county partners to mitigate the impact that could be a potential ecological disaster"" Huntington Beach Mayor Kim Carr said.

The area is home to threatened and endangered species -- including a plump shorebird called the snowy plover the California least tern and humpback whales -- a fishing industry and migratory birds on the Pacific Flyway.

""The coastal areas off of Southern California are just really rich for wildlife a key biodiversity hot spot"" said Miyoko Sakashita director of the Center for Biological Diversity's oceans program.

The effects of an oil spill are wide-ranging environmentalists said. Birds that get oil on their feathers can't fly can't clean themselves and can't monitor their own temperatures Sakashita said. Whales dolphins and other sea creatures can have trouble breathing or die after swimming through oil or breathing in toxic fumes she said.

""The oil spill just shows how dirty and dangerous oil drilling is and oil that gets into the water. It's impossible to clean it up so it ends up washing up on our beaches and people come into contact with it and wildlife comes in contact with it"" she said. ""It has long-lasting effects on the breeding and reproduction of animals. It's really sad to see this broad swatch oiled.""

This article examines recent employment declines in rail transportation a small but important component of the transportation and warehousing industry. Although employment in rail transportation remained relatively stable for most of the past 25 years it declined by 40000 jobs from November 2018 to December 2020. This article provides an analysis of the recent employment declines in the rail transportation industry.

After remaining stable for over two decades employment in the rail transportation industry began to decrease in November 2018 according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey.1 By December 2020 the industry had lost 40000 jobs. (See chart 1.) Many sources including both the public media and rail industry experts attributed the beginning of the industry’s employment losses to three main factors: the decline of the reliance on coal as a natural resource an uncertain trade environment and a new method of operations adopted by railroads called Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR). In addition a fourth factor the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic further exacerbated job losses in the industry.

Within the transportation and warehousing industry rail transportation is one of the smallest component industries in terms of employment. In fact rail transportation made up only 3 percent of transportation and warehousing employment as of November 2018 but the industry accounted for 33 percent of the 121000 jobs lost between November 2018 and December 2020. (See table 1 and chart 2.) Employment in rail transportation declined consistently throughout 2019 and into the beginning of 2020 accelerated in April and May of that year and then leveled off through December.

Table 1. Industry composition of transportation and warehousing November 2018 Section Percent Air transportation 8.9 Rail transportation 3.3 Water transportation 1.2 Truck transportation 27.3 Transit and ground passenger transportation 8.9 Pipeline transportation 0.9 Scenic and sightseeing transportation 0.6 Support activities for transportation 13.5 Couriers and messengers 14.1 Warehousing and storage 21.1

The decline of coal

In 2019 U.S. railroads moved 4 million carloads of coal with each carrying enough coal to power 19 homes for an entire year. Five states accounted for approximately 71 percent of U.S. coal production in 2019 despite coal being consumed all over the country.2 However because of recent advances in natural gas extraction and the increased use of renewable resources to generate electricity the United States is becoming less reliant on coal as an energy source.3 In fact the movement of millions of coal carloads in 2019 actually represented a decline of 405000 or 9.2 percent over the year. According to Association of American Railroads (AAR) Vice President John T. Gray the number of coal carloads in 2019 were the lowest they had been in decades.4 With the United States relying less on coal the demand for rail cars that transport coal decreases. In turn there is a decrease in the need for rail cars overall as well as the need for employees to work on the railroads.

In 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic added to the decline in the use of coal as business closures shelter-in-place mandates and generally low demand from the public weakened the overall economy. In addition cheap natural gas prices prompted the increased use of natural gas instead of coal to generate electricity deepening the decline in the number of coal carloads further. As of April 25 2020 when the tightest of COVID-19 restrictions across the United States were still in effect coal was down 21.4 percent over the year.5 As shown in chart 3 the decline accelerated in the beginning of 2020.6 In fact the 2-month period (April and May 2020) in which the largest percentage declines in the number of coal carloads occurred corresponded with the rail industry’s largest over-the-month declines in employment. In addition once the country began to reopen in the summer the number of coal carloads began to increase and rail employment returned to smaller monthly declines. Although coal carloads do not correlate with rail employment on a month-by-month basis it is evident that reductions in coal carloads have a negative influence on rail employment.

An uncertain trade environment

Businesses strive to make efficient use of their time money and other resources and changes in the demand for rail transportation and impacts on their revenues as a result of trade uncertainties can impact the industry’s employment. Rail freight volumes and movement—how often trains are moving freight from one point to another—have recently been reduced by an uncertain trade environment involving the negotiations of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and trade relations between the United States and China. According to AAR economist Luisa Fernandez-Willey trade uncertainty and tariffs had a strong negative effect on the rail transportation industry in 2019 as 42 percent of rail carloads and intermodal units (units using two modes of freight such as truck and rail to transport goods) and 35 percent of annual rail revenue are associated with international trade.7 In addition about 50000 jobs worth over $5.5 billion in annual wages and benefits also depend on international trade.8 The relationship between rail carloads and international trade is strongly tied to employment as fewer carloads and lower revenue tied to international trade mean a reduced need for workers.

Even general uncertainty resulting from the United States’ trade relationships with other countries can lead to the hesitance of firms to hire and thus the USMCA and trade relations with China have been widely referenced in analyzing rail employment declines in 2019. Fernandez-Willey noted that clarity on trade would be vital for the rail industry to recover in 2020 stating that the ratification of the USMCA and the resolution of disputes with China would be the key factors to achieving this clarity.9

In 2019 uncertainty that is due to the ongoing disputes between the United States and China lowered demand for companies that move freight especially within the agriculture and manufacturing industries.10 These disputes included the United States and China imposing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other’s goods. Tensions ran especially high in 2019 with the two countries spending the last few months of the year threatening to impose new tariffs and increase existing tariffs against one another.11 Uncertainty appeared to grow out of the USMCA’s delayed ratification as well with the final outcome of the agreement relatively unclear for most of the year. In December 2019 the U.S. House of Representatives passed the USMCA which established key policy changes.12

In January 2020 it appeared trade uncertainty and its negative effect on rail employment may have started to fade once a phase-one trade deal with China was established and the USMCA was signed into law.13 However the positive outlook for trade and rail employment did not last long into 2020 once the COVID-19 pandemic began. Global trade and shipment volumes were disrupted throughout the year as people across the world stayed at home and quarantined in an effort to contain the virus. The Cass Freight Index for April 2020 released at the height of the U.S. stay-at-home orders is particularly revealing as it reported that shipment volumes dropped 22.7 percent and freight expenditures fell 18.2 percent year-over-year in North America.14 The COVID-19 recession appears to have held back improvements to trade uncertainty as little has changed regarding U.S. trade relations with China since the start of the pandemic.15 Recessions are also typically characterized by a surge in trade disputes and a slowdown in trade negotiations as rising unemployment heightens uncertainty.16

Precision Scheduled Railroading

Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) is a railroad strategy that uses departure schedules and point-to-point delivery methods to achieve low operating ratios (how much a company needs to spend to make a dollar) and consolidate railroad networks (the elimination of shorter less efficient lanes in favor of high-volume lanes).17 PSR may be the most widely accredited reason for the decrease in rail transportation employment. Before PSR was implemented the North American rail model which includes the United States and Canada focused on moving long trains with a single good in order to maximize capacity and yield the greatest efficiency. However this model was actually slowing down the rail network because trains would be late or canceled if they did not meet specific length requirements thus leaving customers unexpectedly without service. With the implementation of PSR the focus shifted to moving cars with mixed goods so that the trains are always moving and cars are picked up on schedule regardless of train length. Despite lower length requirements average train length increased because railroad companies were no longer discouraged from transporting multiple types of goods in a single train. As a result of PSR there is now more efficient timing and scheduling as well as an effective allocation of resources such as crews cars and locomotives in the places where they are needed on the rail network.18

North American railroads are divided by revenue into different classes. Class I railroads are the largest and have an annual operating revenue of at least $447621226 while Class II railroads are known as regional railroads and Class III railroads are known as short-line railroads.19 The practice of furloughing employees is rather common within the rail industry and usually depends on the volume of freight at a given point in time. After Class I railroads adopted PSR furloughs and layoffs in the industry increased. Rail companies including Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific have stated explicitly that they have furloughed or closed down certain operations because of PSR.20 Industry officials seem to hail the new efficiency PSR has brought to the railroads while union leaders have responded negatively because of its effect on employees. One article noted that reduced staffing is made possible by running longer trains as hitching two trains together allows one rail work crew to be cut. This coincides with a 25-percent increase in the average train length (1.4 miles) since 2008. In addition according to rail economist Jim Blaze seven major freight railroads idled nearly 30 percent of locomotives in 2019 alone as they aim to run fewer and longer trains.21

The North American Class I railroads that have adopted PSR as part of their operations include Canadian National Railway Canadian Pacific Railway Limited CSX Corporation Norfolk Southern Corporation Union Pacific Corporation and Kansas City Southern.22 The Surface Transportation Board (STB) regulates North American Class I railroads inside the United States and collects monthly data on employment and occupational composition. These data can be used to show changes in the occupational composition of some of the railroads that have implemented PSR while CES rail transportation employment data are not broken down by the specific type of job in which the workers perform. The STB breaks down the employment data into the following occupational classifications:

Executives officials and staff assistants

Professional and administrative

Maintenance of way and structures

Maintenance of equipment and stores

Transportation (other than train and engine)

Transportation (train and engine)

Thus the STB data show where in terms of types of jobs losses are occurring in the rail industry in a way that CES data do not. Chart 4 displays each of the STB’s occupational classifications and their employment since January 2018 showing little change from January 2018 to November 2018 as well as the changes in trend over the period from November 2018 to December 2020.23

The STB data show that the greatest job losses occurred in the occupational groups most directly involved with the actual operation and maintenance of trains on the railroads. Out of the 31000 jobs lost estimated by the STB transportation (train and engine) accounted for 46 percent of the losses from November 2018 to December 2020 despite representing less than 43 percent of all railroad jobs in November 2018. At the same time maintenance of equipment and stores jobs accounted for more than a quarter of the losses despite being less than a fifth of all employment in November 2018. In contrast the other classifications each contributed between 3 and 15 percent of the job losses over the same period. Although PSR appears to have altered the hiring and layoff decisions of rail establishments over the period employment in rail transportation began to flatten in the second half of 2020 indicating that railroads may have balanced out their employment levels with the new scheduling method.

Coronavirus delivers deeper losses

COVID-19 is discussed earlier in this article because the disease coincided and interacted with the other factors associated with the recent decline of employment in rail transportation. However the COVID-19 pandemic itself can be viewed as a fourth factor contributing to the decline of employment in rail transportation.

A national emergency regarding COVID-19 was declared on March 13 2020 as the virus began to rapidly spread throughout the United States. On March 15 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention discouraged gatherings of 50 or more people over the next 8 weeks prompting many business and school closures in a public health effort to slow the spread of the disease. By March 26 the United States led the world in confirmed coronavirus cases.24 As of April 20 over 316 million Americans in at least 42 states were being urged to stay home.25 COVID-19-related business closures during this period caused millions of Americans to lose their jobs and the rail transportation industry was no exception.26 Employment in rail transportation experienced two large monthly declines during the early months of the pandemic—April and May 2020—for a combined loss of 10000 jobs. This accounts for a quarter of the 40000 rail transportation jobs lost from November 2018 to December 2020 suggesting that the effects of the pandemic had a considerable impact on employment.

Chart 5 displays employment in rail transportation and the number of rail freight carloads over the period from January 2018 to December 2020.27 The two series moved similarly during April and May 2020 at the height of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and business closures. In fact both employment in rail transportation and rail freight carloads experienced notable contractions during those 2 months. However the two series have diverged since May 2020. After declining since January 2020 the number of rail freight carloads began to increase again in May which may be a result of the easing of state restrictions and businesses reopening in some capacity amid the pandemic. Despite the continuing spread of the virus every state had begun to at least partially reopen businesses by the end of May.28 From June to December employment in rail transportation began to level off while the volume of rail freight carloads continued to recover.

In addition news sources also recognized the negative effects of COVID-19 on railroads stating that the shelter-in-place mandates in April and May caused rail volume to be slashed. The COVID-19 pandemic had been predicted to result in a reduction in U.S. imports translating into less volume on the railroads.29 As a result Class I railroads had to deal with reduced demand by temporarily shutting down facilities with less rail traffic.30

In August a FreightWaves article stated that the STB and the Federal Railroad Administration who are responsible for enabling safe reliable and efficient movement of people and goods had asked the Class I railroads to resolve service issues that had arisen during the pandemic as a result of crew availability issues. At the same time labor unions questioned the railroads companies’ furlough practices stating that some recalled furloughed employees were being sidelined for a second time.31 This information suggests that railroads may have hired back workers earlier than they were needed which may explain the deceleration of rail transportation employment losses towards the end of 2020. However the pandemic is not over. New variants of COVID-19 could place further stress on the global economy and could make firms’ decisions regarding employment in the near future more uncertain.32

Summary

Rail transportation employment may be one of the smallest components of transportation and warehousing but recent job losses have been substantial with the industry losing 40000 jobs from November 2018 to December 2020. Rail industry experts and the public media speculate that the three main reasons for the job losses were the United States' decreased reliance on coal as a resource an uncertain trade environment and PSR—a new method of scheduling operations. The COVID-19 pandemic compounded these factors and affected rail transportation employment as a fourth factor. These factors suggest that some of these job losses may be permanent. Although we can acknowledge what led to the large declines in rail transportation employment over this period the future of the industry’s employment remains uncertain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvcmFkaW8vd3JpdGVyc2FuZGNvbXBhbnkvYnJhbmRvbi10YXlsb3Itb24taGlzLXNvdXRoZXJuLXVwYnJpbmdpbmctYmVpbmctYmxhY2staW4tdGhlLW1pZHdlc3QtYW5kLXRhbGtpbmctdHJ1dGhmdWxseS1hYm91dC1kZXByZXNzaW9uLTEuNjE5NjY2NNIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS42MTk2NjY0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brandon Taylor on his southern upbringing being Black in the Midwest and talking truthfully about depression,"Brandon Taylor was on a path to becoming a scientist before he burst onto the literary scene with his debut novel Real Life. Published in 2020 it received rave reviews and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize announcing the young American author as an exciting new voice.

Real Life draws on much of Taylor's own background from his upbringing in a Baptist community in rural Alabama to his graduate studies in biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin. It centres on a gay Black graduate student who experiences racism and a turbulent intimate relationship while struggling to escape a traumatic past.

Taylor's latest book is Filthy Animals a collection of short stories — about half of which are linked. Moving from the South to the American Midwest it explores the often unspoken nature of depression and the primal side of human behaviour.

Taylor spoke to Eleanor Wachtel from New York City.

Growing up in rural Alabama

""Maybe calling it a farm is too robust a word but we did grow our own vegetables. It was a little blue Jim Walter house which is a clapboard house on cinder block stilts. We had five or so fields. We would grow greens and beans and tomatoes and things. I grew up in this herd of other boy cousins. I had two very large families on both sides. My parents were neighbours and childhood friends. When they got married I became related to everybody in like a 10-mile radius of me. We would go into the gullies and the ditches and we would chase cows around much to the irritation of my relatives. It was a classic bucolic American childhood in some ways.

""But it was not always bucolic. I had an older brother and several older male cousins. They would leave me at home because I couldn't keep up with them. They would go and hide away in the clubhouses they built in the woods. Another kind of un-idyllic part of that childhood was that there was a lot of rural poverty in my family. There were a lot of struggles with addiction and money. People didn't have a lot and sometimes that translated into pain and aggression. It was a strange way to grow up for sure because you saw both the rural beauty of Alabama as a state but you also saw the privation and the difficulty of rural American poverty.""

Childhood ghost stories

""My grandpa would tell these stories about working on a dairy farm and the things that he had seen happen to other Black people. Sometimes the stories were about groups of white men driving in trucks and throwing and hurling things at people's houses. Or there would be stories about being followed by police officers down long dark country roads.

""But other times the stories would be kind of supernatural stories about people seeing ghosts or spirits or visitations in the night. As a child I couldn't always tell which of the stories were exaggerated and which were 100 per cent truth. So the result of that is that everything felt 100 per cent true all the time. Sometimes it could feel quite gothic. All of the grown-ups are laughing and I'm sitting there horrified at the thought of a ghost standing at the foot of my bed.

When I think about my earliest memories of stories that I wrote they're always about ghosts and dead children and the ghosts of dead children being locked inside of trees. - Brandon Taylor

""I think I started writing stories to amuse myself on those afternoons when my brother and my cousins would leave me behind. It started with drawing because my brother was a bit of an art prodigy. I was copying him as all younger siblings tend to do. But then everybody started telling me 'Oh your drawings aren't as good as your brothers.' Can you imagine saying that to a five-year-old? So I started trying to write the stories that were in my head — about superheroes and little boys who got lost in the woods and were chased by dogs and things.

""My dad recently told me that he found a box of old stories I had written when I was in third grade. He said 'There's one in that box that is about a little boy whose mother poisons him by feeding him Clorox.' He said that he remembered the teacher being very worried and calling the home asking 'Is everything all right?'

""When I think about my earliest memories of stories that I wrote they're always about ghosts and dead children and the ghosts of dead children being locked inside of trees.""

Writing Filthy Animals

""It always seems to me that when people act in a way that is most human that's when people call you animalistic. Like if you experience pain and you scream out in agony or if you're ravenous and you eat rapidly and with a lot of intensity or when you behave in ways that society doesn't want you to — that's when they call you an animal. They call you an animal to strip you of your dignity and to imply that you are going against the rules of decorum and that you should fall into line. I'm interested in those behaviours. Again and again I find that I'm writing about things that are hard to capture and to put into language and that very often is people behaving in ways that are thought of as animalistic or dangerous or brutal or primal.

""At least in the southern culture that I grew up with men weren't afforded a robust vocabulary with which to express their feelings or their inner states. I think people often think that manifests as 'Men are very taciturn and they don't know how to talk to other people.' But there's a part of that experience that gets overlooked: not only do you not have a robust vocabulary with which to talk to other people about your feelings you don't have one for yourself.

I remember being a young boy in Alabama and not knowing how to talk to myself about what I was feeling. - Brandon Taylor

""I remember being a young boy in Alabama and not knowing how to talk to myself about what I was feeling. All I had were these sensations and this intense feeling of pressure and no way to explicate it to others or myself. It made me miserable and you start lashing out. When people are like 'What's wrong with you?' You don't know what to say.

""I think that in the context of the title story in Filthy Animals what you have are four boys who feel quite intensely — who have these tender sensitive hearts — but who don't know how to communicate anything they're feeling except through their fists in these codes of violence and codes of machismo. That's what leads to some pretty dangerous scenarios for all characters involved.""

Being southern

""Being southern I associated it with being backwards in some way. I associated southernness with narrowness and with certain attitudes about masculinity and about life. One example is that growing up in Alabama most of the people I encountered were evangelical Christians. I was raised in an evangelical household. I was raised Baptist in a quite traditional and religious family.

""It seemed to me that to be southern was to be deeply religious and deeply conservative culturally and socially. All the things that I wanted in life — like a life of literature and a life of art and a life in which I could be an out queer person — all of those things were forbidden to me within a southern life. Of course now that I'm older I realize there are many different ways to be southern. These things are only true within a very narrow context and my very narrow upbringing.

It felt like quite an honour to be able to write a novel about a queer Black southerner and to have it be published and to have it recognized around the world. - Brandon Taylor

""But I wanted to get away from all of that. I wanted to get away from all these limitations things that felt like they were being imposed on me by the culture and by my family and by the society of the South.

""It's strange. When I moved to the Midwest I thought I would be revealed as a midwesterner at heart — that I was secretly a northerner all along. But what happened was that I realized how deeply southern I am. I realized that all these parts of how I acted and how I behaved were so southern. There was such goodness in that in being raised in the South and having a southern view on life.

""Now I think of it as being one of the great honours and privileges of my life to be a southerner to have had that kind of upbringing and to have that reservoir of experiences. It felt like quite an honour to be able to write a novel about a queer Black southerner and to have it be published and recognized around the world. And so I love being a southerner. It's great to be from the South.""

In Iredell County one of the lawmakers who helped changed the regulations was on hand as Rep. Timothy Moffitt was the first person to buy a bottle on Sunday. Pete Barger president of the Distillers Association of North Carolina and CEO of Southern Distilling Co. rung up Moffitt’s purchase.

“I very excited about that for something that’s not been allowed for 88 years to be one of the first ones to purchase that product is very exciting and I’m honored to be able to do that” Moffitt said a few minutes before he would make that historic purchase.

The sales come after the passage of House Bill 890 with one of the more notable changes in the bill being the Sunday sales of liquor starting at noon and going until 9 p.m. from North Carolina distilleries. The law however only applies to distilleries; local ABC stores will still be closed on Sundays.

For distilleries like Southern Distilling which previously could have been open on Sundays it makes more sense to be open now. Previously you could buy a drink on-site if a distillery was open but couldn’t take a bottle home. Now it can sell the product it makes to customers — not just drinks but the whole bottle. For Barger he appreciates seeing the evolutions of North Carolina’s laws since he began making bourbon in 2012.

“When we started this company in 2012 we didn’t have the ability to sell one bottle out of our front door” Barger said. He said it’s been an effort over the past decade to lobby for less stringent regulations but that the ability to sell on Sundays was as important as increasing the amount they were allowed to sell to customers walking in their doors.

Barger said it puts businesses like the distillery in Statesville on even footing with breweries wineries and other alcohol makers that take advantage of tourists on the search for local flavor in their drinks.

“It’s a huge deal for Statesville. We’re a huge magnet for tourism and we’ve pumped the brakes on that tourist business because you can only be open 50% of the time you needed to be open. It’s a real hindrance” Barger said. “You see we just built a new 12000-foot visitors center up here that’s going to be a draw not just to the people we bring here these are people that are going to be eating in Statesville restaurants sleeping in Statesville hotels filling up at Statesville gas stations we feel this is not just a big deal for us but for the greater community.”

Moffitt said the changes to the law which also included changes to sales at events and various smaller changes for manufacturers and sellers were done to “modernize” alcohol sales in the state.

“My goal was to modernize a very antiquated ABC system. Part of that is recognizing that our in-state distillers are treated differently from our in-state brewers cideries and wineries. I wanted to put them on more equal footing even though they sell a more controlled product I wanted to provide them the opportunity to compete in our state but also take advantage of the great tourism economy that we have and allow tourists that come to our great state purchase it on Sundays” Moffitt said.

For consumers like David and Heather Stanbro of Salisbury they said they see both why it’s big for Southern Distilling and a plus for them as well.

“For a small business perspective it’s huge” Heather said.

“It truly gets people out to the distilleries too to see how it is all processed and get that one-on-one connection with the distillery itself” David said."

There’s a unique airline attempting to gain market share on the highly competitive Austin to Dallas route. JSX is joining a long list of airlines adding new services to the growing tech hub Texas capital.

American Airlines currently flies to Dallas/Fort-Worth International Airport up to 11 times daily from Austin while Southwest Airlines offers seven flights to Dallas’s Love Field Airport every day. Together the two airlines offered 80000 seats between the two Texas cities last month onboard over 480 flights.

JSX is the third airline flying the competitive route with twice-daily flights to Dallas Love Field which began on Sept. 27. This will be the first time that Southwest faces direct competition between Love Field and Austin since 2016 when Virgin America briefly flew the route for six months. JSX offers a daily 10:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. departure from Austin and will fly about 1860 seats from Austin during its first month of operations.

JSX’s CEO Details Austin Expansion

Prior to the airline’s Austin launch AirlineGeeks spoke with JSX CEO Alex Wilcox to discuss the expansion and how the airline plans to compete among the two large competitors already flying the route. Wilcox co-founded JSX in 2016 and is a former founding executive at JetBlue.

“Business travelers more than anybody value their time and they are willing to pay to get more of it back. That’s the one thing that we provide that the big airlines can’t. That is the ability to get out of your car and onto the airplane within 20 minutes basically get on and go without breaking a sweat. If you try to do that on a major airline that airplane is long gone by the time you get to the gate” Wilcox said.

JSX is classified as a Part 135 carrier by the FAA so flights are operated as public air charters. As a result the airline is able to operate out of fixed base operators (FBOs) bypassing an airport’s main terminal.

“I think it is pretty clear that the Austin market is ripe for picking. There are a lot of people who are frustrated with getting through the commercial terminal there because of all the new capacity that has been dumped in the market and we are excited to offer a very convenient alternative at a fraction of the cost of what it would cost to get a private jet” Wilcox said.

Similar to Hawaiian Airlines which first landed in Austin this past April JSX is already seeing solid results from the perspective of bookings. Wilcox noted that Austin bookings are outperforming the airline’s initial expectations and the airline is satisfied with the fares that passengers are willing to pay for the short flight.

New flights to Austin come as JSX continues to grow its Texas base and flight schedule. The airline is also expanding on its existing flights between Love Field and Houston’s Hobby Airport growing to four daily flights. Looking ahead the airline plans to resume its seasonal flights to Destin Florida next year and continue its charter flights to Lajitas Texas from its Dallas base.

“We are looking at a couple other intra-Texas and a couple other markets that are not far from Texas as well. There will certainly be more markets and a broader operating region in the coming year” Wilcox said.

He did not specify any specific cities the airline is looking to expand into but the focus right now is to continue delivering on the promise to save customers time when they choose to fly JSX. Despite the evolving U.S. aviation landscape with competitors such as Avelo Airlines adding service from JSX’s Burbank Calif. hub the airline seems unbothered.

“JSX is focused on its customers we are focused on the things that our customers value and that is convenience reliability and a crowd-free travel environment. People that want those things will continue to fly on JSX and I think the rest of the industry can do whatever it wants to do whether it’s [ultra-low-cost carriers] or full service carriers. We don’t pay a whole lot of attention to that” Wilcox said.

Review: Flying JSX From Austin

JSX is the second airline in Austin to fly from an FBO joining Taos Air which first commenced flights in 2018. Prior to departure JSX sends multiple emails reminding passengers that flights do not operate from the main terminal. Upon arriving at the Signature FBO there is plenty of signage leading passengers to the JSX check-in counter. Within two minutes of being dropped off I had my boarding pass in hand and was ready for my 10:00 a.m. flight to Dallas.

Passengers who purchase a “Hop On” fare can check two bags each up to 50 lbs free of charge. The FBO had plenty of seating and a coffee machine as well. Within a few minutes of the aircraft arriving from Dallas boarding commenced. There were just 11 passengers on the flight to Dallas so we were all onboard and ready a few minutes ahead of schedule.

JSX uses its newer Embraer E-145 jets for all intra-Texas flights. These jets are a major upgrade from the Embraer E-135s used on many of the airline’s west coast routes. During the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic the airline decided to reconfigure its E-145 jets with an elegant 1-1 configuration maintaining a 30-seat cabin thanks to the longer length of the aircraft versus the E-135.

All seats on the right-hand side of the aircraft offer a large table and additional under-seat storage space. This is a convenient alternative to overhead bins which JSX has removed from its jets in an effort to offer a more open cabin.

The configuration is very spacious and I’d easily pay to fly with this seat on a longer route that JSX operates as well.

All seats onboard have access to power ports and offer 35 inches of legroom. For comparison full-service carriers typically offer 31-32 inches of legroom in the economy cabin.

Additionally each seat has individual A/C vents and reading lights.

By 10:01 a.m. our aircraft was taxiing to runway 18L for the short hop to Dallas. The inflight service was reduced due to turbulence but there were still multiple drink and snack options to choose from.

For such a short flight WiFi is not a huge priority for most passengers but the airline does operate longer flights where the option would be convenient. According to JSX WiFi will be arriving onboard its jets this year but the airline has not outlined any specifics at this time.

Additionally passengers can earn JetBlue TrueBlue points on all JSX flights. The airline offers 250 TrueBlue points for all flights where an “All In” fare was purchased and 150 points for flights purchased with a “Hop On” fare.

Following a brief 36-minute flight we touched down at Love Field and parked at the Signature FBO after a short taxi. All checked bags are unloaded and available airside for passengers to pick up as they deplane.

After a brief visit in Dallas I was back at the airport 30 minutes prior to the return flight. Just like the morning I had my boarding pass in hand and was ready for departure within minutes of arriving. This time the FBO was a bit crowded as there was a full flight to Las Vegas departing prior to the Austin flight.

A few minutes prior to boarding the airline announced a two-hour delay for the flight. While a reason was never given the JSX staff was very kind offered phone chargers for passengers and regularly updated passengers on the flight’s status. Similar to the Austin FBO there was also a complimentary coffee machine available and several vending machines.

The airline had a spare jet in Dallas so the delay ended up only lasting about an hour. An agent announced that it is the airline’s policy to purchase food for passengers if a delay lasts longer than 30 minutes. We ended up boarding our flight before the pizza arrived but multiple passengers used the convenience of the FBO to order UberEats while we waited.

Following the small delay 18 passengers boarded for the Austin return and we were on our way. Departing from runway 13L we enjoyed beautiful views of downtown Dallas as we climbed to 18000 feet.

Weather had improved from the morning and once we were airborne our flight attendant began taking drink orders. JSX offers an extensive menu for such a short flight with complimentary alcohol coffee and sodas. There is also a snack basket with savory and sweet snacks. For a 40-minute flight the service was beyond impressive thanks to our lovely flight attendant Felicia.

We flew parallel to I-35 the highway connecting Austin and Dallas for the majority of the flight flying over seven times faster than the cars below us.

Just over 40 minutes after departing we touched down in Austin after another pleasant flight.

JSX had been on my radar for a few years now and I was excited to see them entering the dynamic Austin market. I’ve only heard good things about the carrier and I went in with high expectations. They were met if not exceeded during my first two flights.

The fresh and unique approach to flying that JSX employs will appeal to many people flying point-to-point as the network continues to expand. It will be interesting to see new routes join the network as the airline’s Texas and broader expansion continues.

Apple

I had to.

I can't commemorate the launch of a new iPhone without visiting an Apple store and seeing how the company's renowned experts create excitement around it.

ZDNET Recommends The best iPhones You can find iPhone models directly from Apple starting from $449. Read now

Usually they're quite clever about this. They take their time. They listen. They even have a sense of humor.

Perhaps though iPhone 13 is unlucky for me.

I wafted to an Apple store on a sunny morning in the hope of being enthused inspired and even seduced into upgrading from my iPhone 12.

I was swiftly greeted and shown over to the iPhone 13 table.

Within seconds I was approached by a salesperson -- wait they're probably called specialists now -- and asked if I'd like some help.

Also: The iPhone 13 feels rough and unfinished

I explained I was interested in the new iPhone.

""Here they all are"" he said cheerily enough.

""Can you tell me why I should buy one?"" I asked. ""Right now I've got an iPhone 12.""

You're A Pro. I Can Tell.



""Those are the 13s over there"" he offered with a slightly dismissive air still allowing me to take a quick look. ""But you should be looking at the 13 Pro.""

Then instead of enthusing about the Pro's qualities from his own heart he chose to pick up one of the other phones scroll to the comparison page and begin to read. With all the enthusiasm of a vicar declaiming the benefits of salvation to an empty church.

He seemed most moved by the adaptive refresh rate that comes with ProMotion. At least his promotion of it was more alive than his monotone about the A15 chip being better than the A14 the battery life being better and the camera allowing me to suddenly come over all Hollywood.

""If you're into that kind of thing"" he said.

He insisted however that 5G was a wonderful thing that he enjoys all the time. Which doesn't seem to match most analyses of its current abilities.

I asked whether the phone would really maintain its speed over time.

""Well the thing is you think it's slowing down but it's just that other phones that come out after are faster"" he explained as if this is what I'd been missing.

I then tried a question that has plagued me in a very minor way.

""Why are the cameras on the back of the 13 now diagonal?"" I asked.

""It's purely aesthetic"" he replied with pure indifference.

Think Indifferent.



I still thought it was odd in a store that certainly wasn't crowded to not be witnessing the highly alert Apple-level enthusiasm that's so often exuded by store staff.

In the past even when I've openly said I owned the previous year's phone the salespeople have invariably presented the new phones and themselves with a relaxed abandon and an open encouragement to upgrade.

I could appreciate that the Pro has nicer shinier edges. Once you've enjoyed the matt qualities of the 12 for a year your superficial side -- large in my case -- yearns for change.

""So why did you change from your 12 Pro to your 13 Pro?"" I asked him as he'd offered that's what he'd done.

""Oh I'm on the annual upgrade program"" he replied.

""You can certainly sell me on that"" I thought.

But by this stage -- and this may have only been a four-minute chat so far -- he'd begun looking toward the door and then over my head toward the inner part of the store.

I imagined he had other customers waiting. I imagined he'd already decided that he couldn't/didn't really want to sell me on anything better.

Then the deeper truth.

""Look we get people coming in here with iPhone 6s 7s and 8s"" he said. ""They're the people who'll really want the 13.""

So yes it appears I'd been marked. Yet he could have very easily sold me with little effort on at least the upgrade program.

I was in a good mood that morning and I'm the sort of human who often doesn't get around to things until someone gently points me in the right direction.

But then he walked away.

""Feel free to play around"" he said already in motion.

Bye Then.



Did he walk toward another customer? He did not. He actually went to chat with one of his fellow salesmen who was standing somewhat emptily at another table.

Of the many many visits to phone stores I've perpetrated at least 95% have been extremely pleasant whether I've bought something or not.

At Apple stores it may have even been an even higher proportion. So this measured indifference was odd. It was almost along the lines of an AT&T store experience I had recently -- and quite the opposite of the T-Mobile one on the same day.

Perhaps I'd caught the wrong person at the wrong time and he wasn't pleased to see the phone in my pocket.

Perhaps he and his fellow salesman had more important things to chat about like another exciting San Francisco Giants game.

I decided that for now I could live without the 13 Pro.

I did however wander over to the new iPad Mini and that looked very nice."

Their website boasts that they are “making coffee the world’s first sustainable product to improve the lives of at least 1 million people in coffee communities around the world”. How does this pertain to global poverty? It is simple – of the world’s poorest countries many are also the top producers of coffee. Brazil Vietnam Colombia Indonesia and Ethiopia are the top 5 producers of coffee in the world. These 5 countries additionally experience some of the highest poverty rates in the world. Starbucks has undertaken the mission of giving back to those who laid the groundwork for what has made their business so successful for 50 years the coffee farmers.

Global Farmer Fund

With the goal of turning coffee into a sustainable product in 2008 Starbucks founded the Global Farmer Fund Program. Starbucks founded this program to aid coffee farmers in developing countries. Before the launch of the program Starbucks actually provided its first loan to a farming project in Mexico in the year 2000. This first loan allowed Starbucks to see the effect that such a program could have for farmers in need in developing countries. At the inception of the program Starbucks pledged to provide $20 million to coffee farmers in need. In 2015 Starbucks committed to providing an additional $30 million raising the Global Farmer Fund to a $50 million-valued program. According to Starbucks “By providing access to capital farmers have the ability to make strategic investments in their infrastructure offering the stability they need to manage ongoing complexities so that there is a future for them and the industry”.

Fairtrade International

In order to meet their sustainability goals Starbucks also partnered with Fairtrade International. Fairtrade International’s website boasts “We transfer wealth back to farmers and workers in developing countries who deserve a decent income and decent work. We are the leading independent global movement for trade justice and we are still the most recognized and trusted sustainable trading standard in many leading markets.” Fairtrade International makes sure that coffee farmers are getting paid fairly for their work and in return farmers adhere to environmental and labor standards set by the organization.

Fighting Poverty

The production of coffee plays a major role in the global economy particularly in regions that are home to many living below the poverty line. Sustainable coffee production allows for an ethical and lasting source of income that has the potential to not only lift many out of poverty but keep them above the poverty line for generations to come. With Starbucks supporting fair trade agreements they are protecting the integrity of their company at the root while also improving the lives of coffee farmers in developing countries. Support for companies that implement programs such as the Global Farmers Fund and acknowledgment of the impact they are making shows Starbucks is fighting global poverty with sustainable poverty reduction.

Every now and again we have to stop and remind ourselves that Starbucks’ full name is Starbucks Coffee Company since it’s not always a craving for a cup of coffee that brings us through their doors. Especially in Japan we’re as likely to be ordering a roasted sweet potato Frappuccino or sakura donut when we stop by the nominal coffeehouse chain.

On our last visit we mixed things up even more by skipping both coffee and sweets and instead ordering a special Starbucks Japan menu item that’s only offered at seven locations in Tokyo: beef lasagna.

We got ours at the Starbucks Reserve Roastery in Tokyo’s Ginza neighborhood and as you might expect from its rarity the beef lasagna isn’t exactly cheap costing 1012 yen (US$9.30). Thankfully the portion is sized as a meal not as a snack and 1000 yen or so isn’t a bad price for a cafe lunch in Japan provided the quality is there. The Starbucks lasagna also comes with three pieces of focaccia and as we know from our trip to their other Reserve Roastery in Naka-Meguro they know a thing or two about baking great bread.

At the Ginza branch the lasagna can be ordered on the second floor and we decided to ask the staff for a recommended drink pairing as well. To our surprise they suggested not coffee but Japanese tea specifically kabuse genmaicha a kind of roasted brown rice green tea so we added a pot for 770 yen.

We took our first bite of the piping hot lasagna and immediately any of our concerns about the price melted like the rich creamy mozzarella cheese. The oven-baked pasta dish’s bolognaise and bechamel white sauce combined to make everything extremely flavorful but without any unpleasant oiliness. It’s not just delicious by coffeehouse food standards either. We’d be extremely satisfied with lasagna this good in dedicated pasta restaurants.

Turning our attention to our green tea we were pleasantly surprised at how well the Western and Japanese flavors of our meal complemented each other. There’s a touch of saltiness that lingers at the end of the lasagna’s flavor profile but the genmaicha was a perfect palate cleanser with each sip’s clean finish having us ready for another bite of lasagna…or focaccia as the bread was excellent too.

▼ The staff even gave us a doggy bag so we could take our leftover bread home with us.

In addition to the Ginza Roastery Starbucks Japan’s beef lasagna is also available at its Reserve Roastery in the Nakameguro neighborhood and also the Ikejiri 2-chome Komazawa 1-chome Daizawa 1-chome Okusawa 2-chome and Daikanyama T-Site Starbucks Coffee branches.

But before I share this opinion first some words on Starbucks breakfast sandwiches.

Stop being such a snob.

I know the food isn't good. I didn't go there for the food. I'm there for the venti cold brew pumpkin cream coffees and maybe a Nitro if the machine's working. Obviously I dabble hot coffee as we make the transition into its regular season. Nobody is suggesting I am primarily interested in Starbucks breakfast sandwiches. But since I'm here and since I'm hungry I might as well get a little sammy to start the day. That's been a consistent attitude of mine since entering the corporate workforce nearly 10 years ago. I'm practically my generation's poster boy for the tireless advice that you save $2500 annually if you just kick that silly coffee habit that keeps you from throwing yourself in front of a bus every morning.

Anyways. The sandwiches. I eat them all the time. And as I said I recently awoke to a nondenominational epiphany that's worth sharing and it unfortunately has to do with the vaunted Bacon Gouda.

People routinely categorize the BG as the premier Starbucks breakfast sandwich and I've basically always agreed with them. The ciabatta is fluffy yet crisp. The egg patty blends nicely with the cheese. And traditionally speaking the bacon was flavorful and generously distributed. Again there's better places to get a breakfast sandwich but in the land of the blind the man with one eye and a bacon gouda is king.

Then something happened recently in my life. I ordered online pickup for my neighborhood Starbucks and they were out of BGs. Reeling in defeat of a night proving myself via Malort I needed something salty and fulfilling to offset my overactive stomach acids. Normal maybe. But certainly not healthy. And that's when the sausage started speaking to me.

You've been a bad boy Carl

And this bad boy needed breakfast. I pulled the trigger on the Sausage Egg & Cheddar then immediately went home and slathered it in JP Graziano mild muffuletta. From there I had rough sex with my SEC. It was delightful. The English muffin was perfectly toasted The sausage dripping with rich flavor. All components of cheese meat egg and bread perfectly ratio'd in a 1:1:1:1 formation once believed to be exclusively reserved for the Egg McMuffin. Not to mention this handheld is piping hot after some light travel in the bag. One of the more underrated aspects of an otherwise high performing breakfast food:

The cheese holds. Say what you want but that cheese holds.

Shortly thereafter and I'm a full convert. I don't want to hear your bullshit about how bacon is a superior breakfast meat or that english muffins are for poors. That's a trash attitude from a trash person.

In the dozen or so sausage egg & cheddars since I can say without hesitation that I made the right move. I encourage you to join on me on this journey. Put the Bacon Goudas away forever and ride with me into the future sunrises. I won't steer you wrong.

If the Eagles are in near mid-season form now it could be downright frightening what the squad accomplishes on the 3.1-mile course when it heads back to Wrentham for EMass and All-States.

Standout Nathan Lopez led a pack of seven runners through a 4:47 opening mile and gradually pulled away to an easy 15-minute 36.1-second victory to dominate the Red race. Teammate Charlie Tuttle was second in 15:57.0.

The Eagles averaged a time of 16:24 on the way to easily winning the team competition with 54 points to defeat Newton North (97 points) and third-place Lowell (109 points).

“The idea was to get on the course before the EMass meet because this was our only chance” said Lopez. “We put in about a 90-percent effort. It’s obviously not what we’d do in a bigger race. I wanted to get a feel for the course and put up a decent time. I stayed with the guys through the second mile and then I inserted a little faster pace. I kind of just held it from there.”

John Finn’s Catholic Memorial squad captured the team title in the Green race led by Chris Sullivan’s second-place finish in 15:56.4.

Aidain Ross of Uxbridge controlled the pace over the first mile and had a big lead over Sullivan by 2 miles which he passed in a fast 9:45. Ross a winner at last weekend’s Frank Kelley Invitational bolted home for the scalding 15:34 win the fastest time of the day. “I felt good the first two miles and after that it started hurting a little more” said Ross. “The course is just so hard over the last section. You hit the back section and know you have another half-mile of hills in front of you.”

Samantha Seabury of Wakefield was able to shake Bishop Feehan’s Lauren Augustyn and Anna Boyd near the 2.2-mile mark and charged through the teardrop section near the finish for a commanding 18:49.9 victory in the girls’ Red race.

Augustyn was also under 19 minutes (18:59.3) and Boyd clinched third (19:01.6) as Bishop Feehan took the team title with 37 points. Longmeadow was a distant second (111 points) and Newburyport copped third (118 points).

Seabury knew the time was right to make a move up a short hill when she sensed Augustyn was starting to tire. “I could hear her breathing hard so I picked it up on a small hill” said Seabury who improved her time over the course by nearly 2 minutes since last running on it two years ago. “The first mile was fast (5:51) but I was feeling very comfortable and I didn’t worry about it at that point.”

Whitinsville Christian’s Molly Lashley had the most lopsided victory of the day in capturing the girls’ Green race. Lashley stormed out to a 40-yard lead at the mile (5:28) and had more than tripled her lead by 2 miles (11:38). Lashley concentrated on her form and pace over the final mile for the win in 18:28.2. Sophie Jennings of Notre Dame of Hingham ran well to take second in 19:19.2 followed by Macey Shriner of Plymouth North in 19:21.4.

With 49 points Whitinsville Christian edged Milton (52) for the team championship.

Lashley said she needed to work over the last lap of the three-lap layout but was happy with the way she controlled the race. “It was tough” she said. “I felt strong. That last part was definitely a pusher. It’s a big PR for me since the last time I raced here so I’m really happy. My goal was to start out slower and I definitely paid for it the last two miles.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zaWxpdmUuY29tL2hpZ2hzY2hvb2xzcG9ydHMvMjAyMS8xMC9hbHVtbmktbWFydmVsLW92ZXItc3Qtam9zZXBoLWJ5LXRoZS1zZWFzLXN0YXRlLW9mLXRoZS1hcnQtc3R1ZGVudC1jZW50ZXItYXQtaG9tZWNvbWluZy1nYW1lLmh0bWzSAZ8BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2lsaXZlLmNvbS9oaWdoc2Nob29sc3BvcnRzLzIwMjEvMTAvYWx1bW5pLW1hcnZlbC1vdmVyLXN0LWpvc2VwaC1ieS10aGUtc2Vhcy1zdGF0ZS1vZi10aGUtYXJ0LXN0dWRlbnQtY2VudGVyLWF0LWhvbWVjb21pbmctZ2FtZS5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alumni marvel over St. Joseph-by-the-Sea’s state-of-the-art ‘student center’ at homecoming game,"The “oohs and aahs” echoing from the sidelines on the gridiron at St. Joseph-by-the-Sea HS on Friday may only have been surpassed by those of the passersby and returning alumni who marveled at the Huguenot campus’ revamped student center.

While the Vikings delivered a 27-14 triumph on homecoming night the school honored its alumni with a free-of-charge buffet in the student center’s state-of-the-art “skybox” -- an openly spaced room which doubles as the cheer and dance training area lined with fresh hardwood floors and enormous translucent glass window panes. Only alumni were permitted entrance as part of the event and were able to witness the game on a live stream from the skybox.

In addition to the skybox the student center also houses a fitness and weightlifting gym grand den which features a massive fireplace and on-site Nucci’s walk-up window professionally designed locker room as well as an on-campus Legends Sporting Goods store.

School principal Fr. Michael Reilly offered a grand tour of the multi-million dollar makeover to returning alumni who were astonished by the renovations and revamped facilities.

“Oh my goodness” said former Sea football player John Buscini class of 2018. “[This school] outdoes itself every single year with all these upgrades. I wish that we had this when I was here. I was one year too late...it’s outstanding work fantastic job.

“It feels like they’ve done 15 years of work in the three years [since I graduated]” added former teammate Robert Tarantola class of ‘18.

Approximately 100 alumni made their way in and out of the skybox during the course of the game -- frequently straying to and fro the field enjoying the action from both vantage points.

“It really is a treat to be a proud alum and watch the guys battle tooth and nail” said Buscini. “It really is nice. There’s something really special in this high school.

“I’m very jealous I didn’t have any of these things when I was here. It’s a privilege” added Tarantola.

BETTER THAN A COLLEGE CAMPUS

During the game a pig roast also took place and a live DJ was present. Students frequented the Legends store which featured a slew of personalized Vikings gear -- giving the campus a true “college feel.”

“The campus here is like a college atmosphere” said store owner and class of 1984 graduate John Lanza whose three children currently attend the school. “The students don’t realize how good they have it. This is better than a college campus.

“Father Reilly makes the atmosphere incredible here” he added. “We love it here. It’s an unbelievable experience. All three of my kids love it here. They get out of school at 2:30 and they stay on campus until 6. The majority of the kids stay.”

Fr. Reilly plans to make the skybox event an annual tradition for alumni at the school’s homecoming game each year.

“Just walking around and seeing the student center full of people eating laughing joking having a good time relaxing. That’s what makes me happy” concluded Fr. Reilly.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvb2Rnb29kZ29vZC5jby9hcnRpY2xlcy90aWxsaW5nLW5vcnRoLXN0LWxvdWlzLXBsYW50aW5nLWZvci1hLWhlYWx0aGllci1mdXR1cmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tilling North St. Louis Planting for a Healthier Future,"ST. LOUIS — Straw hat in hand Tyrean “Heru” Lewis jumped out of his pickup truck along busy Shackelford Road in north St. Louis County and walked into the tree line where he had something special to show.

On the other side uniform rows of vegetables — lettuce radishes and bok choy — sprouted on half an acre. The land is not on a remote country farm but in Florissant. As Lewis founder of Heru Urban Farming checks the crop he gets excited about its progress raising his voice over the sound of traffic.

He describes the need he has seen in St. Louis his hometown where many children don’t have enough healthy food to eat and the nearest fresh vegetable can be miles away.

He has also seen how gun violence has become a fact of life. As a health teacher he saw one of his students go to prison for a shooting. As a resident he often hears gunshots around his home. Three or four people are killed in his neighborhood every year.

“I mean that’s normal to some people and unfortunately to me” he said.

Researchers say a host of factors contribute to a city’s gun violence problem — deficits in social determinants of health such as income housing healthy living environments and quality education. And food security.

“I’ve seen the difference in kids when they get a meal and when they don’t get a meal how they behave and how they focus in school” said the 38-year-old Lewis. “So I truly believe that’s all connected.”

Nearly 70% of the approximately 270 homicides in the city last year occurred in low-income census tracts without access to a grocery store or supermarket for at least half a mile according to a Kansas City Star analysis of federal data and police reports.

St. Louis leads the state in gun violence and for most of the past decade ranked No. 1 for food insecurity according to the Missouri Foundation for Health.

But it’s not just an urban problem. Southeastern counties in or near Missouri’s Bootheel have high levels of food insecurity federal data show. And four of the 10 counties with the highest rates of gun deaths sit in the far southeastern corner of the state: Wayne Reynolds Pemiscot and Carter.

Food insecurity — the lack of reliable access to healthy food — across an entire community can lead to higher rates of health problems including mental health according to researchers.

Scarcity of fresh and healthy food in communities is a critical public health issue said Dr. Fredrick Echols director of the St. Louis Department of Health.

“It’s not just about interrupting acts of violence or preventing acts of violence but it’s really about creating change in the trajectory of the lives of the individuals that are considered high-risk in those communities” he said.

“Essential wraparound services — such as mental and behavioral health utility assistance mortgage and rental assistance and food — those are some of the things that a lot of people oftentimes take for granted and are really the key things that are necessary to change the environment for individuals.”

A few years ago Lewis decided he could be part of the solution.

“A lightbulb went off in my head” he said. “There’s a need here a demand here so why can’t I be the one that supplies it?”

Other urban farmers had the same idea.

A grassroots ecosystem of Black urban growers farmers markets entrepreneurs and community leaders has sprung up in St. Louis to increase production and access to affordable fresh produce in their communities.

They’re tilling and planting vacant lots backyards and school gardens. Their fresh produce is going to community-owned businesses and families in need. And they’re finding ways to fund and train the next generation of farmers and entrepreneurs from within their neighborhoods.

Freshman state Rep. Kimberly Ann Collins a Democrat whose district makes up the middle of north St. Louis introduced a bill to aid the efforts of urban farmers in her district.

The bill created a tax incentive and financial support for growers converting vacant lots into gardens. Recent St. Louis Land Redevelopment Authority data show about 96% of vacant lots for rent or sale are found in eight wards spanning the northern half of the city.

For Collins a resident of the Ville neighborhood the issue hits close to home.

“I have the highest rates of obesity diabetes right here in the city of St. Louis just because of where we live because we don’t have access to fresh food” Collins said.

“The convenience stores that are in our neighborhoods don’t have the apples and bananas; the convenience stores in our neighborhoods have all of the processed foods that you can get.”

The measure sailed unopposed through the Missouri House’s Agricultural Policy Committee a Republican-dominated body.

The choice to support the bill was not difficult said Rep. Don Rone a Portageville Republican and chairman of the committee.

“When you did the math on the size of the lots and everything there were over 400 acres of vacant lots in the city of St. Louis — not counting in Kansas City where they have vacant lots also” he said. “So this would enable those people in those neighborhoods to raise their own vegetables and have a source for fresh vegetables that they would normally not have. And it would absolutely improve the look of the city also — it’s basically a no-brainer.”

However the measure died on the last day of the regular legislative session when Senate Republicans refused to return to the floor to vote on remaining bills.

“We will get it across the finish line if the other end of the building does their job next year” Rone said.

But the growers at work in St. Louis aren’t waiting for the state to act.

Different food:

Farming wasn’t something Lewis planned to do.

For a decade he taught physical education in St. Louis schools until the trajectory of his life changed when he learned firsthand about the inequality in food access.

In 2017 he went to his nearest grocery store — a mile from his home — to buy the ingredients for a vegan meal. He didn’t find what he wanted.

“I wasn’t really happy with what I saw; there wasn’t a good variety to pick from” he said. The produce “actually looked kind of sickening.”

He traveled a little farther from his home to another location of the same grocery store chain. The quality and quantity of fresh produce was slightly better but not by much. So he drove even farther into the suburbs of west St. Louis County.

The farther from his home he went the better the quality of food.

“It was a shock” he said.

His solution? First he planted a garden in his backyard. Then Lewis quit his job and became a farmer.

From expanding his garden to vacant lots across the street to leasing larger plots on Shackelford and elsewhere Lewis expanded his operation to grow food full time.

Financing from grants has helped Lewis said. Last year he produced 200000 pounds of produce.

He expanded his business by selling subscriptions to customers who for $492 receive weekly deliveries from his farm during a three-month growing season.

About 20 customers have signed up so far he said.

For every five subscriptions he sells he donates one to a family in need. Everything he grows in his first garden by his home he gives away to people in his community.

His neighborhood Kingsway West which extends north of Martin Luther King Drive and Union Boulevard is considered food insecure by the U.S. Department of Agriculture because there’s no supermarket within a half-mile. Instead it is surrounded by corner stores and gas stations.

Many of the city’s food-insecure neighborhoods are north of Delmar Boulevard.

Delmar long seen as a boundary that cuts the city north and south along racial and economic lines is a key to understanding where food insecurity is concentrated said Jessica Meyers project director at the St. Louis Area Violence Prevention Commission.

“North of that we see areas that have had systematic disadvantages ...” she said. “Policies that have kind of gutted these neighborhoods including taking away access to healthy and nutritious food.”

What Lewis found in grocery stores in St. Louis also has been true in Kansas City a Kansas City Star report in 2018 found. Many stores east of Troost Avenue in Kansas City lack healthy food so residents often have to travel to more affluent areas in the western half of the city to find fresh produce.

‍

Helping Black farmers:

Anyone driving through the Walnut Park East neighborhood in St. Louis might miss the clearing at the intersection with rows of purple cabbage spinach and beets hidden by tall grass. But that’s where you can find Tosha Phonix almost every day in the spring and summer growing season.

Phonix signed on as a food justice organizer with the Missouri Coalition for the Environment in 2018 and soon saw the impact she could have.

Last year she left her job with the coalition to co-launch EVOLVE where her primary role is to raise grant dollars to help Black farmers in Missouri get financing and equipment they need.

“I realized that one there was no food justice movement here in St. Louis. And then two that Black farmers and growers weren’t getting the resources they needed to grow food for their communities” she said. “So I kind of took on the fight for you know resources and getting resources to Black farmers and growers in North City and throughout the Missouri region.”

The concentration of food inequity in certain communities does not happen by accident she said. Disinvestment in certain neighborhoods as well as the difficulty Black farmers have had getting the capital to start farming have exacerbated the situation in St. Louis Phonix said.

The disparities in food access have been called “food apartheid” a term coined by Black activists and farmers who reject the passive phrase “food desert” in describing the root causes that leave communities unable to obtain fresh healthy food.

Walnut Park East in northwest St. Louis where Phonix has her garden is a low food-access census tract where a significant number of residents don’t have a supermarket nearby. The corner stores and markets in the community are stocked with packaged and processed foods with the produce section often consisting of small bins limited variety and aging produce.

The neighborhood also has struggled with high rates of gun violence.

In 2020 the area reported 10 homicides according to St. Louis police data. Adjacent Walnut Park West tied another neighborhood in the city for the highest number of homicides last year at 15.

Gun violence in the neighborhoods has grown worse in recent years residents say and police data reflect their observations.

In 2015 Walnut Park East and Walnut Park West reported a combined seven homicides — meaning the neighborhoods have seen about a 257% increase in homicides over a five-year period.

‍

Community bond:

Southeast from Phonix’s garden is the Hyde Park neighborhood nestled against Interstate 70 where one of the only weekly farmers markets in north St. Louis launched in May.

What started as one urban farmer and a couple of vendors a month ago has grown to include multiple produce stands artisans a biweekly yoga class and stretching exercises on the lawn said Fatimah Muhammad founder and chair of the Hyde Park neighborhood association.

A retired businesswoman who moved from St. Louis County to north St. Louis to work in the community Muhammad launched the weekly market as a way for local growers to make a profit while providing fresh produce to the community at affordable prices.

For Muhammad the market also acts as a way to rebuild community bonds that have disintegrated over the years. Those bonds can deter crime and make the neighborhood safer.

On Saturday mornings every week since April and until October Fatimah Muhammad gets the music going sets out chairs and tables and greets vendors as they arrive for the Hyde Park Farmers & Artisan Market at the corner of Salisbury and North 21st Streets.

Muhammad says she wants to invest back into the community and the market is only part of her efforts. She plans to open a wellness cafe in the adjacent building where people can go to work eat and gather.

“I mean if you go back to childhood ... if I did something five blocks away by the time I got home my mother knew because the neighbors knew who I was and who my parents were” she said. “And so that communication is one of the biggest voids that we’re missing in urban communities.”

But the lack of access to affordable fresh healthy food is not isolated to a couple of neighborhoods in the city.

Of all the census tracts in St. Louis about half are considered food insecure without access to a supermarket or grocery store for at least half a mile.

Since it started six years ago the mobile Metro Market has become a staple in many St. Louis neighborhoods. Fully stocked with fresh fruit and vegetables and supplemented by items like Amish honey from Bowling Green in Pike County the bus is effectively a small community grocer on wheels.

It stops in areas without access to a grocery store or supermarket for miles said Quinton Ward executive director.

“With the lack of access you’re talking about this larger thing — you’re talking about systems that have not worked in a very long time” Ward said. “What is the walking distance between yourself and a grocery store? But then also there’s the affordability aspect — you can have multiple grocery stores around you but if you don’t have the resources to be able to buy those things it doesn’t matter because you’re priced out.”

The nonprofit’s staff regularly go in person to hand-select fruits and vegetables from wholesale providers making it possible to sell items at a reduced price. For example a bunch of kale is sold for about 50 cents.

‍

City state help:

For urban farms to prosper and make an impact in St. Louis they’ll need investment from city and state officials advocates said.

The state Legislature passed several bills related to food insecurity in the past session two of which were sponsored by Rep. Ian Mackey D-St. Louis.

One of his bills extended an effort that allowed recipients of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to use their benefits at participating farmers markets. Mackey said a pilot program was successful with close to $1 million used over three years.

Another bill established a Food Security Task Force a group with 22 members — academics food advocates representatives from faith-based institutions and food retailers — who will study the causes and impact of and solutions for food insecurity in the state.

Gov. Mike Parson has until Aug. 28 to sign or veto the legislation.

“We really want to connect the dots between our urban poverty and our rural poverty and try to figure out you know what other states are doing” Mackey said. “The states that border us even the red states don’t suffer with this quite to the extent that we do.”

Missouri follows Arkansas as the most food-insecure state in the region according to Feeding America’s 2019 data.

Tackling food insecurity can’t happen in a vacuum said Democratic U.S. Rep. Cori Bush whose district covers St. Louis and who has supported bills that deal with gun violence and food insecurity.

“In St. Louis we don’t have the luxury of dividing our social problems into neat categories such as food insecurity housing discrimination gun violence wage stagnation incarceration or climate destruction” she said. “Our communities are impacted by all of it and all of the issues feed into one another.”

A new feature called SharePlay also lets you watch shows and listen to music with others through FaceTime. While these are great upgrades they come more than a year after they would have been most useful during the pandemic and fail to add anything game-changing that will make FaceTime a true competitor for industry mammoth Zoom like better cross-platform options (and of course backgrounds).

More tapback options in iMessage

While iMessage did get several upgrades in iOS 15 including better sharing features we didn't see any new tapback options leaving us with the same message reactions we already have (heart thumbs up thumbs down ha ha exclamation point or question mark).

However it appears that his robotic persona was merely a facade put up during his time in New England.

Since arriving in Tampa Bay Brady has let his wit and humor out a bit more. He has been active on social media especially since joining Twitter before the 2019 NFL season and has appeared in plenty of commercials during his time with the Buccaneers.

Of course Brady was still a TV staple during his time with the Patriots. He didn't appear in quite as many ads as he does now but there are still a few memorable ones (though to be fair the present-day ones are just a bit better).

Here's a look at 10 of the most memorable commercials that Brady has been a part of during his career.

10. ""Deflategate"" — Foot Locker

Brady agreed to be in this Foot Locker ad in the aftermath of Deflategate. It wasn't exactly well-received considering his villain status across the NFL.

“I don’t exactly know what was going through my mind when I made the decision” Brady said of the commercial according to the San Francisco Chronicle. “I had a lot of free time on my hands at the beginning of the year. So I had to find ways to fill it.”

Choosing to do this probably wasn't the best idea but it was still funny enough to Patriots fans. To other NFL fan bases though it may have come off as a bit whiny.

9. ""Have an MVP Day"" — Daily MVP

There's nothing great about this save for the fact that Brady is dressed like a combination of Dwight Schrute and Joe Exotic. Enjoy the outfit but that's the only special thing about this ad. Perhaps that's why the company that made it has long since shut down.

8. ""Tom Brady's morning routine"" — Intel 360 replay

Yes Intel 360 replay can make Brady's normal morning routine look epic even though it's mundane. It's a bit similar to Brady's playing style as a quarterback — he's not the flashiest player; he just makes all the necessary throws needed to win — so perhaps there's some irony there.

This commercial is solid all-around but it's not quite as funny as some of the other comedic ones that top this list.

7. ""5 rings"" — Shields MRI

This was shown locally in the New England area but it's one of the better thought-out commercials that Brady was in.

Originally shot when Brady had four rings they shot an alternate ending with him putting five rings in the locker at the MRI facility. The original version with four rings was shown until the Patriots beat the Falcons in Super Bowl 51. After that they had the five rings version ready to go immediately. That's great planning on the part of Shields and Brady.

6. ""Retirement"" — Hulu

This was released during Super Bowl 54. Brady was just about to be a free agent for the first time so he decided to mess with Patriots fans.

Brady posted a still image in the week leading up to the Super Bowl. It sent New England into a frenzy.

Was Brady retiring? Did this mean he was walking out of a stadium and to another team? Or was he walking into a stadium to return to the Patriots? Fans and media personalities alike spent quite a lot of time breaking it down but it turned out to be a shameless plug for this Hulu ad which jokingly hinted at retirement.

The commercial itself was a classic straightforward one from Hulu but Brady deserves some props for how he handled the lead-up.

5. ""Bready"" — Subway

Look I get it. There's a lot in this that doesn't make sense. Brady doesn't eat much bread because of his restrictive TB12 diet so why did Subway choose him to be in this? Moreover why is Subway paying him to be in an ad for a product that he won't eat? At that level this commercial is nonsensical.

However the idea that Brady would wear bread-smelling cologne because he can't eat it is somewhat comical as is the mock cologne ad itself. And as Brady acknowledges he still has to recognize greatness when he sees it.

This isn't as good as the other Subway ads Brady is in but it's better than most realize.

4. ""Do Nothing"" – Uggs

Brady has long been an Uggs spokesperson so natural he was a big part of their ad campaigns. This one stands out as it includes Julian Edelman and Jeff Bridges.

In this ad campaign Brady is comfortable doing nothing while Edelman is desperate for him to do something because he's bored. This leads Edelman to try various things to grab Brady's attention including making a smoothie and popping bubble wrap.

Meanwhile Jeff Bridges comes over and sings a classic American folk song — ""Buffalo Gals"" — as Brady sleeps on the couch. He sings softly before playing louder and freaking Brady out.

Brady does well to largely deadpan in this ad series which can't be easy around the likes of Edelman. Of all of Brady's Uggs ads these short one-offs were the best.

3. ""Not enough time"" — Subway

Brady is a central character in this ad campaign. There are several commercials within it and he often appears as Steph Curry's rival. He steals lines from Curry in one while Curry complains about Brady not getting cut off as often as he does.

Of course Brady actually does. On a couple of occasions in the quick-hit ads Brady tries to get a word in is ignored and says ""But I'm Tom Brady!"" when cut off.

Brady's chemistry with Curry and the length of the short ads really makes this work.

2. ""I'm in"" — FTX (Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen)

Who would have thought a cryptocurrency ad would be this entertaining? FTX hit the nail on the head with this one. It starts with Bundchen convincing Brady to get into the cryptocurrency market and Brady deciding to tell all of his friends and acquaintances about it.

Of course this was made recently so most of Brady's friends are portrayed as New Englanders. He gets a variety of responses from them and is listed as ""the worst person ever"" in someone's phone.

Brady's New England friends also try to insist that they won't take him back but they immediately admit they're lying.

This ad is hilarious at its core and the reactions capture well the emotions that Patriots fans went through after Brady's departures. Throw in a couple of exaggerated Boston accents and a reference to Dogecoin and this is one of the best of the bunch for Brady.

1. ""Big game ad"" — T-Mobile (Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski)

This is easily the best commercial that Brady has ever made. It's probably one of the best recent ads featuring an NFL player.

Originally it was scheduled to air during the Super Bowl but given the NFL's exclusive rights agreement with Verizon T-Mobile released it online and on other networks. It was a hit right away.

The ad outlines the alternate history of how Brady landed in Tampa Bay. He called Gronkowski but Brady's ""spotty network"" led him to misunderstand Gronkowski's advice. Gronk wanted Brady to retire and join him in Florida. Instead Brady thinks Gronk wanted him to sign with the Buccaneers and recruits him to sign there as well.

Obviously that's not actually what happened but it's fun to imagine that it did. And Gronkowski saying ""I'm retired from retirement?"" and ""Mom where are my football pants?"" to end the minute-long spot is just icing on the cake. Well done T-Mobile."

An important relationship between equities and government bonds broke down during September and inflicted the largest losses for diversified investment portfolios since the pandemic market rout of last year.

Signs that inflationary pressure may become more entrenched have weighed on consumer and business sentiment. That helped prompt the first monthly loss in the S&P 500 since January. Treasury bond yields have risen as investors anticipate the US central bank may act to tame rising inflation pressure next year.

Losses in the two major asset classes resulted in a typical 60/40 portfolio containing US equities and government bonds falling 3.5 per cent in September. Not since a decline of 5 per cent in March of 2020 has the 60/40 mix suffered such a large loss according to FT calculations.

The combination of falling equity and bond prices during September “is a problem for all investors and not only asset managers” Seth Bernstein president and chief executive of AllianceBernstein told the Financial Times.

For the past four decades a 60/40 portfolio has provided investors with solid returns and lower levels of volatility. The strategy is a mainstay of retirement portfolios and older savers often shift the balance in favour of bonds for their fixed income.

The appeal of a 60/40 strategy rests with how a majority stake in equities provides exposure to growth through companies expanding their earnings. A smaller slice of high-quality bonds acts as a stabiliser in a portfolio and they have typically risen in value during times of market stress for equities.

During the decade from 2010 the 60/40 portfolio provided an annualised return of 10.2 per cent and provided investors with a gain of 15.3 per cent last year.

A period of prices for Treasury bonds and equities both falling together “ultimately depends on whether current inflationary pressures are a transitory or a persistent phenomenon” said BCA Research.

Bernstein warned investors should prepare for greater market volatility and faced much lower returns from owning a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds in the current decade.

“The 10-year yield can easily rise to 2 per cent” and “investors are entering a period of much greater volatility for bonds given the uncertainty over inflation and the small amount of income they now provide” said Bernstein.

While the 60/40 mix has gained 8 per cent in 2021 a challenge for investors owning a combination of equities and bonds is that both markets are richly priced limiting the scope of future gains.

“It is mathematically impossible to repeat the record of the 60/40 portfolio over past decades because rates are now so low” said David Giroux portfolio manager at T Rowe Price.

Vanguard last week updated its forecast of expected 60/40 returns for the coming decade and their capital markets model has a median annualised gain of 3.8 per cent through to 2031. The median annualised return over the next decade for the S&P 500 is estimated at 3.2 per cent.

“Our forecasts today tell us that investors shouldn’t expect the next decade to look like the last and they’ll need to plan strategically to overcome a low-return environment” wrote Joseph Davis chief economist at Vanguard.

That has prompted investors to explore owning alternative assets such as real estate and private credit in a balanced portfolio approach.

“I run a portfolio that competes with 60/40 strategies and it does not contain Treasuries and we also think most equities are not attractive” said Giroux. The T Rowe Capital Appreciation fund owns utilities that pay dividend yields of 3 per cent alongside leveraged loans and bank debt that are less volatile and should match the return of a riskier all-equity portfolio.

“In five years’ time I would not be surprised to see 4 per cent annual return for equities” said Giroux.

Bernstein said investors should hold fewer bonds and own more equities in their portfolios. While that approach means tolerating greater portfolio volatility having some bond exposure will help protection against a big drop in equities.

“Everyone thinks about diversifying but it comes back to owning fixed income or being in cash” he said. “Alternative assets and hedge funds don’t provide the scale [of diversification] to protect a portfolio for many investors.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hbmFseXplLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwL3Jpdmlhbi1hdXRvbW90aXZlLXN0b2NrLXJpc2t5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rivian Automotive Stock is One Risky EV Play,"Investing in what you know isn’t just about understanding the value proposition on offer.

The GTA 3 and Vice City reverse-engineering fan projects known as re3 and reVC were first hit by a DMCA takedown in February with Rockstar parent company Take-Two claiming copyright infringement.

The fan-created source code for both games was made available on GitHub offering a raft of eye-catching improvements over the original games officially available to play today on PC. (For more check out our feature on how re3 came to be.)

At the time project lead ""aap"" told Eurogamer he was worried filing a counterclaim might spark a lawsuit. However the team behind the projects ended up disputing Take-Two's takedown and without any sort of legal response from the publisher GitHub restored the reverse-engineered code.

In its counterclaim aap and co claimed fair use. ""We believe that any code in this repo that is similar to code or other content owned by Take-Two is either unprotected by copyright or is permitted under fair use"" read the counterclaim.

""We figured we have a good case for fair use on the grounds that we are improving and fixing the game as well as bringing it to new platforms"" aap told Eurogamer at the time.

""This was the reason for quite a few people to purchase the game from Take-Two to play it on their favourite platforms. So in fact we're only making them money and we figured it would be unwise of them to actually go after us.

""So we went the normal route: one of our team members filed a counterclaim with GitHub and after a waiting period of about 14 days the repo got reinstated.""

Before filing the counterclaim the project leaders talked to a legal expert who was working with GitHub but the threat of legal action remained. Perhaps inevitably Take-Two sued the project leaders in the state of California last month claiming they ""sought unlawfully to copy adapt and distribute to the public infringing source code for two classic GTA titles: Grand Theft Auto 3 and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City"".

Take-Two's lawsuit alleges the developers were ""well aware that they do not possess the right to copy adapt or distribute derivative GTA source code or the audiovisual elements of the Games and that doing so constitutes copyright infringement"".

The lawsuit also mentions the GitHub counterclaim alleging the project leaders ""knowingly filed bad faith counter notifications that materially misrepresented the legality of their content apparently claiming that because they allegedly 'reverse engineered' the Games' source code they somehow cannot be liable for copyright infringement"".

With the lawsuit ongoing Take-Two issued a second takedown notice to GitHub demanding the removal of the projects and GitHub has now complied posting the takedown notice from Take-Two's legal firm Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp. ""We very much appreciate GitHub's cooperation in this matter"" the letter reads.

A note on GitHub about the takedown.

Aap declined to comment when contacted by Eurogamer.

Behind the scenes it's clear Take-Two is ramping up takedowns against mods and unofficial ports of its older GTA titles. Many suspect this is because the publisher reportedly has plans to remaster GTA 3 Vice City and San Andreas itself and that it is seeking to quash competition ahead of release.

While billions of dollars in American aid poured into Jordan over the past decade a secret stream of money was flowing in the opposite direction as the country’s ruler King Abdullah II spent millions on extravagant homes in the United States.

Using an extensive network of offshore accounts that disguised his transactions Abdullah purchased lavish properties on both coasts with funds whose origin remains unclear according to a trove of financial documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and reviewed by The Washington Post.

Between 2014 and 2017 companies associated with the king spent nearly $70 million on three adjacent homes overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Southern California according to the files and other documents forming one of the largest bluff-top complexes in the celebrity enclave of Malibu.

At the center is a 14000-square-foot Mediterranean-style mansion that has seven bedrooms and nine baths and is outfitted with a gym theater outdoor spa and infinity swimming pool — all set on more than 3½ acres of prime coastal property.

The acquisition of these homes followed similar transactions in Washington D.C. where documents show that Abdullah spent nearly $10 million on luxury condominiums with expansive views of the Potomac River in Georgetown.

The purchases in the United States were part of an international buying spree. Abdullah also acquired at least three multimillion-dollar residences in London according to the files properties that he combined with a fourth he already owned to create a residential monolith near Buckingham Palace. This flagship holding added to a collection that already included two residences in the Kensington area and a country home near Windsor Castle.

Overall the king has spent more than $106 million on properties that are held by shell companies registered to him alone rather than to the royal family or the Kingdom of Jordan.

He made the majority of these acquisitions over a 10-year stretch that has been marked by mounting economic hardship in Jordan rising public frustration with suspected corruption surrounding the king and growing political instability that culminated this year in an alleged coup plot. The king’s half brother and 18 others were detained in a crackdown that exposed internal divisions that threaten Abdullah’s hold on power more than at any other time in his two-decade tenure.

“This comes at a very bad and awkward time for the king in the wake of an alleged coup plot that exposed deep concern in Jordan about corruption” said Bruce Riedel a former senior CIA official and expert on Jordan. “This will only reinforce those concerns.”

[Post reporters answer your questions about the Pandora Papers]

Abdullah’s spending may not be outlandish by the exorbitant standards of Middle Eastern monarchs. “You could probably pour all of his profligate purchases into one afternoon of MBS’s shopping bill” one former U.S. official said referring to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who once reportedly spent $450 million on a Leonardo da Vinci painting that he displayed on his yacht. The official was one of several who spoke on the condition of anonymity citing the sensitivity of U.S.-Jordanian relations.

But unlike the rich Persian Gulf monarchies Jordan is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East. It has no significant oil and gas reserves scant arable land an inadequate water supply and a single seaport too remote to be of much economic advantage.

Instead Jordan survives to a large extent on billions of dollars in aid that it receives for its role as a source of stability in a conflict-plagued region as well as for its willingness to accept millions of refugees from neighboring wars.

Jordan received $1.5 billion from the United States alone last year making it the third-largest recipient of American foreign assistance trailing only Israel and Afghanistan. U.S. officials said that this funding is tracked assiduously and they have seen no evidence that any money was diverted from its intended purpose.

A law office in London representing Abdullah acknowledged his ownership of foreign properties for personal use and vigorously defended his actions. “Any implication that there is something improper about [Abdullah’s] ownership of property through companies in offshore jurisdictions is categorically denied” the firm DLA Piper said in a letter responding to a request for comment from the ICIJ The Post and other partners.

Abdullah the letter said “has not at any point misused public monies or made any use whatsoever of the proceeds of aid or assistance intended for public use.”

The revelations in the financial documents raise questions about where Abdullah got the money and why a king who might argue that he is entitled to royal residences abroad appears to have gone to such lengths to conceal that they belong to him.

The documents show that Abdullah’s financial adviser contested even minimal disclosure requirements and that the law firm used to set up the king’s offshore accounts ignored if not violated international standards calling for special scrutiny of clients who hold positions of political influence.

article-outline View document

Even among themselves Abdullah’s offshore handlers seemed allergic to any mention of his name or title. On one spreadsheet listing several of his companies the king is referred to only as “you know who.”

DLA Piper said Abdullah’s use of offshore companies was necessary for security reasons. Abdullah and his family “are the subject of threats from terrorist and other destabilizing groups” the firm’s letter said. “It would be a clear threat to the security and privacy of [Abdullah] and his family if their ownership of particular properties were known.” The firm also cited a financial advantage noting that sellers might seek inflated prices if they became aware of the identity of “a high profile purchaser.”

Luxurious perch in Malibu

The documents revealing Abdullah’s purchases are part of a collection of more than 11.9 million records obtained from law firms accounting offices and trust administrators based in some of the world’s most secretive jurisdictions. The files dubbed the Pandora Papers were shared with The Post by the ICIJ.

The documents show that Abdullah 59 has spent years assembling a network of at least 36 front companies trusts and other entities with the help of accountants and lawyers in jurisdictions including Switzerland Panama and the British Virgin Islands.

Many of these entities remain a mystery with no clear indication in the files of why they were created or what they contain. Specific properties owned by the king were identified by searching for the front companies in publicly available real estate data and other records.

The king’s connection to this network of offshore companies is revealed in several key documents. Among them is a memo written by a compliance manager at Alemán Cordero Galindo & Lee a Panamanian law firm known as “Alcogal” where Abdullah appears to have been a client — through intermediaries — for years.

The Alcogal memo identifies one of its clients as “Abdullah al Hussein” with a 1962 birth date that matches the sovereign’s and an address “Raghadan Palace” that corresponds to his palace in Amman the Jordanian capital.

Elsewhere in the files are a copy of Abdullah’s passport and records linking him to wealth management firms in Switzerland — including Sansa S.A. and FidiGere S.A. — that worked with Alcogal to set up the companies used to hold Abdullah’s assets.

In some cases the names of the companies created for Abdullah appear to have religious or regional significance. Tigiris Investments Ltd. for example was likely named for the ancient river of Mesopotamia and Zayer Ltd. uses the term for tourists who visit Muslim holy sites.

Other names are oddly incongruous. Nabisco Holdings S.A. a shell company with no apparent connection to the global food brand was the firm used to make the purchase that gave the king his first and most luxurious perch in Malibu.

Satellite images and photos from property listings that predate Abdullah’s purchase show a winding driveway that arrives at a set of wooden doors behind massive columns. More recent images show that the property has undergone extensive renovations.

Inside floor-to-ceiling windows frame panoramic views of the Pacific between Point Dume and the Los Angeles coastline. There is a gym theater outdoor spa infinity pool and according to one listing an “industrial grade” data network and security system.

According to property records the house was built in 1999 and was first owned by a television producer Arthur Silver whose credits include the sitcoms “Laverne & Shirley” and “Married With Children.”

Abdullah’s Nabisco Holdings company bought the house in 2014 for $33.5 million according to public records a sum described in online real estate coverage at the time as the highest price ever paid for a property in the vicinity of Point Dume.

Next a compound

For Abdullah it was only the first piece in what became a multi-parcel compound. A year later documents show he bought a neighboring property for $12.25 million. Then in 2017 he purchased another for $23 million making him owner of the three connected parcels bordering a state park at Point Dume.

One of the added properties is a seven-bedroom mansion with a swimming pool and lush gardens overlooking the Pacific according to real estate listings. The other is a sprawling four-bedroom stucco home with a three-car garage floor-to-ceiling windows and a private patio at the edge of the bluff.

On paper the properties are owned by three separate companies: Nabisco Holdings Setara Ltd. and Timara Ltd. Public records provide no indication that these companies are related let alone connected to Abdullah. But all are listed on spreadsheets and other files in the Pandora trove that catalogue companies controlled by Abdullah.

Presented with a list of companies and properties associated with Abdullah DLA Piper the firm representing the monarch said the information is “inaccurate and out of date” but declined to elaborate or clarify. The firm cited its desire to “limit the risk to which our client and his family will be exposed” due to disclosures of the locations of properties.

To many in Malibu the ownership of the properties on Cliffside Drive has been a mystery. “If you figure it out you’re a genius” said Dan Sandel who has owned a home across the street for several decades. He said the purchases and subsequent construction at the sites have fueled speculation about movie stars and tech billionaires “any name in the world you can imagine.”

The properties are among the most coveted in the city exceeded only by a stretch known as “billionaires’ beach” where entertainment mogul David Geffen and others have owned structures right on the sand.

Jeff Jennings the chairman of the Malibu Planning Commission said that he was not aware the properties were owned by Abdullah but that aspects of renovation plans submitted to the commission in recent years had raised eyebrows.

A proposal for one of the properties called for the construction of so many bedrooms that Jennings grew concerned it was no longer a single-family residence. When he raised the matter with city staff he was told the rooms were for “the security detail of whoever lives next door” he recalled in an interview noting that speculation centered on “a Middle Eastern potentate.”

Abdullah is among a class of anonymous absentee owners who Jennings said have “changed the character of the city.” The homes are vacant for months at a time he said and their owners don’t shop at local stores send their children to local schools or interact with neighbors.

Cliffside Drive is a particular draw for those seeking privacy. “You have to look at the area we’re talking about” Jennings said. “Large homes on large lots fenced in with hedges you can’t see past.”

Abdullah has made only brief visits to the United States in recent years including a trip this year that included stops in Washington D.C. and Idaho. U.S. officials who know Abdullah said he is fond of the California coast.

The only known reference online to Abdullah and the Malibu properties is on the Facebook page of a Southern California company Bradford Sheet Metal that did renovation work at one of the houses. The 2019 post shows employees on scaffolding surrounding the structure with the caption: “The King of Jordan’s place in Malibu…My Guy’s [sic] doing what they do.”

When called by a Post reporter and asked about the Facebook entry a person identifying himself as the owner of Bradford Sheet Metal quickly hung up the phone.

An ‘unusually sensitive’ client

The Pandora Papers reveal the unusual extent to which the financial team went to protect Abdullah’s secrets.

In 2016 a financial adviser to Abdullah pressed to revise language in a “terms of business” memo with the Alcogal law firm to restrict when and to whom the king’s name would be disclosed according to documents. The changes were demanded by Andrew Evans a Switzerland-based adviser involved in managing the king’s money.

When a draft of the agreement indicated that the king’s name might under certain circumstances have to be shared with authorities in the British Virgin Islands Evans wrote in edits still visible on the draft: “Please would you define who is covered by the ‘authorities.’ ”

Evans demanded that records containing the names of his “unusually sensitive clients” not be stored on computer systems but only on paper. “Currently we only have one client who fits this category” he said in an apparent reference to Abdullah.

A year later in 2017 Abdullah’s financial handlers argued over how to interpret new financial transparency laws in the British Virgin Islands emails show. The laws enacted in the aftermath of the Panama Papers investigation required firms that register companies to provide BVI authorities with the names of the companies’ “ultimate beneficial owners” — that is the true owners behind the shells. The names would be held in a secure “portal” so that BVI officials could share the information with foreign law enforcement agencies pursuing investigations of fraud or other financial crimes.

Evans moved quickly to relocate his clients’ companies including those belonging to Abdullah to new corporate addresses in Panama documents show. Evans bristled when compliance officers at Alcogal asked him to furnish proof of who owned the companies even as they were being re-registered elsewhere.

“Please could you explain why you are requesting” this information Evans wrote back arguing that doing so undermined his efforts at ensuring secrecy. When Evans then proposed that Alcogal use his Swiss firm’s name rather than Abdullah’s the lawyers balked.

“I think we have a bigger problem” one of Alcogal’s compliance officers wrote to colleagues. Under BVI law the officer wrote the firm could still be compelled by BVI authorities to reveal true owners’ names for up to five years after their companies had been moved or dissolved.

It’s not clear from the documents how the matter was resolved. The files do raise questions about Alcogal’s compliance with international standards calling for additional due diligence when handling accounts of “politically exposed” persons. The standards are meant to bring additional scrutiny to the accounts of government officials or political figures whose offshore holdings might be an indicator of corruption.

Alcogal checked boxes on internal risk assessment forms declaring that its client — the king of Jordan — was not politically exposed.

Evans did not respond to requests for comment sent to him by email. Approached in Switzerland by journalists taking part in the Pandora project Evans said that he is now retired and confirmed that he had received the requests for comment but declined to answer questions.

Alcogal responded to questions from The Post the ICIJ and other partners with an eight-page letter defending its practices. The letter did not acknowledge or address the firm’s business relationship with Abdullah but disputed the allegation that “we have not classified certain individuals as PEPs where in fact we have.”

The letter said that the PEP designation “does not automatically disqualify a person from consideration to be a client” but that enhanced due diligence “is then conducted.”

“We are professional and law-abiding attorneys” the letter concluded a firm that has “never been indicted and much less convicted of any illicit activities.”

A well-curated public image

Abdullah regarded by many Muslims as a descendant of the prophet Muhammad is the leading member of a historic Hashemite clan that still administers key shrines in Jerusalem.

During his two decades in power he has cultivated the image of an affluent but altruistic public servant a sovereign who is a member of the global elite even as he steers a country dependent on massive influxes of aid.

The social media accounts of Abdullah and Queen Rania often show them dressed in designer outfits sitting astride one of his Harley-Davidson motorcycles or posing for pictures at the palace or in their seats on a private jet.

But they also appear visiting with villagers touring schools and hospitals and taking part in charity events. Their curated feed is a reflection of their effort to navigate the tensions in a country where roughly one-fifth of the population is unemployed and incomes have stagnated.

In 2018 protests erupted in Amman after Abdullah moved to raise taxes and impose price increases as part of austerity measures. Economists feared the country was heading toward insolvency — its ratio of debt to gross domestic product had surged from 60 to 93 percent between 2011 and 2015.

After days of protests marked by chants of “Bread freedom and social justice” Abdullah buckled suspending price increases and accepting the resignation of the country’s prime minister.

But U.S. officials and political observers in Jordan say public anger never fully abated and could be fanned anew by disclosures that Abdullah was spending millions overseas while imposing austerity measures at home.

“There are so many economic challenges and problems confronting the Jordanian people” said Labib Kamhawi a former professor of political science at Jordan University. “A normal Jordanian citizen is running a constant deficit in his budget and can hardly make ends meet” he said adding that revelations that Abdullah secretly purchased lavish homes would “fuel anger in the country and instability.”

A former senior U.S. official who served in Amman described Abdullah’s conduct as reckless. “It is shocking to be stockpiling residences abroad when you have fundamental issues of keeping your people afloat” the former official said.

The former official was one of several who said the disclosures raise questions about where Abdullah got the cash.

The United States has provided Jordan with more than $22 billion in assistance since the 1950s with aid surging to more than $1 billion annually in recent years. That money does not include $1.7 billion the United States has provided in aid to refugees in Jordan since the start of Syria’s civil war.

State Department documents indicate that the money given to Jordan has paid for roads schools and new water sources as well as the education of thousands of Jordanians at colleges and academies in the United States. At a more fundamental level the American largesse is aimed at ensuring that Jordan remains both an ally and a pillar of religious and political moderation in the otherwise volatile Middle East.

In recent decades Jordan has either stood with or directly supported the United States through wars in Iraq clandestine CIA operations against al-Qaeda and the Islamic State interventions in Syria and efforts to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Current and former U.S. officials expressed doubt that any substantial portion of American aid to Jordan had been diverted citing stringent reporting requirements as well as the potentially adverse consequences for Jordan if it were caught cheating its largest source of international support.

Jordan also receives hundreds of millions of dollars each year from countries in the Middle East including Kuwait the United Arab Emirates and at times Saudi Arabia.

U.S. officials and experts on Jordan said there is far less transparency about that gulf money. Abdullah appears to have wide latitude with the funding they said and uses much of it to reward prominent families for their loyalty and political support.

“Money from the gulf is almost never made public” said a former U.S. intelligence official who worked extensively with Jordan. “Some of that has been in checks made out to King Abdullah — not the Hashemite Kingdom.”

The letter from DLA Piper said Abdullah’s “personal wealth is not from public monies rather from personal sources.” Abdullah “cares deeply for Jordan and its people and acts with integrity and in the best interests of his country and its citizens at all times” the letter said. The firm said that under Jordanian law Abdullah pays no taxes but said that “a significant percentage of [Abdullah’s] personal wealth is used each year to fund projects designed to improve the livelihoods of all Jordanian citizens.”

Apartments acquired by Abdullah on Eaton Place in Belgravia London.

London and Washington

The Pandora Papers do not provide a rationale for the real estate purchases but Abdullah began moving aggressively to acquire assets outside the kingdom as rulers elsewhere in the region began toppling during the Arab Spring revolts.

In 2011 as those popular uprisings began Abdullah spent millions on a number of purchases in Belgravia an area near Buckingham Palace that is one of central London’s costliest real estate markets.

By the end of the year Abdullah had spent about $13 million to acquire a collection of apartments on a single corner of Eaton Place according to the documents. The total price he paid may have been higher because British records show that one property was transferred to an Abdullah front company by the sixth Duke of Westminster with no indication of how much money if any changed hands. The units appear from the outside to have been combined into a single residence with a kitchen and servants’ quarters in the rear.

Records show that each apartment was acquired by a separate shell company. And while the Georgian-style house is on a street where other nations’ flags fly to mark the presence of diplomatic missions there are no visible Jordanian markings at Abdullah’s address.

The complex is one of at least five Abdullah properties in Britain revealed by information in the Pandora Papers. Some of the purchases date from the early 2000s but none approach the amount spent at Eaton Place.

In 2012 Abdullah turned to the U.S. market spending $6.5 million on a riverfront condominium in Georgetown. The property included two units that had been combined to make a sprawling seven-bedroom seven-bath residence on an upper floor of a brick building overlooking the Potomac.

The apartment has floor-to-ceiling windows with sweeping views of the Potomac and the Key Bridge according to real estate listings. It came with access to a heated rooftop pool and sun deck. A real estate blog described that transaction as the priciest condominium purchase in Washington in December 2012.

Companies linked in the Pandora Papers to Abdullah then bought two additional apartments on the same floor over the next two years the first for $790000 and the second for $2.4 million records show.

Those transactions overlapped with the arrival of Abdullah’s elder son Crown Prince Hussein in Washington to begin studies at Georgetown University where he earned an undergraduate degree in international history in 2016. Abdullah’s two daughters also attended college in Washington in subsequent years.

From poverty to plenty

The wealth reflected in these secret transactions contrasts with the impoverished origins of Abdullah’s family.

“The Hashemites started out dirt poor” Riedel said and they emphasized that humble background throughout the 46-year reign of King Hussein Abdullah’s father.

“King Hussein’s mother sold his bicycle when he was growing up because they needed money” said Riedel who is the author of a book published last month about the history of the U.S.-Jordan relationship. “I’m not sure that Abdullah ever lived in poverty like his father but he was one generation removed.”

King Hussein came to own estates of his own outside Jordan including a residence near Windsor Castle in England and a compound on the Potomac River in Maryland that was later sold to Daniel Snyder owner of Washington’s professional football team according to property records.

But Hussein’s properties were largely treated as state residences where U.S. officials met with the monarch. At times Hussein used those assets to burnish his image as a public servant prominently selling one of his homes in England in the early 1990s to finance the restoration of the gold-plated Dome of the Rock shrine in Jerusalem.

After Hussein’s death in 1999 some properties and proceeds from sales of certain estates appear to have gone to Queen Noor his fourth wife according to public records and contemporaneous news reports.

That arrangement fed speculation in the kingdom about how much Abdullah — who is the son of Hussein’s second wife Princess Muna and who was designated heir only days before his father’s death — inherited when he ascended to the throne.

While criticism of Abdullah is rare in Jordan’s repressive political climate U.S. officials and experts on Middle East politics said he is widely seen as tolerant of if not complicit in corruption that has become an increasing source of resentment amid the nation’s economic downturn.

Coronavirus lockdowns suffocated an economy ordinarily buoyed by millions of tourists and public dissatisfaction with the government’s handling of the crisis formed a backdrop for the alleged coup plot this year. Among those detained was Abdullah’s half brother Prince Hamza bin Hussein the eldest son of King Hussein and Queen Noor.

In a widely circulated video he posted online during his detention Hamzah said that the well-being of ordinary Jordanians “has been put second by a ruling system [that] has decided that its personal interests that its financial interests that its corruption is more important than the lives and dignity and futures of the more than 10 million people that live here.”

Once the alleged threat to his reign had passed Abdullah turned to familiar gestures of reform. He announced the creation of a committee to study electoral changes that would give more power to Jordan’s people and launched yet another crackdown on corruption. In June the government announced a plan to replenish the kingdom’s coffers by hunting down assets hidden from the nation’s tax authorities in offshore accounts.

Even as these measures were being proposed the king’s contractors were pressing ahead with plans for major renovations on his own offshore properties. Last year one of his companies Setara Ltd. submitted documents to the Malibu Planning Commission proposing the teardown of the 3413-square-foot home he had bought in 2015 to build one more than twice that size in its place.

The commission not only approved the project next door to Abdullah’s centerpiece home on Point Dume but also recommended that it be exempt from coastal environmental regulations.

Antonio is one of the most prolific migrant smugglers on the U.S.-Mexico border.

MATAMOROS Mexico — The smuggler led a single-file line of migrants toward the border instructing them to hold hands. He filmed them as they moved almost silently through the brush as they waded across the Rio Grande as Border Patrol agents chased them down a dirt road.

Then he turned the camera on himself. Filling the screen with a wide toothy smile was the face of a teenage boy.

Antonio guided his first group of undocumented migrants into the United States when he was 12. He’s 17 now and one of the most prolific juvenile smugglers along a section of the border that’s full of them.

He’s notorious among the Border Patrol agents of Brownsville Tex. who keep a list of the 10 most successful juvenile smugglers on the wall of their office. Some have been caught more than a hundred times. Antonio always cautious is up to 15.

“He knew what he was doing” said one senior Border Patrol agent based in Brownsville. “His goal was to win.”

Since last October U.S. immigration agents have made more than 1.5 million migrant apprehensions along the country’s southern border the most in more than two decades. The Biden administration has pledged to dismantle the networks that transport migrants which are often described as sophisticated transnational syndicates.

But the smugglers at the heart of one of the world’s largest human migrations — including the current surge of children and families — are often children themselves.

They are boys who grew up on the southern banks of the Rio Grande. They earn about $100 for each migrant they get across. For many it’s a part-time job a hole in the border economy that they can fill. Some have become famous for their smuggling feats. They are the subjects of rap songs. Images of their exploits have been shared widely on social media.

Their success is made possible by a quirk in the U.S. immigration system. Antonio and the other juvenile smugglers mostly don’t have to worry about getting caught.

It’s a long-standing practice: The U.S. Justice Department doesn’t prosecute Mexican minors for smuggling migrants. When the boys are apprehended they’re put in white Border Patrol vans and expelled to northern Mexico where they are free to escort more migrants across the border — sometimes within hours.

That makes them valuable tools for the criminal groups that control the trade. A policy meant to protect the boys has instead made them targets for cartel recruitment.

“Niños de circuito” they’re called here: children of the circuit.

The work comes with an expiration date. When the boys turn 18 they’re no longer insulated from prosecution. If they’re caught ferrying migrants across the border as adults they can be sent to a U.S. prison for a decade.

That’s when the cartels steer them toward a new role. As the boys approach their 18th birthdays the groups recruit them for more dangerous work — as drug traffickers for example or hit men.

There have been months when Antonio smuggled migrants to Texas almost every day. He has memorized the curves in the Rio Grande: the way it narrows near Monsees Road the dense brush around Browne Park how you can cross the river by leaping between rocks at Las Rusias.

He can get over the border wall in less than a minute. He has learned to use Google Maps to navigate his way between Border Patrol checkpoints. On Facebook he changed his profession to “smuggler.”

“In the beginning it was like a game. You feel the adrenaline rush” he said. “You jump over the wall. You run away from the agents. You hide. And at the end of it all you get paid.”

Antonio turns 18 in February.

He sees two options.

There’s the first: He has already been pressured by the Gulf Cartel to move from “crossing people” as he calls it to a riskier role. Cartel members have loaned Antonio an assault rifle. They’ve asked him to start moving drugs.

And the second: The local government recognizing the number of local children drawn into smuggling has launched a program to extricate them from the business. It offers sessions with a psychologist a path to a high school diploma and jobs to replace part of their smuggling income.

The government has even created a soccer team for the kid smugglers their names printed on the back of the uniforms.

Soon Antonio will have to choose.

Recruited after class

Antonio was drawn into smuggling the same way as most of the boys in Matamoros.

He was walking home from sixth grade one afternoon wearing his school uniform and toting an oversized backpack when an older boy approached.

“He asked if I was interested in crossing people for money” he said. “I was innocent at the time. I didn’t even know what they were talking about.”

Antonio who spoke to The Washington Post on the condition that he would be identified only by his middle name out of concern for his safety was struggling in school. His mom was raising him alone in the city’s red-light district. He slept on a bare mattress in the kitchen under a poster of “The Last Supper.” Some months they couldn’t pay the bills. His father a veteran of the Mexican Marines was rarely around; when he did appear Antonio says he was brutally strict.

For as long as Antonio could remember migrants passed through Matamoros sometimes within sight of his apartment on their way to Texas. He often dreamed of joining them and leaving this city forever.

His first time guiding a group he was so nervous he could barely breathe. It was dark along the Rio Grande. He didn’t know how to swim. He managed to wade across the river and immediately got lost. Almost by chance he wandered into the white truck that was waiting to whisk them away.

“In the beginning I wasn’t that good” he said and laughed.

But within months the job started to feel easier. He learned to sweep away his footprints so he was harder to track. He memorized the locations of stash houses on the northern bank of the river. His bosses called or texted him when they had an assignment. Sometimes the messages were just two words: “Let’s go.”

He learned to dash back to Mexico if the Border Patrol arrived. He got cocky. He smoked a blunt of marijuana while crossing the river. He chronicled everything on Snapchat.

Sometimes he stayed for a few days in Texas. He hit the beach on South Padre Island. He met a girl with pretty brown eyes a U.S. citizen who was working on the Texas side of the smuggling operation.

He lost track of how much money he made. “It flew out of my hands” he said.

He bought a closet full of new Nike shoes. He bought a car. He bought Ziploc bags of methamphetamines. He gave his mother and his girlfriend gifts and piles of cash.

“He would disappear for weeks at a time” his mom said. “But when he came back he always had something for me.”

Antonio honed a pep talk for the migrants. Sometimes they were kids his own age from Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador. Sometimes they were adult men who looked at their guide in disbelief the final leg of their long journeys now in the hands of a child.

""They have the technology” he would tell the migrants channeling Al Pacino’s character in Scarface his favorite movie trying to sound commanding. “But we’re smarter we’re faster we’re stronger.”

Then he delivered his instructions for getting over the border wall: “Hold tight to the tubes and push your feet out to the sides and climb.”

The Border Patrol has grown used to catching the same boys over and over. Some like Antonio have become legends among the agents. One teenager in El Paso had a case file more than a foot long a senior Border Patrol agent recalled. When he turned 18 agents in the sector celebrated.

“It’s like any sport or anything. You have a kid that’s really good at what he does” said the agent in Brownsville who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was discussing minors. “Very careful with the way he comes across what he’s looking at. He knows when to move when not to move. He knows the correct route.”

Antonio became so confident in his skills as a smuggler — and so certain of his impunity — that he began to mock the agents.

“He was one of those kids who was like ‘Hey I got you three days ago’” the agent said. “It was kind of funny but annoying.”

Because the Justice Department chooses not to prosecute the boys the Border Patrol has few options. Sometimes the agency hires dentists to examine the boys’ teeth to assess whether they are in fact under 18 and not lying about their age.

[On the U.S.-Mexico border President Biden faces a political crisis. Migrants face a fight to survive.]

A few years ago agents tried to detain the kids for months without trial as a deterrent but the approach drew concern from human rights advocates and lawyers. Sometimes they return the boys to different border towns far from their homes controlled by rival drug cartels — another improvised deterrent that advocates say puts the children at risk.

But mostly the agents believe their only tool is persuasion.

“Kind of like a teacher you’re hoping when you talk to these kids and tell them ‘Hey man next time this can happen. You can end up drowning. Something bad can happen’” the agent said. “And you’re hoping that it sinks in for one of them.”

A revolving door

When Ivette Hernández Cavazos met Antonio he had just been caught by Border Patrol agents for the 11th time.

He swaggered into the shelter at the Center for Attention to Border Minors a square one-story building in Matamoros a few blocks south of the Rio Grande where the juvenile smugglers are deposited by Mexican immigration officers after being handed over by U.S. agents.

He was a skinny 15-year-old wearing an oversized T-shirt and a long gold chain. Tattoos lined his arm. He used slang to describe the migrants calling them chivos or goats.

But the facade crumbled quickly. He called his mother on the office telephone speaking meekly into the receiver. He asked if he could take a nap.

Hernández  a 35-year-old former Mexican immigration official had taken a job at the shelter a few weeks earlier. She was a petite woman born and raised less than a mile from the border with a curly ponytail. She typed Antonio’s name into a database and stared at the list of his apprehensions.

Almost every day she saw boys dropped off by Mexican authorities. Usually they were still wearing the clothes they had on when they crossed the river. Sometimes they lost their shoes in the mud; they returned in Border Patrol flip-flops.

“How many migrants did you cross this time?” she asked each boy. Then she waited for their parents to pick them up as if they had been suspended from school. Sometimes their mothers arrived in shiny new SUVs. Sometimes it was members of the cartel who came for the boys.

Almost always the teenagers would reappear days or weeks later and the cycle repeated itself.

Hernández watched as some of the boys became involved in more serious crimes. Some trafficked drugs. Some started carrying weapons. Some took supervisory roles directing newer younger smugglers. Local officials mostly watched without intervening as if observing a natural phenomenon.

“We weren’t offering them anything. It was a revolving door” Hernández said. “If we didn’t reach them organized crime would.”

Last year with a local government grant she started a program called “My Feet Above Our Roots” based at the center. She reserved a soccer field for the boys and recruited a coach with a degree in psychology.

To some of her colleagues it sounded absurd.

“They were like ‘You’re going to form a soccer team of child smugglers?’” she said.

It would be a way to keep tabs on the kids she explained so they didn’t spiral deeper into the cartel. Since 2015 government data shows at least 6714 Mexican minors have been killed in acts of violence as cartels have increasingly recruited juveniles. On the border careers in organized crime often begin with smuggling.

One study from the Autonomous University of Tamaulipas based on interviews with 107 human smugglers found that almost 80 percent knew colleagues who had been recruited by cartels to traffic arms or drugs or do other work like operating as hitmen or kidnappers.

The niños de circuito already had links to the cartel. In Matamoros it’s nearly impossible for smugglers or migrants to cross the border without paying the Gulf Cartel described by the Justice Department as “one of the most violent and brutal drug trafficking organizations in the world.”

Hernández thought about Antonio. Could she convince him?

“He’s the hardest one” she said.

On Facebook he had begun posting photos of the Santa Muerte the Saint of Death worshiped by many Mexican criminals. He made references to his allegiance to the Gulf Cartel. He posted a photo of the prescription drugs he had begun taking recreationally and another of himself holding an assault rifle.

By then the city was at the center of a surge in migration. March was the busiest month along the U.S.-Mexico border in almost two decades. More than 172000 migrants were taken into U.S. custody.

Antonio’s phone lit up with calls and Facebook messages.

“Do you want to cross some people?”

“I’ve got eight if you’re available.”

Even Antonio’s mother’s boyfriend who worked for years as a cook at a Macaroni Grill in North Carolina before being deported asked Antonio to get him across.

In March Hernández persuaded Antonio to show up at a counseling session at the shelter’s cafeteria.

He sat there his head resting on his hands as the other kids described their descent into smuggling the power they derived from it. When it was his turn to talk he wouldn’t say how many times he had crossed the river or how much he was paid — ordinarily his favorite subjects. He talked only about his mother.

“She doesn’t love me” he said. “I don’t have anyone.”

Hernández on the other side of the table counted Antonio’s new tattoos and thought about all the ways boys try to disguise themselves as men.

A few months later came the first soccer practice at a municipal park and there was Antonio. The boys’ names were printed on the back of their uniforms. Antonio wore number 10.

At practice the boys urged each other on. Run like you’re fleeing the Border Patrol they yelled. Jump like you’re scaling the wall.

But as the team got closer to their first game Antonio stopped showing up.

What happened? Hernández asked the other boys.

No one seemed to know.

‘I’m trying to find you’

So Hernández went looking for him. She borrowed her parents’ red Toyota and drove through the neighborhoods tucked behind the vast industrial corridor that had consumed Matamoros in the decades since NAFTA.

There was one of the world’s largest windshield wiper factories; a plant that made steering wheels; another that made gas masks. Jobs there pay a dollar an hour. If the kids weren’t smuggling migrants sometimes earning $1000 a day Hernández thought that’s where they would work.

The city had reorganized itself so that cartel violence mass migration and transnational commerce all coexist. Growing up in Matamoros often necessitates a familiarity with all three.

Each neighborhood seemed a little worse than the previous one until Hernández pulled up in front of Antonio’s cinder block apartment. The wire gate was locked.

“It looks abandoned” Hernández said. She peered through the wire gate. When Antonio didn’t answer the door she called his cellphone.

“I’m trying to find you. Where are you?” she said.

He directed her a few blocks away. When she pulled up Antonio leaned through the window of her car.

“What happened to you?” she asked exasperated. “They caught me” he said his eyes tearing up. “They arrested my girl.”

While the soccer team had been practicing he had gone back across the border. He met his girlfriend in Brownsville.

They had opened their own stash house and were splitting the rent. The operation seemed to be working. More than a dozen migrants at a time slept on the floor. Antonio was climbing the ladder of the smuggling business. He felt untouchable. He changed his profession on Facebook; now it said: “Works at United States Border Patrol.”

It was a strange kind of domestic bliss. Then one morning the door burst open. A whole team unit of uniformed men were suddenly in the living room shouting. They pointed guns at Antonio. Within seconds handcuffs were on his wrists.

His girlfriend 18 was arrested. Antonio being a minor was sent back to Mexico.

“My little skinny girl” he said to Hernández.

Hernández looked at him unsure of what to say. Before she could answer he pleaded:

“Listen I need help. I need money.”

Hernández looked around. A few feet away a man watched them a cellphone in his hand. She wondered if he was eavesdropping. Hernández was growing nervous.

“I’ll try” Hernández said. “I’ll try.”

Newest team in the league

A few days later came the first soccer game of the season.

It was raining hard. Nine boys had shown up. Antonio wasn’t among them.

Hernández on the sidelines in her raincoat kept a lookout for him.

Another boy Alexander began a short speech.

He knew Antonio too. They had smuggled migrants together. Alexander had pleaded with Antonio to stop — using his own life as an example.

(Sergio Flores for The Washington Post)

Alexander was 18 now. He had a 6-month-old son and a serious girlfriend. He had landed a job at the edge of the city as a car mechanic. He had gravitated to the program and the soccer team the way he once had to smuggling.

“These kind of activities motivate us to work for our own good and the good of our families” he told the small crowd.

The whistle blew.

The boys were playing against a team of women the Warriors many of them factory workers. It wasn’t until the women arrived that they learned that they would be playing against a team of child smugglers.

“Are you serious?” one asked.

For days the boys had traded jokes about how much stronger and faster they would be. But by halftime the boys were down 4 to 1. Their bravado had faded. Wet and shivering in the rain they looked once again like children.

“You need to focus” the boys’ coach told them.

Thirty minutes later it was over.

“We’ll get them next time” Alexander said.

Hernández got in her car to leave. She tallied her list of the boys who attended checking off their names.

She got to Antonio’s name and passed over it.

A kidnapping

A few days later Antonio appeared again. This time he was stumbling up to Alexander’s house covered in blood vomiting.

Antonio explained what happened. He had received a call from a man he had met as a smuggler who was now working more closely for the cartel. Would Antonio be willing to kill a man for cash?

He didn’t have to think about it. He was driven in a pickup truck nearly two hours to the farm town of San Fernando — territory of the Zetas a Gulf Cartel rival. One of his bosses told him the target.

He fired his gun he says but missed. His friend was shot in the shoulder. They retreated back to Matamoros.

Not long after he returned Gulf Cartel members broke into his mother’s apartment in the middle of the night and carried him out. His mother looked on horrified.

“They told me ‘You’re never going to see your son again’” she said. “I just stood here and cried.”

The cartel held Antonio for three days. They handcuffed him so tightly that the skin around his wrists was worn bare. They broke a table over his knee and punched him repeatedly in the face.

Was the cartel exacting revenge because the operation had failed? It was unclear. And to Antonio it didn’t really matter.

He pleaded with Alexander to let him stay at his house for just a few days.

But Alexander his baby son sleeping next to him worried about having someone in his house like Antonio and told him he couldn’t stay.

So Antonio went back to his mother’s house and collapsed on a mattress. Sorting through his options there was only one left that he could think of. He called Hernández.

“I need help” he said.

She told him she would visit and they would discuss his options.

But on the morning she was meant to drive to his house her boss at the shelter stopped her. It was too risky he said. She couldn’t be seen as meddling in the cartel’s affairs.

She called Antonio.

“I can’t come over” she said.

She didn’t want to say why: that he was now too dangerous for her to help.

He had made his choice."

“Think big!” the Fidinam Group says on its website. “We take care of everything else.”

One client who thought big – too big according to Italian prosecutors – was Massimo Bochicchio a financier who promised his investors hefty returns. All they had to do Bochicchio said was wire funds to the account of Kidman Asset Management which he claimed was affiliated with British banking giant HSBC.

But Kidman was a shell company in the British Virgin Islands a tax and secrecy haven and was not part of the British bank’s global network. Investors including Antonio Conte former manager of the Chelsea Football Club never saw their money again.

A leak of financial records provides new details of Fidinam’s connection to the scandal. Over a decade the firm which promises “personalized and discreet” care provided key business services to Kidman even holding power of attorney over a Kidman bank account through an offshore company the Swiss firm secretly controls.

Bochicchio used that bank account in a $600 million embezzlement scheme court filings say.

Fidinam’s ties to Bochicchio are revealed in the Pandora Papers a leak of more than 11.9 million files from offshore service providers. The records cast a rare light on Switzerland’s murky advisory industry showing ways that businesses like Fidinam have exploited gaps in the country’s regulatory system to help the rich and powerful hide money from tax authorities and courts.

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists received the documents and shared them with 150 media partners. The resulting globe-spanning investigation exposes the vast scope of the shadow economy that benefits the wealthy and well-connected including hundreds of politicians at the expense of ordinary people.

Propping up this economy is a sprawling industry of enablers from global law firms to trust companies to offshore specialists many operating within the United States and other Western countries like Switzerland.

The leaked documents include information on more than 90 Swiss advisers – legal notary and consulting firms – whose role in the offshore system is often obscured by more visible actors like banks and by a cloak of secrecy that enables them to operate with little accountability.

In Switzerland banks are required to conduct due diligence on clients to identify money laundering risks and to report suspicious financial activities to authorities. But advisers have no such requirements unless they manage their clients’ money. In 2020 advisers submitted a tiny fraction – barely 2% – of the more than 5300 suspicious activity reports filed in the country. Those reports are often the first step to identifying financial crimes.

A recent attempt by some Swiss lawmakers to impose stricter rules on advisers failed. Opponents successfully argued that existing laws were sufficient to combat money laundering.

The Pandora Papers undercut that claim.

From 2005 to 2016 at least 26 Swiss firms that appear in the documents provided services to clients whose offshore companies were later investigated by authorities looking for evidence of money laundering and other financial crimes. In most of the cases the firms played the role of introducer connecting clients to offshore service providers.

Fidinam at times was more than an introducer. The entities the firm controlled in Panama and the British Virgin Islands held shares in client companies facilitated loans between shell companies of different clients and oversaw clients’ bank accounts the records show.

Fidinam did so even after other financial firms raised red flags about its clients.

Bochicchio had opened an account for Kidman with HSBC where he once worked as an investment director. HSBC closed that account in 2017 after finding “irregularities” according to court filings. Soon after that two Fidinam employees working through the firm’s British Virgin Islands subsidiary helped Bochicchio open a Credit Suisse bank account.

Authorities say both accounts were used in the alleged fraud.

An HSBC spokesperson said that neither the bank nor its managers “had any ownership interest in Mr. Bochicchio’s investment schemes and never endorsed or promoted them.”

Credit Suisse later closed the account there because of “anomalies” Bochicchio’s former business partner told prosecutors. The bank declined to comment.

In May 2020 Italian prosecutors wiretapped Bochicchio’s phone and listened to his conversations with his wife clients and business partners. On one occasion he complained to a friend that some clients in Milan had called Fidinam as part of their “messy” attempts to get their money back according to investigative records obtained by L’Espresso ICIJ’s media partner in Italy.

The criminal case against Bochicchio is pending. A London court has seized his luxury homes and other assets. This year he told the court that he intends to return his clients’ money.

Bochicchio and his lawyers did not respond to ICIJ’s repeated requests for comment.

Fidinam declined to comment on its clients citing “privacy confidentiality and business secrecy duty.”

In a statement to ICIJ the firm which has branches in Lugano Zurich and Geneva said its “Swiss subsidiaries comply and have been complying diligently with the legal and regulatory provisions in force in Switzerland and with the applicable international regulations.”

Fidinam did not respond to questions about its offshore subsidiaries and their role in managing bank accounts for client companies including Kidman. The firm did not say whether it reported Bochicchio’s company to the authorities.

Stefan Lenz a former senior investigator with the Swiss attorney general’s office told ICIJ’s media partner Tamedia that Swiss advisers often play a key role in enabling financial crimes.

Past investigations have shown that “Swiss trust companies and lawyers set up the crucial offshore structures for money laundering with virtually no way to prosecute them” Lenz said. “The existing oversight of these actors is far too full of holes.”

The introducer

Fidinam is one of Switzerland’s oldest fiduciary firms providing tax real estate and business consulting services on three continents.

The firm’s founder Tito Tettamanti is a former semi-professional Swiss soccer player turned lawyer conservative politician and financier.

Tettamanti started the firm in 1960 shortly after he resigned from his post as a regional justice minister following allegations that he had reduced a real estate developer’s fine for tax evasion.

At 90 Tettamanti whose net worth is estimated at more than $900 million remains Fidinam’s honorary chairman. During a career that spans more than half a century he has built close relationships with heads of state and other politically powerful people.

Fidinam clients included Prince Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa the long-serving autocratic prime minister of Bahrain who died last year.

The leaked records show that the firm kept some clients on its roster while they were under criminal investigation.

One of Fidinam’s longtime clients Delfo Zorzi was under investigation for decades for his alleged involvement in two deadly terror attacks: a 1969 Milan bank bombing that killed 16 people and a 1974 bombing also in Italy that left eight people dead. He fled to Japan shortly after the second attack and became a successful fashion entrepreneur.

In 1997 prosecutors investigating the bank bombing wiretapped Zorzi’s Japanese phone and identified hundreds of calls he made to phones registered in Switzerland and used by key business partners in Italy including his “factotum” according to police records obtained by L’Espresso. In their secret conversations his partners referred to Zorzi with the code name “GM” for general manager.

Some of the phones Zorzi called were registered to one company with a Swiss address Vega Ltd. those records showed.

The Pandora Papers reveal that Vega was among six entities that Fidinam helped Zorzi and his business partners administer for his fashion enterprises. He also used one of those companies to buy property in Japan.

Zorzi was ultimately acquitted of all charges pertaining to the two bombings but he continued to draw the attention of law enforcement.

In 2012 Italian authorities determined that Zorzi used some of his companies to evade $80 million in taxes that his fashion businesses owed. Zorzi settled the case avoiding prosecution court records show.

Zorzi who now goes by the name Hagen Roi did not respond to ICIJ and partners’ requests for comment.

Fidinam did not comment on Zorzi.

The Panama connection

When seeking secretive tax havens for clients documents show Fidinam had what one provider called “preferred jurisdictions” among them Panama.

One Fidinam partner the records show was Alemán Cordero Galindo & Lee also known as Alcogal a Panamanian law firm and prominent offshore service provider. In his 2014 book “Honesty is Priceless” Jaime Alemán described how the firm helped establish the tax-avoidance and secrecy industry.

“The client simply went to Switzerland … opened a numbered bank account for which the beneficiary was a Panamanian corporation which in turn operated totally secretly and had no obligation to pay taxes in either Switzerland or Panama” Alemán wrote.

“The authorities in the client’s country had no idea these funds existed” he wrote “therefore they could not collect taxes on it.”

Since the early 2000s Fidinam has worked with Alcogal to create more than 7000 shell companies for its international clientele.

Fidinam repeatedly assured its Panamanian partner that it would take “all reasonable care to ensure that Money Laundering activities do not take place” records show.

Authorities have investigated at least 30 of their shared clients for alleged financial crimes.

In 2017 Panamanian regulators found that Fidinam and Alcogal had helped Paulo Roberto Costa a former executive at the Brazilian oil company Petrobras set up two shell companies that he used to take in more than $5 million in bribes. Costa became a target of Operation Car Wash a massive bribery investigation that ensnared Brazilian contractor Odebrecht and high-level government officials in a dozen Central and South American countries.

As part of a deal with prosecutors he pleaded guilty and served a year under house arrest.

Thirteen Fidinam clients with offshore companies were involved in Operation Car Wash leaked records show.

Fidinam and Alcogal also continued working with two brothers – Meyer and Nessim El Maleh – after they were convicted in Switzerland in 2013 of laundering an estimated $800 million.

Mossack Fonseca the law firm at the center of ICIJ’s Panama Papers investigation dropped the siblings as clients after their convictions.

But Fidinam continued to keep records and handle correspondence for their companies including one that was the target of the Swiss money laundering investigation. A French court in 2018 convicted the El Maleh brothers in a related case.

The El Malehs did not respond to ICIJ’s requests for comment.

Fidinam did not comment on the clients. In an emailed response to ICIJ the firm said that it cooperates with authorities in the event of investigations.

In a statement Alcogal said that it “duly complies with all laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates and it has always been our policy to fully cooperate with competent authorities upon their request.”

‘Nothing but hot air’

Most Swiss advisers have a lower public profile than Fidinam. The Pandora Papers show that even solo practitioners have become key facilitators for some of the world’s most powerful people.

Susanne Reinhardt who provides business support services from a village south of Zurich helped the children and allies of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev administer more than 30 shell companies. Some of those companies have secretly owned luxury property in the United Kingdom – holdings previously unknown.

Aliyev who has hidden part of his multimillion-dollar fortune offshore is an autocrat whose government is accused of torturing dissenters.

Reinhardt said she “didn’t care at all” about who these clients were and still today has “no idea” what their companies are used for. But “it was good money” she said in an interview with ICIJ partners.

The leaked documents offer a rare peek into how some Swiss providers reacted to earlier scrutiny of the offshore industry.

Jürg Wissmann is an attorney and a politician with the Christian Democratic People’s Party. In 2016 after ICIJ published the Panama Papers Wissmann sent emails to Alcogal and another offshore service provider demanding that they shield his clients’ identities and maintain paper records not digital files. According to an internal Alcogal memo Wissman would use WhatsApp for some confidential communications.

When asked to provide client tax information records show Wissmann refused and sent an angry email to Alcogal lawyers:

“​​You write about ‘advisors’ and about a ‘tremendous responsibility’ what I – being a professional lawyer working on international levels – consider as being nothing but hot air” he wrote.

Wissmann told ICIJ partner Tamedia that client information should remain confidential. “I was probably right to take precautionary measures” he said.

Wissmann’s clients the documents show included at least one company involved in the construction of a property known as Vladimir Putin’s palace. Putin’s critics allege that the $1.3 billion property by the Black Sea was built with bribes – an accusation the Russian president has denied.

Wissmann said he had “no clue” that the construction project was linked to Putin.

‘A pirates’ harbor’

Switzerland has been a hub of financial secrecy since at least the 1930s.

“Switzerland is a pirates’ harbor” said Mark Pieth a criminal law professor at the University of Basel in Switzerland. “You find everything you need to hide money.”

The global financial crisis of 2008 put Swiss secrecy in the spotlight. U.S. authorities found that UBS Switzerland’s largest bank had helped about 52000 Americans hide billions of untaxed assets in Swiss accounts. Under pressure from the U.S. and other countries Switzerland began reforming its banking sector requiring banks to verify the identity of company owners and flag suspicious transactions.

In 2016 ICIJ’s Panama Papers exposed the role that Swiss advisers played in the creation of offshore companies. In response the Financial Action Task Force an international anti-corruption watchdog recommended requiring lawyers notaries and accountants to follow the same rules as banks. The proposal was part of a broader effort to improve Switzerland’s anti-money-laundering regulations.

A bill to tighten those rules sparked immediate controversy. In September 2018 a group of Swiss lawyers consultants and lobbyists argued in letters to the finance minister that the proposed requirements were unnecessary and would undermine attorney-client privilege.

The proposal would “harm the whole wealth planning industry and is useless” wrote a spokesman for the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners a professional association that has about 1500 Swiss members including Fidinam executives.

Supporters of the legislation insisted that reform would boost Switzerland’s reputation. “The only ones who benefit from our legal loopholes are mafia clans dictators and other criminals who want to continue to use the Swiss business location for their criminal activities” said Florence Brenzikofer a member of the Swiss Parliament at a hearing last year.

Lawmakers spent more than two years debating the legislation.

In March the Swiss Parliament agreed to tighten parts of its anti-money-laundering law but rejected additional due diligence requirements for advisers.

The failure to include advisers was a “missed opportunity” to crack down on money laundering said Jason Sharman a University of Cambridge professor who studies tax havens and financial crimes.

“Enablers are rarely held accountable” he said.

I have a one month old S and have consistently found that the car ignores the scheduled charge time and starts charging on its own 10-60 min after being plugged in. Tesla has checked out my charger and the car and can find no problem. Today a tech recommended resetting my Tesla app password just to make sure some other app was not hijacking the schedule. I don't have any third party apps installed but I reset password anyway. Well about 30 seconds later I received an email from Optiwatt confirming that I had reset my Tesla password and could they have my credentials again. I declined.



As it turns out I had installed the Optiwatt app just to try it at the recommendation from a friend then decided I didn't need it and deleted it from my phone. I thought that was the end of Optiwatt but it wasn't. My car is now plugged in but NOT charging apparently waiting for the scheduled charge time tonight. It has now waited to charge for more than an hour--a new record!



I had never been to the Optiwatt website but I signed in with my previous app credentials and sure enough I have a profile with settings from when it was on my phone. The website shows charging at cheapest time enabled. Since I am on a constant rate plan I conjecture that Optiwatt was overriding the Tesla schedule to charge right away since I am always at the cheapest rate. Besides not sharing my Tesla app credentials with Optiwatt I have disabled Optiwatt's scheduling function.



Moral of the story for me: The easiest way to make sure only your Tesla app is controlling the car change your password! You will find out right away who else wants access.

Tesla delivered 241300 electric vehicles during the third quarter of 2021 the company reported Saturday. The quarter's deliveries topped expectations. Analysts predicted that Tesla would deliver around 220900 electric cars during this period according to estimates compiled by StreetAccount as of September 30. The company produced 237823 cars in the period ending September 30 2021 Tesla said in its report. Of that 228882 were its Model 3 and Y vehicles its more affordable mid-range offerings. The remainder produced amounted to 8941 of its Model S and X vehicles. Last quarter Tesla delivered 201250 vehicles and produced 206421 cars even as production of its Model S and X vehicles fell below 2500. ""Our delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct. Final numbers could vary by up to 0.5% or more"" the company said in a statement. Tesla does not break out delivery numbers by model nor does it report sales or production numbers from China versus the U.S. (Deliveries are the company's closest approximation of vehicle sales.)

Tesla put customers through repeated unexpected delivery delays during the quarter. In their release on Saturday the company acknowledged the delays blaming them on ""global supply chain and logistics challenges"" then thanked customers for their patience. The press release announcing the production and deliveries report was dated Austin Texas. Tesla's web site still lists its headquarters as being in Palo Alto Calif. but Elon Musk moved to Texas last year and the company is building a new factory in the Austin area. Tesla is also planning to host its annual shareholder meeting at its plant now under construction near Austin on October 7. Musk previously threatened to move Tesla's headquarters out of California in the spring of 2020 when the state's Covid-related health orders required Tesla's Fremont factory to temporarily suspend operations for a few weeks. At the time California Gov. Gavin Newsom told CNBC he was ""not worried about Elon leaving any time soon"" and voiced support for Tesla.

Elon Musk's electric vehicle maker now produces cars at its Shanghai plant and U.S. factory in Fremont California while continuing to produce batteries domestically with Panasonic at their sprawling facility outside of Reno Nevada. During the period ending September 30 2021 Tesla began to ship some lithium iron phosphate batteries from China to be used in Model 3 vehicles made for customers in the U.S. Tesla also temporarily suspended some operations at its vehicle assembly plant in Shanghai where it makes cars for customers in China and Europe. The halts were attributed to a global semiconductor shortage which has posed a challenge to Tesla all year and plagued the entire auto industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vdWx0aW1hdGVjbGFzc2ljcm9jay5jb20vdGVzbGEtaW50ZXJ2aWV3LTIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla at 40: 'It's Been a Bumpy Road',"Following a month-long battle with COVID which left him in a state where he could “hardly breathe” guitarist Frank Hannon was “fired up” to finally get back out on the road with Tesla.

The band is out on its current run without drummer Troy Lucketta who decided to “take a little time from the road to spend with family and friends” after 35 years of touring. In his place is Steve Brown brother of former Dokken skinsman “Wild” Mick Brown. The younger Brown is “saving the day” according to Hannon.

Currently celebrating their 40th anniversary the seasoned hard rock group continues to tour and record new music something which is unbelievable to the veteran guitarist. “When I was 18 years old writing that first album man I didn’t think about 40 years later” he tells UCR. “I had no idea that we’d be in the future the year 2021. I mean that sounded like a science fiction movie to me.”

Hannon shared some insights on “Cold Blue Steel” the newest single from the band as well as playing shows with Lynyrd Skynyrd and some vintage memories of touring with David Lee Roth.

Let’s talk about this new song “Cold Blue Steel.” It seems like it emerged as all good songs often do very organically. Can you walk us through that?

I’ve been producing young artists in my studio over the past year and a half. So my production and recording was up and running. Knowing that we were going on the road in a few months with Tesla I called [Tesla vocalist] Jeff [Keith] and I said “Hey man why don’t you come on over. Let’s write a song and record it. The studio is up and running and we can create something.”

He was fired up for it. We wanted to come out with something new for this tour. I was jamming in my garage on this heavy detuned [Jimi] Hendrix-y vibe thing. On the way over to my house he had been listening to some Lynyrd Skynyrd “Saturday Night Special.” He was cranking that up and fired up on it. Right about that time there had been some violence on the news and so I said “Why don’t we touch on the subject here.”

Now the way Tesla likes to be we’re very fair-minded. If you listen to the lyrics they’re similar to “Modern Day Cowboy” whereas we’re touching on a current subject. Like “USA/USSR foreign lands terrorist demands” but we’re not taking sides. “Cold Blue Steel” we touched on it the same way. The song is actually about people’s intentions.

The first verse says “Give ‘em an inch and they’ll take a mile/ Sick and unhappy behind a smile.” The song is about the evil intentions. It’s not about guns really. Even though it started off that way. “Cold Blue Steel” can be an airplane you fly into a building if you’re an evil person.

Watch The Video For Tesla's 'Cold Blue Steel

You talked about how the song starts inspirationally with Skynyrd. You’re doing some shows together. Do you know the Skynyrd folks?

We do know Lynyrd Skynyrd. We have a history with them. In the ‘90s when they did their reunion we toured with them on The Last Rebel tour [with] Gary [Rossington] and Leon [Wilkeson] was still around [as well as] Billy Powell. We’re great friends with Johnny Van Zant. We ran into them over in Paris. We did a festival with them last year.

But beyond that we just love their music. They’re the kind of band that writes songs like “Simple Man” and “Tuesday’s Gone” and “Free Bird.” Songs that are from the heart. They’re one of our biggest influences. When we wrote “Cold Blue Steel” we had no idea we were going to be doing dates with them.

It wasn’t until after that we got a phone call “Hey guess what you’re going to be opening for Skynyrd.” And we’re like “Hey guess what from our end we just wrote a song influenced by Lynyrd Skynyrd.” So it worked out.

What do you recall about first coming across the music of Lynyrd Skynyrd?

I recall being a 12 year old kid driving in a car and listening to FM radio. “Free Bird” was on the radio. Obviously the guitar solos are amazing at the end. Everyone knows how great that is. But the beginning of “Free Bird” when Gary Rossington plays that crying slide guitar really slow and emotional. I just remember being a kid and that sound just instantly touching me and making me feel a certain way that I hadn’t felt before.

Tesla recorded the most recent album 2019’s Shock out on the road with Def Leppard's Phil Collen producing. How did that experience influence how you’re making the songs that you’ve been working on more recently?

It was an eye-opener to realize that it can be done. You can record an album these days anywhere. You don’t have to go into an expensive studio and we used to have the mindset that we couldn’t write songs on the road because we were too busy doing soundchecks and all of that stuff. But the truth is you can actually get more inspiration on the road and you can actually do it if you manage your time right. What we’re going to do now is keep writing when the moment happens and keep it raw. [Tesla bassist] Brian Wheat and myself are going to set up a studio and do like we did with Shock but on our own this time.

I saw the band on the initial reunion tour in 2001. You guys have been able to add a lot of chapters to the Tesla story since then. It’s hard to believe it’s been 20 years.

It’s been a bumpy road. It’s not an easy road. The first half of it from ‘86 to ‘96 we frickin’ crammed and worked and never stopped and never took a break. Then it came to a head. We all got frustrated and the top blew off of it. We should have just taken a break. But we didn’t. We got mad at each other and got divorced and went through all kinds of legal bullshit.

If we had just taken a break it might have worked out differently. We did get back together and we had to change guitar players but [guitarist] Dave [Rude] has been with us now for over 15 years. What a solid guy man. The team is solid.

I talked to Dave. He’s a good solid dude as you say. It’s hard to find that kind of chemistry with a guitar player even once so the fact that you were able to find that magic again with Dave is pretty cool.

Thanks. It wasn’t easy bro. Before when we were going through the hardships again with our former guitar player I started shopping around for about a year. I auditioned a bunch of guys and I had one guy that was going to be in the spot. But he was a younger dude and he wanted to play in a band. He ended up going on to play in a band called Lit. He was more of a punk rocker and a killer guitar player named Ryan [Gillmor]. It didn’t work out with him so I was frantically searching and searching for a long time.

I had an audition night in Sacramento at a bar and I had eight guitar players jump up with me with my solo band Kaleidoscope. We were playing every guitar song you can imagine. Hendrix Rush Aerosmith Van Halen [and bands like that]. I had different guys coming up. In my back pocket I had Dave Rude coming up. I had found him on Myspace and I knew he was killer because he looked killer.

He sat in with me that night and I made a videotape of it and took it home and played it for my wife. We were both just going “That’s the guy right there. That’s him!” [Laughs] It was such a relief. He nailed the “What You Give” solo. Tommy Skeoch’s solo on “What You Give” is really hard to play with the feeling and Dave nails it. So he got the gig.

Final bit here. Do you have a good David Lee Roth story?

I do man. David Lee Roth was really great to us. But we never saw him. They had security so tight around him. Because he was the biggest thing since Elvis [Presley] at that time. I mean “Yankee Rose” and Eat ‘Em & Smile David Lee Roth was huge!

We would be in these towns like Buffalo New York or whatever in the middle of the day. He would go out jogging in the snow. I remember him walking into the venue with his bodyguard just covered in snow. He looked like The Abominable Snowman because he had been out there jogging.

Richard Duncan (Rick) Baird 71 died on September 16 2021 in Austin Texas. He had been in the hospital and nursing care for three months suffering from lung cancer and died peacefully in his sleep three days short of his 72nd birthday.

Born on September 19 1949 to the late Lewis Philip Baird and Mary (Privott) Baird in Dallas Texas Rick grew up in Dallas along with his older sister and two younger brothers. He graduated from Hillcrest High School in 1967. Shortly afterward he moved to Lubbock to attend college at Texas Tech University where he graduated in 1973. He maintained friendships he made while at Texas Tech throughout his life. In the late 70s and early 80s Rick worked for Texas Instruments first as an assembly line supervisor and later as a buyer. In 1977 he relocated to Austin Texas where he would live the rest of his life.

Rick never married or had children of his own but he was a generous and loving uncle (""Uncle Rick"") to his five nieces and nephews. Rick embodied a unique quirky and difficult-to-describe almost magical spirit of giving other-directedness and kindness. He loved for example to surprise family members or acquaintances for birthdays or other special occasions with silver dollars. His favorite time of the year was Christmas and he found joy in searching for presents for his family and friends all year round. All who knew him remarked on Rick's kindness and generosity. Every time you saw him Rick always asked in his humble way whether there was anything he could do for you.

Rick's spirit of generosity is perhaps best illustrated by the profession he chose in the second half of his life: delivering flowers. For over 30 years he worked at the Flower Bucket and later at King Florist delivering flowers and arrangements throughout the Austin Metro area. His calling in life was delivering messages of love and happy thoughts.

Rick is survived by his sister Sharon Baird brother George Randall (Randy) Baird and wife Karen McLinden brother Robert Trenton (Trent) Baird and wife Fran nephew Aaron Sloan and wife Lynn nephew Benjamin Baird nephew Maxwell Baird and wife Candice niece Emma Salisbury and husband Brad niece Madeline Baird and a host of long-time friends.

In this article we’ll take a look at the necessity of having power switches with accurate current sensing and see how modern switches implement this functionality.

ST says the new high-side switches are the first on the market to include digital current sensing as part of its all-digital on-chip diagnostic features. Image used courtesy of STMicroelectronics

Power Switches Require Protection Functions

High-side switches are commonly used in a wide variety of automotive and industrial applications. When delivering power to a load it is important to implement the required set of diagnostic and failure-prevention mechanisms.

For example one primary concern is a short circuit from the switch output to the system ground. If the wire harness that distributes the power accidentally contacts the car chassis the switch should shut off the output power immediately before damage is caused to the switch wire harness and the power supply.

To ensure robust protection against such fault conditions modern intelligent power switches include several different diagnostic and failure detection functions such as over-voltage under-voltage over-temperature over-load and short protection.

Accurate Current Sensing

In some applications we need to accurately measure the load current. For instance in an automotive seat heater the generated heat is determined by the current that flows through the switch. In order to precisely control the heat a closed-loop system must monitor the load current and make the required adjustments. High precision current sensing also enables torque control for motor control applications.

Accurate current sensing allows us to detect open load conditions when driving a bank of LEDs connected in parallel. A sufficiently accurate current sensing mechanism enables detecting the fault condition of one LED being open in a large bank of LEDs.

Analog Current Sensing

Most intelligent power switches with current sensing capability provide an analog signal proportional to the load current. The following figure shows the analog current sensing mechanism of the TPS1H100-Q1 from Texas Instruments.

A TPSxHxxx current sense circuit. Image used courtesy of Texas Instruments

In this case a current mirror topology is used to create a current proportional to the output current I OUT  in the “Sense MOSFET” branch. This copied current is delivered to the sense resistor R SNS  through the SNS pin. Therefore the voltage across the sense resistor is proportional to the load current.

The RC low-pass filter between the SNS pin and the ADC input removes the unwanted high-frequency components of the sense resistor voltage. The filtered output is then delivered to the A/D converter of the MCU that controls the power switch. The ratio of the output current to the sense current I SNS  is given in the device datasheet and hence the MCU can easily determine the load current.

Digital Current Sensing

STMicroelectronics has recently introduced the VN9D30Q100F and VN9D5D20FN high-side drivers that can output the digital value of the load current. The functional block diagram of the VN9D30Q100F is shown below.





Block diagram of the VN9D30Q100F. Image used courtesy of STMicroelectronics

As you can see the device uses an internal ADC to digitize the output current value. The incorporated ADC is a 10-bit SAR A/D converter. Since the VN9D30Q100F has six different channels an analog multiplexer is used to connect the channel being monitored to the amplifier and ADC block.

An SPI interface is used to send the digitized information to the MCU. Integrating the ADC into the switch package enables resource-saving on the MCU side and reduces the number of external components. In this way the new device can reduce the MCU workload as well as I/O usage.

STMicroelectronics claims that the new devices are the first intelligent power switches on the market that offer digital current sensing. As shown in the above block diagram the ADC can also digitize the temperature information read by the internal sensor.

Current Sense Accuracy

It should be noted that at lower load currents the accuracy of the current sense circuitry can reduce significantly for both analog and digital current sensing methods. For example with the TPS1H100-Q1 from TI the accuracy of current sensing for \[I_{OUT} \geq 1A\] is ±3%; however for an I OUT of about 5 mA the reported accuracy is ±80%.

The following figure shows the general trend of losing accuracy at lower output currents.

A similar trend is also observed with the digital current sensing mechanism employed in the recently announced ST products. The table below shows how the accuracy of the VN9D30Q100F is reduced at lower output currents.

Other Features

The VN9D30Q100F and VN9D5D20FN are designed for applications powered by a 12 V battery.

On Tuesday Aug. 15 2017 the Commerce Department releases retail sales data for July. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)

TAMPA Fla. (WFLA) — Decorating and design enthusiasts can now get all the off-price goodness of a HomeGoods run without leaving their house.

With so many other companies focused on making it easier and faster to buy things online HomeGoods and other TJX stores Ross and Burlington have been known for doing the opposite – ditching e-commerce for a “treasure hunt”-style experience.

Now the retailer hopes that an online presence will only grow the company further with the launch of HomeGoods.com.

“We are excited to expand HomeGoods’ digital footprint so customers can shop whenever they’d like” said TJX Digital US President Mark DeOliveira in a press release. “HomeGoods.com will provide a complementary experience to our stores allowing shoppers to pair in-store purchases with online finds to bring their vision to life” DeOliveira said.

What remains to be seen however is if customers in 2021 will generously embrace the shipping policy which is a good bit pricier than people are used to with Amazon Prime.

HomeGoods.com is offering free shipping but only if you spend $119 or more. Failing to hit that threshold will result in a $14.99 shipping charge.

HomeGoods says shoppers can return eligible items for free at any one of the more than 820 HomeGoods locations across the U.S. or return by mail for a $14.99 fee.

The store said it plans to continue to expand its online merchandise after the initial launch.",,,,,,

Tractor Supply which bills itself as “a rural lifestyle retailer” offers a wide range of products such as animal feed pet food and supplies propane fencing garden supplies and home supplies.

The store at 126 Charles St. is in the former Shopko which closed in June 2019.

Ron Hayes president of the Oconto Area Chamber of Commerce said the opening of the store fills a vacant storefront and demonstrates the growth of the community.

“This sends a good message that Oconto is really thriving now” he said.

The store also offers merchandise that either hadn’t been available or only was available on a limited basis since Shopko closed Hayes noted including clothing and campground equipment.

A spokesperson for Tractor Supply said the store will hire about 15 people with at least half of the jobs being full-time positions. Anyone interested in applying can visit TractorSupply.com/careers.

The former Shopko was suggested to the company in late February and a deal was formalized about a month later company officials said previously.

The building was sold in May for $550000 according to online Department of Revenue records.

Oconto Tractor Supply is open from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sunday.

The company says it’s taken numerous steps to protect customers and employees during the coronavirus pandemic including adding a dedicated greeter at every store location to drive awareness of social distancing monitoring the number of customers in its stores investing in mobile point of sale and contactless payment options offering contactless curbside delivery and increasing daily cleaning.

Also the hour from 8 to 9 a.m. on Wednesdays is set aside for high-risk customers and seniors 60 and older.

As of June 26 the Brentwood Tenn.-based retailer operated 1955 stores with more than 45000 employees in 49 states. By the end of October the company will have 29 stores in Wisconsin. The nearest stores to Oconto are in Marinette and Shawano.

Tractor Supply reached $10.6 billion in sales in 2020 an increase of more than 27% for all stores and 23% for same store sales.

The 81-year-old company which opened its 1000th store in 2011 has moved steadily up on the Fortune 500 list of the nation’s largest companies since first being listed in 2014. It was ranked 291st this year.

Happy National 4-H Week! This year Oct. 3-9 is officially National 4-H Week when 4-H is celebrated and promoted all across the United States.

With nearly 6 million members across the United States 4-H is the nation’s largest youth development organization and youth in Rowan County are reaping the benefits.

4-H began in 1902 as a way for rural youth to learn about leadership skills and agricultural technologies through hands-on learning. Today 4-H the youth development sector of Cooperative Extension continues to focus on practical hands-on youth development opportunities but it is no longer limited to rural youth. 4-H is found in rural urban and suburban communities. Agricultural learning still happens in 4-H but it is not limited to that. 4-H’ers today can also learn about cooking nutrition rocketry robotics environmental protection computer science photography public speaking service and more. We have six 4-H clubs in the county that youth can become involved in to help them expand their knowledge and skills. We are always looking for adult volunteers to lead programs too.

Rowan County 4-H is available for ages 5-18 (as of their birthday on Jan. 1 of that year) and includes speaking skills practice with record keeping learning how to properly use parliamentary procedure salesmanship skills during fundraisers participation in competitive events awards good sportsmanship learning to help others lifelong friendships travel fun networking opportunities scholarship opportunities leadership skills and more. Plus 4-H experiences look great on scholarship college and job applications.

Several upcoming opportunities are available including a pumpkin decorating contest this month and an electric workshop in November. In December we will host a holiday bake-off. Registration will all be in 4-HOnline. If your children aren’t already enrolled in this system you can enroll them for free at v2.4honline.com. You can also contact me to be added to our monthly email newsletter.

I am currently seeking out those interested in sending 8-14-year-olds to overnight camp for summer 2022. We don’t have camp dates yet but I will soon have to request spots for this summer. For more information go to go.ncsu.edu/2022rowan4hcampinterest. A parent whose child attended 4-H Camp last summer recently told me that “as a parent Betsy-Jeff Penn 4-H camp was everything I could want for my child’s summer experience.”

You can also donate during Tractor Supply’s Paper Clover Week Oct. 6-17. Donate to 4-H at the register and 90% of the donations collected at the Salisbury store go to Rowan County 4-H. The remaining 10% goes to 4-H at the state and national levels.

The 4-H Fall Plant Sale is going on now through Oct. 28. All profits go to support the county 4-H program. Call our office or visit https://rowan.ces.ncsu.edu/2021/09/fall-2021-rowan-4-h-plant-sale-order-now/.

To keep greenery fresh for as long as possible make sure to soak it overnight (greenery side down) in a tub full of cold water on the day you pick it up. Keep it in a cool location until you hang it. Purchase an empty spray bottle and fill it with cold water and spray your greenery every day. If possible keep it out of sunlight or away from heat vents to prolong life. All information and the registration link can be found at https://rowan.ces.ncsu.edu/2021/09/4-h-wreath-homemade-soap/.

According to the Business Club the prices were boosted by rising prices of raw materials particularly hydrofluoric acid and trichloroethylene.

Some refrigerant companies are also said to have carried out overhauls of production equipment and in some cases stopped production in August. This combined with electricity restrictions in many places has further impacted prices.

The figures are based on the China Producer Price Index (PPI) which measures the average change in price of goods and services sold by manufacturers and producers in the wholesale market during a given period.",,,,,,,,,,,,

After all it could also be of tremendous value to you in the future. Anyone at any time can join the disability community so by making the world more inclusive now you can help future generations as well.

Did you know that approximately one in four people have a disability? By encouraging destinations to be inclusive of all travelers and speaking up if accessibility is limited in a tourist site you are not only potentially helping yourself for the future but you are also helping your extended family friends and everyone in general.

For more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter.

Below is a list of ways you can be the best ally to disabled travelers. As a wheelchair user myself I thank you for taking the time to read this article and taking the actions below.

Support legislation that improves accessibility

The Air Carrier Access Act prohibits discrimination by air carriers against individuals with disabilities. The ACAA has provided regulations for 35 years but it is in need of an update. Currently the Air Carrier Access Amendments Act is trying to be passed in congress. It would strengthen enforcement of the ACAA require airlines to meet accessibility standards and most importantly improve the safety of air travel for passengers with disabilities. You can ask your members of Congress to support this bill by filling out this simple form online.

The airline industry is very aware of the rights of disabled passengers but as stressors arise in the airport there may be times that fairness is overlooked. If you are on a plane or in an airport and see someone in a wheelchair being treated unfairly remind the airline of the ACAA.

Support organizations that are working to make travel more accessible

All Wheels Up for example is an incredible organization that is pushing for wheelchair users to be able to remain in their wheelchair during flight.

Currently the wheelchair is stowed beneath the plane and the wheelchair user has to be transferred from their wheelchair into a small ""aisle chair"" and then again transferred into the plane seat. This makes the flight very uncomfortable as most wheelchairs are custom-fitted. The wheelchairs also are often damaged during flight (an average of 29 wheelchairs are damaged per day on flights) which not only causes the wheelchair user days weeks or even months of discomfort and immobility but also costs the airline millions of dollars every year in repairs.

By donating to organizations like All Wheels Up travelers of all abilities will one day be able to enjoy flying without the stress of being manhandled by the airline crew members or having a wheelchair damaged. Every dollar that is donated to All Wheels Up goes toward improving the air travel process for wheelchair users.

Speak up when you see inaccessibility while traveling

You've probably heard the phrase ""When you see something say something"" right? Well this is one of the best and easiest things that you as an able-bodied traveler can do to help improve accessibility in the destinations you visit.

For example if you are walking up stairs into a restaurant ask a worker if there is another entrance for wheelchair users. You may get them thinking about accessibility for the first time just by asking that simple question. They may have never even thought about this scenario before. Often the workers will even say ""Well we never have customers in wheelchairs here so we really do not need a ramp"" but remind them that wheelchair users may have tried to visit but cannot due to the inaccessibility.

By speaking up about accessibility in a kind manner you could be the reason why a restaurant shop or attraction becomes accessible.

Share accessibility insights online

When writing about your travel experiences post-trip whether on TripAdvisor Yelp your own social media pages or somewhere else on the internet always include info on accessibility of the location you're writing about.

Accessible travel information is often extremely difficult to find online but even if you just put one sentence saying that whatever attraction you visited had a ramp to enter that could be a huge help. You don't have to go into full accessibility detail but any bit of information is super helpful.

The more accessibility information that we can make available online the easier trips will be to plan in the future and the more mainstream accessibility will become.

Use accessible travel companies to plan your own trips

Use accessible travel booking platforms like Handiscover to book hotel rooms or use accessibility-focused tour companies to help support them. Sure sites like Handiscover do specialize in accessibility but they also allow you to book standard rooms.

Likewise many companies that offer accessible tours also offer tours for non-disabled travelers. However the opposite is not usually true. By supporting tour companies and booking platforms that cater to all travelers instead of spending your hard-earned money on discriminatory companies this puts more money in the pockets of inclusive companies and therefore they will be able to provide better accessible features to accommodate wheelchair users.

As you can see there are multiple ways that you can be an ally for disabled travelers and none of the above scenarios take away from your own travel experiences. They are just helping to improve travel for people of all abilities. By being an ally you will not only improve the lives of others but it could also improve your outlook on travel and enable you to have a more fulfilling trip.

“The start of issuing tourist visas after a hiatus of 19 months won’t mean that a flood of travelers would be arriving in Iran” Pourfaraj said in a tourism webinar on Friday.

The Islamic Republic is set to resume tourist visas by next month after months of suspension amid strict government measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus the tourism minister announced on September 27 concurrent with World Tourism Day.

“[Iranian] travel companies are due to start talks to foreign sides… so far these negotiations have not taken place because we did not have a clear answer about the status of foreign tourist reception in Iran” the expert explained.

Elsewhere in his remarks Pourfaraj pointed to the mass vaccination of Iranian nationals against COVID-19 which has gained momentum across the country.

“In addition to visas progress in mass vaccinations steadily enhance public health and now we can talk about the health safety in the country” he added.

Over the past couple of weeks the number of people testing positive for COVID-19 has continued to fall in the Islamic Republic curbing a stubborn fifth wave of the pandemic which has seen daily mortalities of up to 700. As of October 1 the figure dropped to below 250 as the government has devoted a great deal of effort to vaccinate citizens against the nasty virus.

Furthermore the expert reminded that Iran is one of the most wallet-friendly destinations in the world adding: “While the economies of many countries are affected by the coronavirus this inexpensiveness is an advantage.

However months of steep recession has taken its toll. Many travel insiders hoteliers and tour operators have faced big dilemmas such as bankruptcy unemployment debts and the prospects of not being competitive on the international level.

In November 2020 the World Tourism Organization announced that international tourist arrivals to Iran plunged 72% during the first eight months of 2020 when compared to 2019 highlighting the severe impact of COVID-19 as the main factor.

Over the past couple of months Pourfaraj had frequently asked the government to issue tourist visas for the international applicants who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. “The Ministry of Health and the National Headquarters for Coronavirus Control can at least agree that the international tourists who have received the [second dose of] coronavirus vaccine would be allowed to enter Iran.”

Earlier this year the expert lamented “the continuation of such a trend would result in losing international tourist markets more than before.”

According to Pourfaraj reasonable prices of Iran tours are expected to bring back the boom into the tourism sector of the country in the post coronavirus era. “Attractive tour plans are also being prepared for those who are eager to explore the historical attractions and natural wonders of the ancient country and want to experience a vacation here.”

He also expressed hope that international tour operators and companies who have worked with their Iranian counterparts for years would put Iran back on the world’s travel route again considering the facilities they can get at cheaper prices than in other countries.

Referring to health tourism as a popular branch in Iran he believes that medical services in Iran are provided at a lower price than what may be offered at double the price in other countries.

Back in January he announced that the tourist flow from across the world to Iran will return to normal in 2022. Although there are requests for traveling to Iran in the current year (2021) most travel agencies and tour operators believe that the flow will go back to normal in the next year he explained. “Beginning mass vaccination against the coronavirus will provide better and safe conditions for international travels in 2022.”

Some experts believe Iran is still somehow “unknown” for many potential travelers due to Western “media war”. Several estimates have been released so far on the extent of the tourism-related losses incurred by the pandemic. Only months into the outbreak former tourism minister Ali Asghar Mounesan lamented that the number of foreign travelers to Iran was drastically plunged due to the pandemic.

“Tourism of the country was growing before the corona [outbreak] its revenues reached $11.7 billion in 2019 which accounted for 2.8% of GDP nearing the average share of tourism in the world GDP which was 3.2 percent” Mounesan said. He added 8.7 million foreign nationals visited Iran during the [Iranian] year (1398) adding that Iran was ranked as the second fastest-growing country in tourism based on data compiled by the World Tourism Organization.

Iran is potentially a booming destination for travelers seeking cultural attractions breathtaking sceneries and numerous UNESCO-registered sites. Under the 2025 Tourism Vision Plan Iran aims to increase the number of tourist arrivals from 4.8 million in 2014 to 20 million in 2025.

Even before the pandemic Iran’s tourism was already grappling with some challenges on top of those Western “media propaganda” aimed at scaring potential travelers away from the Islamic Republic. Some experts believe Iran is still somehow “unknown” for many potential travelers due to such a “media war”. They however consider bright prospects for the tourism sector of the country if it vigorously pursues comprehensive strategies to counter U.S.-led propaganda and strict sanctions yet does its best to loosen tough travel regulations.

The ancient land embraces hundreds of historical sites such as bazaars museums mosques bridges bathhouses madrasas mausoleums churches towers and mansions of which 26 being inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list.

It’s true that most of the hops used by Japanese brewers are imports from countries like Germany the Czech Republic and the United States but about 5% is produced domestically with the small Iwate Prefecture town of Tono which has been farming hops for nearly 60 years contributing the lion’s share.

Like many rural farming communities Tono (population 26000) has been impacted not only by an aging population and urban migration but the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake as well. Around 20 years ago there were 239 hops farms in Tono but the number now stands at just 22 and production is down to less than a fifth of its 1989 peak of 647 tons.",,,

A&T STATISTICAL LEADERS: RB Jah-Maine Martin (14 rushes 106 yards 2 TD); QB Jalen Fowler (15-for-20 206 yards 2 TD 7 rushes 76 yards); DE Jermaine McDaniel (5 tackles 3 unassisted 2.0 sacks 2 TFLs 2 QBHs); Najee Reams (8 tackles 5 unassisted); Amir McNeil l (2 PBUs); Richie Kittles (6 tackles 1 unassisted 2.5 TFLs); Jacob Roberts (5 tackles 1 unassisted 1.5 TFLs 1 INT).

RMU STATISTICAL LEADERS: QB George Martin (17-for-31 203 yards 1 TD); RB Jonathan Wynn (3 rushes 44 yards 1 TD); LB Jamar Shegog (9 tackles)

WHY A&T GOT THE ""W"": The Aggies capitalized on red zone opportunities going 5-for-5 (4 TDs 1 FGs) inside RMU's 20-yard line. The Aggies put forth a balanced attack with 222 passing yards and 224 rushing yards for a season-high 446 total yards of offense. They got pretty much whatever they wanted on that side of the ball not punting a single time all day.



WHY RMU DIDN'T GET THE ""W"": The Colonials could not get anything going in the run game averaging just 2.0 yards per carry and amounting to 54 yards for the game. Special teams mishaps put RMU in lousy field position throughout the day as well. RMU had the ball trailing by six 20-14 with a chance to take the lead but a three-and-out put those hopes to bed quickly. Punter George Souders shanked the punt that went just 20 yards giving A&T the ball near midfield which they took advantage of with a four-play 51-yard score culminating in a Martin touchdown run.

CRUCIAL: RMU put forth a 14-play 96-yard drive that took up almost six minutes cutting A&T's lead to six 13-7 with 23 seconds remaining in the first half. However another special teams mishap for the Colonials allowed Taymon Cooke a 35-yard return on the ensuing kickoff giving the Aggies an opportunity starting at the RMU 45. Fowler threw a 23-yard strike to Jamison Warren with eight seconds remaining and one shot at the end zone before a field goal attempt. Instead Fowler tossed a jump ball toward Zach Leslie who did his best basketball impression boxing out his defender and snagging the ball out of the air with no time left on the clock giving the Aggies a 20-7 lead and all the momentum heading into the break.

THE STORY: EAST GREENSBORO – The Aggies started the Big South Conference the way they ended play in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) – dominant at home. North Carolina A&T bested their first-ever Big South opponent Robert Morris 41-14 Saturday at Truist Stadium to improve to 42-6 on their home grass over the last decade.

The Aggies had a day on the offensive side of the ball scoring a season-high 41 points on a season-high 446 yards of offense. All-American running back Jah-Maine Martin played like just that an all-American recording his first 100-yard rushing game of the season to go along with two touchdowns. A&T head coach Sam Washington said on Monday that he knew Martin's time would come and unfortunately for the Colonials it came on Saturday.

Joining Martin in the offensive coming-out party was quarterback Jalen Fowler  who not only had an excellent passing day but he was also the team's second-leading rusher.

Reigning Big South special teamer of the week Andrew ""Money"" Brown continued his consistency in the kicking game knocking through two field goals (35-yard and 20-yard) on Saturday as well as five extra points.

RMU won the coin toss and deferred their reception of the kickoff to the second half putting the ball in the Aggies hands first. With that A&T drove 47 yards on 10 plays and a 35-yard field goal from Brown put them up 3-0 early.

The stout A&T defense forced a turnover on downs on the Colonials' first drive and the offense took full advantage this time going 64 yards on eight plays. Freshman running back Bhayshul Tuten scored his second-career touchdown on an 18-yard scamper to finish the drive and put A&T up 10-0.

Another field goal by Brown had A&T up 13-0 before RMU put together a 96-yard touchdown drive right before the half. A&T's quick response was a 35-yard kickoff return by Taymon Cooke that put the ball at the RMU 45. Then two Fowler completions later the return of Zach Leslie happened. Playing in his first game after missing the first three Leslie went up and caught a huge 22-yard TD pass to end any momentum the Colonials had.

RMU did respond with an opening second-half drive that went 75 yards in seven plays ending with a Jonathan Wynn 40-yard TD run to make it 20-14. But from that point on the Aggies outscored the Colonials 21-0. Martin scored her first two touchdowns of the season in the process.

QUOTABLE: ""Very excited to win the first ballgame within the Big South Conference. It was a tough ballgame for a while there. They (RMU) came in and they were well-prepared. They were focused and they came in to win but I think our guys were able to stay focused and humble and stay after it. I thought they got after it really well.""

A&T Head Coach Sam Washington on the big win Saturday

""Yay! That's a coach's dream because now you're able to manage the clock while running the football and then you're controlling the game with the pass. I tip my hat to this young man ( Jalen Fowler ). He did an enormous job with that.""

I am pretty sure that they just needed to hit a diversity requirement.”

That was what my high school classmate told me when I discussed that I was accepted into Wake Forest University. For some time I thought that person was right. I had only a 900 on the SAT and an 18 on the ACT. Furthermore my GPA wasn’t the highest compared with my other classmates’. I wasn’t the smartest person in the room most times. All of this caused doubt in my head.

When I graduated high school and made my way to Winston-Salem I didn’t know what to expect. I was truly concerned what people would think of me if I told them my scores or my GPA. I just wanted to run away from the real Miles. I created almost a facade — this stellar and high-achieving high school student who got into all the great schools had a high SAT/ACT and had high grades coming in. I was lying to myself and trying to hide who I really was — a Star Wars-loving social butterfly average student who happened to get into Wake Forest.

It wasn’t until my mentors — my professors administrators and classmates whom I was more honest with — began to tell me not to be ashamed of who I was that I could revert back to the Miles I believed in. We all fall into the trap of letting society dictate who we should be how we should think and more importantly who deserves what. I wanted to change that.

I worked hard at Wake to ensure that I was putting my best foot forward. I wanted to have no regrets when I left campus each time the semester ended. My accomplishments at Wake Forest would almost be a fantasy to high school Miles: dean’s list student magna cum laude graduate president of the student government Army ROTC battalion commander and now 2nd Lt. Miles Middleton in the infantry.

Remember that you cannot do college alone; find friends who will uplift you and make you think differently.

There are lessons I think students and others should know that I learned in my time at Wake. I would start by saying that maybe there are those out there whether it be in high school or starting a college career who doubt who they are and want to create a fictional character in order to run away from the past. I say to them embrace your past and who you are so you are able to learn and grow as an individual. Remember that you cannot do college alone; find friends who will uplift you and make you think differently.

Additionally lean on your professors. Thank goodness the professors I had were understanding and always available to help. I’ve taken three professors from my majors (history and politics and international affairs) four to five times each building my relationship with each one. Many thanks to Charles “Will” Walldorf Jr. (P ’17 ’24) associate professor of politics and international affairs; Charles Wilkins associate professor of history; and Heidi Robinson (MA ’11 P ’18 ’20) assistant vice president of the Career Education and Training Office in Personal and Career Development and associate professor of the practice in the Department of Education. They helped me find my calling and career.

More advice: Don’t be afraid to express yourself to others and tell them what you believe but don’t have a closed mind when you’re in the classroom. Try to listen as much as possible to others.

Lastly take care of yourself. You do not have to be involved in everything. You have to be able to say no to the good and yes to the best opportunities that will advance your career and perspective.

Wake Forest gave me hope courage and the ability to dream. Now I am going to take all of the lessons learned to the next assignment God has given me serving in our Armed Forces. It’s not a goodbye but see you later and thank you!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcnRoamVyc2V5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvbWxiL21ldHMvMjAyMS8xMC8wMi9tZXRzLWpkLWRhdmlzLWluanVyeS1zdXJnZXJ5LWxpZ2FtZW50LWxlZnQtaGFuZC81OTQ4ODA1MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,J.D. Davis: NY Mets' 3B needs surgery on left hand,"ATLANTA — J.D. Davis will undergo offseason surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left hand he told The Record/NorthJersey.com on the field at Truist Park before Saturday's Mets-Braves game.

Right after the season ends Davis will fly into Cincinnati Ohio and then drive to Dayton where Dr. Thomas Graham an orthopedic surgeon will perform the surgery on Tuesday. Davis who will undergo the procedure to repair a ligament between the middle and ring fingers on that left hand said Graham will take localized tissue to reinforce the area.

Davis said Graham described the issue as being like a ""stretched rubber band that's just not coming back.""

Davis a third baseman will require two months off after the surgery. He'll be in a splint for four to six weeks and once he's out of that he'll slowly begin gripping things with his left hand. He expects to be fully healthy long before spring training.

He hopes this marks the end of this hand injury.

""To be honest it’s been frustrating having to deal with this injury and at the same time not really have a clear understanding of what we should be doing to get it to be 100%"" Davis wrote in a text. ""Frankly I didn’t expect to get surgery. Based upon the team’s evaluations throughout the year surgery sounded unnecessary and so I tried to grind through it. It became apparent recently through additional testing that surgery was now the way to go given how the hand was still feeling.""

Davis is relieved to be handling the problem

Davis hopes the surgery means the end of a frustrating saga with that left hand. Davis who is finishing the season on the injured list has now been on the injured list three times this season — the last two times because of the torn ligament. He has only logged 179 at-bats this season because of injuries and being relegated to a bench player over the final month of the season.

Luis Rojas:The case for and against keeping him as NY Mets manager

However Davis proved to be a valuable hitter for the Mets even if he felt like he only had one healthy hand for most of the season. He hit .285 with an .820 on-base plug slugging percentage. He hit five home runs and drove in 23 runs.

""Coming into this season my personal expectations were very high"" Davis wrote in a text. ""I worked as hard as I ever have this last offseason and had the right mindset but felt like the injury derailed me a bit. Getting hit in the hand and tearing a ligament in that same hand put a damper on things. I just couldn’t perform the way I needed to after that. I was being told it shouldn’t take that long to heal so thought I could gut it out for the rest of the season but after getting two injections and completing months of rehab it just never got better.

""At this point though I’m relieved that the problem was identified and we are finally able to do something about it.""

It's unclear if the 28-year-old Davis will be back with the Mets who shopped him around in potential trades multiple times over the last year. He's always said he would miss New York but he understands baseball is a business.

Two options

The Mets and Davis decided between two options in this situation:

1. Davis undergoes the surgery right after the season

2. Davis rests the hand and the team re-evaluates it after a month and a half or two months

The sides chose the first option which will allow Davis to have the most normal offseason possible. He can use it to get ready to play for whichever team — whether

Until Davis' left hand is fully healthy he'll do everything with his right hand. Davis always takes October off after a baseball season and will do the same this year. He said he won't begin lifting until early November and he'll start with lower-body work before progressing to lifting with his right hand. He'll use a training bar for deadlifts and squats before his left hand completely heals.

Mets roster moves

Before they lost 6-5 to the Braves on Saturday they reinstated right-hander Robert Gsellman from the 60-day injured list. Gsellman who suffered a torn right lat in June pitched to a 3.71 ERA over 26 2/3 innings before the injury. He hadn't pitched since June 19 before allowing a run in an inning of work in Saturday's game.

To clear space for him the Mets optioned rookie starter Tylor Megill to Triple-A Syracuse while recalling Brandon Drury and designating him for assignment.

Megill who entered the Mets' rotation out of necessity ended his rookie season by posting a 4.52 ERA over 18 starts.

Coming off an impressive outing earlier in the week after a two-year injury riddled hiatus Noah Syndergaard's second-and-final appearance of the season didn't go nearly as well on Sunday.

Working as an opener against the Atlanta Braves Syndergaard threw 16-pitches and was touched up for two-runs on three hits in his lone inning at Truist Park.

This was Syndergaard's last outing of the season before he hits the free agent market for the first time in his career.

He finished the year with a 9.00 ERA and 1.50 WHIP across two total innings due to his poor performance today. However Syndergaard struck out two batters in a scoreless inning on Tuesday.

Syndergaard is set to become a free agent this winter but has made it clear that he wants to stay with the Mets next season.

""I'm fairly confident that we will reach an agreement and I'll be pitching here next year"" said Syndergaard after his initial return on Tuesday. ""New York has a special place in my heart.""

And according to team president Sandy Alderson the Mets will decide on whether they will extend qualifying offers to Syndergaard and Michael Conforto in the coming weeks.

At this point it appears that Syndergaard will accept the QO if the Mets offer it as the right-handed pitcher said he'd be ""grateful"" if this were to happen.

From 2015-19 Syndergaard emerged as one of the top starting pitchers in baseball for the Mets. After undergoing Tommy John surgery in 2020 Syndergaard was knocked out for two full-seasons prior to returning on September 28 2021.

Due to his potential as a top of the rotation starter the Mets would be greatly rewarded if he were to bounce back for them next season. And so would Syndergaard who is looking to build his value back up next year before possibly re-entering free agency after 2022."

The summer heat waves might be behind us but don’t brush them off just yet. Temperatures are increasing (July 2021 was the hottest month on record) and we can expect it to keep getting hotter. How will we cope besides cranking up the A/C?

People from Ancient Egypt to the Persian Empire have been beating the heat for millennia. And their solution the “wind catcher” could help us once more in our quest for emissions-free cooling.

The problem: It is hot. It is going to get hotter.

87% of all U.S. homes are equipped with air conditioners and air conditioning accounts for 12% of residential energy use. Besides the fossil fuels that power them many use refrigerants to cool the air which can be potent greenhouse gasses if released.

In addition air conditioners cool us down by capturing heat from the interior of buildings but they expel that heat outside directly warming the environment and contributing to the urban heat island effect.

And ironically the warmer it gets the more cool air we blast and the more electricity we consume.

The solution: Innovators are working hard to find ways to cope with the new normal — extreme heat and rising temperatures. The creativity is high from apps that help pedestrians find cool walks and shady spots to next-generation technologies like cooling paper that lowers the temperature inside homes.

Although heatwaves are encroaching on otherwise cool climates there have always been hot places on the planet. And if people live there then they’ve found ways to manage the heat.

In the hot arid Iranian Plateau ancient structures called “wind catchers” are attracting academics engineers and architects who want to find creative new (and old) ways to cool off.

The wind catchers or bâdgir in Persian are common structures that extend above the rooftops in rectangular towers reports BBC. They made life livable. And because they cool a building without using electricity or fuel they are an attractive green solution.

How it works: Wind catchers are tall chimney-like structures that extend from the roof of a building. They harness cool wind and direct it throughout the building.

Wind catchers are designed differently based on the prevailing winds and temperatures in a local region. The most uncomplicated design faces the tower opening toward the prevailing wind to create natural ventilation. But local climates are complicated and often wind catchers had many features: filters passive cooling systems (by passing hot air over cool water) or multiple openings to account for varied wind directions.

Researchers at Weber State University in the United States told Sustainability Times that “these systems were eventually refined to the point that they could at times reach refrigeration temperatures.”

Many things were considered when designing a tower — the layout of the building the addition of internal blades — to optimize how the cool air was drawn into the home and hot air expelled.

Will we resurrect this ancient technology: Parham Kheirkhah Sangdeh a researcher at Ilam University in Iran studies the scientific application and culture of wind catchers in contemporary architecture. He says that pests dust and debris motivated people to stop using traditional wind catchers and adopt Western technology.

“There needs to be some changes in cultural perspectives to use these technologies. People need to keep an eye on the past and understand why energy conservation is important” Kheirkhah Sangdeh told BBC. “It starts with recognising cultural history and the importance of energy conservation.”

But the technology isn’t gone completely.

Free Running Buildings is a start-up creating commercially available products in the U.K. based on ancient wind towers. Their “FREECOOL” technology will top the newly renovated Khalifa International Stadium in Doha Qatar — just in time for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

MAS Architecture Studio in Dubai created a wind tower to keep students cool using 480 layers of recycled cardboard.

Terms of the purchase were not disclosed and finalizing the deal requires the approval of MFM stakeholders.

Tyson operates a plant and an innovation center in the country currently and a Tyson international business official said the partnership will increase its footprint and diversify its offerings and distribution of products. MFM was established in 1961 and has evolved to become a leading flour miller in Malaysia. MFM also maintains feed mills processing facilities hatcheries and farms in the country and has become a leading poultry company there for the past 30 years. The value of the halal poultry market is forecast to top $147 billion in the next five years with halal exports accounting for $9 billion.

“Once completed the poultry deal will optimize our existing Malaysia business and expand MFM’s poultry business” said Chris Langholz Tyson’s international president. “This partnership will add more supply flexibility for both companies in serving halal-certified poultry to consumers and customers in the country and across priority export markets.”

In fiscal 2020 Tyson’s international sales topped $6 billion including exports from the United States which makes the partnership favorable for both companies according to MFM’s top executive.

“Tyson Foods is one of the world’s largest food production companies with a strong global manufacturing and distribution footprint” said Teh Wee Chye MFM’s managing director. “Malaysia is one of the key poultry markets in Southeast Asia with a high per-capita consumption of poultry. Together with Tyson Foods we look forward to increasing our halal poultry product offerings in the country especially in the further processed poultry segment as well as exporting to demand markets with the help of Tyson Foods’ global network.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbnNwYXBlcnMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvaGlmZi1maWxtLXJldmlldy1zdG9ybS1sYWtlLWRvY3VtZW50YXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HIFF Review: 'Storm Lake',ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.danspapers.com/2021/10/hiff-film-review-storm-lake-documentary/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbnNwYXBlcnMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvaGlmZi1maWxtLXJldmlldy1zdG9ybS1sYWtlLWRvY3VtZW50YXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXRldXJnb2xmLmNvbS9nb2xmLXRvdXJuYW1lbnQtbmV3cy8yODI0MS9CbGVzc2luZ3MtQ29sbGVnaWF0ZS0tMjAyMS1UVi1UaW1lcy0tTElWRS1TQ09SSU5H0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blessings Collegiate: 2021 TV Times LIVE SCORING,The second playing of the Blessings Collegiate Invitational tees off Monday at Blessings Golf Club just outside of Fayetteville Arkansas.

The Northwest Arkansas Council and allies launched an ad campaign Monday in three cities after a test run in Austin Texas. The campaign wants to draw people who have technical talent or are starting a business -- or both -- to Northwest Arkansas. The effort will continue in Austin and expand into Denver Minneapolis and Seattle.

""It sounds like you're trying to do to us what we did to California"" said Bryan Poppe spokesman for the Austin mayor's office when asked Wednesday about the Northwest Arkansas effort.

The campaign – ""Life Works Here"" – grew out of last year's incentive-based relocation campaign created by the council with the same name. That campaign offered $10000 and a mountain bike to professionals working from home in other parts of the country who moved to Northwest Arkansas.

To date 53 of those professionals received grants -- and 34243 applications were received. Those applications had addresses on them said Frances Webster co-founder and chief executive officer of Walrus. The New York-based advertising agency implemented the next phase of the program along with St. Louis-based public relations agency FleishmanHillard.

The ad agencies used research data showing where top-tier technical talent lives as the top criteria to select the four cities Webster said. The applications for the cash awards and the mountain bikes shed light on where people who are interested in Northwest Arkansas live she said. Every one of those 34243 applications contained an address. That helped with city selection she said.

The campaign received money from the Alice L. Walton Foundation J.B. Hunt Transport Services Simmons Foods Tyson Foods Walmart and the Walton Family Foundation said Nelson Peacock president and chief executive of the Northwest Arkansas Council. The council is coordinating the campaign and announced it Monday.

""It's an expensive proposition"" Peacock said when asked about the effort's cost. He declined to give specifics.

This effort isn't trying to spur growth where there is no demand for it he said.

""We have 10381 jobs we could fill right now"" he said.

The Austin mayor's office had no further comment and the Austin Chamber of Commerce declined comment.

Mention New York City Chicago Los Angeles – or Austin Seattle Denver and Minneapolis – and a definite mental picture springs to mind for most people Webster said. People who have never seen one of those cities still have impressions of each.

Northwest Arkansas isn't so set in the public mind she said.

""The product is amazing but people have to come and see it"" Webster said.

One reason the region lacks a conspicuous national profile is also one of its strengths Webster said. The region is a work in progress. The still-growing aspect is a strong draw among people who inquire about it she said. People considering a move there like the idea of helping to shape the community.

""You can have an impact on what's happening in the region"" she said. And the region has strong leadership working to make sure success doesn't spoil the quality of life she said.

Other cities made mistakes during their periods of rapid growth mistakes Northwest Arkansas wants to avoid Peacock said. Traffic congestion and runaway housing prices for instance are the consequences of growth without careful planning.

Getting a grip on such problems won't be easy but Northwest Arkansas groups such as the council its allies and cities within the region are making a coordinated effort at it according to Webster.

""This will be a model for urban planners for decades to come"" she said of the region's efforts.

The advantages Northwest Arkansas has over other congested urban centers are things the region should want to keep Peacock said.

""We have a cost calculator that compares cities and find a lot of differences in costs where Northwest Arkansas has an advantage"" Peacock said. ""Things like housing prices and cost of living are big components but we're also finding things like the time spent commuting in other cities is an advantage for us.

""The market does not take care of these things on its own"" Peacock said. Regional effort on housing transportation workforce development and quality of life issues like trails and preserving the local environment are all needed he said.

BALANCING ACT

Choosing to live in a bigger more-developed city often requires sacrifices in family considerations Webster said. Northwest Arkansas keeps a balance she said. The region is a good place to build a career and raise a family.

The potential for family was one consideration in her decision to move there said Kim Bryden founder and chief executive of Cureate. Her business helps market local sources advising producers and retailers.

""If you have a business on the side making ice cream or salsa and would like to leave your day job and do that full time we help you"" she said. Likewise if you're a grocer cafeteria coffee shop or other business offering food and would like to connect with local suppliers Cureate will make those arrangements.

Bryden's business succeeded in the mid-Atlantic states from the company's base in Washington D.C. according to Bryden and news accounts. She wanted to expand the business and decided the best way to pick a new location was to go take a look -- driving from Washington and scouting locations from West Virginia to New Mexico.

Northwest Arkansas appealed to her before she knew the $10000 reward and mountain bike prize was available. She applied won and moved to the region in July.

Bryden doesn't have children but wants them in the future she said. That was a factor in choosing this location with its attractions and access to still-unspoiled nature. But it was only one factor. The entrepreneurial outlook of local suppliers and merchants; the support received from local chambers the council and others; the room to grow the business; and other factors made the decision she said.

""Everything just clicked"" she added.

""If you had asked me about Northwest Arkansas before I came here I would have said 'What?'"" Bryden said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMDEvdXMvY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1jb3ZpZC1tYW5kYXRlLXZhY2NpbmUtc3R1ZGVudHMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,California to Mandate Covid-19 Vaccines for All Students as Soon as Next Fall (Published 2021),"SACRAMENTO — California’s governor on Friday issued the nation’s first statewide Covid-19 vaccine mandate for schoolchildren saying they would be required as soon as next fall to be inoculated against the coronavirus to attend public and private schools in the state.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s order adds the coronavirus vaccine to other inoculations such as for measles and mumps that are required for nearly seven million students to attend K-12 schools in person. The mandate will first apply to seventh through 12th grades and then kindergarten through sixth grades but only after the Food and Drug Administration grants full approval to a vaccine for those age groups.

The mandate is one of the largest announced during a coronavirus pandemic that has torn through the country claiming more than 700000 lives disrupting education and hobbling the economy.

Another sweeping order that requires health care workers to be vaccinated took effect on Thursday in California following similar — and in some cases even more stringent — mandates in New York Rhode Island Maine Oregon and the District of Columbia. In Connecticut state employees school employees and child care workers have until Oct. 4 to get at least one vaccine dose. And major corporations including United Airlines and Tyson Foods have mandated coronavirus vaccines for hundreds of thousands of workers."

Case Keenum Mayfield's backup quarterback in Cleveland knows a thing or two about it as co-author and triggerman of the Minneapolis Miracle back on Jan. 14 2018.

""There are so many memories from that play"" Keenum said this week as the Browns prepared for their first game at U.S. Bank Stadium on Sunday. ""I thought it was the loudest thing I ever heard in my life when [Stefon] Diggs turned to run. And it kept getting even louder and crazier.""

The Vikings of course were trailing the Saints 24-23 and facing third-and-10 from their 39-yard line. Ten seconds remained. Saints coach Sean Payton was mocking the crowd by doing the ""Skol Chant"" clap on the opposite sideline.

""Karma works in mysterious ways Sean"" laughed Browns defensive end Ifeadi Odenigbo who was a rookie on the Vikings practice squad.

Keenum swaggered into the huddle and gave the play call.

""Gun Buffalo Right Key Left Seven Heaven"" Keenum said this week. ""I'll never forget it.""

Adam Thielen ran an out route to the left and was well covered. Tight end Kyle Rudolph receiver Jarius Wright and Diggs all ran routes toward the right sideline. Rudolph was shallow Wright medium and Diggs deep.

""I was telling people this week I was right there when Diggs caught the ball"" said Odenigbo reaching for his phone.

""You'll love this photo. Look right there. I'm wearing the hat and looking like 'What the heck is happening?!'""

Diggs caught the ball at the Saints 34-yard line.

""I had a perfect view from the other sideline"" Thielen said this week. ""I'm yelling 'Get out of bounds! Get out of bounds!'""

But Diggs didn't get out of bounds. Rookie safety Marcus Williams whiffed with one of the worst missed tackles in playoff history. Diggs came down turned and was gone — the first time in NFL playoff history a game ended on a touchdown as time expired.

""They say Kansas City is the loudest stadium in the NFL"" Odenigbo said. ""I beg to differ man.""

Case Keenum right now backs up Baker Mayfield left for the Browns.

Arrowhead Stadium earned that distinction by registering a decibel level of 142.2 in a game in 2014. It wrested the record from Seattle's 12th Man which weighed in at 137.6 a year earlier.

""Telling guys this week I'm like 'Dude U.S. Bank Stadium gets really really loud' "" Odenigbo said. ""I don't know what measurement gets used but all I know is the Minneapolis Miracle would have set the record.""

Browns coach Kevin Stefanski who spent 14 seasons as a Vikings assistant coach was asked this week whether he thinks the larger U.S. Bank Stadium is as tough on opponents as the cramped and claustrophobia-inducing Metrodome.

""They are both really loud"" Stefanski said. ""We talked about it already [Wednesday] morning. U.S. Bank Stadium is a glass building and the noise reverberates in there. It will be the loudest likely the loudest place that we play in this year.""

Pushed on whether he thinks it's louder than the Metrodome Stefanski said ""Yeah I do.""

That might be stretching the truth a bit just to keep Vikings fans from stretching their lungs to prove him wrong.

But …

""I wouldn't say that there's any stadium that's louder"" Thielen said. ""Some of the loudest would be Seattle the Superdome the Chiefs. But I just don't see it getting any louder than some of the big games we've had at U.S. Bank.""

The Minneapolis Miracle was Keenum's last home game with the Vikings. The journeyman backup who started the season as Sam Bradford's caddie ended up going 11-3 and leading the Vikings to the NFC Championship Game which they were mauled in at Philadelphia.

""I wanted to stay in Minnesota no question about that"" said Keenum who went on to play in Denver and Washington before joining the Browns last year. ""For whatever reason those guys didn't want me. Never really made an offer to bring me back. It is what it is. They went with Kirk [Cousins].""

Keenum started for Washington in a 19-9 loss at U.S. Bank Stadium in 2019. Two years later he'll once again walk into the building and look over to the spot where he and Diggs firmly stamped themselves into Vikings history.

""I probably won't be able to go into that building the rest of my life without thinking about that night"" Keenum said. ""And that noise.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzhlYTZkOTc3LWMyZmMtNDdhOC05ZDkzLTFlYzAyZWI0ZjlhOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Monzo withdraws US banking licence application,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

The secret documents expose offshore dealings of the King of Jordan the presidents of Ukraine Kenya and Ecuador the prime minister of the Czech Republic and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The files also detail financial activities of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “unofficial minister of propaganda” and more than 130 billionaires from Russia the United States Turkey and other nations.

The leaked records reveal that many of the power players who could help bring an end to the offshore system instead benefit from it – stashing assets in covert companies and trusts while their governments do little to slow a global stream of illicit money that enriches criminals and impoverishes nations.

Among the hidden treasures revealed in the documents:

A $22 million chateau in the French Riviera – replete with a cinema and two swimming pools – purchased through offshore companies by the Czech Republic’s populist prime minister a billionaire who has railed against the corruption of economic and political elites.

More than $13 million tucked in a secrecy-shaded trust in the Great Plains of the United States by a scion of one of Guatemala’s most powerful families a dynasty that controls a soap and lipsticks conglomerate that’s been accused of harming workers and the earth.

Three beachfront mansions in Malibu purchased through three offshore companies for $68 million by the King of Jordan in the years after Jordanians filled the streets during Arab Spring to protest joblessness and corruption.

The secret records are known as the Pandora Papers.

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists obtained the trove of more than 11.9 million confidential files and led a team of more than 600 journalists from 150 news outlets that spent two years sifting through them tracking down hard-to-find sources and digging into court records and other public documents from dozens of countries.

The leaked records come from 14 offshore services firms from around the world that set up shell companies and other offshore nooks for clients often seeking to keep their financial activities in the shadows. The records include information about the dealings of nearly three times as many current and former country leaders as any previous leak of documents from offshore havens.

In an era of widening authoritarianism and inequality the Pandora Papers investigation provides an unequaled perspective on how money and power operate in the 21st century – and how the rule of law has been bent and broken around the world by a system of financial secrecy enabled by the U.S. and other wealthy nations.

The findings by ICIJ and its media partners spotlight how deeply secretive finance has infiltrated global politics – and offer insights into why governments and global organizations have made little headway in ending offshore financial abuses.

An ICIJ analysis of the secret documents identified 956 companies in offshore havens tied to 336 high-level politicians and public officials including country leaders cabinet ministers ambassadors and others. More than two-thirds of those companies were set up in the British Virgin Islands a jurisdiction long known as a key cog in the offshore system.

At least $11.3 trillion is held “offshore” according to a 2020 study by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Because of the complexity and secrecy of the offshore system it’s not possible to know how much of that wealth is tied to tax evasion and other crimes and how much of it involves funds that come from legitimate sources and have been reported to proper authorities.

Every corner of the world

The Pandora Papers investigation unmasks the covert owners of offshore companies incognito bank accounts private jets yachts mansions even artworks by Picasso Banksy and other masters – providing more information than what’s usually available to law enforcement agencies and cash-strapped governments.

People linked by the secret documents to offshore assets include India’s cricket superstar Sachin Tendulkar pop music diva Shakira supermodel Claudia Schiffer and an Italian mobster known as “Lell the Fat One.”

The mobster Raffaele Amato has been tied to at least a dozen killings. The documents provide details about a shell company registered in the United Kingdom that Amato used to buy land in Spain shortly before fleeing there from Italy to set up his own crime gang. Amato whose history helped inspire the highly praised movie “Gomorrah” is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

Amato’s attorney did not respond to ICIJ’s request for comment.

Tendulkar’s attorney said the cricket player’s investment is legitimate and has been declared to tax authorities. Shakira’s attorney said the singer declared her companies which the attorney said do not provide tax advantages. Schiffer’s representatives said the supermodel correctly pays her taxes in the U.K. where she lives.

In most countries it’s not illegal to have assets offshore or to use shell companies to do business across national borders. Businesspeople who operate internationally say they need offshore companies to conduct their financial affairs.

But these affairs often amount to shifting profits from high-tax countries where they are earned to companies that exist only on paper in low-tax jurisdictions. Using offshore shelters is especially controversial for political figures because they can be used to keep politically unpopular or even illicit activities from public view.

In popular imagination the offshore system is often seen as a far-flung cluster of palm-shaded islands. The Pandora Papers show that the offshore money machine operates in every corner of the planet including the world’s largest democracies. The key players in the system include elite institutions – multinational banks law firms and accounting practices – headquartered in the U.S. and Europe.

A document in the Pandora Papers shows that banks around the world helped their customers set up at least 3926 offshore companies with the assistance of Alemán Cordero Galindo & Lee a Panamanian law firm led by a former ambassador to the U.S. The document shows that the firm – also known as Alcogal – set up at least 312 companies in the British Virgin Islands for clients of the American financial services giant Morgan Stanley.

A Morgan Stanley spokesperson said: “We do not create offshore companies. . . . This process is independent of the firm and at the discretion and direction of the client.”

The Pandora Papers investigation also highlights how Baker McKenzie the largest law firm in the U.S. helped create the modern offshore system and continues to be a mainstay of this shadow economy.

Baker McKenzie and its global affiliates have used their lobbying and legislation-drafting know-how to shape financial laws around the world. They have also profited from work done for people tied to fraud and corruption reporting by ICIJ has found.

The people that the firm has done work for includes Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky who U.S. authorities allege laundered $5.5 billion through a tangle of shell companies purchasing factories and commercial properties across the U.S. heartland.

Baker McKenzie also did work for Jho Low a now-fugitive financier accused by authorities in multiple countries of masterminding the embezzlement of more than $4.5 billion from a Malaysian economic development fund known as 1MDB. ICIJ’s reporting found that Low relied on Baker McKenzie and its affiliates to help him and his associates build a web of companies in Malaysia and Hong Kong. U.S. authorities allege they used some of those companies to shift money looted from 1MDB.

A spokesperson for Baker McKenzie said the firm seeks to provide the best advice to its clients and strives “to ensure that our clients adhere to both the law and best practice.”

The spokesperson didn’t directly address many questions about Baker McKenzie’s role in the offshore economy citing client confidentiality and legal privilege. But he said the firm performs strict background checks on all potential clients.

‘You know who’

The Pandora Papers investigation is larger and more global than even ICIJ’s landmark Panama Papers investigation which rocked the world in 2016 spawning police raids and new laws in dozens of countries and the fall of prime ministers in Iceland and Pakistan.

The Panama Papers came from the files of a single offshore services provider: the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. The Pandora Papers shine a light on a far wider cross-section of the lawyers and middlemen who are at the heart of the offshore industry.

The Pandora Papers provide more than twice as much information about the ownership of offshore companies. In all the new leak of documents reveals the real owners of more than 29000 offshore companies. The owners come from more than 200 countries and territories with the largest contingents from Russia the U.K. Argentina and China.

The 150 news outlets that joined the investigative partnership include The Washington Post the BBC The Guardian Radio France Oštro Croatia the Indian Express Zimbabwe’s The Standard Morocco’s Le Desk and Ecuador’s Diario El Universo.

A global team was needed because the 14 offshore providers that are the sources of the leaked documents are headquartered around the globe from the Caribbean to the Persian Gulf to the South China Sea.

Three of the providers are owned by former senior government officials: a former government minister and presidential adviser in Panama and a former attorney general of Belize who controls two providers.

For a few hundred or a few thousand dollars offshore providers can help clients set up a company whose real owners remain hidden. Or for perhaps $2000 to $25000 they can set up a trust that in some instances allows its beneficiaries to control their money while embracing the legal fiction that they don’t control it – a bit of paper-shuffling creativity that helps shield assets from creditors law enforcement and ex-spouses.

Offshore operatives don’t work in isolation. They partner with other secrecy providers around the globe to create interlocking layers of companies and trusts. The more complex the arrangements the higher the fees – and the more secrecy and protection clients can expect.

The Pandora Papers show that an English accountant in Switzerland worked with lawyers in the British Virgin Islands to help Jordan’s monarch King Abdullah II secretly purchase 14 luxury homes worth more than $106 million in the U.S. and the U.K. The advisers helped him set up at least 36 shell companies from 1995 to 2017.

In 2017 the king bought a $23 million property overlooking a California surfing beach through a company in the BVI. The king paid extra to have another BVI company owned by his Swiss wealth managers act as the “nominee” director for the BVI company that bought the property.

In the offshore world nominee directors are people or companies paid to front for whoever is really behind a company. Application forms sent to clients by Alcogal the law firm working on the king’s behalf say that the use of nominee directors helps “preserve privacy by avoiding the identity of the ultimate principal . . . being publicly accessible.”

In emails offshore advisers used a code name for the king: “You know who.”

U.K. attorneys for the king said that he is not required to pay taxes under Jordanian law and that he has security and privacy reasons to hold property through offshore companies. They said the king has never misused public funds.

The attorneys also said that most of the companies and properties identified by ICIJ have no connection to the king or no longer exist but declined to provide details.

Experts say that as ruler of one of the Middle East’s poorest and most aid-dependent countries the king has reasons to avoid flaunting his wealth.

“If the Jordanian monarch were to display his wealth more publicly it wouldn’t only antagonize his people it would piss off Western donors who have given him money” Annelle Sheline an expert on political authority in the Middle East told ICIJ.

In neighboring Lebanon where similar questions about wealth and poverty have been playing out the Pandora Papers show top political and financial figures have also embraced offshore havens.

They include the current prime minister Najib Mikati and his predecessor Hassan Diab as well as Riad Salameh the governor of Lebanon’s central bank who is under investigation in France for alleged money laundering.

Marwan Kheireddine Lebanon’s former minister of state and the chairman of Al Mawarid Bank also appears in the secret files. In 2019 he scolded former parliamentary colleagues for inaction amid a dire economic crisis. Half the population was living in poverty struggling to find food as grocers and bakeries closed.

“There is tax evasion and the government needs to address that” Kheireddine said.

That same year the Pandora Papers reveal Kheireddine signed documents as owner of a BVI company that owns a $2 million yacht.

Al Mawarid Bank was one of many in the country that restricted customers’ U.S. dollar withdrawals to stem economic panic.

Wafaa Abou Hamdan a 57-year-old widow is among the regular Lebanese who remain angry at their country’s elites. Because of runaway inflation her life savings plummeted from the equivalent of $60000 to less than $5000 she told Daraj an ICIJ media partner.

“All my life’s efforts went in vain. I have been working continuously for the past three decades” she said. “We are still struggling on a daily basis to maintain our living” while “the politicians and the bankers” have “all transferred and invested their money abroad.”

Kheireddine and Diab did not respond to requests for comment. In a written response Salameh said he declares his assets and has complied with reporting obligations under Lebanese law. Mikati’s son Maher said it is common for people in Lebanon to use offshore companies “due to the easy process of incorporation” rather than a desire to evade taxes.

‘Coalition of the corrupt’

Imran Khan was elated when ICIJ’s Panama Papers investigation came out in April 2016.

“The leaks are God-sent” the Pakistani politician and former cricket superstar said.

The Panama Papers revealed that the children of Pakistan’s prime minister at the time Nawaz Sharif had ties to offshore companies. This gave Khan an opening to hammer Sharif his political rival on what Khan described as the “coalition of the corrupt” ravaging Pakistan.

“It is disgusting the way money is plundered in the developing world from people who are already deprived of basic amenities: health education justice and employment” Khan told ICIJ’s partner The Guardian in 2016. “This money is put into offshore accounts or even western countries western banks. The poor get poorer. Poor countries get poorer and rich countries get richer. Offshore accounts protect these crooks.”

Ultimately Pakistan’s top court removed Sharif from office as a result of an inquiry sparked by the Panama Papers. Khan swept in to replace him in the next national election.

ICIJ’s latest investigation the Pandora Papers brings renewed attention to the use of offshore companies by Pakistani political players. This time the offshore holdings of people close to Khan are being disclosed including his finance minister and a top financial backer.

The documents also show that Khan’s water resources minister Chaudhry Moonis Elahi contacted Asiaciti an Singapore-based offshore services provider in 2016 about setting up a trust to invest the profits from a family land deal that had been financed by what the lender later claimed was an illegal loan. The bank told Pakistani authorities that the loan had been approved due to the influence of Elahi’s father a former deputy prime minister.

Asiaciti records say that Elahi backed off from putting money into a trust in Singapore after the provider told him it would report the details to Pakistani tax authorities.

Elahi did not respond to ICIJ’s requests for comment. Hours before the release of Pandora Papers stories a family spokesman told ICIJ media partners that “misleading interpretations and data have been circulated in files for nefarious reasons.” The spokesman added that the family’s assets “are declared as per applicable law.”

Also today a spokesperson for Khan told a press conference that if any of his ministers or advisors had offshore companies “they will have to be held accountable.”

Other political figures have also spoken out against the offshore system while surrounded by appointees and other supporters who have assets stowed offshore. Some who have spoken out have used the system themselves.

“Every public servant’s assets must be declared publicly so that people can question and ask – what is legitimate?” Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta told the BBC in 2018. “If you can’t explain yourself including myself then I have a case to answer.”

The leaked records listed Kenyatta and his mother as beneficiaries of a secretive foundation in Panama. Other family members including his brother and two sisters own five offshore companies with assets worth more than $30 million the records show.

Kenyatta and his family did not reply to requests for comment.

Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis one of his country’s richest men rose to power promising to crack down on tax evasion and corruption. In 2011 as he became more involved in politics Babis told voters that he wanted to create a country “where entrepreneurs will do business and will be happy to pay taxes.”

The leaked records show that in 2009 Babis injected $22 million into a string of shell companies to buy a sprawling property known as Chateau Bigaud in a hilltop village in Mougins France near Cannes.

Babis has not disclosed the shell companies and the chateau in the asset declarations he’s required to file as a public official according to documents obtained by ICIJ’s Czech partner Investigace.cz. In 2018 a real estate conglomerate indirectly owned by Babis quietly bought the Monaco company that owned the chateau.

Babis didn’t respond to requests for comment.

A spokesman for the conglomerate told ICIJ that it complies with the law. He didn’t respond to questions about the acquisition of the chateau.

“Like any other business entity we have the right to protect our trade secrets” the spokesman wrote.

‘A haven of scams’

The secret files provide a layer of behind-the-curtain context to public pronouncements this year about wealth and offshore refuges — as governments around the world struggle with revenue crunches a pandemic climate change and public distrust.

In February a commentary from the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change urged policymakers to seek among other measures higher taxes on land and homes. Blair the institute’s founder and executive chairman talked about how the rich and well-connected shirk paying their share of taxes as far back as 1994 when he campaigned to become the leader of the U.K.’s Labour Party.

“For those who can employ the right accountants the tax system is a haven of scams perks … and profits” he said during a speech in England’s West Midlands. “We should not make our tax rules a playground for …. tax abusers who pay little or nothing while others pay more than their share.”

The Pandora Papers show that in 2017 Blair and his wife Cherie became the owners of a $8.8 million Victorian building by acquiring the British Virgin Islands company that held the property. The London building now hosts Cherie Blair’s law firm.

The records indicate that Cherie Blair and her husband who served as a diplomat in the Middle East after stepping down as prime minister in 2007 bought the offshore company that owned the building from the family of Bahrain’s industry and tourism minister Zayed bin Rashid al-Zayani.

By purchasing the company shares instead of the building the Blairs benefited from a legal arrangement that saved them from having to pay more than $400000 in property taxes.

The Blairs and the al-Zayanis said they didn’t initially know about each other’s involvement in the deal.

Cherie Blair said that her husband was not involved in the transaction and that its purpose was “bringing the company and the building back into the U.K. tax and regulatory regime.”

She also said that she “did not want to be the owner of a BVI company” and that the “seller for their own purposes only wanted to sell the company.” The company is now closed.

Through their lawyer the al-Zayanis said their companies “have complied with all U.K. laws past and present.”

“These are loopholes that are available to wealthy people but not available to others” Robert Palmer executive director of Tax Justice UK told The Guardian. “Politicians need to fix the tax system so that everyone pays their fair share.”

In June Brazil’s economics minister Paulo Guedes proposed a tax reform package that included a 30% tax on profits earned through offshore entities. Experts estimate that Brazil’s richest people hold almost $200 billion in untaxed funds outside the country.

“You cannot be ashamed of being rich” Guedes said. “You have to be ashamed of not paying taxes.”

After bankers and business leaders objected to tax hikes in the legislation Guedes a millionaire former banker agreed to remove the proposed tax on offshore profits. Negotiations over the legislation are continuing.

The Pandora Papers reveal that Guedes created Dreadnoughts International Group in 2014 in the British Virgin Islands.

In response to questions from an ICIJ partner in Brazil Revista Piauí a spokesperson for Guedes said the minister has disclosed the company to Brazilian authorities. The spokesperson did not answer a question about the removal of the offshore tax from the legislation.

‘Pandora’s box’

In December 2018 the Bahamas enacted legislation requiring companies and certain trusts to declare their real owners to a government registry. The island nation was under pressure from larger countries including the U.S. to do more to block tax dodgers and criminals from the financial system.

Some Bahamian politicians opposed the move. They complained the register would discourage Latin American clients from doing business in the Caribbean. “The winners of these new double standards are the U.S. states of Delaware Alaska and South Dakota” one local attorney said.

Months later a confidential document indicated that the family of the Dominican Republic’s former Vice President Carlos Morales Troncoso had abandoned the Bahamas as a go-to sanctuary for their wealth.

For their new refuge they chose a place 1600 miles away: Sioux Falls South Dakota.

The family set up South Dakota trusts leaked records show to lay away various assets including shares they’d held in a Dominican sugar company. The family did not respond to questions about the assets moved from the Bahamas to South Dakota.

The Pandora Papers provide details about tens of millions of dollars moved from offshore havens in the Caribbean and Europe into South Dakota a sparsely populated American state that has become a major destination for foreign assets.

Over the past decade South Dakota Nevada and more than a dozen other U.S. states have transformed themselves into leaders in the business of peddling financial secrecy. Meanwhile most of the policy and law enforcement efforts of the world’s most powerful nations have stayed focused on “traditional” offshore havens such as the Bahamas the Caymans and other island paradises.

The U.S. is one of the biggest players in the offshore world. It is also the country best situated to bring an end to offshore financial abuses thanks to the outsize role it plays in the international banking system. Because of the U.S. dollar’s status as the de facto global currency most international transactions flow in and out of New York-based banking operations.

U.S. authorities have taken action over the past two decades to force banks in Switzerland and other countries to turn over information about Americans with overseas accounts.

But the U.S. is more interested in forcing other countries to share information about Americans banking offshore than in sharing information about money moving through U.S. bank accounts companies and trusts.

The U.S. has refused to join a 2014 agreement supported by more than 100 jurisdictions including the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg that would require American financial institutions to share information they have about foreigners’ assets.

Year after year in South Dakota state lawmakers have approved legislation drafted by trust industry insiders providing more and more protections and other benefits for trust customers in the U.S. and abroad. Customer assets in South Dakota trusts have more than quadrupled over the past decade to $360 billion.

“As a citizen I’m so sad that my state was the state that opened Pandora’s box” Susan Wismer a former lawmaker told ICIJ.

By 2020 17 of the world’s 20 least-restrictive jurisdictions for trusts were American states according to a study by Israeli academic Adam Hofri-Winogradow. In many cases he said U.S. laws have made it more difficult for creditors to put their hands on what they are owed including child support payments from absent parents.

Using documents from the Pandora Papers ICIJ and The Washington Post identified nearly 30 U.S.-based trusts linked to foreigners personally accused of misconduct or whose companies were accused of wrongdoing.

Among them is Federico Kong Vielman whose family is one of Guatemala’s economic powerhouses.

In 2016 Kong Vielman moved $13.5 million into a trust in Sioux Falls. Some of the money came from his family’s company which makes floor waxes and other products.

Guatemalan media reported for decades on the family’s ties to politics. In the 1970s the family was identified as a key ally of Gen. Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio the former Guatemalan dictator known as the “Jackal of Zacapa.” In 2016 the family’s luxury hotel in Guatemala City made a gift of 100 free nights to then-President Jimmy Morales. Guatemalan media outlets reported that a possible payment for “political favors” was suspected.

In 2014 U.S. labor officials filed a complaint against Guatemala’s government that included allegations that the family’s palm oil company underpaid workers and exposed them to toxic chemicals. Company records show Kong Vielman was previously the company’s treasurer.

A year later U.S. environmental authorities providing technical assistance to Guatemala found that the company released pollutants into the Pasion River. The family company Nacional Agro Industrial SA known as Naisa was not charged.

Naisa told ICIJ that it followed the law and did not pollute the river. The labor complaint was resolved by an arbitration panel the company said.

Kong Vielman declined to respond to questions about the South Dakota trust.

Another wealthy Latin American who set up trusts in South Dakota is Guillermo Lasso a banker who was elected as Ecuador’s president in April. Leaked records show that Lasso moved assets into two trusts in South Dakota in December 2017 three months after Ecuador’s parliament passed a law prohibiting public officials from holding assets in tax havens. The records show that Lasso moved two offshore companies to the South Dakota trusts from two secretive foundations in Panama.

Lasso said that his past use of offshore entities was “legal and legitimate.” Lasso said he complies with Ecuadorian law.

Trusts set up in South Dakota and many other U.S. states remain cloaked in secrecy despite enactment this year of the federal Corporate Transparency Act which makes it harder for owners of certain types of companies to hide their identities.

The law is not expected to apply to trusts popular with non-U.S. citizens. Another glaring exemption financial crime experts say is that many lawyers who set up trusts and shell companies have no obligations to examine the sources of their clients’ wealth.

“Clearly the U.S. is a big big loophole in the world” said Yehuda Shaffer former head of the Israeli financial intelligence unit. “The U.S. is criticizing all the rest of the world but in their own backyard this is a very very serious issue.”

‘Extraordinary expenses’

Billionaire Erman Ilicak’s construction empire had a big year in 2014.

The Turkish mogul’s company Rönesans Holding finished building a 1150-room presidential palace for his country’s pugnacious leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan amid media rumblings about cost overruns and corruption and a court order attempting to stop the project.

Another notable event involving the Ilicak family took place in 2014 this time out of the public glare. The corporate titan’s 74-year-old mother Ayse Ilicak became the owner of two offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands according to the Pandora Papers.

Both companies were fronted by nominee directors and nominee shareholders. One of the companies Covar Trading Ltd. held assets from the family’s construction conglomerate the records say. During its first full year in operation Covar Trading earned $105.5 million in income from dividends according to confidential financial statements. The money was stashed in a Swiss account.

It didn’t stay long.

That same year the statements show the company paid almost the entire $105.5 million as a “donation” listed under “extraordinary expenses.” The statements do not describe who or what received the money.

Illiack did not reply to questions for this story.

Ilicak and the other billionaires in the Pandora Papers come from 45 countries with the largest number from Russia (52) Brazil (15) the U.K. (13) and Israel (10).

The American billionaires mentioned in the secret documents include two tech moguls Robert F. Smith and Robert T. Brockman whose trusts have been the targets of investigations by U.S. authorities. Both were clients of CILTrust an offshore provider in Belize operated by Glenn Godfrey a former attorney general of Belize.

Smith agreed last year to pay U.S. authorities $139 million to settle a tax probe and is cooperating with prosecutors. A U.S. grand jury indicted Brockman Smith’s mentor and financial backer in what prosecutors called the biggest tax fraud in U.S. history.

Smith declined to comment. Brockman has pleaded not guilty.

Neither CILTrust nor Godfrey have been accused of wrongdoing. Godfrey did not respond to requests for comment.

A law firm in Cyprus Nicos Chr. Anastasiades and Partners appears in the Pandora Papers as a key offshore go-between for wealthy Russians. The firm retains the name of its founder Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades and the president’s two daughters are partners there.

The records show that in 2015 a compliance manager at the Panama law firm Alcogal found that the Cypriot law firm helped a Russian billionaire and former senator Leonid Lebedev conceal ownership of four companies by listing law firm employees as owners of Lebedev’s entities.

Lebedev – an oil tycoon and movie producer with Hollywood connections – fled Russia in 2016 after authorities accused him of embezzling $220 million from an energy company. Lebedev did not respond to requests for comment. The status of the Russian case is unclear.

The Cypriot law firm also prepared reference letters for Russian steel magnate Alexander Abramov including one drafted days after the U.S. added the billionaire’s name to the list of oligarchs close to President Putin. Abramov didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Theophanis Philippou the law firm’s managing director told the BBC an ICIJ partner that it has never misled authorities or concealed the identity of a company owner. He declined to comment on clients citing attorney-client confidentiality.

Another Russian in the Pandora Papers who has ties to Putin is Konstantin Ernst a television executive and Oscar-nominated producer. He has been called Putin’s top image-maker a creative talent who sold the nation on the idea that the president is “Russia’s strong-willed savior.”

The Pandora Papers reveal that Ernst was given a chance to participate in a lucrative opportunity soon after producing the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics at Sochi creating a spectacle that boosted Putin’s reputation inside and outside the country.

Ernst became a silent partner hidden behind layers of offshore companies in a state-funded privatization contract – a deal to buy dozens of movie theaters and other property from the city of Moscow.

The leaked records show that by 2019 the value of Ernst’s personal stake in the property holdings topped $140 million.

Ernst told ICIJ that he has “never made a secret” of his involvement in the privatization deal and that the deal was not compensation for his work during the 2014 Olympics.

“I haven’t committed any illegal actions” he said. “Nor am I committing any now or about to. This is how my parents raised me.”

‘Our way of life’

As a human rights and anti-poverty activist Mae Buenaventura joined the fight to secure the return of billions of dollars the late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos his family and cronies concealed in Swiss accounts and other hard-to-trace locations.

Many in her home country Buenaventura said “know that the wealthy have ways and means to accumulate riches and also hide them in a way that ordinary people cannot get their hands on.”

The Marcos scandal also educated the world encouraging stepped-up efforts to discover illicit money and punish the people who hide it.

Over the last 20 years political leaders have vowed to “eradicate” tax havens. They’ve called shell companies and money laundering “threats to our security our democracy and our way of life.” They’ve passed new laws and inked international agreements.

But the offshore system is nothing if not adaptable and cross-border financial crime and tax dodging continue to thrive.

When an offshore provider or jurisdiction is exposed by a leak or comes under pressure from authorities others use its misfortune as a marketing opportunity snapping up clients fleeing for safer havens.

An ICIJ analysis identified hundreds of offshore companies that ended relationships with the scandal-tarred law firm Mossack Fonseca after the release of the Panama Papers investigation. Other providers took over as the companies’ offshore agents.

Leak to us

One of those companies was controlled by an offshore trust whose beneficiaries included the wife of Jacob Rees-Mogg a member of the British Conservative Party and current leader of the House of Commons.

The Pandora Papers indicate that a holding company and a trust benefiting his spouse Helena de Chair owned “pictures and paintings” worth $3.5 million.

Another company that moved away from Mossack Fonseca was a BVI entity controlled by the widow and two sons of Indian underworld figure Iqbal Memon. Memon has been identified in news reports as a major drug dealer with links to terrorists. His widow and sons are accused of laundering drug money and have been wanted since 2019 by authorities in New Delhi.

In the Philippines money being moved around in the shadows continues to be a problem despite the attention given to Marcos’ offshore loot. In recent years the U.S. has labeled the Philippines as a “major money laundering jurisdiction.”

Philippine political figures in the Pandora Papers include Juan Andres Donato Bautista. He served from 2010 to 2015 as the chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government – the panel established to track down Marcos’ billions.

A month after he was appointed to lead the commission Bautista created a shell company in the British Virgin Island that held a bank account in Singapore secret records show.

Bautista was later tapped to head the country’s election agency but lawmakers impeached him in 2017 after his wife claimed he’d hoarded millions of dollars in undeclared domestic and foreign accounts.

In a phone call and emails to ICIJ Bautista said he created his BVI company on the advice of bankers. The bank account was opened before he joined the government he said adding that it never received significant deposits and that he disclosed his interests to authorities. He denied wrongdoing and said there are no formal charges against him.

Despite failures by the Philippines and other nations to curb the flow of covert money Buenaventura and other reform advocates say there are reasons for hope.

Street protesters helped topple top leaders in Iceland and Pakistan after the Panama Papers. The Philippines has joined dozens of countries that now require companies to disclose their real owners. Philippine authorities have recovered roughly $4 billion stolen by Marcos and his circle using it to buy land for landless farmers and to compensate families of people targeted for murder or “enforced disappearance” by the Marcos regime.

Many obstacles remain. Big banks law firms and other powerful groups often oppose stronger transparency rules and tougher enforcement against offshore abuses. And in the Philippines and many other countries anti-corruption activists endure legal threats arrests and violence.

Last month police fired water cannons at protesters who marked the 49th anniversary of Marcos’ declaration of martial law by drawing attention to similarities with current President Rodrigo Duterte’s rule.

Buenaventura said she and other grass-roots activists will keep working to expose wealth that’s “deeply hidden.”

“Our slogan is: The truth will come out.”

Correction: Alexander Abramov was named in a U.S. congressional report submitted under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017. An earlier version of this story erroneously stated that Abramov was sanctioned.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvaXNlc3RhdGUuZWR1L2dpdmluZy8yMDIxLzEwLzAzL2NyaW1zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For John Crim Giving is a Way of Life - Giving,"A retired accountant John Crim often sees things through the lens of their return on investment.

Ask him what makes Boise State University a good investment and he’ll say it’s the pleasure of seeing its progress and maturing into excellence. “I’ve watched Boise State grow from a junior college” he said. “We’re seeing what Boise State can do for Idaho and it’s exciting.”

Crim has done more than watch. Over 30 years he has helped bring more than $1 million in gifts to Boise State — his first priority being the Crim Family Memorial Nursing Scholarship — though he has also given to the Accounting Endowment Scholarship the Cecil D. Andrus Chair for Environment and Public Lands and elsewhere.

His professional life has been just as varied and he worked stints at firms like Moss Adams (CPAs) Ore-Ida Foods and finally Idaho First National/West One Bank (now U.S. Bank). He brought his no-nonsense business approach to recruiting some of the finest minds in Boise banking and finance as donors and advisors to the university.

His deepest investment is in the nursing program. “Sharon my first wife and a Boise State nursing graduate was diagnosed with ovarian cancer three days after I retired in 1994” he said. Ten months later “she was gone.” Before her death however Sharon agreed with her husband that the money they would have spent on their retirement trip abroad would become the base gift to endow the Crim Family Memorial Nursing Scholarship which fully funds the tuition and fees of single parents going through nursing school. Sharon had been a non-traditional student herself earning her nursing degree after one of their sons Mike was in medical school.

Giving back has been part of John’s life since the beginning. He has served on and chaired multiple boards shaping the region’s health education and recreation. In addition to the Friends of Nursing and Accounting Department Advisory boards at Boise State his service included the Downtown Boise Rotary Club Family Medicine Residency of Idaho and Bogus Basin Recreation Association. It was through the Bogus Basin Prime Timers (skiers 50 years or older) that friends introduced him to his current wife Diane. “When I met a woman that could out-ski me I knew she was special” he said.

Over the past 24 years Diane has joined John in his philanthropy to help non-traditional students achieve their dream of becoming registered nurses and graduates of Boise State. “When I hear these students’ stories they just blow you away with what they are juggling — family work class training in the hospitals” she said “I appreciate them and all it takes to reach graduation.”

Since establishing the scholarship the Crims have continued to put money into the fund and in typical fashion enlist others in giving too. Also in keeping with John’s habits is the pleasure he gets in seeing the often dramatic change scholarships have on the lives of their recipients.

“The highlight of my life is to go to a scholarship dinner with Diane and have one or two of the scholars suddenly realize they’re doubling their income when they become a nurse” he said.

The scholarship is a window into the mind and motivations of a man who has given significant energy and money to Boise State. “We’re motivated to help Idaho’s non-traditional students to be knowledgeable nurses and have exposure to all types of nursing careers from patient care to leadership” John said. “Nurses are an excellent investment.”

Five Jewish settlers among them two juveniles were detained by Israeli police after an attack on a Palestinian village in the West Bank.

The assault the latest in what human rights groups say is a constant pattern of aggressive acts by settlers in the Masafer Yatta area southeast of Hebron has drawn condemnation from the United States and the European Union as well as Israel’s foreign minister Yair Lapid.

Mohammed Hussein Hamamdeh from the village of Al Mufaqarah told CNN the incident began when dozens of settlers from the nearby settler outpost of Avigail descended on the village on Tuesday afternoon throwing rocks and attacking villagers livestock and property.

Hamamdeh’s four-year old grandson was hit by a rock in the attack and was taken to an Israeli hospital to be treated for head injuries he said.

Video distributed by Israeli human rights group B’Tselem – which used the word pogrom to describe the events – showed masked men rampaging through the small farming community attacking cars and buildings.

It also showed Israeli soldiers apparently failing to intervene and in one case throwing things at a person filming the incident.

Asked to comment on Tuesday’s events the Israeli army told CNN the commander responsible for the West Bank Major General Yehuda Fox had visited the village the following day quoting Fox saying the army is “committed to the security of all the residents in the area.”

The army also released a video showing soldiers in a verbal altercation with a settler.

Lapid condemned the settlers’ actions calling it terror.

“This isn’t the Israeli way and it isn’t the Jewish way. This is a violent and dangerous fringe and we have a responsibility to bring them to justice” he tweeted.

Lapid’s statement cleared the way for the US State Department to follow suit with condemnation of its own.

“The U.S. government strongly condemns the acts of settler violence that took place against Palestinians in villages near Hebron in the West Bank on September 28. We appreciate the Foreign Minister and other officials’ strong and unequivocal condemnations of this violence” a US Embassy spokesperson said.

The European Union added its condemnation and said the perpetrators needed to be prosecuted.

But human rights groups say settlers suspected of violence against Palestinians are rarely arrested or detained and by Friday evening up to four of the five detained in connection with Tuesday’s attack had been released per Israeli media reports.

According to another human rights group Breaking the Silence while incidents like the one on Tuesday represent one of the worst acts of settler violence in the area for years other types of intimidation against local Palestinians like stealing goats and sheep polluting water cisterns and attacking children on their way to school are an almost daily occurrence.

Mohammed Hamamdeh told CNN he remained defiant.

“They simply want us all off our lands but they will only see this in their dreams. They think that if they break our properties and our houses and if they beat us that they will break our resistance and our dignity. But we are here and we are staying here until the last drop of blood” he said.

Uber Eats announced last week that it was offering special deliveries made by retro cars in celebration of KFC’s new Zinger Popcorn Bucket for a limited time. Customers in London who order the new meal deal on the Uber Eats app by October 4 may receive a visit from the Batmobile the ”Ghostbusters” Echto-1 or James Bond’s Aston Martin DB5 — considered by Brits to be the ultimate movie car.

The food delivery service surveyed a representative sample of 2000 U.K. adults last month to uncover the greatest cars to feature in films with the Aston Martin DB5 taking the top spot followed by the 1981 DeLorean DMC-12 from the “Back to the Future” trilogy Chitty Chitty Bang Bang from the eponymous movie among other classic cars.

Right after the Sweptail was revealed Rolls-Royce had a number of clients asking for custom vehicles of their own leading the company to create a full-on coachbuilding division of the brand. Three particular customers had very similar visions of what they wanted and after four years of development the new Boat Tail was born.

Three Boat Tails will be built one for each of said customers and each one will have its own unique styling elements color and trim specs and special features. So far only one car has been built -- the blue one you see here -- and Rolls-Royce isn't ready to talk about the other two yet. That's fine because this first one is absolutely spectacular.

Following its initial debut in May the Rolls-Royce Boat Tail made its public debut at Italy's Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este this weekend. And even here among a sea of ultra-rare high-dollar vehicles the Boat Tail made an absolute splash.

The design

While the Sweptail was constrained by the old Phantom's platform which has roots back in the 20th century the Boat Tail is based on Rolls-Royce's own Architecture of Luxury a modular platform that underpins the current Phantom Cullinan and Ghost and crucially doesn't share anything with BMW . This means that Rolls-Royce's designers can create basically anything they want without any engineering compromises and the AoL platform is designed to support full electrification in the future. Rolls-Royce isn't talking full specs yet but we know this model shares the same twin-turbo V12 as the rest of the Rolls lineup. There's no word as to whether it has rear-wheel steering or all-wheel drive both of which the AoL platform can provide.

Immediately the Boat Tail looks special and unlike any other modern Rolls-Royce -- Head of Coachbuild Design Alex Innes says the car is ""a moment in my career that will probably never be repeated."" At nearly 228 inches long it's almost 2 feet longer than the Dawn  and it's even longer than the old Phantom Drophead. True to its name the design has incredible proportions inspired by prewar boat-tail cars (including some coachbuilt Rolls-Royces) with a sweeping rear end that pinches in the farther back you get. It's a fantastic interpretation of the boat-tail rear end without being at all retro or kitschy.

The entirety of the Boat Tail is hand-built. Body surfacing is minimal with one prominent crease that runs from the leading edge of the front fender all the way to the taillights and a second lower rising line that connects to the wheel arches. A strip of chrome encircles the entire car just underneath that lower crease rising up at the rear of the car and all the lower body parts underneath are made from exposed carbon fiber.

Compared with Rolls' current production cars the Boat Tail's face looks unique. The Pantheon grille is an integral part of the front end instead of looking more tacked-on; there's no chrome surround just chrome slats inset in the recessed opening. The top of the grille is a smooth curve that flows into the hood and the latter has a subtle crease down the center and minimal lines otherwise.

A long chrome strip runs across the front end topping the grille and the higher-up slim set of LED headlamps. Underneath those lights are a round recessed lamp on each end a throwback to the previous-gen Phantom. These lights were desired by the customers and they give the front a more classic look. The front end is otherwise unadorned save for a horizontal grille opening and some character lines that surround the headlights. The rear end has a similar full-width chrome strip above superslim horizontal LED taillights that integrates the Rolls-Royce badge.

Enlarge Image The fixed roof is removable but there's no traditional soft top. Rolls-Royce

I especially love the windshield which appears to have fully wraparound glass that ends at the slightly swept-back chrome A-pillars. But really it's three pieces of glass with small quarter windows that are glazed over additional upright pillars. The Boat Tail has regular retractable side windows as well as a set of smaller quarter windows.

While Rolls-Royce says its customers didn't specifically ask for a roof -- and the Boat Tail was designed without one in mind -- the company has also developed a fixed roof for the car. The top features a glass rear window and two upright posts made from carbon fiber while the main top section is fabric and has extensions that clamp onto the deck and give it a flying buttress look. This roof requires multiple people to attach and remove but the car also comes with a tonneau cover in case of emergencies or when the car will be left parked outside without access to the roof.

One of this Boat Tail's individual features is the color. The client's favorite color is blue and the specific name of the hue is the couple's last name so the company is just calling it ""Blue"" to protect their anonymity. In a first for a production Rolls-Royce the Boat Tail's hood has a gradient effect with the leading edge of the hood having a dark blue finish that fades into the rest of the body's hue as it reaches the windshield. Rolls-Royce says the gradient on the hood was hand-painted with the panel pinned on the wall like an easel and sprayed in a single pass. This is so the bodywork wouldn't have a perfect finish as the client didn't like the look of the fully perfected final versions when presented with early paint samples. The design of the 21-inch wheels is also specific to this car and they're finished in the dark blue with matching light blue inserts accented by the pinstriped tires.

The hosting suite

The entire rear deck is made from open-pore dark-gray Caleidolegno wood accented by stainless-steel stripes that are reminiscent of a boat's hull. This wood is typically only used in interiors but Rolls-Royce was able to adapt it for use on the exterior and its striping and grain are perfectly matched to the lines of the car. The wood and steel accents are also found on the top surface of the rear bumper.

This Boat Tail's centerpiece is underneath that glorious rear deck. The owners are a couple who love hosting dinner parties so at the press of a button the deck opens into a ""hosting suite"" ideal for the world's fanciest picnics. Rolls' Innes calls it an ""engineering marvel"" adding that it gives the car a major sense of occasion. Hinged at the center the two lockable panels open in a butterfly motion at a 67-degree angle. The undersides of the panels are covered in chrome while the intricate interior cabinets are made from carbon.

With the panels open two chests present themselves at a 15-degree angle. On the right side is a full set of dishes and silverware and on the left are a double refrigerator a set of Champagne glasses napkins and other essentials for enjoying bubbly. The owners are Champagne enthusiasts -- relatable -- so the Boat Tail comes with their favorite vintage of Armand de Brignac. Naturally the bottles are custom-fitted to the hosting suite's housings and are polished and finished in matching blue tones. The fridge is even set to the optimum serving temperature of this specific Champagne. Everything found in the suite is custom-made and engraved and Rolls-Royce says there are no spares. If anything gets broken Rolls will have to make new ones.

There's a cocktail table on each side that's finished in matching wood and rotates in a way that mimics ""the offering of an attendant"" and a pair of folding stools made from leather and carbon-fiber stows below them. Once the two panels are open a parasol(!) hidden in the center of the rear deck can be deployed. Designed by Rolls-Royce from the ground up the parasol features carbon-fiber stays and a polished aluminum telescoping assembly. The whole thing opens in a flowering inverted motion so you can be standing right up against the car and not get in the way.

The interior

Curiously the Boat Tail seems to completely share its dashboard center console steering wheel seats and door panels with the old Phantom Drophead convertible not the new-gen Phantom with which the Boat Tail shares its modular platform. In fact it seems like the only major styling differences are the deck and surround for the rear seats.

I think I know why though: The couple who ordered this Boat Tail are also timepiece aficionados and the car comes with a pair of special Bovet 1822 watches -- one of the husband and one for the wife. Naturally these pieces are also complete one-offs that match the car. These watches have been designed so that they can be placed in a titanium cradle in the Boat Tail's fascia to serve as the clock while the car is being driven and there's a special compartment to stow the watch's removable straps.

Enlarge Image This image is our best look at the interior so far. Rolls-Royce

The new Phantom has a fixed clock in the top of the dashboard next to the infotainment screen but the old Phantom had a screen that could be hidden by a rotating panel that contained a dashboard clock. While we don't have all the details yet -- expect a story specifically on this Boat Tail's watch in the coming weeks -- the timepiece is housed in that panel. The car also has analog gauges that mimic the watch's face instead of digital gauges like the newer production cars.

Aside from the wristwatch and despite using some old components the Boat Tail's interior still looks awesome thanks to a number of additional special touches. The cabin's two-tone blue color scheme matches the exterior paint with the front seats a dark blue and the rear a light blue. There's bright blue contrast stitching and piping the leather has a metallic sheen to it and the lower carbon-fiber parts in the interior have a bright blue weave at 55 degrees to echo the waves of a boat's wake.

Most of the dash is covered in Caleidolegno wood to match the deck and veneers can be found on the center console transmission tunnel floor and other parts of the interior. The couple also owns a classic 1932 Rolls-Royce Boat Tail that the wife wanted restored alongside the build of the modern car. Illustrations of both are found on stainless-steel caps at the ends of each armrest something you have to notice and pass by whenever you enter or exit. Innes describes being inside the car as being like sitting in the hull of a boat.

The Coachbuild process

As I mentioned earlier the unveiling of the Sweptail spurred many customers to approach Rolls-Royce wanting a coachbuilt car but three specific clients -- all couples or families -- shared a love of J-class racing yachts and nautical design. Rolls' designers have always wanted to create a modern Boat Tail especially as the brand has a long history with that body style so the three customers were presented with the idea and Rolls says they all immediately approved. Their only request to the designers? ""Show me something that I have never seen before.""

Enlarge Image The other two Boat Tails will have different styling and features. Gudrun Muschalla/Hardy Mutschler/BMW Group

The three clients don't know each other nor did they get in contact during the design and creation process. To retain the coachbuilt feel despite the models being part of a small series the customers agreed that the cars could share the same basic body. These clients weren't allowed to participate in the actual design process but they were involved the creative process and obviously guided the direction of each of their cars. In fact Rolls' design team traveled to each of their houses to learn more about these owners' lives personalities and desired use for their cars.

As you might expect the Boat Tail is full of firsts and superlatives. According to Innes the development time was quadrupled for this project and a 100-meter superyacht would be quicker to build; 1813 new parts were developed just for the Boat Tail and Rolls-Royce says this car is the result of 20 collective years of design and engineering. Just the development and reconfiguration of the body-in-white and aluminum spaceframe took eight months. In addition to myriad sketches and digital renderings the designers actually developed a full-size clay model of the car. Innes says the lengths the designers went to were no different than for a full production car.

One bonus of employing AoL architecture is that Rolls' designers didn't need to adhere to existing body mounting points so the only real body seam or cutline on the car is for the doors. And because the entirety of the car is hand-built and the designers were involved through the whole metalworking phase they were able to achieve surfacing and details you can't get through traditional pressing techniques. The Boat Tail's front fenders have the single largest square meterage of unbroken form that Rolls-Royce has ever put on a car as they also contain the integrated bumpers and much of the side panels. Similarly the UK automaker says those wood panels on the deck are the largest pieces of wood ever to have been applied to a car.

The 15-speaker bespoke audio system in all of Rolls' production cars uses a section of the sill as the resonance chambers for the bass speakers but in the Boat Tail the whole of the floor structure is used. Five new ECUs were created just for the rear end of the car to make sure the hosting suite was possible which also required a dedicated wiring harness that took nine months of development. The hosting suite has its own climate-control system in the compartments to preserve food and two fans are mounted in the lower section in case of hot weather -- Rolls even says the hosting suite was tested between 176 degrees and -4 degrees Fahrenheit to make sure the system could work in all climates.

Innes is proud of the fact that all three Boat Tails have been commissioned by people who promise to genuinely regularly drive and use their cars -- hence the hosting suite in this one -- and all three customers want to drive the car as soon as they take delivery. These original coachbuilt wonders aren't just going to be hidden away in a garage never to be seen. To that end the Boat Tail is fully homologated and road-legal having gone through the same dynamic testing regimen as any regular production Rolls. The owner will even be able to have the vehicle serviced at regular Rolls-Royce dealerships. As with the stuff in the hosting suite though Rolls has no spare parts.

Rolls-Royce won't say anything about how much money the Boat Tail costs. At the time the Sweptail was first shown it was the most expensive new car of all time with an alleged price of just under $13 million an amount that was surpassed in 2019 by the $18.7M Bugatti La Voiture Noire. With development costs of the Boat Tail split across three cars that should keep the price down a little -- my best guess is that each one is setting back the owners around $10 million. Are you a billionaire and you're looking at these photos wondering if you can order a Boat Tail for yourself? Don't bother calling your dealer representative because you can't. Rolls-Royce says that the car is ""not a product offering.""

The company also isn't ready to share when the other two Boat Tails will come out but both models will be detailed as well as this first one has been once they're ready. As for other coachbuilt projects? With the launch of the new division we're certain to start seeing more incredible one-off creations in the near future. The next ones are already in the works in fact. We can't wait to see them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL25ld3MvMzc3OTQ2OC90ZWFjaGVyLXNsZWVwcy1oYW1tZXItdWJlci1kcml2ZXItc3RhbGtlci_SAVNodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS9uZXdzLzM3Nzk0NjgvdGVhY2hlci1zbGVlcHMtaGFtbWVyLXViZXItZHJpdmVyLXN0YWxrZXIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teacher 25 sleeps with hammer next to her bed after Uber driver shows up at her house TWICE without her...,"UBER CREEP Teacher 25 sleeps with hammer next to her bed after Uber driver shows up at her house TWICE without her ordering taxi

A TERRIFIED teaching assistant has been sleeping with a hammer next to her bed after an Uber driver showed up at her house twice without her ordering a taxi.

Amélé Sossavi 25 first met the driver when she ordered an Uber to move some suitcases from her old home to a new one on September 20.

3 The Uber driver posted a note through Amélé's letterbox Credit: Twitter

She said she exchanged small talk with him during the journey but it soon turned uncomfortable Metro.co.uk reports.

The driver asked her if she had a boyfriend and demanded her phone number once he dropped her off at the new address in south London.

Amélé tried to deflect his advances by giving out a fake number but two days later she found a note posted through her letterbox.

It said: ""Hey it’s Habib your number didn’t work. Call me on…"" followed by his contact details.

Despite being alarmed Amélé who works near where primary school teacher Sabina Nessa was murdered decided to ignore the driver’s note.

But while she was at work on Wednesday she received a text from one of her flatmates which said: ""Amélé your Uber driver just came to the house.""

When I eventually went back I had to lock all the doors and I have been sleeping with a hammer next to my bed as he now knows my address he knows where I live. Amélé Sossavi

Amélé told Metro: ""When my flatmate told me I just broke down. I work at a school and was on my lunch break when I found out and a couple of my colleagues had to calm me down.

""Especially with everything that has been happening to women recently this really freaked me out.""

She added: ""I did not even stay at home that night as I did not feel safe.

""When I eventually went back I had to lock all the doors and I have been sleeping with a hammer next to my bed as he now knows my address he knows where I live.""

Terrified Amélé called the police and told them she was worried she was being harassed and stalked and asked for an officer to meet her at the school.

She said the male officer initially ""did not understand the urgency of the situation"" and told her they did not have enough officers.

After ""fighting"" to get the police to help her a female officer went to the school and escorted Amélé home.

Later that day Amélé was told by police that the driver was fired by the taxi company.

Amélé added that she had a ""very positive"" experience with the police but she pointed out it was because female officers were on her case.

The young woman also contacted Uber to tell them she received an alarming note from the driver however she said they did not respond until after his second visit.

Speaking about how the incident has affected her life Amélé said: ‘I am back at my house now but I just feel sick.

""I do not feel safe and I do not think I will feel safer any time soon. I am going to start taking martial arts and self-defence classes because I just keep worrying.

""I will also never take an Uber ever again. I actually enjoyed speaking with taxi drivers but this has made me become anti-social as it seems that having a conversation and being friendly to someone makes them think much more.""

A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police confirmed they received a report of harassment and stalking on Wednesday.

They said: ""It was reported a woman had been harassed and repeatedly contacted by a private hire driver.

""An appointment was made to speak to the woman later the same day. The private hire driver was identified and spoken to and words of advice were issued.""

An Uber spokeswoman said: ""What has been described is totally unacceptable and we have a zero tolerance policy on any such behaviour in the Uber community.

""We are currently investigating this incident and anyone found to have behaved in this manner faces permanent removal from the app.""

The deal gives San Francisco-based Aurora a clearer path to profitability as it competes with Alphabet Inc's Waymo General Motors Co's majority-owned Cruise and Argo AI whose principal investors are Ford Motor Co and Volkswagen AG.

Toyota Sienna minivans will be equipped with Aurora's self-driving system with a test fleet to be deployed by the end of 2021. The plan is to deploy the vehicles some time after that in Uber Technologies' ride-hailing fleet and those of unspecified other companies.

In December Aurora said it was buying Uber's self-driving unit the Advanced Technologies Group (Uber ATG) in a deal valued at US$4 billion (RM16.2 billion) well below ATG's earlier valuation of US$7.25 billion.

Toyota and Denso were investors in Uber ATG along with Japan's SoftBank Group. Toyota was working with Uber ATG to develop a self-driving system to be deployed on the Sienna according to ATG executives.

Aurora's new agreement with Toyota and Denso expands on the earlier collaboration between the two Japanese companies and Uber ATG. Toyota remains an investor in Uber and transferred its equity stake from ATG to Aurora as part of the December transaction according to a source familiar with the deal.

As part of the December transaction involving ATG Uber agreed to invest US$400 million in Aurora in a deal that values Aurora at US$10 billion. The two companies agreed to collaborate on self-driving vehicles for Uber's ride hailing and food delivery networks.

Aurora said it will explore with Denso the mass production of self-driving components and with Toyota the development of mobility services including financing insurance and maintenance.

Aurora also has a deal with heavy-truck maker PACCAR to develop self-driving systems for long-haul freight delivery.

Earlier Aurora had development pacts with Volkswagen and Hyundai Motor. VW eventually bought a significant stake in Argo while Hyundai formed a joint venture called Motional with supplier Aptiv to develop self-driving vehicles for robotaxi fleets. – Reuters",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiugFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ib2xseXdvb2RsaWZlLmNvbS9ob2xseXdvb2QvbGF0ZXN0LWVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtbmV3cy1idHMta2ltLXRhZS1oeXVuZy1ha2EtdnMtdWJlci1jb29sLWxvb2tzLWF0LWZhY3QtbXVzaWMtYXdhcmRzLTIwMjEtbGVhdmUtZmFucy1oaWdobHktaW1wcmVzc2VkLWFybXktdmlldy10d2VldHMtMTkyNDY3Mi_SAb4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYm9sbHl3b29kbGlmZS5jb20vaG9sbHl3b29kL2xhdGVzdC1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LW5ld3MtYnRzLWtpbS10YWUtaHl1bmctYWthLXZzLXViZXItY29vbC1sb29rcy1hdC1mYWN0LW11c2ljLWF3YXJkcy0yMDIxLWxlYXZlLWZhbnMtaGlnaGx5LWltcHJlc3NlZC1hcm15LXZpZXctdHdlZXRzLTE5MjQ2NzIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BTS' Kim Tae-hyung aka V's uber-cool looks at Fact Music Awards 2021 leave fans highly impressed – view twee,"Fact Music Awards 2021 took place recently and K-pop band BTS won in five categories.

Jessica Alba shares her fall skincare routine revealing her staple beauty products that keep her skin hydrated.

Her favorites include the and the .

Alba says “Hydration is where it’s at when it comes to my skincare routine” per an interview with E! Entertainment.

As we think back to the good old days of the Fantastic Four series our love for one of the main characters stays strong. Jessica Alba’s role as Susan skyrocketed her to fame and now she’s busy working as an entrepreneur mother of three and social media content creator.

Judging by her slew of beauty videos on TikTok (and 7.5 million following on the platform!) it’s no surprise that the 40-year-old actress has made quite the name for herself in the skincare world. Her brand  quickly gained traction for its clean ingredients and amazing product reviews. And it offers up a bit of everything—from award-winning mascaras to top-rated eye creams.

So it's no surprise that the Honest Beauty founder turns to her line of products for fall. “Hydration is where it’s at when it comes to my skincare routine” Alba said during a recent interview with E! Entertainment.

The star shared details of her fall skincare routine including the moisturizer and tinted eye cream she can't live without.



She uses a lightweight moisturizer as a base

“In the fall my skin tends to be on the drier side so I love to use as a base.”

This gentle moisturizer is designed for sensitive skin and works to hydrate and strengthen the skin’s barrier. It’s formulated with a unique Phyto-Blend Liquid Crystal technology which helps create a moisture seal over the face.



It also includes micro hyaluronic acid ingredients which penetrate the skin deeply to hydrate it from the inside and out. The formula has a silky soft texture that’s super lightweight and it gets absorbed into the skin as soon you smooth it on. After moisturizing your face your skin will feel soft and look plumper. It also received a 4.4-star rating and hundreds of rave reviews from Amazon customers.

The eye-cream she loves helps neutralize dark circles

Another fall skincare essential Alba loves? . “This is another must-have product for me” said Alba. “If I don’t have enough time to do a five-minute face I’ll use this which doubles as an eye cream while it helps neutralize dark circles.”

What makes this product so different from other eye creams is incredibly nutrient-rich ingredients like illuminating pearls that brighten up the under eye and a subtle tinted pigment to provide coverage for dark circles. The formula's key ingredients are hyaluronic acid combined with squalene which hydrates and moisturizes the eye area.

“Squalane is a wonderful hydrator with a lighter texture so it absorbs quickly and doesn’t make the skin look overly greasy” says Debra Jaliman M.D. a board-certified dermatologist in New York City and the author of .

The product is available in two different hues: Sandstone for light to medium complexions and Terracota for dark to deeper tones.

We also love that the packaging is crafted from recyclable tree-free paper made with upcycled sugarcane making it environmentally friendly too.

This article examines recent employment declines in rail transportation a small but important component of the transportation and warehousing industry. Although employment in rail transportation remained relatively stable for most of the past 25 years it declined by 40000 jobs from November 2018 to December 2020. This article provides an analysis of the recent employment declines in the rail transportation industry.

After remaining stable for over two decades employment in the rail transportation industry began to decrease in November 2018 according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey.1 By December 2020 the industry had lost 40000 jobs. (See chart 1.) Many sources including both the public media and rail industry experts attributed the beginning of the industry’s employment losses to three main factors: the decline of the reliance on coal as a natural resource an uncertain trade environment and a new method of operations adopted by railroads called Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR). In addition a fourth factor the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic further exacerbated job losses in the industry.

Within the transportation and warehousing industry rail transportation is one of the smallest component industries in terms of employment. In fact rail transportation made up only 3 percent of transportation and warehousing employment as of November 2018 but the industry accounted for 33 percent of the 121000 jobs lost between November 2018 and December 2020. (See table 1 and chart 2.) Employment in rail transportation declined consistently throughout 2019 and into the beginning of 2020 accelerated in April and May of that year and then leveled off through December.

Industry composition of transportation and warehousing November 2018 Section Percent Air transportation 8.9 Rail transportation 3.3 Water transportation 1.2 Truck transportation 27.3 Transit and ground passenger transportation 8.9 Pipeline transportation 0.9 Scenic and sightseeing transportation 0.6 Support activities for transportation 13.5 Couriers and messengers 14.1 Warehousing and storage 21.1

The decline of coal

In 2019 U.S. railroads moved 4 million carloads of coal with each carrying enough coal to power 19 homes for an entire year. Five states accounted for approximately 71 percent of U.S. coal production in 2019 despite coal being consumed all over the country.2 However because of recent advances in natural gas extraction and the increased use of renewable resources to generate electricity the United States is becoming less reliant on coal as an energy source.3 In fact the movement of millions of coal carloads in 2019 actually represented a decline of 405000 or 9.2 percent over the year. According to Association of American Railroads (AAR) Vice President John T. Gray the number of coal carloads in 2019 were the lowest they had been in decades.4 With the United States relying less on coal the demand for rail cars that transport coal decreases. In turn there is a decrease in the need for rail cars overall as well as the need for employees to work on the railroads.

In 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic added to the decline in the use of coal as business closures shelter-in-place mandates and generally low demand from the public weakened the overall economy. In addition cheap natural gas prices prompted the increased use of natural gas instead of coal to generate electricity deepening the decline in the number of coal carloads further. As of April 25 2020 when the tightest of COVID-19 restrictions across the United States were still in effect coal was down 21.4 percent over the year.5 As shown in chart 3 the decline accelerated in the beginning of 2020.6 In fact the 2-month period (April and May 2020) in which the largest percentage declines in the number of coal carloads occurred corresponded with the rail industry’s largest over-the-month declines in employment. In addition once the country began to reopen in the summer the number of coal carloads began to increase and rail employment returned to smaller monthly declines. Although coal carloads do not correlate with rail employment on a month-by-month basis it is evident that reductions in coal carloads have a negative influence on rail employment.

An uncertain trade environment

Businesses strive to make efficient use of their time money and other resources and changes in the demand for rail transportation and impacts on their revenues as a result of trade uncertainties can impact the industry’s employment. Rail freight volumes and movement—how often trains are moving freight from one point to another—have recently been reduced by an uncertain trade environment involving the negotiations of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and trade relations between the United States and China. According to AAR economist Luisa Fernandez-Willey trade uncertainty and tariffs had a strong negative effect on the rail transportation industry in 2019 as 42 percent of rail carloads and intermodal units (units using two modes of freight such as truck and rail to transport goods) and 35 percent of annual rail revenue are associated with international trade.7 In addition about 50000 jobs worth over $5.5 billion in annual wages and benefits also depend on international trade.8 The relationship between rail carloads and international trade is strongly tied to employment as fewer carloads and lower revenue tied to international trade mean a reduced need for workers.

Even general uncertainty resulting from the United States’ trade relationships with other countries can lead to the hesitance of firms to hire and thus the USMCA and trade relations with China have been widely referenced in analyzing rail employment declines in 2019. Fernandez-Willey noted that clarity on trade would be vital for the rail industry to recover in 2020 stating that the ratification of the USMCA and the resolution of disputes with China would be the key factors to achieving this clarity.9

In 2019 uncertainty that is due to the ongoing disputes between the United States and China lowered demand for companies that move freight especially within the agriculture and manufacturing industries.10 These disputes included the United States and China imposing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other’s goods. Tensions ran especially high in 2019 with the two countries spending the last few months of the year threatening to impose new tariffs and increase existing tariffs against one another.11 Uncertainty appeared to grow out of the USMCA’s delayed ratification as well with the final outcome of the agreement relatively unclear for most of the year. In December 2019 the U.S. House of Representatives passed the USMCA which established key policy changes.12

In January 2020 it appeared trade uncertainty and its negative effect on rail employment may have started to fade once a phase-one trade deal with China was established and the USMCA was signed into law.13 However the positive outlook for trade and rail employment did not last long into 2020 once the COVID-19 pandemic began. Global trade and shipment volumes were disrupted throughout the year as people across the world stayed at home and quarantined in an effort to contain the virus. The Cass Freight Index for April 2020 released at the height of the U.S. stay-at-home orders is particularly revealing as it reported that shipment volumes dropped 22.7 percent and freight expenditures fell 18.2 percent year-over-year in North America.14 The COVID-19 recession appears to have held back improvements to trade uncertainty as little has changed regarding U.S. trade relations with China since the start of the pandemic.15 Recessions are also typically characterized by a surge in trade disputes and a slowdown in trade negotiations as rising unemployment heightens uncertainty.16

Precision Scheduled Railroading

Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) is a railroad strategy that uses departure schedules and point-to-point delivery methods to achieve low operating ratios (how much a company needs to spend to make a dollar) and consolidate railroad networks (the elimination of shorter less efficient lanes in favor of high-volume lanes).17 PSR may be the most widely accredited reason for the decrease in rail transportation employment. Before PSR was implemented the North American rail model which includes the United States and Canada focused on moving long trains with a single good in order to maximize capacity and yield the greatest efficiency. However this model was actually slowing down the rail network because trains would be late or canceled if they did not meet specific length requirements thus leaving customers unexpectedly without service. With the implementation of PSR the focus shifted to moving cars with mixed goods so that the trains are always moving and cars are picked up on schedule regardless of train length. Despite lower length requirements average train length increased because railroad companies were no longer discouraged from transporting multiple types of goods in a single train. As a result of PSR there is now more efficient timing and scheduling as well as an effective allocation of resources such as crews cars and locomotives in the places where they are needed on the rail network.18

North American railroads are divided by revenue into different classes. Class I railroads are the largest and have an annual operating revenue of at least $447621226 while Class II railroads are known as regional railroads and Class III railroads are known as short-line railroads.19 The practice of furloughing employees is rather common within the rail industry and usually depends on the volume of freight at a given point in time. After Class I railroads adopted PSR furloughs and layoffs in the industry increased. Rail companies including Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific have stated explicitly that they have furloughed or closed down certain operations because of PSR.20 Industry officials seem to hail the new efficiency PSR has brought to the railroads while union leaders have responded negatively because of its effect on employees. One article noted that reduced staffing is made possible by running longer trains as hitching two trains together allows one rail work crew to be cut. This coincides with a 25-percent increase in the average train length (1.4 miles) since 2008. In addition according to rail economist Jim Blaze seven major freight railroads idled nearly 30 percent of locomotives in 2019 alone as they aim to run fewer and longer trains.21

The North American Class I railroads that have adopted PSR as part of their operations include Canadian National Railway Canadian Pacific Railway Limited CSX Corporation Norfolk Southern Corporation Union Pacific Corporation and Kansas City Southern.22 The Surface Transportation Board (STB) regulates North American Class I railroads inside the United States and collects monthly data on employment and occupational composition. These data can be used to show changes in the occupational composition of some of the railroads that have implemented PSR while CES rail transportation employment data are not broken down by the specific type of job in which the workers perform. The STB breaks down the employment data into the following occupational classifications:

Executives officials and staff assistants

Professional and administrative

Maintenance of way and structures

Maintenance of equipment and stores

Transportation (other than train and engine)

Transportation (train and engine)

Thus the STB data show where in terms of types of jobs losses are occurring in the rail industry in a way that CES data do not. Chart 4 displays each of the STB’s occupational classifications and their employment since January 2018 showing little change from January 2018 to November 2018 as well as the changes in trend over the period from November 2018 to December 2020.23

The STB data show that the greatest job losses occurred in the occupational groups most directly involved with the actual operation and maintenance of trains on the railroads. Out of the 31000 jobs lost estimated by the STB transportation (train and engine) accounted for 46 percent of the losses from November 2018 to December 2020 despite representing less than 43 percent of all railroad jobs in November 2018. At the same time maintenance of equipment and stores jobs accounted for more than a quarter of the losses despite being less than a fifth of all employment in November 2018. In contrast the other classifications each contributed between 3 and 15 percent of the job losses over the same period. Although PSR appears to have altered the hiring and layoff decisions of rail establishments over the period employment in rail transportation began to flatten in the second half of 2020 indicating that railroads may have balanced out their employment levels with the new scheduling method.

Coronavirus delivers deeper losses

COVID-19 is discussed earlier in this article because the disease coincided and interacted with the other factors associated with the recent decline of employment in rail transportation. However the COVID-19 pandemic itself can be viewed as a fourth factor contributing to the decline of employment in rail transportation.

A national emergency regarding COVID-19 was declared on March 13 2020 as the virus began to rapidly spread throughout the United States. On March 15 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention discouraged gatherings of 50 or more people over the next 8 weeks prompting many business and school closures in a public health effort to slow the spread of the disease. By March 26 the United States led the world in confirmed coronavirus cases.24 As of April 20 over 316 million Americans in at least 42 states were being urged to stay home.25 COVID-19-related business closures during this period caused millions of Americans to lose their jobs and the rail transportation industry was no exception.26 Employment in rail transportation experienced two large monthly declines during the early months of the pandemic—April and May 2020—for a combined loss of 10000 jobs. This accounts for a quarter of the 40000 rail transportation jobs lost from November 2018 to December 2020 suggesting that the effects of the pandemic had a considerable impact on employment.

Chart 5 displays employment in rail transportation and the number of rail freight carloads over the period from January 2018 to December 2020.27 The two series moved similarly during April and May 2020 at the height of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and business closures. In fact both employment in rail transportation and rail freight carloads experienced notable contractions during those 2 months. However the two series have diverged since May 2020. After declining since January 2020 the number of rail freight carloads began to increase again in May which may be a result of the easing of state restrictions and businesses reopening in some capacity amid the pandemic. Despite the continuing spread of the virus every state had begun to at least partially reopen businesses by the end of May.28 From June to December employment in rail transportation began to level off while the volume of rail freight carloads continued to recover.

In addition news sources also recognized the negative effects of COVID-19 on railroads stating that the shelter-in-place mandates in April and May caused rail volume to be slashed. The COVID-19 pandemic had been predicted to result in a reduction in U.S. imports translating into less volume on the railroads.29 As a result Class I railroads had to deal with reduced demand by temporarily shutting down facilities with less rail traffic.30

In August a FreightWaves article stated that the STB and the Federal Railroad Administration who are responsible for enabling safe reliable and efficient movement of people and goods had asked the Class I railroads to resolve service issues that had arisen during the pandemic as a result of crew availability issues. At the same time labor unions questioned the railroads companies’ furlough practices stating that some recalled furloughed employees were being sidelined for a second time.31 This information suggests that railroads may have hired back workers earlier than they were needed which may explain the deceleration of rail transportation employment losses towards the end of 2020. However the pandemic is not over. New variants of COVID-19 could place further stress on the global economy and could make firms’ decisions regarding employment in the near future more uncertain.32

Summary

Rail transportation employment may be one of the smallest components of transportation and warehousing but recent job losses have been substantial with the industry losing 40000 jobs from November 2018 to December 2020. Rail industry experts and the public media speculate that the three main reasons for the job losses were the United States' decreased reliance on coal as a resource an uncertain trade environment and PSR—a new method of scheduling operations. The COVID-19 pandemic compounded these factors and affected rail transportation employment as a fourth factor. These factors suggest that some of these job losses may be permanent. Although we can acknowledge what led to the large declines in rail transportation employment over this period the future of the industry’s employment remains uncertain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL2pvdXJuYWxzdGFyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2hpc3RvcnkvamltLW1ja2VlLXRoZS1lZGlzb24tb2YtdGhlLXdlc3QtaW4tb2dhbGxhbGEvYXJ0aWNsZV9iNzJiN2UyYy05MTFiLTViMGItYTNiOC1kMTRhMDFhNWQ4ZDIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jim McKee: The Edison of the West in Ogallala,"When someone mentions Ogallala most immediately think of Lake McConaughy touristy Front Street or the legendary Boot Hill Cemetery.

Some will also recall it was on the Oregon and Chisholm trails was near Gill’s Pony Express Station and after the arrival of the Union Pacific Railroad in 1867 became a wild and untamed terminus for Texas cattle.

A very few will remember it as the home of Robert Goodall known by many worldwide as the Edison of the west though many histories of Keith County mention him only in passing and a couple of respected historians do not even mention him.

Henry E. Goodall was born in London in 1849. In 1872 he arrived in Nebraska vowing to go west “as far as the train would take him.” The rails ended at Howard Nebraska where he homesteaded and built a house probably of sod.

Henry was admitted to the Nebraska Bar in 1889 though he continued to operate a 950-acre ranch at Korty Nebraska. On Oct. 8 1891 his son Robert Aldrich Goodall was born at Grant Nebraska. Henry his wife Clarise and son Robert moved to Ogallala in 1897 where Henry began a law practice.

Around the turn of the century Anna Gray Clark bought the Democrat-leaning Keith County News from G. F. Cooper while Carrie Goodall purchased the Republican Argus. This led to friendly editorial competition between the two political factions and newspapers and also furnished readers a balance of opinions.

In 1909 Robert graduated from Ogallala High School received his bachelor's degree from Doane College in Crete in 1913 then attended the Omaha Horological Institute.

While still a student at Doane Robert obtained an electrician’s license and after completing the year-long Omaha course in only four months went to work at Jonathan Lucas’ jewelry store in Ogallala.

Scarcely a year later Robert purchased the store and began experimenting and inventing in the backroom. Within a short time he had perfected an electric watch and clock cleaning machine and a new type of soldering iron for detailed work. It is unclear exactly when the retail jewelry store closed but in 1927 Robert invented a non-synchronized talking machine designed to adapt silent films to sound. By the following year he had developed a commercial welder a walking lawn sprinkler a “cold light” for use by physicians and dentists and expanded into the area of sound equipment for movie theaters.

By World War II Goodall Electric Co. had not only introduced a spin casting fishing reel but with nearly 1000 employees at a point where Ogallala’s entire population was less than 3000 developed a new electrical rectifier and capacitor which he sold to the U.S. Navy for proximity fuses.

The company name changed slightly in 1944 to the Good-All Manufacturing Company and advertised “Good-All’s Goods are Always Good.” In businesses only tangentially related Robert had interests in oil and owned motion picture theaters in Grant Lyman North Platte Ong and Sutherland.

By the early 1950s Good-All’s major capacitor customer became Eastman Kodak. In 1953 Robert and Clarice donated the old American Legion building to the city becoming the Goodall Public Library. Later in 1953 Robert died leaving Clarice not only the beneficiary of the businesses but as “the first woman president of an oil company in the United States.” A separate corporation Ogallala Electronics began producing foil coils in 1961 and resumed making rectifiers in 1964.

The business was still healthy in 1984 when the sale of capacitors alone reached $8840000 but in that year Clarice Goodall died at the age of 93. At that point the Goodall family had donated the Goodall Science Building at Doane College the Redfern Boys' Ranch the Goodall Recreation Center in Ogallala and the city’s Goodall Public Library.

In 1987 most of the corporation was sold to TRW (Thompson-Ramo-Wooldridge) with the capacitor division ending up as Shizuki Electronics. The family name lives on as the Goodall Recreation Center and Goodall Drive in Ogallala but the Goodall Public Library at 203 W. A St. has been replaced by the Kathleen Lute Library.

UAL,United Airlines Holdings,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9pc3JhZWwtbmV3cy93aWxsLWlzcmFlbGktYWlybGluZS1lbC1hbC1yZWNlaXZlLXRoZS1jYXJyb3Qtb3ItdGhlLXN0aWNrLTY4MDg5N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Israeli airline El Al receive the carrot or the stick?,"It has been six months since the present owner of El Al Kenneth Rozenberg immigrated to Israel. As the CEO of Centers Health Care based in the US he brought a unique background to El Al which has been mired like all airlines in the global pandemic and has a history of labor relations within the company that rivals tin-pot dictatorships once prevalent in South America. He also holds a BA from Yeshiva University in psychology and a Master of Public Health degree from Columbia University.

No doubt vigilant readers of the news media have seen the countless interviews he’s given. Or perhaps he has chosen to release his thoughts in written form directly to the public which without their support El Al cannot exist. Or he limits his illuminations on the evening TV screens. No such luck I am afraid. Rozenberg once known for his strong public speaking role has stayed silent. Other than his family and a handful of El Al executives nobody is privy to his survival plan for El Al.

He appointed Avigal Soreq as CEO; his 10-year role in leading Delek Holdings had him residing in Nashville Tennessee the last decade. To be honest managing large fuel companies has given him a very strong managerial background and he has been the face and voice of El Al during the last six months ricocheting from crisis to crisis. The Israel government played hard and fast with El Al; at times offering a carrot if they would take the severe step and make redundant thousands of El Al employees.

El Al like the other Israeli airlines Israir and Arkia spent countless hours begging for government assistance from both the Netanyahu and Bennett administrations. Soreq agreed almost immediately to lay off almost 1900 employees nearly one-third of their staff as negotiations with the government proceeded.

Finally in August the Treasury agreed to give El Al a balloon loan of up to $200 million dollars with no repayment for the first two years. Moreover they agreed to pay in advance for 20 years the cost of El Al’s security expenses. They had been footing the bill for 90% of the security costs appreciating that El Al’s security needs dwarfed what other airlines dealt with. Along with their largesse they required Rosenberg to invest millions more which to his credit he acquiesced.

Unfortunately nobody bothered to bring the Histadrut Israel’s all powerful labor union into the picture. Callously or capriciously the Histadrut declared a labor dispute a few days after El Al received the good news threatening that if any of the Israeli airlines dared to initiate more labor layoffs a strike would be called. For several weeks El Al battled both internally and externally its twin demons: a workforce cognizant of the massive changes required to keep El Al afloat and management’s inability to plan for the short- and near-term future.

THE GLOBAL pandemic has decimated airlines. Its effect on tourism is still being felt from Australia to Zimbabwe. Many national airlines did receive government assistance; many had strong management in place who curtailed the frequency of flights and worked with the labor unions. El Al had zero assets in its arsenal. Weak and tepid management coupled with a silent owner and a government unsure if letting El Al go bankrupt would benefit the aviation sector in the long term have left El Al in the lurch.

Travel experts have espoused for over a decade that El Al’s desire to fly everywhere and compete with both low-cost and full-service airlines has led El Al to bleed money astronomically. Past management simply added new routes with little market research investing millions in promoting the routes only to discontinue them months later. Anyone remember El Al’s foray into Las Vegas or into South America? El Al started a low-cost carrier with the same costs of the regular El Al. It hemorrhaged money and it too was shuttered.

For years El Al has been advised to cease making partnership agreements with other airlines who later denounce them and focus on their strongest market. North America remains and will continue to be the largest market for both outgoing and incoming travel. Flying to JFK Newark Miami and Los Angeles along with Toronto has been El Al’s bread and butter for decades.

El Al needs to return flights to Boston and Chicago. They must resume flights to San Francisco and add Washington and Dallas to the mix. If market studies show there is a reason to fly to Montreal then that city should be added. Adding nonstop flights to more and more cities in North America is the most intelligent decision El Al should be making. Of course El Al needs to fly to major European cities in the UK France Germany Spain and Italy. El Al plane (credit: ERIC GAILLARD/REUTERS)

The other cities though should be dropped like a hot stone; with low-cost carriers dominating so many second-tier cities in Europe it is futile for El Al to try to compete.

El Al must add and enhance flights to the Far East be it Shanghai and Tokyo along with their existing flights to Hong Kong and Beijing. Forget about South America or the rest of Asia.

If ego and politics makes El Al fly to the United Arab Emirates then so be it; it will never be profitable with Fly Dubai Arkia Israir Emirates and Etihad all vying for a piece of the pie.

EXHAUSTED BY El Al’s reluctance to create a five-year plan to say nothing of a vision for 2022 Treasury officials dropped the other shoe. To obtain the government loan El Al had to agree to sell more than one-third of their fleet reducing it from 45 to 29 planes. The reduction will be in the older gas guzzling aircraft as El Al is forced to cut their routes. In addition despite the insipid Labor Federation more layoffs must be made.

One other revenue-producing action was the strong request to sell El Al’s frequent flier program something many airlines have done. Their database is a gold mine and hopefully El Al management will achieve a strong return. Many airlines used their clubs to borrow money to see them through the slump in demand for travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. In essence miles earned by a passenger are sold to credit card companies who use them as part of their reward programs to their customers.

The revenues earned from selling the miles are far higher than the cost of any flight travel redeemed by passengers. Delta Airlines borrowed $6.5 billion backed by its SkyMiles loyalty program. United Airlines values its Mileage Plus program at nearly $22 billion dollars which is more than United Airlines is worth. The carrot that the Israel Treasury offered to El Al was an additional $50 million loan as the recovery has taken longer than expected when the first loans were given.

One would like to believe that Rozenberg and Soreq would review this latest proposal and realize the cleverness it contained. One would also like to believe that the Health Ministry has finally come up with a detailed plan that would let all tourists back into the country. And one would be very wrong.

In fact El Al’s CEO – Major Soreq who was an air force pilot as well as an accountant – rejected it out of hand writing back that “El Al demands immediate compensation of $100 million for damage caused to El Al due to decisions by the state.” Wow impressive rebuttal on several levels.

First you have to love the emphasis on immediate compensation as well as the amount. Hutzpah that Israeli trait all Israelis are born with was not tarnished by his years in Nashville. No southern hospitality in that statement straight to the throat.

And a nice touch in blaming the state for Israel’s woes.

Attached to Soreq’s letter to the Finance Ministry was also a letter from Rozenberg committing to work on behalf of El Al. The letter said “I take full responsibility as part of proper corporate procedure to protect its stability nurturing and growth especially during this time. My commitment to El Al is no small matter. El Al is an enterprise that requires major long-term investment.”

Heartwarming words but my fear is that his definition of long-term investment alludes only to capital. What he needs to invest in is brainpower and a strong management that can see the future and move forward.

It’s a sign of our times that Israir the most vocal Israeli airline over the last year is owned by Rami Levy whose background is in supermarkets before branching out into property development. Israir’s CEO Uri Sirkis has been at the forefront of criticizing the government over its topsy-turvy policy when it comes to handling the pandemic in regard to travel and tourism. He has been leading the choir to open the skies; when a new peace treaty is signed or a country allows Israelis to enter Israir has quickly added flights.

El Al meanwhile has stumbled like a drunk person hitting wall after wall trying to find an open space. I’m not comparing Israir whose fleet of planes doesn’t reach double digits to El Al; but I admire the tenacity of Israir’s management to boldly outline its future. Truth be told Israir’s decision to stop flying on Shabbat will come back to haunt them but again it’s their owner who has decided on this policy and has the wherewithal to make it happen.

IS EL AL going to follow in Beitar Jerusalem’s steps? The famed football team has seen owner after owner invest millions of dollars in a club that is fueled with talent but internally has factions that make success near impossible. The latest owner tech founder Moshe Hogeg had a revelation right after Rosh Hashanah. After three years and a futile attempt to bring in an investor from the United Arab Emirates he announced his desire to sell his share and run not walk as far away as he could.

Like Rozenberg he didn’t see Beitar Jerusalem as a business and happily donated millions to the club. Not seeking personal gain he never asked for a medal or a thank you; simply a modicum of respect. Once he realized that both fans and management were at odds with his vision he chose to quit.

El Al is at the same crossroads; there is an owner willing to invest millions. There is a public willing to give him a chance and the government is offering financial rewards. Like a football team one needs a strong team with an even stronger coaching staff. Beitar’s owner was wrong – Beitar Jerusalem is a business as is El Al.

Aviation is not a toy as much as gallivanting around the world is a pleasure. It is dollars and cents and that requires a helluva lot of sense. El Al doesn’t have it today or if they do it’s a hidden secret that only a select few have knowledge.

Put together a team – insiders and outsiders frequent flyers bean counters dreamers and realists – and decide finally to reinvent El Al. If this pandemic has taught us anything it’s that we are in a brand-new world and those insightful enough to live within it will soar. If not like TWA and dozens of other airlines that no longer exist your time is over.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite File)

(NEXSTAR) – If you often pay bills or mail gifts at the last minute you may want to rethink your mailing timeline: The United States Postal Service is now giving itself more time to deliver first-class mail.

The USPS has been struggling with budgetary concerns for years based on pension obligations and a decline in mail use. Now the agency is relaxing its “service standards” to make on-time delivery less expensive and more consistent.

A first-class parcel was previously expected to arrive within three days of mailing but the agency now says the standard going forward is two to five days. That should mean more truck travel and fewer costly flights on planes the USPS doesn’t own.

“The Postal Service will increase time‐in‐transit standards by 1 or 2 days for certain mail that is traveling longer distances. By doing so the Postal Service can entrust its ground network to deliver more First-Class Mail which will lead to greater consistency reliability and efficiency that benefits its customers” agency representatives wrote in a press release last week.

The agency estimates that 61% of first-class mail and 93% of periodicals will be unaffected by the changes. In a fact sheet posted online USPS says anything within a three-hour drive of your mailing location should still arrive within two days.

According to The Washington Post the slowdown will not hit all states evenly. Deliveries to less dense states such as Nevada and Montana are expected to take longer on average than some more dense-destination states.

The changes are part of a reorganization known as the Delivering for America Strategic Plan developed under Postmaster General Louis DeJoy an ally of former President Donald Trump.

That 10-year plan calls for electrifying the delivery fleet expanding package delivery and modernizing the retail locations among other changes.

The next round of changes comes on Oct. 3 when temporary holiday price surcharges go into effect.

Through Dec. 26 the USPS plans to tack on an additional 30 cents to a typical parcel and a dollar or more to some other less common types of returns and mailings. The breakdown is available in a recent press release from USPS.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJuei5jby5uei9uZXdzL25hdGlvbmFsLzQ1Mjc2NC91bml0ZWQtc3RhdGVzLXBvc3RhbC1zZXJ2aWNlLXN1c3BlbmRzLW1haWwtZGVsaXZlcmllcy10by1uZXctemVhbGFuZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United States Postal Service suspends mail deliveries to New Zealand,"The United States Postal Service (USPS) has suspended mail deliveries to New Zealand due to an unavailability of transportation.

The USPS said on its website that it was temporarily suspending international mail acceptance for a number of destinations.

It said this was due to ""impacts related to the Covid-19 pandemic and other unrelated service disruptions"".

New Zealand and 21 other countries were listed as being suspended due to ""unavailability of transportation"".

Australia and Samoa were also among the suspended destinations.

The USPS asked customers to ""please refrain from mailing items addressed to the countries listed here until further notice"".

Disrupted USPS services to New Zealand included priority mail first class packages airmail and surface mail.

It said military and diplomatic mail would not be affected unless noted.

In September last year New Zealand Post announced the USPS had increased charges for mail and parcel delivery which meant the cost to send mail to the US would ""increase considerably"".

Despite a top-15 finish and scoring the fourth-most points Matt Crafton left Talladega frustrated with John Hunter Nemechek.

The three-time NASCAR Camping World Truck Series champion may have scored points in both Stages but it almost didn’t happen. Aggressive bump drafting from Nemechek forced Crafton to fight for control in his No. 88 Zep / Menards Toyota Tundra. The ThorSport Racing driver was livid on the team radio after the contact in exiting Turn 2 at the end of Stage 2.

After avoiding ‘the big one’ Crafton found himself sixth by the time the white flag waved. However he was swept up in one of three accidents that took place on the final lap. Crafton limped his battered Tundra back to the start-finish line in 14th.

“Stage 2 off of Turn 2 there at the end he (John Hunter Nemechek) hits me off of the corner” explained Crafton. “He’s smarter than that. I’m fine with getting hit going down the straightaway for stage points but not coming off of the corner but what comes around goes around sometimes. At the end of the day these guys brought me a really fast Menards Toyota Tundra.”

Although Crafton finished outside the top-10 he stilled scored the fourth-most points of those in the race. Finishes of third and fourth in the first two Stages added 15-points to his tally in the Chevrolet Silverado 250.

After the chaotic finish Crafton sits third on the playoff grid. He is just five-points above the playoff cutoff held by Sheldon Creed. The 45-year-old has a 10-point cushion over the first driver on the outside looking in for the Championship Four Stewart Friesen. Crafton is 26-points behind leader Nemechek.

Only one more race stands between Crafton and a chance at a fourth championship the United Rentals 200 at Martinsville Speedway.

On October 18 at approximately 1 PM a 67-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital through the emergency department. He had complaints of nausea pain and vomiting. The admitting assessment was acute dehydration secondary to a lithotripsy he had a day earlier to treat bladder stones. The complete blood count on admission was remarkable for low hemoglobin and hematocrit and elevated white blood cells. The patient was given fluids and pain medication throughout October 18. He also received 2 doses of a powerful anticoagulant pursuant to the orders of his urologist.

At 11 PM a telephone order from the urologist was transcribed. It advised bed rest for the patient said the IV rate should be increased to 150 cc’s per hour and asked that the physician on call be contacted for further orders. The internist on call was contacted pursuant to the urologist’s order. The patient’s chart indicated that the internist gave telephone orders for an increase in the IV rate to 150 mL per hour strict bed rest for the patient and application of a posey vest as needed. The internist later countersigned these orders.

At 6:25 AM the following morning the patient’s condition deteriorated significantly. The internist was again called. He left orders advising the hospital nurses to administer a diuretic and to have his partner another internist examine the patient as soon as possible. The patient coded at 7 AM and was pronounced dead at 7:20 AM.

An autopsy revealed 2500 mL of blood in the patient’s lower abdomen caused by an extensive hemorrhage into the bladder wall. The lithotripsy had caused a bladder stone to become embedded deep in the bladder wall commencing a slow bleed.

The patient’s widow was appointed his administrator. She sued the urologist the urologist’s health care group the hospital and the internist alleging medical malpractice. The widow argued that despite her husband’s deterioration all defendants failed to institute proper care causing him to slowly bleed to death.

The plaintiff further contended that the orders attributed to the internist in the hospital chart supposedly having been given at 11 PM October 18 were inadequate and below the standard of care. She argued that at the time the internist was called it would have been possible to reverse the effects of the anticoagulant medication perform surgery to repair the bleed and save her husband’s life.

The internist testified during deposition that he never gave orders to the hospital nurses when called. He said he was not on call for the urologist and that if the urologist wanted a consultation from him then the urologist needed to call him. The internist admitted countersigning the orders. The urologist testified during deposition that he wanted an urgent consultation from the internist but agreed that his order as taken down by the nurse did not reflect the fact that he was requesting an urgent consultation.

The patient’s widow claimed between $85000 and $200000 in economic damages. After a 6-day jury trial 5 men and 7 women returned a 10-to-2 defense verdict. Prior to trial the hospital was dismissed as a defendant for a waiver of costs. Additionally the urologist was dismissed as a defendant with prejudice under confidential terms.

LEGAL PERSPECTIVE: When a plaintiff dismisses a defendant prior to trial and that dismissal is “with prejudice” the plaintiff is barred from ever again bringing that claim in any court. Contrast this with a dismissal “without prejudice” where the plaintiff may subsequently bring their claim in another court. Generally when a settlement is reached a settling defendant will require that as part of the agreement all claims against him be dismissed with prejudice to bring an end to the controversy. Here the urologist secured under confidential terms a dismissal with prejudice meaning the widow could never bring her claims against him in any other court. Because the hospital had also been dismissed the case proceeded only against the internist and the internist’s medical group at trial.",,,,,,,,,

Health is a state of complete physical mental and social well-being: WHO Right to Health is not a fundamental right in Constitution

Right to Health is not a fundamental right in Constitution Right to health is when the state is duty bound to provide health to all

New Delhi: According to the Constitution of India health is a state subject. However the central government also plays an important role in establishing public healthcare infrastructure. Together the governments at the centre and state should provide adequate healthcare and preventive health facilities to the citizens but as of now they are not constitutionally obligated to do so. This is because the ‘Right to Health’ has not been enshrined as a fundamental right in the Constitution. To understand what Right to Health is and why even after seven decades of independence the subject of health remains a low priority in the country where expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP is just a little over 1 per cent NDTV spoke with Amitabh Behar Chief Executive Officer of Oxfam India and Dr Yogesh Jain who runs a community hospital in rural Bilaspur Chhattisgarh and is a member of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan national network of civil society organizations and people’s movements working for health rights.

What Is Right To Health?

According to Dr Jain Right to Health means a person’s right to remain healthy and to be able to access healthcare which also includes preventive healthcare such as adequate food water and sanitation environment and all the other requirements for preventing illnesses and promoting health. He stressed that health must be looked at in a holistic way as the World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as a state of complete physical mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Dr Jain further said that the right to health is something that is justiciable and which holds the system to account that it provides care. Dr Jain said

Right to health will make denial of health justiciable which empowers the citizens to sue the state if they are sick and unable to access care.

Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees protection of life and personal liberty to every citizen

Article 39 (E) directs the State to secure the health of workers

Article 42 directs the State to just and humane conditions of work and maternity relief

Article 47 casts a duty on the State to raise the nutrition levels and standard of living of people and to improve public health

Article 243G endows the Panchayats and Municipalities to strengthen public health

The Directive Principles of State Policy in Part IV of the Indian Constitution provide a basis for the right to health

However the Constitution gives no explicit recognition of the right to health or healthcare as a fundamental right. While talking about neglecting health as a fundamental right Mr Behar said

The question really is that why is health still not a political priority? If you look at successive governments we have done lip service to the idea of the Right to Health. There are two major reasons behind this. First the successive governments and the political system do not feel that health is a critical political issue and people would either reward or punish the government for their performance around health. Second a large private sector lobby in healthcare has emerged in the last 2-3 decades which also ensures that the public health system remains weak. Broadly speaking this is the whole problem of governance that even after over 70 years of Independence we have not been able to provide basic services which are pretty much the fundamental rights of the citizens. Education is also in a similarly bad state so is water and sanitation.

According to Dr Jain people’s right to lead a good life does not find a way into the political discourse easily. He said

The people who decide most of the things are not the ones who suffer the consequences of their decision and people who suffer the consequences don’t have the voice in the system. This is because our polity – whether it is the people in power or the people in opposition are not taking side of the citizens. Sure there are some schemes but healthcare cannot run as schemes it has to become a right.

Public Healthcare Infrastructure In India Marred By Acute Shortages

In its report earlier this year the 15th Finance Commission for 2021-26 revealed the acute shortage of workforce and infrastructure faced by the public health sector in India. It said that every allopathic doctor in India caters to at least 1511 people much higher than the WHO’s norm of one doctor for every 1000 people.

The shortage of trained nurses is even worse with a nurse-to-population ratio of 1:670 against the WHO norm of 1:300 the 15th Finance Commission said.

The 15th Finance Commission report said

Among the major states Bihar Chhattisgarh Jharkhand Madhya Pradesh Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh are way behind others in government doctors-to-population ratio. The shortfall of nurses is highest in Bihar Jharkhand Sikkim Telangana Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

The Finance Commission report described the hospital beds-to-population ratio as a “crude proxy” of the vulnerability of a health system.

India is estimated to have a total of 1899228 hospital beds (over 60 per cent of which are in the private sector) that is roughly 1.4 beds per 1000 population. This is lower than in many comparator countries: China’s bed density exceeds four per 1000; Sri Lanka the United Kingdom and the United States have around three per 1000; and in Thailand and Brazil hospital beds exceed two per 1000 persons it observed.

The WHO norm says that there should be at least 5 beds per 1000 population. According to the Department-Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare 2020 in terms of the government hospital beds in India there are mere 0.5 beds for every 1000 population.

The commission found that there was a significant shortfall in the number of centres required ranging from 23 per cent for sub-centres to 28 per cent for Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCs) to 37 per cent for Community Healthcare Centres (CHCs). There is severe deficit of public health facilities in Bihar Jharkhand Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal it said.

According to the Rural Health Statistics 2019-20 released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in May 2021 there is a shortfall of 78.9 per cent of Surgeons 69.7 per cent of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 78.2 per cent of Physicians and 78.2 per cent of Pediatricians in rural areas which as per the Population Census 2011 has almost 69 per cent of the total population of the country.

High Out-Of-Pocket Medical Expenditure And Unequal Access To Healthcare

According to the Union Budget 2021-22 the public health expenditure in the country is just 1.2 per cent of the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and is among the lowest in the world lower even that of other South Asian countries like Sri Lanka (1.6 per cent) and Bhutan (3.5) per cent. The Economic Survey has strongly recommended increasing the public health spending to 2.5-3 per cent of GDP as recommended in the National Health Policy 2017 and said that increased public spending can decrease the out-of-pocket expenditure to 30 per cent.

According to the Economic Survey 2020-21 in India 65 per cent of the overall health expenditure is out-of-pocket which is very high as compared to the world average of 18.2 per cent. It observed that bulk of the healthcare in India is provided by the private sector which is more expensive than the government facilities.

Private hospitals charge much higher than government hospitals for treatment of same ailment and higher charges do not assure better quality it said.

The findings of the first phase of the National Family Health Survey round 5 (NFHS-5) has also highlighted that average out of pocket expenditure for delivery in a public health facility has risen in 10 states and two Union Territories. Commenting on this Dr Jain said that the available data of NFHS-5 reflects the situation before COVID-19 hit and so the numbers are likely to be worse now as the country fights Covid. NITI Ayog has highlighted that because of high out-of-pocket expenditure 6.3 crore people fall into poverty every year.

The government has also recognised the rising costs of healthcare and has been running a few schemes to deal with this –

• Ayushman Bharat- Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojna (PMJAY) that aims at providing a health cover of Rs. 5 lakhs per family per year for hospitalization to the poor

• Janani-Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) under the National Health Mission (NHM) aims to make maternal services more accessible and affordable by providing free institutional deliveries free medicines free diagnosis at Government health facilities

• Surakshit Matritva Aashwasan is committed to provide assured dignified respectful and quality healthcare at no cost to women and newborn at public healthcare facility.

• National Health Mission Free Drugs Service Initiative which provides essential drugs free of cost in public health facilities

However out of pocket expenditure remains high and is still rising say experts adding that these schemes seem to be not working as efficiently as required. In September 2020 Oxfam’s ‘Commitment to Reducing Inequality’ Report ranked India fourth from the bottom in terms of expenditure on health. Mr Behar said

Out-of-pocket expenditure is one of the biggest reasons for people falling into poverty leading to a vicious cycle of poor health outcomes and poverty. Every government has said that investment will be made in the health of 2-3 per cent of the GDP but in reality this does not happen. The budget for the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for 2021-22 the allocation was lower than what was for health in 2020-21. This shows that no lesson was learnt from the experience till now. COVID-19 also has exposed a lot of faults in our public health system. Ayushman Bharat is something that has certainly not worked. Insurance schemes cannot substitute the right to health. Out-of-pocket expenditure is something that is not covered by Ayushman Bharat. Most of the cost that usually people incur are on diagnostic medicines which is not getting covered here. Also of the total admission 65 per cent of claims were paid till last year. This means that 35 per cent of people who were admitted and wanted the claims were not paid.

Oxfam India’s ‘India Inequality Report 2021: India’s Unequal Health Story’ also highlgihts how the people from general category are better off in terms of access to health than people from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. It also revealed that Hindus perform better than Muslims the rich perform better than the poor men are better off than women and the urban population is better off than the rural population on various health indicators such as life expectancy infant mortality rate and nutrition.

Health in India is a luxury that can be afforded by the rich and those in the mainstream. The marginalised who face more vulnerabilities due to poor housing lack of adequate sanitation use of biomass as fuel however are still away from the health equity said Dr Jain.

In A Country Where Healthcare Is A Luxury Right To Health Is An Urgent Need Of The Hour: Experts

According to the experts the COVID-19 pandemic should be a wake-up call an alarm bell for universal access to health in the country where it is still a luxury and not a right. Mr Behar said

It has been a devastating one and a half years. The second wave was absolutely heart wrenching to see people die waiting for a bed but I still don’t see a serious rethink on what should be done on health. It is important to recognize that strong health laws will help build resilience to future pandemics. Three things that the country urgently need to do is- recognize right to health fulfil the commitment of 2.5 per cent of GDP to be invested in health and focus on building public health infrastructure. Any public health insurance scheme can be an add on but not a replacement of the right to health.

In the past various Members of Parliament (MPs) have introduced bills demanding right to health state governments of states like Rajasthan Chhattisgarh Tamil Nadu have also talked considered the idea of right to health but nowhere in the country has it become a law yet.

NDTV – Dettol have been working towards a clean and healthy India since 2014 via Banega Swachh India initiative which is helmed by Campaign Ambassador Amitabh Bachchan. The campaign aims to highlight the inter-dependency of humans and the environment and of humans on one another with the focus on One Health One Planet One Future – Leaving No One Behind. It stresses on the need to take care of and consider everyone’s health in India – especially vulnerable communities – the LGBTQ population indigenous people India’s different tribes ethnic and linguistic minorities people with disabilities migrants geographically remote populations gender and sexual minorities. In wake of the current COVID-19 pandemic the need for WASH (Water Sanitation and Hygiene) is reaffirmed as handwashing is one of the ways to prevent Coronavirus infection and other diseases. The campaign will continue to raise awareness on the same along with focussing on the importance of nutrition and healthcare for women and children fight malnutrition mental wellbeing self care science and health adolescent health & gender awareness. Along with the health of people the campaign has realised the need to also take care of the health of the eco-system. Our environment is fragile due to human activity that is not only over-exploiting available resources but also generating immense pollution as a result of using and extracting those resources. The imbalance has also led to immense biodiversity loss that has caused one of the biggest threats to human survival – climate change. It has now been described as a “code red for humanity.” The campaign will continue to cover issues like air pollution waste management plastic ban manual scavenging and sanitation workers and menstrual hygiene. Banega Swasth India will also be taking forward the dream of Swasth Bharat the campaign feels that only a Swachh or clean India where toilets are used and open defecation free (ODF) status achieved as part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014 can eradicate diseases like diahorrea and the country can become a Swasth or healthy India.

For two years the government ran a pilot on the affordable health insurance scheme in four counties of the 47 in the East African nation in order to assess its use and implementation.

Among the highest services sought after with this card is the maternal health cover the Linda Mama cover.

“The idea (UHC) came earlier as early as 2016 but was launched officially in 2018 by the Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta. UHC basically started with the Linda Mama cover this was an idea of the president to make sure that women are able to deliver without any difficulties. This is basically to ensure that we reduce maternal mortality"" says Dr. Thomas Ogaro Head of the UHC Secretariat Nairobi Metropolitan Service.

During the pilot the UHC card was being used and the services were approved free but authorities say what was learned is that they may not be sustainable.

""But now what we are rolling out is the registration of poor and vulnerable population who are unable to access so that we are able to give them insurance subsidy. And this insurance subsidy will be through our National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF). ” explains Dr. Ogaro.

When the UHC was finally rolled out in 2020 it was merged with the existing National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) card with the 'Linda Mama' being the only new free card introduced.

'Linda Mama' is a free health insurance cover that is especially targeting women in Kenyan slums and rural areas. It is meant for the women that can’t afford the NHIF card which goes for less than 5dollars a month. It covers the pregnancy and expires three months after delivery.

Dr. Thomas Ogaro tell us more. ""Linda mama is just for that period of that pregnancy. It covers the pregnancy and delivery and the child post-natal for upto a certain level immunization I think the most important I think it is just delivery. Post-natal for a very short time until the immunization is complete”.

Linda Mama cover which can be accessed in all public hospitals some charity and faith based organizations or even registered on the phone through short code *263# has seen a rise in women giving birth in the hospital with a high number forgoing the common cheap alternative of using traditional midwives or the risky option of birthing at home.

Jeff Momanyi Director and Founder of Medical Link Intergrated Health Community Hospital (MELIHELP) a non-profit community health centre started in 2014 meant to provide affordable quality health services to the less privileged living in the informal settlements in Nairobi attests to this.

“Now 90 percent of the mother we are helping deliver are attending ANC clinics and they are visiting hospitals. Which is good for our society and which is good for our government”.

Some slum residents already have started to benefit from this.

""I got my baby on the 7th of December 2020… I delivered in Pumwani Maternity hospital. It was good. I used the Linda mama cover. And there were no extra charges. I registered when at nine months pregnant. I have been coming here for my clinics.” says new Mom Maureen Adhiambo from the Mareba slum.

Felista Mbithe from the Lunga Slum says she wouldn’t have afforded the hospital if not for Linda Mama. “Someone told me about Linda mama and that is what I am using here… because my husband doesn’t have the NHIF card. We have no money. This card is really helping us women"".

And there are many expectant mothers as well. “I would have struggled without Linda Mama. I would have had to look for a traditional midwife.” Feddie Mercy Muteti explained.

But Linda mama has its own challenges. Dr. Ogaro shares some of the challenges with us.

Firstly the government facilities are not fully equipped and are perceived inferior to private hospitals. As well as delayed reimbursement from the government to the health facilities.

**“Some of the clients don’t trust our services which are quality until they access them and see.. you find sometimes delayed reimbursement from the facility. So the facility makes the claims and the pay is delayed but finally we pay” **

Kenyan women are not only ignorant of the free service but a good number especially from vulnerable backgrounds don’t go for clinics before delivery.

""Most women they do not have access to information about pregnancy and maternal care services. Secondly poverty is a major issue normally for these women that keeps them from seeking proper medical. And most of the government hospitals have no functional equipment to provide proper tests like scans that these women need. It makes it hard for women during delivery leading to death or other complications.” the Director of the Kenya Association For Maternal and NeoNatal health Richard Karori says.

According to research done in 2020 by a local Kenyan non-profit working with young urban women Africa Youth Trust young women in Nairobi and Mombasa slums complain of the extra charges that they incur during delivery like buying supplies etc.

The Linda mama only covers complications related to pregnancy but other problems such as car accidents or diseases unrelated to pregnancy are not covered. One of its biggest challenge is the need for an identity card to access the services has blocked teenage girls from accessing the cover. And although women can use the cover in all public health centres some charity and faith based health facilities it is difficult for private hospitals to take up the cover. Which is important considering that the government facilities are not sufficient for the country’s population.

The government of Kenya has taken great strides in ensuring quality free maternity services reaches even the poorest in the country and a reduction of maternal mortality rate has been experienced already.

The challenges remain in enhancing the quality of services provided by the public hospital and providing civic education on maternal care and free cover. However Kenya seems apace with its mission to provide universal health coverage for its people by 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyZWFraW5nbmV3cy5pZS9leHBsYWluZWQvZXhwbGFpbmVkLXdoYXQtaXMtc2xhaW50ZWNhcmUtYW5kLXdoYXRzLXRoZS1jb250cm92ZXJzeS1hYm91dC0xMTkzMzAwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Explained: What is Sláintecare and what's the controversy about?,"Sláintecare has been hanging around the political agenda for years now but recent resignations of key personnel working in the programme have brought the initiative back into focus.

The programme has faced so many delays that it's easy to forget what it was set up to achieve. Here's everything you need to know about Sláintecare as it faces its latest controversy...

What is Sláintecare?

In short Sláintecare is an initiative aimed at abolishing the State's two-tier health system replacing it instead with a universal healthcare model. Such set-ups can be seen across Europe with the UK's National Health Service (NHS) seen as prime example.

The idea for the new programme came about following the 2016 general election with all Oireachtas parties supporting the reform.

Sláintecare's broad aims were to improve the experience of patients/service users improve the experience of clinicians lower healthcare costs and achieve better healthcare outcomes. A major point in achieving these goals would be tackling the discrepancy between waiting times for patients with private health insurance versus public patients who often face long waiting times to access treatments and services.

In practical terms its aims include the phasing out private beds in public hospitals reducing and removing charges for the likes of inpatient care and prescription charges for medical cardholders and expanding primary care in a bid to switch healthcare from hospitals into the community.

Another key element of the programme is the establishment of Regional Health Areas which will break the State into six areas each responsible for its own budget planning and hospital/community care delivery going back to the system which existed before the establishment of the HSE.

How is Sláintecare going to be made a reality?

The specifics of the programme were laid out in the Sláintecare report published in May 2017 by the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare.

Social Democrats co-leader Róisin Shortall chaired the committee which included 13 other TDs from across the political parties tasked with considering how best to ensure access to an ""affordable universal single-tier healthcare system in which patients are treated promptly on the basis of need rather than ability to pay"".

The Sláintecare report stated 10 key recommendations for the programme covering aspects such as funding implementation and the expansion of both primary and social care services. Each recommendation was further broken down into key markers - such as universal palliative care and the removal of inpatient charges for public hospital care - many of which were costed and given dates by which time they should be achieved within a 10-year period.

The Government responded to the report by publishing the Sláintecare Implementation Strategy in July 2018 covering the actions to be taken in the first three years of the timeline.

Who is overseeing the programme?

The Department of Health has overall responsibility for Sláintecare but the day-to-day implementation as the name suggests lies with the Sláintecare Programme Implementation Office. Established in 2018 the group's first task was to review and refine the aforementioned Sláintecare Implementation Strategy breaking down the three-year goals into more detailed Action Plans to be published and updated each year.

The Sláintecare Implementation Advisory Council (SIAC) is an independent group established in October 2018 to provide advice and support to the Implementation Office. The SIAC began with 21 members combining ""patient/service user representatives senior health service leaders clinical leadership and a number of independent change experts from outside the health service"".

As the existing healthcare model the HSE has a role to play in matters however as the Sláintecare programme looks to radically alter the health service there have long been reports of resistance from the current executive.

Over the next three years Sláintecare will take a focus on chronic disease management and older person’s integrated care.

By focusing on prevention we aim to shift care away from acute hospitals into the community & closer to people’s homes.#ReframingAgeing #PositiveAgeingWeek pic.twitter.com/e5IkBGqdnJ Advertisement — Sláintecare (@slaintecare) September 28 2021

And what's the hold up?

As with most things one of the issues holding up the implementation of the plan is money.

The reforms laid out in the Sláintecare report would transform the healthcare system tackling issues that have blighted the health service for decades. However these changes will not come cheap.

In addition sticking points like the establishment of Regional Health Areas and the approach to universal healthcare have divided stakeholders while wider healthcare issues such as the shortage of consultants GPs and hospital beds also feed into the problem as long waiting lists cannot be properly addressed if the resources are not available.

So what's the controversy over now?

Sláintecare has been back in the headlines in recent weeks after key personnel involved in the programme and the SIAC resigned.

On September 8th the programme's executive director Laura Magahy and the SIAC's chair Prof Tom Keane separately announced their decisions to step down from their respective roles. Just three weeks later another SIAC member Prof Anthony O'Connor also confirmed his resignation.

According to The Irish Times Prof Keane attributed his decision to his unhappiness over how the programme was being delivered stating: ""Sadly I have come to conclude that the requirements for implementing this unprecedented programme for change are seriously lacking.""

Laura Magahy and Prof Tom Keane both resigned from their respective positions in early September.

Meanwhile Prof O'Connor predicted the initiative is ""doomed to fail"" in his resignation letter and said the regionalisation of healthcare ""will not happen"".

Some SIAC members expressed their ""shock regret and concern"" in a statement issued following Prof Keane and Ms Magahy's resignations while Dr Eddie Molloy one of the group members who signed the statement told RTÉ that the Minister for Health's ""resistance and delay"" in implementing the Regional Health Areas was likely a factor.

The departures are significant as they raise questions regarding the feasibility of Sláintecare as a whole when some of the programme's key drivers opt to walk away.

How do we get the show back on the road?

Ireland Government still committed to Sláintecare says Ca... Read More

It's clear from the comments made following the resignations that there is a lot of frustration over the slow progress of the programme so delivering key aspects in line with the yearly Action Plan and the three-year Sláintecare Implementation Strategy is a must if the Government wants to prove the whole thing isn't falling apart.

To do this the Government is working to tick some recommendations off the to-do list; the first being the announcement of three elective hospital sites in Dublin Galway and Cork next week.

Budget 2022 which will be announced on October 12th is expected to include funding to reverse the impact the pandemic has had on waiting lists after which Mr Donnelly is due to confirm a five-year plan on the elimination of these lists entirely.

However writing in The Irish Times this weekend group clinical director of the RCSI Hospital Group Prof Patrick Broe said parts of the programme are being ""cherry-picked"" so it appears targets are being met despite overall progress being slow.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFjc3IuaW4vaGVhbHRoY2FyZXMtZGlnaXRhbC10cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGlvbi13aWxsLWRlbW9jcmF0aXplcy1uYW5kYW4tbmlsZWthbmkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Healthcare’s Digital Transformation will Democratizes: Nandan Nilekani,"

India is becoming a world leader in digital transformation between sectors. In less than a decade extraordinary initiatives such as Aadhaar UPI DigiLocker CoWIN and Account Aggregator have established a guide to transformation including creating sector-specific building blocks and establishing them as “digital public goods.” I did. These products helped unleash the innovation and capital flow of the private sector focusing on the ultimate goal of providing quality service to everyone.

What is a Digital Health Mission?

The nationwide launch of the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission by Prime Minister Narendra Modi will remove the leaves from this playbook. Here are some digital public products for the healthcare sector. The vision is vast and redefines how each of us experiences medical care with doctors and hospitals. Imagine this. Patients can be enrolled with just a QR code scan and control the information shared with the hospital from their personal health records (PHRs). And after consultation PHR will be updated seamlessly. The mission employs a data empowerment and protection architecture (DEPA). This gives patients control over who and for how long they can use shared data.

The Unified Health Interface

The Unified Health Interface (UHI) proposed by the mission should help India leap into new areas of digital health services. Nowadays you can just use the UPI app to pay anyone without worrying about the app or bank you use. Similarly the vision is to use the UHI app to contact doctors make appointments make payments share health records and add prescriptions to health records. Physicians can also use the best UHI apps to help manage patient interactions digitally. Interoperability accelerates digital adoption. This will benefit Bharat as many of our health care talents are still in the city.

How is Bharat the actual thrust area?

Many elements of the mission show that it is designed for Bharat. Leverage Aadhaar authentication to enable people without a phone to obtain a health ID collect health records and provide access consent. It is good to see that the patient is in control and has a clear policy that the patient must participate voluntarily. For a successful mission all stakeholders need to identify strong incentives and use cases to participate in this journey.

The focus is on establishing strong privacy and security standards for health data in the right direction. The approach of using a federation architecture and not creating a central data store is commendable. While India’s personal data protection bill is pending the National Health Department ensures that it acts as a strong regulator and protects citizens from misuse and data breaches as data privacy policies evolve. is needed.

The principles of data minimalism should be applied and only those that are therapeutically useful should be added to the PHR. There are many technical standards and specifications in the components of this mission but it is up to the Healthtech ecosystem to address complexity and evolve simple solutions that are easy for physicians and healthcare providers to use.

How does it help the health insurance ecosystem?

The mission has announced that it will set digital standards for health insurance claim processing. This is the key to India’s journey to achieve universal health insurance. As health insurance shifts from covering only inpatient cases to comprehensive outpatient care India needs a new health insurance claim exchange that can bring greater transparency and new automated arbitrage technology. is. Only this approach can reduce the cost of processing from the current 600 rupees or more per claim to a level that supports OPD claims of only a few hundred rupees.

All of the missions are designed for high volume low cost small transaction size and are universal and easily accessible. Suitable for those who have a smartphone those who have a feature phone and those who do not have a phone. You can use either self-service or assistive services which ensures that it works in Bharat as well.

The digital public goods approach requires both time and the adoption of a strong ecosystem to be successful. UPI started in 2016 but started in 2019. The Digital Health Mission has checked all appropriate boxes for approach and architecture. (TOI)"

Esto significa que el mercado ha experimentado un retroceso del 157% en comparación con el mismo periodo del pasado año según informan desde las asociaciones de fabricantes (Anfac) concesionarios (Faconauto) y vendedores (Ganvam).

Acumulado positivo

Sin embargo no todo es negativo ya que estas organizaciones del sector también han arrojado cierto optimismo al ofrecer los datos correspondientes a los primeros nueve meses del 2021. En este sentido las matriculaciones se sitúan en las 647.995 unidades es decir un incremento del 88% con respecto al mismo periodo del ejercicio anterior. Quizás las empresas tengan mucho que ver en este aspecto ya que desde enero han matriculado 241.329 unidades lo que supone un 122% más que en el 2020 aunque el pasado mes retrocedieron un 153% con un total de 25.675 ejemplares.

En cuanto al canal de particulares el descenso experimentado en septiembre ha sido del 218% pues adquirieron un total de 28.593 automóviles cantidad que aumenta hasta las 265.322 unidades en lo que va de año es decir una caída del 112%. Por último los alquiladores aumentaron un 731% sus compras en el acumulado del año hasta el pasado mes de septiembre con un total de 141.304 ejemplares. Además en el pasado mes la cifra se situó en las 5.373 unidades por lo que este canal ha crecido un 396% más.

“Los concesionarios siguen sin tener 'stock' suficiente para atender la demanda pese a lo cual los muchos clientes se están mostrando cada vez más comprensivos con esta situación y están dispuestos a esperar por su vehículo.

Como parte de la estrategia que concibe el perfeccionamiento del comercio interior en Cuba este año se han aprobado diferentes disposiciones legales que apuntan precisamente a modernizar maneras de hacer y flexibilizar modalidades de venta.

Sin embargo aun cuando se han abierto las posibilidades legales persisten ataduras e incertidumbres que pausan el avance de tales programas ya sea por la poca divulgación o por la falta de conocimiento e interés de quienes deben implementarlos. Algunas de estas medidas se han perfeccionado a partir de las propias preocupaciones de la población.

Por ejemplo en el caso de las ventas de garaje al inicio implementadas al amparo de la Resolución 97 de 2021 a raíz de varias inquietudes la Resolución 102 derogó la anterior con el propósito de flexibilizar aún más informó recientemente Francisco Silva Herrera director general de Ventas de Mercancías del Mincin.

Una de las principales modificaciones señaló fue eliminar el requisito de solicitar un permiso para realizar estas ventas en garajes portales y otros lugares sin afectar espacios de uso común.

Destacó que la intención es que las personas puedan vender aquellos artículos que tengan en el hogar lo mismo de uso que nuevos y además ahora no requieren de una licencia comercial ni de ser trabajador por cuenta propia ya que se trata de una actividad con carácter puntual o coyuntural puntualizó.

Si bien de manera general la norma se ha ido implementando –aseveró– hay un grupo de territorios donde se ha avanzado pero en otros la divulgación de la medida no ha sido suficiente.

Por otra parte dijo a partir de la entrada en vigor de la Resolución 98 que establece los requisitos para acceder a las ventas a plazo se han habilitado hasta la fecha 59 establecimientos con esta modalidad en el país con mayor presencia en Matanzas Sancti Spíritus y Las Tunas.

En este caso la propia norma define cuáles son las mercancías que pueden venderse a plazos: muebles colchones equipos electrodomésticos bicicletas y otros artículos industriales y siempre con un valor superior a 2 500 pesos.

Con el objetivo de expandir estas facilidades de venta se han establecido también convenios con otras formas de gestión artesanos el Fondo de Bienes Culturales etc. para así situar esas producciones –mediante contrato– en los mercados industriales acotó.

CASAS COMISIONISTAS Y GESTIÓN DE INVENTARIOS

Respecto a las casas comisionistas una modalidad que tradicionalmente se desarrolló en Cuba pero que luego de un tiempo dejó de tener vigencia Silva Herrera resaltó que este año también se aprobó la Resolución 83 que busca revitalizar tal prestación.

«A principios de 2021 teníamos 62 establecimientos en el país que realizaban esta gestión de venta y luego de aprobada la disposición en junio ya contamos con 211 unidades».

Entre ellas precisó 15 tiendas destinadas totalmente a ello y 196 departamentos ubicados dentro de otros mercados de artículos industriales; en tanto en el último mes se han realizado transacciones por más de dos millones de pesos.

En relación con los inventarios la viceministra del Comercio Interior Grisel Ávila Díaz explicó que en 2020 se aprobó el Decreto No. 29 dirigido a reducir al mínimo posible los niveles de existencia y en tal sentido flexibilizar y dar autonomía al sistema empresarial para comercializar los inventarios dentro y fuera del sistema. Añadió que ahora se pueden comercializar a través de la red de comercio entiéndase mercados industriales casas comisionistas etc.

Sin embargo alegó ha transcurrido más de un año desde la aprobación del decreto y siguen siendo altos los inventarios y por otra parte resulta insuficiente la gestión que realiza el sistema empresarial en materia de lento movimiento y ociosos.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjNkanVlZ29zcGMuY29tL21tby9uZXctd29ybGQtYXJyYXNhLXZlbnRhcy1zdGVhbS1tbW8tYW1hem9uLWdhbWVzLWFwZXJlY2UtNC1wdWVzdG9zLXRvcC0xMC1zZW1hbmHSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy4zZGp1ZWdvc3BjLmNvbS9tbW8vbmV3LXdvcmxkLWFycmFzYS12ZW50YXMtc3RlYW0tbW1vLWFtYXpvbi1nYW1lcy1hcGVyZWNlLTQtcHVlc3Rvcy10b3AtMTAtc2VtYW5hL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New World arrasa en ventas en Steam: el MMO de Amazon Games aparece en 4 puestos del Top 10 de la semana,"El lanzamiento de New World está siendo un éxito y más de un millón de jugadores se aventuraron a probar el MMO de Amazon Games en el día de salida.

HERMOSILLO SON.- A pesar de que toda la mercancía ha subido de precio los vendedores de flores tienen altas expectativas en cuanto a la venta de sus productos para estas festividades de día de muertos.

Algunos locatarios ya llevan 15 días en sus locales unos se adelantaron desde hace un mes y medio para evitar la competencia con otros vendedores tanto en preferencia como en precio.

“ Parece que ahí va saliendo el año pasado estuvo un poco calmado por lo que vemos ahora va bien ” comenta Susana vendedora de flores.

Los comerciantes aseguran que este año ha habido un poco más de movimiento los precios los fijan de acuerdo a como lo ven con los otros vendedores para quitarse de la competencia de esta manera van variando ya que los precios del año pasado no son los mismos que este.

Entre el producto que más se le vende está el aro el ramo flores artificiales la dalia el girasol los listones entre otra mercancía alusiva a esta festividad. La señora Susana explica que todo ha subido mínimo un peso y por consecuencia ellos también le suben a la mercancía sus precios varían entre 27 y 30 pesos por lo que no hay promociones ni rebajas.

A partir del 15 de este mes confían que sus ventas suban pero están en espera de sacar los permisos para poder vender en la vía pública aguardan a que les den resolución dentro de dos semanas aproximadamente.

Después del 2 de noviembre los vendedores se comenzarán a retirar ya que aseguran; “No tiene caso seguir con la mercancía” y así la guardan para el siguiente año."

We tested if it really works,"Everyone’s been there: The latest Marvel film trailer is out or Kanye surprise-dropped a record but all you have are the tinny-sounding little speakers on your smartphone and a handful of friends itching to listen in. While many of us have quality speakers or headphones at home those devices aren’t always handy. And even if they do feature interesting software features (like AirPods or Sony’s flagship headphones) it doesn’t always translate to all source audio or every device.

Verizon is setting out to change that — to equalize the audio space by partnering with nerdy audio startup Boomcloud 360. Currently pilot testing on a small handful of phones with more to come later Verizon’s Adaptive Sound brings the concept of tailored virtual surround audio to your Android phone’s OS level. If Verizon’s promise holds true it means you can mold all of the audio that passes through your phone onto any connected device without the need for proprietary apps.

Sound too good to be true? I got in touch with Verizon and Boomcloud 360 for a behind-the-scenes look and here’s how it works.

How you hear sound

Before analyzing any virtual surround sound it’s important to learn a bit more about how we hear as human beings. “How do we know when a car goes from left to right as it’s passing by?” says Paul Riker VP of User Experience at BoomCloud360. “And more specifically how do we know when it’s really far left and then really far right.” It turns out the science of spatial audio is pretty hard to nail down.

When we position a sound in our real world we use factors like its volume spectral makeup (how much treble versus how much bass for instance) and how it interacts with the environment. When you turn your head that whole equation changes in real time. While many tech companies aim to offer virtual surround sound many fail to keep the integrity of the source sound because so many variables change. In short it’s not just about “more bass” or pure gimmicks like virtual surround sound.

Is this similar to Apple’s spatial audio?

Apple has made waves with its lauded Transparency mode. Using multiple outboard microphones Apple’s pro-level AirPods products compile a surround-style image of what’s going on around you. But this is done strictly on the headphones themselves and it’ll work with compatible AidPods product (either the AirPods Pro or the AirPods Max). It’s worth noting that many headphones support this technology not just Apple though some of the routes they take to get there can be a bit different.

So what does it look like when trying to provide nuanced three-dimensional sound for Spotify singles? What about a Netflix show? What if you’re listening on a cheap Bluetooth speaker you bought on Amazon? Painting an immersive image and polished EQ onto the audio already passing through your phone — in the onboard speakers Bluetooth devices or even your car’s stereo — is Verizon Adaptive Sound’s main focus. But determining whether this is marketing jargon or the real deal is another thing entirely.

Going high-fidelity without losing integrity

While I’m not a research expert or audiologist I have a fairly deep background on how sound works and how music merges with technology (the title of my Bachelors’s degree is literally Music Technology). On the phone with Riker from Boomcloud 360 I wanted to press him on some of the science behind the goals of Verizon Adaptive Sound.

“The first thing that governs our approach to this technology is: Do no harm” says Riker. “We’ve developed a way to dynamically optimize and tune the sound experience all while ensuring we maintain the integrity of the original sound file.”

How research and partnerships bring the sound to your phone

The researchers behind Verizon Adaptive Sound — pros with backgrounds in audiology mathematics statistics spatial audio  etc. — use existing papers and studies while also producing their own IP to nail down algorithms and sonic treatments with more than 70 patents to give you in theory a better sound stage — all without undercutting any part of the sound. In fact one of the founders of Boomcloud 360 spent years studying the merger between sound science and consumer tech at DTS. In short they’ve brought in the big guns.

So does it actually work?

To be fair Riker and his team knew I’d be skeptical when they were giving me more info over the phone. “We lead with the default tuning that we think will provide the best experience” says Riker. “But we’re well aware that people have specific preferences and want more control. And we’re confident enough in this technology that we give you the power to adjust sliders EQs and more all to tailor your sound.”

Sometimes [Verizon Adaptive Sound] really brings out parts of the music you never hear.

I spent about a week putting this new software to the test across a lot of different applications. Right now the Moto Edge+ is one of the only devices that has the tech built-in and I tried everything I could think of to see if Verizon Adaptive Sound improves the audio experience. First I used headphones of all types — from Bluetooth flagships like the Sony WH-1000XM4s I use for most audio and mid-range IEMs like the Shure SE425. This is the scenario that really shines. Without VAS enabled the sound is one-dimensional: Good but nothing new. When VAS is turned on it adds a feeling of space to your music or YouTube video. Sometimes this is overkill but sometimes this really brings out parts of the music you never hear like room mics on a drum set or some mid-range nuance in the vocal track.

But headphones aren’t the only application. The point here is to use this technology across all your connected audio devices. While I did notice a slight difference when listening to audio over the Edge+’s tiny onboard speakers I’m not so sure the average listener would get much value. One noted improvement was on my tiny JBL Bluetooth speaker while sitting out on my porch. Normally though loud this particular speaker provides a markedly narrow sound. With VAS enabled it felt like I had two speakers even when I was listening off-access. What’s more the tech didn’t change the volume or bass/treble makeup of the sound. It just added nuance. I even found a mild improvement on Bluetooth-connected car stereo with podcasts Spotify and more.

I even found a mild improvement on Bluetooth-connected car stereo with podcasts Spotify and more.

The other point of testing I wanted to get clear on was — as I noted above — how does this compare to the AirPods’ impressive transparency mode? In short these really are two different things. Apple aims to physically position the location of your “source audio” device giving you an accurate point of sound depending on where your laptop phone or tablet is. This is really immersive when consuming content but it’s also helpful for realism during phone calls and FaceTime sessions. VAS doesn’t feel quite as dynamic as this. Instead it seems particularly focused on giving you rich audio that while still immersive doesn’t factor in your physical movements or the tilt of your head.

A final note on quality is this: Your VAS mileage will vary. Different speakers headphones  and sound systems all have different thresholds for improvement. Your extremely nice speakers might pick up some value while your cheap $30 earbuds might not become something they aren’t. My personal take is if the tech is available to you turning it on (or allowing it to auto-mold your sound using its source detection technology) won’t hurt and will in some cases improve your listening experience.

Coming to a phone near you hopefully

The most important part of this story is how VAS gets to you. Verizon’s goal is to provide something that won’t require consumers to buy specialized headphones or lock themselves into a single-device app. Ironically right now the technology is not on very many phones so you do have to buy a specific smartphone to get in on it. “Our hope is to get this into as many Verizon phones and devices as possible no matter what manufacturer makes those devices” says George Koroneos a Verizon spokesperson. “We aren’t there yet but because we want this technology to be turnkey and accessible we’re having a lot of conversations with a lot of smartphone brands.”

In essence how you get access to VAS is through your Verizon smartphone at the moment. Should you drop your current phone and go buy a Moto Edge+ just for this? Well probably not. The Edge+ is a solid flagship phone and VAS is really cool but it’s not a must-buy. It’s sort of the cherry on top; a cool thing to have that will undoubtedly bring your music and video consumption to a new level.

But whether the audio revolution Verizon is hoping for actually happens depends almost entirely on one thing: Will Samsung Google HMD and the rest of the consumer tech giants be willing to bring it to their phones? Time will tell but I’ll be here listening when it does.

THOR was built to operate under any network in any environment from dense forests during wildfires to remote military settings.

“At Marine Corps Air Station Miramar this week we demonstrated THOR’s ability to enable a fully-operational 5G network that allowed: autonomous robot communication to a self-driving battery delivery vehicle video streaming between people and vehicles in the field data from sensors on devices operating in an austere environment and 5G mobile edge computing being used to help decision-makers by providing a single operating picture of all of these data feeds in real-time” Director of Verizon 5G Labs Christian Guirnalda explained Friday.

Guirnalda and Director of Verizon Response and Public Safety Operations Cory Davis briefed Nextgov on the prototype and its potential impact across the defense and first response landscapes.

Almost a year ago Verizon and the Marine Corps unveiled their experimental testbed at MCAS Miramar to strategically explore fifth-generation wireless technologies’ potential to support the Pentagon’s pursuits. It marked Verizon’s first-ever 5g Ultra Wideband service deployment on a military base. For DOD it’s a chance to grow its insiders’ grasp of what the next-level technology is capable of and mature their understanding of how they can best put it to use.

“The first military base with 5G in the United States has seized the opportunity to bring together industry partners and stakeholders across the base to collaborate in new ways and accelerate innovation in their key areas of focus” Guirnalda said.

Also a first- and one-of-a-kind THOR is a prototype 5G-based disaster response and command hub vehicle—and there are no present plans to build another. It has modular private 5G and edge computing architecture at its core. Davis confirmed it’s designed to be National Incident Management System or NIMS-1 compliant and offers full radio interoperability and onboard Joint Operations Center services. In addition it provides what he referred to as “a multitude of connectivity options” spanning private 5G commercial 4G LTE Land Mobile Radio and tactical radio wireless networking microwave mesh and more—together in one package. Other components include 4G/5G radios a rear command center a camera a 6-seat cabin and an exterior touch screen display.

Davis noted it’s also equipped with a tethered drone to capture an aerial view “that can be fed over the network to devices on the ground and the command center below potentially helping those in public safety or the military with risk and damage assessment situational awareness or search and rescue operations.”

“THOR is a bit like a Swiss-Army-Knife on wheels” he added.

Although 5G technology is more accessible than it has ever been Davis said in some cases there remains an opportunity “to boost the network and technological capabilities” of first responders and the U.S. military.

“In situations ranging from fighting wildfires in forests where network connections and coverage can be challenging to the devastation and infrastructure damage caused by earthquakes public safety professionals face the potential of coverage and technology gaps or an out-of-service network” Davis noted.

But Verizon built the futuristic vehicle to confront those challenges. “In a field where seconds always matter and lives are on the line connectivity and reliability matter” he added.

THOR consists of the “full menu” of emerging and existing tech solutions. But Davis said future iterations for public safety or the military could potentially go “a la carte.”

“In other words these Verizon Frontline services can be delivered in a number of different configurations” he explained.

Guirnalda added that THOR is essentially a proxy for the systems implemented with the 5G commercial network in California.

“The 5G network and 5G Edge our mobile edge computing platform will allow the same capabilities offered by THOR to provide permanent transformation at MCAS Miramar” he said. “Energy management and resilience EV and autonomous vehicles and supply chains as well as base services to families will all be enabled further with 5G.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ29iZWFycy5jb20vbmV3cy9ob3ctdG8td2F0Y2gtbGlzdGVuLXRvLWJlYXJzLWxpb25zLWdhbWUtdHYtcmFkaW8tb25saW5lLXN0cmVhbS0yMDIxLXdlZWstNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to watch Chicago Bears vs. Detroit Lions | TV radio watch online live streaming 2021 Week 4,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vYmlsZXdvcmxkbGl2ZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZWQtY29udGVudC90b3AtdGhyZWUvYXR0LXJpbmdzLXRoZS1jaGFuZ2VzLWZvci1lbnRlcnByaXNlLWN1c3RvbWVycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AT&T partners with RingCentral,"AT&T has partnered with RingCentral to digitise business wireline phone services stating the move will boost security and reduce costs for its enterprise customers.

RingCentral provides cloud-based unified communications service which AT&T is making available to businesses nationwide through a new service called AT&T for Business – Advanced. In a statement the operator highlighted the benefits of combining cloud-based functionality with the reliability of traditional wireline phone service.

AT&T and RingCentral will use hardware made by DataRemote to digitise analog traffic so that it can be transmitted by VoIP networks. In addition AT&T said the device can provide 12 hours of operation using an internal battery backup in the event of a power failure.

AT&T noted the new service can increase reliability for a number of wireline services in addition to voice such as alarms elevators fax machines modems point-of-sale terminals and even healthcare equipment.

Nationwide businesses using wireline phones often need to pay separate phone bills in each state due to regional regulations AT&T noted. This solution can consolidate all lines onto one bill the operator explained.

AT&T is the second major mobile operator in the US to partner with RingCentral. In May Verizon announced plans to combine RingCentral’s cloud-based messaging video and phone service with Verizon’s 5G mobile edge computing SD WAN and security services."

How materials are fed into the process is another significant difference between batch and continuous processes. In CM loss-in-weight twin-screw feeders can be used to accurately dose raw materials as a continuous feedstream. “In a loss-in-weight feeder the amount of weight lost is measured by means of a scale and sent back to the controller which adjusts the speed of the screws to maintain a constant mass flow output” explains Sharon Nowak business development manager at Coperion K-Tron for Food & Pharmaceutical Industries.

When a CM process is up and running in-line quality control measurements and process control systems with feedback loops can reduce the amount of out-of-specification product and improve quality. Training operators to understand the differences between batch and CM operation is one challenge. “One has to get used to the fact that most quality control of intermediate is running in-line or at-line and that stopping a running CM line should be [avoided]. Sometimes it is better to discharge a few-hundred grams of product [rather than] an intermediate stop of the whole line” notes Meier.

For example Meier says that Bohle worked closely with a large German manufacturer of generic drug products to adapt a high-shear batch granulation process to continuous wet granulation and drying. The manufacturer was able to make product for the market within a few months after factory acceptance testing says Meier.

Meier suggests that especially for companies with limited personnel resources adopting a wet granulation process from powder to milled granules can be a good starting point for using CM and can be used to demonstrate the benefits of CM to stakeholders. “[Wet granulation] is easily controllable; it can be adopted quickly from already existing high-shear granulation processes and formulations and [the company] can generate their first experience in continuous production.”

“Continuous wet granulation drying and milling equipment is already producing marketed products in Germany” reports Robin Meier manager of scientific operations at L.B. Bohle GmbH. “We also currently have a complete [powder to coated tablet] system being built right now with factory acceptance testing planned for 2022.”

Modular CM equipment is available from multiple suppliers. Glatt’s MODCOS modular platform offers continuous processing beginning with powder feeding of API and excipients through coated tablets with the addition of the Driam continuous Driaconti-T system for tablet coating added in 2018 (5).

Commercially available CM equipment lines include entire systems as well as specific unit operations. GEA for example announced in June 2020 that it is making its well-established ConsiGma portfolio of CM equipment more accessible by allowing integration with third-party equipment and by defining ConsiGma 4.0 modules for individual unit operations (4). Standardized “off-the-shelf” elements also make CM equipment more affordable for a wider range of users.

Processes that are integrated to run continuously from powder to tablet have now been running commercially for more than five years with the first oral solid-dosage drug made using continuous processing approved by FDA in 2015 (3). Since then drug manufacturers equipment suppliers contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) and consortiums of industry and academia have continued to innovate solutions to challenges such as equipment cleanability and better control of raw material feeders.

Continuous manufacturing (CM) has the potential to create higher quality drug substances and drug products with greater flexibility in batch size and with a smaller facility footprint. The definition of what pharmaceutical manufacturers and regulators consider a “continuous process” is broad. The International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Q13 draft guidance which was released for public consultation July 27 2021 gives examples of three concepts of CM: a combination or hybrid approach in which some unit operations run in batch mode while others are connected and run in a continuous manner; a process that makes either a drug substance or a drug product with all unit operations integrated and running continuously; and an approach that connects both drug substance and drug product in an end-to-end continuous process (1). The industry is making advances in all these methods even the fully end-to-end system with Continuus Pharmaceuticals receiving US-government funding in January 2021 to bring the company’s Integrated Continuous Manufacturing technology to commercial scale (2).

“The accuracy of feed is very much dependent upon screw fill” continues Nowak. “Therefore it is imperative that the material not only flow within the feeder hopper but also be entrained by the screws” she explains. A challenge however is that some APIs and excipients do not flow easily and can be held up in the feed hopper. Developments in more flowable or coprocessed ingredients are one way to relieve flow issues and equipment solutions are another.

Coperion K-Tron’s “smart” vibration device the ActiFlow monitors the loss-in-weight signal on the feeder controller; if there is an interruption in material flow a vibration device is activated on the feed hopper to restart flow. “More importantly this device is tied directly into the feeder’s control system and learns at what point in the process the material tends to bridge (due to changes in the feeder screw speed or feed factors). The ActiFlow proactively starts before the problem even occurs and then it backs off on the vibration when the loss-in-weight signal is back in specification” explains Nowak.

Equipment providers continue to improve digital load cell and feeder controls technology. For example Coperion K-Tron’s newest load cells combined with the company’s new KCM-III controller have increased resolution to allow faster reaction time which improves accuracy especially at low feed rates and during setpoint changes or after a refill says Nowak. “The refill reaction time is critical to maintaining overall accuracy in the continuous process” she notes. The newest version of the controller also increases processing power and data storage capacity. These features are important for traceability and for tracking data trends. In the future Nowak says accelerometers could be used within the control system to accurately measure vibration and effects on feeder output thus further increasing accuracy of control systems.

Another consideration for CM feeders is that users need equipment for very small feed rates in the range of 10–100 g/h as well as feeders designed for feed rates higher than 25–50 kg/h says Nowak. “Coperion K-Tron has developed specific modular design feeders to handle a wider range of feed rate profiles. The use of specialty servo motors for example has widened the screw speed ranges available with much higher turndowns thus eliminating the requirements for changing gearboxes when higher or lower rate ranges are required.”

While this design allows higher rate ranges without a gearbox change Nowak notes that the company’s QT model of feeders also uses a modular design which is another advance that can facilitate quick changeovers in equipment. The overall designs which include an option for quick roll-out frames on rails have improved accessibility added versatility and minimized downtime says Nowak.

“The QT model was specifically designed because of polling many of our key customers who were currently working in continuous processing including continuous direct compression continuous extrusion and granulation and continuous coating” says Nowak. “The new QT includes interchangeable modules that can be completely removed from the feeder motor/gearbox to change from one model to another. This allows the operator to easily remove everything in contact with the product in a few seconds and replace with either a new module or a different feeder model.”

Quick-change designs are also helpful for improving cleanability which is a key area targeted for improvement by those involved in CM. Nowak says that Coperion KTron’s new designs have improved connections upstream and downstream of the feeder; fewer parts make assembly easier and faster. “Turntables and rails allow the feeder to be rolled back and turned 90 degrees from the feeder ‘cluster’ thus making access to change-out screws or perform other maintenance much easier” says Nowak. “The feeder is also automatically pitched 2 degrees for drainage to allow for quick wash-in-place operations.”

Equipment integration

Integration is another challenge for continuous processes particularly when connecting equipment from different original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for different pieces. “Many end users wish to remain with their existing known unit technology” says Nowak so communication between the unit operations is key. Nowak notes that increasingly OEMs and drug manufacturers are using OPC-UA as a common language. To make sure communication is clear and that the required parameters can be transmitted Coperion K-Tron has partnered with several continuous systems integrators such as Continua Process Systems to ensure that communication and data collection of the complete process is seamless says Nowak. The company’s KCM-III controller is equipped with communication cards and options for multiple protocols (e.g. Ethernet Modbus OPC-UA) so communication and integration into the overall process is maintained she notes.

PAT

Another area where innovations are expected to continue is in process analytical technology (PAT) tools. Newer and better sensors that are faster and more precise are driving evolution in PAT said Fernando Muzzio in an interview with Pharmaceutical Technology (6). PAT is a crucial part of enabling in-line process control in continuous manufacturing and companies are working on further developments in using PAT for quality control including real-time release. Process modeling is a key part of developing real-time quality control said Muzzio. For example residence time distribution models are being explored for use in predicting content uniformity in the final blend and finished product as a function of measured perturbations of ingredients coming into the line.

Partnerships between industry automation solutions providers and academia will help the ongoing progress in PAT added Bikash Chatterjee CEO of Pharmatech Associates a USP company in an interview with Pharmaceutical Technology (6). “We are in an asymptotic rise in terms of our ability to understand what’s happening in our processes. We need to now extend that out of the lab and put it on the shop floor so that we are making product that we know is consistently good. That’s going to benefit everyone not just patients but manufacturers as well” said Chatterjee.

Enabling adoption

Innovations such as these equipment improvements along with developments in control systems and materials will assist solid-dosage drug manufacturers—from branded to over-the-counter and generic drugs—as they move ahead with adoption of continuous processes.

The Center for Antiracist Research held a star-studded symposium on Friday at the George Sherman Union Metcalf Hall. Among the speakers were Rochelle Walensky Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director; Marcella Nunez-Smith chair of the presidential COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force; Reshma Kewalramani Vertex CEO and president (a BU alum); Boston Mayor Kim Janey and of course the center’s founding director Ibram X. Kendi. Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) was scheduled to speak but she was called away at the last minute to meet with President Biden.

The symposium What the Science Tells Us: Racial and Health Inequities During the Pandemic was the first large-scale public event held by the center since it launched in June 2020 and was supported by its founding partner the Vertex Foundation. The message from virtually all the speakers who included BU public health science and economics researchers as well as public and private sector health leaders was consistent: when it comes to racial and health inequities in this country the time for documenting and debating the problem is past. Now is the time for finding solutions.

“I don’t want to document the problem anymore” Walensky said. “We know we have a problem. We need to start looking at interventions to fix the problem.”

Kendi BU’s Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities and a College of Arts & Sciences professor of history echoed Walensky—and the mission statement with which the launched the Center for Antiracist Research at BU. “We have to get to a point in which we’re trying out big bold solutions to seemingly intractable racial problems” said Kendi who just three days earlier was awarded a MacArthur “genius” fellowship in recognition of his contributions—and promise—toward the betterment of humankind. “We have to move from a period of awareness to action. That’s what we’re trying to do at our center that’s what’s happening at the CDC.”

BU President Robert A. Brown took the stage as well welcoming the more than 1000 attendees (roughly 150 people were in the GSU audience while nearly 900 tuned in from around the country). Congratulating him for his MacArthur fellowship Brown introduced Kendi who moderated the first panel on racial health and economic equity with speakers Nunez-Smith Peter Slavin former president of Massachusetts General Hospital and Thea James a BU School of Medicine associate professor of emergency medicine and Boston Medical Center associate chief medical officer.

The first speakers and those on subsequent panels reflected the shift in conversation since the onset of the pandemic more than 18 months ago: the call by Kendi and others who were once considered outsiders to address the racial inequities behind the pandemic and beyond is now being taken up at the highest levels of government.

“COVID-19 we know took advantage of what were preexisting structural inequities” Nunez-Smith told the audience. “We’ve all had a collective witnessing to that in the past 18 plus months and we cannot unsee what we have all seen… And that disproportionate burden—I long for the day when I don’t use that [term] anymore when we can finally disrupt the predictability of who is always harmed first and who is harmed worse.”

Equity is one of the core principles of the Biden administration said Nunez-Smith who is also senior advisor to the White House COVID-19 Response Team. She reminded the audience that among the executive orders Biden signed on his first day in office was the one creating the COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force. “And that was expressly saying that we bring together voices inside and outside the US government to come up with recommendations to mitigate those inequities now and to create resilience so we don’t see these inequities in future pandemics” she said. “The task force holds as its north star: what are the systemic problems what are the systemic solutions?”

During the keynote panel—which was to have included Pressley—Kewalramani (CAS’98 MED’98) asked Walensky about a recent bill introduced by Pressley along with US Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) that would establish a national center for antiracism on health within the CDC. Walensky said she looked forward to partnering with Pressley and the other bill sponsors.

“When I came in we declared that racism is a serious public health threat” Walensky said. Her team has created a core strategy “that cultivates comprehensive health equity science optimizes interventions reinforces and expands robust partnerships and enhances capacity and workforce engagement” she said. “I’ve said that we need to weave health equity into everything that we do in every center across the CDC in everything in health.”

Last spring Walensky said she called for proposals from across the CDC for ways to address racial health inequities within a one-year period. More than 150 proposals have poured in and are being vetted now she said. “We’re going to establish the science. Some things will work some won’t. We’re going to learn. Everyone’s been energized everyone wants to do this.”

Among other points made by the symposium speakers:

When it comes to health outcomes your zip code matters more than your genetic code. “Where you live where you get care the overwhelming thing that drives outcomes are social—things that are the legacies of unintentional policies” said Nunez-Smith.

Walensky recalled sending patients home with a prescription in Baltimore in the 1990s during the height of the AIDS crisis. “They come back several days later and you say ‘Why are you back?’ They say they couldn’t get their prescription filled. Fast forward to now with COVID we sent people home and told them to quarantine. What became very clear was that the word quarantine is a privilege. Not everyone could quarantine.”

A “data revolution” is needed. “The data [on racial and ethnic health disparities] hasn’t been there because even when they started releasing data some states only had 20 to 30 percent of the data” Walensky said. “If we can’t measure it we can’t improve it. We’ve been working very hard over the past months to measure it.” And Nunez-Smith said: “We need data that makes everyone visible that focuses on lived experience as we try to make equitable decisions.”

The telehealth care that was widely touted as the future during the pandemic revealed a modern-day version of the redlining that created segregated neighborhoods and prevented Black people from accumulating wealth: digital redlining as one speaker Jayakanth Srinivasan a Questrom School of Business research associate professor and a system analysis and health system transformation expert termed it. Not everyone has reliable access to the internet or understands the complexities of Zoom and how to safeguard their privacy.

Because of the cost of broadband access people with limited resources have to choose between spending their cell phone minutes on their children’s Zoom schooling or on telehealth appointments Srinivasan said during a panel on the impact of redlining on racial health inequities: “I fundamentally believe we have to make broadband health care a requirement. In the richest country in the world we’re telling people to make choices about broadband access between health and education?” Boston Medical Center designed a system to improve access to telehealth he said. “We see significantly different adoption of telehealth. The lived experience matters. The place and space matter.”

Listen to people in the community and meet them where they are. Boston dramatically improved vaccination rates among Black and Latinx people Janey said by providing vaccines—and reliable information—in senior centers and public housing and at neighborhood festivals. “Mattapan had low vaccination rates so we launched Mattapan Cares” said Janey who gave a shout-out to her father the late Clifford Janey (Wheelock’84) as a BU alum. People who were trusted in the neighborhood who’d been vaccinated themselves knocked on doors she said. “We met with faith leaders civic groups. We worked with Haitian leaders in that area to make sure we were getting the information out on indoor mask mandates employee vaccination verification programs making sure we were doing everything to slow the spread of the virus.”

It’s important to measure racial health disparities within age groups. Recent research shows that among those under 65 people who are Black and Latinx died during the pandemic at three to five times the rate of those who are white while indigenous peoples died at up to 19 times the rate of whites said panel speaker Julia Raifman a School of Public Health assistant professor of health law policy and management.

The chair of the symposium was Monica Wang Center for Antiracist Research associate director of narrative and an SPH associate professor of community health sciences.

“I want to highlight emphasize underscore the word community” Kendi said. “And one way we should understand the word community is in the sense of building community health.

“Hopefully we’ve learned from the pandemic how interconnected our health is. That’s how we’ll be able to build and support policies that are beneficial for the community and to be less concerned for the individual from the standpoint of that person’s ability or freedom to wear a mask. I’m sorry but it should be about the community.

“People are increasingly recognizing that climate change is an existential threat to our existence that pandemics are an existential threat but we should also recognize that racism is an existential threat. People are being degraded because of the color of their skin but most importantly people are getting sick people are dying.”

Then with a sheepish smile he said “Okay I’ll get off my soapbox now.” The attendees in the auditorium gave him a warm round of applause.

In his closing remarks Kendi addressed the audience at the GSU as well as online: “I want to encourage everyone to be constantly thinking: how can we solve this problem and come up with solutions to eliminate racial health disparities?

“If we’re not going to be bold” he said “we’re going to pass this on to our children and our children’s children—and they’re going to be very upset with us.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2NoZXZyb24tY2xvc2VzLWp2LXdpdGgtbWVyY3VyaWEtdG8tYnV5LWFtZXJpY2FuLW5hdHVyYWwtZ2Fz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chevron Closes JV With Mercuria to Buy American Natural Gas,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/chevron-closes-jv-with-mercuria-to-buy-american-natural-gas on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2NoZXZyb24tY2xvc2VzLWp2LXdpdGgtbWVyY3VyaWEtdG8tYnV5LWFtZXJpY2FuLW5hdHVyYWwtZ2Fz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

The company has entered into a business transfer agreement with Mylan Pharmaceuticals to transfer certain primarily off-patent branded and generic established medicines (Upjohn business) as a going concern to Mylan for a consideration of Rs 180.48 crore Pfizer Ltd said in a regulatory filing.

The consideration for the transfer is supported by valuation reports issued by two independent valuers it added.

""The Upjohn Business comprises six brands which include Lyrica Viagra Celebrex Amlogard Daxid and Dilantin. These along with related business assets and liabilities will transition to Mylan"" the filing said.

The rationale for the transaction is that Pfizer Inc USA on July 29 2019 announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to combine its Upjohn business -- which consists of off-patented branded and generic established medicines -- with Mylan N.V. thereby creating a new global pharmaceutical company Viatris Inc.

The global transaction was closed in November 2020.

Under the global transaction six brands currently marketed by Pfizer Ltd in India viz. Lyrica Viagra Celebrex Amlogard Daxid and Dilantin will transition to Mylan Pharmaceuticals.

The transaction in India will be closed upon receipt of regulatory approvals Pfizer Ltd said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In a burst of multibillion-dollar deals Las Vegas has seen investors pay mountains of money the past few years to own high-profile casino-resorts.

Those sales have also shown what casino operators — well one in particular — are willing to pay to rent these properties.

MGM Resorts International has reached deals since fall 2019 to lease Bellagio MGM Grand Mandalay Bay Aria Vdara and as announced this week The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.

Its initial annual rent ranges from $200 million for The Cosmopolitan to $292 million for MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay.

All but one of the deals involved sale-leasebacks that netted MGM a fortune in proceeds including more than $4 billion for Bellagio alone. Moreover all of the deals involved the same company on the other side of the table New York financial giant Blackstone which has been gobbling up real estate in Southern Nevada for years.

Still the nine-figure rental rates show what MGM is willing to pay to keep running its properties and to take over another towering resort on the Strip The Cosmopolitan without buying its real estate.

A landlord and tenant determine a casino-resort’s rental rate based on a property’s earnings stability market and possible corporate guarantee according to Truist Securities analyst Barry Jonas.

When MGM announced in July that it was selling Aria and Vdara to Blackstone for nearly $3.9 billion in cash and renting them back it noted the sales price was a little over 18 times its rent which initially is $215 million a year.

At the time Tyler Henritze head of real estate acquisitions in the Americas for Blackstone said such deals were attractive for several reasons including “long-term leases with stable cash flows and no capital expenditure obligations and in this case a full corporate guaranty of rent payments from a best-in-class operator.”

After Blackstone purchased multiple MGM-operated properties on the Strip it’s now selling The Cosmopolitan for $5.65 billion. As part of the deal MGM is acquiring the resort’s operations side for more than $1.6 billion and leasing the property from a group of owners.

MGM did not respond to a request for comment Friday on its rental rates.

The casino chain has made a fortune selling its real estate as part of its “asset-light” strategy though as with any deal there are risks to leasing a resort rather than owning the property outright.

Jonas for one noted there is a “finality” to selling a building and losing control over it.

Plus as Macquarie Capital analyst Chad Beynon pointed out tenants “always owe that rent” and have to set aside money every year to pay their landlord.

Even after the coronavirus pandemic sparked catastrophic job losses and led to nationwide casino closures turning the Strip into a ghost town for a while casino landlords came out OK.

One major landlord is now buying another in a $17 billion-plus deal.

Caesars Entertainment spinoff Vici Properties announced in August that it was acquiring MGM Resorts spinoff MGM Growth Properties putting real estate ownership of many of Las Vegas’ biggest hotel-casinos under one company.

After the deal was announced Vici chief executive Edward Pitoniak said the two casino landlords had collected “100 percent of our rent so far through COVID on time and in cash.”

The plant-based meat company began selling frozen products to Walmart in 2015. In the past five years Walmart extended its Beyond Meat line from the patties to now include Beyond Sausage and Beyond Breakfast Sausage.

“We are thrilled by the continued growth with Walmart and the opportunity to offer Walmart customers increased accessibility to a larger selection of our delicious and better-for-you plant-based products” said Chuck Muth chief growth officer Beyond Meat. “As more households continue to buy our products and buy them more frequently we’re excited to satisfy the growing demand through increased product offerings and distribution.”

The company also said that the Cookout Classic will now be a permanent item offered to customers.

Beyond Meat binds plant-based proteins fats and minerals to create a structure similar to beef or pork. The company uses no gluten soy or bioengineered ingredients in its products.

The company also recently doubled its retail distribution for Beyond Breakfast Sausage which includes Walmart. Beyond Meat said it is currently in about 28000 retail locations in the United States.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vYmVzdGxpZmVvbmxpbmUuY29tL3dhbG1hcnQtbGF5YXdheS1vdXRyYWdlLW5ld3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart Shoppers Are Outraged the Store Is Getting Rid of This,"We all know there's no more exciting shopping time than the holidays but it's also the most expensive. According to the National Retail Federation the average person in the U.S. spends about $1000 during the holiday season and most of us are looking to find ways to curb those costs. Walmart which is known for its low prices as is has long had sales programs and policies that help customers get the most bang for their buck especially during the holidays.

In the past 18 months the company has made some changes to adjust to the new needs of its shoppers from delivery programs to subscription services and Walmart's latest move hasn't gone over so well with its loyal customers. Read on to find out what Walmart is getting rid of that is poised to change holiday shopping forever.

RELATED: Walmart Is the Worst Place to Buy This Customers Say in New Survey.

Walmart has gotten rid of its traditional layaway program.

Walmart has officially gotten rid of its traditional layaway service ahead of the 2021 holiday shopping season replacing it with a new buy-now-pay-later option via Affirm. The retailer is advertising this financing service as ""an alternative to layaway"" so customers can pay over time and set a paced amount of their choosing. According to Walmart approved customers can finance their order over the course of three to 24 months depending on the cost of the items. Only certain types of items are eligible and they must range from $144 to $2000 including tax.

""Last holiday season we removed seasonal layaway from most of our stores with the exception of select jewelry items at select stores and based on what we learned we are confident that our payment options provide the right solutions for our customers"" Walmart said in a statement.

There are some key differences between layaway and the Affirm payment plan.

Unlike Walmart's previous layaway service Affirm includes a finance charge which may be an annual percentage rate (APR) of anywhere between 10 to 30 percent based on credit—which makes it a difficult option for many people who do not have credit or have bad credit. Others may also be ineligible if their bank is not connected to Affirm.

Walmart's decision to get rid of layaway and replace it with Affirm's payment plan has not gone over well with all of its customers. ""This is a huge blow to working poor people"" one reporter tweeted garnering more than 200 likes. ""Layaway is how we get things when we do not have credit. It is how parents buy clothes and gifts for their kids or how folks buy big ticket items. If we had credit we wouldn't need layaway. Walmart just gutted so many families' dreams.""

Walmart shoppers are upset over the retailer's switch with some saying it's ruined the holidays for low-income families.

Layaway had become a popular option for many families during the holiday season helping people afford gifts decorations and other holiday essentials during a pricey time of year. Now some customers are accusing Walmart of ruining the holidays by getting rid of the traditional service. ""Congrats on killing Christmas for SO MANY families who were DEPENDING on layaway for Christmas & who do not qualify for Affirm"" one user tweeted directly at Walmart's official Twitter account.

Another spoke directly about their long-standing experience with the layaway option a payment option that dates back to the 1920s. ""My parents had to use layaway a few times over the years when I was young. A couple of times we may not have had Christmas presents under the tree without that free service"" the customer said.

This is not the first time Walmart has gotten rid of layaway.

At one point Walmart offered layaway services year-round. But in 2006 the retailer decided to phase out the program altogether citing ""declining use and increasing costs."" Walmart then chose to bring layaway back in 2011 for the holiday season according to The New York Times and customers have been relying on the service for holiday purchases since then.

""Our customer was saying if they had two more paycheck cycles that really would be helpful for them"" Duncan Mac Naughton the former chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S told the news outlet at the time. ""It just tells us the customer's still struggling as they tell us about their concerns with energy prices housing prices the job security that 9.2 percent unemployment—it tells us that this is a fragile economy and the customer needs our help."" By comparison the unemployment rate now is 5.2 percent according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics but of course it's been a trying financial time for many.ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb

""When our 6 kids were little we didn't have a lot of money and it was hard to save I'd do a Walmart layaway every year for Christmas as it was easier to make payments than to save. Now Walmart is using a lender that will charge up to 30!!% interest. Shame on them"" another customer wrote on Twitter.

Best Life has reached out to Walmart for a response to the customer backlash but did not immediately hear back.

It changed acres and acres of orange groves. It changed Orlando. It changed Florida. It changed an already legendary company. And it changed the entire theme park industry.

Walt Disney World Resort opened on October 1 1971. And on its 50th anniversary it continues to be a major driver in the travel world weathering big shifts in tourism trends notorious Florida hurricanes and a pandemic.

Back in ’71 there was just the one theme park Magic Kingdom along with a couple of adjacent golf courses and resorts.

Since then three more major parks have been added: Epcot in 1982 Hollywood Studios in 1989 and Animal Kingdom in 1998. In addition the water parks Typhoon Lagoon (1989 and temporarily closed) and Blizzard Beach (1995) were added to the resort.

And Disney now has 12 parks in six different resorts on three different continents.

The Florida park was actually the second baby in the Disney bunch. It came 16 years after Southern California’s Disneyland which opened on July 17 1955.

But sibling No. 2 didn’t stay in the shadows.

“Obviously WDW has become one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world in its short 50-year history” said Martin Lewison an associate professor of business management at Farmingdale State College on Long Island New York in an email interview.

Known in theme park circles as “Professor Roller Coaster” he said Walt Disney World is a dominating force in the global attractions industry.

“Just as the 1955 opening of Disneyland in California convinced other entrepreneurs that theme parks were a good investment … the opening of Walt Disney World in 1971 led to another spurt of theme park building in the USA” he said.

Lewison noted some of the major amusement parks that followed soon after: Kings Island in Ohio in 1972 Carowinds on the North Carolina-South Carolina border in 1973 Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey in 1974 and Kings Dominion and Busch Gardens in Virginia in 1975.

“WDW has led the industry in many areas: ride design and technology entertainment resort development transportation systems special events dining experiences ticket pricing queue products merchandising [and] conservation” Lewison said.

Professor Roller Coaster plans to visit the park for the first time since 2019 in November for the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attraction Expo.

His favorite rides include the classics such as Pirates of the Caribbean and the Haunted Mansion and some of the newer rides such as Avatar Flight of Passage.

He said he’s looking forward to his first ride on Mickey & Minnie’s Runaway Railway among others.

Changes and traditions at the park

A whole lot has changed at the Florida park since 1971. Notable additions came years and decades later: Space Mountain (opened in 1975) Splash Mountain (1992) and the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train (2014).

Despite all the changes and advancements 50 years have brought some of the original rides and attractions from 1971 remain today.

They include beloved favorites such as the Country Bear Jamboree Dumbo the Flying Elephant the Haunted Mansion and the Tomorrowland Speedway. Jungle Cruise has recently been updated at Disneyland and Disney World to address racially insensitive stereotypes.

And of course the signature structure of the park Cinderella Castle has been there from the start though she’s seen some makeovers over the years.

How Disney will celebrate the anniversary

Disney’s 50th anniversary party starts on Friday but it’s hardly going to be a one-day affair.

This is going to be an 18-month party. And celebrations will be held not only in the Magic Kingdom but at the other three of the resort’s theme parks.

A “Beacons of Magic” show starts Friday where signature structures in each park will be specially illuminated: Cinderella Castle in Magic Kingdom Spaceship Earth at Epcot Hollywood Tower Hotel at Hollywood Studios and the Tree of Life at Animal Kingdom.

Just at the Magic Kingdom a nighttime show called “Disney Enchantment” will feature music enhanced lighting fireworks and immersive projection effects from Cinderella Castle down Main Street U.S.A.

Through innovation and creativity Disney has opened four theme parks two water parks dozens of resort hotels and a massive retail dining and entertainment district.

The legacy of the last 50 years is currently being honored as Walt Disney World Resort kicked off its 50th anniversary celebration dubbed ‘The World’s Most Magical Celebration’ on the same day that Disney opened its first park in Florida in 1971. Festivities will go for 18 months as new experiences debut across the entire resort.

MORE NEWS: The history of Walt Disney World and its opening 50 years ago

As we celebrate we are looking back at the rich and exciting history of the Florida theme park resort. From construction in the heart of Central Florida to grand opening ceremonies immersive new attractions and more Walt Disney World Resort has had no shortage of incredible moments.

THE 1960s

Walt Disney and his brother Roy O. Disney were said to have announced their plans for Disney World during a press conference held in Downtown Orlando on November 15th 1965.

""After taking a look at the land this morning I say we are starting from scratch. We have many things in mind that could make this unique and different than Disneyland"" Walt said. ""To have this enthusiasm on the part of our whole organization and on the part of the people of the state of Florida really is a good start.""

A year later he filmed a video outlining his plans for the Florida project including details on why Central Florida was a perfect fit.

""We have a perfect location in Florida – almost in the very center of the state"" Walt explained. ""Here in Florida we have something special we never enjoyed at Disneyland – the blessing of size. There is enough land here to hold all the ideas and plans we can possibly imagine.""

Unfortunately visionary Walt Disney passed away just a few months after filming on December 15th 1966. His brother Roy would go on to lead the company’s Florida project.

It was not until May 30th 1967 that Magic Kingdom’s groundbreaking kicked off. On this day Roy O. Disney reportedly named the project ‘Walt Disney World’ to ensure that the world would always remember his brother’s dream.

THE 1970s

After years of waiting the day was finally here: Walt Disney World Resort opened to the public on October 1st 1971. Disney explained that the first phase included the Magic Kingdom park Disney’s Contemporary Resort and Disney’s Polynesian Village Resort.

While the park officially opened on October 1st it was not until October 25th 1971 that Disney held its grand opening and dedication ceremony. Roy O. Disney was in attendance and read a dedication plaque aloud with Mickey Mouse at his side.

""Walt Disney World is a tribute to the philosophy and the life of Walter Isias Disney and to the talents and the dedication and the loyalty of the entire Disney organization that’s made Walt Disney’s dream come true"" he said. ""May Walt Disney World bring joy and inspiration and new knowledge to all who come to this happy place. A Magic Kingdom where the young at heart of all ages can laugh and play and learn together.""

A dedication parade followed featuring 5000 performers lead by Mickey Mouse playing the world’s largest bass drum at the time Disney said. There was also a performance from a 1076-piece ceremonial marching band.

In the few years that followed Magic Kingdom’s debut Disney was hard at work opening more attractions at the park.

For example on December 15th 1973 ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ opened. Two years later on January 15th ‘Space Mountain’ and the ‘GE Carousel of Progress’ opened. Months after this the ‘WEDway PeopleMover’ attraction now known as the ‘Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover’ opened.

Also in 1975 the ‘Lake Buena Vista Shopping Village’ is said to have opened with 28 shops and four restaurants. This was just the start of what is now known as ‘Disney Springs’ a retail dining and entertainment district.

With expansions going nicely at Magic Kingdom Walt Disney World moved on to its next major project: Epcot.

Walt Disney had previously described Epcot as ""the most exciting and by far the most important part of our Florida project — in fact the heart of everything we will be doing in Disney World — will be our ‘Experimental Prototype City of Tomorrow.’ We call it ‘Epcot.’""

He explained that ""Epcot will take its queue from the new ideas and new technologies that are now emerging from the creative centers of American industry. It will be a community of tomorrow that will never be completed. That will always be introducing and testing and demonstrating new materials and new systems.""

Construction for the park began just before the decade came to a close starting on October 1st 1979 Disney said.

Closing out the decade strong Walt Disney World opened its third Florida park ‘Hollywood Studios’ formerly known as ‘Disney-MGM Studios’ on May 1st 1989.

During all these park openings Disney said that it also opened ‘Pleasure Island’ a nighttime entertainment complex that included an array of restaurants and nightclubs. It eventually closed in 2008 to make way for Disney Springs.

THE 1990’S

The existing three Florida parks that Disney had in the 1990s continued to strive bringing magic to the thousands of families that walked through its gates daily.

Hollywood Studios reportedly underwent several expansions in this decade. For example the park opened its ‘Sunset Boulevard’ themed area on June 12th 1994 bringing more shops dining and entertainment to the park. ‘The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror’ opened a little over a month later.

Then on March 28th 1997 the 220-acre ’ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex’ is said to have opened with outdoor playing fields baseball/softball diamonds a track and field complex a fieldhouse and a 9500-seat ballpark. Over time two more fieldhouses an ESPN broadcast center and more outdoor playing fields were added.

The 1990s also saw the debut of the final Walt Disney World theme park: Animal Kingdom. It opened on April 22nd 1998 which was Earth Day. It is the resort’s largest park and home to about 1800 animals representing 200 species. At the center of it all is the ’Tree of Life’ which features more than 300 carved animal images.

THE 2020s

Continuing off of the success of the last decade Walt Disney World has several exciting plans for the 2020s — some of which have already happened. However this decade has also already seen adversity like never before as the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the world.

Just weeks prior to closing the parks down to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 ‘Mickey & Minnie’s Runaway Railway’ opened at Hollywood Studios on March 4th 2020. This is said to be the first ride-through attraction at a Disney park dedicated to the ‘Mickey Mouse’ and ‘Minnie Mouse’ characters.

On March 15th 2020 all four Walt Disney World parks closed down due to the COVID-19 pandemic beginning what is said to be the park’s largest closure in its history according to the Orlando Sentinel. This was also only the seventh time that the Walt Disney World parks closed.

By July 2020 the parks reopened in two phases: Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom on July 11th and then Hollywood Studios and Epcot on July 15th. With its reopening came new protocols to keep park guests safe including mandatory temperature checks reservations required for entry reduced capacity and a face mask requirement.

AP

ORLANDO Fla. — Applying to be one of the first workers at Walt Disney World high school graduate George Kalogridis made a split-second decision that set the course for his life: he picked a room where prospective hotel workers were being hired.

Chuck Milam got a tip about a job opening from a transplanted Disney executive whose new house he was landscaping. Earliene Anderson jumped at the chance to take a job at the new Disney theme park in Florida having fallen in love with the beauty of Disneyland in California during a trip two years earlier.

At the time the three were among the 6000 employees who opened the Magic Kingdom at Disney World to the public for the first time on Oct. 1 1971. Now they are among two dozen from that first day still employed at the theme park resort as it celebrates its 50th anniversary.

►10 ways to soak in the magic:From fairy tale beginnings to Disney World's 50th anniversary

Over the decades Disney World added three more theme parks two dozen additional hotels and grew to have a workforce of 77000 employees as it helped Orlando become the most visited place in the U.S. before the pandemic.

What never changed was the original employees' devotion to the pixie dust the dream machine created by Walt Disney and his Imagineers.

“Disney has been my love and it still is"" Anderson said recently before starting her shift in merchandising at a Magic Kingdom hotel. “I love Disney.""

The employees who make up the 50-year club say the theme park resort has allowed them to grow their careers and try on new hats. Kalogridis worked his way up to be president of Walt Disney World and Disneyland in California. Milam went from a warehouse worker to a buyer of spare parts for rides and shows.

Forrest Bahruth joined the workforce at Disney World in January 1971 as a show director responsible for staging and choreographing parades and shows. He was also given the opportunity to help open other Disney theme parks around the world over the past five decades.

“There are people all over the world who get up to go work. They’re unhappy about it. They don’t really like their jobs” Bahruth said. “As you can tell from us there’s an enthusiasm. We are privileged to be at a place where we love what we do.""

There was no guarantee that Disney World was going to be a success 50 years ago. Walt Disney the pioneering animator and entrepreneur whose name graces the Florida resort had died in 1966 just a year after announcing plans for “the East Coast Disneyland."" The company had quietly acquired 27000 acres of scrub land outside Orlando for around $5 million via secret land purchases using fake names and shell companies.

The job of shepherding the project to Opening Day fell to his brother Roy Disney who with other company officials convinced the Florida Legislature to create a quasi-governmental agency that would allow Disney to self-govern when it came to matters of infrastructure and planning. Roy died almost three months after Disney World opened.

Just weeks before opening construction at the Magic Kingdom was controlled chaos and it seemed impossible that it would all come together in time.

“It was like an army of ants. Everything was under construction. Interiors were still being put in. Roofing was still being put on top"" Bahruth said. “There was painting landscaping. Things were arriving by the moment. It was like trucks going everywhere.""

Bahruth rehearsed performers through parade choreography down Main Street which cut through the center of the Magic Kingdom and resembled a turn-of-the-century small town from Walt Disney's childhood. Even though he was a busser Kalogridis was drafted into laying down sod outside the hotel he was working in hours before Disney World's grand opening.

Two things have stuck in the memories of the longtime employees from that opening day. The first was the photo. It was an image of thousands of Disney World workers standing in front of the iconic Cinderella Castle with Mickey Mouse and other costumed characters holding hands in front. Two weeks later it was featured on the cover of Life magazine.

“They brought all the characters up staged them first and then they tried to keep all the different workers together based on the color of their costumes” Milam said. “If you were from Fantasyland and in yellow you would go over there.”

►50 toys for 50 years:McDonald's marks Disney World's anniversary with Happy Meals

The second was the parade. It featured a 1076-member marching band conducted by Meredith Willson the composer of the Broadway show “The Music Man."" There were 4000 Disney entertainers marching through the theme park a mass choir and trumpeters from the United States Army Band. Hundreds of white doves were released into the air and less environmentally friendly so were thousands of multi-colored balloons.

“It was the biggest thing I had ever seen"" Bahruth said.

Only around 10000 visitors showed up on that first day — which at today's much larger Walt Disney World would represent about 90 minutes' worth of visitors entering. It wouldn't be until Thanksgiving 1971 almost three months later when Disney executives had an answer about whether their new resort would be a success; that's when cars trying to get into the Magic Kingdom stretched for miles down the interstate.

“It was very clear after that first Thanksgiving that the public definitely liked what we were doing"" Kalogridis said. “That first Thanksgiving that was the moment.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwdHYuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS90YXN0ZS1hbmQtc2VlL3dlbGxpbmd0b24tZmFtaWx5LW1ha2VzLXRoZWlyLXdheS10by10aGUtNTB0aC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1vZi13YWx0LWRpc25leS13b3JsZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wellington family makes their way to 50th anniversary of Disney World,"LAKE BUENA VISTA Fla. — Friday marked the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney World opening near Orlando and families like the Murphys of Wellington were eager to celebrate.

The Murphys moved to Wellington a few years ago from New Jersey. Now that they live closer to the mouse they like to visit about once a month. To say they are Disney enthusiasts is an understatement.

""This is Jimmy my oldest son (on) his first trip to Disney. And that was in 2011"" said Sarah Murphy as she showed WPTV NewsChannel 5 one of her many Disney picture frames.

Jimmy Murphy 11 has Disney books bed spreads furniture paintings stuffed animals and Legos tastefully placed all over his bedroom and house.

Jimmy especially loves the creator Walt Disney.

""He built a lot and he created a lot. He drew. He acted. He produced. He did it all"" Jimmy said. ""He came out poor but he rose and he worked so hard to do what he did. He created Mickey Mouse. He made countless movies. Really countless.""

Jimmy's Walt Disney collection is vast and he's been collecting Disney paraphernalia his entire life so this is really old Mickey. I don't exactly know when it's from I but I can assume it's from the 70s.""

I asked if that was old (I was born in the '70s ""yes"" Jimmy said confidently.

""OK"" I said deflated.

The Murphys made their way to the Magic Kingdom on the official 50th anniversary.

""Oct. 1 marks the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney World"" Jimmy said. ""I've been going to Walt Disney World for all my life. So it's really cool that I get to go and I really like it.""

His father loves the lifetime of memories Walt Disney World creates for his family.

""To be able to think that our kids one day will be able to possibly attend the 100th anniversary you know and look back at the photos and maybe you this interview and say 'Hey you know we were there with your grandfather and this and that.' And so it's special and that's why we're here today"" Jim Murphy said.

Jimmy's mom likes the escapism Walt Disney World creates.

""I guess I appreciate walking through any of the parks and just looking around and everyone just seems to be happy and there doesn't seem to be any issues in the world"" Sarah Murphy said. ""You kind of forget about life itself and I think that Walt created that and it's been carried out through the 50 years.""

She thinks the theme parks are the therapy kids need right now.

""And I think that with kids and all they're going through with being in school and out of school and mask and whatnot it gives the kids just that fun time to see characters and go on some rides and just have fun"" Sarah said."

The municipal solid waste landfill and recycling center at 13469 SW Highway 18 is owned and operated by Waste Management Inc. and has been in operation since 1982.

It has an air pollution permit from the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality.

Under the federal Clean Air Act Riverbend Landfill is required to capture the emissions generated as the garbage breaks down.

Paint oil plastic:What is Covanta burning in Brooks Oregon?

To ensure it is capturing the emissions adequately Riverbend Landfill is also required to conduct surveys of the surface of the landfill to see if any gases are leaking at least four times per year.

This survey involves traversing the landfill using an instrument that measures methane present in the air. If methane emissions above 500 parts per million are measured the landfill must take corrective action to ensure those emissions are captured.

In 2018 an EPA inspection found nine separate instances of methane emissions greater than 500 ppm at different areas of the landfill.

A review of facility records showed that the company's emissions surveys did not find any areas above 500 ppm between 2015 and 2018 including surface emission monitoring studies before and after EPA’s inspection.

Comparing the results from EPA’s inspection and Riverbend Landfill’s surveys EPA determined that Riverbend Landfill did not conduct adequate surface emission monitoring.

EPA also determined that the company failed to monitor the landfill’s cover integrity monthly as required. It also failed to perform the required monthly monitoring of an onsite well.

The settlement requires the company to conduct enhanced monitoring inspection and tracking measures to identify and address emissions.

Waste Management headquartered in Houston is one of the nation's largest waste management and environmental services companies.

Landfills are the third-largest source of methane pollution which is one of the main contributors to climate change according to the EPA.

In addition to methane emissions landfill gases contain hazardous air pollutants that can cause adverse health effects. Those pollutants can include vinyl chloride ethyl benzene toluene and benzene. All of the airborne toxic chemicals emitted from MSW landfills can cause adverse health effects provided sufficient exposure.

Daily Graphic Oct - 02 - 2021  04:12

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has begun a programme to collect electrical and electronic waste for proper disposal.

The initiative which is a partnership between the EPA and Excellent Waste Management includes visit to public and private establishments to inspect and collect e-waste for recycling.

At the launch of the pilot programme in Accra yesterday the Executive Director of the EPA Dr Henry Kwabena Kokofu unveiled a specialised truck to be used for the exercise in the Greater Accra Region.

He said additional vehicles would be purchased for the programme which would be extended to the other regions.

EPA Act

Dr Kokofu said the initiative was in line with provisions of Section 1(3) of the EPA Act 1994 (Act 490).

Section 1(3) of Act 490 stipulates that ""the EPA may in the performance of its functions acquire and hold movable or immovable property and enter into a contract or any other transaction"".

He said it was also in furtherance of Section 31 of the Hazardous and Electronic Waste Control Management Act 2016 (Act 917) which says ""the minister on the advice of the EPA may make arrangements for the establishment of electrical and electronic waste recycling plants and related facilities in the country"".

""Effectively the project has started. We have a team of environmental inspectors who will be going round institutions to inspect used electrical and electronic equipment and other hazardous waste.

“We will also look at how the institutions are storing them and how they dispose of the equipment. If they have no plans we will give them the plan and take charge do inventory invoice and transport them to designated and appropriately licensed recycling facilities"" Dr Kokofu added.

He stressed the need for ministries departments and agencies (MDAs) as well as metropolitan municipal and district assemblies (MMDAs) to put in place mechanisms to segregate waste to make its disposal and recycling efficient.

Novelty

The General Manager of Excellent Waste Management Mr Samuel Asiamah described the partnership with the EPA as a novelty and giant step towards the effective management of e-waste.

He said the company would deliver its mandate efficiently to address e-waste challenges in the country.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2NhbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vaW5kaWEva2FybmF0YWthL3N3YWNoaGEtc2Fua2Vlcm5hLXdhc3RlLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtdW5pdC1pbmF1Z3VyYXRlZC0xMDM2Njc1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Swachha Sankeerna waste management unit inaugurated,The villagers should segregate the waste at the source before handing it over to waste collectors.

The move is to guarantee that electronic gadgets such as laptops mobile phones air conditioners fridges and microwaves are disposed of by the right people at the licenced facility.

Where the Agency’s officials have reasons to believe that the waste gadgets posed danger and nuisance to the environment EPA will move in to take inventory and ensure that the institution pays for the gadgets to be disposed of safely.

Dr Henry Kokofu the Executive Director of the Agency announced this at an event to outdoor a pilot project to collect hazardous and e-waste for safe management and disposal by experts.

The project is a joint venture between the Environmental Protection Agency and Excellent Waste Management which seeks to help clean-up e-waste create jobs and boost revenue.

The EPA Executive Director said the pilot project was part of a grand plan to continue to spearhead the fight against environmental pollution as mandated by law to among other things guide development to prevent reduce and as far as possible eliminate pollution and actions that lowered the quality of life.

Dr Kokofu said the EPA as part of the pilot project would take up other initiatives in the area of plastic waste collection and scrap metals to practicalised the circular economy idea.

On the new project he said already institutions including the Electoral Commission and the Electricity company of Ghana sought the services of the Agency to safely manage and dispose of old electronic gadgets.

Dr Kokofu said the pilot project would be implemented nationwide to sustain the effort at Agbogbloshie which earned the country an unenviable name as the country with biggest e-waste yard globally.

He mentioned that the idea was to acquire more trucks and dispatch to Tema Sunyani Takoradi Tamale Koforidua to ensure that e-waste was properly disposed.

The Director said institutions that would like to engage the services of the Agency should reach out to them via letter or call.

Mr Samuel Asiamah the General Manager of Excellent Waste Management said the proper management of e-waste would help clean up the environment for the next generation.

He stated that the Company would work diligently to ensure the success of the project.

According to the GIZ 95 per cent of electrical and electronic waste was collected but both collection and recycling were organised largely informally.

(AP) — Crude was no longer leaking from a Southern California pipeline that’s believed to be the source of a massive oil spill that closed miles of beaches on Sunday according to the head of the company that owns the facility.

Amplify Energy CEO Martyn Willsher said Sunday that divers are still trying to determine exactly where and how the spill happened but the pipeline has been shut off. He says all remaining oil in the line has been suctioned out.

Officials said late Saturday that at least 126000 gallons (572807 liters) of crude spilled into the waters off Orange County from a pipeline that runs to shore from an oil platform maintained by Beta Operating Company a subsidiary of Houston-based Amplify.

Crews have deployed skimmers and booms to try to corral the slick.

Huntington Beach Mayor Kim Carr said the city’s beaches could remain closed for weeks or even months.

He may have been encouraged to head our way by his brother Nathaniel a silk merchant with a business nearby.

He began making mineral waters in a cellar at the back of his shop and how the people loved his drinks. He had to move to bigger premises in Bedford Street and take on more workers to meet demand.

And these weren’t run-of-the-mill thirst-quenchers. They offered a rare and exotic taste.

Ginger beer was top of the pops along with lemonade and a range of tonic beverages…which people queued up for.

There was soda potash seltzer and more.

It was time to move again…and in 1880 he set up his expanded business at George Allen’s former weaver’s workshop at Chapel Field near to his home in The Crescent.

The trouble was that the booming soft drinks business did well in the summer months but when temperatures dropped so did the sales.

What to do? Albert did not want to lay his workers off.

So he started making a much-loved winter warmer – cocoa - and in 1886 that led to a product people could enjoy at any time of the year – chocolate.

He had hit the jackpot and started producing milk chocolate – a market dominated by the Swiss - with supplies from the cows at Whitlingham.

This was the famous herd of Red Poll cattle at the well-known farm run by Garrett Taylor. It resulted in mouth-watering milk confectionary.

Within a few years they had run of room and this time in 1890 built a big new factory nearby which would become one of the great Norwich workplaces…one which sent a sweet smell across the city.

Albert died in 1895 having laid the foundations of a great business. His son Edward and nephew Frederick took over at the helm at the company which became known as A J Caley and Son.

By now their mineral waters were loved by members of the Royal Family and was served at the top hotels around the country and at the House of Commons. The water was drawn from deep two Artesian wells.

Come 1904 the company was employing 700 people producing a range of drinks chocolate and Christmas crackers.

They had agencies across the world – from Australia to Canada – and their chocolate and crackers were shipped to some of the most remote places on earth.

During the First World War tens of thousands of Caley’s famous Marching Chocolate bars were delivered to troops on the front line. A rare treat during those dark and bloody days.

The company remained in the hands of the Caley family until the end of the war when the business was sold to the African and Eastern Trade Corporation.

It was later over by John Mackintosh and Sons of Halifax in 1932. Nestle eventually took over and it closed 25 years ago amid much anger but that’s a story for another day.

As for their ginger beer…Caley’s proclaimed:

“Brewed ginger beer for which Caley’s are justly celebrated was first brought to perfection under their aegis.

“Caley’s brewery which is in many respects a replica of an ordinary brewery is built in tower form in order to utilise the advantages of gravity as a means of clarifying.

“Huge vats and tanks are on every floor and the place is kept spotlessly clean. In the basement is the storage cellar which will hold 150000 filled bottles at one time.”

Did you know?

Caley’s bought The Elms in Unthank Road which became the HQ of the Recreational Association with space for 250 people plus six grass tennis courts and a large bowling green. The bowls club was in the City League of the Norwich Bowling Association and their darks and billiards teams were tough to beat. The children of the workers loved the special Christmas parties.

No wonder some of their early advertisements caught the eye – they were designed by a young Alfred Munnings who was an apprentice at Page Brothers in Norwich. He also designed posters and chocolate boxes.",,,,,,,,,

Google is shuttering its bank account product nearly two years after announcing ambitious plans to take on the retail finance industry. One key factor: The new head of the business Bill Ready decided that he'd rather develop a digital banking and payments ecosystem instead of competing with banks according to a person with knowledge of the decision.

For the past few years bank executives and investors have shuddered whenever a tech giant disclosed plans to break into finance. With good reason: Tech giants have access to hundreds of millions of users and their data and a track record for transforming industries like media and advertising.

But the reality has proven less disruptive so far. While Amazon was reportedly exploring bank accounts in 2018 the project has yet to materialize. Uber reined in its fintech ambitions last year. Facebook was forced to rebrand its crypto project amid a series of setbacks.

""We're updating our approach to focus primarily on delivering digital enablement for banks and other financial services providers rather than us serving as the provider of these services"" a Google spokeswoman said in a statement.

Google which is owned by parent company Alphabet could help banks provide more secure ways for consumers to make online purchases like via virtual cards or single-use tokens. That's according to the person with knowledge of the company who declined to be identified speaking about business strategy. Those methods cut down on fraud by protecting users' credit-card numbers.

Google may have ultimately decided it wasn't worth antagonizing current and prospective customers for its various businesses including cloud computing according to a Friday research note from Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo.

In recent years Google has funneled more resources to its cloud business which still lags behind Amazon and Microsoft in market share. However it has made steady gains under cloud boss Thomas Kurian who along with Google CEO Sundar Pichai has repeatedly touted financial services as a target in terms of customers they hope to attract.

""Banks are worried about disintermediation and I think it's likely that Google executives were getting signals that banks weren't on board with what Google was going to do"" said Peter Wannemacher a Forrester Research analyst who advises banks on digital efforts. ""They made the bet that there was a greater gain in selling to banks rather than selling to customers.""

Being the customer-facing entity for banks may have risked inviting greater regulatory and Congressional scrutiny he said. As it is the public has already become suspicious of technology firms' reach he added.

""Financial services is a difficult space to get into"" Wannemacher said. ""Everyone knows that but it's often more vexing and knotty than people expect.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL2ZhZGVhd2F5d29ybGQubmV0L2xlYnJvbi1qYW1lcy1hZHZpY2UtdG8tYmVuLXNpbW1vbnMtaW4tY29sbGVnZS15b3UtaGF2ZS1hbi1vcHBvcnR1bml0eS10by1iZS1iZXR0ZXItdGhhbi1tZS1idXQteW91LWNhbnQtc2tpcC1zdGVwc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"LeBron James' Advice To Ben Simmons In College: ""You Have An Opportunity To Be Better Than Me.

If that’s the case the All-Star point guard could be sitting for a long time.

Following a brutal performance in the playoffs a separation between Simmons and the 76ers seemed inevitable. But Philadelphia set an extremely high asking price and that drove interested teams away from a potential trade.

As the 76ers’ dramatic summer dragged on Simmons made his intentions clear. He wouldn’t report to training camp and he is committed to never playing for Philadelphia again. He also leaked subtle shots at Joel Embiid and ignored efforts from teammates who reached out to him.

With the 76ers not budging off their asking price and Simmons refusing to suit up for the franchise NBA teams are taking notice and this saga could play out into the regular season.

Meanwhile real Simmons trade talk between the 76ers and other teams continues to be nearly dead sources tell NBC Sports. Teams have settled into their rosters for the start of the season. Until a franchise suffers a significant injury or gets off to a slower-than-expected start (or maybe faster) there is nothing to change that dynamic and spark a deal. NBC Sports Philadelphia’s Kurt Helin on latest Ben Simmons trade talks

Philadelphia is already holding training camp and it’s evident this relationship won’t be repaired in the near future. The 76ers withheld an $8.25 million payment and the star guard seems willing to lose out on millions of dollars to force a trade.

Ben Simmons contract: $33 million (2021-’22) $35.45 million (2022-’23) $37.9 million (2023-’23) and $40.34 million (2024-’25)

Neither side is in a good situation. Simmons is under contract through 2024 meaning Philadelphia can withhold his salary as long as he holds out. But the 76ers want to compete for an NBA championship this season and they have no shot at doing that without Simmons or quality talent acquired via trade.

Ultimately one of the two sides will cave. That will likely be the 76ers who might ultimately realize it’s better to get something than to just have an All-Star sitting out all year."

I. du Pont de Nemours and Company the company that popularized Teflon-brand fluoropolymer coating for nonstick pans started looking for new markets that might benefit from the strong fluorine-carbon bonds in fluorochemicals. The company began to sell stain-resistance treatments for carpets and fabrics. It also found success with fluorochemicals that help food packaging paper and paperboard resist grease and water.

In brief Fluorochemicals have long been used as a treatment to make paper wraps for burgers and other foods resist grease and water. Now several US states are banning the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in fiber-based food packaging. At the same time health and environmental advocates are pushing restaurant and grocery chains to stop using wraps paperboard and fiber containers with added PFAS. Papermakers are rolling out new products to meet this demand—but what’s taking the place of PFAS is hidden behind a wall of corporate confidentiality. Third parties are stepping in with tools to examine the safety of PFAS alternatives while protecting trade secrets.

For decades scores of these per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) gained approval from regulators in the US and elsewhere. PFAS are extremely good at rendering paper wraps and containers impervious to grease and moisture oozing from hamburgers french fries and other foods.

Today fast-food chains and grocery stores are realizing that fluorochemicals are not always the wonder materials they were made out to be. PFAS are environmentally persistent and some are toxic. And studies finding that PFAS in paper wraps and boxes can migrate into food have piled up in recent years (Foods 2021 DOI: 10.3390/foods10071443).Because of those concerns many food companies are switching from single-use containers and wraps made with PFAS to packaging without these “forever chemicals” as ingredients.

But the identities of the chemicals or coatings that companies are switching to are typically proprietary information. Citing competition most paper and packaging companies won’t discuss the products they’re making. Supermarkets and restaurants can find third-party assurances that the paper food ware they buy has no added PFAS. Yet they don’t generally know what substances are being used instead.

“Not only are these specific chemicals that we want removed from our packaging materials; we also want to make sure that we don’t introduce other hazardous chemicals” as alternatives says Boma Brown-West director of consumer health at the Environmental Defense Fund an advocacy group. While in an ideal world consumers would know what the replacement chemicals are some organizations say such knowledge might not be as important as toxicity data reviewed confidentially by third parties showing that they are safer than the PFAS they replace.

We’re trying to avoid regrettable substitution. Boma Brown-West director of consumer health Environmental Defense Fund

A long history

The US Food and Drug Administration approved the first PFAS for coating paper and paperboard E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company’s Zonyl RP in 1967. The company called the product which repelled water and oil a “paper fluoridizer.”

For the first time ever PFAS were on food packaging. Over time more companies entered this market with dozens of similar chemicals. In more recent years as the biopersistence of PFAS became clear chemical makers shifted from long-chain PFAS—such as Zonyl RP—to short-chain ones which generally contain six or fewer carbons for treating food packaging materials. Many researchers believe short-chain PFAS have less potential to bioaccumulate though their toxicity is similar to that of their longer-chain cousins.

Then in 2020 the FDA announced that four chemical manufacturers were voluntarily phasing out the sale of 6:2 fluorotelomer alcohol one of the short-chain PFAS for use in paper and cardboard food packaging. This substance degrades in the environment to form persistent and biologically active perfluoroalkyl acids.

Today the FDA’s Inventory of Food Contact Substances which lists materials the agency deems “demonstrated to be safe for their intended use” contains about 50 fluorochemicals that are approved to be marketed in the US. All the fluorochemicals in the inventory received FDA approval between 2000 and 2020.

It’s unclear how many of them are still being sold for food packaging.

Pressure to shift from PFAS

Three main forces are moving food packaging makers away from PFAS says Shari Franjevic of Clean Production Action a Massachusetts-based organization that promotes green chemicals materials and products.

One push comes from state legislation enacted in Connecticut Maine Minnesota New York Vermont and Washington that bans PFAS in food packaging she says. Enhancing this movement is the European Union’s effort to restrict uses of all PFAS Franjevic says.

A major US industry group is challenging efforts to phase out PFAS in products including in food packaging.

PFAS-free options

“All PFAS are not the same” stresses the American Chemistry Council which represents chemical manufacturers including makers of fluorochemicals. “It is neither scientifically accurate nor appropriate to group them all together by the entire class—especially when discussing the health profiles” of these chemicals the trade organization tells C&EN in a statement.

Members of the ACC voluntarily agreed to phase out certain PFAS for use in paper-based food packaging the group points out. But “for many PFAS uses there aren’t alternatives” it says.

Bypassing the policy debate several US environmental and health groups are urging fast-food chains and other big purchasers to voluntarily switch to PFAS-free paper wraps and containers. These efforts are a second major force in the switch away from PFAS in food packaging Franjevic says.

“Retailers are playing an incredibly important role in moving the marketplace away from these toxic ‘forever’ chemicals” says Mike Schade campaign director of Mind the Store in a recent statement. Mind the Store is a program run by the research and advocacy group Toxic-Free Future.“With many thousands of pounds of PFAS in circulation due to their use in food packaging we applaud those companies that commit to phasing out these toxics in food packaging.”

As of September 2021 eight fast-food and fast-casual restaurant chains—Cava Chipotle Freshii McDonald’s Panera Bread Sweetgreen Taco Bell and Wendy’s—had committed to eliminate PFAS from food packaging by dates ranging from 2020 to 2025 according to Mind the Store. The group is asking for large retailers to eliminate toxic chemicals in products and packaging.

The campaign continues to target Burger King. The CEO of that chain’s parent corporation Restaurant Brands International announced at a shareholders’ meeting in June that the business is exploring alternatives to PFAS.

Compostability questions

A third factor driving the switch away from PFAS is the desire by purchasers of single-use food ware to move from plastic containers to compostable paper items. To the surprise of many of these buyers some items sold as compostable were treated with PFAS environmental advocates say. Researchers have found that these containers could release PFAS into the environment if composted (Environ. Sci. Technol. Lett. 2019 DOI: 10.1021/acs.estlett.9b00280).

Compostable products are certified in North America by the Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI). This association sets standards for the breakdown of products that can be mixed with food scraps and yard trimmings in commercial facilities to produce compost. As of Jan. 1 2020 the BPI has excluded products with added organic fluorinated chemicals from qualifying for its certification.

Because PFAS are persistent in the environment traces of these compounds may be present in the wood or water used for making paper and in the final products industry and environmental sources point out. Thus manufacturers and activists are stressing the lack of added PFAS in products.

Industry is rapidly developing and deploying alternatives to PFAS for all types of single-use fiber-based food ware. One strategy is to use mechanical means to make fibers denser—be they from wood bamboo palm leaves or sugarcane waste—so they resist getting soaked through. “They squish the fibers really close together” Franjevic says.

But mechanical means are often not enough to render fibers impermeable. Another approach is to employ a PFAS-free chemical barrier—either a surface treatment or a product added to pulp.

Some of the treatments that food-ware manufacturers rely on are disclosed in general terms and not down to the molecule. Examples include silicones clays waxes and biobased plastics such as polylactic acid according to information gathered by Clean Production Action. A 2017 report the Nordic countries compiled also lists treatment ingredients: starch carboxymethyl cellulose polyvinyl alcohol wax hydroxyethylcellulose styrene-butadiene copolymer the linear polysaccharide chitosan alkyl ketene dimer and alkenyl succinic anhydride.

Mum’s the word

Buyers of PFAS-free food ware are demanding evidence such as BPI certification that the paper goods they buy do not contain added PFAS. But purchasers still often don’t know what chemicals or technologies make these products resist grease and water.

Take the grocery store chain Whole Foods Market which is focused on organic foods and environmental stewardship. Whole Foods learned in 2018 that the containers it bought for in-store use such as at the salad bar were treated with PFAS says Jody Villecco the company’s principal quality standards adviser. That December Toxic-Free Future’s Safer Chemicals Healthy Families program released a report showing that packaging for take-out foods sold by several grocery chains including Whole Foods likely contained PFAS.

“Through supplier surveys and product rtesting we have discontinued or reformulated any food service packaging where it was disclosed or determined that PFAS may have been intentionally added” Villeccor says in an email. “Whole Foods Market works with our packaging suppliers and a variety of non-profits academics and government stakeholders to avoid intentionalrly added PFAS.”

She adds “In some instances we were ablre to transition from product that was PFAS-treated to product that was non-PFAS treated and already commercially available. But in other instances we had to work with our suppliers to reformulate food service packaging.”

While the grocery chain knows that the food ware it is buying now has no added PFAS it doesn’t know what’s being used instead. “Disclosure of packaging components is not standard practice in the industry” Villecco says.

C&EN contacted a number of companies that manufacture paper products for food packaging asking them to discuss alternatives to PFAS and the safety of those additives. Most did not respond.

That’s probably because they’re either protecting the trade secrets of the businesses that make PFAS alternatives for treating food wraps and cartons—or they simply don’t know what’s in the treatments they buy from chemical makers or formulators industry watchers say.

Companies that manufacture formulate and supply PFAS-alternative products are worried about protecting confidential business information says Stacy Glass executive director of ChemFORWARD a nonprofit that promotes the use of safer chemicals.

“This space is supercompetitive” she says of the market for water- and grease-resistant coatings without PFAS. These businesses want “to keep their secret sauce secret.”

“What’s actually being used is not well known” agrees Franjevic who manages Clean Production Action’s GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals an online tool for companies to assess chemicals on the basis of their hazards and assist in the selection of safer substances.

For instance Georgia-Pacific maker of Dixie-brand paper products manufactures food ware with its trademarked Soak-Proof Shield which the company’s website says does not contain PFAS. In a fact sheet Clean Production Action and Toxic-Free Future describe the material as “an acrylic-based coating that does not contain silicone.” Replying to a C&EN query about the material a spokesperson for Georgia-Pacific says the information is “proprietary and confidential” declining to discuss the matter further.

WestRock which produces paperboard take-out containers offers products coated with its proprietary EnShield treatment which it says is fluorocarbon-free. WestRock did not respond to C&EN’s requests for comment.

Ahlstrom-Munksjö a Helsinki-based manufacturer of paper and other fiber products also won’t detail its PFAS replacements but executives are willing to describe the broad contours of its replacement effort.

The company sells products to paper converters that custom cut the material into sheets or smaller rolls. The converters’ customers include delicatessens fast-food chains and other food service companies. Ahlstrom-Munksjö has multiple sustainability goals including using locally sourced sustainable wood supplies; using efficient water management practices; and avoiding hazardous materials.

Officials at Ahlstrom-Munksjö say they saw early signs of a growing market for food packaging made without PFAS and launched the Grease-Gard FluoroFree products in 2019. The company makes the lightweight flexible paper at plants in Wisconsin and France. The paper is BPI certified.

“Part of the solution comes from the fiber we use” and how that fiber is processed says Zack Leimkuehler Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s vice president for technical solutions. Additives also play an important role he says and the company selects them with compostability in mind.

Some of the additives are plant based says Jeff Murphy Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s vice president for food packaging solutions. Others are food additives that are classified as generally recognized as safe by the FDA he says.

Some of Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s manufacturing sites were making grease-resistant food packaging material a century ago some 50 years before PFAS were approved for use on these products Leimkuehler says. “What we are doing is going back to a lot of what we did in the past.”

California-based Zume which makes molded-fiber food packaging is bucking the trend by disclosing its PFAS replacement technology which relies on products made by the specialty chemical company Solenis.

Zume began as a high-tech pizza company developing robotic equipment to make pizzas that were baked on delivery trucks. But the boxes it used to package its pies affected the quality of the product. So Zume focused on making a better pizza box. And it succeeded selling boxes to other pizza purveyors.

Zume then exited the pizza-making business in 2020 to focus exclusively on food packaging. It retooled its pizza-making robots to create fiber-based food packaging to replace single-use plastic items such as polystyrene clamshells.

“The big thing that we want to get rid of is single-use plastics” says Pam Horine Zume’s vice president of product research and compliance.

Zume once used short-chain PFAS to impart grease resistance to its US-made packaging Horine says. But earlier this year Zume and Solenis debuted a new method for making PFAS-free plates and bowls that relies instead on a biobased wax and new technology for manufacturing the containers. The wax and other additives are approved by the FDA for use as food-contact materials she says.

“This is not just swapping out chemicals” Horine says. “This is technological innovation.”

We know there are good alternatives out there. Stacy Glass executive director ChemFORWARD

Lingering concerns

Advocacy group representatives warn that simply claiming that a food wrapper or container is made without added PFAS falls short of what’s needed for sustainability and safety. “Just being PFAS-free is not enough” Franjevic says.

“We’re trying to avoid regrettable substitution” says Brown-West of the Environmental Defense Fund.

She refers to swapping out one chemical because of health or environmental concerns and using another substance that performs well but may still pose hazards. For example makers of thermal receipt paper stopped using bisphenol A a well-researched compound that mimics estrogen and started using the less-studied bisphenol S which is suspected of having similar adverse health effects to those of bisphenol A.

Companies need to champion the use of chemicals for which data show they are safer than alternatives that perform the same function Brown-West says.

To support chemical replacement efforts some nonprofit organizations want to help food-ware makers take a critical look at the alternatives to PFAS. They are offering hazard comparisons or third-party certifications of the safety of the chemicals used in goods such as food packaging. These groups protect the identities of the substances and details of hazard data that could be valuable to competitors.

One such group is ChemFORWARD which Glass cofounded to make hazard data about commercial chemicals and trade-named mixtures accessible while protecting trade secrets. This strategy allows companies to answer the question “Is it safe?” without disclosing to customers or the public the exact composition of ingredients Glass says.

Apple Nike and several grocery chains are part of ChemFORWARD. They are seeking actionable information about ingredients—and possible alternatives—for their products while avoiding regrettable substitution Glass says. ChemFORWARD promotes the use of circular materials which can be recycled as raw material for the same use or composted safely. The group is focused on three sectors: packaging consumer electronics and personal care products.

Chemical manufacturers and formulators producing PFAS-free treatments can benefit from listing their products and toxicity data in ChemFORWARD’s database Glass says because they can demonstrate to potential customers the safety profiles of their products.

As part of the Safe + Circular Materials Collaborative a partnership between ChemFORWARD and the Sustainable Packaging Coalition some food packaging products are undergoing assessment for inclusion in the ChemFORWARD database Glass says. For example Ahlstrom-Munksjö is running its PFAS-free packaging materials through this process according to a company spokesperson.

Other organizations meanwhile set publicly available criteria for making safety determinations for chemicals Franjevic says. “While you won’t know the identity of all the chemicals in there what you will know is that they meet certain minimum requirements for not being a regrettable substitute” she says.

Clean Production Action through its GreenScreen program is developing a product certification that will deem an item as both free of PFAS and as using what the organization calls “preferred” chemicals. It will launch this certification later in 2021. GreenScreen already certifies certain firefighting foams as tested to be free of both PFAS and other chemicals of high concern to human health and the environment.

And in July an international group of food service companies advocacy groups and technical experts launched an online tool called the Understanding Packaging Scorecard that looks beyond the chemicals used in production and assesses the entire life cycle of packaging materials. This tool is aimed at promoting a circular economy in which discarded items become raw material for producing new goods.

For food containers the Understanding Packaging Scorecard weighs factors such as the water needed to wash reusable dishes the compostability of items made from paper or other fiber and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation manufacture sorting and recycling of plastic containers.

Among its many criteria the scorecard considers whether packaging contains ingredients that the European Chemicals Agency and the UN Environment Programme call “chemicals of concern” including a number of PFAS.

The tool considers two aspects about chemicals of concern in food wraps and packaging says Brown-West of the Environmental Defense Fund one of the advocacy groups involved in the scorecard. One is whether any of these substances is intentionally added to food packaging and didn’t enter the product through environmental exposure. The other is the tendency of a chemical to migrate from food-contact materials into food or drinks.

All of the scorecards databases and other developments point to an expanding market for PFAS-free grease- and water-resistant technologies that are backed by safety data reviewed by third parties.

The identities of the ingredients in these food packaging products may remain protected by confidentiality claims.",,,,,,,,,,,,
WY,Weyerhaeuser,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15YnVja2hhbm5vbi5jb20vdXBzaHVyLWNvdW50eS15b3V0aC1jYW1wLXR1cm5zLXRhci1waXQtaW50by1ncmFzc3ktZ3JlZW4tc3BhY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Upshur County Youth Camp turns tar pit into grassy green space,"SELBYVILLE – The tar pit at the Upshur County Youth Camp has been transformed into a grassy field with an archery range and pavilions.

Assistant county administrator Tabatha Perry said the project came to fruition thanks to a $200000 a EPA Brownfields Cleanup Grant.

“The Buckhannon Chemical Company operated on that property back in the day from 1908 to 1935 and it produced charcoal wood alcohol and calcium acetate using air-tight kilns or ovens” Perry said. “They disposed of their byproduct which was pine tar. When the company moved off the property it was deeded over to the Upshur County Commission.”

In 1987 the EPA fenced off the area by putting a fabric material over the site but it wasn’t maintained so vegetation grew through the fabric.

“The county obtained a FOCUS assessment grant through the West Virginia Brownfields Program several years ago and Woody Martin a local resident who was also a huge asset to the project prepared a portion of the assessment which was then used to apply for the EPA grant to clean it up” Perry said.

The grant was obtained before Perry worked for the commission and the clean-up was one of the first things on her agenda when she started.

“This was one of my first projects” Perry said. “It was just 0.662 acres of the property that wasn’t used and the county wanted to be able to use it as a recreational space or open green space.”

According to a summary of the project Perry prepared with the assistance of Lydia Work Licensed Remediation Specialist it was determined that solidifying the free-flowing pine tar using Portland cement followed by covering the affected area with a permanent soil cover would eliminate the exposure to the identified contaminants of concern present at the site and achieve a cost-effective goal protective of human health and the environment.

The result is a new green space for visitors to the youth camp to enjoy.

“It’s a green grassy area but they also installed a backstop for an archery range and an open-air pavilion for everyone to enjoy” Perry said.

The camp also recently received $10000 grant from Weyerhaeuser for other repairs and improvements.

“We are going to put more metal roofs on cabins like we’ve been doing” said Greg Woody director of the Upshur County Youth Camp. “We’ve been trying to put new roofs on everything we can and this summer we reroofed two of our large shower houses up on the bank between the large cabins and that was with Weyerhaeuser grant money that was given to us last year.”

Woody said they’re always working on improvements to the camp.

“I’m kind of limited on time as to when I can do the work so I try to do it when I have extra help during the summer” Woody said. “When camps go out we try to jump right in and this round of Weyerhaeuser money is also probably going to go toward new roofs.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vZHJ5ZGVud2lyZS5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy92aXJnaW5pYS1nb2Rib3V0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Virginia Godbout | Obituaries,"Mrs. Virginia “Ginny” Godbout (née Huset) died peacefully at home on September 27th 2021 in Eleva WI at the age of 76.

WMB,Williams Companies,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzEwLzAyL2JldHRlci1kaXZpZGVuZC1zdG9jay10aGUtd2lsbGlhbXMtY29tcGFuaWVzLXZzLWVuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Dividend Stock: The Williams Companies vs. Enbridge,"Two of the best-known names in the midstream space. Is one of them better than the other? Yes by a little bit.

Midstream pipeline owners are out of favor today and offering investors big yields despite the still strong demand for the services they provide. Two high-yield names that might come up on your list here are The Williams Companies (WMB 0.15%) and Enbridge (ENB 1.18%). Which one is the better dividend stock? It's subtle but there is a winner in this contest.

1. The dividend comparison

Since the investment question here is centered on the dividend it makes sense to address the issue right up front. Williams' dividend yield is roughly 6.5%. Enbridge's yield is 6.6%. That's basically a toss-up for most investors although Enbridge has a slight edge.

The more interesting comparison is to be found in comparing dividend histories though. Enbridge has increased its dividend each and every year for 26 years putting it in the rarified Dividend Aristocrat space. Williams by comparison cut its dividend by nearly 70% in 2016. It has increased the payment each year since that cut but the dividend still isn't back to its previous level. To be fair that was a difficult time for the midstream sector including limited access to capital markets so the cut was probably a good move for the company. Williams was also tied up in an ugly acquisition situation at the time that ultimately went nowhere. So there was a lot going on and some of the pain was probably self-inflicted.

That was a long time ago however and Williams' dividend coverage ratio was a solid 1.8 times in the second quarter. Therefore it's unlikely the dividend will get cut again anytime soon. Still more conservative types who value reliability will clearly prefer Enbridge.

2. The core business

That said the businesses here are notably different. Williams is basically a natural gas pipeline operator which by its measure handles 30% of the natural gas in North America. That puts it in an interesting position since natural gas is expected to be a key source of energy as the world looks to shift away from dirtier options for power and industrial inputs most notably coal. And given its toll-taker business model it gets paid for the use of its expansive network so an investment here removes a lot of the vagaries of commodity price volatility. Basically it's a pretty consistent business tied to a sector of the energy space that's likely to see solid demand even as the world shifts toward cleaner energy options.

Enbridge is far more diverse owning a collection of oil pipelines (54% of EBITDA) natural gas pipelines (29%) a natural gas distribution business (14%) and renewable power projects (3%). For investors who appreciate the benefits of diversification Enbridge will probably be a better fit.

Since nearly half of its business is tied to natural gas and clean energy you aren't giving up too much on the clean energy transition here compared to Williams. Notably Enbridge claims to hold the No. 2 spot with regard to miles of natural gas pipeline and the No. 1 spot by volume in its natural gas distribution business. It's worth noting that Williams has clean energy plans but they aren't large enough to show up in its numbers just yet. Enbridge on the other hand has a collection of offshore wind projects in Europe that should increase renewable power beyond 3% of EBITDA in the coming years.

The fly in the ointment for some will be Enbridge's oil pipeline operations which are still very important. The thing is even as much as the world might like oil to go away that's not likely to happen for decades. So this is something of a cash cow business that can help to fund Enbridge's cleaner efforts. If you're looking for a natural gas investment Williams is the winner. However if you want a diversified energy play Enbridge comes out on top.

3. Growing the business and the dividend

Williams believes it can grow adjusted EBITDA at around 5% per year over the foreseeable future. That isn't a bad number and will likely come from a mix of internal development and acquisitions. The dividend should trail along with adjusted EBITDA growth. Enbridge is targeting distributable cash flow growth of between 5% and 7% with the dividend likely to rise at a similar pace. Internal investment and acquisitions are again the core of the story.

Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are obviously different metrics. However the dividend growth figures provide a common ground here and Enbridge comes out on top. And while the difference in dividend growth might seem slight at just a percentage point or two that adds up over time. For investors interested in a mix of yield and dividend growth Enbridge will have the edge.

Not an easy call but one name wins

When you sum up these three points Enbridge looks like the better option for most dividend investors. It would be overkill to suggest that it's a slam-dunk winner but all in it comes out on top for dividend history diversification and growth. If you are focused on natural gas you might prefer Williams of course but beyond that Enbridge appears to be the better long-term call here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vYnVpbHRpbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbmV1cm9kaXZlcnNpdHktZW1wbG95bWVudNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Neurodiversity In Employment: The Case For Hiring Neurodivergent Talent,"For most of her adult life Heather Austin found office life difficult. Colleagues became irritable when she asked a lot of questions and called her unreasonable when she’d ask them to not play music because it made it tough for her to focus. Sometimes Austin would cry when she felt overstimulated or overwhelmed only to be told that she shouldn’t take work so personally.

“I would hide anything that was hard and when I failed at things I just kept apologizing and repeating what [colleagues] told me that I had no excuse to be doing poorly at my job” Austin said.

Two years ago Austin discovered she was autistic. “It changed my life in all kinds of ways” including realizing why the office proved so uncomfortable. Equipped with this knowledge Austin began looking for a new job. The search led her to JPMorgan Chase and its Autism at Work program launched in 2015 — a program focused on hiring and supporting employees with autism.

Six months ago Austin began working at the bank’s Chicago office in its operations support department. She feels supported by her bosses and colleagues and by Rangam the organization that helps JPMorgan Chase with its Autism at Work program. (Austin is a Rangam employee contracted to work at JPMorgan Chase.)

“I am not ‘tolerated’” Austin said of her new workplace. “I am accepted and thought of as a person who like every other person on the planet has some challenges.”

And her boss loves her. “Heather is extremely focused and shares with us how much she enjoys her role” said Nuvia Vega operations manager. “Her focus allows her to provide high-quality work which is priceless to our business” Vega said adding that Austin consistently meets productivity rates.

This is the first in a three-part series on building a stronger tech workforce.

An Untapped Workforce

JPMorgan Chase’s Autism at Work program taps a hidden workforce: People who are neurodivergent. Their diagnoses include but are not limited to autism attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) dyslexia and social anxiety disorders. As many as 90 percent of adults with autism or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are unemployed or underemployed and 77 percent who are unemployed say they want to work according to 2016 National Autistic Society research.

Definitions Neurotypical: This refers to a person who is considered part of the normal variation in the human population. Essentially it is used to describe people who are not on the autism spectrum or have a developmental difference.

Neurodivergent: This describes a person who differs from what is considered typical thought patterns and behaviors. It can include diagnoses like autism ADHD social anxiety and dyslexia.

Neurodiversity: A descriptor for a group of people ranging from neurotypical and neurodivergent. As a relatively new term it is not preferred by everyone within the autism community.

Adults with ADHD or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder are 42 percent less likely to be employed full time than adults without the disorder according to a National Institutes of Health white paper on the subject.

Faced with a labor shortage and a desire to build a stronger tech workforce companies ranging from Google Cloud to SAP to Microsoft have launched programs to harness this underused talent. “Many companies are seeking out [neurodivergent] employees because of their unique skill sets and analytical skills” said Scott Allen a licensed clinical psychologist at Just Mind Counseling in Austin Texas who works with tech professionals who are affected by autism spectrum ADHD and related disorders.

Neurodivergent people “often have strengths that are paramount to the industry” Allen said. Among them: The ability to continue with a redundant task over time the need for predictability and rules central to coding ‘outside of the box’ thinking and the ability to focus on small details without being distracted by other stimuli.

“I am fully convinced that individuals with ASD will likely help solve many of our world’s problems” Allen said. “There is a level of pragmatism that helps take the emotions and stress out of decision making and also a level of creativity that leads to new and often better approaches.”

A Question of Disclosure

“It’s a different way of thinking” said Dawn Sizer owner of 3rd Element Consulting an IT consultancy based in Mechanicsburg Pennsylvania. “The average person might think in a linear fashion: If A plus B equals C then the outcome is going to be D” she said. People who are neurodivergent “don’t necessarily think that the outcome will be D” she explained. “That out-of-the-box thinking is really amazing in the IoT world.”

Two of Sizer’s 10 employees have autism and one has ADHD. The key idea here is that the employees feel comfortable enough to share their diagnoses. A neurodivergent person might well apply for and receive a position without the hiring manager ever knowing — and federal law prohibits hiring managers from asking any question around disabilities.

“I am not ‘tolerated.’ I am accepted and thought of as a person who like every other person on the planet has some challenges.”

Sizer ends initial interviews with this question: “Is there something that makes you unique or different that you’d like to share?” The question can give candidates the opportunity to disclose information about a diagnosis “and gives you the opportunity to change how you’re interviewing to suit that person and potentially get a really good employee” she said.

Self disclosure and self advocacy are “a huge theme” in working with adults on the autism spectrum said Allen of Just Mind. “It’s important for individuals to know when and whether to disclose keeping in mind that not disclosing also means that the worker may not be eligible for accommodations at work” he said.

Individuals who do share this information during interviews might fear discrimination (in the form of no job offer). Even so he considers it “especially vital” for people with ASD. “ASD or Asperger’s are often considered ‘hidden disabilities’ because they are often not immediately observable” he said.

Beyond the interview process tech companies must accept the soft-skill challenges that hires who are neurodivergent sometimes bring to the workplace Allen said. “Neurodiverse individuals can be quite assertive with opinions and points of view often struggle with reading nonverbal cues and lose sight of the ‘big picture’ due to focus on details” he said.

A Stronger Cybersecurity Team

Over the past several years Bank of America has hired dozens of professionals who are neurodivergent into tech roles said Craig Froelich chief information security officer at the Charlotte North Carolina-based financial services firm. The group has the highest rate of job-offer acceptance and a near 100 percent retention rate Froelich said.

Cybersecurity needs the problem-solving skills of people who are neurodivergent he said. “You’re trying to anticipate the actions of an adversary and being able to do that means having the best and brightest minds around the table” he said.

He recalled a conversation some years back with a Bank of America cryptographer a “spectacular” employee who holds several security-related patents. One day in the middle of a casual chat she revealed to Froelich that she was neurodivergent. “I was taken aback because I didn’t even know what that meant” he said.

After that the cryptographer who is on the autism spectrum has dyslexia and ADHD asked Froelich to send information on topics for discussion in advance of a meeting; as a person who is neurodivergent it would help her better prepare for meetings.

The conversation made Froelich wonder how many employees identified as neurodivergent but not publicly. He brought up the topic at an all-hands meeting with his 3000 employees. After the meeting his inbox flooded with replies from people who were neurodivergent or had neurodivergent family members interested in cybersecurity as a career. “I realized pretty quickly that neurodivergent teammates were already part of our workforce” he said.

The cybersecurity sector as a whole he added needs two and a half to three million people to fill the skills gap by the end of this year. “I wanted to see if we could tap into this as a new pipeline for recruiting talent” Froelich said. “That’s where the journey began.”

Bank of America partners with Philadelphia-based Neurodiversity in the Workplace to recruit and hire neurodivergent people. Working with the organization Bank of America has adjusted some recruiting and interviewing practices to suit the needs of neurodivergent people. For instance interviewers ask clear close-ended questions (answered with a yes or no) in order to extract the best information from neurodivergent candidates “and really unlock the powers they bring to the table” Froelich said.

Over the course of a week neurodivergent candidates also complete a series of projects so hiring managers can see how they relate to peers and to the project. Some adjustments for instance training managers to frame and ask questions in a very specific way have improved the hiring process for all employees he said.

“I have an innate ability to understand extremely complex processes in a fraction of the time that it takes others.”

Once on board support for some include quiet places to work noise-cancelling headphones and an employee resource group to support neurodiversity.

Froelich envisions the program expanding to include career pathing for neurodivergent talent. “We’re always thinking about how to do more but I want to be thoughtful” he said. “We are talking about real people and their lives and I want to make sure that we are doing this right.”

Such supports have helped employees like Carly Ott forge stable and successful careers. Ott who has been diagnosed with autism has worked at Bank of America for 11 years. Prior to that her longest engagement at any company had been about 18 months. “I’d get hired identify all the process gaps improve them get bored then find an entirely different job in an entirely different industry” said Ott now vice president and senior operations project manager at Bank of America.

Ott credits her tenure to two factors one of which is her own talent. “I have an innate ability to understand extremely complex processes in a fraction of the time that it takes others” she said. “I can not only grasp the big picture but slice and dice requirements to cover all of the nuances” to the point where she has trouble separating strategy from tactics. “In my brain they’re the same” Ott said.

The other is Bank of America’s “incredibly supportive” leadership team. “They’re cognizant that communication differences may exist and we have a two-way open-door policy to bring up possible miscommunications openly” she said.

A Sense of Belonging

Out of New Relic’s 2200 global employees 10 percent or 235 people say they are neurodivergent or allies of the neurodiverse community said Tracy Williams chief people and diversity officer at the San Francisco-based developer of cloud-based software. “New Relic strives to embed belonging throughout the employee lifecycle” Williams said.

It starts with the job interview. New Relic’s HR people organize a “candidate’s choice” interview that connects candidates to an existing employee in a community for which they feel an affinity or whom they feel represents them. “The first people you meet are essential to fostering a sense of belonging” Williams said. “Through candidate choice interviews and other innovative practices we are working to ensure that talented candidates start to feel a sense of comfort and belonging even before their first day” she said.

Management touches to further that sense of belonging include a focus on micro-interactions. Employees can ask their managers for support in gaining the floor during a meeting taking time to process feedback or blocking out uninterrupted time to work.

Accommodations reinforcing the sense of belonging include large meetings enabled with closed captioning. Employees can request live captioning during video meetings. The company strives to make lighting adjustable wherever possible in work spaces conference rooms and drop-in spaces Williams said.

Different workspace configurations from collaborative areas with modular furniture to small spaces for quiet work meet the needs of all workers. Wellness rooms in many global offices also offer completely private spaces to take a break she said.

“Through candidate choice interviews and other innovative practices we are working to ensure that talented candidates start to feel a sense of comfort and belonging even before their first day.”

One of New Relic’s five employee resource groups Neu Relics was created in 2018 by neurodivergent employees to support the neurodiverse community and allies. The group hosts talks events and workshops for the entire company and plans bigger events for Mental Health Awareness Month each May. This year the group brought in a consultant to host a company-wide workshop on managing stress and burnout.

After listening and tuning into the conversations from the ERG New Relic management offered all employees a week off called Relic Recharge Week in early August. “The daily kindnesses that neurodiversity awareness brings are an important part of the experience at New Relic” Williams said.

A Useful Partner

JPMorgan Chase piloted Autism at Work in Delaware with four initial employees. By their sixth month of employment the four worked 48 percent faster and were as much as 92 percent more productive than their neurotypical peers said Ramon Heredia Autism at Work program lead for JPMorgan Chase’s Chicago market which has 20 employees who are neurodivergent. The four employees were also more likely to check in daily with their managers to chart progress and spot points for improvement.

That initial success prompted the bank to expand the program. The bank now employs about 250 people through the Autism at Work program a group that boasts a 90 percent annual retention rate. Their roles range from personal banker to managing director to equipment operators like Heather Austin.

“It all goes to their capabilities and what they’re interested in” said Heredia stressing that neurodiversity is a broad spectrum. “When you’ve met one person with autism you’ve met one person with autism” he said.

How to Accommodate Neurodivergent Employees “Be direct in communication. Provide agendas and presentations in advance for people to prepare for meetings. Make sure fonts contrast with backgrounds and the most important information is at least 18-point type. These small things make interactions easier for everyone and can make a huge difference for your colleagues who are on the outside edges of the neurodiversity bell curve.” — Carly Ott vice president and senior operations project manager Bank of America

“Look at your internal culture. Do you have training in place for all leaders to look at different abilities and differences as a benefit to your company? Also do you have a solid accommodations process that will assist those with differences to fulfill and meet their potential as opposed to discouraging them from even asking? Most disability accommodations cost a company less than $500 and for autism that drops to less than $100 if not free.” — Carly Ott Bank of America

“Much of the hiring comes down to the interview and job posting. Many job postings out there are tone-deaf as to what skills are needed and who should apply (i.e. those infamous “entry level” postings that require 3+ years’ experience). The interview process doesn’t have to be stressful either! If there aren’t five people watching your screen after you are hired you shouldn’t judge somebody on how they code in front of five people.” — Scott McKell software engineering consultant Salt Lake City Utah

Working with Rangam the bank has adjusted its interviewing and onboarding process for neurodiverse candidates. They first tour the working floor to observe the kind of work they would do and inspect the office environment to see if it might trigger sensitivity issues. “We have a conversation with the candidate about how they feel about the role and the environment” Heredia said. “We have a huge understanding of the importance of accommodations.”

Interview questions are trimmed down; for instance an interviewer might ask about a candidate’s last two years of experience rather than the broad “tell me about yourself” question. They also avoid hypothetical questions in favor of direct questions related to work experience education and transferable skills.

“Companies should really be looking at hiring a neurodiverse workforce. They’ll find an untapped pipeline of simply brilliant people — highly educated highly capable detail-oriented.”

Once hired on-the-job accommodations range from noise-cancelling headphones low lighting seating in low-traffic areas stress balls (palm-sized rubber balls that can alleviate stress when squeezed) and even a raccoon tail for employees to simulate petting of a housepet. During reviews representatives from Rangam might sit in to help talent understand what’s needed to progress. “Sometimes they feel more comfortable because of the relationship” with Rangam Heredia said.

Neurodivergent employees can quickly become subject-matter experts prompting colleagues to regard them as invaluable resources Heredia said. Their presence has encouraged some employees to speak openly about their own diagnoses too. “They come forward and say ‘I’ve been struggling with this because I’ve never felt comfortable about disclosing but I do now because of the shift I see in the culture’” Heradia said.

Eight thousand JPMorgan Chase employees and managers have completed an autism awareness course which trains managers on best management practices for neurodivergent employees. One example: Breaking down instructions and questions to basic components so they may be easily understood. “These things don’t require a massive change to the business and they end up being beneficial for everyone not just neurodivergent individuals” he said.

Neurodivergent employees also benefit from support circles consisting of a job coach a buddy or community mentor to help them navigate company culture as well as the larger neurodivergent community — either a formal cohort or other people who were previously hired through the program Heredia said.

“Companies should really be looking at hiring a neurodiverse workforce” Heredia said. “They’ll find an untapped pipeline of simply brilliant people — highly educated highly capable detail-oriented.

During her first TV interview with Deborah Roberts Anna (Delvey) Sorokin said she ""would like to show the world that I'm not this dumb greedy person.""

NEW YORK -- The Anna Sorokin story is a tale of a young woman who decided to be someone else and became that person - but at an enormous cost.

Dubbed names like the ""fake heiress"" the ""Soho scammer"" the ""Soho grifter"" Sorokin assumed the name Anna ""Delvey"" and pretended to be a German heiress with a $67 million trust fund according to prosecutors.

Prosecutors argued Sorokin used that fake identity to swindle Manhattan's elite gaining access to exclusive parties nightclubs and hotels until her deception came to light. She defrauded hotels restaurants a private jet operator and banks out of around $275000 during a 10-month spree prosecutors alleged.

So who is the real Sorokin?

""That's a loaded question"" Sorokin told ABC News senior national affairs correspondent Deborah Roberts. ""I would like to show the world that I'm not this dumb greedy person that they portrayed me to be.""

Anna Sorokin is seen here during an interview with ""20/20.""

The 30-year-old was convicted in May 2019 on eight counts including grand larceny attempted grand larceny and theft of services. She was sentenced to four to 12 years in prison fined $24000 and ordered to pay nearly $200000 in restitution.

She served just under four years and was released on good behavior in February.

In reality Sorokin who is Russian-born but lived in Germany comes from a middle class family. She arrived in New York City in 2013 in her 20s. Eventually Sorokin convinced people from friends to financial institutions that she was a wealthy socialite and a jetsetter picking up tabs and often paying in cash -- living a glamorous and expensive life which she seemed to flaunt on Instagram and Twitter.

As for the fake name ""Delvey"" Sorokin said ""I just came up with it.""

Sorokin's plan when she moved to Manhattan was to set up a high-end members-only arts club according to her former defense attorney Todd Spodek.

""Arts fashion entertainment music restaurants everything in one place"" he said. ""The name of this was the Anna Delvey Foundation the ADF.""

But Sorokin said she never claimed to be an heiress and never claimed to come from money. She said she ""always knew"" she couldn't afford a lavish jet-setting lifestyle and knew she couldn't pay back money she said she borrowed from others but said she was ""trying to fix that"" before her 2017 arrest.

Spodek her defense attorney at trial argued that Sorokin did nothing wrong that she simply exploited a system easily seduced by glitz and glamour and told little white lies along the way.

""Anna had every intention of doing things the right way but she couldn't open those doors without doing something a little bit grey to open the door"" he said. ""Everyone creates the version of themselves that they want the world to see... Everyone lies when it's convenient to them... and Anna did the same thing. She couldn't be 100% honest because no one would listen to her.""

""I never had a fraudulent intent"" Sorokin said. ""And I guess that's what should really count.""

Her former friend Rachel DeLoache Williams said she was among the many people Sorokin betrayed. Williams recounted her experience in an interview with ABC News as well as in her new book ""My Friend Anna: The True Story of a Fake Heiress.""

Williams said she met Sorokin in a Manhattan nightclub. At the time Williams was a 28-year-old photo editor for Vanity Fair. She said her first impression of Sorokin was that she was ""slightly offbeat.""

""People have asked [ me ]  were there red flags?"" Williams said.""I never questioned that she was who she said she was. I never had reason to and I wouldn't have thought that way.""

Williams said that Sorokin often picked up the tab treating her to fancy dinners $300 private fitness sessions and infrared sauna treatments.

Then in spring 2017 Williams said Sorokin offered her an all-expenses-paid trip to Morocco. On the trip together however Sorokin's credit cards mysteriously stopped working.

""I guess they gave me [ the ] impression that they pre-authorized my card or something like that"" Sorokin said.

Fearful of being stranded in a foreign country Williams said she agreed to offer her credit cards -- her personal and company corporate card -- when asked as a temporary backup even though she could not afford it.

"" [ The hotel ] said to me 'Do you have a credit card?' So I look at Anna and she's like 'Can we just use it for now?'"" Williams said.

After she left Morocco and landed back in the U.S. Williams said she learned the total amount was $62000.

""She owed me more money than I made in a year"" she said.

Sorokin told ABC News she intended to pay Williams back though she knew she didn't yet have the money. But as time went on Williams was panicking.

""I am late with my rent"" Williams said. ""I'm late with my credit card payments.""

Rachel Williams speaks to ABC News about her former friendship with convicted con-woman Anna Sorokin.

Unrelated to the Morocco trip Sorokin was arrested in July 2017 for theft of services when she couldn't pay her high-end Manhattan restaurant and hotel bills. Following her arraignment in court Sorokin took off for California.

Meanwhile Williams realizing she had been duped went to the police and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. After Sorokin missed a court date Williams ended up aiding investigators in a sting operation that eventually led to Sorokin's second arrest in October 2017 in Malibu California.

When she was arrested Sorokin was extradited back to New York City and taken to Rikers Island Jail where she was held for 19 months.

According to her former defense attorney Sorokin was offered a plea deal of a three to nine-year prison sentence to resolve all criminal liability but turned it down.

""I wanted to go to trial"" she said. ""I felt like it was the only way to tell my story.""

Williams testified against Sorokin at her 2019 trial and said it was the most traumatic moment of her life.

""I understand the word trauma is relative"" Williams said. ""To have someone that I had put so much goodwill into turn out to just be like a liar and who had willfully hurt me was very painful.""

Though Sorokin was found guilty on eight counts she was acquitted on two including the most serious charge against her which was attempting to steal more than $1 million from a bank. She was also acquitted of theft relating to Williams' $62000 credit card bill which Williams said was ""extremely devastating.""

Following an investigation into the Moroccan resort charges Williams' credit card company forgave a bulk of her debt though she was still required to pay back some of the expenses incurred.

When Sorokin heard the verdict she said she decided to ""just deal with the consequences.""

""What am I supposed to collapse and cry?"" she said. ""They're whatever 50 100 cameras in my face? So I don't know. It's just like-- it's really hard for me to like cry on demand.""

Sorokin sold the rights to her story to Netflix and Shonda Rimes but because New York state law doesn't allow criminals to profit from their crimes the money from the deal had to first be used to pay her victims back.

Anna Sorokin seen here moments after her release from prison in Feb. 2021.

After her February prison release Sorokin's Instagram was back up and running featuring photos of her drinking champagne from a claw-footed tub and seeming to be living the good life.

Sorokin is now back in jail currently in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody and could face deportation. But she is determined to stay in the U.S.

So what's next for Anna Sorokin?

""I guess it remains to be seen"" she said. ""I'm just trying to rewrite my story.""

""The 609 loophole is a section of the Fair Credit Reporting Act that says that if something is incorrect on your credit report you have the right to write a letter disputing it"" said Robin Saks Frankel a personal finance expert with Forbes Advisor.

The theory works that a credit bureau will remove a specific mark if it can't be proven. This is a good thing if there is a legitimate error on your report.

But some YouTubers and credit repair companies are promising to use the 609 loophole to wipe off actual debts people owe without paying them.

It's done by writing what's referred to as 609 letters to remove old addresses from your account. Then additional letters are written saying debt connected to those addresses is not connected to you. So the credit bureaus must remove it. But Saks Frankel said it's really a waste of time.

""It doesn't matter how you submit it. There's no magic formula and combination of words that is going to suddenly make your debt go away"" Saks Frankel said.

Even if you manage to get an address removed debt is still connected to you in other ways like Social Security numbers so the debt is still there when you apply for loans or credit cards.

""The best way to repair your credit unfortunately takes time"" Saks Frankel said. ""You're not going to go from a horrible credit score to an excellent credit score in six months.""

The first step in raising your score: check for reporting errors and use the so-called 609 letters for their actual purpose.

You can get a free report every year from each of the three bureaus at AnnualCreditReport.com.

The second step is to ""start with something like a secured credit card"" said Saks Frankel. You deposit the amount of money you want to borrow and after building up a history with the lender you can get that money back or swap to a normal credit card.

It's important to remember that the things credit repair agencies say they can do for you you can do for yourself and for free.",,,

Say hello to curling the next competitive sport in Las Vegas

Shrewd move MGM.

Last week the largest employer on the Strip made the surprise announcement that it’s acquiring the operations of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for $1.625 billion.

It’s part of a larger $5.65 billion real estate deal for Blackstone with a method in vogue in the gaming industry these days: A group of investors is buying the real estate beneath The Cosmopolitan and MGM is getting the operations piece.

In turn under the 30-year contract that has three 10-year options MGM would pay $200 million annual rent to the investment group which includes a Blackstone real estate investment trust and the family trust of the founders of Panda Express.

The Blackstone Group picked up The Cosmopolitan seven years ago for $1.73 billion so it’s netting a nice profit. Former MGM CEO Jim Murren pitched the idea of buying The Cosmopolitan years ago but nothing came of it until last week.

The deal still has to pass regulatory muster probably in early 2022 but Brendan Bussmann director of government affairs for Las Vegas-based Global Market Advisors thinks it will happen.

“The average visitor saw Cosmo as part of the CityCenter complex” Bussmann said. “Now you will be able to create some true synergies between this side of the Strip from Bellagio south.”

A clever deal

The deal is smart on so many levels.

MGM gets to maintain its “assets-light” strategy that the company initiated five years ago. The company has to pay annual rent and generate revenue from the casino the hotel and all of the other assets in the building.

Once The Cosmopolitan deal is done MGM would have only one property — MGM Springfield in Massachusetts — that the company would own. But in regulatory hearings company officials have said a real estate company would buy Springfield by the end of the year which would make MGM the tenant at 100 percent of its resorts.

MGM gets its fair share of customer traffic from the mature well-established baby boomer. Now the company can mine a younger generation as The Cosmopolitan since it opened in 2010 has become a hipster haven.

While The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas is considered a luxury hotel there’s no doubt MGM could persuade some of its new younger customers to move up to the likes of Bellagio through loyalty programs.

Check out the geography of the deal.

From north to south MGM’s holdings down Las Vegas Boulevard would include Bellagio Cosmopolitan CityCenter — Aria and the nongaming Vdara — Park MGM New York-New York Excalibur Luxor and Mandalay Bay.

Everything is pretty much side by side on the west side of the Strip except for one isolated property The Mirage.

The company’s lone property on the east side of the boulevard: MGM Grand.

The Caesars lineup

Now look at its biggest competitor Caesars Entertainment Inc. It’s established the same way on the east side of the Strip with Harrah’s Las Vegas The Linq Flamingo The Cromwell Bally’s Paris Las Vegas and Planet Hollywood.

The lone property on the west side of the Strip: Caesars Palace the company’s flagship and best-known asset.

Caesars also has the advantage of easy access to a transit system it didn’t have to build the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority-owned Las Vegas Monorail. If a major portion of the gaming industry’s future is in group sales for conventions and trade shows Caesars is all set: There’s a Monorail stop at the massive Las Vegas Convention Center and the company’s not-even-broken-in Caesars Forum.

MGM’s acquisition of The Cosmopolitan gives it 3000 recently renovated rooms right near where MGM had envisioned another hotel tower.

Remember the Harmon Hotel the 400-room building with an additional 267 condominium residences and a spa?

It was the last planned property at CityCenter but it was doomed by construction defects and unceremoniously dismantled instead of being imploded like so many classic Vegas resorts. A court case in a civil lawsuit relieved both MGM and its contractor of paying what probably would have been a nine-figure settlement.

One other outcome of MGM’s purchase is that it blocked a potential new Strip competitor. It’s been well-reported that a potential buyer for a place on the Strip is Hard Rock International a gaming company owned by Florida’s Seminole Indian Tribe.

The Seminoles are looking to make a bid to be the third tribal entity to take up residency in Las Vegas but they want to be on Las Vegas Boulevard unlike the off-Strip Virgin Hotels Las Vegas — casino operated by Mohegan Gaming and Entertainment — and the Palms being purchased by the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians of California. Incidentally the San Manuel group made a big move this month hiring a former MGM executive Cynthia Kiser Murphey as its general manager once that transaction closes later this year.

As luck would have it the CEOs of Hard Rock International Jim Allen and MGM Bill Hornbuckle will join Wynn Resorts Ltd. CEO Matt Maddox on the same stage Wednesday for a panel discussion on gaming issues at the Global Gaming Expo.

Here’s hoping they talk about some of these deals that are transforming the Strip.

As billionaires try to beat each other by shooting themselves into space there’s plenty of movement in space tourism for us plebes that don’t have our own rocket companies to promote. From Disney to Vegas space seems to be the hottest new theme in tourism.We’re still years possibly decades away from affordable and accessible off-Earth tourism  but in the meantime there’s a wave of new space-themed tourism experiences.The highest-profile projects are both at Walt Disney World. After unprecedented delays the Space 220 restaurant opened last week at EPCOT. Themed as a space station located 220 miles above Orlando the themed dining experience is akin to the California Grill or Coral Reef but with large hyper-real projections of Earth. The new restaurant is also one of the most realistic looks to date of how a space elevator would work. Like its precursor the hydrolators at The Living Seas the Stellarvator  as the space elevator is referred to has obvious issues that keep it from being too authentic.The same is true for the upcoming Stars Wars: Galactic Starcruiser that’s set to debut next year. Using similar hyperreal simulated windows the Starcruiser will give guests the experience of a cruise ship in space. That idea is nothing new but with cutting-edge technology and a dedication to ensuring thematic consistency throughout the three-day two-night ‘cruise’ the Starcruiser will be for many the closest they’ve come to a space vacation. Disney is also planning a Star Wars-themed bar on its upcoming cruise ship that will offer a similar window into space.This isn't Florida's first space attraction. Since the early days of launches at Cape Canaveral the Kennedy Space Center has helped connect to the U.S. space program. In nearby Titusville a science-focused Mars-themed resort was proposed . The project known as INTERSPACE Florida was a mix between a research facility a multi-day resort and a science museum. Originally pitched in 2008 INTERSPACE was delayed until 2014 due to the Great Recession. Despite being more than a decade old the project has many of the same features as projects now being pushed forward. A funding round raised more than $15 million for the project but it was never realized. Project co-founder Joseph Palaia confirmed to the Orlando Weekly the project was canceled due to a lack of funding. ""Unfortunately at the time we were unable to close on the needed investment and I and my cofounder moved on with our lives. Indeed it was an idea that was before its time.""But by far the most ambitious simulated space tourism project is a new resort announced for Las Vegas. Using a building technique nearly identical to that of Space Mountain the new casino resort will have a central tower that supports a massive 735-foot tall Moon-shaped building the largest replica of the Moon ever attempted. Inside guests will have hotel rooms with views of the lunar surface and there will be a spacious area for guests to explore the simulated lunar surface.Some think the highly publicized Moon resort expected to cost $5 billion will go the same route as the Titusville project. Scott Roeben of Vegas news site Vital Vegas is one of those skeptics. He sees the recent trend in space-themed tourist attractions as a link to recent launches and unusual theming. “I think over-the-top announcements are always fun to talk about and this story is over the moon in terms of how ludicrous it is. Beyond the outlandish element space is a thing at the moment. Every billionaire is blasting themselves into space so it's in the zeitgeist despite this particular project being complete science fiction.”Roeben acknowledges Vegas has always had a unique fascination with space including previous proposals for a Moon-themed resort aptly named ‘ Moon World .’ This specific project seems unlikely to him due to the location costs and design concept. “The proposed site appears to be on land owned by Wynn Resorts and I can guarantee there is no price where they'd let what is arguably a tacky monstrosity be built on that site. I know buzzkill.” He admits the bars at Moon would interest but quickly adds “unfortunately this project has zero hope of ever existing. It's pure whimsy.” A second Moon resort is proposed for Dubai.In 2016 a concept similar to the doomed Titusville one was proposed for Vegas . It would’ve simulated Mars inside a massive dome nearly as tall as Giza's Great Pyramid. Circling the simulated surface would be a large retail and entertainment complex. That project now seems stalled as well. It comes as no surprise to Roeben as he notes “Vegas is about big dreams and the vast majority are of the pipe variety.”Tourists have long been fascinated with space. One of Coney Island’s most successful early attractions was a simulated ride to the Moon . That attraction had debuted at the Pan-American Exposition in 1901 where guests paid double the price of other attractions. The steep cost didn't deter guests with it ranking as one of the most popular exhibits at the expo. similar attraction opened at Disneyland in 1955 where it too saw large crowds. Epcot’s Mission: Space adding the thrill of the G-forces to a space attraction opened at Epcot in 2003. In a post-ride area  guests can explore Mars via a computer simulation.There’s also a push towards actual space tourism. In Las Vegas there are plans for a spaceport just outside the city though Roeben thinks this is yet another pipe dream due in large part to the city’s lack of qualified workers. Back in Florida Brevard County is trying to keep its space supremacy with a proposal to change the county's name to Space Coast in an attempt to better market the region. Numerous companies have now set goals of having regular space tourism trips by the end of the decade with many of the projects launching from Brevard County.Earlier this year Virgin Galactic made news when it scooped up one of Disney's most recognizable Imagineers Joe Rohde. In his new role Rohde is tasked with ensuring a seamless experience for tourists visiting space from Virgin Galatic's custom-built hyper-luxury spaceport in New Mexico.In the 1980s when EPCOT was new it was the first introduction for many guests to the global cultures celebrated within it. Since then access to those distant nations has become far easier for many. Similarly Space 220 will be the first ‘taste’ of space many guests encounter. But with dozens of other space-themed attractions and authentic space tourism proposals moving forward in a few decades the restaurant may feel as outdated as the land formerly known as Future World.For now space is reserved for the smartest and wealthiest. Maybe one day that won’t be the case but in the meantime there’s always Disney and Vegas pipe dreams.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL2RhbmNpbmdhc3Ryb25hdXQuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvZXhwZXJpZW5jZS1wZWdneS1nb3UtdGhlLW1hcnRpbmV6LWJyb3RoZXJzLXNnLWxld2lzLWFuZC1tb3JlLWF0LW5ldy1ob3VzZS1hbmQtdGVjaG5vLWdldGF3YXktZnJhbWV3b3JrLWNhYm8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Experience Peggy Gou The Martinez Brothers SG Lewis and more at new house and techno getaway Framework Cabo,"Experience Peggy Gou The Martinez Brothers SG Lewis and more at new house and techno getaway Framework Cabo

Simply sign up to the Exchange traded funds myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

Up to a quarter of the revenues generated by the constituent companies of exchange traded funds focused on US stocks are derived from sales to China according to research by Bank of America.

The analysis demonstrates how difficult it is for investors to avoid the fallout from Beijing’s crackdown on a swath of private sector activities.

“What happens in China doesn’t stay in China” BofA said with the correlation between earnings per share growth in the US S&P 500 and Chinese economic growth surging from zero in 2010 to 90 per cent exceeding the importance of US gross domestic product growth for US-listed stocks.

About 30 per cent of global GDP growth over the past two decades has come from China greater than the 21 per cent from the US while almost 80 per cent of the S&P 500’s margin expansion since 1990 has been driven by globalisation the bank added.

BofA found that 79 S&P 500 companies generate at least 5 per cent of their revenues from China a figure rising to 63 per cent for casino operator Las Vegas Sands and 70 per cent for rival Wynn Resorts both heavily focused on the Macau gaming market.

Next highest were chipmakers Qualcomm at 60 per cent and Texas Instruments (55 per cent) followed by laser developer IPG Photonics (42 per cent).

Globally it identified 303 listed companies with total market capitalisation in excess of $19tn that generate at least 5 per cent of their revenue from China.

Separate analysis by Jared Woodard head of the research investment committee at BofA found that — based on their holdings of these 303 companies — 138 of the 251 ETFs the bank covers generated at least 3 per cent of their underlying revenue from China.

Apart from China-focused funds emerging market ETFs were the most exposed with their constituents typically deriving between 25 and 45 per cent of their revenues from the country.

However even some ETFs focused purely on US-listed stocks were found to have high exposures led by the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) whose constituents generate 27.9 per cent of their revenues from China according to BofA’s numbers.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) is not far behind at 25.8 per cent with VanEck Low Carbon Energy ETF (SMOG) which tracks a global index at 19.1 per cent and the First Trust Nasdaq 100 Technology Sector Index fund (QTEC) at 16.6 per cent.

“A lot of US companies have built up quite a lot of dependence on revenues from China” Woodard said. “Investors may not be aware. People know the mandates of the funds they buy usually but what they might not know is that companies around the world have become increasingly dependent on China.”

The figures might even understate ETFs’ exposure to China. Some funds will hold companies that derive some revenue from China but less than the 5 per cent threshold used in BofA’s analysis meaning their contribution is missed. In addition not all companies disclose the full geographic breakdown of their sales Woodard said.

The research also only covered revenues emanating from China not other potential vulnerabilities such as supply chains.

“Revenue exposure is something we can measure [but] that is just one reflection of their relationship. [Via] broader trade labour pools there are a host of ways that means economies around the world are more connected than before” Woodard added.

His analysis found that some of the ETFs with little exposure to China have outperformed comparable China-centric funds by as much as 37 percentage points since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020.

The gaps are particularly large for consumer discretionary funds where some ETFs hold China-dependent casino education and luxury stocks while others do not.

The gaps are also notable for funds following an environmental social and governance mantra and those focused on emerging markets.

While every stock market has its ups and downs Woodard argued that China’s current combination of long-term concerns around issues such as demographics and potential growth cyclical headwinds such as tight monetary policy and “political interventions in the name of common prosperity” means “the risk may be greater than the rewards”.

Kenneth Lamont senior fund analyst for passive strategies at Morningstar said the analysis underscored the need for investors to be aware of what is in the funds they hold.

“The geographical location of a company is somewhat arbitrary. It’s not necessarily linked with where it makes its money. Shell and BP are listed in the UK but that’s not where the bulk of their revenues are coming from” Lamont said.

“American companies tend to have a fairly large domestic footprint because they have a large internal market but in a globalised world we are all dependent to some degree on how well China is doing.”

BofA also noted that since 2017 mutual funds had gone from having an equal weight position in the US companies with top decile exposure to China to being more than 10 percentage points underweight.

ETFs being overwhelmingly passive do not have the scope to follow suit even though these stocks trade at near-record 25 per cent premium to their peers according to BofA.

Rahul Sen Sharma managing partner of Indxx an index provider said “only time will tell” whether active managers’ decision to underweight US stocks heavily exposed to China pays off.

“We will have to see how the returns stack up over the long term. Passive investment usually wins out over active” he said.

Lamont agreed saying “next week something might change and these active managers will be caught off guard.

“Sometimes [active management] pays off and sometimes it doesn’t. Maybe it will pay off this time but most active managers don’t make enough calls right over time.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Nhc2lub3MtZ2FtaW5nL2dsb2JhbC1nYW1pbmctZXhwby10by1vZmZlci12YXN0LWRpc3BsYXktb2Ytc2xvdHMtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbnMtMjQ1MjI0My_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV2aWV3am91cm5hbC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvY2FzaW5vcy1nYW1pbmcvZ2xvYmFsLWdhbWluZy1leHBvLXRvLW9mZmVyLXZhc3QtZGlzcGxheS1vZi1zbG90cy1pbm5vdmF0aW9ucy0yNDUyMjQzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global Gaming Expo to offer vast display of slots innovations,"A wide array of casino gadgets will be on display beginning Tuesday at the American Gaming Association’s four-day pandemic-delayed industry showcase.

International Game Technology Chief Operating Officer of Gaming for IGT Nick Khin and Senior Director of Core Product Roger Pettersson talk about what people can expect from their company at the Global Gaming Expo 2021 conference in Las Vegas.

If there ever was a slot machine supermarket it would be G2E.

Beginning this week gaming industry professionals will gather at The Venetian Expo to see hear and touch what gaming manufacturers say will be the next generation of casino gadgetry designed to keep players more engaged — and to spend more of their entertainment dollar.

Leaders of the American Gaming Association operators of G2E — the Global Gaming Expo — say quality not quantity will be the emphasis of this year’s show.

It’s the largest gaming trade show in the world and over the next four days buyers will be perusing the devices that promise to engage players through new technologies or experiences.

Smaller show

Knowing of the challenges of international travel during the coronavirus pandemic AGA President and CEO Bill Miller isn’t expecting that the 27000 people who usually attend G2E will all show up when the doors open Monday.

“My strong belief is that the mix of people that we have exhibiting and attending will be economically valuable and significant” Miller said in an interview.

“Measuring the success of this G2E based on numbers would not be important” he said. “What I’ve been encouraged by is that the exhibitors have been excited. It’s been two years since they’ve been able to show off in a live manner new technologies new platforms and new entertainment. That is something you can’t replicate in a Zoom call.”

And many participants agree.

“It’s a big deal this year given we didn’t have an in-person G2E last year” said Mike Gatten senior vice president of slot strategy for MGM Resorts International. “There’s something to be said for being able to have hands on and actually play the games and touch and feel and experience that stuff in a more physical environment. It is still the marquee gaming trade show and is the granddaddy of them.”

Gatten is one of those with the authority to make purchases and he and a contingent of MGM slot managers will be on the show floor that opens Tuesday seeking devices that will engage customers.

Among the features Gatten likes most about G2E is that he can comparison shop and that he also gets the chance to see offerings from smaller companies that might not be headquartered in Southern Nevada. It’s easy for him to see the newest buzzworthy machines by paying a visit to the showrooms of IGT Scientific Games Aristocrat and a host of others with a solid Las Vegas presence.

Return to normal

“It is important that G2E happen this year especially as the industry continues to be one of the leaders on health and safety measures for its guests and staff” said Brendan Bussmann director of government affairs for Las Vegas-based Global Market Advisors.

“It is time to start moving things back to normal and emerge from the great shutdown. I look forward to getting together with the colleagues that are able to make it to the show this year. It is however unfortunate that many of our international friends could not join us this year even though they were vaccinated and under the same protocols that we are here.”

Debating the issues

So G2E is a gaming industry shopping mall and a gathering place for professionals. What else?

Miller said it is an opportunity to debate industry issues and to bring in keynote speakers to discuss important topics.

“This is not a symbolic event” Miller said. “There will be conversations about industry growth including sports betting digital payments and payment modernization. The gaming industry is also a leader in inclusions and we’ll have a keynote panel dedicated to that.”

Tuesday afternoon there will be a panel on how casino companies can prioritize diversity. The three speakers are MGM Resorts International Chief People Inclusion and Sustainability Officer Jyoti Chopra; U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Suzanne Clark; and Marriott International Senior Vice President Multicultural Affairs Social Impact and Business Councils Apoorva Gandhi. MSNBC’s Contessa Brewer will moderate the discussion.

That same day Miller will deliver a state of the industry address and Gov. Steve Sisolak and Rep. Dina Titus D-Nev. will take the stage to discuss recovering from the pandemic.

A panel Wednesday will feature Brewer moderating a session with CEOs from three companies weighing in on several industry topics with MGM Resorts International’s Bill Hornbuckle and Wynn Resorts Ltd.’s Matt Maddox participating. Representing the tribal perspective will be Hard Rock International’s Jim Allen whose company is operated by Florida’s Seminole Indian Tribe.

The keynote parade will end Wednesday with Miller interacting with Arizona Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill.

“It’s a great lineup of speakers and I think it is because there’s a lot going on in the industry and clearly we’ve gone through a pretty tough 18 months” Miller said.

There may even be a celebrity or two.

“Wheel of Fortune” star Vanna White is scheduled to conduct a charity celebrity slot tournament where $15000 will go to several causes. It’s all part of IGT’s celebration of the “Wheel of Fortune” slot brand turning 25 years old this year.

‘It’s Game Time’

But in the end it’s mainly all about the massive display of new slots table games and other devices.

“Our theme is ‘It’s Game Time.’ I think it’s a really really appropriate theme for us because I think this is a really big year for products we’ll be showing” said Nick Khin IGT’s chief operating officer for gaming.

“This year’s a special year because a lot of the products and solutions we’re going to be showing are going to have a big impact on the marketplace in general over the next few years.”

Khin is expecting the company’s Diamond RS cabinet to be the talk of the show.

Diamond RS making its global debut at the show is a mechanical reel cabinet that retains player-favorite features including Diamond Glass which can overlay video elements onto the reel window.

Cabinets are a big part of IGT’s business — emphasis on “big” — with the company showing its Peak65 cabinet with a “Wheel of Fortune” game. It’s part of IGT’s Peak family of hardware in which the number represents the screen size in this case a 65-inch progressively curved display.

Meanwhile Scientific Games Corp. plans to emphasize the future of gaming with its display of iGaming content and platform with a mix of popular games its Mural and Kascada cabinets and its Player Boutique and iView player engagement systems.

“Excitement has been building for months now as our teams crafted a product lineup to showcase this year at G2E” said Barry Cottle president and CEO of Scientific. “After months of virtual gatherings we’re ready to get together safely and to show everyone what we’ve been working on.”

Company displays

Other companies have big plans.

Aristocrat Gaming will show new evolutions of its Mighty Cash Ultra 88 and Gold Stacks 88 and new innovations of Jackpot Catcher Triple Supreme and Wild Fireball Rumble.

JCM Global will show off guest experience enhancements with its DSS Flex and DSS Max R video walls secure bill validators its Gen5 thermal printers and an assortment of high-speed cash transaction systems.

Gary Platt Manufacturing will display its seating solutions to maximize guest comfort. The company delivered some of its most recent work to Resorts World Las Vegas.

“As they say ‘The show must go on.’” Bussmann said. “Now is not the time even with the current restrictions in place by the governor to push back G2E to not host meetings and conventions when they can be done in a safe environment. It’s a staple to the Las Vegas economy and the industry needs to continue its leadership to show how other sectors can follow.”

XEL,Xcel Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS91cHBlci1taWR3ZXN0LXJlbmV3YWJsZS1lbmVyZ3ktcHJvamVjdHMtc3BhcmstbmVlZC1mb3ItbW9yZS1wb3dlci1saW5lcy82MDAxMDI5NTQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Upper Midwest renewable energy projects spark need for more power lines,"Xcel Energy cut the size of the Crown Ridge II wind farm in South Dakota by one-third because of a growing problem on the Midwest's electricity grid: too much traffic.

As more renewable energy is linked to the grid transmission capacity is being strained. New projects are facing increasing costs — and longer waits — in connecting to the grid. Some like Crown Ridge II get downsized; others get canceled altogether.

""The grid is full today"" said Michael Lamb Minneapolis-based Xcel's senior vice president for transmission.

More transmission from big cross-country power lines to localized interconnections is needed particularly if aggressive government climate change goals are to be met say clean energy analysts and power industry executives.

""It is a bit of a Field of Dreams concept"" Lamb said of new transmission and new renewable projects. ""If you build it they will come online.""

But it will be difficult.

A power line next door is a tough sell even if it's transporting clean energy. One proposed high-voltage line — a $492 million conduit of wind power from Dubuque Iowa to Madison Wis. — is mired in litigation challenged by conservation groups.

And a transmission build-out would be expensive particularly if the U.S. moves to a high level ""electrification"" meaning abandoning fossil fuels for electricity-driven transportation and heating.

With high electrification and net-zero carbon emissions total U.S. transmission would need to triple by 2050 at a cost of about $2.4 trillion according to a December 2020 study by Princeton University's Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment.

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) which runs the grid in 15 states including Minnesota has estimated that nearly $30 billion in investments would be needed in the base scenario of its current long-term transmission planning effort.

Closer to home Xcel this summer proposed a new Minnesota power line from Becker to southwestern Minnesota at an estimated cost of $528 million.

Money for new transmission would ultimately come mostly from ratepayers. And utilities have an economic incentive to want more of it: Transmission gets built into their rate base providing profits over time.

Still ""you have to consider the cost of the status quo"" said Ari Peskoe director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard Law School.

""The whole point of wind and solar is they are the cheapest power by some metrics"" he said. And they lack the ""externalities"" of fossil fuels — the costs of pollution and carbon dioxide emissions to society.

Wind solar drive need for change

The U.S. electricity grid grew up over the last century as a patchwork of privately owned power networks. The core idea in the Midwest: Utilities with large centralized fossil fuel plants — and later nuclear reactors — would provide power to major population centers.

These days the utilities work together in regional electricity pools that manage the overall grid. And the nature of electricity production is undergoing a revolution with wind and solar farms often located in remote areas that must be connected to the grid.

""The physics and economics have changed dramatically over time"" said Rob Gramlich president of Grid Strategies an energy transmission consultancy.

As a result wind and solar projects are backed up in long queues across the country including the area covered by MISO an Indiana-based nonprofit that counts utilities and other energy stakeholders among its members.

""They are stuck because grid capacity is already used up"" Gramlich said.

A renewable project must wait about three years before it can be connected to MISO according to a January study by nonprofit grid modernization advocacy group Americans for a Clean Energy Grid which is led by Gramlich.

The average cost of grid interconnection for a new wind farm in MISO territory was $4.05 per megawatt hour in 2018 up from the historic cost of 85 cents per megawatt hour the study said. Renewable energy developers or owners like Xcel usually bear that interconnection cost.

""Crowned Ridge is a really good example of the issues with the MISO connection queue"" said Xcel's Lamb.

Crowned Ridge II in eastern South Dakota was planned to have a power production capacity of 300 megawatts. The grid interconnection costs for the first 200 megawatts amounted to $2.5 million and involved local transmission upgrades.

But connecting the last 100 megawatts would have triggered much more significant transmission improvements further down the line Lamb said. The cost for that part would have been $170 million. The scaled down Crown Ridge II went online in December.

Currently there are 964 projects waiting in MISO's interconnection queue representing 151 gigawatts of power production capacity the equivalent of 69 coal power plants the size of Xcel's massive three-generator Sherco complex in Becker.

A recent MISO quarterly report also showed the congestion already afflicting the grid. From June 1 to Aug. 31 congestion grew by 34 % over the previous year costing $433 million.

That cost represents power generation needed to replace cheaper power — often from wind — that couldn't be delivered due to transmission constraints. One of the costliest choke points in that period was in southern Minnesota.

Regional projects planned

MISO's last big regional transmission build-out — 17 new projects at the cost of $5.2 billion — was authorized in 2011. All but one those new power lines is completed and fully subscribed. (While MISO plans new regional transmission construction and ownership usually falls to individual utilities like Xcel which recover costs from ratepayers.)

Two of those 17 MISO power lines were part of CapX2020 the last big transmission build-out in Minnesota. Finished in 2017 CapX2020 was a $2 billion project undertaken by Xcel and several other utilities stringing 800 miles of new power lines mostly in Minnesota but also in the eastern Dakotas and western Wisconsin.

""That infrastructure was built and is fully utilized"" said Xcel's Lamb. ""Now we need a CapX for the future.""

Multistate transmission build-outs like CapX2020 can take more than a decade to complete. In the shorter term Xcel this summer introduced plans for two new high-voltage power lines that would be completed by the end of the 2020s if approved by regulators.

One would run 140 miles from the Sherco site in Becker to Lyon County in southwestern Minnesota to connect to a proposed Xcel gas plant and wind and solar farms in Minnesota. The second would be a $36 million 15-mile line from Xcel's Oak Park Heights coal plant into Wisconsin.

The two power lines have a leg up because they don't have to be run through the MISO transmission planning process. When Xcel's Minnesota coal plants are retired between 2023 and 2030 the company will retain its valuable transmission rights in Becker and Oak Park Heights.

""We think [the new Xcel lines] are a really good creative idea to maximize those existing interconnection rights"" said Allen Gleckner energy markets director for the St. Paul-based clean energy research and advocacy group Fresh Energy.

""This kind of bridges the gap before we get into more long-term transmission build-outs"" Gleckner said. ""We are kind of at a crisis point now where in the Upper Midwest it is getting harder and harder to connect.""

CLOUD — St. Thomas got a rude introduction to Division I hockey Saturday night against the defending national runner-ups.

The Tommies allowed five goals in the second period as No. 2-ranked St. Cloud State won 12-2 in their return to Herb Brooks National Hockey Center.

Eight Huskies scored goals and 15 registered assists in the season-opening win. The last time St. Cloud State scored 12 goals in a game was in January 1992 against Western Ontario.

Jami Krannila Easton Brodzinski Chase Brand and Kevin Fitzgerald had multi-goal games while eight SCSU players had two assists. Fitzgerald led with four total points.

St. Cloud State and St. Thomas will match up again tomorrow night at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul at 5 p.m.

Here are a few takeaways from a dominant St. Cloud State performance.

Husky Hockey: Five things to know for SCSU hockey's season opener on Saturday

Brodzinski is back

Last season ended two games early for Easton Brodzinski after suffering a broken femur in the NCAA Regionals and it was was incredibly unlikely he'd be ready for the 2021-22 season opener only six months later.

But there he was in the starting lineup for his fifth year with the Huskies. St. Cloud State head coach Brett Larson knew earlier this week he'd likely play and he said trainers thought playing on the leg would make him learn to trust it. Brodzinski wanted to give it a go.

Brodzinski quickly put to rest any doubt about him being at full form hustling to draw a penalty in the first period and then netting a goal from close range only 22 seconds later.

""To see him reach the 100-point mark tonight after all the hard work he put in this summer I don't know if there's been a better feeling on the bench"" Larson said.

His teammate Kevin Fitzgerald was also impressed at Brodzinski's ability to play so well coming off such a serious injury. Brodzinski scored a second goal when he buried a shot less than five minutes into the second period.

""That one definitely meant a lot to me; the guys really rallied around that too"" Brodzinski said about the opening goal. ""There were a lot of smiles on the bench ... it was definitely a little bit of a weight lifted off my shoulder.""

Special teams

St. Thomas gave the Huskies plenty of early opportunities with purple jerseys in the penalty box quickly becoming a common sight.

St. Cloud State scored seven goals on the power play also adding two shorthanded goals.

""I thought they showed good patience; they weren't forcing too many plays"" Larson said. ""They were able to not panic and make the right play.""

The Tommies were called for 10 penalties overall something they're sure to try to cut down on when the teams meet up again on Sunday night.

""The biggest thing for our power play ... is our interchangeable parts"" Fitzgerald said. ""Everybody played a couple of different spots.""

The Dog Pound is back

Last season the Huskies played the majority of games in empty rinks with some family present at late-season home games and more fans being allowed to attend during the NCAA tournament run.

But the return to a fan-filled Herb Brooks National Hockey Center was a welcome sight. The Huskies fed off the crowd and were thrilled to see the Dog Pound student section back in full force.

""That brings energy ... we haven't had that feeling in well over a year"" Larson said. ""There's nothing like scoring a goal in front of a big crowd.""

""I always get chills when I come out ... but this was something special"" Fitzgerald added.

St. Thomas joins Division I

The Tommies drew a monumental task of heading on the road to the No. 2-ranked team in the country to begin their Division I campaign.

Despite the lopsided scoreline the Tommies did show some positive signs in their debut.

Christiano Versich scored the Tommies' first Division I goal at 1:15 in the second period on the power play and Cameron Recchi added another power play goal early in the third period.

North Dakota transfer Peter Thome made some impressive early saves before being pulled as the Tommies trailed 6-1 midway through the second period. The Tommies also put pressure on David Hrenak and Joey Lamoreaux in goal forcing them to make a combined 30 saves. Hrenak got the win in goal for SCSU to set a program record with his 67th career goalie victory.

They will have to have a short memory as the puck will drop with another matchup against the Huskies at Xcel Energy Center less than 24 hours after the defeat.

""Tomorrow presents a huge challenge"" Larson said. ""You can go back through the scores year by year: if there's a big win by a team one night the next night it's gonna be tight ... St. Thomas made a really good push in the third period. They showed they're here to play.""

This came after Russian journalist Darko Todorovski revealed information about the incident in a tweet on Thursday: “Off the coast of Algeria an Israeli submarine – Dolphin type tried to track a training launch of a cruise missile Club-S from a submarine of project 636 but in turn it was discovered and pursued by two submarines of project 636. They forced it to surface and leave the area.”

The website disclosed that the incident happened during an Algerian navy drill on 29 and 30 September.

“The drill which saw the participation of many Algerian naval units was intended to demonstrate the capabilities of in-depth attack or stealth destruction of targets at sea at very long distances” the website detailed.

Opinion: There is a fine line between a cold war and open warfare

According to MENADEFENSE: “The Israeli Dolphin class submarine was spotted by passive detection tracked and forced to surface in international waters and leave the area. The decision was quickly taken to pursue it aggressively without the use of sonar in order to avoid counter detection.”

After the Israeli submarine was surrounded by Algerian submarines with two aircraft above water the crew of the Israeli submarine decided to surface: “To indicate that they were abandoning the mission and moved away from the Algerian coast.”",,,,,,,,,,,,
